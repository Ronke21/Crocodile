<text>In legal usage in the English-speaking world, an act of God, act of nature, or damnum fatale (&quot;loss arising from inevitable accident&quot;) is an event caused by no direct human action (e.g. severe or extreme weather and other natural disasters) for which individual persons are not responsible and cannot be held legally liable for loss of life, injury, or property damage. An act of God may amount to an exception to liability in contracts (as under the Hague–Visby Rules), or it may be an &quot;insured peril&quot; in an insurance policy. In Scots law, the equivalent term is &quot;damnum fatale&quot;, while most Common law proper legal systems use the term &quot;act of God&quot;.

It is legally distinct from—though often related to—a common clause found in contract law known as &quot;force majeure&quot;. In light of the scientific consensus on climate change, its modern applicability has been questioned by legal scholars.

== Contract law ==
In the law of contracts, an act of God may be interpreted as an implied defense under the rule of impossibility or impracticability. If so, the promise is discharged because of unforeseen occurrences, which were unavoidable and would result in insurmountable delay, expense, or other material breach.

Under the English common law, contractual obligations were deemed sacrosanct, so failure to honor a contract could lead to an order for specific performance or internment in a debtor&#x27;s prison. In 1863, this harsh rule was softened by the case of &quot;Taylor v Caldwell&quot; which introduced the doctrine of frustration of contract, which provided that &quot;where a contract becomes impossible to perform and neither party is at fault, both parties may be excused their obligations&quot;. In this case, a music hall was burned down by act of God before a contract of hire could be fulfilled, and the court deemed the contract frustrated.

In other contracts, such as indemnification, an act of God may be no excuse, and in fact may be the central risk assumed by the promisor—e.g.&quot;,&quot; flood insurance or crop insurance—the only variables being the timing and extent of the damage. In many cases, failure by way of ignoring obvious risks due to &quot;natural phenomena&quot; will not be sufficient to excuse performance of the obligation, even if the events are relatively rare: e.g.&quot;,&quot; the year 2000 problem in computers. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, 2-615, failure to deliver goods sold may be excused by an &quot;act of God&quot; if the absence of such act was a &quot;basic assumption&quot; of the contract, and the act has made the delivery &quot;commercially impracticable&quot;.

Recently, human activities have been claimed to be the root causes of some events previously considered natural disasters. In particular:
* Geothermal injections of water provoking earthquakes (Basel, Switzerland, 2003)
* Drilling provoking mud volcano (Java, 2008)

As a general principle of act of God, epidemic can be classified as an act of God if the epidemic was unforeseeable and renders the promise discharged if the promisor cannot avoid the effect of the epidemic by exercise of reasonable prudence, diligence and care, or by the use of those means which the situation renders reasonable to employ.

== Tort law and delict law==

===UK – England and Wales===

An act of God is an unforeseeable natural phenomenon. Explained by Lord Hobhouse in &quot;Transco plc v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council&quot; as describing an event:
===UK – Scotland===

In &quot;Tennant v Earl of Glasgow&quot; (1864 2 M (HL) 22) Lord Chancellor Westbury described a case as: &quot;what is denominated in the law of Scotland &quot;damnum fatale&quot; — occurrences and circumstances which no human foresight can provide against, and of which human prudence is not bound to recognize the possibility; and which, when they do occur, therefore, are calamities that do not involve the obligation of paying for the consequences that may result from them.&quot;

===United States===
In the law of torts, an &quot;act of God&quot; may be asserted as a type of intervening cause, the lack of which would have avoided the cause or diminished the result of liability (e.g., but for the earthquake, the old, poorly constructed building would be standing). However, foreseeable results of unforeseeable causes may still raise liability. For example, a bolt of lightning strikes a ship carrying volatile compressed gas, resulting in the expected explosion. Liability may be found if the carrier did not use reasonable care to protect against sparks—regardless of their origins. Similarly, strict liability could defeat a defense for an &quot;act of God&quot; where the defendant has created the conditions under which any accident would result in harm. For example, a long-haul truck driver takes a shortcut on a back road and the load is lost when the road is destroyed in an unforeseen flood. Other cases find that a common carrier is not liable for the unforeseeable forces of nature. See &quot;Memphis &amp; Charlestown RR Co. v. Reeves&quot;, 77 U.S. 176 (1870).

One example is that of &quot;rainmaker&quot; Charles Hatfield, who was hired in 1915 by the city of San Diego to fill the Morena reservoir to capacity with rainwater for $10,000. The region was soon flooded by heavy rains, nearly bursting the reservoir&#x27;s dam, killing nearly 20 people, destroying 110 bridges (leaving 2), knocking out telephone and telegraph lines, and causing an estimated $3.5 million in damage in total. When the city refused to pay him (he had forgotten to sign the contract), he sued the city. The floods were ruled an act of God, excluding him from liability but also from payment.

<text>Carmen Laforet (Barcelona 6 September 1921 – Madrid, 28 February 2004) was a Spanish author who wrote in the period after the Spanish Civil War. An important European writer, her works contributed to the school of Existentialist Literature and her first novel &quot;Nada&quot; continued the Spanish &quot;tremendismo&quot; literary style begun by Camilo José Cela with his novel, &quot;La familia de Pascual Duarte&quot;. She received the Premio Nadal in 1944.

==Biography==
Laforet was born in Barcelona, Spain, but at the age of 2 she moved with her family to the Canary Islands where she spent her childhood. At age 12 she suffered the loss of her mother, and her father subsequently married a woman disliked by Laforet and her siblings (unsavory experiences portrayed in much of her literature). In 1939 at the age of 18, Laforet left for Barcelona where she studied Philosophy at the University of Barcelona while living with relatives. In 1942 she departed for Madrid where she studied Law at the Universidad Complutense. During her second year, she withdrew from classes to devote herself completely to writing, and between January and September 1944 she penned her first novel, &quot;Nada&quot;, which earned Editorial Destino&#x27;s Nadal Prize in its first year of publication (1945). A novel of female adolescent development, &quot;Nada&quot; is considered a classic in 20th century Spanish literature, and deals with such themes as existentialism and the adolescent search for identity.

Laforet maintained a very distrustful relationship with her critics, especially after she struggled to match the outstanding critical acclaim of her first novel. However, she did publish a total of five novels: the 1952 publication of &quot;La Isla y los demonios&quot;, which is essentially the prequel to &quot;Nada&quot;; her 1955 &quot;La mujer nueva&quot;, motivated by her re-discovery of her Catholic faith and recipient of the Premio Menorca; her 1963 &quot;La insolación&quot;, the initial installment of the trilogy &quot;Tres pasos fuera del tiempo&quot;; and finally the posthumous psychological novel &quot;Al volver la esquina&quot;, published in May 2004.

Following her visit to the U.S. as a guest of the State Department in 1965, Laforet published her travel notes entitled &quot;Parelelo 35&quot; in 1967. Her friendship with fellow Spanish author and U.S. resident Ramón J. Sender was revealed in a series of letters published in 2003 entitled &quot;Puedo contar contigo&quot;. She also authored short stories, the majority of which were published in a 1952 collection entitled &quot;La muerta&quot;, as well as novelettes that were published in a 1954 collection entitled &quot;La llamada&quot;. Four additional short stories — &quot;El infierno,&quot; &quot;Recién casados,&quot; &quot;El alivio,&quot; and &quot;El secreto de la gata&quot; — were published in the journals &quot;Ínsula&quot; (1944 &amp; 1952), &quot;Destino&quot; (June 1953) and &quot;Bazar&quot; (March 1952) respectively. In 1987 she started post-graduate studies in Literature at Georgetown University.

During her later years Laforet suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, eventually losing the ability to speak. She died in Madrid on 28 February 2004.

&quot;Nada&quot;, her most successful novel, has remained consistently in print. The publication in 2003 of &quot;Puedo contar contigo,&quot; a selection of her correspondence with Ramón J. Sender edited by Israel Rolón Barada, and the reissue of her 1955 novel, &quot;La mujer nueva&quot;, with a prologue by the same editor, however, led to renewed interest in her work, bolstered by a new English translation of &quot;Nada&quot; by Edith Grossman in 2007. In February 2007, as a commemoration of the third anniversary of her death, the Editorial Menoscuarto published for the first time a compilation of all her short stories, including five previously unpublished stories. In 2009 Cristina Cerezales published a second book about her mother, &quot;Música Blanca&quot; (Destino).

== Tributes ==
In 2010 a school with her name was built in the neighborhood of Valderribas, in the district of Vicálvaro (Madrid).

In 2011 she was awarded, posthumously, with the Can de Plata de Gran Canaria, in the category of Arts, given by the Cabildo Insular de Gran Canaria.

There are some streets with her name in Estepona (Málaga), in the neighborhood of Aguas Vivas (Guadalajara), in Majadahonda, in Torrejon de Ardoz and in the neighborhood of Soto del Henares (Madrid). Some streets in the towns of Las Palmas and San Bartolomé de Tirajana on the island of Gran Canaria were also named Carmen Laforet.

In 2004 a series of biographies dedicated to Carmen Laforet were published and directed by the writer Nuria Amat.

In 2014 The Instituto Cervantes in New York (United States) paid tribute to the author in one of its cultural activities to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the publication of her book &quot;Nada.&quot;

A square in Barcelona was named after her: Plaça de Carmen Laforet. The square has a plaque where it can be read in Catalan: &quot;Carmen Laforet (Barcelona 1921-Madrid 2004)... Escriptora ... Va néixer en aquesta casa, font d&#x27;inspiració de la seva primera novel·la Nada&quot; which means: &quot;Carmen Laforet (Barcelona 1921-Madrid 2004).. Writer ... Was born in this house, the source of inspiration for her first novel Nada.&quot;

== Filmography ==
In 1947, a version of the novel &quot;Nada&quot; was brought to the big screen. The full-length film was directed by Edgar Nevile. Actors such as Conchita Montes, Rafael Bardem, María Denis and Fosco Giachetti, among others, took part on it. Because of the censorship of those years, thirty minutes of the film were cut and many of the scenes shot in Barcelona were obliterated.

Later, in 1956, Argentina brought to the big screen what would be an adaptation of the novel Nada, a black and white drama directed by Leopoldo Torre Nilsson.

== Works ==
The literary production of the writer is wide. After the death of her mother, her father married a woman with whom Carmen did not have a good relationship. This situation was reflected in three of her works. These works, which have orphans as main characters are &quot;Nada (1945),&quot; &quot;La isla y sus demonios (1952)&quot; and &quot;La insolación (1963).&quot;

The Spanish writer tried to combine her feelings in each of her works. Several authors insist on her feminist vision, although her mystical vision of the world, should be pointed out, especially in her work &quot;La mujer nueva,&quot; whose main point is the faith of the main character. The main character of this work is Paulina, a woman who goes from criticizing the Church to practising the Catholic religion, a change she chooses on her own. Paulina stopped having a sinful life, as she had a son born out of wedlock and she also had a relationship with another man. Thus, in this work the freedom of the women to choose another way of life is joined with mysticism. This could be due to the religious belief of the author, because in the correspondence that remained for a long time with writer Ramon J. Sender, she claims to believe in God.

Intrigue and mystery are also present in many of her works. This author could be considered the precursor of the detective novel in Spain because, although currently this is a rising genre and it was started some time ago, she had done it thirty years earlier than other authors.

Laforet&#x27;s works paint a dark picture of Spanish society under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, in some cases using foreign characters visiting Spain to present an outsider&#x27;s view, for example, Martin, a character of her work &quot;Al volver de la esquina&quot;, published posthumously by the publisher Destino in 2004, the same year as her death. The complexity of the narrative structure, which testifies the evolution of the author&#x27;s narrative, is remarkable. &quot;Al volver de la esquina&quot; is part of a trilogy entitled &quot;Tres pasos fuera del tiempo&quot;, together with &quot;La insolación&quot; and &quot;Jaque mate.&quot; This is an unfinished trilogy because, despite having talked about it in her correspondence with Ramón J. Sender, she died before publication of the final volume (in fact, nobody knows whether or not it was actually written).

==Legacy==
Since Laforet&#x27;s death on 28 February 2004, renewed critical attention has focused on her lesser known works (essentially everything published after &quot;Nada&quot;), yet undoubtedly the public will always think of &quot;Nada&quot; when Laforet&#x27;s name is mentioned, as evidenced by the Spanish phrase, &quot;Después de &quot;Nada,&quot; nada,&quot; or &quot;After &quot;Nada,&quot; nothing.&quot; On her 100th birthday, Laforet was honoured with a Google Doodle.

<text>The Aroostook River is a tributary of the Saint John River in the U.S. state of Maine and the Canadian province of New Brunswick. Its basin is the largest sub-drainage of the Saint John River.

The name is derived from the Malecite name &quot;Wool-ahs-took&quot;, translated by Ganong as &quot;good river for everything&quot;. It appears as &quot;Arassatuk&quot; (DeRozier, 1699).

==History==
In the late 1830s, the territory comprising the river&#x27;s drainage area was the scene of the Aroostook War, a boundary dispute between the United States and the United Kingdom.

==Geography==
The river rises in northeastern Maine from the confluence of Millinocket Stream and Munsungan Stream in Maine Township 8, Range 8, WELS, in northern Penobscot County. The river winds east and northeast through Aroostook County. It runs through Ashland, and passes north of Presque Isle and east of Caribou. It joins the Saint John River in Aroostook, New Brunswick, after crossing the Canada–United States border.

The United States government maintains two river flow gages on the Aroostook. The first is located near Masardis, Maine () where the rivershed is . The second is at Washburn, Maine () where the rivershed is . By Fort Fairfield, Maine the rivershed is . At Masardis, the maximum recorded flow is and the minimum per second. At Washburn, the maximum recorded flow is per second and the minimum per second. Annual maximum flows occur during the spring snow melt and minimums in the fall. The highest flood levels at both gages occurred during ice-dam induced floods, which occur relatively often on this river. Such flooding occurred in March and April 1999, April and May 2003, and April 2004.

The International Appalachian Trail runs along the river for several miles. Hikers cross the river, pass through customs, and cross the international boundary at Fort Fairfield, Maine.
==Nature==
The river has a small run of Atlantic salmon. From 1998 to 2001, the number of adults returning to the river ranged from seventeen to thirty.

<text>José Francisco Barrundia y Cepeda (May 12, 1787, Guatemala City – August 4, 1854, New York City) was a liberal Central American politician. From June 26, 1829 to September 16, 1830 he was interim president of the United Provinces of Central America.

==Background==
Barrundia was born in Guatemala. He studied at the Colegio Tridentino, where he became a bachelor of philosophy on March 19, 1803. His brother Juan Barrundia was head of the province of Guatemala in 1829.

José Barrundia was considered an outstanding intellectual and man of letters, fluent in several languages. He translated into Spanish the Livingston Code (penal code of Louisiana) in order to adapt it to the country. He was a populist member of the Central American Congress and in his later career he served as minister plenipotentiary of Honduras in New York City.

==Political career and presidency==
In 1825 he was elected the first vice president of the United Provinces of Central America, under Manuel José Arce, but he declined the office. He did serve as senator. From Congress he criticized the increasing conservatism of Arce. In 1826 Arce unconstitutionally dissolved the Congress, and this led to civil war.

He was a strong supporter of Honduran liberal Francisco Morazán. With the fall of Arce and the triumph of Morazán, Barrundia became interim president of the United Provinces (July 1829), with a mandate to organize elections. Elections were held in July 1830, and in September Morazán succeeded him as president.

==After serving as president==
From 1831 to 1835 he was secretary of education of the state government of Guatemala, under Mariano Gálvez. It was during this time that he translated the Livingston Code. However, he became estranged from Gálvez, and in 1838 contributed to his fall from power. This led to the ascent of Conservative Rafael Carrera. In 1839 he proposed to the Guatemalan Congress the withdrawal of the state from the Central American Federation. This was approved by Congress.

In 1848 he founded the newspaper &quot;Album Republicano&quot;.

A strong supporter of human rights, in 1850 he opposed Carrera, because of his bloody regime and his ignorance. He also challenged the influence of the Church. Before his death he became minister of Honduras, negotiating in Washington, D.C. for annexation to the United States.

Though not a rich man, Barrundia refused his salary for the public positions he held.

He died in New York in 1854 while serving as Honduran minister plenipotentiary. Guatemalan President Manuel Estrada Cabrera had his remains repatriated in 1913.

<text>Đồng Nai is a province in the Southeast region of Vietnam, located east and northeast of Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). The capital city and the largest city in Đồng Nai is Biên Hòa.

==Geography==
Đồng Nai is in southeastern Vietnam and bordered by: Bình Thuận, Lâm Đồng, Bình Dương and Bình Phước, Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu, and Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). Đồng Nai has an advanced traffic system with many backbone national roads crossing it, such as: National Route 1A, National Route 20, National Route 51 and the North–South railway lines; located adjacent to the Saigon Port and Tan Son Nhat International Airport, it offers many advantages to economic activities in the area. Its location is very important for the development of the Southern economic main hub and a junction of the South Eastern and Tây Nguyên Highland.

Đồng Nai is based essentially on the system of lakes, dams and rivers, of which Trị An Lake with an area of 323 km² and over 60 rivers, rivulets and canals are very favorable for the development of a number of aquatic products: raft bred fish and shrimp. The seasonal tropical forests are protected in Cát Tiên National Park, located in the north of Đồng Nai and the adjacent Vĩnh Cửu Nature Reserve; the former has been recognized internationally as a significant biosphere reserve. From the mountainous area, Đồng Nai River, Vietnam&#x27;s largest internal waterway, flows southeast through Biên Hòa City, Ho Chi Minh City, and villages along its way. This river plays a crucial role in providing fresh water for the entire region.

===Climate===
Đồng Nai lies in the monsoon tropical zone and is affected by the north-east and south-west monsoon. It is also under the influence of the Pacific Ocean tropical atmosphere between April and October. The climate is divided into two distinct seasons: the rainy season lasts from March or April to November and the dry season from December to March or April of the following year. The average temperature is between 23.9 and 29.0 °C, much lower than the standard level of tropical regions (26-30 °C). Its annual rainfall is quite high with 1,500 - 2,700 mm.

On average, the weather is sunny for 4.0-9.5 hours a day and does not exceed 11.5 hours per day, even on the hottest and sunniest days. Total rainy days within a year are between 120 and 170 days (the standard level of tropical regions is 150–160 days) with a total rainfall of some 1,500 - 2,750 mm. The average humidity is around 80 - 82% and humidity in the dry season is 10-12%, lower than that of the rainy season; humidity varies considerably between areas.

Đồng Nai&#x27;s weather with regular sunshine, rain, and high humidity, equally found in the localities, facilitates agricultural production and development of industrial, cultural and tourist activities.

===Resources===
Đồng Nai is plentiful with resources such as forests, granite mines, construction stone, clay, kaolin, pozzolan, sand and gravel.

==Demographics==
Đồng Nai is one of Vietnam&#x27;s most populous provinces (ranked fifth) with a population of 2,838,600 in 2014. Its population has been growing rapidly in recent years, mainly driven by migrant workers coming to the province to work in factories. Population growth was 1.95% in 2005, between 2.5% from 2008 to 2010 and 3.5% in 2011. Net migration contributed 2.2% to this figure. Đồng Nai is second only to Bình Dương province in both population growth and net migration.

The population of Đồng Nai is primarily the dominant Kinh (Viet) ethnicity, although there are residents of the Chinese, Stieng, Mạ, Nùng, Tay, and Cham minorities.

==Transportation==
Đồng Nai has made significant progress in upgrading its transport infrastructure, especially roads. National highways in the province have a total length of 244.5 km and have been improved and widened up to level 1 and 2 standards (National Highway No. 5 and 6) or up to third grade like National Highway No. 20 to Đà Lạt. The total roads system in the province is 3,339 kilometers long, of which almost 700 kilometers are tar roads. All communes and wards are connected to the road network.

Under scheme in the near future, highways to Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu province and Ho Chi Minh City, a railway connecting Biên Hòa to Vũng Tàu, upgrading provincial road No. 726 and connecting National Highway No. 20 and No. 1 with National Highway No. 51 will create a complete system, promoting socioeconomic development in the province and region.

A new airport, Long Thành International Airport, is planned for construction in Long Thành district, Đồng Nai, approximately 40 km northeast of Ho Chi Minh City. Upon completion, it will handle international flights in place of Tan Son Nhat International Airport, which will serve domestic flights.

==Administrative divisions==
Đồng Nai is subdivided into 11 district-level sub-divisions:

* 9 districts:
** Cẩm Mỹ
** Định Quán
** Long Thành
** Nhơn Trạch
** Tân Phú
** Thống Nhất
** Trảng Bom
** Vĩnh Cửu
** Xuân Lộc
* 2 provincial cities:
** Biên Hòa (capital)
** Long Khánh

They are further subdivided into eight commune-level towns (or townlets), 122 communes, and 40 wards.

==Economy==
Đồng Nai is one of Vietnam&#x27;s main manufacturing centers and one of the most developed provinces.

===Agriculture===
Despite its strong focus on industrial development, Đồng Nai still has a substantial agricultural sector. Agricultural land accounts for 47% of the province&#x27;s area as of 2011, a total of 277,600 ha. This is lower than in other provinces in the Southeast region, except for Ho Chi Minh City. Cereals were grown on 118,600 ha in 2011, an area that has been decreasing gradually in recent years, from 139,300 ha in 2005. The output of rice has, however, remained stable and was at 335,200t in 2011. The province also produced 305,300t of maize, making it the largest producer of maize outside the country&#x27;s mountainous regions and contributing 6.3% to the national maize output. Đồng Nai also produced 619,700t of sugar cane (3.5% of the national output), sweet potatoes and cassava.

Đồng Nai is the largest livestock producer among Vietnam&#x27;s provinces and there are plans to further invest in the sector. The government reserved 15,000 ha for livestock farming in 2012, mostly for poultry and pigs.
In 2011 there were 1.33 million pigs and 10.655 million poultry. Despite not being located along the coast, Đồng Nai produced 41,600t of fishery products in 2011. Over 90% of this was produced in 33,500 ha of aquaculture farms. This makes Đồng Nai the largest aquaculture producer outside the Mekong Delta.

===Industry===
Đồng Nai is one of Vietnam&#x27;s main manufacturing centers. It has attracted 9.1% of FDI into Vietnam by 2011, an accumulated US$18.2 billion, the fourth largest after Ho Chi Minh City, Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu province and Hanoi. Industrial gross output in 2011 was VND 314 trillion, 10.6% of the national value. It has received a broad range of FDI projects, including a Bosch auto component plant, a Toshiba motor plant, a PepsiCo beverage factory, a Posco steel plant, and a Nestlé coffee factory.

== Business environment ==
On Vietnam&#x27;s Provincial Competitiveness Index 2023, a key tool for evaluating the business environment in Vietnam’s provinces, Dong Nai received a score of 66.28. This was an improvement from 2022 in which the province received a score of 65.67. In 2023, the province received its highest scores on the &#x27;Time Costs&#x27; and &#x27;Business Support Policy&#x27; criterion and lowest on &#x27;Policy Bias&#x27; and &#x27;Labour Policy&#x27;.

==Ecology==
A large part of Đồng Nai Biosphere Reserve, include Nam Cát Tiên, is located in Dong Nai province.

Tri An Dam provides electricity, reduces flooding, and produces drinking water.

As a result of the Vietnam War, some areas around Bien Hoa Air Base were dioxin pollution. The authorities are trying to clean up these areas.

As defined by a 2008 World Bank survey, the province is one of the five most-polluted in Vietnam.

<doc id="529129" wikidata="Q1433911" url="?curid=529129" title="Manuel José Arce">
<text>Manuel José Arce y Fagoaga (1 January 1787 – 14 December 1847) was a Salvadoran statesman and military officer who served as the first president of the Federal Republic of Central America from 1825 to 1829.

== Background ==
Manuel José Arce was the son of Spaniard Bernardo José de Arce, the Colonial Intendant of the Intendancy of San Salvador from 1800 until 1801, and Antonia Fagoaga. He was born in the Intendancy of San Salvador, what is now El Salvador. In 1801 he was sent to Guatemala to continue his education. There he graduated in philosophy from the Colegio de San Francisco Borja. He began the study of medicine at the Universidad de San Carlos de Borromeo, but it was interrupted because of his father&#x27;s sickness. In December 1808, he married Felipa de Aranzamendi y Aguiar in San Salvador.

== Independence movement ==
Arce joined the movement for independence from Spain, joining in the first Cry for Independence on 5 November 1811 in San Salvador. It was led by his uncle, José Matías Delgado, the vicar of San Salvador. The rebels held the government for nearly a month before royal authority was restored from Guatemala. Arce was also involved in the second uprising that began 22 January 1814. This cost him four years in prison.

He strongly opposed the Mexican Empire of Agustín de Iturbide and its efforts to annex Central America. In April 1822 Manuel Arzú, in command of Guatemalan troops supporting Mexico, occupied the cities of Santa Ana, El Salvador, and Sonsonate. On 3 June 1822, Arzú entered San Salvador, reaching the Plaza Mayor. Nine hours of fighting resulted in many casualties and burned houses. Colonel Arce was one of the commanders of the Salvadoran defenders.

Arce was also a member of the resistance towards the movement that was requesting annexation to the United States. The government of El Salvador had requested annexation to the United States on 2 December 1822.

In October 1823 he left the United States to return to El Salvador. He stopped in Mexico. There he tried to raise a force to liberate Cuba from Spanish rule but it failed. 

== As president ==
Also in October 1823 he was elected a member of the executive triumvirate of Central America. He accepted this post on 15 March 1824 on his return to the country, serving until 20 October 1824. During this time the government succeeded in pacifying Nicaragua, with a minimum of violence.

Presidential elections were held in 1825, and José Cecilio del Valle won the most votes. The Liberals, however, controlled the federal Congress, and they decided that Valle had not won an absolute majority. They chose Arce as president. He served from 29 April 1825 to 13 April 1829.

He soon lost the support of the Liberals in Congress. After 1826 neither house of the federal Congress met. Arce obtained some support from the clergy and the Conservative Party, but there were difficulties with the State of Guatemala. He deposed the Guatemalan state governor, Juan Barrundia, a Liberal, and replaced him. The Salvadoran state government was angry and rebelled, and a civil war started that lasted from 1826 to 1829. On 1829 Arce called Vice President Mariano Beltranena y Llano to temporarily exercise the presidency, but when Arce wanted to resume it, Beltranena refused and remained in office until April 1829 when the liberals troops entered Guatemala City and overthrew his administration.

== Later life ==
In 1832 he was in Soconusco in (then of Guatemala, now part of Mexico), where he organized a military expedition against the federal government of Francisco Morazán. Arce was defeated on 24 February 1832.

He finally returned to El Salvador in 1842, but soon he fled to Honduras and Guatemala. In April and May 1844 he directed some armed attempts to overthrow Francisco Malespín in El Salvador. He returned again to the country in the middle of 1845. He left politics for a more private life in 1846, working on his book &quot;Brief Indications for the Reorganization of Central America&quot;.

Arce died in poverty in San Salvador on 14 December 1847. His remains were interred at La Merced Church in San Salvador until 7 January 2003 when his remains were relocated to the Military Museum of the Armed Forces of El Salvador.

On 28 November 1947 the Legislature elevated the town of El Chilamatal to a city, renaming it in the process city of Ciudad Arce.

<doc id="529134" wikidata="Q154759" url="?curid=529134" title="Sven Hedin">
<text>Sven Anders Hedin, KNO1kl RVO, (19 February 1865 – 26 November 1952) was a Swedish geographer, topographer, explorer, photographer, travel writer and illustrator of his own works. During four expeditions to Central Asia, he made the Transhimalaya known in the West and located sources of the Brahmaputra, Indus and Sutlej Rivers. He also mapped lake Lop Nur, and the remains of cities, grave sites and the Great Wall of China in the deserts of the Tarim Basin. In his book &quot;Från pol till pol&quot; (&quot;From Pole to Pole&quot;), Hedin describes a journey through Asia and Europe between the late 1880s and the early 1900s. While traveling, Hedin visited Turkey, the Caucasus, Tehran, Iraq, lands of the Kyrgyz people and the Russian Far East, India, China and Japan. The posthumous publication of his &quot;Central Asia Atlas&quot; marked the conclusion of his life&#x27;s work.

==Overview==
At 15 years of age, Hedin witnessed the triumphal return of the Arctic explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld after his first navigation of the Northern Sea Route. From that moment on, young Sven aspired to become an explorer. His studies under the German geographer and China expert, Ferdinand Freiherr von Richthofen, awakened a love of Germany in Hedin and strengthened his resolve to undertake expeditions to Central Asia to explore the last uncharted areas of Asia. After obtaining a doctorate, learning several languages and dialects, and undertaking two trips through Persia, he ignored the advice of Ferdinand von Richthofen to continue his geographic studies to acquaint himself with geographical research methodology; the result was that Hedin had to leave the evaluation of his expedition results later to other scientists.

Between 1894 and 1908, in three daring expeditions through the mountains and deserts of Central Asia, he mapped and researched parts of Chinese Turkestan (now Xinjiang) and Tibet which had been unexplored by Europeans until then. Upon his return to Stockholm in 1909 he was received as triumphantly as Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld. In 1902, he became the last Swede (to date) to be raised to the untitled nobility and was considered one of Sweden&#x27;s most important personalities. As a member of two scientific academies, he had a voice in the selection of Nobel Prize winners for both science and literature. Hedin never married and had no children, rendering his family line now extinct.

Hedin&#x27;s expedition notes laid the foundations for a precise mapping of Central Asia. He was one of the first European scientific explorers to employ indigenous scientists and research assistants on his expeditions. Although primarily an explorer, he was also the first to unearth the ruins of ancient Buddhist cities in Chinese Central Asia. However, as his main interest in archaeology was finding ancient cities, he had little interest in gathering data thorough scientific excavations. Of small stature, with a bookish, bespectacled appearance, Hedin nevertheless proved himself a determined explorer, surviving several close brushes with death from hostile forces and the elements over his long career. His scientific documentation and popular travelogues, illustrated with his own photographs, watercolor paintings and drawings, his adventure stories for young readers and his lecture tours abroad made him world-famous.

As a renowned expert on Turkestan and Tibet, he was able to obtain unrestricted access to European and Asian monarchs and politicians as well as to their geographical societies and scholarly associations. They all sought to purchase his exclusive knowledge about the power vacuum in Central Asia with gold medals, diamond-encrusted grand crosses, honorary doctorates and splendid receptions, as well as with logistic and financial support for his expeditions. Hedin, in addition to Nikolai Przhevalsky, Sir Francis Younghusband, and Sir Aurel Stein, was an active player in the British-Russian struggle for influence in Central Asia, known as the Great Game. Their travels were supported because they filled in the &quot;white spaces&quot; in contemporary maps, providing valuable information.

Hedin was honored in ceremonies in:
* 1890 by King Oscar II of Sweden
* 1890 by Shah Nāser ad-Dīn Schah
* 1896, 1909 by Czar Nicholas II of Russia
* from 1898 frequently by Kaiser Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary
* 1902 by the Viceroy of India Lord Curzon
* 1903, 1914, 1917, 1926, 1936 by Kaiser Wilhelm II
* 1906 by the Viceroy of India Lord Minto
* 1907, 1926, 1933 by the 9th Panchen Lama Thubten Choekyi Nyima
* 1908 by Emperor Mutsuhito
* 1910 by Pope Pius X
* 1910 by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt
* 1915 and subsequently by Hindenburg
* 1929 and 1935 by Chiang Kai-shek
* 1935, 1939, 1940 (twice) by Adolf Hitler.

Hedin was, and remained, a figure of the 19th century who clung to its visions and methods also in the 20th century. This prevented him from discerning the fundamental social and political upheavals of the 20th century and aligning his thinking and actions accordingly.

Concerned about the security of Scandinavia, he favored the Swedish Navy&#x27;s construction of the battleship . In World War I he specifically allied himself in his publications with the German Empire and its conduct of the war. Because of this political involvement, his scientific reputation was damaged among the Allied powers, along with his memberships in their geographical societies and learned associations, as well as any support for his planned expeditions.

After a less-than-successful lecture tour in 1923 through North America and Japan, he traveled on to Beijing to carry out an expedition to Chinese Turkestan (modern Xinjiang), but the region&#x27;s unstable political situation thwarted this intention. He instead traveled through Mongolia by car and through Siberia aboard the Trans-Siberian Railway.

With financial support from the governments of Sweden and Germany, he led, between 1927 and 1935, an international and interdisciplinary Sino-Swedish Expedition to carry out scientific investigations in Mongolia and Chinese Turkestan, with the participation of 37 scientists from six countries. Despite Chinese counter-demonstrations and after months of negotiations in the Republic of China, was he able to make the expedition also a Chinese one by obtaining Chinese research commissions and the participation of Chinese scientists. He also concluded a contract which guaranteed freedom of travel for this expedition which, because of its arms, 300 camels, and activities in a war theater, resembled an invading army. However, the financing remained Hedin&#x27;s private responsibility.

Because of failing health, the civil war in Chinese Turkestan, and a long period of captivity, Hedin, by then 70 years of age, had a difficult time after the currency depreciation of the Great Depression raising the money required for the expedition, the logistics for assuring the supplying of the expedition in an active war zone, and obtaining access for the expedition&#x27;s participants to a research area intensely contested by local warlords. Nevertheless, the expedition was a scientific success. The archaeological artifacts which had been sent to Sweden were scientifically assessed for three years (or four years according to Chung-Chang Shen (C.C. Shen), who was the administrative officer for the Sino-Swedish Expedition Council, and drafted the contract), after which they were returned to China under the terms of the contract. 

Starting in 1937, the scientific material assembled during the expedition was published in over 50 volumes by Hedin and other expedition participants, thereby making it available for worldwide research on eastern Asia. When he ran out of money to pay printing costs, he pawned his extensive and valuable library, which filled several rooms, making possible the publication of additional volumes.

In 1935, Hedin made his exclusive knowledge about Central Asia available, not only to the Swedish government, but also to foreign governments such as China and Germany, in lectures and personal discussions with political representatives of Chiang Kai-shek and Adolf Hitler.

Although he was not a National Socialist, Hedin&#x27;s hope that Nazi Germany would protect Scandinavia from invasion by the Soviet Union, brought him in dangerous proximity to representatives of National Socialism, who exploited him as an author. This destroyed his reputation and put him into social and scientific isolation. However, in correspondence and personal conversations with leading Nazis, his successful intercessions achieved the pardoning of ten people condemned to death and the release or survival of Jews who had been deported to Nazi concentration camps.

At the end of the war, United States Army troops deliberately confiscated documents relating to Hedin&#x27;s planned &quot;Central Asia Atlas&quot;. The &quot;U.S. Army Map Service&quot; later solicited Hedin&#x27;s assistance and financed the printing and publication of his life&#x27;s work, the &quot;Central Asia Atlas&quot;. Whoever compares this atlas with &quot;Adolf Stielers Hand Atlas&quot; of 1891 can appreciate what Hedin accomplished between 1893 and 1935.

Although Hedin&#x27;s research was taboo in Germany and Sweden because of his conduct relating to Nazi Germany, and stagnated for decades in Germany, the scientific documentation of his expeditions was translated into Chinese by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and incorporated into Chinese research. Following recommendations made by Hedin to the Chinese Nationalist government in 1935, the routes he selected were used to construct streets and train tracks, as well as dams and canals to irrigate new farms being established in the Tarim and Yanji basins in Xinjiang and the deposits of iron, manganese, oil, coal and gold discovered during the Sino-Swedish Expedition were opened up for mining. Among the discoveries of this expedition should also be counted the many Asian plants and animals unheard of until that date, as well as fossil remains of dinosaurs and other extinct animals. Many were named after Hedin, the species-level scientific classification being &quot;hedini&quot;. But one discovery remained unknown to Chinese researchers until the turn of the millennium: in the Lop Nur desert, Hedin discovered in 1933 and 1934 ruins of signal towers which prove that the Great Wall of China once extended as far west as Xinjiang.
From 1931 until his death in 1952, Hedin lived in Stockholm in a modern high-rise in a preferred location, the address being Norr Mälarstrand 66. He lived with his siblings in the upper three stories and from the balcony he had a wide view over Riddarfjärden Bay and Lake Mälaren to the island of Långholmen. In the entryway to the stairwell is to be found a decorative stucco relief map of Hedin&#x27;s research area in Central Asia and a relief of the Lama temple, a copy of which he had brought to Chicago for the 1933 World&#x27;s Fair.

On 29 October 1952, Hedin&#x27;s will granted the rights to his books and his extensive personal effects to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; the Sven Hedin Foundation established soon thereafter holds all the rights of ownership.

Hedin died at Stockholm in 1952. The memorial service was attended by representatives of the Swedish royal household, the Swedish government, the Swedish Academy, and the diplomatic service. He is buried in the cemetery of Adolf Fredrik church in Stockholm.

==Biography==
===Childhood influences===
Sven Hedin was born in Stockholm, the son of Ludwig Hedin, Chief Architect of Stockholm. 
When he was 15 years old Hedin witnessed the triumphal return of the Swedish Arctic explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld after his first navigation of the Northern Sea Route.

He describes this experience in his book &quot;My Life as an Explorer&quot; as follows:

On 24 April 1880, the steamer Vega sailed into Stockholms ström. The entire city was illuminated. The buildings around the harbor glowed in the light of innumerable lamps and torches. Gas flames depicted the constellation of Vega on the castle. Amidst this sea of light the famous ship glided into the harbor. I was standing on the Södermalm heights with my parents and siblings, from which we had a superb view. I was gripped by great nervous tension. I will remember this day until I die, as it was decisive for my future. Thunderous jubilation resounded from quays, streets, windows and rooftops. &quot;That is how I want to return home some day,&quot; I thought to myself.
===First trip to Iran (Persia)===
In May 1885, Hedin graduated from Beskowska secondary school in Stockholm. He then accepted an offer to accompany the student Erhard Sandgren as his private tutor to Baku, where Sandgren&#x27;s father was working as an engineer in the oil fields of Robert Nobel. Afterward he attended a course in topography for general staff officers for one month in summer 1885 and took a few weeks of instruction in portrait drawing; this comprised his entire training in those areas.

On 15 August 1885, he traveled to Baku with Erhard Sandgren and instructed him there for seven months, and he himself began to learn the Latin, French, German, Persian, Russian, English and Tatar languages. He later learned several Persian dialects as well as Turkish, Kyrgyz, Mongolian, Tibetan and some Chinese.

On 6 April 1886, Hedin left Baku for Iran (then called Persia), traveling by paddle steamer over the Caspian Sea, riding through the Alborz Range to Tehran, Esfahan, Shiraz and the harbor city of Bushehr. From there he took a ship up the Tigris River to Baghdad (then in Ottoman Empire), returning to Tehran via Kermanshah, and then travelling through the Caucasus and over the Black Sea to Constantinople. Hedin then returned to Sweden, arriving on 18 September 1886.

In 1887, Hedin published a book about these travels entitled &quot;Through Persia, Mesopotamia and the Caucasus&quot;.

===Studies===
From 1886 to 1888, Hedin studied under the geologist Waldemar Brøgger in Stockholm and Uppsala the subjects of geology, mineralogy, zoology and Latin. In December 1888, he became a &quot;Candidate in Philosophy&quot;. From October 1889 to March 1890 he studied in Berlin under Ferdinand Freiherr von Richthofen.

===Second trip to Iran===
On 12 May 1890, he accompanied as interpreter and vice-consul a Swedish legation to Iran which was to present the Shah of Iran with the insignia of the Order of the Seraphim. As part of the Swedish legation, he was at an audience of the shah Naser al-Din Shah Qajar in Tehran. He spoke with him and later accompanied him to the Elburz Mountain Range. On 11 July 1890, he and three others climbed Mount Damavand where he collected primary material for his dissertation. Starting in September he traveled on the Silk Road via cities Mashhad, Ashgabat, Bukhara, Samarkand, Tashkent and Kashgar to the western outskirts of the Taklamakan Desert. On the trip home, he visited the grave of the Russian Asian scholar, Nikolai Przhevalsky in Karakol on the shore of Lake Issyk Kul. On 29 March 1891, he was back in Stockholm. He published the books &quot;King Oscar&#x27;s Legation to the Shah of Persia in 1890&quot; and &quot;Through Chorasan and Turkestan&quot; about this journey.

===Doctorate and career path===
On 27 April 1892, Hedin traveled to Berlin to continue his studies under Ferdinand Freiherr von Richthofen. Beginning of July he went to University of Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, attending lectures by Alfred Kirchhoff. Yet in the same month, he received the degree of &quot;Doctor of Philosophy&quot; with a 28-page dissertation entitled &quot;Personal Observations of Damavand&quot;. This dissertation is a summary of one part of his book, &quot;King Oscar&#x27;s Legation to the Shah of Persia in 1890&quot;. Eric Wennerholm remarked on the subject: 
I can only come to the conclusion that Sven [Hedin] received his doctorate when he was 27 years old after studying for a grand total of only eight months and collecting primary material for one-and-a-half days on the snow-clad peak of Mount Damavand.
Ferdinand Freiherr von Richthofen not only encouraged Hedin to absolve cursory studies, but also to become thoroughly acquainted with all branches of geographic science and the methodologies of the salient research work, so that he could later work as an explorer. Hedin abstained from doing this with an explanation he supplied in old age: 
I was not up to this challenge. I had gotten out onto the wild routes of Asia too early, I had perceived too much of the splendor and magnificence of the Orient, the silence of the deserts and the loneliness of long journeys. I could not get used to the idea of spending a long period of time back in school.
Hedin had therewith decided to become an explorer. He was attracted to the idea of traveling to the last mysterious portions of Asia and filling in the gaps by mapping an area completely unknown in Europe. As an explorer, Hedin became important for the Asian and European powers, who courted him, invited him to give numerous lectures, and hoped to obtain from him in return topographic, economic and strategic information about inner Asia, which they considered part of their sphere of influence. As the era of discovery came to a close around 1920, Hedin contented himself with organizing the Sino-Swedish Expedition for qualified scientific explorers.

===First expedition===
Between 1893 and 1897, Hedin investigated the Pamir Mountains, travelling through the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang region, across the Taklamakan Desert, Lake Kara-Koshun and Lake Bosten, proceeding to study northern Tibet. He covered on this journey and mapped of them on 552 sheets. Approximately led through previously uncharted areas.

He started out on this expedition on 16 October 1893, from Stockholm, traveling via Saint Petersburg and Tashkent to the Pamir Mountains. Several attempts to climb the high Muztagata—called the Father of the Glaciers—in the Pamir Mountains were unsuccessful. He remained in Kashgar until April 1895 and then left on 10 April with three local escorts from the village of Merket to cross the Taklamakan Desert via Tusluk to the Khotan River. Since their water supply was insufficient, seven camels died of thirst, as did two of his escorts (according to Hedin&#x27;s dramatized and probably inaccurate account). Bruno Baumann traveled on this route in April 2000 with a camel caravan and ascertained that at least one of the escorts who, according to Hedin, had died of thirst had survived, and that it is impossible for a camel caravan traveling in springtime on this route to carry enough drinking water for both camels and travelers.

According to other sources, Hedin had neglected to completely fill the drinking water containers for his caravan at the beginning of the expedition and set out for the desert with only half as much water as could actually be carried. When he noticed the mistake, it was too late to return. Obsessed by his urge to carry out his research, Hedin deserted the caravan and proceeded alone on horseback with his servant. When that escort also collapsed from thirst, Hedin left him behind as well, but managed to reach a water source at the last desperate moment. He did, however, return to his servant with water and rescued him. Nevertheless, his ruthless behavior earned him massive criticism.

In January 1896, after a stopover in Kashgar, Hedin visited the 1,500-year-old abandoned cities of Dandan Oilik and Kara Dung, which are located northeast of Khotan in the Taklamakan Desert. At the beginning of March, he discovered Lake Bosten, one of the largest inland bodies of water in Central Asia. He reported that this lake is supplied by a single mighty feeder stream, the Kaidu River. He mapped Lake Kara-Koshun and returned on 27 May to Khotan. On 29 June, he started out from there with his caravan across northern Tibet and China to Beijing, where he arrived on 2 March 1897. He returned to Stockholm via Mongolia and Russia.

===Second expedition===
Another expedition in Central Asia followed in 1899–1902 through the Tarim Basin, Tibet and Kashmir to Calcutta. Hedin navigated the Yarkand, Tarim and Kaidu rivers and found the dry riverbed of the Kum-darja as well as the dried out lake bed of Lop Nur. Near Lop Nur, he discovered the ruins of the former walled royal city and later Chinese garrison town of Loulan, containing the brick building of the Imperial Chinese Army commander, a stupa, and 19 dwellings built of poplar wood. He also found a wooden wheel from a horse-drawn cart (called an arabas) as well as several hundred documents written on wood, paper and silk in the Kharosthi script. These provided information about the history of the city of Loulan, which had once been located on the shores of Lop Nur but had been abandoned around the year 330 CE because the lake had dried out, depriving the inhabitants of drinking water.

During his travels in 1900 and 1901 he attempted in vain to reach the city of Lhasa, which was forbidden to Europeans. He continued to Leh, in Ladakh district, India. From Leh, Hedin&#x27;s route took him to Lahore, Delhi, Agra, Lucknow, Benares to Calcutta, meeting there with George Nathaniel Curzon, England&#x27;s then Viceroy to India.

This expedition resulted in 1,149 pages of maps, on which Hedin depicted newly discovered lands. He was the first to describe yardang formations in the Lop Desert.

===Third expedition===
Between 1905 and 1908, Hedin investigated the Central Iranian desert basins, the western highlands of Tibet and the Transhimalaya, which for a time was afterward called the Hedin Range. He visited the 9th Panchen Lama in the cloistered city of Tashilhunpo in Shigatse. Hedin was the first European to reach the Kailash region, including the sacred Lake Manasarovar and Mount Kailash, the midpoint of the earth according to Buddhist and Hindu mythology. The most important goal of the expedition was the search for the sources of the Indus and Brahmaputra Rivers, both of which Hedin found. From India, he returned via Japan and Russia to Stockholm.

He returned from this expedition with a collection of geological samples which are kept and studied in the Bavarian State Collection of Paleontology and Geology of Munich University. These sedimentary rocks—such as breccia, conglomerate, limestone, and slate, as well as volcanic rock and granite—highlight the geological diversity of the regions visited by Hedin during this expedition.

===Mongolia===
In 1923, Hedin traveled to Beijing via the United States—where he visited the Grand Canyon—and the Empire of Japan. Because of political and social unrest in China, he had to abandon an expedition to Xinjiang. Instead, he traveled with Frans August Larson (called the &quot;Duke of Mongolia&quot;) in November and December in a Dodge automobile from Peking through Mongolia via Ulaanbaatar to Ulan-Ude, Russia and from there on the Trans-Siberian Railway to Moscow.

===Fourth expedition===
Between 1927 and 1935, Hedin led an international Sino-Swedish Expedition which investigated the meteorological, topographic and prehistoric situation in Mongolia, the Gobi Desert and Xinjiang.

Hedin described it as a peripatetic university in which the participating scientists worked almost independently, while he—like a local manager—negotiated with local authorities, made decisions, organized whatever was necessary, raised funds and recorded the route followed. He gave archaeologists, astronomers, botanists, geographers, geologists, meteorologists and zoologists from Sweden, Germany and China an opportunity to participate in the expedition and carry out research in their areas of specialty.

Hedin met Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, who thereupon became a patron of the expedition. The Sino-Swedish Expedition was honored with a Chinese postage stamp series which had a print run of 25,000. The four stamps show camels at a camp with the expedition flag and bear the Chinese text, &quot;Postal Service of the Prosperous Middle Kingdom&quot; and in Latin underneath, &quot;Scientific Expedition to the Northwestern Province of China 1927–1933&quot;. A painting in the Beijing Palace Museum entitled &quot;Nomads in the Desert&quot; served as model for the series. Of the 25,000 sets, 4,000 were sold across the counter and 21,500 came into the possession of the expedition. Hedin used them to finance the expedition, selling them for a price of five dollars per set. The stamps were unwelcome at the time due to the high price Hedin was selling them at, but years later became valuable treasures among collectors.

The first part of the expedition, from 1927 to 1932, led from Beijing via Baotou to Mongolia, over the Gobi Desert, through Xinjiang to Ürümqi, and into the northern and eastern parts of the Tarim Basin. The expedition had a wealth of scientific results which are being published up to the present time. For example, the discovery of specific deposits of iron, manganese, oil, coal and gold reserves was of great economic relevance for China. In recognition of his achievements, the Berlin Geographical Society presented him with the &quot;Ferdinand von Richthofen Medal&quot; in 1933; the same honor was also awarded to Erich von Drygalski for his Gauss Expedition to the Antarctic; and to Alfred Philippson for his research on the Aegean Region.

From the end of 1933 to 1934, Hedin led—on behalf of the Kuomintang government under Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing—a Chinese expedition to investigate irrigation measures and draw up plans and maps for the construction of two roads suitable for automobiles along the Silk Road from Beijing to Xinjiang. Following his plans, major irrigation facilities were constructed, settlements erected, and roads built on the Silk Road from Beijing to Kashgar, which made it possible to completely bypass the rough terrain of Tarim Basin.
One aspect of the geography of central Asia which intensively occupied Hedin for decades was what he called the &quot;wandering lake&quot; Lop Nur. In May 1934, he began a river expedition to this lake. For two months he navigated the Kaidu River and the Kum-Darja to Lop Nur, which had been filled with water since 1921. After the lake dried out in 1971 as a consequence of irrigation activities, the above-mentioned transportation link enabled the People&#x27;s Republic of China to construct a nuclear weapon test site at Lop Nur.

His caravan of truck lorries was hijacked by the Chinese Muslim General Ma Zhongying who was retreating from northern Xinjiang along with his Kuomintang 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) from the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang. While Hedin was detained by Ma Zhongying, he met General Ma Hushan, and Kemal Kaya Effendi.

Ma Zhongying&#x27;s adjutant claimed to Hedin that Ma Zhongying had the entire region of Tian-shan-nan-lu (southern Xinjiang) under his control and Sven could pass through safely without any trouble. Hedin did not believe his assertions. Some of Ma Zhongying&#x27;s Tungan (Chinese speaking Muslim) troops attacked Hedin&#x27;s expedition by shooting at their vehicles.

For the return trip, Hedin selected the southern Silk Road route via Hotan to Xi&#x27;an, where the expedition arrived on 7 February 1935. He continued on to Beijing to meet with President Lin Sen and to Nanjing to Chiang Kai-shek. He celebrated his 70th birthday on 19 February 1935 in the presence of 250 members of the Kuomintang government, to whom he reported interesting facts about the Sino-Swedish Expedition. On this day, he was awarded the Brilliant Jade Order, Second Class.

At the end of the expedition, Hedin was in a difficult financial situation. He had considerable debts at the German-Asian Bank in Beijing, which he repaid with the royalties and fees received for his books and lectures. In the months after his return, he held 111 lectures in 91 German cities as well as 19 lectures in neighboring countries. To accomplish this lecture tour, he covered a stretch as long as the equator, by train and by car—in a time period of five months. He met Adolf Hitler in Berlin before his lecture on 14 April 1935.

==Political views==
Hedin was a monarchist. From 1905 onwards he took a stand against the move toward democracy in his Swedish homeland. He warned of the dangers he assumed to be coming from Czarist Russia, and called for an alliance with the German Empire. Therefore, he advocated a strengthened national defence, with a vigilant military preparedness. August Strindberg was one of his opponents on this issue, which divided Swedish politics at the time. In 1912 Hedin publicly supported the &quot;Swedish coastal defense ship Society&quot;. He helped collect public donations for the building of the coastal defense ship , which the Liberal and anti-militarist government of Karl Staaff had been unwilling to finance. In early 1914, when the Liberal government enacted cutbacks to the country&#x27;s defenses, Hedin wrote the Courtyard Speech, in which King Gustaf V promised to strengthen the country&#x27;s defenses. The speech led to a political crisis that ended with Staaff and his government resigning and being replaced by a non-party, more conservative government.

He developed a lasting affinity for the German empire, with which he became acquainted during his formal studies. This is also shown in his admiration for Kaiser Wilhelm II, whom he even visited in exile in the Netherlands. Influenced by imperial Russian and later the Soviet union&#x27;s attempts to dominate and control territories outside its borders, especially in Central Asia and Turkestan, Hedin felt that Soviet Russia posed a great threat to the West, which may be part of the reason why he supported Germany during both World Wars.

He viewed World War I as a struggle of the German race (particularly against Russia) and took sides in books like &quot;Ein Volk in Waffen. Den deutschen Soldaten gewidmet&quot; (A People in Arms. Dedicated to the German Soldier). As a consequence, he lost friends in France and England and was expelled from the British Royal Geographical Society, and from the Imperial Russian Geographical Society. Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I and the associated loss of its international reputation affected him deeply. That Sweden gave asylum to Wolfgang Kapp as a political refugee after the failure of the Kapp Putsch is said to be primarily attributable to his efforts.

==Hedin and Nazi Germany==
Hedin&#x27;s conservative and pro-German views eventually translated into sympathy for the Third Reich, and this would draw him into increasing controversy towards the end of his life. Adolf Hitler had been an early admirer of Hedin, who was in turn impressed with Hitler&#x27;s nationalism. He saw the German leader&#x27;s rise to power as a revival of German fortunes, and welcomed its challenge against Soviet Communism. He was not an entirely uncritical supporter of the Nazis, however. His own views were shaped by traditionalist, Christian and conservative values, while National Socialism was in part a modern revolutionary-populist movement. Hedin objected to some aspects of National Socialist rule, and occasionally attempted to convince the German government to relent in its anti-religious and anti-Semitic campaigns.

Hedin met Adolf Hitler and other leading Nazi Party leaders repeatedly and was in regular correspondence with them. The politely-worded correspondence usually concerned scheduling matters, birthday congratulations, Hedin&#x27;s planned or completed publications, and requests by Hedin for pardons for people condemned to death, and for mercy, release and permission to leave the country for people interned in prisons or concentration camps. In correspondence with Joseph Goebbels and Hans Dräger, Hedin was able to achieve the printing of the &quot;Daily Watchwords&quot; year after year. Hedin directly interviewed Hitler in October 1939, one month after the invasion of Poland, where Hitler claimed that there could be peace if the United Kingdom and France recognized the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. 

On 29 October 1942, Hitler read Hedin&#x27;s book entitled, &quot;America in the Battle of the Continents&quot;. In the book Hedin promoted the view that President Franklin D. Roosevelt was responsible for the outbreak of war in 1939 and that Hitler had done everything in his power to prevent war. Moreover, Hedin argued that the origins of the Second World War lay not in German belligerence but in the Treaty of Versailles. This book deeply influenced Hitler and reaffirmed his views on the origins of the war and who was responsible for it. In a letter to Hedin the following day Hitler wrote, &quot;I thank you warmly for the attention you have shown me. I have already read the book and welcome in particular that you so explicitly detailed the offers I made to Poland at the beginning of the War&quot;. Hitler continued, &quot;without question, the individual guilty of this war, as you correctly state at the end of your book, is exclusively the American President Roosevelt.&quot;

The Nazis attempted to achieve a close connection to Hedin by bestowing awards upon him—later scholars have noted that &quot;honors were heaped upon this prominent sympathizer.&quot; They asked him to present an address on &quot;Sport as a Teacher&quot; at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin&#x27;s Olympic Stadium. They made him an honorary member of the &quot;German-Swedish Union Berlin&quot; () In 1938, they presented him with the City of Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Badge of Honor&quot; (). For his 75th birthday on 19 February 1940 they awarded him the Order of the German Eagle; shortly before that date it had been presented to Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1943 they released the Oslo professor of philology and university rector Didrik Arup Seip from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp at Hedin&#x27;s request to obtain Hedin&#x27;s agreement to accept additional honors during the 470th anniversary of Munich University. On 15 January 1943, he received the &quot;Gold Medal of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences&quot; (Goldmedaille der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften). On 16 January 1943 he received an honorary doctorate from the faculty of natural sciences of Munich University. On the same day, the Nazis founded in his absence the &quot;Sven Hedin Institute for Inner Asian Research&quot; located at Mittersill Castle, which was supposed to serve the long-term advancement of the scientific legacy of Hedin and Wilhelm Filchner as Asian experts. However, it was instead misused by Heinrich Himmler as an institute of the &quot;Research Association for German Genealogical Inheritance&quot; (Forschungsgemeinschaft Deutsches Ahnenerbe e.V.). On 21 January 1943, he was requested to sign the &quot;Golden Book of the city of Munich&quot;.

Hedin supported the Nazis in his journalistic activities. After the collapse of Nazi Germany, he did not regret his collaboration with the Nazis because this cooperation had made it possible to rescue numerous Nazi victims from execution, or death in extermination camps.

Senior Jewish German archeologist Werner Scheimberg, sent in the expedition by the Thule Society, &quot;had been one of the companions of the Swedish explorer Sven Hedin on his excursions in the East, with archaeological and to some extent esoteric purposes&quot;. 

Hedin was trying to discover the mythological place of Agartha and reproached the Polish explorer and visiting professor Antoni Ossendowski for having been gone where the Swedish explorer wasn&#x27;t able to come, and thus was personally invited by Adolf Hitler in Berlin and honoured by the Führer during his 75th birthday feast.

===Criticism of National Socialism===
Johannes Paul wrote in 1954 about Hedin:
Much of what happened in the early days of Nazi rule had his approval. However, he did not hesitate to criticize whenever he considered this to be necessary, particularly in cases of Jewish persecution, conflict with the churches and bars to freedom of science.
In 1937 Hedin refused to publish his book &quot;Deutschland und der Weltfrieden&quot; (Germany and World Peace) in Germany because the Reich Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda insisted on the deletion of Nazi-critical passages. In a letter Hedin wrote to State Secretary Walther Funk dated 16 April 1937, it becomes clear what his criticism of National Socialism was in this time before the establishment of extermination camps:
When we first discussed my plan to write a book, I stated that I only wanted to write objectively, scientifically, possibly critically, according to my conscience, and you considered that to be completely acceptable and natural. Now I emphasized in a very friendly and mild form that the removal of distinguished Jewish professors who have performed great services for mankind is detrimental to Germany and that this has given rise to many agitators against Germany abroad. So I took this position only in the interest of Germany.

My worry that the education of German youth, which I otherwise praise and admire everywhere, is deficient in questions of religion and the hereafter comes from my love and sympathy for the German nation, and as a Christian I consider it my duty to state this openly, and, to be sure, in the firm conviction that Luther’s nation, which is religious through and through, will understand me.

So far I have never gone against my conscience and will not do it now either. Therefore, no deletions will be made.
Hedin later published this book in Sweden.

===Efforts on behalf of deported Jews===
After he refused to remove his criticism of National Socialism from his book &quot;Deutschland und der Weltfrieden&quot;, the Nazis confiscated the passports of Hedin&#x27;s Jewish friend Alfred Philippson and his family in 1938 to prevent their intended departure to American exile and retain them in Germany as a bargaining chip when dealing with Hedin. The consequence was that Hedin expressed himself more favorably about Nazi Germany in his book &quot;Fünfzig Jahre Deutschland&quot;, subjugated himself against his conscience to the censorship of the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, and published the book in Germany.

On 8 June 1942, the Nazis increased the pressure on Hedin by deporting Alfred Philippson and his family to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. By doing so, they accomplished their goal of forcing Hedin against his conscience to write his book &quot;Amerika im Kampf der Kontinente&quot; in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda and other government agencies and to publish it in Germany in 1942. In return, the Nazis classified Alfred Philippson as &quot;A-prominent&quot; and granted his family privileges which enabled them to survive.

For a long time Hedin was in correspondence with Alfred Philippson and regularly sent food parcels to him in Theresienstadt concentration camp. On 29 May 1946, Alfred Philippson wrote to him (translation, abbreviated quotation): 
My dear Hedin! Now that letters can be sent abroad I have the opportunity to write to you…. We frequently think with deep gratitude of our rescuer, who alone is responsible for our being able to survive the horrible period of three years of incarceration and hunger in Theresienstadt concentration camp, at my age a veritable wonder. You will have learned that we few survivors were finally liberated just a few days before our intended gassing. We, my wife, daughter and I, were then brought on 9–10 July 1945 in a bus of the city of Bonn here to our home town, almost half of which is now destroyed….
Hedin responded on 19 July 1946 (translation, abbreviated quotation): 
…It was wonderful to find out that our efforts were not in vain. In these difficult years we attempted to rescue over one hundred other unfortunate people who had been deported to Poland, but in most cases without success. We were however able to help a few Norwegians. My home in Stockholm was turned into something like an information and assistance office, and I was excellently supported by Dr. Paul Grassmann, press attaché in the German embassy in Stockholm. He too undertook everything possible to further this humanitarian work. But almost no case was as fortunate as yours, dear friend! And how wonderful, that you are back in Bonn….
The names and fates of the over one hundred deported Jews whom Hedin tried to save have not yet been researched.

===Efforts on behalf of deported Norwegians===
Hedin supported the cause of the Norwegian author Arnulf Øverland and for the Oslo professor of philology and university director Didrik Arup Seip, who were interned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. He achieved the release of Didrik Arup Seip, but his efforts to free Arnulf Øverland were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, Arnulf Øverland survived the concentration camp.

===Efforts on behalf of Norwegian activists===
After the third senate of the highest German military court (Reichskriegsgericht) in Berlin condemned to death for alleged espionage the ten Norwegians Sigurd Jakobsen, Gunnar Hellesen, Helge Børseth, Siegmund Brommeland, Peter Andree Hjelmervik, Siegmund Rasmussen, Gunnar Carlsen, Knud Gjerstad, Christian Oftedahl and Frithiof Lund on 24 February 1941, Hedin successfully appealed via Colonel General Nikolaus von Falkenhorst to Adolf Hitler for their reprieve. Their death sentences were converted on 17 June 1941 by Adolf Hitler to ten years of forced labor. The Norwegians Carl W. Mueller, Knud Naerum, Peder Fagerland, Ottar Ryan, Tor Gerrard Rydland, Hans Bernhard Risanger and Arne Sørvag who had been condemned to forced labor under the same charge received reduced sentences at Hedin&#x27;s request. Unfortunately, Hans Bernhard Risanger died in prison just a few days before his release.

Falkenhorst was sentenced by a joint British-Norwegian military tribunal to be executed by firing squad on 2 August 1946 due to his role in the summary execution of British prisoners of war during Operation Freshman. Hedin intervened on his behalf on 4 December 1946, arguing that Falkenhorst had likewise striven to pardon the ten Norwegians condemned to death. Falkenhorst&#x27;s death sentence was commuted to 20 years in prison. He was released early from Werl Prison on 13 July 1953.

==Awards==
Because of his outstanding services, Hedin was raised to the untitled nobility by King Oskar II in 1902, the last time any Swede was to receive a charter of nobility. Oskar II suggested that he prefix the name Hedin with one of the two common predicates of nobility in Sweden, &quot;af&quot; or &quot;von&quot;, but Hedin abstained from doing so in his written response to the king. In many noble families in Sweden, it was customary to do without the title of nobility. The coat of arms of Hedin, together with those of some two thousand noble families, is to be found on a wall of the Great Hall in Riddarhuset, the assembly house of Swedish nobility in Stockholm&#x27;s inner city, Gamla Stan.

In 1905, Hedin was admitted to membership in the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and in 1909 to the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences. From 1913 to 1952 he held the sixth of 18 chairs as an elected member of the Swedish Academy. In this position, he had a vote in the selection of Nobel Prize winners.

He was an honorary member of numerous Swedish and foreign scientific societies and institutions which honored him with some 40 gold medals; 27 of these medals can be viewed in Stockholm in a display case in the Royal Coin Cabinet.

He received honorary doctorates from Oxford (1909), Cambridge (1909), Heidelberg (1928), Uppsala (1935), and Munich (1943) universities and from the Handelshochschule Berlin (1931) (all Dr. phil. h.c.), from Breslau University (1915, Dr. jur. h.c.), and from Rostock University (1919, Dr. med. h.c.).

Numerous countries presented him with medals. In Sweden he became a Commander 1st Class of the Royal Order of the North Star (KNO1kl) with a brilliant badge and Knight of the Royal Order of Vasa (RVO). In the United Kingdom he was named Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire by King Edward VII. As a foreigner, he was not authorized to use the associated title of Sir, but he could place the designation KCIE after his family name Hedin. Hedin was also a Grand Cross of the Order of the German Eagle.

In his honor have been named a glacier, the Sven Hedin Glacier; a lunar crater Hedin; a genus of flowering plants, &quot;Hedinia&quot;; a species of the flowering plant, &quot;Gentiana hedini&quot; (now a synonym of &quot;Comastoma falcatum&quot; ); the beetles &quot;Longitarsus hedini&quot; and &quot;Coleoptera hedini&quot;; a butterfly, &quot;Fumea hedini Caradja&quot;; a spider, &quot;Dictyna hedini&quot;; a fossil hoofed mammal, &quot;Tsaidamotherium hedini&quot;; a fossil Therapsid (a &quot;mammal-like reptile&quot;) &quot;Lystrosaurus hedini&quot;; and streets and squares in the cities of various countries (for example, &quot;Hedinsgatan&quot; at Tessinparken in Stockholm).

A permanent exhibition of articles found by Hedin on his expeditions is located in the Stockholm Ethnographic Museum.

In the Adolf Frederick church can be found the Sven Hedin memorial plaque by Liss Eriksson. The plaque was installed in 1959. On it, a globe with Asia to the fore can be seen, crowned with a camel. It bears the Swedish epitaph: 

The Sven Hedin Firn in North Greenland was named after him.

==Research on Hedin==
===Source material===
A survey of the extensive sources for Hedin research shows that it would be difficult at present to come to a fair assessment of the personality and achievements of Hedin. Most of the source material has not yet been subjected to scientific scrutiny. Even the DFG project &quot;Sven Hedin und die deutsche Geographie&quot; had to restrict itself to a small selection and a random examination of the source material.

The sources for Hedin research are located in numerous archives (and include primary literature, correspondence, newspaper articles, obituaries and secondary literature).

* Hedin&#x27;s own publications amount to some 30,000 pages.
* There are about 2,500 drawings and watercolors, films and many photographs.
* To this should be added 25 volumes with travel and expedition notes and 145 volumes of the diaries he regularly maintained between 1930 and 1952, totaling 8,257 pages.
* The extensive holdings of the Hedin Foundation (Sven Hedins Stiftelse), which holds Hedin effects in trust, are to be found in the Ethnographic Museum and in the National Archives in Stockholm.
* Hedin&#x27;s correspondence is in the archive of the German Foreign Office in Bonn, in the German Federal Archives in Koblenz, at the Leibniz Institute for Regional Geography in Leipzig, and above all in the Ethnographic Museum and in the National Archives in Stockholm. Most of the correspondence in Hedin&#x27;s estate is in the National Archives and accessible to researchers and the general public. It includes about 50,000 letters organized alphabetically according to country and sender as well as some 30,000 additional unsorted letters.
* The scientific effects as well as a collection of newspaper articles about Hedin organized by year (1895–1952) in 60 bound folios can be found in the Ethnographic Museum.
* The finds from Tibet, Mongolia and Xinjiang are, among other places, in Stockholm in the Ethnographic Museum (some 8,000 individual items), in the Institutes of Geology, Minearology and Paleontology of the Uppsala University, in the depots of the Bavarian State Collection of Paleontology and Geology in Munich, and in the National Museum of China, Beijing.

===Hedin&#x27;s documentation===
During his expeditions Hedin saw the focus of his work as being in field research. He recorded routes by plotting many thousands of kilometers of his caravan itinerary with the detail of a high resolution topographical map and supplemented them with innumerable altitude measurements and latitude and longitude data. At the same time he combined his field maps with panoramic drawings. He drafted the first precise maps of areas unresearched until that date: the Pamir mountains, the Taklamakan desert, Tibet, the Silk Road and the Himalayas. He was, as far as can be scientifically confirmed, the first European to recognize that the Himalayas were a continuous mountain range.

He systematically studied the lakes of inner Asia, made careful climatological observations over many years, and started extensive collections of rocks, plants, animals and antiquities. Underway he prepared watercolor paintings, sketches, drawings and photographs, which he later published in his works. The photographs and maps with the highest quality printing are to be found in the original Swedish publications.

Hedin prepared a scientific publication for each of his expeditions. The extent of documentation increased dramatically from expedition to expedition. His research report about the first expedition was published in 1900 as &quot;Die geographisch-wissenschaftlichen Ergebnisse meiner Reisen in Zentralasien 1894–97&quot; (Supplement 28 to &quot;Petermanns Mitteilungen&quot;), Gotha 1900. The publication about the second expedition, &quot;Scientific Results of a Journey in Central Asia&quot;, increased to six text and two atlas volumes. &quot;Southern Tibet&quot;, the scientific publication on the third expedition, totalled twelve volumes, three of which were atlases. The results of the Sino-Swedish Expedition were published under the title of &quot;Reports from the scientific expedition to the north-western provinces of China under leadership of Dr. Sven Hedin. The sino-Swedish expedition&quot;. This publication went through 49 editions.

This documentation was splendidly produced, which made the price so high that only a few libraries and institutes were able to purchase it. The immense printing costs had to be borne for the most part by Hedin himself, as was also true for the cost of the expeditions. He used the fees and royalties which he received from his popular science books and for his lectures for the purpose.

Hedin did not himself subject his documentation to scientific evaluation, but rather handed it over to other scientists for the purpose. Since he shared his experiences during his expeditions as popular science and incorporated them in a large number of lectures, travelogues, books for young people and adventure books, he became known to the general public. He soon became famous as one of the most well-recognized personalities of his time.

D. Henze wrote the following about an exhibition at the Deutsches Museum entitled &quot;Sven Hedin, the last explorer&quot;: 
He was a pioneer and pathfinder in the transitional period to a century of specialized research. No other single person illuminated and represented unknown territories more extensively than he. His maps alone are a unique creation. And the artist did not take second place to the savant, who deep in the night rapidly and apparently without effort rapidly created awe inspiring works. The discipline of geography, at least in Germany, has so far only concerned itself with his popularized reports. The consistent inclusion of the enormous, still unmined treasures in his scientific work are yet to be incorporated in the regional geography of Asia.
===Current Hedin research===
A scientific assessment of Hedin&#x27;s character and his relationship to National Socialism was undertaken in the late 1990s and early 2000s at Bonn University by Professor Hans Böhm, Dipl.-Geogr. Astrid Mehmel and Christoph Sieker M.A. as part of the DFG Project &quot;Sven Hedin und die deutsche Geographie&quot; (&quot;Sven Hedin and German Geography&quot;).

Most German publications on Hedin were translated by F.A. Brockhaus Verlag from Swedish into German. To this extent Swedish editions are the original text. Often after the first edition appeared, F.A. Brockhaus Verlag published abridged versions with the same title. Hedin had not only an important business relationship with the publisher Albert Brockhaus, but also a close friendship. Their correspondence can be found in the Riksarkivet in Stockholm. There is a publication on this subject:

* Sven Hedin, Albert Brockhaus: &quot;Sven Hedin und Albert Brockhaus. Eine Freundschaft in Briefen zwischen Autor und Verleger&quot;. F. A. Brockhaus, Leipzig 1942.

<doc id="529136" wikidata="Q314415" url="?curid=529136" title="Chris Webber">
<text>Mayce Edward Christopher Webber III (born March 1, 1973), nicknamed &quot;C-Web&quot;, is an American former professional basketball player. Webber played 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), with the largest portion of his career spent with the Sacramento Kings. Drafted number one overall in the 1993 NBA draft, Webber became a 5-time NBA All-Star, a 5-time All-NBA Team member, and the NBA Rookie of the Year. He also played for the Golden State Warriors, Washington Bullets, Philadelphia 76ers, and Detroit Pistons during his NBA career.

Webber was a former National High School Basketball Player of the Year who led his high school to three Michigan State High School Basketball Championships. As a collegiate athlete, he was a first-team All-American and led the Michigan Wolverines&#x27; 1991 incoming freshman class known as the Fab Five that reached the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship games as freshmen and sophomores. However, Webber was indicted by a federal grand jury and stripped of his All-American honors by the NCAA as a result of his direct involvement in a scandal involving payments from boosters to players.

Webber is an on-air commentator for NBA games and has taught at Wake Forest University and Morehouse College. He was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021.

==High school career==
Webber attended Detroit Country Day School from 1987 to 1991 and at the time was the most recruited Michigan high school basketball player since Magic Johnson. Webber led Country Day to three MHSAA State championships. As a senior in high school Webber averaged 29.4 points and 13 rebounds per game. He was named Mr. Basketball of Michigan and the 1990–1991 National High School player of the year. He was named MVP in both the McDonald&#x27;s and Dapper Dan All-Star games.

==College career==
After graduating from Detroit Country Day School, Webber attended the University of Michigan for two years. While a Michigan Wolverine, Webber led the group of players known as the Fab Five, which included himself, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson. This group, all of whom entered Michigan as freshmen in the fall of 1991, took the basketball team to the NCAA finals twice, losing both times. The Fab Five, sporting long, baggy shorts and black socks, became immensely popular as they were seen as bringing a hip hop flavor to the game. Four of the Fab Five (Webber, Rose, Howard, and King) made it to the NBA. In their first season, the Fab Five led Michigan to an NCAA championship game against Duke, becoming the first team in NCAA history to compete in the championship with freshmen as all five starters.

On April 5, 1993, at Michigan&#x27;s second consecutive appearance at the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship game with 11 seconds remaining, Webber brought the ball up the court into a half court trap. Michigan was down 73–71. Webber attempted to call for a timeout while his team had none remaining, resulting in a technical foul that effectively clinched the game for North Carolina. Webber continues to receive ridicule for his time-out error; when he joined &quot;Inside the NBA&quot; in 2008, part of the humorous initiation ceremony was the question &quot;In college basketball how many timeouts do you get in a game?&quot; (Webber replied, &quot;I still don&#x27;t know the answer!&quot;) His father has a license plate that says timeout. The error was later referenced in the 2018 sports comedy film &quot;Uncle Drew&quot;, in which Webber played the role of Preacher.

The game marked the end of Webber&#x27;s acclaimed two-year collegiate basketball career. In his second season, he was a first team All-American selection and a finalist for the John R. Wooden Award and Naismith College Player of the Year. These awards and honors have been vacated due to University of Michigan and NCAA sanctions related to the University of Michigan basketball scandal. In that scandal, Webber received over $200,000 from a local booster while playing basketball for Michigan. Webber was convicted of perjury and banned from any affiliation with the Michigan program until 2013.

Despite the ban, Webber attended the 2013 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship game between Michigan and Louisville. He apparently watched the game from a private suite, rather than in the grandstands near courtside, where the other members of the Fab Five watched the game together. Webber posted on Twitter before the game: &quot;I&#x27;m here at the Georgia Dome to show my support for the Michigan men&#x27;s basketball team in its quest for a National Championship. I&#x27;ve known some of the players on the team since they were kids and I am excited for them and all of the student athletes on the court tonight who are wearing the Michigan uniform. It has been a great season and I wish them all the best.&quot;

===University of Michigan basketball scandal===

In 2002, Webber was charged for lying to a grand jury as part of a larger investigation of a numbers gambling operation, run by Michigan basketball program booster Ed Martin, in Ford Motor Company plants in the Detroit area. The investigation, originally focused on the numbers operation and tax evasion, soon widened to include the University of Michigan basketball program. Martin was convicted on counts of tax evasion and robbery and was scheduled to testify on the financial connections between himself and Webber at a sentencing hearing, but died of a heart attack before the hearing.

As a result of evidence admitted during the course of Martin&#x27;s trial, Webber pleaded guilty to one count of criminal contempt for lying about his role in a scandal in which four players, including himself, had accepted illicit loans from Martin. Martin had been giving money to Webber since the 8th grade. He admitted in the plea that in 1994 he gave Martin about $38,000 in cash as partial repayment for expenditures Martin made on his behalf. He was ordered to pay $100,000 and perform 330 hours of community service.

Due to concerns that Webber&#x27;s amateur status had been compromised, Michigan forfeited its victory in the 1992 Final Four over Cincinnati, as well as its runner-up status in the 1992 tourney. Michigan also forfeited the entire 1992–93 season, removed the 1992 and 1993 Final Four banners from the Crisler Arena rafters, and deleted Webber&#x27;s records from its record book. The NCAA also ordered Michigan to disassociate itself from Webber until 2013. Webber later called Michigan&#x27;s decision &quot;hurtful&quot; because he and his Fab Five teammates &quot;gave everything to Michigan&quot; while they played there.

After Webber&#x27;s plea, the Michigan State High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) recommended that Detroit Country Day forfeit all games in which Webber appeared (including three state championships), since according to his own admission, Webber had been accepting money from Martin since junior high school. The school conducted its own investigation, and called a press conference to announce it had found &quot;no credible evidence&quot; that Webber had accepted &quot;substantial&quot; amounts of cash from Martin while in high school, and therefore refused to forfeit any games. The MHSAA claimed it had no legal authority to force the games to be forfeited.

Webber was suspended by the NBA for a total of eight games—five for an unnamed violation of the league substance abuse policies and three for lying to the grand jury. Webber received the suspensions once he recovered from an injury that kept him out for half of the 2003–04 season.

The scandal was explored in a documentary by ESPN Films called &quot;The Fab Five&quot;, which aired in March 2011. In it, the University of Michigan repeated its position that it would not associate with Webber until he publicly apologized for his part in the Ed Martin scandal, with the self-imposed 10-year ban on its association with the remainder of the players ending in 2013. Webber declined to participate in the documentary.

Webber made his first post-ban public appearance at the University of Michigan on November 3, 2018, when he was invited by football coach Jim Harbaugh to participate as an honorary captain for its game against Penn State; Webber was warmly received at Michigan Stadium. Of the experience, Webber said on NBA TV, &quot;Tell you what, fellas, this was a great moment, in front of 100,000 people. I had goosebumps and chills, and definitely some watery eyes.&quot; Webber also spent time with the football program as its guest before the game. He did not meet with the Michigan basketball team or staff, but despite this, head coach John Beilein stated that &quot;I think it was a great step in the right direction that he was here.&quot; After Juwan Howard, teammate of Webber from the Fab Five, took over as head coach in 2019, Webber indicated to TMZ that he is open to reconciling with Michigan basketball and said, &quot;Howard is my friend... and therefore, I put pride aside&quot;, but wants his return to the Crisler Arena to be private.

==Professional career==

=== Golden State Warriors (1993–1994) ===
Webber was selected by the Orlando Magic with the first pick of the 1993 NBA draft, becoming the first sophomore since Magic Johnson to be a #1 overall draft pick. The Magic immediately traded him to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Penny Hardaway and three future first round draft picks. Over his 15-year NBA career, Webber made $178 million.

Webber had an outstanding first year, averaging 17.5 points and 9.1 rebounds per game and winning the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. He was instrumental in leading the Warriors back into the playoffs where they were swept by the Charles Barkley-led Phoenix Suns in three games. However, he had a long-standing conflict with his coach, Don Nelson. Nelson wanted to make Webber primarily a post player, despite Webber&#x27;s superb passing ability and good ball handling skills for someone his size at tall. Webber also disliked playing a substantial amount of time at center, given Nelson&#x27;s propensity towards smaller, faster line ups. In the 1994 off-season, the Warriors acquired Rony Seikaly so that Webber could play primarily at power forward. However, at the time, the differences between Webber and Nelson were considered to be irreconcilable. Webber exercised a one-year escape clause in his contract, stating he had no intention of returning to the Warriors. With few alternatives, Golden State agreed to a sign-and-trade deal, sending Webber to the Washington Bullets (renamed the Wizards in 1997) for forward Tom Gugliotta and three first-round draft picks. The three draft picks included two of the picks the Warriors had traded to the Magic to obtain Webber in the first place, as the Magic had included those picks in a trade package with the Bullets less than 4 months earlier.

=== Washington Bullets / Wizards (1994–1998) ===
With the Washington Bullets, Webber was reunited with his college teammate and friend, Juwan Howard. He spent the next three years with the Bullets (later renamed the Washington Wizards), although in the 1995–96 season injuries limited him to only 15 games. Webber rebounded the following year and was named to his first All-Star team in 1997. The same season, Webber led the Bullets into the playoffs for the first time in nine years, but they were swept by the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls in three games. By 1998, Webber had established himself as a great power forward, but his time in Washington had also worn out.

=== Sacramento Kings (1998–2005) ===

On May 14, 1998, Webber was traded to the Sacramento Kings for Mitch Richmond and Otis Thorpe. Although Webber originally did not want to go to the Kings, as they were a perennially losing team, he had his best years in Sacramento and nearly took the team to the NBA Finals.

When Webber arrived, the Kings also signed small forward Peja Stojaković and center Vlade Divac, and drafted point guard Jason Williams. In his first year with the Kings (the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season), Webber won the rebounding title averaging a league high 13.0 rebounds per game, ending Dennis Rodman&#x27;s seven-year run as the NBA&#x27;s rebound leader. Under the guidance of Rick Adelman, the Kings team made it into the 1999 Playoffs, where they lost to the Utah Jazz led by future hall of famers Karl Malone and John Stockton.

In years to come, Webber and the Kings became one of the league&#x27;s top franchises, and NBA title contenders. He was named to the All-Star team again in 2000 and 2001 while cementing his status as one of the premier power forwards in the NBA. For the 1999–2000 season Webber was the cover athlete on &quot;NBA Jam 2000&quot;; that season, Webber led the Kings to 44 wins improving their win column from a year before, and into the first round of the 2000 Playoffs where they faced the Los Angeles Lakers. After losing the first two games of the series in Los Angeles, the Kings won the next two in Sacramento, including 23 points, 14 rebounds, 7 blocks, 8 assists and 4 steals from Webber in game four, to send the series back to Los Angeles for a deciding game 5. The Kings lost Game 5 and the series to the Lakers who went on to win the championship that year.

Webber peaked in the 2000–01 season, when he averaged a career-high 27.1 points. He also averaged 11.1 rebounds and was fourth in MVP voting, while starting at forward for the Western Conference All-Star Team in the 2001 All-Star Game in Washington. In the 2001 Playoffs, Webber and the Kings defeated the Phoenix Suns in four games of the first round to advance to the second round (first time of his career he advanced past the first round), where they faced the Los Angeles Lakers for a second year in a row. The Kings lost in four games to the Lakers despite Webber&#x27;s 21 points, 11 rebounds and 8 assists in game four.

On July 27, 2001, Webber signed a seven-year, $127 million contract with the Kings. In the 2001–02 season, Webber played in 54 games leading the Kings to a Pacific division title and a franchise-record (and league-best) 61–21 season. He also made his fourth All-Star team and the All-NBA Second Team. In the 2002 Playoffs the Kings defeated the Utah Jazz in four games and Dallas Mavericks in five games in the first two rounds en route to reaching the Western Conference Finals against their archrivals, the defending-champion Los Angeles Lakers led by Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, a series that would prove to be one of the most memorable (and most controversial) in NBA History. 

The series was nip and tuck all the way as both teams traded wins in the first six games of the series as the Lakers won games one, four (highlighted by the game winner from Robert Horry) and six, a game which featured many controversial calls, including a late-game foul on Mike Bibby after he was bleeding from being elbowed in the nose by Bryant. All told, the Lakers shot 27 free throws in the fourth quarter. Former NBA referee Tim Donaghy filed in court papers in 2008 said that Game 6 was fixed by the NBA. NBA Commissioner David Stern denied Donaghy&#x27;s allegations. Lawrence Pedowitz, who led a review of the league&#x27;s officiating following the outbreak of the scandal, concluded that while Game 6 was poorly officiated, no concrete evidence existed of it having been fixed. 

The Kings won games two, three and five, including 29 points, 13 rebounds and 3 assists from Webber plus the game-winner from teammate Mike Bibby in game five, heading into the deciding seventh game back at the ARCO Arena in Sacramento, a game which would prove to be most memorable of the series. The game was nip and tuck all the way with Webber recording 20 points, 11 assists, 8 rebounds, 2 blocks and 1 steal and Bryant and O&#x27;Neal recording 30 points, 10 rebounds, 7 assists and 2 steals, with 35 points, 13 rebounds, 4 blocks and 2 assists, respectively, as the game went into overtime with missed shots from teammates Stojakovic and Doug Christie, boiling to the last minutes of the game with Webber fouling O&#x27;Neal with 1:27 left in overtime causing O&#x27;Neal to make both free throws and the Kings would go on to lose Game 7 of the series at home. It was the closest that Webber ever got to a championship.

In the next season, Webber averaged 23 points and 11 rebounds per game. He was cited as a possible MVP candidate, and made his fifth consecutive All-Star team. In a bad sign of what was to come, Webber missed the All Star game with a sprained ankle. Nevertheless, he returned and the Kings were among the favorites to win the NBA Championship. In the second game of the 2003 Western Conference Semifinals against the Dallas Mavericks, Webber suffered a career-threatening knee injury while making a back-cut, forcing him to miss nearly a year of action. This shattered the Kings&#x27; 2003 title hopes and they lost the series in seven games.

After microfracture surgery, he returned for the final 24 games of the 2003–04 season, in which he led the Kings (who went 55–27 that season) into the 2004 Playoffs where they faced their archrivals the Dallas Mavericks for the third year in a row, the Kings defeated the Mavericks in five games in the first round en route to reaching the Western Conference Semifinals against the top-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves led by league MVP Kevin Garnett, a series that would prove to be one of the most memorable in NBA history. Each game was neck and neck with both teams trading wins in the first six games of the series as the Timberwolves won games two, three and five, while the Kings won games one, four and six, including 28 points, 8 rebounds, 1 assist, 3 steals and 1 block from Webber in game four, heading into the deciding seventh game back at the Target Center in Minnesota, a game which would prove to be the most memorable of the series. 

The game was indecisively close throughout the first three quarters, with Webber recording 16 points, 8 rebounds, 4 assists and 1 steal, and Garnett on the other hand recording 32 points, 21 rebounds, 2 assists, 4 steals and 5 blocks. The game boiled down to the last play of the game with the Kings trailing the Timberwolves by 3 with 2.5 seconds left in the game. After receiving an inbounds pass Webber pump-faked Garnett in the air and got a clean look as Garnett avoided contact for a three-point shot that rimmed out as the final buzzer sounded and the Kings lost Game 7 and the series, marking the third year in a row that the Kings lost a deciding game 7. It turned out to be the last chance the Webber-led Kings had to win a championship and he was traded the following season, thus resulting in the team being dismantled the following season.

=== Philadelphia 76ers (2005–2007) ===
In February 2005, Webber was traded, along with Michael Bradley and Matt Barnes, to the Philadelphia 76ers for power forward Kenny Thomas, forward/center Brian Skinner, and former King Corliss Williamson. Webber took some time to fit in with the 76ers&#x27; system, which was geared toward star guard Allen Iverson. While the Sixers reached the 2005 playoffs, they lost to the Detroit Pistons. In the 21 games he played for Philadelphia in 2005, Webber averaged 15.6 points and 7.9 rebounds per game on 39.1% shooting. Following the 2003 microfracture surgery on his knee, Webber had lost lateral quickness and was seen as a defensive liability.

In 2006, Webber put up a resurgent 20 points and 9.9 rebounds per game in 75 games for Philadelphia. Nevertheless, the team missed the playoffs, finishing with a 38–44 record. On Tuesday, April 18, 2006, Webber and Iverson were fined for not showing up at the Philadelphia 76ers&#x27; final home game of the season, which was Fan Appreciation Night, although both of them were injured and not expected to play. The following day, they both apologized for being absent.

In the 2006–2007 season, Webber&#x27;s role was reduced, and he was benched in the fourth quarter of multiple games. In November 2006, ESPN reported that &quot;Webber&#x27;s minutes and production had &quot;dramatically declined&quot;, and that coach Maurice Cheeks had &quot;turned him into a $20 million role player&quot;. Webber discussed his frustration with team president Billy King, but claimed he was not requesting a trade. During the 2006–07 season, Webber only played 18 of 35 games for the Sixers, leading the media to question his motivation. On January 11, 2007, King announced that the Sixers and Webber had agreed to a reported $25 million contract buyout on the remaining two years left on his contract, in effect paying him not to play. Later that day, the Sixers waived Webber, making him a free agent.

===Detroit Pistons (2007)===
On January 16, 2007, Webber signed with the Detroit Pistons. He has stated throughout his career that he always wanted to play for his hometown team. His usual number 4 had been retired in honor of Joe Dumars, so Webber donned the number 84, because his nephew had a dream of him making a buzzer beater with that number on. The Pistons were a much improved basketball team after Webber&#x27;s acquisition, improving their record in the Eastern Conference and solidifying the first seed in the East. However, the Eastern Conference favorites failed to advance to the finals after losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games in the 
Eastern Conference Finals, leaving Webber short of an NBA Finals appearance yet again. Indeed, Webber performed well in the 2007 Playoffs despite receiving limited minutes. Webber still managed to average 10 points and 6 rebounds per game in the playoffs and shot an impressive 52.4% from the field. His efforts were highlighted by a game 5 performance in the Eastern Conference Finals in which Webber scored 20 points (including 5 points in the double-overtime period) on 9 of 13 shooting and grabbed 7 boards. Nevertheless, Detroit still lost what turned out to be the key game in the series in double overtime and Webber ended up averaging a career low 11.2 PPG in his run with the Pistons. During the off-season, Detroit did not re-sign Webber. Despite receiving a lucrative proposal from Olympiacos B.C. in Greece, he was in free agency at the beginning of the regular season.

=== Return to Golden State (2008) ===

On January 29, 2008, the Golden State Warriors signed Webber for the rest of the season. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that he would receive the pro-rated veteran&#x27;s minimum of $1.2 million (approximately $570,000). This came after a rejected offer by the Los Angeles Lakers who were trying to coax Webber in with two 10-day contracts so they could decide afterwards if they wanted him the rest of the season. This also put to rest talks of joining the Detroit Pistons, Dallas Mavericks, or retirement. He played in only nine games for the Warriors, averaging 3.9 points and 3.6 rebounds in 14 minutes per game.

On March 25, 2008, Webber retired from basketball due to persistent problems with his surgically repaired knee and was waived by the Warriors.
On March 27, 2008, Webber made his first appearance on television on Inside the &quot;NBA on TNT&quot;, alongside Charles Barkley and host Ernie Johnson. On April 25, 2008, TNT offered Webber a job to be a commentator for the postseason.

On February 6, 2009, Webber returned to ARCO Arena, home of the Sacramento Kings, to participate in the ceremonies surrounding the retirement of his jersey, #4.

Webber ranked #64 in &quot;SLAM Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Top 75 NBA players of all time in 2003 and ranked #11 in an ESPN.com experts poll of the top power forwards of all time in 2005. He also ranked #72 on a list of the Top 96 NBA players of all time in Bill Simmons&#x27; 2009 bestseller &quot;The Book of Basketball: The NBA According to the Sports Guy&quot;. In 2021, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Webber as the 65th greatest player in NBA history.

The Sacramento Kings retired Webber&#x27;s number 4 jersey on February 6, 2009, when the Kings hosted the Utah Jazz.

Webber was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021.

Webber&#x27;s youngest brother, David, matched his total with 3 Michigan High School Athletic Association state championships (1995–97), and became Mid-American Conference Men&#x27;s Basketball Player of the Year.

==Post-basketball life==

Since retiring from the NBA, Webber became an analyst on NBA TV&#x27;s &quot;NBA Gametime Live&quot;. He did the Tuesday Fan Night alongside Ernie Johnson and Kevin McHale. He also served as an occasional guest analyst (primary) on TNT&#x27;s &quot;Inside the NBA&quot; from 2008 to 2021. During Charles Barkley&#x27;s leave of absence, Webber substituted for him along with other guests such as Gary Payton and Mike Fratello. Since 2017, he was also a regular panelist during NBA on TNT&#x27;s Monday coverage called &quot;Players Only&quot;, which features only former NBA players as studio analysts, play-by-play announcers, and color analysts for games. In 2021, Webber parted ways with TNT on the eve of the NBA playoffs. Webber has expressed interest in eventually becoming a GM and owner.

In August 2010, Webber played in the NBA Asia Challenge 2010 at Araneta Coliseum in Metro Manila, an exhibition game which pitted NBA legends and NBA Development League players against Philippine Basketball Association stars and legends.

Webber was the owner of Center Court With C-Webb, a restaurant in Sacramento, California. Opening in 2006, the restaurant closed on November 17, 2009 falling victim to the Great Recession.

Earlier that year, Webber married his longtime girlfriend Erika Dates during a private ceremony at his Atlanta home. In attendance were 200 guests including family and close friends.

In 2015, Chris Webber was the executive producer for the independent romantic-drama film &quot;Somewhere in the Middle&quot; by Lanre Olabisi. Webber has also tried his hand at music production, producing Nas&#x27;s tracks &quot;Surviving the Times&quot; from his &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album and &quot;Blunt Ashes&quot; from &quot;Hip Hop Is Dead&quot;.

In late 2016, Webber began hosting &quot;Fearless or Insane&quot; on Podcast One. In 2018, with old age makeup, he played the role of Preacher in the film &quot;Uncle Drew&quot;, which starred Kyrie Irving.

In 2016, Webber began work as a professor of practice at Wake Forest University, teaching a class in sports storytelling. In 2021 he began teaching at Morehouse College, instructing an online course on athlete activism.

In 2021 Webber announced the launch of a private equity fund for investing in minority-owned cannabis businesses. He stated: &quot;It&#x27;s crucial that we diversify leadership within the cannabis industry and level the playing field for people from our communities. For far too long, minorities have been excessively punished and incarcerated for cannabis while others profited.&quot; In 2022 he announced the launch of &quot;Players Only&quot;, a cannabis brand that will feature flower strains, cartridges, pre-rolls, vapes, sport recovery and performance products, apparel, and more.

==Personal life==
===African-American artifacts===
Webber has a personal collection of African-American artifacts which he began collecting in 1994. He began collecting them upon entering the NBA, starting with the purchase of two slave records. Webber believes that these artifacts are a reflection of his beliefs and aspirations. He initially collected them as encouragements to face life obstacles. However, he had no intentions on exhibiting them until the growth of his collection prompted additional storage. His collection includes an original 1901 publication of an autobiography by Booker T. Washington, and various documents, letters, and postcards signed by Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X. When not on public exhibit, the artifacts are stored at the Sacramento Public Library&#x27;s Archival Vault. In previous years, the Chris Webber Collection has been featured in Crocker Art Museum and Wayne State University.

On June 28, 2007, Webber unveiled his collection of African-American artifacts during the Celebrating Heritage Exhibition at Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit. During a news conference, Webber said he believed that children can learn from these artifacts, &quot;Hopefully, when children see them they will see there is no excuse for us not to be successful. There&#x27;s no excuse not to find something that you love to do. There&#x27;s no excuse to not work hard at it.&quot;

===Charity===
Webber is active in various charities and created The Timeout Foundation in 1993. The foundation&#x27;s mission is to provide positive educational and recreational opportunities to youth.

In 1999, Webber created C-Webb&#x27;s Crew where a group of tickets at every Kings regular home season game would be donated to at-risk youth and their families. To date, over 3,000 youths and their families have attended a game through C-Webb&#x27;s Crew.

Community awards Webber has won include the inaugural Sacramento Kings/Oscar Robertson Triple Double Award, which is annually awarded to a Kings player who exemplifies: team leadership, all-around game, and sportsmanship; the NBA Community Assist Award for his contributions in February 2003, and the Wish Maker of the Year in 2003 awarded by the Sacramento Chapter of the Make a Wish Foundation.

Webber held a celebrity weekend, Bada Bling!, at the Caesars Palace Hotel in Las Vegas. The event was held from July 28–30, 2006, and included a live auction and celebrity poker tournament. Many renowned NBA players participated including then-current and former teammates: Mike Bibby, Brad Miller, Andre Iguodala, Bobby Jackson, Kyle Korver, and his then-current coach, Maurice Cheeks. Other notable participants included Charles Barkley, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Gary Payton, Kenny Smith, Moses Malone, and Stephon Marbury. Numerous entertainers attended as well such as Nas and Common. All of the proceeds were donated to The Timeout Foundation.

Webber hosted his 2nd annual Bada Bling charity weekend from July 20–22, 2007, at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas.

===Legal issues===
In 1998, Webber was arrested and charged with second-degree assault, resisting arrest, possession of marijuana, driving under the influence of marijuana and five other traffic-related violations after being pulled over for speeding on the way to the practice center at the Capital Center in Prince George&#x27;s County Maryland (The MCI Center was just finishing being built). Webber was eventually acquitted by a jury of the assault, resisting arrest, possession of marijuana and driving under the influence charges, and paid $560 in fines for lesser violations.

Later in 1998 during the off-season, while leaving Puerto Rico on a promotional tour for Fila sneakers, Webber paid a $500 fine after U.S. Customs found marijuana in his bag. Soon after Fila dropped Webber as an endorser, a three-member panel of arbitrators awarded Webber $2.61 million for breach of contract.

After the closing of his first restaurant, property owner Promenade filed a $3 million lawsuit in 2010. The claims were for violating terms of a 20-year lease signed in 2005. Promenade was seeking funds to help re-lease the property and overdue rent.

==Discography==
Webber also has produced hip hop records, including two songs for rapper Nas: &quot;Blunt Ashes&quot; and &quot;Surviving the Times&quot; and appeared on the skit Webber from Naughty by Nature&#x27;s Grammy Award-winning album Poverty&#x27;s Paradise.

<text>Otodus megalodon ( ; meaning &quot;big tooth&quot;), commonly known as megalodon, is an extinct species of giant mackerel shark that lived approximately 23 to 3.6 million years ago (Mya), from the Early Miocene to the Early Pliocene epochs. &quot;O. megalodon&quot; was formerly thought to be a member of the family Lamnidae and a close relative of the great white shark (&quot;Carcharodon carcharias&quot;), but has been reclassified into the extinct family Otodontidae, which diverged from the great white shark during the Early Cretaceous.

While regarded as one of the largest and most powerful predators to have ever lived, megalodon is only known from fragmentary remains, and its appearance and maximum size are uncertain. Scientists differ on whether it would have more closely resembled a stockier version of the great white shark (&quot;Carcharodon carcharias&quot;), the basking shark (&quot;Cetorhinus maximus&quot;) or the sand tiger shark (&quot;Carcharias taurus&quot;). The most recent estimate with the least error range suggests a maximum length estimate up to , although the modal lengths are estimated at . Their teeth were thick and robust, built for grabbing prey and breaking bone, and their large jaws could exert a bite force of up to .

Megalodon probably had a major impact on the structure of marine communities. The fossil record indicates that it had a cosmopolitan distribution. It probably targeted large prey, such as whales, seals and sea turtles. Juveniles inhabited warm coastal waters and fed on fish and small whales. Unlike the great white, which attacks prey from the soft underside, megalodon probably used its strong jaws to break through the chest cavity and puncture the heart and lungs of its prey.

The animal faced competition from whale-eating cetaceans, such as &quot;Livyatan&quot; and other macroraptorial sperm whales and possibly smaller ancestral killer whales (&quot;Orcinus&quot;). As the shark preferred warmer waters, it is thought that oceanic cooling associated with the onset of the ice ages, coupled with the lowering of sea levels and resulting loss of suitable nursery areas, may have also contributed to its decline. A reduction in the diversity of baleen whales and a shift in their distribution toward polar regions may have reduced megalodon&#x27;s primary food source. The shark&#x27;s extinction coincides with a gigantism trend in baleen whales.

== Classification ==
===Prescientific and early research history===
Megalodon teeth have been excavated and used since ancient times. They were a valued artifact amongst pre-Columbian cultures in the Americas for their large sizes and serrated blades, from which they were modified into projectile points, knives, jewelry, and funeral accessories. At least some, such as the Panamanian Sitio Conte societies, seemed to have used them primarily for ceremonial purposes. Mining of megalodon teeth by the Algonquin peoples in the Chesapeake Bay and their selective trade with the Adena culture in Ohio occurred as early as 430 BC. The earliest written account of megalodon teeth was by Pliny the Elder in an AD 73 volume of &quot;Historia Naturalis&quot;, who described them as resembling petrified human tongues that Roman folklorists believed to have fallen from the sky during lunar eclipses and called them &quot;glossopetrae&quot; (&quot;tongue stones&quot;). The purported tongues were later thought in a 12th-century Maltese tradition to have belonged to serpents that Paul the Apostle turned to stone while shipwrecked there, and were given antivenom powers by the saint. &quot;Glossopetrae&quot; reappeared throughout Europe in late 13th to 16th century literature, ascribed with more supernatural properties that cured a wider variety of poisons. Use of megalodon teeth for this purpose became widespread among medieval and Renaissance nobility, who fashioned them into protective amulets and tableware to purportedly detoxify poisoned liquids or bodies that touched the stones. By the 16th century, teeth were directly consumed as ingredients of European-made Goa stones.
The true nature of the &quot;glossopetrae&quot; as shark&#x27;s teeth was held by some since at least 1554, when cosmographer André Thevet described it as hearsay, although he did not believe it. The earliest scientific argument for this view was made by Italian naturalist Fabio Colonna, who in 1616 published an illustration of a Maltese megalodon tooth alongside a great white shark&#x27;s and noted their striking similarities. He argued that the former and its likenesses were not petrified serpent&#x27;s tongues but actually the teeth of similar sharks that washed up on shore. Colonna supported this thesis through an experiment of burning &quot;glossopetrae&quot; samples, from which he observed carbon residue he interpreted as proving an organic origin. However, interpretation of the stones as shark&#x27;s teeth remained widely unaccepted. This was in part due the inability to explain how some of them are found far from the sea. The shark tooth argument was academically raised again during the late 17th century by English scientists Robert Hooke, John Ray, and Danish naturalist Niels Steensen (Latinized &quot;Nicholas Steno&quot;). Steensen&#x27;s argument in particular is most recognized as inferred from his dissection of the head of a great white caught in 1666. His 1667 report depicted engravings of a shark&#x27;s head and megalodon teeth that became especially iconic. However, the illustrated head was not actually the head that Steensen dissected, nor were the fossil teeth illustrated by him. Both engravings were originally commissioned in the 1590s by Papal physician Michele Mercati, who also had in possession the head of a great white, for his book &quot;Metallotheca&quot;. The work remained unpublished in Steensen&#x27;s time due to Mercati&#x27;s premature death, and the former reused the two illustrations per suggestion by Carlo Roberto Dati, who thought a depiction of the actual dissected shark was unsuitable for readers. Steensen also stood out in pioneering a stratigraphic explanation for how similar stones appeared further inland. He observed that rock layers bearing megalodon teeth contained marine sediments and hypothesized that these layers correlated to a period of flood that was later covered by terrestrial layers and uplifted by geologic activity.
Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz gave megalodon its scientific name in his seminal 1833-1843 work &quot;Recherches sur les poissons fossiles&quot; (Research on fossil fish). He named it &quot;Carcharias megalodon&quot; in an 1835 illustration of the holotype and additional teeth, congeneric with the modern sand tiger shark. The specific name is a portmanteau of the Ancient Greek words μεγάλος (&quot;megálos&quot;, meaning &quot;big&quot;) and ὀδών (&quot;odṓn&quot;, meaning &quot;tooth&quot;), combined meaning &quot;big tooth&quot;. Agassiz referenced the name as early as 1832, but because specimens were not referenced they are not taxonomically recognized uses. Formal description of the species was published in an 1843 volume, where Agassiz revised the name to &quot;Carcharodon megalodon&quot; as its teeth were far too large for the former genus and more alike to the great white shark. He also erroneously identified several megalodon teeth as belonging to additional species eventually named &quot;Carcharodon rectidens&quot;, &quot;Carcharodon subauriculatus&quot;, &quot;Carcharodon productus&quot;, and &quot;Carcharodon polygurus&quot;. Because &quot;Carcharodon megalodon&quot; appeared first in the 1835 illustration, the remaining names are considered junior synonyms under the principle of priority.

=== Evolution ===
While the earliest megalodon remains have been reported from the Late Oligocene, around 28 million years ago (Mya), there is disagreement as to when it appeared, with dates ranging to as young as 16 mya. It has been thought that megalodon became extinct around the end of the Pliocene, about 2.6 Mya; claims of Pleistocene megalodon teeth, younger than 2.6 million years old, are considered unreliable. A 2019 assessment moves the extinction date back to earlier in the Pliocene, 3.6 Mya.

Megalodon is considered to be a member of the family Otodontidae, genus &quot;Otodus&quot;, as opposed to its previous classification into Lamnidae, genus &quot;Carcharodon&quot;. Megalodon&#x27;s classification into &quot;Carcharodon&quot; was due to dental similarity with the great white shark, but most authors believe that this is due to convergent evolution. In this model, the great white shark is more closely related to the extinct broad-toothed mako (&quot;Cosmopolitodus hastalis&quot;) than to megalodon, as evidenced by more similar dentition in those two sharks; megalodon teeth have much finer serrations than great white shark teeth. The great white shark is more closely related to the mako sharks (&quot;Isurus&quot; spp.), with a common ancestor around 4 Mya. Proponents of the former model, wherein megalodon and the great white shark are more closely related, argue that the differences between their dentition are minute and obscure.
The genus &quot;Carcharocles&quot; contains four species: &quot;C. auriculatus&quot;, &quot;C. angustidens&quot;, &quot;C. chubutensis&quot;, and &quot;C. megalodon&quot;. The evolution of this lineage is characterized by the increase of serrations, the widening of the crown, the development of a more triangular shape, and the disappearance of the lateral cusps. The evolution in tooth morphology reflects a shift in predation tactics from a tearing-grasping bite to a cutting bite, likely reflecting a shift in prey choice from fish to cetaceans. Lateral cusplets were finally lost in a gradual process that took roughly 12 million years during the transition between &quot;C. chubutensis&quot; and &quot;C. megalodon&quot;. The genus was proposed by D. S. Jordan and H. Hannibal in 1923 to contain &quot;C. auriculatus&quot;. In the 1980s, megalodon was assigned to &quot;Carcharocles&quot;. Before this, in 1960, the genus &quot;Procarcharodon&quot; was erected by French ichthyologist Edgard Casier, which included those four sharks and was considered separate from the great white shark. It is since considered a junior synonym of &quot;Carcharocles&quot;. The genus &quot;Palaeocarcharodon&quot; was erected alongside &quot;Procarcharodon&quot; to represent the beginning of the lineage, and, in the model wherein megalodon and the great white shark are closely related, their last common ancestor. It is believed to be an evolutionary dead-end and unrelated to the &quot;Carcharocles&quot; sharks by authors who reject that model.
Another model of the evolution of this genus, also proposed by Casier in 1960, is that the direct ancestor of the &quot;Carcharocles&quot; is the shark &quot;Otodus obliquus&quot;, which lived from the Paleocene through the Miocene epochs, 60 to 13 Mya. The genus &quot;Otodus&quot; is ultimately derived from &quot;Cretolamna&quot;, a shark from the Cretaceous period. In this model, &quot;O. obliquus&quot; evolved into &quot;O. aksuaticus&quot;, which evolved into &quot;C. auriculatus&quot;, and then into &quot;C. angustidens&quot;, and then into &quot;C. chubutensis&quot;, and then finally into &quot;C. megalodon&quot;.

Another model of the evolution of &quot;Carcharocles&quot;, proposed in 2001 by paleontologist Michael Benton, is that the three other species are actually a single species of shark that gradually changed over time between the Paleocene and the Pliocene, making it a chronospecies. Some authors suggest that &quot;C. auriculatus&quot;, &quot;C. angustidens&quot;, and &quot;C. chubutensis&quot; should be classified as a single species in the genus &quot;Otodus&quot;, leaving &quot;C. megalodon&quot; the sole member of &quot;Carcharocles&quot;.

The genus &quot;Carcharocles&quot; may be invalid, and the shark may actually belong in the genus &quot;Otodus&quot;, making it &quot;Otodus megalodon&quot;. A 1974 study on Paleogene sharks by Henri Cappetta erected the subgenus &quot;Megaselachus&quot;, classifying the shark as &quot;Otodus&quot; (&quot;Megaselachus&quot;) &quot;megalodon&quot;, along with &quot;O. (M.) chubutensis&quot;. A 2006 review of Chondrichthyes elevated &quot;Megaselachus&quot; to genus, and classified the sharks as &quot;Megaselachus megalodon&quot; and &quot;M. chubutensis&quot;. The discovery of fossils assigned to the genus &quot;Megalolamna&quot; in 2016 led to a re-evaluation of &quot;Otodus&quot;, which concluded that it is paraphyletic, that is, it consists of a last common ancestor but it does not include all of its descendants. The inclusion of the &quot;Carcharocles&quot; sharks in &quot;Otodus&quot; would make it monophyletic, with the sister clade being &quot;Megalolamna&quot;.

The cladogram below represents the hypothetical relationships between megalodon and other sharks, including the great white shark. Modified from Shimada et al. (2016), Ehret et al., (2009), and the findings of Siversson et al. (2015).
== Biology ==
=== Appearance ===

One interpretation on how megalodon appeared was that it was a robust-looking shark, and may have had a similar build to the great white shark. The jaws may have been blunter and wider than the great white, and the fins would have also been similar in shape, though thicker due to its size. It may have had a pig-eyed appearance, in that it had small, deep-set eyes.

Another interpretation is that megalodon bore a similarity to the whale shark (&quot;Rhincodon typus&quot;) or the basking shark (&quot;Cetorhinus maximus&quot;). The tail fin would have been crescent-shaped, the anal fin and second dorsal fin would have been small, and there would have been a caudal keel present on either side of the tail fin (on the caudal peduncle). This build is common in other large aquatic animals, such as whales, tuna, and other sharks, in order to reduce drag while swimming. The head shape can vary between species as most of the drag-reducing adaptations are toward the tail-end of the animal.

One associated set of megalodon remains was found with placoid scales, which are in maximum width, and have broadly spaced keels.

=== Size ===

Due to fragmentary remains, there have been many contradictory size estimates for megalodon, as they can only be drawn from fossil teeth and vertebrae. The great white shark has been the basis of reconstruction and size estimation, as it is regarded as the best analogue to megalodon. Several total length estimation methods have been produced from comparing megalodon teeth and vertebrae to those of the great white.

Megalodon size estimates vary depending on the method used, with maximum total length estimates ranging from . A 2015 study estimated the modal total body length at , calculated from 544 megalodon teeth, found throughout geological time and geography, including juveniles and adults ranging from in total length. In comparison, large great white sharks are generally around in length, with a few contentious reports suggesting larger sizes. The whale shark is the largest living fish, with one large female reported with a precaudal length of and an estimated total length of . It is possible that different populations of megalodon around the globe had different body sizes and behaviors due to different ecological pressures. Megalodon is thought to have been the largest macropredatory shark that ever lived.

In his 2015 book, &quot;The Story of Life in 25 Fossils: Tales of Intrepid Fossil Hunters and the Wonders of Evolution&quot;, Donald Prothero proposed the body mass estimates for different individuals of different length by extrapolating from a vertebral centra based on the dimensions of the great white, a methodology also used for the 2008 study which supports the maximum mass estimate.

In 2020, Cooper and his colleagues reconstructed a 2D model of megalodon based on the dimensions of all the extant lamnid sharks and suggested that a long megalodon would have had a long head, tall gill slits, a tall dorsal fin, long pectoral fins, and a tall tail fin. In 2022, Cooper and his colleagues also reconstructed a 3D model with the same basis as the 2020 study, resulting in a body mass estimate of for a long megalodon (higher than the previous estimates); a vertebral column specimen named IRSNB P 9893 (formerly IRSNB 3121), belonging to a 46 year old individual from Belgium, was used for extrapolation. An individual of this size would have required 98,175 kcal per day, 20 times more than what the adult great white requires.

Mature male megalodon may have had a body mass of , and mature females may have been , assuming that males could range in length from and females .

A 2015 study linking shark size and typical swimming speed estimated that megalodon would have typically swum at –assuming that its body mass was typically –which is consistent with other aquatic creatures of its size, such as the fin whale (&quot;Balaenoptera physalus&quot;) which typically cruises at speeds of . In 2022, Cooper and his colleagues converted this calculation into relative cruising speed (body lengths per second), resulting in a mean absolute cruising speed of and a mean relative cruising speed of 0.09 body lengths per second for a long megalodon; the authors found their mean absolute cruising speed to be faster than any extant lamnid sharks and their mean relative cruising speed to be slower, consistent with previous estimates.

Its large size may have been due to climatic factors and the abundance of large prey items, and it may have also been influenced by the evolution of regional endothermy (mesothermy) which would have increased its metabolic rate and swimming speed. The otodontid sharks have been considered to have been ectotherms, so on that basis megalodon would have been ectothermic. However, the largest contemporary ectothermic sharks, such as the whale shark, are filter feeders, while lamnids are regional endotherms, implying some metabolic correlations with a predatory lifestyle. These considerations, as well as tooth oxygen isotopic data and the need for higher burst swimming speeds in macropredators of endothermic prey than ectothermy would allow, imply that otodontids, including megalodon, were probably regional endotherms.

In 2020, Shimada and colleagues suggested large size was instead due to intrauterine cannibalism, where the larger fetus eats the smaller fetus, resulting in progressively larger and larger fetuses, requiring the mother to attain even greater size as well as caloric requirements which would have promoted endothermy. Males would have needed to keep up with female size in order to still effectively copulate (which probably involved latching onto the female with claspers, like modern cartilaginous fish).

==== Maximum estimates ====
The first attempt to reconstruct the jaw of megalodon was made by Bashford Dean in 1909, displayed at the American Museum of Natural History. From the dimensions of this jaw reconstruction, it was hypothesized that megalodon could have approached in length. Dean had overestimated the size of the cartilage on both jaws, causing it to be too tall.

In 1973, John E. Randall, an ichthyologist, used the enamel height (the vertical distance of the blade from the base of the enamel portion of the tooth to its tip) to measure the length of the shark, yielding a maximum length of about . However, tooth enamel height does not necessarily increase in proportion to the animal&#x27;s total length.

In 1994, marine biologists Patrick J. Schembri and Stephen Papson opined that &quot;O. megalodon&quot; may have approached a maximum of around in total length.

In 1996, shark researchers Michael D. Gottfried, Leonard Compagno, and S. Curtis Bowman proposed a linear relationship between the great white shark&#x27;s total length and the height of the largest upper anterior tooth. The proposed relationship is: total length in meters = − (0.096) × [UA maximum height (mm)]-(0.22). Using this tooth height regression equation, the authors estimated a total length of based on a tooth tall, which the authors considered a conservative maximum estimate. They also compared the ratio between the tooth height and total length of large female great whites to the largest megalodon tooth. A long female great white, which the authors considered the largest &#x27;reasonably trustworthy&#x27; total length, produced an estimate of . However, based on the largest female great white reported, at , they estimated a maximum estimate of .

In 2002, shark researcher Clifford Jeremiah proposed that total length was proportional to the root width of an upper anterior tooth. He claimed that for every of root width, there are approximately of shark length. Jeremiah pointed out that the jaw perimeter of a shark is directly proportional to its total length, with the width of the roots of the largest teeth being a tool for estimating jaw perimeter. The largest tooth in Jeremiah&#x27;s possession had a root width of about , which yielded in total length.

In 2002, paleontologist Kenshu Shimada of DePaul University proposed a linear relationship between tooth crown height and total length after conducting anatomical analysis of several specimens, allowing any sized tooth to be used. Shimada stated that the previously proposed methods were based on a less-reliable evaluation of the dental homology between megalodon and the great white shark, and that the growth rate between the crown and root is not isometric, which he considered in his model. Using this model, the upper anterior tooth possessed by Gottfried and colleagues corresponded to a total length of . Among several specimens found in the Gatún Formation of Panama, one upper lateral tooth was used by other researchers to obtain a total length estimate of using this method.

In 2019, Shimada revisited the size of megalodon and discouraged using non-anterior teeth for estimations, noting that the exact position of isolated non-anterior teeth is difficult to identify. Shimada provided maximum total length estimates using the largest anterior teeth available in museums. The tooth with the tallest crown height known to Shimada, NSM PV-19896, produced a total length estimate of . The tooth with the tallest total height, FMNH PF 11306, was reported at . However, Shimada remeasured the tooth and found it actually to measure . Using the total height tooth regression equation proposed by Gottfried and colleagues produced an estimate of .

In 2021, Victor J. Perez, Ronny M. Leder, and Teddy Badaut proposed a method of estimating total length of megalodon from the sum of the tooth crown widths. Using more complete megalodon dentitions, they reconstructed the dental formula and then made comparisons to living sharks. The researchers noted that the 2002 Shimada crown height equations produce wildly varying results for different teeth belonging to the same shark (range of error of ± ), casting doubt on some of the conclusions of previous studies using that method. Using the largest tooth available to the authors, GHC 6, with a crown width of , they estimated a maximum body length of approximately , with a range of error of approximately ± . This maximum length estimate was also supported by Cooper and his colleagues in 2022.

There are anecdotal reports of teeth larger than those found in museum collections. Gordon Hubbell from Gainesville, Florida, possesses an upper anterior megalodon tooth whose maximum height is , one of the largest known tooth specimens from the shark. In addition, a megalodon jaw reconstruction developed by fossil hunter Vito Bertucci contains a tooth whose maximum height is reportedly over .

=== Teeth and bite force ===

The most common fossils of megalodon are its teeth. Diagnostic characteristics include a triangular shape, robust structure, large size, fine serrations, a lack of lateral denticles, and a visible V-shaped neck (where the root meets the crown). The tooth met the jaw at a steep angle, similar to the great white shark. The tooth was anchored by connective tissue fibers, and the roughness of the base may have added to mechanical strength. The lingual side of the tooth, the part facing the tongue, was convex; and the labial side, the other side of the tooth, was slightly convex or flat. The anterior teeth were almost perpendicular to the jaw and symmetrical, whereas the posterior teeth were slanted and asymmetrical.

Megalodon teeth can measure over in slant height (diagonal length) and are the largest of any known shark species, implying it was the largest of all macropredatory sharks. In 1989, a nearly complete set of megalodon teeth was discovered in Saitama, Japan. Another nearly complete associated megalodon dentition was excavated from the Yorktown Formations in the United States, and served as the basis of a jaw reconstruction of megalodon at the National Museum of Natural History (USNM). Based on these discoveries, an artificial dental formula was put together for megalodon in 1996.

The dental formula of megalodon is: . As evident from the formula, megalodon had four kinds of teeth in its jaws: anterior, intermediate, lateral, and posterior. Megalodon&#x27;s intermediate tooth technically appears to be an upper anterior and is termed as &quot;A3&quot; because it is fairly symmetrical and does not point mesially (side of the tooth toward the midline of the jaws where the left and right jaws meet). Megalodon had a very robust dentition, and had over 250 teeth in its jaws, spanning 5 rows. It is possible that large megalodon individuals had jaws spanning roughly across. The teeth were also serrated, which would have improved efficiency in cutting through flesh or bone. The shark may have been able to open its mouth to a 75° angle, though a reconstruction at the USNM approximates a 100° angle.
In 2008, a team of scientists led by S. Wroe conducted an experiment to determine the bite force of the great white shark, using a long specimen, and then isometrically scaled the results for its maximum size and the conservative minimum and maximum body mass of megalodon. They placed the bite force of the latter between in a posterior bite, compared to the bite force for the largest confirmed great white shark, and for the placoderm fish &quot;Dunkleosteus&quot;. In addition, Wroe and colleagues pointed out that sharks shake sideways while feeding, amplifying the force generated, which would probably have caused the total force experienced by prey to be higher than the estimate.

In 2021, Antonio Ballell and Humberto Ferrón used Finite Element Analysis modeling to examine the stress distribution of three types of megalodon teeth and closely related mega-toothed species when exposed to anterior and lateral forces, the latter of which would be generated when a shark shakes its head to tear through flesh. The resulting simulations identified higher levels of stress in megalodon teeth under lateral force loads compared to its precursor species such as &quot;O. obliquus&quot; and &quot;O. angusteidens&quot; when tooth size was removed as a factor. This suggests that megalodon teeth were of a different functional significance than previously expected, challenging prior interpretations that megalodon&#x27;s dental morphology was primarily driven by a dietary shift towards marine mammals. Instead, the authors proposed that it was a byproduct of an increase in body size caused by heterochronic selection.

=== Internal anatomy ===
Megalodon is represented in the fossil record by teeth, vertebral centra, and coprolites. As with all sharks, the skeleton of megalodon was formed of cartilage rather than bone; consequently most fossil specimens are poorly preserved. To support its large dentition, the jaws of megalodon would have been more massive, stouter, and more strongly developed than those of the great white, which possesses a comparatively gracile dentition. Its chondrocranium, the cartilaginous skull, would have had a blockier and more robust appearance than that of the great white. Its fins were proportional to its larger size.

Some fossil vertebrae have been found. The most notable example is a partially preserved vertebral column of a single specimen, excavated in the Antwerp Basin, Belgium, in 1926. It comprises 150 vertebral centra, with the centra ranging from to in diameter. The shark&#x27;s vertebrae may have gotten much bigger, and scrutiny of the specimen revealed that it had a higher vertebral count than specimens of any known shark, possibly over 200 centra; only the great white approached it. Another partially preserved vertebral column of a megalodon was excavated from the Gram Formation in Denmark in 1983, which comprises 20 vertebral centra, with the centra ranging from to in diameter.

The coprolite remains of megalodon are spiral-shaped, indicating that the shark may have had a spiral valve, a corkscrew-shaped portion of the lower intestines, similar to extant lamniform sharks. Miocene coprolite remains were discovered in Beaufort County, South Carolina, with one measuring .

Gottfried and colleagues reconstructed the entire skeleton of megalodon, which was later put on display at the Calvert Marine Museum in the United States and the Iziko South African Museum. This reconstruction is long and represents a mature male, based on the ontogenetic changes a great white shark experiences over the course of its life.

== Paleobiology ==

=== Prey relationships ===

Though sharks are generally opportunistic feeders, megalodon&#x27;s great size, high-speed swimming capability, and powerful jaws, coupled with an impressive feeding apparatus, made it an apex predator capable of consuming a broad spectrum of animals. Otodus megalodon was probably one of the most powerful predators to have existed. A study focusing on calcium isotopes of extinct and extant elasmobranch sharks and rays revealed that megalodon fed at a higher trophic level than the contemporaneous great white shark (&quot;higher up&quot; in the food chain).

Fossil evidence indicates that megalodon preyed upon many cetacean species, such as dolphins, small whales, cetotheres, squalodontids (shark toothed dolphins), sperm whales, bowhead whales, and rorquals. In addition to this, they also targeted seals, sirenians, and sea turtles. The shark was an opportunist and piscivorous, and it would have also gone after smaller fish and other sharks. Many whale bones have been found with deep gashes most likely made by their teeth. Various excavations have revealed megalodon teeth lying close to the chewed remains of whales, and sometimes in direct association with them.

The feeding ecology of megalodon appears to have varied with age and between sites, like the modern great white shark. It is plausible that the adult megalodon population off the coast of Peru targeted primarily cetothere whales in length and other prey smaller than itself, rather than large whales in the same size class as themselves. Meanwhile, juveniles likely had a diet that consisted more of fish.

=== Feeding strategies ===

Sharks often employ complex hunting strategies to engage large prey animals. Great white shark hunting strategies may be similar to how megalodon hunted its large prey. Megalodon bite marks on whale fossils suggest that it employed different hunting strategies against large prey than the great white shark.

One particular specimen–the remains of a long undescribed Miocene baleen whale–provided the first opportunity to quantitatively analyze its attack behavior. Unlike great whites which target the underbelly of their prey, megalodon probably targeted the heart and lungs, with their thick teeth adapted for biting through tough bone, as indicated by bite marks inflicted to the rib cage and other tough bony areas on whale remains. Furthermore, attack patterns could differ for prey of different sizes. Fossil remains of some small cetaceans, for example cetotheres, suggest that they were rammed with great force from below before being killed and eaten, based on compression fractures.

There is also evidence that a possible separate hunting strategy existed for attacking raptorial sperm whales; a tooth belonging to an undetermined physeteroid closely resembling those of &quot;Acrophyseter&quot; discovered in the Nutrien Aurora Phosphate Mine in North Carolina suggests that a megalodon or &quot;O. chubutensis&quot; may have aimed for the head of the sperm whale in order to inflict a fatal bite, the resulting attack leaving distinctive bite marks on the tooth. While scavenging behavior cannot be ruled out as a possibility, the placement of the bite marks is more consistent with predatory attacks than feeding by scavenging, as the jaw is not a particularly nutritious area to for a shark feed or focus on. The fact that the bite marks were found on the tooth&#x27;s roots further suggest that the shark broke the whale&#x27;s jaw during the bite, suggesting the bite was extremely powerful. The fossil is also notable as it stands as the first known instance of an antagonistic interaction between a sperm whale and an otodontid shark recorded in the fossil record.

During the Pliocene, larger cetaceans appeared. Megalodon apparently further refined its hunting strategies to cope with these large whales. Numerous fossilized flipper bones and tail vertebrae of large whales from the Pliocene have been found with megalodon bite marks, which suggests that megalodon would immobilize a large whale before killing and feeding on it.

=== Growth and reproduction ===

In 2010, Ehret estimated that megalodon had a fast growth rate nearly two times that of the extant great white shark. He also estimated that the slowing or cessation of somatic growth in megalodon occurred around 25 years of age, suggesting that this species had an extremely delayed sexual maturity. In 2021, Shimada and colleagues calculated the growth rate of an approximately individual based on the Belgian vertebrate column specimen that presumably contains annual growth rings on three of its vertebrae. They estimated the individual died at 46 years of age, with a growth rate of per year, and a length of at birth. For a individualwhich they considered to have been the maximum size attainablethis would equate to a lifespan of 88 to 100 years. However, Cooper and his colleagues in 2022 estimated the length of this 46 year old individual at nearly based on the 3D reconstruction which resulted in the complete vertebral column to be long; the researchers claimed that this size estimate difference occurred due to the fact that Shimada and his colleagues extrapolated its size only based on the vertebral centra.

Megalodon, like contemporaneous sharks, made use of nursery areas to birth their young in, specifically warm-water coastal environments with large amounts of food and protection from predators. Nursery sites were identified in the Gatún Formation of Panama, the Calvert Formation of Maryland, Banco de Concepción in the Canary Islands, and the Bone Valley Formation of Florida. Given that all extant lamniform sharks give birth to live young, this is believed to have been true of megalodon also. Infant megalodons were around at their smallest, and the pups were vulnerable to predation by other shark species, such as the great hammerhead shark (&quot;Sphyrna mokarran&quot;) and the snaggletooth shark (&quot;Hemipristis serra&quot;). Their dietary preferences display an ontogenetic shift: Young megalodon commonly preyed on fish, sea turtles, dugongs, and small cetaceans; mature megalodon moved to off-shore areas and consumed large cetaceans.

An exceptional case in the fossil record suggests that juvenile megalodon may have occasionally attacked much larger balaenopterid whales. Three tooth marks apparently from a long Pliocene shark were found on a rib from an ancestral blue or humpback whale that showed evidence of subsequent healing, which is suspected to have been inflicted by a juvenile megalodon.

== Paleoecology ==
=== Range and habitat ===
Megalodon had a cosmopolitan distribution; its fossils have been excavated from many parts of the world, including Europe, Africa, the Americas, and Australia. It most commonly occurred in subtropical to temperate latitudes. It has been found at latitudes up to 55° N; its inferred tolerated temperature range was . It arguably had the capacity to endure such low temperatures due to mesothermy, the physiological capability of large sharks to maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water by conserving metabolic heat.

Megalodon inhabited a wide range of marine environments (i.e., shallow coastal waters, areas of coastal upwelling, swampy coastal lagoons, sandy littorals, and offshore deep water environments), and exhibited a transient lifestyle. Adult megalodon were not abundant in shallow water environments, and mostly inhabited offshore areas. Megalodon may have moved between coastal and oceanic waters, particularly in different stages of its life cycle.

Fossil remains show a trend for specimens to be larger on average in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern, with mean lengths of , respectively; and also larger in the Pacific than the Atlantic, with mean lengths of respectively. They do not suggest any trend of changing body size with absolute latitude, or of change in size over time (although the &quot;Carcharocles&quot; lineage in general is thought to display a trend of increasing size over time). The overall modal length has been estimated at , with the length distribution skewed towards larger individuals, suggesting an ecological or competitive advantage for larger body size.

==== Locations of fossils ====
Megalodon had a global distribution and fossils of the shark have been found in many places around the world, bordering all oceans of the Neogene.

=== Competition ===

Megalodon faced a highly competitive environment. Its position at the top of the food chain probably had a significant impact on the structuring of marine communities. Fossil evidence indicates a correlation between megalodon and the emergence and diversification of cetaceans and other marine mammals. Juvenile megalodon preferred habitats where small cetaceans were abundant, and adult megalodon preferred habitats where large cetaceans were abundant. Such preferences may have developed shortly after they appeared in the Oligocene.

Megalodon were contemporaneous with whale-eating toothed whales (particularly macroraptorial sperm whales and squalodontidae), which were also probably among the era&#x27;s apex predators, and provided competition. Some attained gigantic sizes, such as &quot;Livyatan&quot;, estimated between . Fossilized teeth of an undetermined species of such physeteroids from Lee Creek Mine, North Carolina, indicate it had a maximum body length of and a maximum lifespan of about 25 years. This is very different from similarly sized modern killer whales that live to 65 years, suggesting that unlike the latter, which are apex predators, these physeteroids were subject to predation from larger species such as megalodon or &quot;Livyatan&quot;. By the Late Miocene, around 11 Mya, macroraptorials experienced a significant decline in abundance and diversity. Other species may have filled this niche in the Pliocene, such as the fossil killer whale &quot;Orcinus citoniensis&quot; which may have been a pack predator and targeted prey larger than itself, but this inference is disputed, and it was probably a generalist predator rather than a marine mammal specialist.

Megalodon may have subjected contemporaneous white sharks to competitive exclusion, as the fossil records indicate that other shark species avoided regions it inhabited by mainly keeping to the colder waters of the time. In areas where their ranges seemed to have overlapped, such as in Pliocene Baja California, it is possible that megalodon and the great white shark occupied the area at different times of the year while following different migratory prey. Megalodon probably also had a tendency for cannibalism, much like contemporary sharks.

== Extinction ==
=== Climate change ===
The Earth experienced a number of changes during the time period megalodon existed which affected marine life. A cooling trend starting in the Oligocene 35 Mya ultimately led to glaciation at the poles. Geological events changed currents and precipitation; among these were the closure of the Central American Seaway and changes in the Tethys Ocean, contributing to the cooling of the oceans. The stalling of the Gulf Stream prevented nutrient-rich water from reaching major marine ecosystems, which may have negatively affected its food sources. The largest fluctuation of sea levels in the Cenozoic era occurred in the Plio-Pleistocene, between around 5 million to 12 thousand years ago, due to the expansion of glaciers at the poles, which negatively impacted coastal environments, and may have contributed to its extinction along with those of several other marine megafaunal species. These oceanographic changes, in particular the sea level drops, may have restricted many of the suitable shallow warm-water nursery sites for megalodon, hindering reproduction. Nursery areas are pivotal for the survival of many shark species, in part because they protect juveniles from predation.

As its range did not apparently extend into colder waters, megalodon may not have been able to retain a significant amount of metabolic heat, so its range was restricted to shrinking warmer waters. Fossil evidence confirms the absence of megalodon in regions around the world where water temperatures had significantly declined during the Pliocene. However, an analysis of the distribution of megalodon over time suggests that temperature change did not play a direct role in its extinction. Its distribution during the Miocene and Pliocene did not correlate with warming and cooling trends; while abundance and distribution declined during the Pliocene, megalodon did show a capacity to inhabit colder latitudes. It was found in locations with a mean temperature ranging from , with a total range of , indicating that the global extent of suitable habitat should not have been greatly affected by the temperature changes that occurred. This is consistent with evidence that it was a mesotherm.

=== Changing ecosystem ===

Marine mammals attained their greatest diversity during the Miocene, such as with baleen whales with over 20 recognized Miocene genera in comparison to only six extant genera. Such diversity presented an ideal setting to support a super-predator such as megalodon. By the end of the Miocene, many species of mysticetes had gone extinct; surviving species may have been faster swimmers and thus more elusive prey. Furthermore, after the closure of the Central American Seaway, tropical whales decreased in diversity and abundance. The extinction of megalodon correlates with the decline of many small mysticete lineages, and it is possible that it was quite dependent on them as a food source. Additionally, a marine megafauna extinction during the Pliocene was discovered to have eliminated 36% of all large marine species including 55% of marine mammals, 35% of seabirds, 9% of sharks, and 43% of sea turtles. The extinction was selective for endotherms and mesotherms relative to poikilotherms, implying causation by a decreased food supply and thus consistent with megalodon being mesothermic. Megalodon may have been too large to sustain itself on the declining marine food resources. The cooling of the oceans during the Pliocene might have restricted the access of megalodon to the polar regions, depriving it of the large whales which had migrated there.

Competition from large odontocetes, such as macropredatory sperm whales which appeared in the Miocene, and a member of genus &quot;Orcinus&quot; (i.e., &quot;Orcinus citoniensis&quot;) in the Pliocene, is assumed to have contributed to the decline and extinction of megalodon. But this assumption is disputed: The Orcininae emerged in Mid-Pliocene with &quot;O. citoniensis&quot; reported from the
Pliocene of Italy, and similar forms reported from the Pliocene of England and South Africa, indicating the capacity of these dolphins to cope with increasingly prevalent cold water temperatures in high latitudes. These dolphins were assumed to have been macrophagous in some studies, but on closer inspection, these dolphins are not found to be macrophagous and fed on small fishes instead. On the other hand, gigantic macropredatory sperm whales such as &quot;Livyatan&quot;-like forms are last reported from Australia and South Africa circa 5 million years ago. Others, such as &quot;Hoplocetus&quot; and &quot;Scaldicetus&quot; also occupied a niche similar to that of modern killer whales but the last of these forms disappeared during the Pliocene. Members of genus &quot;Orcinus&quot; became large and macrophagous in the Pleistocene.

Paleontologist Robert Boessenecker and his colleagues rechecked the fossil record of megalodon for carbon dating errors and concluded that it disappeared circa 3.5 million years ago. Boessenecker and his colleagues further suggest that megalodon suffered range fragmentation due to climatic shifts, and competition with white sharks might have contributed to its decline and extinction. Competition with white sharks is assumed to be a factor in other studies as well, but this hypothesis warrants further testing. Multiple compounding environmental and ecological factors including climate change and thermal limitations, collapse of prey populations and resource competition with white sharks are believed to have contributed to decline and extinction of megalodon.

The extinction of megalodon set the stage for further changes in marine communities. The average body size of baleen whales increased significantly after its disappearance, although possibly due to other, climate-related, causes. Conversely the increase in baleen whale size may have contributed to the extinction of megalodon, as they may have preferred to go after smaller whales; bite marks on large whale species may have come from scavenging sharks. Megalodon may have simply become coextinct with smaller whale species, such as &quot;Piscobalaena nana&quot;. The extinction of megalodon had a positive impact on other apex predators of the time, such as the great white shark, in some cases spreading to regions where megalodon became absent.

== In popular culture ==
Megalodon has been portrayed in many works of fiction, including films and novels, and continues to be a popular subject for fiction involving sea monsters. Reports of supposedly fresh megalodon teeth, such as those found by in 1873 which were dated in 1959 by the zoologist Wladimir Tschernezky to be around 11,000 to 24,000 years old, helped popularise claims of recent megalodon survival amongst cryptozoologists. These claims have been discredited, and are probably teeth that were well-preserved by a thick mineral-crust precipitate of manganese dioxide, and so had a lower decomposition rate and retained a white color during fossilization. Fossil megalodon teeth can vary in color from off-white to dark browns, greys, and blues, and some fossil teeth may have been redeposited into a younger stratum. The claims that megalodon could remain elusive in the depths, similar to the megamouth shark which was discovered in 1976, are unlikely as the shark lived in warm coastal waters and probably could not survive in the cold and nutrient-poor deep sea environment. Alleged sightings of the megalodon have been noted to be likely hoaxes or misidentifications of the whale shark, which shared many visual characteristics with megalodon sightings.

Contemporary fiction about megalodon surviving into modern times was pioneered by the 1997 novel &quot;&quot; by Steve Alten and its subsequent sequels. Megalodon subsequently began to feature in films, such as the 2002 direct to video &quot;Shark Attack 3: Megalodon&quot;, and later &quot;The Meg,&quot; a 2018 film based on the 1997 book which grossed over $500 million at the box office.

Animal Planet&#x27;s pseudo-documentary &quot;&quot; included an encounter 1.6 mya between a pod of mermaids and a megalodon. Later, in August 2013, the Discovery Channel opened its annual Shark Week series with another film for television, &quot;&quot;, a controversial docufiction about the creature that presented alleged evidence in order to suggest that megalodons still lived. This program received criticism for being completely fictional and for inadequately disclosing its fictional nature; for example, all of the supposed scientists depicted were paid actors, and there was no disclosure in the documentary itself that it was fictional. In a poll by Discovery, 73% of the viewers of the documentary thought that megalodon was not extinct. In 2014, Discovery re-aired &quot;The Monster Shark Lives&quot;, along with a new one-hour program, &quot;Megalodon: The New Evidence&quot;, and an additional fictionalized program entitled &quot;Shark of Darkness: Wrath of Submarine&quot;, resulting in further backlash from media sources and the scientific community. Despite the criticism from scientists, &quot;Megalodon: The Monster Shark Lives&quot; was a huge ratings success, gaining 4.8 million viewers, the most for any Shark Week episode up to that point.

Megalodon teeth are the state fossil of North Carolina.

<doc id="529148" wikidata="Q2600867" url="?curid=529148" title="Yorkshire Three Peaks">
<text>The mountains of Whernside (), Ingleborough () and Pen-y-ghent () are collectively known as the
Three Peaks. The peaks, which form part of the
Pennine range, encircle the head of the valley of the River Ribble in the Yorkshire Dales National Park in the North of England.

==Name==

The long-standing designation &quot;The Three Peaks&quot; is well known locally, and in past times nationally. However, there are now a number of &quot;National&quot; Three Peaks adventure challenges involving Ben Nevis, Snowdon and Scafell Pike (respectively the highest summits in Scotland, Wales and England). The epithet &quot;Yorkshire&quot; is therefore now commonly added to differentiate Yorkshire&#x27;s Three Peaks from those (although Whernside is partially in Cumbria, with the summit trig point being narrowly on the Cumbria side, the whole mountain is within the historic county of Yorkshire).

==Geology==
In common with neighbouring fells, the Three Peaks are carved from an almost flat-lying succession of sedimentary strata of Carboniferous age. The lower slopes of each of the fells are formed from massive limestones assigned to the Visean age Great Scar Group. The upper slopes of each of the fells are formed from alternating bands of limestone and mudstone grading up into sandstone, all of which are assigned to the Brigantian and early Namurian ages Yoredale Group. These alternations are considered to be a classic British example of cyclothems. Differential weathering and erosion of the various bands has given Ingleborough and Pen-y-ghent a distinctive, stepped appearance. The summits are capped by Grassington Grit, a variety of Millstone Grit.

Considerable areas of the flanks of each of the fells are covered by peat whilst other areas are blanketed by glacial till notably across the southern and eastern slopes of Pen-y-ghent. The Ribblehead drumlin field is considered to be one of the finest in England. Fringing Ingleborough on each side however are impressive areas of limestone pavement.

Extensive networks of caves have developed within the limestone strata such as the White Scar Caves, and potholes which attract cavers from all over the country. It is home to England&#x27;s highest waterfall at Gaping Gill, where the Fell Beck drops vertically down a pothole, into Britain&#x27;s second largest cavern. The beck re-emerges further down the mountain adjacent to Ingleborough Cave, where visitors can take a guided tour of a floodlit part of the cave system. Whernside, being more rounded, is visually less imposing than its neighbours, but its summit is the highest point in North Yorkshire.

==History==
The area is rich in historical interest. The summit of Ingleborough has the remains of a huge Iron Age hill fort, while the Settle-Carlisle Railway runs between the mountains, crossing Ribblehead Viaduct at the foot of Whernside.

==Leisure==
===Long-distance footpaths===

*The Pennine Way visits Horton and crosses the summit of Pen-y-ghent.
*The Ribble Way follows the River Ribble from its source near the foot of Whernside to its mouth near Preston.

===The Three Peaks walk===

The Three Peaks walk of Pen-y-ghent, Whernside and Ingleborough is probably the original three peak walk within the UK. The first recorded ascent of the three hills was in July 1887 by J. R. Wynne-Edwards and D. R. Smith in a time of 10 hours. The walk covers a distance of to (depending on route) circuit of all three peaks with nearly of ascent and descent. A challenge that many walkers aim for when undertaking the walk is to complete the walk in under 12 hours, though as Alfred Wainwright says in his book &quot;Wainwright in the Limestone Dales&quot;, &quot;Some participants have chosen to regard the walk as a race, and this is to be greatly regretted, walking is a pleasure to be enjoyed in comfort&quot; (edited quote). The route most walkers take varies from the fell race in that most traverse the &#x27;nose&#x27; of Pen-y-ghent from Brackenbottom Moor and do not ascend from the Pennine Way. Additionally, Whernside is generally traversed along the right-of-way to the east, initially following the railway line, all of which can add extra distance to the route.

For most people the route starts in the village of Horton-in-Ribblesdale, though many start from various points in the circular route, such as Chapel-le-Dale or Ribblehead Viaduct. Historically Chapel-le-Dale was the starting point though this probably changed when the Pen-y-ghent Cafe started running their clocking in and out service for walkers in 1968. The cafe is currently closed (@ March 2020) and as a result walkers can no longer register the beginning and end of their walk or pay to join the Pen-y-ghent Cafe&#x27;s privately owned &#x27;Three Peaks of Yorkshire Club&#x27;.

The Yorkshire Dales National Park runs a voluntary Friends of the Three Peaks project. The proceeds of this go towards the upkeep of the paths on the route. Certificates, medals and membership forms are awarded by local participating businesses.

====The walking challenge====
Understandably the Three Peaks Walk is seen by many as a challenge and it has become very popular for charity sponsored walks and Saturdays in early summer can see several hundred walkers make their way round the route.

===The races===
In addition to it being seen as a walking challenge it has also become a race for fell runners and cyclo-cross cyclists. However, there is no bridleway access to the peaks (except Ingleborough from the Ingleton side only) so any bicycle access is on a permissive basis on race days only.

*The Three Peaks Race, has been held annually since 1954 and traditionally started at the Hill Inn until 1975, when the start moved to Horton. In 2008 this race was also the World Long Distance Mountain Running Challenge. The current record time for the men&#x27;s race is 2:29:53, set by Jeff Norman on 28 April 1974. The current record time for the women&#x27;s race is 3:09:19, set by Victoria Wilkinson on 29 April 2017. 

*The Three Peaks Cyclo-Cross race follows a longer, , route across the peaks.

*Yorkshire 3 Peaks Ultra, is a self navigation trails ultra marathon held annually in October. Starting in Hawes, joining the classic Yorkshire Three Peaks route around Whernside, Ingleborough and Pen-y-ghent. Returning to Hawes via The Pennine Way.

==Media==
The Three Peaks were featured on the BBC Two programme &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; as one of the wonders of Yorkshire.

<doc id="529150" wikidata="Q1273740" url="?curid=529150" title="The Reverend Horton Heat">
<text>The Reverend Horton Heat is the stage name of American musician James C. Heath (born 1959) as well as the name of his psychobilly trio from Dallas. Heath is a singer, songwriter, and guitarist. A reviewer for the magazine &quot;Prick&quot; called Heath the &quot;godfather of modern rockabilly and psychobilly&quot;.

The group formed in 1986, playing its first gigs in Dallas&#x27; Deep Ellum neighborhood. The core members are Jim &quot;Reverend Horton&quot; Heath on guitars and lead vocals, and Jimbo Wallace on the upright bass. The band signed to Victory Records in 2012, and released its 12th studio album, &quot;Whole New Life,&quot; on November 30, 2018.

The band plays rock and roll with influences from 1950s country music, surf music, punk, big band, swing, and rockabilly standards.

==Early career==

Heath was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, where he grew up with an appreciation of rock, electric blues and rockabilly. He was influenced by country music artists including Junior Brown, Willie Nelson, and Merle Travis. He played in local bands until 1985 when he gained notice in Dallas as &quot;Reverend Horton Heat&quot;, the moniker bestowed by the owner of the Deep Ellum nightclub where he played.

Adding bassist Jimbo Wallace and drummer Taz Bentley in 1989, Reverend Horton Heat recorded for Sub Pop at Reciprocal Recording in Seattle and Crystal Clear in Dallas, which made up the majority of material on Reverend Horton Heat&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Smoke &#x27;Em If You Got &#x27;Em&quot; (1990). For their next album, the band recorded with Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers producing at Ardent Studios in Memphis, Tennessee: &quot;The Full-Custom Gospel Sounds of the Reverend Horton Heat&quot; (1993).
Interscope Records joined with Sub Pop to co-release the band&#x27;s third album &quot;Liquor in the Front&quot; (1994). Al Jourgensen of Ministry produced the album.

==Chart success==
Scott Churilla replaced Bentley as drummer in the mid-1990s, and the band released &quot;It&#x27;s Martini Time&quot; in 1996. The album brought the band its first &quot;Billboard&quot; chart success, reaching number 165 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. The band covered the boogie standard &quot;Rock the Joint&quot;, and the song &quot;It&#x27;s Martini Time&quot; was a minor hit. Later that year, Heath brought his street preacher style to the television series &quot;&quot; on NBC, and he appeared on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; on ABC in 1997.

The 2000 album &quot;Spend a Night in the Box&quot; was released through Time Bomb Recordings, with Paul Leary producing. The style was a return to straight-ahead rockabilly songs. The album rose through &quot;CMJ&quot; charts to peak at number 2 in May. The song &quot;Like a Rocket&quot; was the theme for the 2002 Daytona 500 autosports race. The band featured the song on their next album, &quot;Lucky 7&quot;.

Victory Records signed Reverend Horton Heat in 2012, and Scott Churilla returned to the band as drummer, playing for the next five years. An album titled &quot;Rev&quot; was released on January 21, 2014. A YouTube video for a single on the album, &quot;Let Me Teach You How to Eat,&quot; preceded the album on November 12, 2013. &quot;Rev&quot; rose to number 111 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, becoming the band&#x27;s highest-charting album. The band toured as the opening act for Motörhead, and recorded rock and roll songs with Motörhead&#x27;s Lemmy Kilmister, though the tapes are unreleased. Reverend Horton Heat also backed a number of other artists including Unknown Hinson, Jello Biafra, and Deke Dickerson. In 2017, drummer Churilla was replaced by Arjuna &quot;R.J.&quot; Contreras, formerly of the band Eleven Hundred Springs. Matt Jordan of West Virginia joined the band playing piano and organ as well as supporting vocals. They released the album &quot;Whole New Life&quot; in 2018.

In 2021, Heath and Wallace teamed with drummer Slim Jim Phantom from the Stray Cats to form a side project: The Jimbos. The trio was set to release a live album on called &quot;Live In Houston&quot; on December 22, 2023.

==Commercial appearances==
&quot;Psychobilly Freakout&quot;, and later &quot;Wiggle Stick&quot;, were both featured in video segments on the show &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. The song &quot;I Can&#x27;t Surf&quot; was part of the soundtrack of the video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot;, published in 2001. “In Your Wildest Dreams” was used in the NBC drama &quot;&quot;, episode “Full Moon” (season 4, episode 17, aired April 5, 1996), in which Reverend Horton Heat appears. &quot;Psychobilly Freakout&quot; was used on a commercial for Buell American Motorcycles and a slightly altered version was featured in the game &quot;Guitar Hero II&quot; and later on &quot;Guitar Hero Smash Hits&quot;. Their song &quot;Baddest of the Bad&quot; is featured on the soundtrack to &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Proving Ground&quot;. The 1997 video game &quot;Redneck Rampage&quot; also includes two of their songs, &quot;Wiggle Stick&quot; and &quot;Nurture My Pig!&quot;. The song &quot;Big Red Rocket of Love&quot; is featured in the video games &quot;The Sims 3&quot;, &quot;MotorStorm&quot; and &quot;Need for Speed: The Run&quot;, and a slightly altered version of the song was featured in a 1999 television commercial for the Mazda Miata. The song &quot;Pride of San Jacinto&quot; is featured on the video game &quot;Hot Wheels Turbo Racing&quot;. The song &quot;Let Me Teach You How to Eat&quot; was featured in a 2017 Subway commercial. The song &quot;Mad, Mad Heart&quot; is featured in the video game &quot;Far Cry 5&quot;.

==Equipment==
Heath has a signature guitar from Gretsch, a guitar company, the 6120RHH. One of his favorite vintage guitars is a 1954 Gibson ES-175, which he rarely plays on the road since its wiring buzzes in certain venues. His favorite amplifier was the Fender Super Reverb but is now the Gretsch Executive.

<text>The Fédération Internationale de Roller Sports (FIRS; ) was the world governing body for roller sports, including skateboarding, rink hockey, inline hockey, inline speed skating, inline alpine, downhill, roller derby, roller freestyle, inline freestyle, aggressive inline skating, inline figure skating and artistic roller skating. It was established in April 1924 in Montreux, Switzerland by two Swiss sportsmen, Fred Renkewitz and Otto Myer, who had close connections to the International Olympic Committee.

The FIRS gathered more than 100 national federations, including countries from every continent and they are affiliated with the International Skating Union.

A proposal to dissolve the federation and merge with the International Skateboarding Federation to form a new body known as World Skate was ratified in September 2017. Since 2017 World Skate has organised the World Roller Games, comprising all the world roller sport disciplines as regulated by the World Skate international federation.

==FIRS==
The FIRS aimed to foster the Roller Sports movement and participation on a global scale. Its areas of responsibility were as follows:
# Administration and Regulations
# Organizing international competitions
# Developing the movement worldwide
# Promoting

The authority of FIRS was recognized by the following organizations:
* International Olympic Committee (IOC)
* General Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF)
* International World Games Association (IWGA)
* Pan American Sports Organization (PASO)

FIRS recognized the following continental confederations:
* Africa – African Confederation of Sports of Roller Skating (ACSRS)
* Europe – Confédération Européenne de Roller Skating (CERS)
* Asia – Confederation of Asia Roller Sports (CARS)
* Oceania – Oceania Confederation of Roller Sports (OCRS)
* The Americas – Confederación Panamericana de Roller Sports (CPRS)

Each continental confederation comprises or recognizes, in turn, various national governing bodies and associations.

Skating is considered to be one of the most complete physical exercises that exist and enjoys huge popularity on a world level. According to the latest estimations, there are more than 40 million habitual users of recreational skates throughout the world.

<doc id="529154" wikidata="Q461457" url="?curid=529154" title="White Sea–Baltic Canal">
<text>The White Sea–Baltic Canal (), often abbreviated to White Sea Canal (), is a man-made ship canal in Russia opened on 2 August 1933. It connects the White Sea, in the Arctic Ocean, with Lake Onega, which is further connected to the Baltic Sea. Until 1961, it was called by its original name: the Stalin White Sea–Baltic Canal (&quot;Belomorsko-Baltiyskiy Kanal imeni Stalina&quot;).

The canal was constructed by forced labor of gulag inmates. Beginning and ending with a labor force of 126,000, between 12,000 and 25,000 laborers died according to official records, while Anne Applebaum&#x27;s estimate is 25,000 deaths.

The canal runs , partially along several canalized rivers and Lake Vygozero. As of 2008, it carries only light traffic of between ten and forty boats per day. Its economic advantages are limited by its minimal depth of , inadequate for most seagoing vessels. This depth typically corresponds to river craft with deadweight cargo up to 600 tonnes, while useful seagoing vessels of 2,000–3,000 dwt typically have drafts of . The canal was originally proposed to be deep; however, the cost and time constraints of Stalin&#x27;s first five-year plan forced the much shallower draught.

==Waterway==


The total length of the waterway is , of which are man-made. The current flows north from Lake Onega to the White Sea, and all navigation marks are set according to it. Once in Lake Onega, ships can exit the southwest shore through the Svir River (and its two locks) to reach Lake Ladoga and then proceed down the Neva River to Saint Petersburg and the Baltic Sea. Alternatively, from Lake Onega river ships can sail eastward into the Volga–Baltic Waterway.

===Route===
The canal begins near Povenets settlement in Povenets bay of Lake Onega. After Povenets there are seven locks close together, forming the &quot;Stairs of Povenets&quot;. These locks are the southern slope of the canal. The canal summit pond at 103 m elevation is long between locks 7 &amp; 8. The northern slope has twelve locks numbered 8–19. The route of the northern slope runs through five large lakes; Lake Matkozero between locks 8 &amp; 9, Lake Vygozero between locks 9 &amp; 10, Lake Palagorka between locks 10 &amp; 11, Lake Voitskoye between locks 11 &amp; 12 and Lake Matkozhnya between locks 13 &amp; 14. The canal empties out into the Soroka Bay of the White Sea at Belomorsk. The settlements of Povenets, Segezha, Nadvoitsy, Sosnovets, and Belomorsk are located along the canal.

===Sailing conditions===
Minimum lock dimensions are wide by long. The navigable channel is wide and deep, with a radius of curvature of . Speed is limited to in all artificial portions. In conditions of low visibility (less than one km) navigation is halted.

For the navigation seasons of 2008 to 2010, the canal locks were scheduled to operate from 20 May to 15–30 October, giving 148–163 navigation days per year.

===Profile===
The following illustration depicts the profile of the White Sea–Baltic Canal. The horizontal axis is the length of the canal. The vertical axis is the elevation of the canal segments above mean sea level, showing the summit level of 100m between Lakes Onego and Vygozero.
==Construction==
The Soviet Union presented the canal as an example of the success of the first five-year plan. Its construction was completed four months ahead of schedule, though it was too shallow for the planned use. The canal was constructed in twenty months, between 1931 and 1933, almost entirely by manual labor.

The canal was the first major project constructed in the Soviet Union using forced labor. Belbaltlag, the Directorate of the BBK Camps, managed the construction, supplying a workforce of an estimated 100,000 convicts, at the cost of huge casualties. Although prison labor camps were usually kept secret, the White Sea Canal was a propaganda showcase of convicts &quot;reforging&quot; themselves in useful labor (Soviet concept of &quot;perekovka&quot;, reforging or rehabilitation).

Marshall Berman states that &quot;The canal was a triumph of publicity; but if half the care that went into the public relations campaign had been devoted to the work itself, there would have been far fewer victims and far more development.&quot;

===Organization and management===

The workforce for the Canal was supplied by the Belbaltlag camp directorate (White Sea–Baltic Corrective Labor Camp Directorate, WSBC) of the OGPU GULAG.
*P. F. Aleksandrov (П. Ф. Александров), acting chief of WSBC, January 16, 1932, full chief from March 28, 1932, to at least January 15, 1933
*Matvei Berman, head of the Gulag during most of the 1930s, direct supervisor of Firin
*Semyon Firin, Chief of Construction, also mentioned in 1933 documents as chief of WSBC
*Naftaly Frenkel, Chief of Works, November 16, 1931, to the end of construction.
*Lazar Kogan, chief of the BBK Construction Directorate
*, deputy chief of the BBK Construction Directorate
*, chief of WSBC, November 16, 1931 – January 16, 1932, also assistant chief of the BBK Construction Directorate

Genrikh Yagoda, Deputy Chairman of the OGPU, as well as Berman, Firin, Kogan, and Rappoport were awarded the Order of Lenin for the completion of the canal by the Politburo on July 15, 1933.

===Working conditions===

The Soviets portrayed the project as evidence of the efficiency of the Gulag. Supposedly &quot;reforging class enemies&quot; (political prisoners) through &quot;corrective labor&quot;, the working conditions at the BBK Camp were brutal, with the prisoners given only primitive hand tools to carry out the massive construction project. The mortality rate was about 8.7%, with many more sick and disabled.

The workforce was organized into brigades of 25–30, which made up phalanges of 250–300. There were norms for labor, for example of hand-dug stone per day per brigade. There was an extensive system of incentives for prisoners in place. The food rations for prisoners who exceeded quotas were increased. Those who fulfilled and exceeded the norm (2.5 m³ per day for earthworks) received an increased bread ration (up to 1200 g), a bonus dish (for example, 75-gram pies with cabbage or potatoes), and a cash bonus. Moral incentives were also used: presenting the brigade or phalange with a Red Banner, declaring gratitude, presenting certificates, placing the names of shock workers on the honor board, as well as counting 3 working days for 5 days of work, and for shock workers - “a day in two”. At other times these teams were pitted to compete against each other in surpassing the norms, and promises were made of shortened sentences, food and cash bonuses for the champions. After the successful construction, 12,484 prisoners were freed as reward, and 59,516 prison terms were shortened. 12,300 workers died during the building process, according to the official records, including in 1931 - 1438 (2.24% of the number of workers), in 1932 - 2010 (2.03%), in 1933 - 8870 (10.56%), which was due to a reduction in supplies due to famine in the country and the rush before the completion of construction while Anne Applebaum&#x27;s estimate is 25,000 deaths.

A carefully prepared visit in August 1933 to the White Sea–Baltic Canal may have hidden the worst of the brutality from a group of 120 Russian writers and artists, the so-called Writers Brigade, including Maxim Gorky, Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy, Viktor Shklovsky, and Mikhail Zoshchenko, who compiled a work in praise of the project, the 600-page &quot;The I.V. Stalin White Sea – Baltic Sea Canal&quot; (), published at the end of 1934. Shklovsky visited the White Sea Canal on his own rather than with the group. Gorky, who had previously visited the Solovetski Islands labor camp in 1929 and written about it in the Soviet journal &quot;Our Accomplishments,&quot; organized the White Sea trip, but did not himself join it. Also along on the White Sea trip was Nikolai Pogodin, screenwriter of &quot;Convicts&quot;, a 1936 comedy about the BeltBaltLag labor camp.

It is likely that at least some of the visiting writers were aware of the brutality of camp life. In fact, one of the contributors, Sergei Alymov, was a prisoner at the camp and editor of the camp newspaper &quot;Perekovka&quot; (&quot;Reforging&quot;). Similarly, Aleksandr Avdeenko&#x27;s account of Belomor includes conversations between OGPU chief Semyon Firin and Prince Mirsky that reveal at least some of the writers were aware of its true nature.

==History of usage==
===In 1930s===
After the canal had been completed and opened for navigation, the Belbaltlag (White Sea-Baltic Camp) was reorganized into the White Sea-Baltic Combine (Baltiysko-Belomorsky Kombinat [BBK]), still within the NKVD system, by an order of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of August 17, 1933. The Combine was charged with operating the canal and managing the economic development of the adjacent areas, including 2.8 million hectares of forest lands and the industrial facilities that had been constructed along the route.

A major part of the Combine&#x27;s workforce consisted of 75–85,000 Belbaltlag prisoners. In addition, the Combine included 21 &quot;special settlements&quot; (&quot;spetsposyolok&quot;) with some 30,000 residents, mostly dispossessed farm families transported to Karelia from the USSR&#x27;s warmer regions. In addition to convicts and &quot;special settlers&quot;, the Combine employed about 4,500 free employees and a paramilitary security force. In all, the Combine&#x27;s employees accounted for about 25% of the population of the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.

Until 1936, all financial transactions of the Combine were exempt from taxes and duties.

The BBK led to the development of Belomorsk as a major industrial city. New cities and urban-type settlements developed along the route of the canal, such as Medvezhyegorsk, Segezha, Nadvoitsy. Povenets, which had been demoted from a town to a village in the 1920s, now became a town again, and a large port.

As is discussed further below, during the 1930s a number of smaller naval vessels were transferred from the Baltic to the White Sea to provide warships for the Soviet Northern Naval Flotilla, which became the Northern Fleet in 1937.

===In World War II===

There was no action near the White Sea–Baltic Canal during the Winter War of 1939–1940, when the USSR invaded Finland. With Germany&#x27;s full-scale invasion of the USSR in 1941, supported by Finland in the Continuation War, the canal route became the front line.

On June 23, 1941, the day after the German invasion, 16 Finnish commandos were ferried to the canal by two German Heinkel He 115 seaplanes from Oulujärvi. The commandos were Finnish volunteers recruited by the German Major Schaller, and were equipped with German uniforms and weapons, as the Finnish General Staff wanted no responsibility for the operation. The commandos were to blow up the canal locks, but they failed due to heightened security.

On June 28, the canal was bombed for the first time by the Finnish Air Force, targeting Locks No. 6, 7, 8, and 9, followed the next day by Finnish troops advancing along the Finland-USSR border. The air bombings of the Povenets lock ladder succeeded in interrupting boat traffic on the canal only from June 28 to August 6, and then again from 13 to 24 August 1941. On August 28, the fifth and final bombing raid of the 1941 navigation season took place against Lock No. 7, but it did no damage.

In August, the management of the BBK and most of the 800 canal staff were evacuated from Medvezhyegorsk to Lock No. 19 in Belomorsk, with only 80 left at their stations.

In November, a caravan of passenger vessels evacuating families of Povenets canal workers and residents, along with equipment, froze into the ice of Lake Vygozero. On the night of November 12/13, another boat caravan froze in Zaonezhsky Bay near Megostrov Island, and was later captured by Finnish troops. On December 5, Finnish troops entered Medvezhyegorsk.
On December 6 in a -37 °C frost, Finnish troops captured Povenets, the southern entrance to the BBK.
On the same day, Soviet troops started demolishing canal structures. Lock No. 1 was the first to be blown up.
By the morning of December 8, Locks No 1 to 6, and dams No. 4 and 20 had all been demolished.

At the same time, heavy fighting took place near the Povenets Lock Ladder (Locks No. 1 to 7). The Finns crossed the canal and captured Gabselga village to the east, but after a few days of fighting they were pushed back to the canal&#x27;s western side.

Soviet sappers blew up Lock No. 7 on December 11 after the Red Army had retreated. Once the locks of the Povenets Ladder had been destroyed, water from the watershed lakes poured freely into Lake Onega through Povenets village, which was nearly completely destroyed by the flood. The route of the BBK had become the front line, separating the Finnish troops on the canal&#x27;s western bank from the Soviet forces on its eastern bank. The opposing armies held these positions until June 1944.

===Postwar years===
After Finland left the war in September 1944, the damage to the canal, including the complete destruction of its southern section and the town of Povenets and damage to lighthouses and other structures, was repaired. Rebuilding was completed by July 1946, with navigation through the canal restored on July 28, 1946.

On February 2, 1950, the RSFSR Council of Ministers issued an order for the overhaul and reconstruction of the BBK&#x27;s structures, with gradual electrification of the canal&#x27;s structures and machinery. In 1953, the locks&#x27; staff hired electricians; by 1957, the electrification of the locks of the northern slope was completed; and by 1959 all coastal and floating navigation lights were switched to electric power.

The importance of BBK for the national economy greatly increased after the commissioning of the modern Volga–Baltic Waterway in 1964. Canal capacity and the annual volume of freight traffic increased several-fold.

Another upgrade took place in the 1970s. During the reconstruction, the guaranteed depth of the fairway was increased to 4 meters, and the channel became part of the Unified Deep Water System of European Russia.

==Canal use==

During the first navigation in 1933, 1.143 million tons of cargo and 27.000 passengers were transported through the canal. In 1940 traffic volume was approximately 1 million tons, representing 44% of capacity

Cargo tonnage peaked in 1985, with 7.3 million tonnes transported. Tonnage remained high until 1990, then declined after the fall of the Soviet Union. Usage rose gradually in the 21st century, but remained well below the Soviet-era peak, with just 0.3 million tonnes in 2002.

During the 2007 season, the canal carried 0.4 million tonnes of cargo along with 2,500 passengers. It is now operated by the White Sea and Lake Onega Waterways and Shipping Administration
(Беломорско-Онежское государственное бассейновое управление водных путей и судоходства), which is also responsible for shipping on Lake Onega and in the Belomorsk harbor area (but not in the open waters of the White Sea). The canal was seemingly a small part of the agency&#x27;s overall shipping business, which in 2007 amounted to 4.6 million tonnes and 155,000 passengers.

According to official statistics, a total of 193 million tonnes of cargo was transported over the canal over its first 75 years (1933–2008).

The canal makes it possible to ship heavy and bulky items from Russia&#x27;s industrial centers to the White Sea, and then by sea-going vessels to Siberia&#x27;s northern ports. For example, in the summer of 2007, a large piece of equipment for Rosneft&#x27;s Siberian Vankor Oil Field was delivered by the &quot;Amur-1516&quot; from Dzerzhinsk on the Oka River, via the Volga–Baltic Waterway and the White Sea Canal to Arkhangelsk, and from there by the ocean-going SA-15 class Arctic cargo ship &quot;Kapitan Danilkin&quot; to Dudinka on the Yenisei River. In 2011, heavy equipment for the Sayano-Shushenskaya hydro power plant was shipped from Saint Petersburg via the canal, the Arctic Sea, and the Yenisei River.

===Oil product shipping===
In Soviet times, the canal was used for shipping oil products from refineries on the Volga River to consumers in the Murmansk Oblast and overseas. Russia&#x27;s Volgotanker Company, with a fleet of suitably sized petroleum tankers and ore-bulk-oil carriers, pioneered this route starting August 1970, when &quot;Nefterudovoz-3&quot; delivered a cargo of fuel oil to the White Sea port of Kandalaksha.

After many years of interruption, Volgotanker resumed the canal route in 2003. The company had plans to carry 800,000 tonnes of fuel oil over the canal during 2003, and to increase the volume to in 2004. The fuel was transferred from Volgotanker river tankers to Latvian seagoing tankers at a floating transfer station near the Osinki Island in the Onega Bay on the White Sea, northwest of the port of Onega.

Transfer operations began 24 June 2003, but on 1 September a low-speed collision between Volgotanker&#x27;s &quot;Nefterudovoz-57M&quot; and the Latvian &quot;Zoja-I&quot; during a transfer caused a crack in the &quot;Nefterudovoz&#x27;s&quot; hull, with a subsequent oil spillage estimated at , of which only were recovered. Volgotanker&#x27;s alleged failure to contain the spill resulted in the Arkhangelsk Oblast authorities shutting down the oil transfer operation with only 220,000 tonnes exported. The company was fined and future operations were refused.

===Military use===
Soviet (and later Russian) naval strategists long believed that a well-designed canal system could help establish contact among the separate fleets based on Russia&#x27;s Black Sea, Baltic, Arctic, Pacific, and Caspian coasts. The White Sea Canal was also constructed with this military use in mind,
and early in its history the Northern Fleet&#x27;s first warships sailed along the canal to the White Sea from the Baltic, Before World War II, the canal was used for the transfer of military vessels between the two seas on 17 occasions.

During World War II, in August–September 1941, the canal was used to move a number of submarines from the Baltic Fleet to the White Sea, including submarines K-3, S-101 and S-102, L-22.
Some unfinished submarines from Leningrad&#x27;s Baltic Shipyard and Gorky&#x27;s Krasnoye Sormovo shipyard sailed to the new Sevmash shipyard in Severodvinsk.

Since then, the canal has been regularly used for delivering submarines by transporter dock from the Baltic Shipyard and Krasnoye Sormovo to Sevmash for completion.

===Hydroelectric stations===
The canal system includes five hydroelectric power plants with total production capacity of 240 MW.

==Commemoration==
The canal gave its name to the Belomorkanal Soviet cigarette brand.

There is a monument at Povenets for the prisoners who perished during the construction, and a smaller memorial in Belomorsk near the White Sea end. There was even a comedic play written about the canal by Nikolay Pogodin.

The canal project also gave the Russian language the slang word &quot;&quot;zeka&quot;, &quot;zek&quot;, &quot;z/k&quot;&quot; for &quot;inmate&quot;. In Russian, &quot;inmate&quot;, &quot;incarcerated&quot; is (), usually abbreviated to &quot; in paperwork, and pronounced as &quot; (, &quot;zeh-KA&quot;), which gradually transformed into &quot; and &quot;, &quot;zek&quot; (both pronounced as ). The word is still in colloquial use. Originally the abbreviation stood for (), literally &quot;incarcerated canal-army-man&quot;. The latter term coined in an analogy with the words meaning &quot;member of the Red Army&quot; or (member of a labor army). According to the Soviet account, in 1932 when Anastas Mikoyan visited the &quot;Belomorstroy&quot; construction site, Lazar Kogan asked, &quot;Comrade Mikoyan, what shall we call them? (…) I thought up the word: . What do you think?&quot; Mikoyan approved.

<doc id="529161" wikidata="Q312691" url="?curid=529161" title="Steve Howe">
<text>Stephen James Howe (born 8 April 1947) is an English musician, best known as the guitarist and backing vocalist in the progressive rock band Yes across three stints since 1970. Born in Holloway, North London, Howe developed an interest in the guitar and began to learn the instrument himself at age 12. He embarked on a music career in 1964, first playing in several London-based blues, covers, and psychedelic rock bands for six years, including the Syndicats, Tomorrow, and Bodast.

Upon joining Yes in 1970, Howe&#x27;s blend of acoustic and electric guitar helped shape the sound and direction of the band, leading to more commercial and critical success. Many of their best-known songs were co-written by Howe, and he remained with the band until their initial dissolution in 1981. Howe returned to the group from 1990 to 1992 before returning permanently in 1995. He is the longest-serving member of the band that is currently active.

Howe achieved further success in the 1980s and beyond as a member of the rock bands Asia, GTR, and Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe. He has also had a prolific solo career, releasing 20 solo albums that achieved varied levels of success, and collaborating with artists such as Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Martin Taylor, and Queen. He continues to perform with Yes, his jazz group known as the Steve Howe Trio, and as a solo act. In April 2017, Howe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Yes.

== Early life ==
Howe was born on 8 April 1947 in the north London area of Holloway. He grew up in a middle-class family apartment with three older siblings, brothers Phillip and John, and sister Stella, the son of Cyril Howe, head chef at The Palmerston, a Bishopsgate restaurant, and his wife Ada. Among Howe&#x27;s earliest memories is marching around the home to brass band music that he played on the home stereo. He cites several influences from his parents&#x27; record collection including Les Paul and Tennessee Ernie Ford, and also listened to classical guitar and jazz, citing Barney Kessel as a primary influence. Howe also credited Wes Montgomery and Chet Atkins, whom he first heard in 1959, as a major inspiration. Howe said he took from Atkins, &quot;the idea that one guitarist could play any kind of guitar style.&quot; Howe was also influenced by Bob Dylan, remarking: &quot;I think he brought out the rebel in me, and that rebel wasn&#x27;t somebody who wanted to break things, but the rebel in me wanted to do my thing ... a rebellion against anything other than being me ... he became like a cult hero&quot;. Howe attended Holloway School, and later Barnsbury Boys&#x27; School in Islington, which he left in 1962, aged 15, after failing all his O-levels.

Howe wished to own a guitar at age 10, but his parents did not buy him one until they selected one with him in 1959 at a shop in Kings Cross, London at age 12 for a Christmas present. The model was an F-hole acoustic. Howe would stand by a window at home and mime his playing to passersby while music was playing indoors, until he began to teach himself without formal lessons or learning to read musical notation. The only book he read, he claimed, was &quot;Dance Band Chords for the Guitar&quot; (1946) by Eric Kershaw. After a period of practice which involved listening to records by Bill Haley &amp; the Comets, Howe teamed with school friends and played his first gig at The Swan, a pub in Tottenham, playing a cover of &quot;Frightened City&quot; by the Shadows. He recalled the event as a disaster; the band did not rehearse or tune up, and Howe avoided stage performances for a while as a result. He added: &quot;We were underage. I was painfully shy. I stood on the side of the stage, played my songs, never looked up&quot;. After he left primary school, he wished to become a guitarist and took up several part-time jobs until he wished to become a full-time musician around 18. At age 14, Howe and his friend from Tottenham started a group that played in youth clubs, eventually landing gigs in pubs and ballrooms. At one point, the band secured a short residency at HM Prison Pentonville for two nights a week.

Around 1961, Howe bought a solid body Guyatone, his first electric guitar, which was followed with a Gibson ES-175D in 1964, one of the guitars that he later became most identified with. He spoke about playing the guitar on stage: &quot;No one was playing archtop, hollowbody guitars in a rock band. People laughed at me and thought I was really snooty. To me, it was an object of art, it wasn&#x27;t just a guitar.&quot; During Yes&#x27;s first visit to New York City in 1971, he slept with the guitar as his hotel was situated in a dodgy area and took it to bed &quot;just for safety, I needed to know it was there&quot;. Before he became a full-time musician Howe took up work at a piano factory, followed by a job in a music shop. He left the shop when he began to pick up regular gigs.

== Career ==

=== 1964–1970: Early bands ===
In 1964, the 17-year-old Howe became a member of his first professional band, the North London-based rhythm and blues group the Syndicats that formed the year prior and were produced by Joe Meek. His first of three studio recordings with the band was a rendition of &quot;Maybellene&quot; by Chuck Berry that was released as a single with &quot;True to Me&quot; on its B-side, a song Howe co-wrote with their singer, Tom Ladd. The Syndicats occasionally opened for Chris Farlowe and the Thunderbirds; one night Farlowe asked Howe to step in for Albert Lee at a Wolverhampton gig when Lee was taken ill.

In 1965, Howe left the band and accepted an invitation to join the In Crowd, a soul and covers band who often played in Tottenham and released a rendition of &quot;That&#x27;s How Strong My Love Is&quot; by Otis Redding which went to No. 48 on the UK singles chart in May 1965. The band soon renamed themselves Tomorrow and adopted a psychedelic rock sound, writing more original songs and changing their stage clothes. In 1967, they released two singles: &quot;My White Bicycle&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot;, the latter co-written by Howe.

During the recording of a new single with producer Mark Wirtz, Howe was asked by Wirtz to record some guitar as a session musician, which pleased Howe and felt &quot;thrilled to bits&quot; to take part. The session led to Howe recording a selection of singles for EMI, which included his first song &quot;Mothballs&quot;, also known as &quot;So Bad&quot;, and playing guitar on Keith West&#x27;s single &quot;Excerpt from A Teenage Opera&quot; which went to No. 2 in the UK. Howe and his Tomorrow bandmates also took part in a pie fight scene in the satirical comedy film &quot;Smashing Time&quot; (1967) (where he had one line, &quot;Let&#x27;s do it!&quot;), toured the London club circuit, sharing bills with Pink Floyd, jamming with Jimi Hendrix and playing at the Christmas on Earth concert at Earl&#x27;s Court.

After Tomorrow split in 1967, Howe went on to play on several songs with their singer Keith West, including playing the bass guitar on West&#x27;s &quot;The Kid Was a Killer&quot;, and tracks with guitarist Ronnie Wood and drummer Aynsley Dunbar but neither recording got finished. In 1968, with Howe&#x27;s reputation as a guitarist on the rise, he joined Bodast, a trio which also used the name of Canto for a short period. They signed a recording deal with Tetragrammaton Records and put down a selection of songs in 1969 at Trident Studios for an album with West as producer, but the label went out of business shortly before its release. The label had also promised the group film roles and visits to the US but they never materialised and they disbanded. Howe released the tracks for the proposed album after he obtained the recordings and remixed them himself as &quot;The Bodast Tapes&quot; (1981).

After Bodast split, Howe auditioned with the progressive rock band the Nice as a potential new member, but decided it was not for him, and left the next day. An audition with Jethro Tull followed, but Howe failed to turn up when he learned the guitarist they wanted would not contribute to the songwriting. Howe also had a try out with Atomic Rooster while Carl Palmer was a member but said, &quot;it didn&#x27;t quite gel.&quot; In 1970, Howe toured as a member of American soul singer P. P. Arnold&#x27;s backing band, with future members of Ashton, Gardner and Dyke, which also involved American duo Delaney &amp; Bonnie. The tour made him believe he was set &quot;to really go somewhere in music.&quot;

=== 1970–1981: Joining Yes and start of solo career ===
In April 1970, the rock band Yes sought a new guitarist following the departure of Peter Banks. Howe was invited to a try out session with the group in Fulham, which consisted of Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Bill Bruford, and Tony Kaye; he was successful and became a member in June. By this time, Yes had recorded their second album &quot;Time and a Word&quot; (1970) but it was not yet released. A photograph of Howe with the band was used on its cover for the American release despite his not playing on it. After several gigs, Yes retreated to Devon to rehearse and develop new material for &quot;The Yes Album&quot; (1971). Howe went on to buy Langley Farm, where the group had stayed. Howe&#x27;s proficiency with a wide range of guitars, and his strong contributions to the songwriting, made him a prolific member who was an essential part of the band&#x27;s change in musical direction towards progressive rock. &quot;The Yes Album&quot; and &quot;Fragile&quot; (1971) include his solo acoustic pieces &quot;Clap&quot; and &quot;Mood for a Day&quot;, and writing credits for the popular tracks &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot;, &quot;Starship Trooper&quot;, and &quot;Roundabout&quot;. The latter earned Howe and Anderson a BMI Award for writing the song.

In 1971, Wakeman and Howe had contributed to the recording of Lou Reed&#x27;s self-titled debut album as session musicians, working together for the first time on this occasion. In the summer of 1972, Howe performed one gig with Stone the Crows at the Great Western Festival in Lincoln while they sought a replacement following the death of Leslie Harvey.

To his already-formidable assortment of electric and acoustic guitar sounds, Howe added a unique approach to lap steel guitar in the next album, &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, released in 1972. His penchant for ongoing experimentation helped produce a playing style unique among rock musicians, while the group as a whole took a position as a leading progressive rock band. Following &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, Howe played on &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot;, &quot;Relayer&quot;, &quot;Going for the One&quot; and &quot;Tormato&quot;, with Yes becoming one of the most successful bands of the decade. Two of these five albums achieved platinum certification in the US, and the other three were certified gold.
In 1975, Yes took an extended break for each member to release a solo album. Howe recorded a mixture of solo and group performed tracks for &quot;Beginnings&quot; at Morgan and Advision Studios with producer Eddy Offord and performances from Bruford, Alan White and Patrick Moraz. The album was released in October 1975 by Atlantic Records and reached No. 22 in the UK and No. 63 in the US. His second solo album, &quot;The Steve Howe Album,&quot; was released in November 1979 and included a performance by singer Claire Hamill.
In early 1980, Anderson and Wakeman left the group and were replaced a few weeks later by Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes. 1980&#x27;s &quot;Drama&quot; saw a stylistic change for Yes, incorporating elements of new wave into their progressive rock blend. Howe continued with the band until Yes officially split up in early 1981. Although the group was back together less than a year later, Howe was not included in the new line-up.

=== 1981–1995: Asia, GTR, ABWH, and second Yes run ===
In 1981, Howe teamed with Downes, singer and bassist John Wetton, and drummer Carl Palmer to form the supergroup Asia. Their debut album, &quot;Asia&quot; (1982), was the highest selling album of 1982 in the US, with 4 million copies sold there. Howe is credited as composer on five of its nine tracks. When it came to writing their second album &quot;Alpha&quot; (1982), Howe noticed a sense of staleness and that the songs were too direct and concise which disrupted the group&#x27;s creativity and musical direction. In 1983, after the album&#x27;s release, Howe left the group, citing irreconcilable differences with Wetton; he said later that Wetton, upon his return to the band after leaving it during the tour when the other members confronted him about his increasing mistakes on stage (to be briefly replaced by Greg Lake), told him he was uncomfortable continuing if Howe remained in the band, and Downes and Palmer took Wetton&#x27;s side. Subsequently, Howe performed an acoustic guitar solo on &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; on the 1984 same titled album by the pop group Frankie Goes to Hollywood that Horn produced. He also played on &quot;Industry Standard&quot; (1982) by the Dregs.

In 1985, Howe formed another supergroup, GTR — named after an abbreviation of the word &quot;guitar&quot; — with guitarist Steve Hackett. The idea came from Howe&#x27;s manager and former Yes and Asia manager Brian Lane, who brought the two together as both wished to perform in a band after a period of solo work. They were joined by singer Max Bacon, drummer Jonathan Mover, and bassist Phil Spalding. They recorded one studio album, &quot;GTR&quot;, produced by Downes. Howe noted Hackett and himself made the conscious effort to produce a pop album without &quot;flashy guitar solos&quot; as it was something listeners may not wish to hear and may be classified as self-indulgent. He added: &quot;Musically, we stayed out of each other&#x27;s way and gave each other space. If egos get in the way, nobody wins.&quot; &quot;GTR&quot; was released in July 1986 on Arista Records. It reached No. 11 in the US and was certified gold, and it peaked at No. 41 in the UK. The lead single, &quot;When the Heart Rules the Mind&quot;, went to No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. GTR supported the album with a concert tour in 1986. At its conclusion, Hackett&#x27;s interest in pursuing solo projects led to his departure. In 1987, Howe commissioned Robert Berry as Hackett&#x27;s replacement, and ideas of a new band name included Steve Howe and Friends and Nero and the Trend. After several demos were recorded, the group disbanded after Berry accepted an offer to join Lake and Keith Emerson in 3; without him, Arista Records dropped GTR.

In 1988, the guitar compilation album &quot;Guitar Speak&quot; on I.R.S. Records was released which features Howe&#x27;s track &quot;Sharp on Attack&quot;. The label organised a UK tour named Night of the Guitars with Howe in the line-up, performing &quot;Clap&quot;, &quot;Wurm&quot;, and the all-cast encore. Howe also contributed to &quot;Transportation&quot; (1988), the first solo album by Billy Currie.
Later that year, Jon Anderson invited Howe to take part in a new album he wished to perform with Rick Wakeman and Bill Bruford as a new group, Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe. In 1990, the four joined forces with the 1983–88 line-up of Yes (Chris Squire, Alan White, Trevor Rabin, and Tony Kaye) to contribute songs for the Yes album &quot;Union&quot; (1991). In 1991, he is featured on &quot;Polar Shift: A Benefit for Antarctica&quot;, a benefit jazz and ambient album to the Cousteau Society. At the end of Yes&#x27;s supporting tour for &quot;Union&quot; in 1992, Howe played the guitar and co-produced &quot;Symphonic Music of Yes&quot; (1993), an album of orchestral arrangements of Yes tracks. Howe, Bruford, and Wakeman were not invited to participate in the next Yes album, &quot;Talk&quot; (1994).

During the &quot;Union&quot; tour Howe released his third solo album, &quot;Turbulence&quot;, in 1991 on Relativity Records. In a departure from his earlier two albums, Howe focused on rock instrumentals that feature Currie, Bruford, and drummer Nigel Glockler. The tracks were recorded some time before, but Howe had some difficulty in finding a record label who would release the album as the majority wanted it to include a hit single. Howe recorded a cover of &quot;Classical Gas&quot; with Bruford, but the track was dropped as Howe thought it did not attain the same standard as the rest of the album, which he described as &quot;very real and original, as opposed to commercial&quot;. Howe also contributed a flamenco guitar solo to the 1991 UK number one single &quot;Innuendo&quot; by Queen, something he felt proud to have played on. In 1992, Downes reformed Asia which marked the return of Howe on their album &quot;Aqua&quot; (1992) playing on six of the album&#x27;s 13 tracks, as well as playing on the subsequent tour as a special guest.

Howe&#x27;s fourth solo album, &quot;The Grand Scheme of Things&quot;, was released in August 1993 on Relativity. Howe described the album as &quot;quite colourful but quite personal ... There&#x27;s a lot of floaty sort of ideas—spiritual&quot;. It is his first album to feature his sons Dylan and Virgil on drums and keyboards and piano, respectively. Dylan was planned to only play on a few tracks, but Howe decided to play on the entire album. Upon release, it reached No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top New Age Albums chart. Following the album&#x27;s release, Howe began his first solo tour in 1993 which included dates in the UK and the US, and spawned his first live album, &quot;Not Necessarily Acoustic&quot; (1994). A second tour took place in late 1994 which was documented on his second live release, &quot;Pulling Strings&quot; (1998).

=== 1995–present: Third Yes run, Steve Howe Trio, and final Asia run ===

Howe rejoined Yes for a third time in 1995 for the recording of &quot;Keys to Ascension&quot; and &quot;Keys to Ascension 2&quot;, the two double albums containing both live and studio tracks. Since &quot;Keys to Ascension&quot;, Howe has appeared on all the albums recorded by Yes. Thereafter, over the following five years, the group released &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; in 1997, &quot;The Ladder&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Magnification&quot; in 2001, before going on a five-year hiatus from 2004. Following their hiatus, Yes released &quot;Fly from Here&quot; in 2011 and &quot;Heaven &amp; Earth&quot; in 2014.

On 24 May 1996, Howe received an honorary doctorate in Musical Arts (DMA) from Five Towns College in Dix Hills, New York. Also in 1996 he played with Asia on a song called Ginger meant for &quot;Arena&quot;, but left off the album and released on &quot;Archiva Vol. 1&quot; later that year. He also added his guitar to two of the songs from &quot;Aura&quot;, released in 2001.

Howe&#x27;s solo album &quot;Quantum Guitar&quot; features his son Dylan on drums. In July 1999, Howe released his Bob Dylan covers album &quot;Portraits of Bob Dylan&quot; that features a variety of lead vocalists. This was followed by &quot;Homebrew 2&quot; (2000) as a sequel to his first. When Eagle Records suggested that Howe produce an acoustic guitar album, Howe accepted and recorded &quot;Natural Timbre&quot; (2001) which contains arrangements of three Yes tracks. He considered it a breakthrough in regard to his solo output due to the time required to write and arrange strong solos.

In 2003 Howe released &quot;Elements&quot;, featuring his sons Dylan and Virgil as part of Howe&#x27;s album &quot;Remedy&quot;.

In 2006, Howe rejoined Asia when the original line-up reunited for a 25th anniversary tour. They released &quot;Phoenix&quot; (2008), &quot;Omega&quot; (2010), and &quot;XXX&quot; (2012). In January 2013, Howe announced his decision to leave the band and concentrate on Yes and solo endeavours. He was replaced by Sam Coulson.

In 2007, Howe founded the Steve Howe Trio, a jazz band completed by his son Dylan on drums and Ross Stanley on Hammond organ. The Steve Howe Trio has released two albums: a studio album, &quot;The Haunted Melody&quot; in 2008 and a live album, &quot;Travelling&quot; in 2010.

In March 2015, a two-disc, 33-track collection of Howe&#x27;s solo material was released as &quot;Anthology&quot;. Howe supported its release with a solo tour of the UK in April 2015.

Howe teamed up with his son Virgil for new album &quot;Nexus&quot;, released on 17 November 2017. The album was released by Steve Howe after the death of Virgil Howe in early September 2017; Virgil&#x27;s death resulted in Yes suspending their ongoing Yestival tour i.e. cancelling the seven remaining dates.

Howe released his new studio album &quot;Love Is&quot; in July 2020, his first in nine years.

== Instruments and musicianship ==

Howe became associated with the ES-175 and Gibson from the early days of his career. The In Crowd was originally to be seen performing in Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s influential 1966 film &quot;Blow-Up&quot;, and a prop version of Howe&#x27;s guitar was built for him to smash during that scene. After the band was replaced, following a single day&#x27;s shooting, by the better known Yardbirds, the guitar was kept for Jeff Beck to smash on camera.

When on tour, Howe has insisted on carrying the ES-175 with him however he travels. He has traveled on private jets and by land between shows to avoid having to check it, although he denies a rumour he bought the instrument its own seat on Concorde, noting that the cabin crew were accommodating enough to let him put it in the wardrobe in the passenger compartment. In 2010 a Virgin Atlantic gate clerk insisted Howe check the guitar over his protests; that was the last time it had to go in the hold.

On &quot;The Yes Album&quot;, his first album with the band, Howe used the ES-175 for all his electric parts save the end of &quot;Perpetual Change&quot;, on which he plays an Antoria LG50, to get more of a Fender sound. On the next Yes album, &quot;Fragile&quot;, Howe became interested in experimenting with other Gibson guitars, and ended up playing an ES-5, one of only three commercially released Gibson guitars with three pickups, on every track except &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot;, where he used the ES-175. By the time the band was on tour supporting the album, Gibson offered him an endorsement deal to use their strings in exchange for a free lifetime supply (which Howe appreciated as he restrung his guitars before every show) and a new guitar of his choice, which was the new Gibson ES-345 stereo guitar. He used it for most of the tracks on &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, with a Gibson BR-9 steel guitar and a Danelectro Coral Sitar guitar on some sections.

For &quot;Relayer&quot; Howe used exclusively Fender guitars, primarily a 1955 Telecaster with a Gibson humbucking pickup. On his first solo album, &quot;Beginnings&quot;, he used a banjo guitar for the first time, on &quot;Ram&quot;. Howe played a diverse array of guitars on the next Yes album, &quot;Going for the One&quot;, including, on &quot;Awaken&quot; the album&#x27;s longest track, a Rickenbacker electric 12-string, pedal steel and the Telecaster. He switched to a Stratocaster for &quot;Parallels&quot; and a Gibson L-5 on the fadeout of &quot;Wonderous Stories&quot;, as an homage to Wes Montgomery. By &quot;Drama&quot;, the last album of Yes&#x27;s first iteration, Howe was using whatever type of guitar he thought worked best; he plays all the parts on that album save for the acoustic guitar on &quot;Machine Messiah&quot;, played by Trevor Horn.
Howe would bring multiple guitars on tour with him to re-create the same sound in concert that was on the original recording. In the 2000s, he began using a Line 6 digital guitar in concert which could be programmed to sound like his other guitars.

&quot;I often say that it is only when I actually walk on stage that I fully realise I &quot;am&quot; a guitarist&quot;, Howe wrote in 2021, recalling how he had, like players he saw during his youth in the late 1960s, come to understand that he could feel free to use different guitars for different songs both on stage and in the studio. When writing songs, he has always recorded something, since in his early days he did not write music conventionally, and still has many of the original tapes.

Howe has long been interested in the details of the recording process. &quot;The way a guitar sounds is determined by so many different factors: how you play, what you play, what you play on, what microphone is used and in what position, where and how loud the guitar is in the mix and what frequencies are added or cut during the mastering or pressing.&quot; For that reason he has insisted on producing all his own solo work. &quot;I know what I like and what I don&#x27;t like. My ears can&#x27;t be deceived.&quot; Today he, like Yes and other recording artists, has come to rely on the Pro Tools software package during both production and post-production. He was the band&#x27;s sole producer of &quot;The Quest&quot; (2021) and &quot;Mirror to the Sky&quot; (2023).

== Accolades ==
Howe was voted &quot;Best Overall Guitarist&quot; in &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine five years in a row (1977–1981) and in 1981 was the first rock guitar player inducted into the &quot;Guitar Player&quot; Hall of Fame. The only other two guitarists to win the &quot;Best Overall Guitarist&quot; category for the &quot;Gallery of Greats&quot; are Steve Morse and Eric Johnson.

Gibson Guitar Corporation, the maker of Howe&#x27;s second electric guitar (which he was still playing forty years later), said that Howe &quot;elevated rock guitar into an art form&quot; and &quot;helped define a new style of music known as art rock.&quot; In a tribute to Howe and his personal favourite ES-175 guitar, Gibson produced a Steve Howe Signature ES-175 in 2002.

Howe received a Prog God award at the 2018 Progressive Music Awards in September.

Keith Levene, one of the founder members of the Flowers of Romance, The Clash and Public Image Ltd cited Howe as one of his main influences and &quot;the greatest fucking guitarist in the world&quot;, and progressive rock as a genre he particularly liked.

== Personal life ==
Howe started a relationship with Pat Stebbings in 1968. They married in a register office in Burnt Oak. She gave birth to his son Dylan in 1969, while living in London. They divorced within two years and Howe received custody. Dylan was a member of the Blockheads, is part of the Steve Howe Trio with his father, and toured alongside him as Yes&#x27;s second drummer in 2017.

Howe married his wife Janet Osborne in 1975. They had three children: Virgil, Georgia and Stephanie. Virgil was a member of the rock/R&amp;B band Little Barrie, and died on 11 September 2017.

In 1972, Howe became a vegetarian; since then, he and his wife have embraced the macrobiotic diet. He also avoids taking unnecessary pharmaceutical drugs, preferring alternative medicine and homeopathy. He ate his last meat meal during a North American tour with Yes in 1971.

Howe has practiced Transcendental Meditation daily since adopting it in 1983.

As a result of some accidents and near-accidents, particularly the one that injured then-keyboardist Tony Kaye badly enough to require the cast he is wearing on the cover of &quot;The Yes Album&quot;, in his early days with Yes, when the band traveled to dates around England in a small Rover, Howe has always preferred to travel by personal automobile, either driving himself or, more recently, with an &quot;attentive&quot; personal driver. In 1977 he bought a Bristol 411 Series 5, which he describes as &quot;extremely high-quality ... a truly thrilling car to drive&quot;, although it had to be started with careful attention to the choke. Bristol stored it for him when he was out of the country on tour, and in 1992 he sold it back to them, with on it, at a profit. Since then Howe and his wife have driven, or been driven in, exclusively Mercedes-Benz products.

<text>Ernest Vincent Wright (1872October 7, 1939) was an American writer known for his book &quot;Gadsby&quot;, a 50,000-word novel which, except for four instances, did not use the letter E.
==Biography==

The biographical details of his life are unclear. A 2002 article in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; by Ed Park said he might have been English by birth but was more probably American. The article said he might have served in the navy and that he has been incorrectly called a graduate of MIT. The article says that he attended a vocational high school attached to MIT in 1888 but there is no record that he graduated. Park said rumors that Wright died within hours of &quot;Gadsby&quot; being published are untrue.

In October 1930, Wright approached the &quot;Evening Independent&quot; newspaper and proposed it sponsor a blue lipogram writing competition, with $250 for the winner. In the letter, he boasted of the quality of &quot;Gadsby&quot;. The newspaper declined his offer.

A 2007 post on the &quot;Bookride&quot; blog about rare books says Wright spent five and a half months writing &quot;Gadsby&quot; on a typewriter with the &quot;e&quot; key tied down. According to the unsigned entry at Bookride, a warehouse holding copies of &quot;Gadsby&quot; burned down shortly after the book was printed, destroying &quot;most copies of the ill-fated novel&quot;. The blog post says the book was never reviewed &quot;and only kept alive by the efforts of a few avant-garde French intellos and assorted connoisseurs of the odd, weird and zany&quot;. The book&#x27;s scarcity and oddness has seen copies priced at $4,000 by book dealers.

Wright completed a draft of &quot;Gadsby&quot; in 1936, during a nearly six-month stint at the National Military Home in California. He failed to find a publisher and used a self-publishing press to bring out the book.

Wright previously authored three other books: &quot;The Wonderful Fairies of the Sun&quot; (1896), &quot;The Fairies That Run the World and How They Do It&quot; (1903), and &quot;Thoughts and Reveries of an American Bluejacket&quot; (1918). His humorous poem, &quot;When Father Carves the Duck&quot;, can be found in some anthologies.

<text>Earl V. Shaffer (November 8, 1918 – May 5, 2002), was an American outdoorsman and author known from 1948 as The Crazy One (and eventually as The Original Crazy One) for attempting what became the first publicized claimed hiking trip in a single season over the entire length of the Appalachian Trail (AT). He also worked as a carpenter, a soldier specializing in radar and radio installation, and an antique dealer.

==Biography==
Shaffer was born in rural York, Pennsylvania, which lies approximately twenty miles from the AT, and which he always made his home. In the late 1930s he hiked with a neighbor and close friend, Walter Winemiller, and they made plans to hike the whole of the AT together, after the war that they anticipated the US would eventually enter.

Shaffer enlisted in the army in 1941, was well along in his training at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, and did arduous and risky service as a forward-area radioman in the South Pacific into 1945. His friend Winemiller served in the Pacific Theater as well, and died in the Iwo Jima landings. Shaffer said he did the trail to &quot;walk the war out of my system&quot;.

In 1948, he began the journey from Mt. Oglethorpe, in Georgia (the trail&#x27;s southern end at that time). With sparse equipment that would be regarded as grossly inadequate by most of the through-hikers since – he used worn boots, his army rucksack, and no stove or tent – he reached Mt. Katahdin in Maine, in 124 days, averaging 17 miles per day. Especially after he overcame the skepticism of Appalachian Trail Conference officials (who initially believed his claim of completing the route was obviously fraudulent), his trip raised public awareness of the Trail. He privately published his memoir of the experience; his book, &quot;Walking With Spring&quot; (), reflects the experience of most AT hikers, that the project of making the whole trip in the northward direction (the most common choice), is furthered by a start timed to the weather in the Georgia mountains, and by continually taking advantage of the northward progress of milder weather.

In 1965 Shaffer hiked in 99 days from Maine to Springer Mountain, which had recently replaced Oglethorpe as the Trail&#x27;s Georgia end, becoming the first person to claim a complete trip in each direction. 

In 1982, the Appalachian Trail Conference published Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;Walking With Spring&quot; commercially; it is now called &quot;a classic trail diary&quot;.

In 1998, he claimed another northward through-hike (at age 79) from May 2 to October 21 (six days past official closing of the state park), in 173 days, for the 50th anniversary of his first one, with David Donaldson (known as &quot;The Spirit of &#x27;48&quot;). He later developed his notes from this trip, under the working title &quot;Ode to the Appalachian Trail&quot;, into &quot;The Appalachian Trail: Calling Me Back To The Hills&quot;.

Shaffer was diagnosed with liver cancer, and died of its complications soon after on May 5, 2002. Donaldson, his most recent through-hike companion, was at his bedside.

On June 17, 2011, he was inducted into the Appalachian Trail Hall of Fame at the Appalachian Trail Museum as a charter member.

== Long distance hiking ==
Earl Shaffer is best known as the first person to hike the entire length of the Appalachian Trail in one, continuous journey. Such hikes have come to be known as “thru-hikes” from the words, “hiking through.” 

The original concept of a thru-hike was a continuous journey from one end of a long trail to the other. In the 21st century, however, the requirements with respect to the Appalachian Trail have been relaxed to recognize a hike of the entire Appalachian Trail completed within a single period of 12 months.  This was not the case at the time of Earl’s A.T. thru hikes.

=== 1948: first thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail ===
Prior to 1948, only 7 people had hiked the entire length of the Appalachian Trail—more than 2,000 miles. They had done so by means of “section hiking”, consisting of shorter journeys of a month or a few weeks completed over the course of several years.  Completing a hike of the entire trail in one journey was not considered feasible. Earl, however, believed it was possible, and set out do so on April 4, 1948.

For extraordinary claims, extraordinary evidence is necessary. With this in mind, Earl carefully documented his northbound hike through photography, entries into notebooks kept at trail shelters where he spent the night and, most importantly, detailed entries into the trail journal he called his “Little Black Book.”

The first indication that Earl was well on his way to completing his hike took the form of a postcard sent to the Appalachian Trail Conference (ATC) from Holmes, New York. On the postcard, Earl had sketched a view of the Pinnacles of Dan in Virginia (no longer on the AT) along with the following poem as his message:
&quot;The flowers bloom, the songbirds sing,&quot;

&quot;And though it sun or rain,&quot;

&quot;I walk the mountain tops with spring&quot;

&quot;From Georgia north to Maine.&quot;

Earl’s claim to have hiked the entire Appalachian Trail received careful scrutiny, particularly by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) whose members had the most intimate knowledge of the Trail. After careful consideration of Earl’s documentation and other evidence, he was officially recognized by the ATC as the first person to hike the entire length of the Appalachian Trail without interruption.

Nevertheless, as Philip D&#x27;Anieri has written, subsequent research based on Shaffer&#x27;s trail diary and other sources suggests that Shaffer &quot;may have missed 20 percent or more of the southern AT in his travels, including two car trips that skipped over almost 25 miles of trail.&quot;

=== 1965: first person to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail in both directions ===
After many years of volunteer work related to the Appalachian Trail, Earl undertook a second thru-hike in 1965, starting from Mount Katahdin in Maine and finishing at Springer Mountain, which had recently been designated the Trail&#x27;s southern terminus, replacing Mount Oglethorpe. On completing this hike, Earl Shaffer became the first person known to have completed thru-hikes of the Appalachian Trail in both directions: northbound, from Georgia to Maine, and southbound, from Maine to Georgia.

=== 1998: oldest person to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail ===
Fifty years after the completion of his historic 1948 hike, the mountains called Earl back for a final, northbound thru-hike that established him as the oldest person at the time to have completed a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail. When Earl completed this “50 Anniversary” hike, he was 79 years old and just two weeks short of his 80th birthday. 

Earl’s account of his 1948 hike, Walking with Spring, is published by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.  His final hike is recorded in two books published by the Earl Shaffer Foundation. Appalachian Trail: Calling Me Back to the Hills is a large format, “coffee table size” book that is richly illustrated with photographs of the Appalachian Trail taken by Bart Smith. Ode to the Appalachian Trail is a smaller, more personal account of Earl’s final hike written in a poetic, “ode” format.  It is a limited, numbered printing for which copies are still available.

== Earl Shaffer&#x27;s writing ==
During his groundbreaking first thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail in 1948, Earl Shaffer documented his adventures in vivid detail. Along with his photographs, Earl&#x27;s trail diary was used to confirm that he was the first-ever person to complete the more than 2,000-mile long trail in one continuous journey. Filled with stories of interactions with locals and other hikers, stories of adventure, poetry, and reflections on the stillness he found in nature, this compilation was later published as his best-known book, Walking with Spring. 

The original &quot;Little Black Book&quot; is part of the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s permanent collection at the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. along with many of Earl&#x27;s belongings. Earl&#x27;s 1948 trail journal has been both scanned and transcribed by volunteers and is available to read in its entirety as an online exhibit here.

== Earl Shaffer&#x27;s poetry ==
Before Earl &quot;walked with spring&quot; he documented his entire Army experiences in a poetic journal.  A portion of the journal was written in a fast moving &quot;marching&quot; rhythm with ballad quatrains and end rhyme. It is titled &quot;The Doughboy Odyssey.&quot; In other sections of his journal, he experimented with different poetic forms such as the difficult English and Heroic sonnet forms as well as free verse and the ballad.  He had with him a Bible, rhyming dictionary, and a book of Rudyard Kipling poetry. Through his poetic journal, he not only documented his South Pacific odyssey from island to island as a Signal Corps man, but also specific battles, war machinery, war time news, and island cultures. These poems have been compiled into two volumes.  Before I Walked With Spring includes &quot;The Doughboy Odyssey&quot; which is a ballad review of his entire military career. South of the Sunset specifically describes the war in the Pacific Theater with eyewitness accounts of battles and cultures.

== Appalachian Trail volunteer ==
As teens Earl, along with his neighbor Walter Winemiller and younger brother Evan Shaffer, frequently walked the section of the Appalachian Trail from Caledonia off Route 30 to Dillsburg, PA.  Before Walter entered the US Marines and Earl the US Army, they made a pact to walk the entire Appalachian Trail when they returned home. Pearl Harbor and World War II intervened and only one of the two returned home.

The decision to attempt hiking the entire length of the Appalachian Trail in 1948 was not only the challenge of doing something never done before, but also to honor his friend Walter and &quot;walk off the war&quot; as he described his own war trauma.  Every year thousands of recent war veterans begin their trek on the Appalachian Trail for the same reason. Publicity following Earl Shaffer’s 1948 thru-hike increased public awareness of the Appalachian Trail and brought to it many new hikers.

Following his thru-hike, Earl became active in the work the Appalachian Trail Conference (ATC), which he had joined prior to his hike.  Earl’s contributions as an Appalachian Trail volunteer are recorded in his authorized biography by Donaldson and Forrester, A Grip on the Mane of Life.

== Musician ==
While he concentrated much of his time on writing poetry, Earl Shaffer enjoyed setting many of his poems to song. In his later years, Earl recorded many of these songs while playing his acoustic guitar, steel string guitar and mandolin. Many of his songs are dedicated to his experience and love of the Appalachian Trail, and to his experience as a soldier during WWII. 

His music is compiled into albums that include &quot;Always in April&quot; and &quot;Trail of the Tropic Moon&quot;.

&quot;Always in April&quot; is an album of songs primarily focused on Earl&#x27;s experience on the Appalachian Trail. &quot;Trail of the Tropic Moon&quot; contains music written by Earl while he was stationed in the South Pacific during World War II and after he returned home to Pennsylvania. 

Earl&#x27;s music can be downloaded digitally on the Earl Shaffer Foundation website.

<text>The Saint John River (; Maliseet-Passamaquoddy: &quot;Wolastoq&quot;) is a river flowing within the Dawnland region from headwaters in the Notre Dame Mountains near the Maine-Quebec border through western New Brunswick to the northwest shore of the Bay of Fundy. Eastern Canada&#x27;s longest river, its drainage basin is one of the largest on the east coast at about . This “River of the Good Wave” and its tributary drainage basin formed the territorial countries of the Wolastoqiyik and Passamaquoddy First Nations (named Wolastokuk and Peskotomuhkatik, respectively) prior to European colonization, and it remains a cultural centre of the Wabanaki Confederacy to this day.

The Webster–Ashburton Treaty following the Aroostook War established a border between New Brunswick and Maine following 130 km (80 miles) of the river, while a tributary forms 55 km (35 miles) of the border between Quebec and Maine. Maine communities along the river include Fort Kent, Madawaska, and Van Buren. New Brunswick settlements through which it passes include, moving downstream, Edmundston, Fredericton, Oromocto, and Saint John.

It is regulated by hydro-power dams at Mactaquac, Beechwood, and Grand Falls, New Brunswick.

==Hydronym==
Samuel de Champlain visited the mouth of the river on the feast day of John the Baptist in 1604 and renamed it the Rivière Saint-Jean or Saint John River in English. Many waterways in the system retain their original pre-European names. The Maliseet call it the Wolastoq, meaning &quot;bountiful and good&quot; and seek to restore this name.

==Geography and ecology==
===Upper basin===
The headwaters are in the New England/Acadian forests of Maine and Quebec, including the Southwest, Northwest, and Baker branches, and the Allagash River flowing into New Brunswick at Edmundston where it is joined by the Madawaska River.

===Middle basin===
The middle section runs from the confluence of the Aroostook and Tobique rivers, flowing southeast to Mactaquac Dam. Other tributaries in this section include the Meduxnekeag River. This area is the only place in Atlantic Canada where Appalachian Hardwood Forest is found. Plants rare for the province include wild ginger, black raspberry, wild coffee, maidenhair fern, showy orchis and others. This forest type, also known as the Saint John River Valley Hardwood Forest, once spread of much of the area and has been reduced to less than one percent of the land area because of human activities. This is an area of rolling hills and soils that are the most fertile and heavily farmed in New Brunswick. Soils are fine, loamy, and well-drained glacial tills overlaying limestone and sandstone.

The climate here is drier and warmer than surrounding regions.

===Lower basin===
The lower basin, 140 kilometres (90 miles) to Saint John Harbour on the Bay of Fundy, consisting of lakes, islands, wetlands and a tidal estuary. Tributaries in this section include the Nashwaak and Nerepis rivers and Belleisle Bay.

The final tributary, the Kennebecasis River, is a fjord with a sill, or rise in depth near the mouth of a fjord caused by a terminal moraine. From the Grand Bay (New Brunswick), the waterway becomes narrower and deeper forming a gorge where at the Reversing Falls incoming tide forces the flow of water to reverse against the prevailing current. A wedge of salt water, below a surface covering of fresh water, extends upriver to the 10 metre (30&#x27;) shallows at Oak Point beyond which it cannot advance.

===Formation and hydrology===
The drainage basin is , of which is Maine. The average discharge is . Water flow is lowest in the autumn, and considerably higher than average during the spring freshet at . In early spring, upper sections of the river can experience ice jams causing flooding. In the lower sections in the broader floodplain, flooding may occur during late spring from the volume of water which must make its way through the narrow gorge at the Reversing Falls.

Legally, all of the river downstream of a point between Fredericton and Mactaquac Provincial Park is considered tidal.

The river is mostly calm, except for waterfalls at Grand Falls and at the Beechwood Dam.

=== Flooding ===
With the water flow in the spring being six times the average rate, the valley has always been prone to flooding in the spring. Surface runoff from heavy rainfall is the main cause of flooding, and can be exacerbated by ice jams, high tides, and rapid snowmelt. Floods have been documented for more than 300 years. Flooding has occurred in Edmundston, Grand Falls, Perth-Andover, Hartland, Woodstock, and most severely around Fredericton and Saint John.

Major flooding occurred in 1923, with water 8 metres (26&#x27;) above normal winter low. In 1936, high temperatures quickened snowmelt, and heavy rain raised the water level to 8.9 metres (30&#x27;), about 7.6 metres (25&#x27;) above summer level. Similar circumstances led to the same level of high water in the 1973 flood. Similar major flooding occurred again in 2018 and 2019. Since 2019, flooding has not been as severe.

The severity and frequency of flooding is expected to increase, with climate change. It is predicted that New Brunswick&#x27;s average temperature will increase by 5 C (9°F) by the year 2100, and that precipitation will increase.

==Human history==

At the end of the last glacial period, following the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet about 13,000 years ago, the area was stripped bare of vegetation and soil. By about 10,000 years ago, Paleo-Indians probably occupied what is now New Brunswick. Major disturbances did not begin until the early 1800s with the arrival of large numbers of Europeans.

===First Nations===
The eastern Algonquin languages had different dialects associated with each of the major river systems of New England and the Maritimes; and there was often a linguistic bifurcation between residents of the upper river and those living along the coast and tidal estuary. The Passamaquoddy hunted sea mammals along the northwest shore of the Bay of Fundy while speaking a mutually intelligible dialect with the Wolastoqiyik who were inland hunters along the upper Saint John River and its tributaries. The Wolastoqiyik dealt with freshets by having their village above the floodplain, for example Meductic, while cultivating at a lower elevation where the fields were fertilized by the floodwaters. The Wolastoqiyik identified themselves as inhabitants of the river their canoes traveled for hunting, fishing, and trading. Archaeological evidence is that the Wolastoqiyik had economic and cultural ties with large portions of North America from their country&#x27;s homebase within the Dawnland. Early 16th century fur trade with French fishermen encouraged increased interest in the smaller tributaries and headwaters where scarcity of edible prey kept population density low. After spending the winter hunting and trapping in the interior, the villages of Ouigoudi at the mouth of the river and Aukpaque at the head of navigation were summer gathering places accessible to European fur traders. Fur traders brought European diseases reducing the estimated Wolastoqiyik population to less than a thousand by 1612, but the fur traders&#x27; contribution to the First Nations gene pool would provide some disease resistance. No pure blooded Wolastoqiyik or Passamquoddy survived the 20th century.

===European colonization===
When the Europeans arrived into Wolastokuk, the homeland of the Maliseet Nation and Saint John River basin, they found the locals hunting, gathering, and farming near the banks of the river. Rivalry between English and French fur traders pre-dated colonization of North America. Ouigoudi was defensively fortified as Fort La Tour and Aukpaque became known as Sainte-Anne des Pays-Bas when Acadian colonists settled the lower river valley. The First Nations regarded the fur traders more favorably than later settlers who started taking their land and preventing its historic use for subsistence. European colonists may have used fields and town sites prepared by the natives. Colonization pressure was less severe along the Saint John River where the cold water eddy of the Gulf of Maine kept the growing season shorter than Massachusetts and the Nova Scotia peninsula nearer the warm Gulf Stream. The earliest Acadians were descendants of the French sailors and shipwrights whose focus on fishing, trading, and boat repair rather than agriculture minimized land use conflicts. These Acadians maintained favorable relationships with the First Nations while King Philip&#x27;s War encouraged the Wolastoqiyik to join the Wabanaki Confederacy in military action against New England. French colonists populated the lower river valley as part of Acadia, with Fort Nashwaak in present-day Fredericton, Fort Boishebert at the confluence of the Saint John and Nerepsis rivers. In the French seigneurial system lands were arranged in long, narrow strips, called seigneuries, along the banks of the river. However this was not practical given the seasonal flooding, and the Acadians moved to higher ground. The Wolastoqiyik became steadfast allies of the Acadians through the subsequent French and Indian Wars; and their Saint John River valley became the last holdout of Acadian refusal to declare allegiance to the British monarchy. As the longest river between the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, the Saint John offered one of the best transportation corridors for First Nations refugees to retreat from the English colonization of North America&#x27;s Atlantic coast. About a thousand Wolastoqiyik sheltered a hundred Acadian families retreating up the Saint John to avoid the Acadian Expulsion as the St. John River Campaign killed livestock and burned Acadian settlements as far upstream as Sainte-Anne des Pays-Bas.

===International boundary dispute===

While the upstream Wolastoqiyik and their Acadian allies rejected both Canada and United States sovereignty after English victories in the French and Indian War, many Loyalist refugees from the American Revolutionary War resettled in Saint John at the mouth of the river and in Sainte-Anne des Pays-Bas which was renamed Fredericton. The Saint Croix River formed the Atlantic coastal boundary at the close of the war keeping the Saint John River in Canada while the Penobscot River was allocated to Massachusetts. The Treaty of Paris (1783) defined the eastern boundary of Massachusetts as a line drawn due north from the source of St. Croix River to the drainage divide of the Saint Lawrence River. Persistent hostilities with the Wolastoqiyik had prevented the English treaty signatories from mapping the river headwaters. Aside from ambiguity as to which tributary might be considered the source of the Saint Croix River, the Saint John River does not flow directly south as might have been assumed from knowledge of the better mapped Hudson and Connecticut Rivers. Of greater concern to Canada, however, was discovery of how close the drainage divide was to the south bank of the Saint Lawrence, leaving Canada with a narrow band of unfavorable terrain for construction of a road to connect Atlantic Canada to Quebec through the winter months when ice closed the Saint Lawrence. Canada chose to interpret the treaty&#x27;s intention as keeping the entire Saint John drainage basin under Canadian control. Surviving Acadian and Wolastoqiyik refugees continued to resist British rule while moving upriver to the Acadian Landing Site west of the Saint Croix treaty boundary where they were joined by other Acadian refugees who had fled to Quebec. Large numbers of people began settling the area in the early 1800s, mostly Scottish and Irish, and by the end of the 1850s much of the central Saint John valley had been cleared of old-growth forest for farming. Before the advent of railways, the river was an important trade route, including timber rafting. After the state of Maine obtained independence from Massachusetts in 1820, Maine lumbermen encouraged Acadian refugees to form the independent Republic of Madawaska, and began diverting the Saint John headwaters into the Penobscot River so log driving could float timber harvested in the upper Saint John watershed to Bangor sawmills. These provocations encouraged clarification of the disputed Canada–United States border boundary by the Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842 which allocated the north bank of the Saint John west of the Saint Croix to Canada in exchange for some territory further west.

===Contemporary era===
Today&#x27;s Trans-Canada Highway follows the route of the proposed English road along the north bank of the river through the disputed portion of the drainage. Most of the Saint John drainage on the disputed south bank became Aroostook County, Maine, where the town of Madawaska still shares the Acadian French dialect with Edmundston across the river. Historic isolation has helped preserve the dialect. The Allagash River and Baker Branch of the Saint John River upstream of Madawaska flow through the sparsely populated Maine North Woods. These black spruce forests were a primary source of pulpwood for Maine paper mills through the 20th century. Distance from Maine cities encouraged landowners to employ Quebec lumberjacks. Édouard Lacroix developed innovative transportation methods for the river headwaters including a road from Lac-Frontière, Quebec to build the isolated Eagle Lake and West Branch Railroad in 1927 and the Nine Mile Bridge over the river in 1931.

The lower river has been developed for agriculture and industry. Francophone Quebecers moved into the northern river valley. In the interwar period, many older farms were abandoned due to urbanization, and allowed to reforest. In 1925 a hydroelectric dam was built at Grand Falls, followed in 1955 by the Beechwood Dam and the Mactaquac Dam in 1965. Large reservoirs were created behind the dams. Construction of the latter two dams has caused a severe decline in migrating Atlantic salmon, and resource authorities have developed fish ladders and other measures to try to revive the migration.

The forested areas of the Maine North Woods where the river rises is mostly uninhabited. The Northwest Aroostook, Maine unorganized territory has an area of and a population of 10, or one person for every . Increasing recreational use of the upper river encouraged designation of the Allagash Wilderness Waterway and recognition that the river supports plant communities seldom seen elsewhere. Spring snowmelt causes scouring ice jams along the upper river leaving bedrock covered by thin, patchy acidic soil supporting one of the highest concentrations of rare plants in Maine including Clinton&#x27;s bulrush, Dry Land Sedge, Mistassini primrose, Nantucket shadbush, Northern Painted Cup, and Swamp Birch.

In 2011, the entire watershed was designated the Wolastoq National Historic Site, and is as the traditional territory of the Wolastoqiyik First Nation.

<text>&quot;Sare Jahan se Accha&quot; (Urdu: ; &quot;Sāre Jahāṉ se Acchā&quot;), formally known as &quot;Tarānah-e-Hindi&quot; (Urdu: , &quot;Anthem of the People of Hindustan&quot;), is an Urdu language patriotic song for children written by poet Allama Muhammad Iqbal in the ghazal style of Urdu poetry. The poem was published in the weekly journal &quot;Ittehad&quot; on 16 August 1904. Publicly recited by Iqbal the following year at Government College, Lahore, British India (now in Pakistan) it quickly became an anthem of opposition to the British Raj. The song, an ode to Hindustan—the land comprising present-day Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, was later published in 1924 in the Urdu book Bang-i-Dara.

By 1910, Iqbal&#x27;s worldview had changed to become global and Islamic. In a new song for children, &quot;Tarana-e-Milli,&quot; written in the same metre, he changed the homeland from &quot;Hindustan&quot; to the &quot;whole world.&quot; In 1930, in his presidential address to the Muslim League annual conference in Allahabad, he supported a separate nation-state in the Muslim-majority areas of the subcontinent, an idea that inspired the creation of Pakistan. 

Saare Jahan se Accha has remained popular, but only in India. An abridged version is sung and played there as a patriotic song and as a marching song of the Indian Armed Forces. The most popular musical composition is that of sitar maestro Ravi Shankar.

==Text of poem==

== English translation ==
Better than the entire world, is our India,
We are its nightingales, and it (is) our garden abode
If we are in an alien place, the heart remains in the homeland,
consider us too [to be] right there where our heart would be.
That tallest mountain, that shade-sharer of the sky,
It (is) our sentry, it (is) our watchman
In its lap where frolic thousands of rivers,
Whose vitality makes our garden the envy of Paradise.
O the flowing waters of the Ganges, do you remember that day
When our caravan first disembarked on your waterfront?
Religion does not teach us to bear animosity among ourselves
We are of Hind, our homeland is India.
In a world in which ancient Greece, Egypt, and Rome have all vanished
Our own attributes (name and sign) live on today.
There is something about our existence for it doesn&#x27;t get wiped 
Even though, for centuries, the time-cycle of the world has been our enemy.
Iqbal! We have no confidant in this world
What does any one know of our hidden pain?

==Composition==
Iqbal was a lecturer at the Government College, Lahore at that time, and was invited by a student Lala Har Dayal to preside over a function. Instead of delivering a speech, Iqbal sang &quot;Saare Jahan Se Achcha&quot;. The song, in addition to embodying yearning and attachment to the land of Hindustan, expressed &quot;cultural memory&quot; and had an elegiac quality. In 1905, the 27-year-old Iqbal viewed the future society of the subcontinent as both a pluralistic and composite Hindu-Muslim culture. Later that year he left for Europe for a three-year sojourn that was to transform him into an Islamic philosopher and a visionary of a future Islamic society.

==Iqbal&#x27;s transformation and Tarana-e-Milli==

In 1910, Iqbal wrote another song for children, &quot;Tarana-e-Milli&quot; (Anthem of the Religious Community), which was composed in the same metre and rhyme scheme as &quot;Saare Jahan Se Achcha&quot;, but which renounced much of the sentiment of the earlier song. The sixth stanza of &quot;Saare Jahan Se Achcha&quot; (1904), which is often quoted as proof of Iqbal&#x27;s secular outlook:
contrasted significantly with the first stanza of &quot;Tarana-e-Milli&quot; (1910) reads:
Iqbal&#x27;s world view had now changed; it had become both global and Islamic. Instead of singing of Hindustan, &quot;our homeland,&quot; the new song proclaimed that &quot;our homeland is the whole world.&quot; Two decades later, in his presidential address to the Muslim League annual conference in Allahabad in 1930, he supported a separate nation-state in the Muslim majority areas of the sub-continent, an idea that inspired the creation of Pakistan.

==Popularity in India==
* &quot;Saare Jahan Se Achcha&quot; has remained popular in India for nearly a century. Mahatma Gandhi is said to have sung it over a hundred times when he was imprisoned at Yerawada Jail in Pune in the 1930s.
* In the 1930s and 1940s, it was sung to a slower tune. In 1945, while working in Mumbai with the Indian People&#x27;s Theatre Association (IPTA), the sitarist Pandit Ravi Shankar was asked to compose the music for the K. A. Abbas film &quot;Dharti Ke Lal&quot; and the Chetan Anand movie &quot;Neecha Nagar&quot;. During this time, Ravi Shankar was asked to compose music for the song &quot;Saare Jahan se Accha&quot;. In an interview in 2009 with Shekhar Gupta, Ravi Shankar recounts that he felt that the existing tune was too slow and sad. To give it a more inspiring impact, he set it to a stronger tune which is today the popular tune of this song, which they then tried out as a group song. It was later recorded by the singer Lata Mangeshkar to a 3rd altogether different tune. Stanzas (1), (3), (4), and (6) of the song became an unofficial national song in India, and the Ravi Shankar version was adopted as the official quick march of the Indian Armed Forces. This arrangement as marching tune of this song was made by Antsher Lobo.
* Rakesh Sharma, the first Indian astronaut, employed the first line of the song in 1984 to describe to then prime minister Indira Gandhi how India appeared from outer space. 
* In his inaugural speech, the former prime minister of India Manmohan Singh quoted this poem at his first press conference after becoming the Prime Minister.
* The song is popular in India in schools as a patriotic song, sung during morning assemblies, and as a marching song for the Indian armed forces, played during public events and parades. It is played by the Armed forces Massed Bands each year for the Indian Independence Day, Republic Day and at the culmination of Beating the Retreat.

<text>Arthur Eichengrün (13 August 1867 – 23 December 1949) was a German Jewish chemist, materials scientist, and inventor. He is known for developing the highly successful anti-gonorrhea drug Protargol, the standard treatment for 50 years until the adoption of antibiotics, and for his pioneering contributions in plastics: co-developing (with Theodore Becker) the first soluble cellulose acetate materials in 1903, called &quot;Cellit&quot;, and creating processes for the manufacture of these materials which were influential in the development of injection moulding. During World War I his relatively non-flammable synthetic cellulose acetate lacquers, marketed under the name &quot;Cellon&quot;, were important in the aircraft industry. He contributed to photochemistry by inventing the first process for the production and development of cellulose acetate film, which he patented with Becker.

Eichengrün claimed to have directed the initial synthesis of aspirin in 1897, but his claim has been disputed. For many years Bayer credited Felix Hoffmann, Eichengrün&#x27;s junior, with the invention of aspirin. However, according to some historians the first attribution of the discovery to Hoffmann appears in 1934, and may have reflected anti-Jewish revisionism. Nonetheless, Bayer has denied these claims indicating that Hoffman already figured as the inventor in the American patent of aspirin filed in 1899.

During World War II, Eichengrün was imprisoned in the Theresienstadt concentration camp.

== Life ==
Arthur Eichengrün was born in Aachen as the son of a Jewish cloth merchant and manufacturer. In 1885, he took up studies in chemistry at the University of Aachen, later moved to Berlin, and finally to Erlangen, where he received a doctoral degree in 1890.

In 1896, he joined Bayer, working in the pharmaceutical laboratory. In 1908, he quit Bayer and founded his own pharmaceutical factory, the &quot;Cellon-Werke&quot; in Berlin. His company was &quot;Aryanized&quot; by the Nazis in 1938.

In 1943, he was arrested and sentenced to four months in prison for having failed to include the word &quot;Israel&quot; in his name in a letter to a Reich official (Nazi law required Jewish men to be identified as such, as they required Jewish women to identify as &quot;Sarah&quot;.). In May 1944, he was arrested again on the same charge and deported to the concentration camp Theresienstadt, where he spent 14 months until the end of World War II in Europe, escaping death.

After the liberation, he returned to Berlin, but moved to Bad Wiessee in Bavaria in 1948, where he died the following year at the age of 82.

== Work ==
=== Aspirin ===
Eichengrün has made his name through numerous inventions, such as processes for synthesizing chemical compounds. Aside from Aspirin, Eichengrün held 47 patents.
Bayer&#x27;s official story credits Felix Hoffmann, a young Bayer chemist, with the invention of aspirin in 1897. Impure acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, the active compound of aspirin) had been synthesized already in 1853 by French chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt; the 1897 process developed at Bayer was the first to produce pure ASA that could be used for medical purposes.

Due to the rise of the Nazis in Germany, Eichengrün was unable to object when Hoffmann first made the claim that &quot;he&quot; (Hoffman) invented aspirin, in the footnote of a 1934 German Encyclopedia. Hoffmann&#x27;s claim was once widely accepted, but many historians now consider it to be discredited. Eichengrün first claimed to have invented aspirin in a 1944 letter from Theresienstadt concentration camp, addressed to IG Farben (of which Bayer was a part), where he cited his many contributions to the company (which was highly influential in the concentration camps), including the invention of aspirin, as reasons for why he should be released.

Five years later, Arthur Eichengrün published a paper in Pharmazie in 1949, where he explained that he had instructed Hoffmann to synthesise acetylsalicylic acid and that the latter had done so without knowing the purpose of the work. The paper elucidated how he planned and directed the synthesis of aspirin along with the synthesis of several related compounds, describing these events in detail. He also claimed to be responsible for aspirin&#x27;s initial surreptitious clinical testing. Finally, he explained that Hoffmann&#x27;s role was restricted to the initial lab synthesis using his (Eichengrün&#x27;s) process and nothing more.

Eichengrün&#x27;s account was largely ignored by historians and chemists until 1999, when Walter Sneader of the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow re-examined the case and came to the conclusion that indeed Eichengrün&#x27;s account was convincing and correct and that Eichengrün deserved credit for the invention of aspirin. Bayer denied this in a press release, asserting that the invention of aspirin was due to Hoffmann.

;Evidence supporting Eichengrün&#x27;s claims to the invention
Walter Sneader based his claims that Eichengrün both invented the process for synthesizing aspirin and oversaw its clinical testing on old and newly released archived materials, including letters, patents, and lab work. He found that Hoffmann was not credited with inventing the process for synthesizing Aspirin in any documents prior to 1934, 37 years after its initial synthesis. Further he found reason to doubt the footnote&#x27;s credibility, not just for being published during the &quot;Aryanization&quot; period of Nazi Germany, but for its inaccurate claims about the testing of salicylic acid derivates other than acetyl ester. The vague reference did not specify which derivatives were tested, but claimed they had been discovered earlier but had been synthesized for &quot;other purposes&quot;. No indication was given of what the others were, but in 1899 Heinrich Dreser, head of the experimental pharmacology laboratory at Elberfeld, named them in a publication as propionyl, butyryl, valeryl, and benzoyl salicylic acids. He further alluded to these derivatives in 1907 and again in 1918. However, the assertion that these salicylic acid derivates had been synthesized for non-therapeutic reasons is demonstrably false. Hoffmann&#x27;s colleague Otto Bonhoeffer (who also worked under Eichengrün) had been awarded a US and UK patent in 1900 for several of these compounds. The patents indicate that the derivatives were prepared for the exact purpose of finding a salicylic acid derivative with therapeutic value. Sneader concluded that because of this error the 1934 footnote is unreliable.

However Bayer dismissed Sneader claims asserting Hoffman invention of the Aspirin. According to Bayer, Hoffmann and Eichengrün were colleagues of equal standing at Bayer, not in a hierarchical relationship. This undermines Sneader&#x27;s claim that Hoffmann worked under Eichengrün&#x27;s direction. Numerous documents, including Hoffmann&#x27;s laboratory journal entry from August 10, 1897, explicitly record his synthesis of ASA, providing clear evidence of his role in this pivotal discovery. Additionally, Hoffmann is recognized as the inventor in the American patent for ASA, filed in 1899. Notably, Eichengrün never contested this acknowledgment during his tenure at Bayer, further solidifying Hoffmann’s claim to the invention. Eichengrün’s assertions lack timely credibility, as he did not claim credit for the synthesis until 1949—more than 50 years after Hoffmann&#x27;s documented work. This delay raises questions about the validity of his late claims to authorship. Furthermore, the narrative suggesting that Eichengrün&#x27;s Jewish background led to the suppression of his contributions lacks substantive evidence. Throughout his career, Eichengrün was a successful inventor with numerous patents and never demanded recognition for ASA during his time at Bayer.

=== Protargol ===
In 1897, protargol, a silver salt of a protein mixture, developed by Eichengrün at Bayer, was introduced as a new drug against gonorrhea. Protargol stayed in use until sulfa drugs and then antibiotics became available in the 1940s.

=== Plastics ===
In 1903, Eichengrün co-developed the first soluble form of cellulose acetate with Theodore Becker. He developed processes for the manufacture of cellulose acetate materials and devoted the rest of his life to the technical and economic development of plastics, lacquers, enamels, and artificial fibers based on cellulose acetate. During World War I his relatively non-inflammable synthetic cellulose acetate lacquers were important in the aircraft industry. He also pioneered the influential technique of injection moulding. In 1904, he created and patented the first safety film with Becker, (cellulose diacetate) from a process they devised in 1901 for the direct acetylation of cellulose at a low temperature to prevent its degradation, which permitted the degree of acetylation to be controlled, thereby avoiding total conversion to its triacetate. Cellit was a stable, non-brittle cellulose acetate polymer that could be dissolved in acetone for further processing. It was used to manufacture cellulose diacetate cinematographic film, which Eastman Kodak and the Pathé Frères began to use in 1909. Cellulose acetate film became the standard in the 1950s, preferred over the highly flammable and unstable film stock produced from Nitrocellulose.

<doc id="529208" wikidata="Q3502586" url="?curid=529208" title="Hapa">
<text>Hapa () is a Hawaiian word for someone of multiracial ancestry. In Hawaii, the word refers to any person of mixed ethnic heritage, regardless of the specific mixture. The term is used for any multiracial person of partial East Asian, Southeast Asian, or Pacific Islander mixture in California. In what can be characterized as trans-cultural diffusion or the wave model, this latter usage has also spread to Massachusetts, Ohio, and Oregon. Both uses are concurrent.

== Historical and Hawaiian usage ==
The word &quot;hapa&quot; entered the Hawaiian language in the early 1800s, with the arrival of Christian missionaries who instituted a Hawaiian alphabet and developed curriculum for schools. It is a transliteration of the English word &quot;half,&quot; but quickly came to mean &quot;part,&quot; which could be combined with numbers to form fractions. For example, &quot;hapalua&quot; is half, &quot;hapahā&quot; is one-fourth, and &quot;hapanui&quot; means majority.

In Hawaii, the term can be used in conjunction with other Hawaiian racial and ethnic descriptors to specify a particular racial or ethnic mixture. An example of this is &quot;hapa haole&quot; (part European/White).

Pukui states that the original meaning of the word &quot;haole&quot; was &quot;foreigner.&quot; Therefore, all non-Hawaiians can be called &quot;haole&quot;. In practical terms, however, the term is used as a racial description for whites, with the specific exclusion of Portuguese. Portuguese are traditionally considered to be a separate race in Hawaii.

&quot;Hapa-haole&quot; also is the name of a type of Hawaiian music in which the tune, styling, and/or subject matter is Hawaiian, but the lyrics are partly, mostly, or entirely in English. Many &quot;hapa-haole&quot; songs had their musical roots in the Western tradition, and the lyrics were in some combination of English and Hawaiian; these songs first gained popularity outside the Territory of Hawaii beginning in 1912–1915, and include titles such as &quot;My Little Grass Shack in Kealakekua&quot; and &quot;Sweet Leilani.&quot;

&quot;Hapa haole&quot; is also used for Hawaiian-language hula songs that are partly in English, thus disqualifying them as &quot;authentic&quot; Hawaiian hula in some venues such as the Merrie Monarch Festival.

== Controversy ==
Some see the use of the term to refer to mixed Asian people without any connections to Hawaii as a misappropriation of Hawaiian culture, but there are &quot;kamaāina&quot; and &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; who see it as hypocritical to protest anyone using what was originally taken from another culture to begin with.

Still others take a stronger stand in discouraging its usage and misuse as they consider the term to be vulgar and racist.

However, the term, unlike other words referring to mixed-race people, has never been a derogatory term when it is used in its original Hawaiian context, although there is some debate about appropriate usage outside this context. As Wei Ming Dariotis states, Hapa&#x27; was chosen because it was the only word we could find that did not really cause us pain. It is not any of the Asian words for mixed Asian people that contain negative connotations either literally (e.g. &#x27;children of the dust,&#x27; &#x27;mixed animal&#x27;) or by association (Eurasian).&quot;

== In popular culture ==
In 2010, a film called &quot;One Big Hapa Family&quot; was released about Japanese Canadians.

<text>CODCO is a Canadian comedy troupe from Newfoundland, best known for a sketch comedy series which aired on CBC Television from 1988 to 1993.

Founded as a theatrical revue in 1973, &quot;CODCO&quot; drew on the province&#x27;s cultural history of self-deprecating &quot;Newfie&quot; humour, frequently focusing on the cod fishing industry. The troupe&#x27;s name was an abbreviation of &quot;Cod Company&quot;.

Following the end of &quot;CODCO&quot;, two of the troupe&#x27;s core members and an occasional guest collaborator, as well as some of their sketch characters, moved on to the new series &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;.

==Roots==
In 1973, Tommy Sexton and Diane Olsen wrote a comedic show about Canadian stereotypes of Newfoundlanders, &quot;Cod on a Stick&quot;. Originally launched in Toronto, the cast consisted of Sexton, Olsen, Greg Malone, Cathy Jones, Mary Walsh and Paul Sametz. The show subsequently opened in St. John&#x27;s, with Scott Strong replacing Sametz, and then toured the province with Robert Joy replacing Strong. When the show was taped by the National Film Board in 1974, Andy Jones appeared in the cast as well.

Sexton, Olsen, Malone, Cathy Jones, Andy Jones, Walsh and Joy subsequently performed in the show &quot;Sickness, Death and Beyond the Grave&quot; in 1974. In 1975, all except Malone, who was on a brief sabbatical to study at the Toronto Dance Theatre, appeared in &quot;What Do You Want to See the Harbour For, Anyway?&quot;; later that year, Malone rewrote the show as &quot;Das Capital&quot;.

In the fall of that year, the troupe compiled bits from their earlier shows for a week-long performance in Philadelphia, which was titled &quot;Philadelphia: Somewhere on the Hungry Coast of Newfoundland&quot;. That show was also taped for broadcast on CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Peep Show&quot;, as &quot;Festering Forefathers and Running Sons&quot;.

Joy and Olsen left the troupe in 1976.

Mike Jones, Cathy and Andy Jones&#x27; brother, was not a performing member of the troupe, but was associated with them as a frequent director of their stage shows.

Over the next number of years, the troupe&#x27;s members only rarely worked together as CODCO, but often collaborated with each other individually on various projects, including the film &quot;The Adventure of Faustus Bidgood&quot; and the television series &quot;The Root Seller&quot;, &quot;The Wonderful Grand Band&quot; and &quot;The S and M Comic Book&quot;. Greg Thomey and Paul Steffler also frequently collaborated with the CODCO members on various projects.

==TV series==
In 1986, Walsh, Sexton, Malone, Cathy Jones and Andy Jones reunited as CODCO for a benefit show in St. John&#x27;s. Sexton and Malone had just completed the successful and popular &quot;S and M Comic Book&quot; series of CBC Television specials, and the CBC was interested in developing further projects with the duo — after the success of the CODCO reunion show, the troupe decided to work on a CODCO series.

&quot;CODCO&quot; began production in 1986, and debuted on the CBC in 1988. Although not regular contributors, Thomey and Joy sometimes appeared on &quot;CODCO&quot; as guest performers.

For most of its run, &quot;CODCO&quot; aired as the latter half of a one-hour sketch comedy block, immediately following &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;.

==Segments and characters==
&quot;CODCO&quot; shared several characteristics with &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, including the presence of openly gay members and the use of drag — although where &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; often revelled in absurdist humour, &quot;CODCO&quot;&#x27;s sketches were typically based around social commentary and satire, often with a strongly political edge. Their sketches were also strongly reflective of the troupe&#x27;s background on the stage, sometimes playing more as humorous character or scene studies than as conventional sketch comedy.

Recurring characters included the Friday Night Girls (Walsh and Jones), a homely, dateless pair of female friends whose Friday nights rarely consisted of anything more exciting than riding the Metrobus; Dakey Dunn (Walsh), an unexpectedly insightful macho lout; Frank Arsenpuffin (Andy Jones), a hapless talk show host faced with a succession of horrifying guests; Marg at the Mental (Sexton), a patient in a psychiatric hospital; and Jerome and Duncan (Sexton and Malone), a flamboyant pair of gay lawyers. Thomey sometimes appeared on the show as Newfoundland separatist Jerry Boyle, a character he would later reprise on &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;.

Another recurring sketch, House of Budgell, was essentially an ongoing soap opera set in a boarding house. Wake of the Week focused on the Furlong sisters, a pair of elderly spinsters who regularly crashed funeral wakes, while The Byrd Family focused on a family of hardened criminals. Another of the show&#x27;s most famous sketches parodied Canadian literary icon &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;; instead of Prince Edward Island, Anne lived in a dreary Newfoundland fishing outport called Green Gut. In another, a former Newfoundlander now resident in Toronto brought his girlfriend home to meet his parents; the sketch escalated to the brink of violence as the parents tried to explain why the Mi&#x27;kmaq, not Newfoundlanders, were responsible for the extinction of the Beothuk.

Malone performed a number of celebrity impersonations, including Margaret Thatcher and Canadian television journalist Barbara Frum, while Sexton did recurring impersonations of Barbara Walters and Tammy Faye Bakker. In one famous sketch, Malone as Frum moderated a debate between Jones as a gay teacher who had been fired from his job for testing HIV-positive and Sexton as Clarabelle Otterhead, the homophobic president of a lobby group called Citizens Outraged by Weird Sex (or COWS). The troupe also parodied the conventions of television news through mock local newscasts; in one such sketch, a racist anchor character loudly blamed Africa for AIDS: &quot;It&#x27;s all your fault, it&#x27;s all your fault. Nah nah nah nah nah nah. You&#x27;re black, you&#x27;re black, take your dirty bugs back. You&#x27;re screwing green monkeys and giving it to our junkies. We give you all our foreign aid, and all we gets back is AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.&quot;

Parody music videos were also a frequent feature of the show. In a transparent spoof of Quebec pop idol Mitsou, Cathy Jones played &quot;Jansu&quot;, a shallow, self-promoting pop singer who tried to be topical with lyrics such as &quot;it&#x27;s a political world/so separate your garbage!&quot;. Sexton parodied body image as Dusty Springroll, who sang an ode to the fashionability of bulimia. Figures such as Anne Murray and Bruce Cockburn were parodied in commercials for compilation albums with satirical lyrics set to the melodies of real songs by the artists, while another sketch was set in a café holding a Leonard Cohen impersonation contest.

==The end of &quot;CODCO&quot;==
In 1991, a sketch was filmed for &quot;CODCO&quot; called the &quot;Pleasant Irish Priests in Conversation&quot;, which involved three Roman Catholic priests discussing their sexual experiences; it was a reference to the then-ongoing Mount Cashel Orphanage child abuse controversy. The CBC refused to air the sketch. As a result, Andy Jones quit the show in protest. The series carried on for two more years before it came to a close in 1993. Ironically, the CBC subsequently aired &quot;Pleasant Irish Priests&quot; in a &quot;CODCO Uncensored&quot; special just a few months after the regular series ended.

Following the end of CODCO, Walsh and Cathy Jones worked with Thomey and Rick Mercer to create &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;. Several CODCO characters, including Dakey Dunn and Jerry Boyle, were carried over to the new series.

Sexton died in 1993 of complications from AIDS.

Malone ran as a New Democratic Party in the St. John&#x27;s West by-election in 2000, losing narrowly to Loyola Hearn. Malone ran as the Green party candidate for the riding of Avalon for the 2019 federal election.

<text>The WinChip series is a discontinued low-power Socket 7-based x86 processor that was designed by Centaur Technology and marketed by its parent company IDT.

==Overview==
===Design===
The design of the WinChip was quite different from other processors of the time. Instead of a large gate count and die area, IDT, using its experience from the RISC processor market, created a small and electrically efficient processor similar to the 80486, because of its single pipeline and in-order execution microarchitecture. It was of much simpler design than its Socket 7 competitors, such as AMD K5/K6, which were superscalar and based on dynamic translation to buffered micro-operations with advanced instruction reordering (out of order execution).

===Use===
WinChip was, in general, designed to perform well with popular applications that did few floating point calculations, if any. This included operating systems of the time and the majority of software used in businesses. It was also designed to be a drop-in replacement for the more complex, and thus more expensive, processors it was competing with. This allowed IDT/Centaur to take advantage of an established system platform (Intel&#x27;s Socket 7).

===Later developments===
WinChip 2, an update of C6, retained the simple in-order execution pipeline of its predecessor, but added dual MMX/3DNow! processing units that could operate in superscalar execution. This made it the only non-AMD CPU on Socket 7 to support 3DNow! instructions. WinChip 2A added fractional multipliers and adopted a 100 MHz front side bus to improve memory access and L2 cache performance. It also adopted a performance rating nomenclature instead of reporting the real clock speed, similar to contemporary AMD and Cyrix processors.

Another revision, the WinChip 2B, was also planned. This featured a die shrink to 0.25 μm, but was only shipped in limited numbers.

A third model, the WinChip 3, was planned as well. This was meant to receive a doubled L1 cache, but the W3 CPU never made it to market.

===Performance===
Although the small die size and low power-usage made the processor notably inexpensive to manufacture, it never gained much market share. WinChip C6 was a competitor to the Intel Pentium and Pentium MMX, Cyrix 6x86, and AMD K5/K6. It performed adequately, but only in applications that used little floating point math. Its floating point performance was simply well below that of the Pentium and K6, being even slower than the Cyrix 6x86.

==Decline==
The industry&#x27;s move away from Socket 7 and the release of the Intel Celeron processor signalled the end of the WinChip. In 1999, the Centaur Technology division of IDT was sold to VIA. Although VIA branded the processors as &quot;Cyrix&quot;, the company initially used technology similar to the WinChip in its Cyrix III line.

== Data ==
===Winchip C6 (0.35 μm)===
* All models supported MMX
* The 88 mm die was made using a 0.35 micron 4-layer metal CMOS technology.
* The 64 Kib L1 Cache of the WinChip C6 used a 32 KB 2-way set associative code cache and a 32 KB 2-way set associative data cache.
===WinChip 2 (0.35 μm)===

* All models supported MMX and 3DNow!
* The 95 mm die was made using a 0.35 micron 5-layer metal CMOS technology.
* The 64 Kib L1 Cache of the WinChip 2 used a 32 KB 2-way set associative code cache and a 32 KB 4-way set associative data cache.
===WinChip 2A (0.35 μm)===
* All models supported MMX and 3DNow!
* The 95 mm die was made using a 0.35 micron 5-layer metal CMOS technology.
* The 64 Kib L1 Cache of the WinChip 2A used a 32 KB 2-way set associative code cache and a 32 KB 4-way set associative data cache.
===WinChip 2B (0.25 μm)===

* All models supported MMX and 3DNow!
* The 58 mm die was made using a 0.25 micron 5-layer metal CMOS technology.
* The 64 Kib L1 Cache of the WinChip 2B used a 32 KB 2-way set associative code cache and a 32 KB 4-way set associative data cache.
* Dual-voltage CPU: while the processor core operates at 2.8 V, the external input/output (I/O) voltages remain 3.3 V for backwards compatibility.
===WinChip 3 (0.25 μm)===
* All models supported MMX and 3DNow!
* The 75 mm die was made using a 0.25 micron 5-layer metal CMOS technology.
* The 128 Kib L1 Cache of the WinChip 3 used a 64 KB 2-way set associative code cache and a 64 KB 4-way set associative data cache.
* Dual-voltage CPU: while the processor core operates at 2.8 volts, the external input/output (I/O) voltages remain 3.3 volts for backwards compatibility.

<text>The Kane Gang are an English pop trio formed in Seaham in 1982. The group comprised Martin Brammer, Paul Woods and Dave Brewis. They scored several UK and US hits in the 1980s. Named alluding to the movie &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, the trio recorded for the record label Kitchenware, which was also home to Prefab Sprout. The group announced a 40th anniversary comeback tour, of three dates, on 14 August 2024.

==History==
Vocalists Martin Brammer (born 13 May 1957, Seaham, County Durham) and Paul Woods, with multi-instrumentalist Dave Brewis, formed the trio in 1982, after meeting while in small local bands, and signed to Kitchenware Records, which led to a deal with London Records in 1984. 

Their debut album, &quot;The Bad and Lowdown World of the Kane Gang&quot; (released in the US as &quot;Lowdown&quot;), was released the following year. It spawned two UK hit singles: &quot;Closest Thing to Heaven&quot; (No. 12) and a cover of the Staples Singers&#x27; &quot;Respect Yourself&quot; (No. 21). The latter was also a hit in Australia, reaching No. 19. The album was co-produced by Pete Wingfield, and featured P. P. Arnold and Sam Brown as backing vocalists.Two tracks &quot;Gun Law&quot; and &quot;Take This Train&quot; were produced by Robin Millar.

The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Miracle&quot;, also co-produced by Pete Wingfield, was released in 1987 and spawned two US hit singles: &quot;Motortown&quot; (No. 36 US / No. 45 UK) and another cover – this time of Dennis Edwards&#x27; &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Any Further&quot; (No. 64 US / No. 52 UK). The latter hit No. 1 on the US Dance Charts.

Woods left the band in 1991 to attempt a solo career. Woods and Brewis also worked on songs leading to releasing an album &quot;Infiniti Drive&quot; as Autoleisureland in 2022, named after a 1970s Sunderland car-themed retail unit, and continue to write and record.

It was announced that the Kane Gang would reunite for a gig at Sunderland&#x27;s The Fire Station music venue on 2 November 2024, plus London Dingwall&#x27;s 24th January 2025, and Glasgow St. Luke&#x27;s 25th February 2025.

==Other works==
The Kane Gang performed the music for the &quot;Ooh Gary Davies... On Your Radio&quot; jingle for BBC Radio 1. As was the fashion around that time, bands would adapt songs to provide the radio station with a jingle, and embed the hook of the track in the public&#x27;s consciousness. The Gary Davies jingle was based on their track &quot;Smalltown Creed&quot; (from the LP &quot;The Bad and Lowdown World of the Kane Gang&quot;). The jingle was also adapted for John Peel, David Jensen, and Richard Skinner, amongst others. The same track was used as the basis for the theme tune of long-running Children&#x27;s BBC television programme &quot;Byker Grove&quot;, which launched the careers of Ant &amp; Dec (as PJ &amp; Duncan) and Donna Air. The Kane Gang song &quot;Gun Law&quot; was used in the soundtrack to an episode (Cuba Libre s3 ep14) of Miami Vice in the 1980s.

<doc id="529223" wikidata="Q13416824" url="?curid=529223" title="Flying officer">
<text>Flying officer (Fg Offr or F/O) is a junior officer rank used by some air forces, with origins from the Royal Air Force. The rank is used by air forces of many countries that have historical British influence.

Flying officer is immediately senior to pilot officer and immediately below flight lieutenant. It is usually equivalent to the rank of sub-lieutenant in the navy and of the rank of lieutenant in other services.

The equivalent rank in the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force was &quot;section officer&quot;.

==Canada==

The rank was used in the Royal Canadian Air Force until the 1968 unification of the Canadian Forces, when army-type rank titles were adopted. Canadian flying officers then became lieutenants. In official Canadian French usage, the rank title was .

== United Kingdom ==
===Origins===
The term &quot;flying officer&quot; was originally used in the Royal Flying Corps as a flying appointment for junior officers, not a rank.

On 1 April 1918, the newly created RAF adopted its officer rank titles from the British Army, with Royal Naval Air Service sub-lieutenants (entitled flight sub-lieutenants) and Royal Flying Corps lieutenants becoming lieutenants in the RAF. However, with the creation of the RAF&#x27;s own rank structure in August 1919, RAF lieutenants were re-titled flying officers, a rank which has been in continuous use ever since.

===Usage===
The rank title does not imply that an officer in the rank of flying officer flies. Some flying officers are aircrew, but many are ground branch officers. Amongst the ground branches some flying officers have command of flights.

In the RAF, aircrew and engineer officers are commissioned directly into the rank of flying officer, while ground branches are commissioned as pilot officers for an initial period of six months. Time served in the rank of flying officer varies depending on branch before automatic promotion to flight lieutenant; aircrew and BEng qualified officers will serve for a period of 2½ years, MEng qualified engineers for 1½ years, and all other ground branches for 3½ years. A graduate entrant who has an MEng but is joining a ground branch other than engineer will serve 3½ years as a flying officer – the early promotion for MEng engineers is designed as a recruitment incentive. The starting salary for a flying officer is £39,671 per year.

In many cases the rank of flying officer is the first rank an air force officer holds after successful completion of his professional training. A flying officer might serve as a pilot in training, an adjutant, a security officer or an administrative officer and is typically given charge of personnel and/or resources. By the time aviators have completed their training, they will have served their 2½ years and typically join their frontline squadrons as flight lieutenants.

===Insignia===
The rank insignia consists of one narrow blue band on slightly wider black band. This is worn on both the lower sleeves of the tunic or on the shoulders of the flying suit or the casual uniform. The rank insignia on the mess uniform is similar to the naval pattern, being one band of gold running around each cuff but without the Royal Navy&#x27;s loop.

<text>The College of Idaho (C of I) is a private liberal arts college in Caldwell, Idaho. Founded in 1891 by Rev. William Judson Boone as a Presbyterian college, it is the state&#x27;s oldest private liberal arts college and has an enrollment of over 1,000 students. 

The college offers 30 undergraduate programs to earn a B.A., with select programs offering the opportunity to earn either a B.A. or a B.S. degree. The college also offers 4 graduate degrees in the fields of Sports Administration, Medical Science, Physician Assistant Studies, and Education. While previously utilizing the &quot;PEAK&quot; curriculum, in which students could earn one major and three minors in the span of four years, starting in the 2025-2026 academic year, the college began using the &quot;Do More in Four&quot; curriculum, in which students only have to attend classes for four days a week, with four, four credit classes per semester (as compared to the standard five, three credit classes), and the opportunity to earn an undergraduate and graduate degree in four years.

The college&#x27;s alumni include eight Rhodes Scholars, three governors, four professional football players, and one professional baseball player. The college has been ranked #4 in the most recent Best Colleges Rankings by U.S. News for the Regional Colleges West category, tying with the Oregon Institute of Technology, as well as #15 in social mobility and #7 in the best value colleges categories. The college has also been recognized by The Princeton Review as one of the &quot;Best in the West,&quot; one of the &quot;best and most interesting colleges,&quot; and one of the best colleges in the United States for &quot;Baccalaureate Colleges with Diverse Fields.&quot;

==History==

The college was conceived in 1884 when the Presbyterian Church&#x27;s Wood River Presbytery, meeting in Shoshone, formed a commission to examine the possibility of establishing a Presbyterian college somewhere in the Idaho Territory. The commission found support for such a venture and in 1890 the Presbytery accepted an offer from a group of Caldwell citizens led by William Judson Boone, to locate the institution in that community.

The college was founded in 1891 by Dr. Rev. William Judson Boone with the support of the Wood River Presbytery. The college first opened its doors to students on October 7, 1891. Nineteen students showed up at The College of Idaho for the first classes in 1891. The first classes were held downtown in the Caldwell Presbyterian Church. A year later the college moved into its own downtown building before moving to its present site on the east side of town in 1910 when Henry and Carrie Blatchley donated of land. Sterry Hall, a classroom and administration building, and Finney Hall, the first residence hall, were built that year. Two years later Voorhees residence hall was built, which would be the second of five total residents halls.

In 1893, it was incorporated under the laws of the State of Idaho and placed in the hands of a self-perpetuating board of trustees. Dr. Boone served as president of the college for 45 years until his death in 1936.
In 1991, the college&#x27;s board of trustees unanimously voted to change its name to Albertson College of Idaho to honor alumnus and long-time donor Joe Albertson and his wife Kathryn The couple, who founded one of the country&#x27;s largest supermarket chains, Albertson&#x27;s Inc., met in a chemistry class at C of I and were generous benefactors of the college. At the time of the name change, the enrollment was 

On October 10, 2007, college president Bob Hoover announced that the name would revert to The College of Idaho, with the mutual agreement of the J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Foundation, to promote acceptance and gain financial backing from alumni who were unhappy about the original name change. This coincided with a donation by the foundation to the college.

===Curriculum===

==== PEAK (2010-2025) ====
PEAK was the college&#x27;s unique undergraduate curriculum. It was intended to allow students to graduate with an academic major and three minors in four years or two majors and two minors if they choose. The curriculum was implemented in the fall of 2010. It was made up of four different peaks: humanities &amp; fine arts, social sciences &amp; history, natural sciences &amp; mathematics, and professional foundations &amp; enhancement. Each student under this curriculum is required to major in one of the four peaks, while minoring in the other three allowing a broad base of study with limited general education requirements. 

==== Do More in Four (2025-present) ====

Due to economic hardship in the mid-2000&#x27;s, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a 15% decrease in college students in 2025. In addition, the rising costs of inflation (up to 19.1%) and financial hardship by the college, the increasing trend by students and belief by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities that it is better to graduate in three years rather than four, and the decreasing trust in higher education (70% in 2014 v. 36% in 2024), the college found it necessary to revamp their curriculum in order to involve with the changing economical, political, 
and educational climates.
As the result of discussion with donors, the college&#x27;s board, faculty, and students, the &quot;Do More in Four&quot; curriculum was introduced. This curriculum differs wildly from the previous PEAK curriculum, as it requires more general education classes in what is called &quot;Coyote Core.&quot; This curriculum emphasizes a four-day school week, from Monday through Thursday, where Fridays should be utilized for meetings with professors and internships; four, four credit classes per semester, as opposed to the previous five classes per semester, worth three credits each; and, the opportunity, in select fields, to complete both a Bachelor&#x27;s and Master&#x27;s degree in the span of four years, while retaining undergraduate scholarships and grants.

===Academic calendar===
The academic calendar provides opportunities for experimental as well as conventional approaches to learning. During the fall and spring terms traditionally formatted courses are offered over a twelve-week term. Between the fall and spring terms, a four-week winter session, named &quot;J-term&quot;, is offered. Classes often stress experimentation, innovation, creative teaching, and imaginative learning using tutorials, seminars, or independent research methods. These classes are often described as a full semester&#x27;s worth of class into one month.

==Student life==
The college has more than 50 student clubs and organizations, with an active student government, the Associated Students of The College of Idaho (ASCI) emphasize diversity in cultures, and strong intramural and club sports programs. Intramural sports include: basketball, soccer, softball, rugby, volleyball and flag football.

The college&#x27;s Outdoor Program takes advantage of Idaho&#x27;s geography and include backpacking, hiking, fly fishing, camping, winter camping, snowshoeing, kayaking, rafting, rock climbing, backcountry skiing, inner tubing, and stargazing. The Outdoor Program leads week-long trips during the breaks between terms and after midterms.

The college has one fraternity (Sigma Chi) and two sororities (Kappa Alpha Theta and Kappa Kappa Gamma), but has historically had more.

==Athletics==
The College of Idaho athletic teams are called the Coyotes (or Yotes). The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Cascade Collegiate Conference (CCC) for most of its sports since the 1993–94 academic year; while its football team competes in the Frontier Conference, its men&#x27;s lacrosse team competes in the Pacific Northwest Collegiate Lacrosse League (PNCLL), its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s skiing competes in the Northwest Collegiate Ski Conference (NWCSC) of the United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association (USCSA), and its competitive swimming team competes as an Independent.

CofI competes in 20 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, skiing, soccer, swimming &amp; diving and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, skiing, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

===Football===
In 2014, The College of Idaho re-instated its football program after a 37-year hiatus. The program is led by head coach Mike Moroski, who has posted a record of 53-38 since taking over the program and was voted the 2019 Frontier Conference Coach of the Year. From 2019 to 2022, the Yotes have posted a record of 29–7 and have won a at least a share of the Frontier Conference each year. The Yotes even posted their longest winning streak in school history from 2018 to 2019 (17 games). Even so, the Yotes have only reached the NAIA playoffs once in those four years (2019). In 2019, the Yotes posted their best record of 11–1 and achieved their highest rank in program history at #5 in the NAIA postseason poll. Since 2014, the Yotes have had a total of 8 All-Americans, 56 all-conference selections, and 26 NAIA All-Academic selections. In 2022, the Yotes split the conference title with rival Carroll College and finished the season ranked 18th in the nation after posting an 8–2 record.

===Mascot===

The Coyote is the school&#x27;s mascot, and CofI teams are often referred to as the &quot;Yotes.&quot;

===Accomplishments===
Since 2011, CofI student-athletes have won 23 national championships. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ski teams have won 48 individual and team national championships while competing in the NWCSC of the USCSA. The college&#x27;s track and cross country teams have won 13 individual and relay national titles. The men&#x27;s baseball team has qualified for postseason play every year since 1987, winning the NAIA national championship in 1998. The men&#x27;s basketball team won the 1996 NAIA Division II national championship. In 2014, the CofI football team ranked No. 2 in the NAIA for attendance with more than 4,500 fans per game. The men&#x27;s lacrosse team has also won back to back PNCLL D II conference championships, in 2018 and 2019.

All 19 of the College of Idaho&#x27;s NAIA teams were honored as NAIA Scholar Team for 2008–2009 season. Each team maintained an average GPA of at least 3.0. This set an all-time NAIA record for number of Scholar Teams in one season. CofI student-athletes continue to earn high marks in the class room and are among the annual leaders in scholar-athlete and academic All-America honorees.

During 2019–2021, the College of Idaho football team won three straight Frontier Conference championships in the NAIA. This includes the unprecedented &quot;COVID&quot; season in the spring of 2021 where the &quot;Yotes&quot; played just four games.

In 2023, the College of Idaho&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team, under head coach Colby Blaine, won its second NAIA national championship, defeating Indiana Tech 73–71 in Kansas City, Missouri. The 2022–2023 team went 36–1 and 22–0 in Cascade Conference play, winning 36 straight games after losing its opening game of the season to Arizona Christian. In Fall 2023, the women&#x27;s cross country team won its first national championship and the first NAIA women&#x27;s team national championship in school history. Head coach Dominic Bolin was named the 2023 NAIA Women&#x27;s Cross Country Coach of the Year. It was just the second year of Bolin&#x27;s head coaching tenure.

===National Championships===
==Orma J. Smith Museum of Natural History==

The College of Idaho houses the Orma J. Smith Museum of Natural History in William Judson Boone Science Hall. It is the only natural history museum for southwestern Idaho, southeastern Oregon, and northern Nevada. The natural history museum serves three main purposes: to support the educational programs at The College of Idaho, to provide a resource to the community, and to house resources for scientific research.

Orma J. Smith taught chemistry, zoology, and geology in the early 1900s. A small museum was established in the 1930s to house his collections but was closed in 1963. It was reopened in 1976 in the basement of Boone Hall, driven by the need to house collections from the College of Idaho expeditions led by Dr. Robert Bratz and the current director, William H. Clark.

Since the ‘70s, the Museum has been staffed primarily by volunteers, many the College of Idaho alums, and students. The first Saturday is dedicated to Museum Workdays, where the museum is open for work with Museum staff. A monthly education seminar takes place at noon on Workdays.

The museum is a repository for some very large regional collections.

The students in the Gipson Honors Program utilize the museum every year for a first semester project, writing research papers which are supposed to offer a unique perspective on one item in the extensive collections.

==The Whittenberger Planetarium==
The College of Idaho houses the Whittenberger Planetarium in the William Judson Boone Science Hall. The planetarium was built in 1970 and provides educational programming to student groups and the public. 

==Archives==
The personal papers of Robert E. Smylie and the legislative papers of former senator Steve Symms are located at the college. The Steunenberg Papers, detailing Idaho&#x27;s Trial of the Century, were recently donated to the Archives.

Idaho&#x27;s Gem and Mineral Collection is located at the Orma J. Smith Natural History Museum at the college.

==Community involvement==
Jewett Auditorium hosts the Caldwell Fine Arts Series which was founded in 1961 as a co-operative effort between the college and community leaders to present cultural events. The performances sponsored by the Caldwell Fine Arts Series have included a wide variety of disciplines: solo artists, chamber music, orchestra, theater, opera, ballet, ethnic dance and jazz. Jewett Auditorium was built to house a three manual pipe organ. The interior of the auditorium seats 850 people. The building was completed in 1962.

<text>A renal corpuscle (or Malpighian body) is the blood-filtering component of the nephron of the kidney. It consists of a glomerulus - a tuft of capillaries composed of endothelial cells - and a glomerular capsule known as Bowman&#x27;s capsule.

==Structure==

The renal corpuscle is composed of two structures, the glomerulus and the Bowman&#x27;s capsule. The glomerulus is a small tuft of capillaries containing two cell types. Endothelial cells, which have large fenestrae, are not covered by diaphragms. Mesangial cells are modified smooth muscle cells that lie between the capillaries. They regulate blood flow by their contractile activity and secrete extracellular matrix, prostaglandins, and cytokines. Mesangial cells also have phagocytic activity, removing proteins and other molecules trapped in the glomerular basement membrane or filtration barrier.

The Bowman&#x27;s capsule has an outer parietal layer composed of simple squamous epithelium. The visceral layer, composed of modified simple squamous epithelium, is lined by podocytes, podocyte foot processes (pedicels), that wrap around glomerular capillaries. These pedicels interdigitate with pedicels of adjacent podocytes forming filtration slits.

There are two poles in the renal corpuscle, a vascular pole and a tubular pole. The vascular pole is a location of the glomerulus. At the vascular pole, the afferent arterioles and efferent arterioles enter and leave the glomerulus in the Bowman&#x27;s capsule. The tubular pole is at the other end opposite to the vascular pole. At the tubular pole, the proximal convoluted tubule arises.

==Function==
The renal corpuscle acts to filter blood. Fluid from blood in the glomerulus is collected in the Bowman&#x27;s capsule to form &quot;glomerular filtrate&quot;, which is then further processed along the nephron to form urine. It does this via a filtration barrier. The renal corpuscle filtration barrier is composed of: the fenestrated endothelium of glomerular capillaries, the fused basal lamina of endothelial cells and podocytes, and the filtration slits of the podocytes. This barrier permits passage of water, ions, and small molecules from the bloodstream into Bowman&#x27;s space (the space between the visceral and parietal layers). Large and/or negatively charged proteins are prevented from passing into Bowman&#x27;s space, thus retaining these proteins in the circulation. The basal lamina is composed of 3 layers: lamina rara externa, lamina densa, and lamina rara interna. The lamina rara externa is adjacent to the podocyte processes. The lamina densa is the central layer consisting of type IV collagen and laminin. This layer acts as a selective macromolecular filter, preventing the passage of large protein molecules into Bowman&#x27;s space. The lamina rara interna is adjacent to endothelial cells. This layer contains heparan sulfate, a negatively charged glycosaminoglycan that contributes to the electrostatic barrier of the glomerular filter.

==Eponym==
A renal corpuscle is also known as a &quot;Malpighian corpuscle&quot;, named after Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694), an Italian physician and biologist. This name is no longer widely used, probably to avoid confusion with a Malpighian corpuscle in the spleen.

<text>In analytical chemistry, Karl Fischer titration is a classic titration method that uses coulometric or volumetric titration to determine trace amounts of water in a sample. It was invented in 1935 by the German chemist Karl Fischer. Today, the titration is done with an automated Karl Fischer titrator.

== Chemical principle ==
The elementary reaction responsible for water quantification in the Karl Fischer titration is oxidation of sulfur dioxide () with iodine:

: H2O + SO2 + I2 → SO3 + 2 HI

This elementary reaction consumes exactly one molar equivalent of water vs. iodine. Iodine is added to the solution until it is present in excess, marking the end point of the titration, which can be detected by potentiometry. The reaction is run in an alcohol solution containing a base, which consumes the sulfur trioxide and hydroiodic acid produced.

==Coulometric titration==
The main compartment of the titration cell contains the anode solution plus the analyte. The anode solution consists of an alcohol (ROH), a base (B), sulfur dioxide () and KI. Typical alcohols that may be used include ethanol, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, or methanol, sometimes referred to as &quot;Karl Fischer grade&quot;. A common base is imidazole.

The titration cell also consists of a smaller compartment with a cathode immersed in the anode solution of the main compartment. The two compartments are separated by an ion-permeable membrane.

The Pt anode generates from the KI when current is provided through the electric circuit. The net reaction as shown below is oxidation of by . One mole of is consumed for each mole of . In other words, 2 moles of electrons are consumed per mole of water.

:2 I− → I2 + 2 e−
:B·I2 + B·SO2 + B + H2O → 2 BH+I− + BSO3
:BSO3 + ROH → BHRSO4

The end point is detected most commonly by a bipotentiometric titration method. A second pair of Pt electrodes is immersed in the anode solution. The detector circuit maintains a constant current between the two detector electrodes during titration. Prior to the equivalence point, the solution contains but little . At the equivalence point, excess appears and an abrupt voltage drop marks the end point. The amount of charge needed to generate I2 and reach the end point can then be used to calculate the amount of water in the original sample.

==Volumetric titration==
The volumetric titration is based on the same principles as the coulometric titration, except that the anode solution above now is used as the titrant solution. The titrant consists of an alcohol (ROH), base (B), and a known concentration of . Pyridine has been used as the base in this case.

One mole of is consumed for each mole of . The titration reaction proceeds as above, and the end point may be detected by a bipotentiometric method as described above.

==Disadvantages and advantages==

The popularity of the Karl Fischer titration (henceforth referred to as KF) is due in large part to several practical advantages that it holds over other methods of moisture determination, such as accuracy, speed and selectivity.

KF is selective for water, because the titration reaction itself consumes water. In contrast, measurement of mass loss on drying will detect the loss of &quot;any&quot; volatile substance. However, the strong redox chemistry () means that redox-active sample constituents may react with the reagents. For this reason, KF is unsuitable for solutions containing e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide.

KF has a high accuracy and precision, typically within 1% of available water, e.g. 3.00% appears as 2.97–3.03%. Although KF is a destructive analysis, the sample quantity is small and is typically limited by the accuracy of weighing. For example, in order to obtain an accuracy of 1% using a scale with the typical accuracy of 0.2 mg, the sample must contain 20 mg water, which is e.g. 200 mg for a sample with 10% water. For coulometers, the measuring range is from 1–5 ppm to about 5%. Volumetric KF readily measures samples up to 100%, but requires impractically large amounts of sample for analytes with less than 0.05% water. The KF response is linear. Therefore, single-point calibration using a calibrated 1% water standard is sufficient and no calibration curves are necessary.

Little sample preparation is needed: a liquid sample can usually be directly injected using a syringe. The analysis is typically complete within a minute. However, KF suffers from an error called &quot;drift&quot;, which is an apparent water input that can confuse the measurement. The glass walls of the vessel adsorb water, and if any water leaks into the cell, the slow release of water into the titration solution can continue for a long time. Therefore, before measurement, it is necessary to carefully dry the vessel and run a 10–30-minute &quot;dry run&quot; in order to calculate the rate of drift. The drift is then subtracted from the result.

KF is suitable for measuring liquids and, with special equipment, gases. The major disadvantage with solids is that the water has to be accessible and easily brought into methanol solution. Many common substances, especially foods such as chocolate, release water slowly and with difficulty, requiring additional efforts to reliably bring the total water content into contact with the Karl Fischer reagents. For example, a high-shear mixer may be installed to the cell in order to break the sample. KF has problems with compounds with strong binding to water, as in water of hydration, for example with lithium chloride, so KF is unsuitable for the special solvent LiCl/DMAc.

KF is suitable for automation. Generally, KF is conducted using a separate KF titrator, or for volumetric titration, a KF titration cell installed into a general-purpose titrator. There are also oven attachments that can be used for materials that have problems being analyzed normally in the cell. The important aspect about the oven attachment is that the material doesn&#x27;t decompose into water when heated to release the water. The oven attachment also supports automation of samples.

Using volumetric titration with visual detection of a titration endpoint is also possible with coloured samples by UV/VIS spectrophotometric detection.

<doc id="529249" wikidata="Q6782328" url="?curid=529249" title="Masaharu Morimoto">
<text>is a Japanese chef, best known as an Iron Chef on the Japanese TV cooking show &quot;Iron Chef&quot; and its spinoff &quot;Iron Chef America&quot;. He is also known for his unique style of presenting food.

== Career ==
Morimoto was born in Hiroshima, where he received practical training in sushi and traditional Kaiseki cuisine; he opened his own restaurant in that city in 1980. Influenced by Western cooking styles, he decided to sell his restaurant in 1985 to travel around the United States. His travels further influenced his fusion style of cuisine. He established himself in New York City and worked in some of Manhattan&#x27;s prestigious restaurants, including the dining area for Sony Corporation&#x27;s executive staff and visiting VIPs, the Sony Club, where he was executive chef, and at the exclusive Japanese restaurant &quot;Nobu&quot;, where he was head chef.
While at Nobu he got his start on the &quot;Iron Chef&quot; television show. Several months after the weekly run of &quot;Iron Chef&quot; ended in 1999, he left Nobu to collaborate with Starr Restaurants and opening his own &quot;Morimoto&quot; restaurant in Philadelphia in 2001. His first expansion was a Morimoto restaurant in Chelsea in New York City. Architecturally, this New York City restaurant has exposed concrete, a signature element of architect Tadao Ando, who designed the restaurant in collaboration with Goto Design Group and structural engineers Leslie E. Robertson Associates. Mr. Morimoto has restaurants in Mumbai and New Delhi called &quot;Wasabi&quot; and has opened multiple locations of &quot;Morimoto&quot; around the world. 

In July 2010, he opened a Napa Valley location of his flagship &quot;Morimoto&quot; restaurant, followed in October 2010 by a Waikiki, Hawaii location, and a Maui location in October 2013. Morimoto Waikiki closed in December 2016. In 2018 the chef announced two new ventures for the neighborhood, branches of his &quot;Morimoto Asia&quot; and &quot;Momosan&quot; chains.

In November 2012, Morimoto opened &quot;Tribeca Canvas&quot; in New York&#x27;s Tribeca neighborhood, featuring Asian-inflected takes on American comfort food. After a string of bad reviews and flagging business, he closed the restaurant for a revamp in August 2013, and that October opened the restaurant &quot;Bisutoro&quot;, with his interpretations of classic bistro fare, in the same space. &quot;Bisutoro&quot; suffered the same fate as its predecessor and closed in January 2014.

Morimoto also owns &quot;Morimoto XEX&quot; in Tokyo, a spin on his Morimoto concept with separate Teppanyaki and sushi floors. Morimoto XEX received a Michelin star in the 2008 Tokyo Michelin Guide. Morimoto appeared as an Iron Chef in &quot;Iron Chef America&quot;, a spinoff from the original Japanese &quot;Iron Chef&quot; series, and in its spinoffs &quot;The Next Iron Chef&quot; and &quot;Iron Chef Gauntlet&quot;. Chef Morimoto has also developed a line of specialty beers in collaboration with Rogue Ales of Newport, Oregon, consisting of the Imperial Pilsner, Soba Ale, and Black Obi Soba Ale.

In 2005, he partnered with businessmen Paul Ardaji,  a credited Film Producer (ALI) starring Will Smith, and Paul Ardaji, Jr., through Ardaji Restaurant Ventures, LLC in an aborted Asian bistro venture which was to be called PauliMotos Asian Bistro. The relationship between the Ardajis and the Iron Chef broke down when the Ardajis could not raise the $20.0 million necessary capital to open 11 locations throughout the United States. 

In September 2015, Morimoto opened the Pan-Asian restaurant &quot;Morimoto Asia&quot; at Disney Springs in Walt Disney World in Florida. 

In April 2016, Morimoto opened the restaurant &quot;Momosan Ramen &amp; Sake&quot; on Lexington Ave. in New York City.

In October 2016, Morimoto opened &quot;Morimoto Las Vegas&quot; located inside the MGM Grand hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.

In October 2021, Morimoto opened the restaurant &quot;Momosan Ramen Boston&quot; inside The Hub on Causeway in Boston, Massachusetts.

In December 2023, Morimoto by Sea, a culinary venture by Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto, opened its doors on Holland America Line&#x27;s Nieuw Amsterdam. The restaurant specializes in modern pan-Asian cuisine, offering a selection of vegetarian and vegan options. Notable menu items include Morimoto Fresh Tuna Pizza, Tempura Calamari Salad, Angry Lobster Pad Thai, and Ishiyaki Buri Bop, which is cooked tableside on a hot stone.

== &quot;Iron Chef&quot; ==
Morimoto&#x27;s official win/loss/tie record on &quot;Iron Chef&quot; is 16-7-1.

Morimoto&#x27;s costume on &quot;Iron Chef&quot; was silver with red trim and a picture on the back of Japanese and American flags tied together in a sheaf. On &quot;Iron Chef America&quot;, he donned the standard blue Iron Chef outfit with white trim and a patch of the Japanese flag on his sleeve (the other Iron Chefs having flags from their respective countries on their sleeves). In his professional life, to distinguish himself from his on-screen persona, Morimoto wears (purely aesthetic) glasses.

Unlike his predecessor, Koumei Nakamura, Morimoto&#x27;s introduction as an Iron Chef came with little fanfare, debuting the week following Nakamura&#x27;s retirement battle against Yukio Hattori. Morimoto was chosen based on his style of cooking, which seemed to border on fusion cuisine, as well as his international experience.

Morimoto was initially reluctant to accept the title of Iron Chef, but accepted fearing the show would hire someone else. Originally, he had planned to incorporate some of the dishes that he had routinely prepared in New York for &quot;Iron Chef&quot;, but discovered that previous challengers and Iron Chefs had already made similar dishes. He would become known as the Iron Chef whose dishes always seemed to come out of left field—a famous example is his Bell Pepper Sushi in a sushi battle in 1999. He would usually have a bottle of Coca-Cola to drink while cooking on the show; on one occasion he combined it with nattō to fashion a dessert dish.

Morimoto competed in the first sushi battle in Kitchen Stadium on June 18, 1999, against challenger Keiji Nakazawa. There were five theme ingredients for the battle: tuna, eggs, Kohada (Japanese Gizzard Shad), Anago, and Kanpyō. Both chefs were given time before the battle to properly prepare the sushi rice (&quot;sushi-meshi)&quot;. Morimoto defeated Nakazawa.

Morimoto is also memorable for being the target of Tadamichi Ohta, a vice-chairman of the Japanese Culinary Association and head of the notorious &quot;Ohta Faction&quot; of Japanese chefs, themselves noted for targeting all the Japanese Iron Chefs starting with Michiba. The Ohta faction lost three battles with Chef Morimoto before finally winning one when challenger Seiya Masahara defeated Morimoto in the anglerfish battle. The Ohta faction was not happy with just one win, however, and they sent in challenger Yusuke Yamashita, a sake specialist, to battle Morimoto. At that time, Morimoto had lost two straight battles and no Iron Chef had ever lost three in a row. The theme ingredient for that battle was cod roe and the battle ended in a tie. The overtime theme ingredient was scallions and Morimoto was able to defeat Yamashita in a 3–1 decision.

In his first battle with Bobby Flay in New York, battle rock crab, Morimoto famously declared that Flay was &quot;not a chef&quot; because Flay stood up on his chopping board after completing his dishes. Morimoto went on to defeat Flay in the New York Battle, the results of which Flay contested believing he was &quot;given inferior cooking space and equipment&quot; and because he had cut himself in addition to suffering several electric shocks during the battle. This led to the two chefs competing once again in Japan during the 21st Century Battles. Morimoto lost to Flay in the re-match with Japanese lobster as the theme ingredient. Nevertheless, Flay would become an Iron Chef along with Morimoto in the American spin-off, &quot;Iron Chef America&quot;. The two would face off a third time with Morimoto defeating Flay during the Holiday Ice Battle in November 2009. A fourth battle between the two would take place in an episode which aired on January 1, 2012, with Flay and Marcela Valladolid defeating Morimoto and teammate Andrew Zimmern in a sea whistle salmon battle by a narrow 51-50 margin.

==&quot;Iron Chef America&quot;==

Morimoto and Hiroyuki Sakai were the only two original Iron Chefs to appear on &quot;Iron Chef America: Battle of the Masters&quot;. On this Food Network special series, he lost two battles with American Iron Chefs Mario Batali and Wolfgang Puck, but won a tag team battle along with partner Bobby Flay against Batali and Sakai.

When &quot;Iron Chef America&quot; was greenlighted as a regular series, it moved from Los Angeles to New York. When Puck was unavailable, Morimoto came on board to replace him. His voice is usually dubbed by American voiceover personality Joe Cipriano during the judgment phase of the show; during the battle, his use of English is not dubbed, but conversations with his sous-chefs in Japanese are subtitled. In 2007, Morimoto&#x27;s third year at &quot;Iron Chef America&quot;, he published his first cookbook, &quot;Morimoto: The Art of New Japanese Cooking&quot;.

As of October 2021, Morimoto&#x27;s win/loss/tie record on &quot;Iron Chef America&quot; is 26–17–1, and his total combined record for both Iron Chef series is 41–21–2.

Morimoto opened a restaurant in the Boca Raton Resort &amp; Club in late 2008. He has spent time there ensuring a successful launch of the restaurant.

In &quot;The Next Iron Chef&quot;, Iron Chef Morimoto has made several appearances as a guest judge.

==Other television appearances==
In 1999, Masaharu Morimoto and Rokusaburo Michiba went to Indonesia appearing on &quot;Resep Oke Rudy&quot; broadcast on RCTI and Media Partner Tabloid Wanita Indonesia.

In the 2010 season of American version of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, Iron Chef Morimoto made an appearance on the show teaching the contestants how to make sushi. The contestants then had to replicate his dish.

In Season 8 of &quot;Top Chef&quot;, Iron Chef Morimoto was the Guest Judge. Each finalist had to make a &quot;Last Supper&quot; for one of the judges. Finalist Antonia Lofaso prepared a traditional Japanese meal for Morimoto, consisting of miso soup and a sashimi bento. He returned to &quot;Top Chef&quot; in Season 21 as the final group of chefs participated on a cruise line. Before the group of them had to prepare an 8-course fish meal together, Morimoto cooked them dinner. He discussed his work in creating a global fish program with Holland America Line. He serves as an ambassador.

In 2016 he participated as a guest in the 6th edition of &quot;Masterchef Italia.&quot; His task was to evaluate the contestants in cooking a selection of Japanese dishes.

Morimoto has made guest appearances as himself on the CBS television series &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;, which is filmed on location in Hawaii. He made his first appearance in the season 1 episode &quot;Ma Ke Kahakai&quot;.

In Season 10 of &quot;MasterChef&quot;, Iron Chef Morimoto was the Guest Judge for the King of the Crabs battle.

Morimoto made a guest appearance in the 4 Million Subscriber Special of &quot;Binging with Babish&quot;, in which he prepared fugu for Andrew Rea&#x27;s &quot;death sandwich.&quot;

In November 2022, The Roku Channel ordered a cooking competition series featuring the chef, &quot;Morimoto&#x27;s Sushi Master&quot;. The series is hosted by Lyrica Okano, with Morimoto serving as the lead judge. In September 2023, Roku renewed the series for a second season.

<doc id="529255" wikidata="Q7588828" url="?curid=529255" title="St. John's River (California)">
<text>The St. John&#x27;s River is a distributary of the Kaweah River in the San Joaquin Valley of California in the United States. The river begins at a diversion dam at McKay&#x27;s Point, about a mile west of Lemon Cove. The distributary flows west along the north side of the city of Visalia, where it joins Elbow Creek, continuing west to Cross Creek.

Water from this distributary historically flowed into Tulare Lake, as did water continuing down the main channel of the Kaweah. Tulare lake was the terminal sink of an endorheic basin in southern San Joaquin Valley which was also watered by the Kern, Tule, and by some distributaries of the Kings River. Presently water from these rivers is typically used up for irrigation. Water from the St. John&#x27;s irrigates many thousands of acres of farmland in Tulare County.

At a point about north of Farmersville, the St. John&#x27;s enters Elbow Creek. It flows then westerly to Cross Creek at a point north of Goshen and back into Elbow Creek at the confluence of Elbow and Cross creeks. This water in time of flood finds its way into the Tulare Lake Basin through Elbow Creek.

==History==
The St. John&#x27;s River was named after Loomis St. John and was a product of the 1862 flood.

In 1889, the Tulare Irrigation District was organized, and that body constructed a series of canals which diverted water from the river. From one-half to one-third of the water was lost as it coursed through the unlined canals.

In 1906, the St. John&#x27;s River levee broke, and water poured into Visalia from the north, which helped cause the floods of 1906.

<text>East Langdon is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Langdon, in the Dover district of Kent, England. It is northeast from Dover town. In 1961 the parish had a population of 305. On 1 April 1963 the parish was abolished to form &quot;Langdon&quot;.

East Langdon was mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. The word &#x27;Langdon&#x27; is &quot;long hill&quot; in Old English. The first reference to the village, in 861, mentions one Langandune, but a reference in 1291 mentions Estlangedoun and Westlangedone, the latter village of West Langdon being located about to the northwest.

The church is dedicated to Saint Augustine. The remains of Langdon Abbey are nearby.

<text>The KSShch (; tr.:&quot;Korabelny snaryad Shchuka (KSShch)&quot;; ) was a Soviet anti-ship cruise missile design that carried a nuclear warhead. Its GRAU designation is 4K32. It was sometimes referred to as P-1 Strela (П-1 «Стрела», &quot;Arrow&quot;). It was used in the 1950s and 1960s. The missile&#x27;s NATO reporting name was SS-N-1 Scrubber. It was tested in 1953–1954 on the destroyer &quot;Bedovyy&quot; (&quot;Kildin&quot;-class) and entered service in 1955, being deployed on &quot;Kildin&quot;- and &quot;Krupnyy&quot; (later converted to &quot;Kanin&quot;)-class ships. It was fired from a heavy rail launcher SM-59, with an armoured hangar. As those ships were retrofitted and modernized between 1966 and 1977, the missiles were removed (in favor of the SS-N-2 on the Kildin class and an anti-aircraft/anti-submarine weapons suite on the Kanin class).

<text>Sonic Jam is a video game compilation developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Saturn. It was released in Japan in June 1997 and in North America and Europe the following August. It contains the four main &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; games released on the Sega Genesis: &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1991), &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; (1992), &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; (1994) and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; (1994). It also features a 3D environment, &quot;Sonic World&quot;, which doubles as an interactive museum of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; content.

Development began after the Japanese release of &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; in July 1996. &quot;Sonic Jam&quot; was announced at the Spring 1997 Tokyo Game Show as part of a project to increase market awareness of Sega and the &quot;Sonic&quot; brand. It received mostly positive reviews, and was praised for its value, though some criticized the exclusion of &quot;Sonic CD&quot; and &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot;. &quot;Sonic World&quot; was praised for its range of content, though its graphics gathered mixed responses. A version for the handheld Game.com console was released in 1998.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Sonic Jam&quot; is a compilation which contains the four main &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; games released on the Sega Genesis: &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1991), &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; (1992), &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; (1994), and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; (1994). Unlike later &quot;Sonic&quot; collections, &quot;Sonic Jam&quot; does not use a Genesis emulator; the games are true ports, and all are nearly identical to the original Genesis releases, with the exception of minor bug fixes. &quot;Sonic Jam&quot; emulates &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;″ &quot;lock-on technology&quot;—a special feature that allows the player to merge elements of &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; into previous games, with altered levels and the choice to play the combined &quot;Sonic 3 and Knuckles&quot; game and play as Knuckles the Echidna in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;.

The games can be played in three difficulty modes: normal, easy, and original. Original mode is unchanged from the Genesis games, normal mode slightly alters the stage layouts to create a unique (often less difficult) experience, and easy mode adds platforms and removes many obstacles and some levels. New features include the ability to spin dash (introduced in &quot;Sonic 2&quot;) in the first &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog,&quot; play Special Stages separately, a &quot;Time Attack&quot; mode, and a &quot;Time Out&quot; option to disable time limits.

&quot;Sonic Jam&quot; also includes a special 3D environment, &quot;Sonic World&quot;, whereby the player can move around freely as Sonic and interact with various objects. &quot;Sonic World&quot; acts as an interactive museum in which the player can access an array of information of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;-related content, such as viewing concept artwork, manuals, character portfolios, music, and original Japanese advertisements. To access these features, the player must guide Sonic into specific buildings. &quot;Sonic World&quot; also features a &quot;mission list&quot; accessible via jumping on a trampoline. Missions include collecting rings, reaching goalposts, and locating Tails; if all the missions are completed, the player is given the opportunity to view the credits. &quot;Sonic Jam&quot; is compatible with the Saturn&#x27;s 3D Control Pad.

==Development==
At the Tokyo Game Show in early 1997, Sega announced Project Sonic, a promotional campaign aimed at increasing market awareness of the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; brand. Yuji Naka, the co-creator of Sonic, said that &quot;phase one&quot; would introduce &quot;Sonic Jam&quot; as a compilation of games with several improvements rather than being direct ports. At the time of the show, the game was &quot;88% complete&quot;. According to Naka, the purpose of Project Sonic was not only to increase consumer awareness but also renew excitement for Sega, as &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was only initially successful outside of Japan.

Development began after the Japanese release of &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; in July 1996, after Sonic Team received letters from fans asking who Sonic was. The Sonic creators, Naka and Naoto Ohshima, thought it was important to introduce people to Sonic. Sonic Team had not worked on a &quot;Sonic&quot; game since &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; in 1994; other &quot;Sonic&quot; games had been developed by teams including Sega Technical Institute (STI) and Traveller&#x27;s Tales. Naka thought Sonic Team needed a period to &quot;recharge our batteries&quot; and had new ideas.

&quot;Sonic World&quot; was part of an experiment to see how a &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; game would work in full 3D. It served as a prototype for the first fully 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; game, &quot;Sonic Adventure,&quot; which began development for the Saturn but was released on its successor, the Dreamcast, in 1998. &quot;Sonic World&quot; uses the same engine as &quot;Nights.&quot; Naka&#x27;s refusal to share the &quot;Nights&quot; engine with the STI team developing &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot;—a factor in that game&#x27;s cancellation—may have been motivated by his preference for Sonic Team to create an original 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; game. Naka later expressed relief that &quot;X-treme&quot; was cancelled. Naka and Ohshima said the most difficult process was gathering information to include in &quot;Sonic World&quot;, as there were many &quot;Sonic&quot; games they had never heard of.

== Game.com version ==

A version of &quot;Sonic Jam&quot; was released for the Game.com handheld console in 1998, with scaled-down versions of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;, and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;. Unlike it&#x27;s Saturn counterpart, this version did not include &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. &quot;Pocket Gamer&quot; described it as &quot;so far removed from the original releases that the game practically qualifies as an all-new &quot;Sonic&quot; adventure&quot;, criticizing the motion blur, looping music and collision detection.

==Reception==

&quot;Sonic Jam&quot; received mostly positive reviews. It holds an average score of 77% at GameRankings, based on an aggregate of four reviews.

The 3D environment, &quot;Sonic World&quot;, received generally positive reviews. Lee Nutter of &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; said that it featured &quot;some of the most astounding graphics witnessed on the Saturn&quot;, rivaling those of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;. He praised the lack of clipping or glitching, and commended the 3D engine as &quot;truly remarkable&quot;. Glenn Rubenstein from GameSpot, however, was not impressed, feeling it did not look as smooth as &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; or &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot;. Rubenstein praised the unlockable content, in particular the ability to view Japanese versions of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; cartoons and adverts. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; described the 3D world as innovative and fun, but too small to serve as anything more than a preview. The lead reviewer called it &quot;the best Game Select screen ever created&quot; and emphasized that no one should buy the compilation for the 3D world alone.

&quot;GameRevolution&quot; found the 3D graphics of the interactive museum impressive but the setup mundane. They commended the inclusion of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; commercials. Colin Williamson of AllGame said the 3D presentation was &quot;gorgeous&quot;, but felt the overall experience was not as fun compared to &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot;. Special K from &quot;GamePro&quot; felt &quot;Sonic Jam&quot; served as a &quot;great permanent record&quot; of the original &quot;Sonic&quot; games. Steve O&#x27;Learly from &quot;Hyper&quot; praised the detailed graphics of &quot;Sonic World&quot;, saying that it showed the Saturn did perform well if programmed correctly, although he thought that it did not appear as polished as &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;.

Reviewers largely praised the inclusion of the four &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; Genesis/Mega Drive games. Nutter acknowledged that the compilation &quot;may not be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea&quot; and recommended that &quot;Sonic Jam&quot; was not worth purchasing if the player already owned the included games, although he praised its value for money. Rubenstein criticized the lack of &quot;Sonic CD&quot; or &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot;, stating that &quot;Sega could have made a far more complete Sonic collection&quot;. He summarized that &quot;Sonic Jam&quot; was not a definitive &quot;Sonic&quot; experience, asserting that it had only been six years since the original &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was released and &quot;perhaps most of us aren&#x27;t quite nostalgic about it yet&quot;. Game Revolution&#x27;s reviewer echoed that the compilation was merely a &quot;solid set of games that we&#x27;ve seen before&quot;, saying that the game was not recommended if the consumer was &quot;tired of rehashes&quot;, but &quot;well worth thirty or forty bucks.&quot; The &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; team described the games as old and outdated, but still fun. Although Williamson noted that there was a lot of exploring for the player to do in &quot;Sonic Jam&quot;, he expressed skepticism that the majority of the game was from &quot;yesterday&quot; and there were not enough new innovations. O&#x27;Learly praised the faithful and accurate replication of the original games, though he felt they were &quot;dated&quot;. By contrast, Ed Lomas of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; considered it &quot;amazing how well the games have aged&quot;. In a 2014 retrospective, the staff of &quot;GamesRadar&quot; praised &quot;Sonic Jam&quot;&#x27;s &quot;loving&quot; presentation, noting &quot;this was back before classic &quot;Sonic&quot; games appeared on every device known to man&quot;.

<text>During the Great Plague of 1665 the area of Derby, England, fell victim to the bubonic plague epidemic, with many deaths. Some areas of Derby still carry names that record the 1665 visitation such as Blagreaves Lane which was Black Graves Lane, while Dead Man&#x27;s Lane speaks for itself. It has been claimed by some historians that bodies were buried standing upright at St. Peter&#x27;s Church, Derby, but this legend has been refuted by experts.

Trade was carried out at a Market Stone on Ashbourne Road which leads into the Town Centre. During the epidemic, trade almost ceased and the population faced possible starvation, as well as a cruel death by infection with the plague.

Market stones took many forms, here we see the stone placed at Friar Gate (formerly Nuns Green) at the northern road into Derby (England). This was a medieval headless cross, and also called the &quot;Vinegar Stone&quot; because money was deposited in a trough of vinegar in the top of the stone in the belief that the vinegar would disinfect the coins and prevent the spread of the plague from happening.

Eyam Museum in the village of Eyam in the Peak District, Derbyshire, has a special emphasis on the Plague as it struck Eyam.

<text>Nikolay Mikhaylovich Przhevalsky (or Prjevalsky; – ) was a Russian geographer and a renowned explorer of Central and East Asia. Although he never reached his ultimate goal, the city of Lhasa in Tibet, he still travelled through regions then unknown to Westerners, such as northern Tibet (modern Tibet Autonomous Region), Amdo (now Qinghai) and Dzungaria (now northern Xinjiang). He contributed substantially to European knowledge of Central Asian geography.

Przhevalsky described several species previously unknown to European science, such as Przewalski&#x27;s horse, Przewalski&#x27;s gazelle, and the wild Bactrian camel, all of which are now endangered. He was also a mentor of the explorer Pyotr Kozlov.

==Biography==
Przhevalsky was born in the Kimborovo family estate (in the Smolensky Uyezd of the Smolensk Governorate of the Russian Empire) which belonged to his grandfather from his mother&#x27;s side, a Russian nobleman Aleksei Stepanovich Karetnikov, and his wife Ksenia Davydovna Karetnikova who came from local merchants, both natives of the Tula Governorate. Nikolay&#x27;s mother, Elena Alekseevna Karetnikova, married poruchick Mikhail Kuzmitch Przhevalsky whose Cossack ancestors inherited the noble &quot;szlachta&quot; state from Stephen Báthory, and his grandfather converted from Catholicism to Orthodoxy. According to the latest research by Liudmila K. Przhevalskaia, their earliest known ancestor Onisim (Anisim) Pereval (Perevalka, Perevalskii) belonged to the horse-owning middle class of Vitebsk.

Przhevalsky studied in the military academy in St. Petersburg. In 1864, he became a geography teacher at the military school in Warsaw. In 1867, he successfully petitioned the Russian Geographical Society to be dispatched to Irkutsk, in central Siberia. His intention was to explore the basin of the Ussuri River, a major tributary of the Amur on the Russian–Chinese frontier. This was his first important expedition. It lasted two years, after which Przhevalsky published a diary of his expedition under the title, &quot;Travels in the Ussuri Region, 1867–69&quot;.

His most well-known follower and student was Pyotr Kozlov, who discovered the ruins of the Tangut city Khara-Khoto in the Ejin Banner of Alxa League in western Inner Mongolia near the Juyan Lake Basin.

== Further expeditions ==
In the following years he made four journeys to Central Asia:

* 1870–1873 from Kyakhta he crossed the Gobi Desert to Beijing then explored the upper Yangtze, and in 1872 crossed into Tibet. He surveyed over , collected and brought back with him 5000 plants, 1000 birds and 3000 insect species, as well as 70 reptiles and the skins of 130 different mammals. Przehevalsky was awarded the Constantine Medal by the Imperial Geographical Society, promoted to lieutenant-general, appointed to the Tsar&#x27;s General Staff, and received the Order of St. Vladimir, 4th Class.

During his expedition, the Dungan Revolt (1862–77) was raging in China. The journey provided the General Staff with important intelligence on a Muslim uprising in the kingdom of Yaqub Beg in western China, and his lecture to the Russian Imperial Geographical Society was received with &quot;thunderous applause&quot; from an overflow audience. The Russian newspaper &quot;Golos Prikazchika&quot; called the journey &quot;one of the most daring of our time&quot;.
* 1876–1877 travelling through East Turkestan through the Tian Shan, he visited what he believed to be Qinghai Lake, which had reportedly not been visited by any European since Marco Polo. The expedition consisted of ten men, twenty-four camels, four horses, three tonnes of baggage and a budget of 25,000 rubles, but the expedition was beset by disease and poor quality camels. In September 1877, the caravan was refurbished with better camels and horses, 72,000 rounds of ammunition and large quantities of brandy, tea and Turkish delight and set out for Lhasa, but did not reach its goal.
*1879–1880 via Hami and through the Qaidam Basin to Qinghai Lake. The expedition then crossed the Tian Shan into Tibet, proceeding to within of Lhasa before being turned back by Tibetan officials.
*1883–1885 from Kyakhta across the Gobi to Alashan and the eastern Tian Shan mountains, turning back at the Yangze. The expedition then returned to Qinghai Lake and moved westwards to Hotan and Issyk Kul.

The results of these expanded journeys opened a new era for the study of Central Asian geography as well as studies of the fauna and flora of this immense region that were relatively unknown to his Western contemporaries. Among other things, he described Przewalski&#x27;s horse and Przewalski&#x27;s gazelle, which were both named after him. He also described what was then considered to be a wild population of Bactrian camel. In the 21st century, the Wild Bactrian camel was shown to be a separate species from the domestic Bactrian camel. Przhevalsky&#x27;s writings include five major books written in Russian and two English translations: &quot;Mongolia, the Tangut Country, and the Solitudes of Northern Tibet&quot; (1875) and &quot;From Kulja, Across the Tian Shan to Lob-Nor&quot; (1879). The Royal Geographical Society awarded him their Founder&#x27;s Medal in 1879 for his work.

Przhevalsky died of typhus not long before the beginning of his fifth journey, at Karakol on the shore of Issyk Kul in present-day Kyrgyzstan. He contracted typhoid from the Chu River, which was acknowledged as being infected with the disease. The Tsar immediately changed the name of the town to Przhevalsk. There are monuments to him, and a museum about his life and work there and another monument in St. Petersburg.

Less than a year after his premature death, Mikhail Pevtsov succeeded Przhevalsky at the head of his expedition into the remote parts of Central Asia. Przhevalsky&#x27;s work also inspired the career of Pyotr Kozlov.
There is another place named after Przhevalsky: he had lived in a small village called Sloboda, Smolensk Oblast, Russia from 1881 to 1887 (except the period of his travels) and he apparently loved it. The village was renamed after him in 1964 and is now called Przhevalskoye. There is a memorial complex there that includes the old and new houses of Nikolay Przhevalsky, his bust, pond, garden, birch alleys, and &quot;khatka&quot; (a lodge, watch-house). This is the only museum of the famous traveler in Russia.

Przhevalsky is commemorated by Maxim. in the naming of &quot;Przewalskia&quot; , a genus of flowering plants from Asia, belonging to the family Solanaceae.

His name is eponymic with more than 80 plant species as well.

Przhevalsky is honoured in the scientific names of five species of lizards: &quot;Alsophylax przewalskii&quot;, &quot;Eremias przewalskii&quot;, &quot;Phrynocephalus przewalskii&quot;, &quot;Scincella przewalskii&quot;, and &quot;Teratoscincus przewalskii&quot;.

==Accusations of imperialism and prejudice==
According to David Schimmelpenninck Van Der Oye&#x27;s assessment, Przhevalsky&#x27;s books on Central Asia feature his disdain for the &quot;Oriental&quot;— particularly Chinese civilization. Przhevalsky explicitly portrayed Chinese people as cowardly, dirty and lazy in his metaphor, &quot;the blend of a mean Moscow pilferer and a kike&quot;, in all respects inferior to Western culture. He purportedly argued that imperial China&#x27;s hold on its northern territories, in particular Xinjiang and Mongolia, was tenuous and uncertain, and Przhevalsky openly called for Russia&#x27;s annexation of bits and pieces of China&#x27;s territory. Przhevalsky said one should explore Asia &quot;with a carbine in one hand, a whip in the other.&quot;

Przhevalsky, as well as other contemporary explorers including Sven Hedin, Francis Younghusband, and Aurel Stein, were active players in the British–Russian struggle for influence in Central Asia, the so-called Great Game.

Przhevalsky&#x27;s prejudice extended to non-Chinese Asians as well, describing the Tajik Yaqub Beg in a letter as follows, &quot;Yakub Beg is the same shit as all feckless Asiatics. The Kashgarian empire isn&#x27;t worth a kopek.&quot; Przhevalsky also claimed Yaqub was &quot;Nothing more than a political impostor,&quot; and also disdained the Muslim subjects of Yaqub Beg in Kashgar, claiming that they &quot;constantly cursed their government and expressed their desire to become Russian subjects. [...] The savage Asiatic clearly understands Russian power is the guarantee for prosperity.&quot; These statements were made in a report in which Przhevalsky recommended that Russian troops occupy the Kashgarian emirate, but the Russian government took no action, and China recaptured Kashgar. Przhevalsky&#x27;s dreams of taking land from China did not materialize.

Przhevalsky not only disdained Chinese ethnic groups, he also viewed the eight million non-Chinese peoples of Tibet, Turkestan, and Mongolia as uncivilized, evolutionarily backwards people who needed to be freed from Chinese rule.

Przhevalsky proposed Russia provoke rebellions of the Buddhist and Muslim peoples in these areas of China against the Chinese regime, start a war with China, and, with a small number of Russian troops, wrest control of Turkestan from China.

==Personal life==
Przhevalsky is known to have had a personal relationship with Tasya Nuromskaya, whom he met in Smolensk. According to one legend, during their last meeting Nuromskaya cut off her braid and gave it to him, saying that the braid would travel with him until their marriage. She died of a sunstroke while Przhevalsky was on an expedition.

Another woman in Przhevalsky&#x27;s life was a mysterious young lady whose portrait, along with a fragment of poetry, was found in Przhevalsky&#x27;s album. In the poem, she asks him to stay with her and not to go to Tibet, to which he responded in his diary: &quot;I will never betray the ideal, to which is dedicated all of my life. As soon as I write everything necessary, I will return to the desert...where I will be much happier than in the gilded salons that can be acquired by marriage&quot;.

==Myth==
There is an urban legend that Joseph Stalin was an illegitimate son of Nikolay Przhevalsky. The legend is based on the facial similarity of both men, Stalin&#x27;s official birthdate controversy (claims that he was born on 6 December 1878 instead of 21 December 1879), and that the late Stalin era saw a resurrection of interest to the personality of Przhevalsky. Numerous books and monographs were published in the Soviet Union and satellite Communist countries, which was a rare occurrence in regard to the Tsarist-era scientists, and Soviet encyclopedias portrayed Przhevalsky in sharp similarity to Stalin, which was rumored that in such a discrete manner Stalin was paying a homage to his alleged biological father. M. Khachaturova, a Tbilisi resident, who happened to know an unnamed old lady, the original bearer of the secret, was considered to be a whistleblower of the myth about Stalin&#x27;s mother&#x27;s alleged promiscuity. Przhevalsky&#x27;s diary, if it ever existed, was rumored to disappear from archives during the early days of Stalin&#x27;s ascent to power as the Communist party career, especially in its highest echelon, was troublesome for the noble blood people, who claimed a &quot;hoi polloi&quot; origin. There were unsubstantiated claims that certain 1881 paycheck ledger contained brief notes on money transfer from Przhevalsky to Stalin&#x27;s mother; however, Przhevalsky&#x27;s visits to Georgia are not recorded, and G. Egnatashvili, a family friend of the Jughashvilis, did not recollect anything which could possibly substantiate those claims. During the Stalin era, any talk concerning his ancestry and childhood was a public taboo; the ferocity, with which the legend was debunked after the Stalin&#x27;s death with the entire monographs written in order to disprove the myth up until the 2010s, also was considered by some as a further proof of veracity of the Przhevalsky&#x27;s alleged one-night-stand theory. A humorously developed version of this legend appears in &quot;The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin&quot; (Book Three) by Vladimir Voinovich.

<text>The Institute of Technology, Carlow (IT Carlow; ) was an institute of technology, located in Carlow, Ireland. The institute had campuses in Carlow, Wexford, and Wicklow, as well as a part-time provision elsewhere in Ireland. Along with the Waterford Institute of Technology, the institute was dissolved on 1 May 2022 and was succeeded by the South East Technological University.

==Administration==
Dr Patricia Mulcahy was appointed president of the college in 2012, succeeding Dr Ruaidhrí Neavyn who became president of WIT. John Gallagher served as the first Principal of Carlow RTC and subsequently held the post of director of the IT Carlow.

==Recognition==

Institute of Technology Carlow had ranked as the second-largest of Ireland&#x27;s 14 Institutes of Technology with more than 8,448 enrolments and 851 staff, and has generated over 55,000 graduates since its founding in 1970. Institute of Technology Carlow provides higher educational programmes, and research and enterprise development opportunities, through its centres in Carlow, Wexford, and Wicklow; the institute offers more than 80 taught programmes to Level 9 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). Institute of Technology Carlow has the highest percentage of full-time postgraduates in the technological sector, the highest undergraduate progression rate at Level 8 in the higher education sector and the highest percentage of Lifelong Learners in the sector.

The presence of the institute was a consideration in the decision of UNUM (strategic software services centre, 2008) and Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme (human vaccines and biologics, 2007) to locate in Carlow.

In 2014, IT Carlow was named the Sunday Times Institute of Technology of the Year.

==Courses==
IT Carlow provides higher educational full-time courses, along with research and enterprise development opportunities, through its centres in Carlow and Wexford. The institute also provides part-time courses in Carlow, Wexford, Wicklow and Dublin.

<doc id="529286" wikidata="Q2330340" url="?curid=529286" title="List of rivers of Florida">
<text>This is a list of [[stream]]s and [[river]]s in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]]. With one exception, the streams and rivers of Florida all originate on the Coastal plain. That exception is the Apalachicola River, which is formed by the merger of the Chattahoochee River, which originates in the Appalachian Mountains, and the Flint River, which originates in the Piedmont. Most streams and rivers in Florida start from swamps, while some originate from springs or lakes. Many of the streams and rivers are underground for part of their courses. The Everglades, sometimes called the &quot;river of grass&quot;, is a very wide and shallow river that originates from Lake Okeechobee. Most of Florida&#x27;s streams and rivers drain into the Gulf of Mexico. Drainage on the east coast of Florida is dominated by the St. Johns River, which, with the swamps that form its headwaters, extends parallel to the coast from inland of Fort Pierce to Jacksonville.

===Alachua Sink===
Water enters Paynes Prairie Basin from a number of sources. Historically it drained only into Alachua Sink. Water entering the Alachua Sink flows into the Floridan aquifer. (Various sources stating that water entering the Alachua Sink flows to the Santa Fe River may be based on a story told by a Seminole guide to a white explorer in 1823, that a Seminole who had drowned in the sink was later found in the river.) In 1927, Camps Canal was built, which linked the basin to the Orange Lake through the River Styx and ultimately to the Atlantic Ocean.

Lake Okeechobee drains into the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Lucie River, the West Palm Beach Canal, the Hillsboro Canal, the North New River Canal, and the Miami Canal, and into the Gulf of Mexico via the Caloosahatchee Canal which connects to the head of the Caloosahatchee River.
The major input of water into Lake Okeechobee comes from the north, via the Kissimmee River. Rivers are listed as they enter Lake Okeechobee from west to east. Tributaries are listed as they enter their main stem from downstream to upstream.

<text>William Bendix (January 14, 1906 – December 14, 1964) was an American film, radio, and television actor, known for his portrayals of rough, blue-collar characters. He gained significant recognition for his role in &quot;Wake Island&quot;, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Bendix is also remembered for playing Chester A. Riley, the earnest and clumsy aircraft plant worker, in both the radio and television versions of &quot;The Life of Riley.&quot; Additionally, he portrayed baseball legend Babe Ruth in &quot;The Babe Ruth Story&quot;. Bendix frequently co-starred with Alan Ladd, appearing in ten films together; both actors died in 1964.

==Early life==
Bendix was born in Manhattan, the only child of Oscar and Hilda (Carnell) Bendix, and was named William after his German paternal grandfather. His uncle was composer, conductor, and violinist Max Bendix. In the early 1920s, Bendix was a batboy for the New York Yankees and said he saw Babe Ruth hit more than 100 home runs at Yankee Stadium. However, he was fired after fulfilling Ruth&#x27;s request for a large order of hot dogs and soda before a game, which resulted in Ruth being unable to play that day. He worked as a grocer until the Great Depression.

==Career==

===Film===

Bendix began his acting career at age 30 in the New Jersey Federal Theatre Project. He made his film debut in 1942. He played in supporting roles in dozens of Hollywood films, usually as a warm-hearted gangster, detective or serviceman. He began with appearances in films noir, including a supporting role in &quot;The Glass Key&quot; (1942), which featured Brian Donlevy, Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake in the leads. He soon gained attention after appearing in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Lifeboat&quot; (1944) as Gus, a wounded and dying American sailor. He was the top-billed lead in &quot;The Hairy Ape&quot; (1944) based upon the Eugene O&#x27;Neill play, also starring Susan Hayward and Dorothy Comingore.

Bendix&#x27;s other film roles include his portrayal of Babe Ruth in &quot;The Babe Ruth Story&quot; (1948) – a film roundly considered one of the worst sports biopics in film history – and Sir Sagramore opposite Bing Crosby in &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; (1949), in which he took part in the trio, &quot;Busy Doing Nothing&quot;. He played Nick the bartender in the film version of William Saroyan&#x27;s &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot; (1948) starring James Cagney. Bendix had appeared in the stage version, but in the role of Officer Krupp (a role played on film by Broderick Crawford). He was cast in &quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot; (1946), appearing for the second time alongside Ladd and Lake. He also starred in a film adaptation of his radio program &quot;The Life of Riley&quot; (1949).

===Radio and television===
Bendix&#x27;s appearance in the Hal Roach-produced film &quot;The McGuerins from Brooklyn&quot; (1942), playing a rugged blue-collar man, led to his best-remembered role. Producer and creator Irving Brecher saw Bendix as the perfect personification of Chester A. Riley, giving a second chance to a show whose audition failed when the sponsor spurned Groucho Marx for the lead. With Bendix stumbling, bumbling, and skating almost perpetually on thin ice, stretching the patience of his otherwise loving wife and children, &quot;The Life of Riley&quot; was a radio hit from 1944 through 1951, and Bendix brought an adaptation of the film version to &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;.

The show began as a proposed Groucho Marx radio series, &quot;The Flotsam Family&quot;, but the sponsor balked at what would have been essentially a straight head-of-household role for the comedian. Then creator and producer Irving Brecher saw Bendix as taxicab company owner Tim McGuerin in &quot;The McGuerins from Brooklyn&quot;. Brecher stated, &quot;He was a Brooklyn guy and there was something about him. I thought, This guy could play it. He&#x27;d made a few films, like &quot;Lifeboat&quot;, but he was not a name. So I took &quot;The Flotsam Family&quot; script, revised it, made it a Brooklyn Family, took out the flippancies and made it more meat-and-potatoes, and thought of a new title, &quot;The Life of Riley&quot;. Bendix&#x27;s delivery and the spin he put on his lines made it work.&quot; The reworked script cast Bendix as blundering Chester A. Riley, a wing riveter at the fictional Cunningham Aircraft plant in California. His frequent exclamation of indignation&quot;What a revoltin&#x27; development this is!&quot;became one of the catchphrases of the 1940s. It was later reused by Benjamin J. Grimm of the Fantastic Four.
Bendix was not able to play the role on television because of a contracted film commitment. The part instead went to Jackie Gleason and aired a single season beginning in October 1949. Despite winning an Emmy award, the show was canceled, in part because Gleason was less acceptable as Riley, since Bendix had been so identified with the part on radio. In 1953, Bendix became available for a new television version, and this time the show was a hit. The second television version of &quot;The Life of Riley&quot; ran from 1953 to 1958, long enough for Riley to become a grandfather.

On the 1952 television program &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, hosted by Ralph Edwards, Bendix was claimed to be a descendant of the 19th-century composer Felix Mendelssohn.

Bendix played the lead in Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;The Time Element&quot; (1958), a time-travel adventure episode about a man who travels back to 1941 and unsuccessfully tries to warn everyone in Honolulu about the impending attack on Pearl Harbor; the program&#x27;s success opened the doors for Serling&#x27;s later series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. Bendix also appeared on &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot; (also 1958). He returned for a second appearance on October 1, 1959, the fourth-season premiere of the series, in which he and Tennessee Ernie Ford performed a comedy skit about a safari.

In NBC&#x27;s &quot;Wagon Train&quot; (&quot;Around the Horn&quot;, 1958), Bendix played the captain of a sailing cargo ship who shanghaied Major Adams (Ward Bond), Bill Hawks (Terry Wilson) and Charlie Wooster (Frank McGrath), forcing them to work on his ship. On November 16, 1959, Bendix appeared on NBC&#x27;s color broadcast of &quot;The Steve Allen Plymouth Show&quot; with Jack Kerouac. A color videotape of the broadcast survives. Bendix starred in all 17 episodes of the NBC Western series &quot;Overland Trail&quot; (1960) in the role of Frederick Thomas &quot;Fred&quot; Kelly. He guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Mister Ed&quot; (&quot;Pine Lake Lodge&quot;, 1961) which served as a backdoor pilot for a proposed sitcom that was not picked up.

In the fall of 1964, an American situation comedy starring Bendix and Martha Raye was scheduled to air on CBS, but due to Bendix&#x27;s shaky health, the network decided not to air the program. This action resulted in a lawsuit from Bendix for $2.658 million in May, with the actor stating that the decision hurt his career and that he was in excellent health and could perform all of the requirements of the agreement. The case was settled out of court. Bendix died on December 14, 1964, of complications from pneumonia.

==Personal life==
Bendix married a childhood friend, Theresa Stefanotti, on October 22, 1927. They remained married until his death 37 years later in 1964. The couple had a daughter, Lorraine, and adopted another, Stephanie.

Bendix died in Los Angeles at age 58 in 1964 as the result of a chronic stomach ailment that brought on malnutrition and ultimately lobar pneumonia. He was interred at the San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills, Los Angeles.

Bendix was a Republican. During the 1944 presidential election campaign, he attended a large rally organized by David O. Selznick in the Los Angeles Coliseum in support of the Dewey-Bricker ticket as well as Governor Earl Warren of California.

<doc id="529321" wikidata="Q96837" url="?curid=529321" title="Helmut Koester">
<text>Helmut Heinrich Koester (December 18, 1926 – January 1, 2016) was an American scholar who specialized in the New Testament and early Christianity at Harvard Divinity School. His research was primarily in the areas of New Testament interpretation, history of early Christianity, and archaeology of the early Christian period.

==Life==
Koester was born in Hamburg, Germany. He served in the Wehrmacht Navy from 1943–1945 and was released from a POW camp in 1945 and studied under Rudolf Bultmann at the University of Marburg. He submitted his dissertation in 1954 and then became an assistant to Günther Bornkamm at the University of Heidelberg from 1954-1956. Koester began teaching at Harvard Divinity School in 1958 and became John H. Morison Research Professor of Divinity and Winn Research Professor of Ecclesiastical History in 2000. Koester was co-editor and chair of the New Testament editorial board of the commentary series &quot;Hermeneia: A Critical and Historical Commentary on the Bible&quot; published by Fortress Press (Minneapolis). He served as the president of the Society of Biblical Literature (1991), was member of the Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas (SNTS) and was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Koester was an ordained minister of the Lutheran Church. In 1953, he married Gisela Harrassowitz, with whom he had four children, named Reinhild, Almut, Ulrich, and Heiko. He had three grandchildren including Christopher, Lukas, and Alexander. He died on January 1, 2016, at the age of 89.

==Work==
In his dissertation (published as &quot;Synoptische Überlieferung bei den Apostolischen Vätern&quot;, i.e. &quot;Synoptic Tradition in the Apostolic Fathers&quot;), Koester was able to demonstrate that much material in the so-called Apostolic Fathers that parallels elements in the Synoptic Gospels need not necessarily reflect dependence upon the written form of the Synoptics known to us. This was an extremely significant observation, and one with which all subsequent scholarship on early Christian gospel traditions would have to reckon. Among his numerous subsequent publications, his two-volume &quot;Introduction to the New Testament&quot; has become a standard reference work. Koester views the narratives of Jesus&#x27; virgin birth as having roots in Hellenistic mythology.

<text>Puffing Billy is the world&#x27;s oldest surviving steam locomotive, constructed in 1813–1814 by colliery viewer William Hedley, enginewright Jonathan Forster and blacksmith Timothy Hackworth for Christopher Blackett, the owner of Wylam Colliery near Newcastle upon Tyne, in the United Kingdom. It was employed to haul coal chaldron wagons from the mine at Wylam to the docks at Lemington in Northumberland.

== History ==
=== Precursors ===
The first steam-powered locomotive on rails was built by Richard Trevithick in either 1802 or 1804. He built several locomotives, and although the success of his 1802 locomotive at Coalbrookdale is questioned, his 1804 locomotive ran near the Pen-y-Darren Ironworks in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales successfully enough to haul five wagons of iron for nine miles, winning a wager. Its excessive weight cracked the iron rails, rendering it impractical, and steam locomotives were not adopted at the time.
In 1810, the Durham Coalfield was disrupted by a major strike over the Bond system. During this time Christopher Blackett, owner of the Wylam Colliery, took advantage of the pit&#x27;s idleness to experiment with the idea of a locomotive-hauled tramway worked purely by adhesion, rather than the Blenkinsop rack system that would be used on the Middleton. These began with a simple hand-cranked wagon, converted from a coal wagon chassis with the addition of a central drive shaft and geared drives to the axles.

As this experiment was successful, by 1812 it was followed by Wylam&#x27;s first prototype &#x27;travelling engine&#x27;, worked by steam. This was based on a combination of the test wagon, with a single cylinder engine and boiler atop it. Little is known of the design, although it has been said to have been inspired by Trevithick&#x27;s Pen-y-darren locomotive. It is unclear whether the single cylinder was vertical or horizontal, and whether the boiler had a single straight flue or a return flue. It may have been nicknamed &quot;Grasshopper&quot;. The &#x27;travelling engine&#x27; was successful as a prototype, but underpowered and prone to stalling when overloaded or faced by a gradient. It was however convincing enough as a demonstration to encourage Blackett to fund further locomotives.

=== Prototypes ===
&quot;Puffing Billy&quot; was one of three similar engines built by Hedley, the resident engineer at Wylam Colliery, to replace the horses used as motive power on the tramway. In 1813, Hedley built for Blackett&#x27;s colliery business on the Wylam Colliery line the prototypes, &quot;Puffing Billy&quot; and &quot;Wylam Dilly&quot;. They were both rebuilt in 1815 with ten wheels, but were returned to their original condition in 1830 when the railway was relaid with stronger rails.

In the September 1814 edition of &quot;Annals of Philosophy&quot; two locomotives with rack wheels are mentioned (probably &quot;Salamanca&quot; and &quot;Blücher&quot;), then there is mention of &quot;another steam locomotive at Newcastle, employed for a similar purpose [hauling coals], and moving along without any rack wheel, simply by its friction against the rail road&quot;. From the context, this is at a different location to &quot;Blücher&quot;, so is probably &quot;Puffing Billy&quot;.

&quot;Puffing Billy&quot; remained in service until 1862, when Edward Blackett, the owner of Wylam Colliery, lent it to the Patent Office Museum in South Kensington, London (later the Science Museum). He later sold it to the museum for £200. It is still on display there. Its sister locomotive, &quot;Wylam Dilly&quot;, is preserved in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.

Two replicas exist: one, built in a Royal Bavarian State Railways workshop in 1906, is at the German Museum, Munich; the other, at Beamish Museum, was first run in 2006.

== Design ==
&quot;Puffing Billy&quot; incorporated a number of novel features, patented by Hedley, which were to prove important to the development of locomotives. It had two vertical cylinders, one on either side of the boiler, and partly enclosed by it, and drove a single crankshaft beneath the frames, from which gears drove and also coupled the wheels allowing better traction.


The engine had a number of serious technical limitations. Running on cast-iron wagonway plates, its eight-ton weight was too heavy and broke them, encouraging opponents of locomotive traction to criticise the innovation. This problem was alleviated by redesigning the engine with four axles so that the weight was spread more evenly. The engine was eventually rebuilt as a four-wheeler when improved edge rails track was introduced around 1830. It was not particularly fast, being capable of no more than 5 mph (8 km/h).

== Legacy ==
&quot;Puffing Billy&quot; was an important influence on George Stephenson, who lived locally, and its success was a key factor in promoting the use of steam locomotives by other collieries in north-eastern England.

It has been suggested that &quot;Puffing Billy&quot;&#x27;s name survives in the English language in the intensifier &quot;like billy-o&quot;, but there are several alternative explanations for that phrase&#x27;s origin.

<text>The Puffing Billy Railway is a narrow gauge heritage railway in the southern foothills of the Dandenong Ranges in Melbourne, Australia. The railway was one of the five narrow gauge lines of the Victorian Railways which opened around the beginning of the 20th century. It is close to the city of Melbourne and is one of the most popular steam heritage railways in the world, attracting tourists from Australia and overseas. The railway aims to preserve and restore the line and its operation as closely as possible to the way it was in the first three decades of its existence, but with particular emphasis on the early 1920s.

The starting point of the railway is Belgrave station which houses the railway&#x27;s operations and administration centre. The line runs through Lakeside Station where a visitor information centre provides catering and an indoor interpretive space, and terminates at Gembrook railway station.

In 2022, passengers were allowed to resume the popular practice of sitting on the window ledges of carriages with their legs dangling outside, which had become a core part of the charm of the railway.

==History==
The original line was opened in 1900 to serve the local farming and timber community. It ran to Gembrook from Upper Ferntree Gully station, which was the terminus of the broad gauge line from Melbourne. The section of the line from Upper Ferntree Gully to Belgrave was rebuilt to gauge between 1958 and 1962 and is now operated by Metro Trains Melbourne suburban electric trains. 

The railway had attracted a number of colloquial names locally before &quot;Puffing Billy&quot; became the dominant one. Services stopped in 1953 after a landslide blocked the line between Selby and Menzies Creek, and it was formally closed in 1954. At the end of 1954, the Victorian Railways sought to minimise their financial risks if the railway was to reopen. Harold L. Hewett, a teacher at Melbourne Grammar School, organised a rally attended by 400 people at Upper Ferntree Gully station on 4 January 1955 to try to save the railway.

=== Preservation ===
Following closure, a few farewell specials operated on the remaining usable section to Belgrave, and these proved very popular. On 1 October 1955, the Puffing Billy Preservation Society was formed to keep the railway running indefinitely. They operated trains to Belgrave until 1958 when services again ceased for conversion to a broad-gauge, electrified suburban line. The society started work on restoring the Belgrave to Lakeside section. Rover Scouts attending the 7th World Rover Moot held at Wonga Park assisted in the clearing of the line between Belgrave and Menzies Creek as part of the event&#x27;s community service component. On 28 July 1962 trains resumed running between Belgrave and Menzies Creek.

Operations were extended over the remainder of the original line, opening to Emerald on 31 July 1965 and Lakeside on 18 October 1975 before reaching Gembrook, which was opened on 18 October 1998. The first trains to Gembrook carried children from the primary schools along the Belgrave–Gembrook corridor, two of which directly adjoin the railway and the remainder not more than a street away. 

The railway operates daily (except for Christmas day) between Belgrave and Lakeside, with services to Gembrook on Sundays. Its infrastructure is restored and recreated to reflect the heyday of the line between 1900 and 1930, and is operated with some of the railway practices from the Victorian Railways of that era, such as using the &quot;Staff and Ticket&quot; safeworking system. In the 2016/17 financial year, Puffing Billy carried 487,237 passengers, up more than 60,000 from the previous financial year.

==Structure==

When the Puffing Billy Preservation Society was formed in 1955, the line was still under the control and ownership of the Victorian Railways (V.R.). The society arranged for the V.R. to run the train on weekends and holidays, with the Society guaranteeing the V.R. against losses from insufficient ticket sales. Society volunteers took the role of conductors, checking tickets on the train, and fund-raising. That arrangement continued until the Upper Ferntree Gully to Belgrave section of the line was closed in 1958.

When the line reopened in 1962, between Belgrave and Menzies Creek, society volunteers took a larger role, staffing stations, selling and checking tickets, doing non-safety-critical maintenance on the train, and track maintenance under the supervision of a V.R. ganger. Ticket revenue went into an account on which the V.R. drew to pay its staff involved in running the line.

The V. R. was not in the preservation or tourism business, and the arrangement was less than ideal, so the Victorian Government passed the Emerald Tourist Railway Act 1977 (No. 9020), which set up the Emerald Tourist Railway Board (ETRB) as a statutory authority to take over ownership and operation of the railway from the V. R. after 1 October 1977. The act required that the Board have between five and ten members, four of whom were to be nominated by the Puffing Billy Preservation Society. The ETRB was defined as the operator of the Railway, with the Puffing Billy Preservation Society providing the volunteer support. 

All volunteers on the railway were directly engaged by the ETRB and were required to register and complete a range of induction processes. The railway still relied heavily on the volunteers, who welcome guests from all parts of the world and are highly trained to supply the safe and successful operation of the railway.

There are many roles required to operate a heritage steam railway in compliance with modern obligastions. They include signalmen, guards, firemen, engine cleaners, drivers, track patrollers, fire patrollers, safeworkers, station-masters, conductors, booking clerks, refreshment staff, gardeners, maintenance workers, researchers, and administration. Staff also operate across management, finance, human relations (HR), Occupational Health and Safety (OH&amp;S), child safety, workshops, way and works, and operational staff who support the volunteer roles. 

In 2022, the Emerald Tourist Railway Act 1977 was replaced by the Puffing Billy Railway Act 2022. That move was partly influenced by the recommendations in the 2018 report by the Victorian Ombudsman on the activities of child sex offender Robert Whitehead at the Puffing Billy Railway and other Victorian heritage railway organisations. The new act replaced the ETRB with the Puffing Billy Railway Board, the role of which was &quot;to operate, manage and maintain the infrastructure and assets of the Puffing Billy Railway&quot;. The running of trains services remained largely in the hands of volunteers organised by the Puffing Billy Preservation Society, and they continue to be at the core of the day-to-day operation of the railway.

==Operation==
The main offices of the railway are at Belgrave, along with the locomotive running shed and locomotive workshops, and track maintenance operations. Other offices are located at Emerald). Trains from Belgrave generally travel to Lakeside, with some services extended to Gembrook. The railway operates every day of the year except Christmas Day.

The train has a maximum operating speed of 24 km/h (15 mph), with its average speed being 16 km/h (10 mph).

A popular feature of a ride on Puffing Billy was sitting on the ledge of the open-sided carriages. After a crash between a train and a minibus at the Menzies Creek level crossing on 5 March 2018, this practice was suspended. The suspension was permanently lifted on 4 February 2022.

There is a narrow-gauge railway museum at Menzies Creek station, which reopened in March 2022 after re-development. It is open on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

==Scandal==
In 2014, Robert Whitehead, a long-serving volunteer on the railway, was convicted of multiple sexual offences against young boys. He died in prison in 2015 while serving a sentence of more than 8 years. Whitehead had been convicted and jailed in 1959 for molesting a boy scout, but he returned to his job on the railways at the request of Murray Porter, a state government minister. He joined the Puffing Billy Railway as a volunteer in 1961 and rose to become Secretary of the Puffing Billy Preservation Society. He used his position to meet and molest boys into the 1990s. In 2018, the ombudsman&#x27;s report on the case found that the board of the railway had known about Whitehead&#x27;s activities and had actively protected him. Significant changes have occurred at the railway since the Ombudsman Report that includes implementing the recommendations and supporting an open and transparent complaints and feedback process. In 2022, a new Victorian Parliament Act was passed that replaced the Emerald Tourist Railway Board with the Puffing Billy Railway Board. The Act modernised the governance of the railway which was noted by the Ombudsman to have failed.

==Locomotives and rolling stock==

===Locomotives===
The railway owns all the surviving Victorian Railways narrow-gauge locomotives and has restored all but one to operating condition, although not all are running at any one time. This includes NA class locomotives 3A (unrestored), 6A, 7A, 8A, 12A and 14A, and G class Garratt locomotive G42.

In December 2019 NG G16 Garratt locomotive 129 imported from South Africa entered service. It had been purchased in 1996, and was rebuilt and re-gauged for the Puffing Billy. It complements the operational capabilities of G42. The NA class locomotives are limited to pulling a maximum of 12 carriages, while the Garratts can haul up to 18. 

The railway has a number of smaller steam locomotives at museum at Menzies Creek, either on static display or in operating condition. These include a Peckett , 2 Decauvilles (one is a , and the other a ) both from the West Melbourne Gasworks, and a Climax geared locomotive from the Tyers Valley Tramway. They occasionally operate special trains and at events such as Thomas the Tank Engine days.

Puffing Billy Railway also offers driver experience days on the smaller steam engines. The Climax engine has been restored for this purpose as it has a large driving cab and is unique in Australia.

The railway operates three diesel locomotives which are used on days of total fire ban, plant or works trains, or when too few steam locomotives are available, including in emergencies. D21 is former Tasmanian Government Railways V class V12, while DH5 and DH59 are ex Queensland Railways DH class. All were regauged and rebuilt for the railway. Diesel Rail Tractor (RT 1) is mainly used for shunting rolling stock at the carriage workshops.

====VR Original====
====Other steam====
===Carriages===
The mainstay of the carriage fleet are the 15 NBH open-sided carriages built specially for tourist traffic on the Gembrook line by the V.R. between 1918 and 1919, and a further 10 vehicles built to the same or similar design in the preservation era. However, there are also a number of enclosed carriages, both saloon and compartment cars. In addition, four carriages were obtained from the Mount Lyell Railway in Tasmania after its closure in 1963, and regauged and reclassified for Puffing Billy use, numbered 1 to 4 NBL. They are named &quot;Mt Lyell, Rinadeena, Teepookana&quot;, and &quot;Dubbil Barril&quot; respectively, reflecting their Tasmanian heritage. During the 1980s and 1990s they were all upgraded to first class carriages, recoded 1 to 4 NAL, and are now primarily used on the Luncheon train and Dinner trains.

Several carriages have been temporarily converted to include a guard&#x27;s compartment. A number of NQR low-sided goods trucks have also been modified for passenger use, making them similar to the NBH carriages. Another three NQR trucks have been fitted with seats but no roof and are only used during the summer peak season.
===Goods vehicles and brake vans===
Representatives of all classes of goods vehicles and brake vans (including combined brake van and passenger carriage) used on the narrow gauge lines of the Victorian Railways are to be found on the Puffing Billy line, and are used for works trains, storage, and occasional heritage trains recreating the look of trains in the 1920s.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Solo One&quot; was a TV police drama series produced by Crawford Productions that screened in 1976, filmed and set in Emerald, Victoria, about a local (fictional) policeman dealing with crime in the town, however it was aimed at a younger audience than most Australian TV police dramas. It featured Puffing Billy in the opening credits scene as well as being part of most story-lines.

The ABC children&#x27;s drama &quot;Come Midnight Monday&quot; was filmed in and around Belgrave, Emerald &amp; Cockatoo and featuring Puffing Billy locomotive 12A—renamed &quot;Wombat&quot;—as the main character.

Filming of &quot;A Country Practice&quot; in the fictional town of Wandin Valley (the towns of Wandin, Wandin North and Wandin East are however 30 km north of Emerald) was moved to Emerald when the show moved to Network 10, and occasionally featured Puffing Billy.

The 1966 television special &quot;The Seekers at Home&quot; filmed a segment at Puffing Billy, where The Seekers sing &quot;Morningtown Ride&quot; to a group of children.

Filming of &quot;Round the Twist&quot; was in and around Belgrave to Lakeside.

In 1997, the soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; filmed scenes set on and around the train. The characters of Darren Stark and Libby Kennedy lost young Louise Carpenter and chased after the train en route to Belgrave on a motorbike to catch up with her after discovering she had boarded it.

==Line guide==

Regular Puffing Billy services usually only stop at stations shown in bold print at the right. Stops at other stations can be made by request. Distances are from Southern Cross station.

<text>Marka is the name of the forested and hilly areas surrounding Oslo, Norway. It includes areas within the municipality of Oslo, but also large areas in Hole, Ringerike in Buskerud county and Jevnaker, Lunner, Nittedal, Bærum, Asker, and other municipalities in Akershus county. The name is actually just the finite form of &quot;mark&quot; (Norse &quot;mǫrk&quot; f) &#x27;woodland, forest&#x27;. (See also Finnmark, Hedmark, Telemark, Marker and Aremark.)

Though not designated a borough of Oslo, it is a major recreational area for the population of Oslo, and development in the area is for the most part prohibited. Despite being used frequently by many inhabitants of Oslo, especially at weekends, the fauna of &quot;marka&quot; includes species such as lynx, wolf, beaver, moose and roe deer.

Oslomarka is the collective term usually used for all the recreational areas, comprising the contiguous areas of forest and open fields, around Oslo. Marka is the administrative name for the part of it that lies inside the city limits. Neighboring municipalities (most of which lie in Viken) do not have the same kind of administrative division as Oslo, and thus do not have any separate administrative arrangement for their parts of the area. The area within Oslo municipality is divided into two parts. The population and agricultural areas of Marka are located mainly in two valleys, Sørkedalen and Maridalen.

Oslomarka is further divided into:
*Kjekstadmarka
*Vestmarka
*Krokskogen
* Bærumsmarka
*Nordmarka
*Romeriksåsen
*Lillomarka
*Gjelleråsen
*Østmarka
*Sørmarka
Of these, Vestmarka, Kjekstadmarka, Romeriksåsene, Follomarka and Sørmarka lie almost entirely outside the city limits.

<doc id="529346" wikidata="Q10720238" url="?curid=529346" title="Wilton Abbey">
<text>Wilton Abbey was a Benedictine convent in Wiltshire, England, three miles west of Salisbury, probably on the site now occupied by Wilton House. It was active from the early tenth century until 1539.

==History==
===Foundation===
Wilton Abbey is first recorded in the 930s, but a 15th-century poem dates its foundation to the late 8th century by Weohstan, ealdorman of Wiltshire, and his widow Alburga is said to have been its abbess. This claim has been accepted by some historians, but it is rejected by the ecclesiastical historian, Sarah Foot, who describes it as a new foundation in the tenth century. The story is also dismissed by the historian Elizabeth Crittall. Alburga (or Æthelburh) is said to have been the half-sister of King Ecgberht of Wessex, but she is not mentioned in biographies of Ecgberht.

===Anglo Saxon era===
The community was to number 26 nuns. It was attached to St Mary&#x27;s Church. Two daughters of king Edward the Elder and Ælfflæd, Eadflæd and Æthelhild, probably joined the community, Eadflæd as a nun and Æthelhild as a lay sister. They were buried at Wilton with their mother. Their half-brother, king Æthelstan, made two grants of land to a congregation at Wilton in the 930s, including one in 937 for the remission of his sins and those of Eadflæd.

In 955 King Eadwig granted the nuns of Wilton Abbey an estate called &quot;Chelke&quot; (&quot;Chalke&quot;, Saxon &quot;æt Ceolcum&quot;) which included land in Broad Chalke and Bowerchalke.

===Wulfthryth era===
Wulfthryth of Wilton, the wife (or concubine) of Edgar, King of the English (reigned 959–975), was abbess of Wilton between the early 960s and about 1000. According to Stenton, she was a nun when Edgar (who could not have been more than sixteen at the time, and she a bit older) abducted her from the abbey and carried her off to his palace at Kemsing, near Sevenoaks. Abduction of a bride was not uncommon in pre-Christian and early Christian Anglo-Saxon society, and it is unknown how much of her abduction was with her consent. Nevertheless, she was held at Kemsing for two years, during which time she bore Edgar a daughter Saint Edith, whom he acknowledged and supported for the rest of his life. St. Dunstan, an advisor to Edgar, later talked the king into doing penance for the abduction: reportedly, Edgar refrained from wearing his crown for seven years.

By the early 960&#x27;s, Wulfthryth was installed as abbess back at Wilton (where she raised her daughter), and Edgar had bestowed the abbey with treasure and land. In 964 Edgar married Ælfthryth, in a Christian ceremony which would have nullified any pagan arrangement with Wulfthryth; because of this, modern historians sometimes refer to her as a &quot;concubine&quot; but the word is inaccurate, given the custom of the time. Having been given wealth by the king, and being of a noble background herself, Wulfthryth used her wealth to build up Wilton&#x27;s relic collection. She was also able to use her royal connections to protect Wilton in other ways, such as securing the release of two Wilton priests who had been imprisoned by the reeve of Wilton.

Her daughter died between 984 and 987 at the age of 23, and her mother and various royalty, as well as enormous local popular support, promoted her cult as a saint.

===High middle ages===
In 1003 Sweyn, King of Denmark, destroyed the town of Wilton but it is unknown whether the abbey shared its fate. Edith of Wessex, the wife of Edward the Confessor, who had been educated at Wilton, rebuilt the abbey in stone; it had formerly been of wood.

In the year before the Norman conquest, a couple gave their daughter Eve of Wilton to the abbey. She left in 1080 to have a notable life in France.

The Abbess of Wilton held an entire barony from the king, a privilege shared by only three other English nunneries, Shaftesbury, Barking, and St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, Winchester. As the head of a barony, the abbess had the obligation to provide the royal army with knights when summoned. The abbess had the privilege to appoint offices in her realm, which made her an important patron; her most prestigious cause of patronage was her right to appoint deacon to the conventual church, which had a great deal of clergymen in office at any given time.

Wilton Abbey was favoured by the royal family and given many rich donations from members of the royal family, such as from Henry I and Queen Maud. The king, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of Salisbury, and sometimes the queen, had the right to nominate nuns to Wilton, and the king exercised this right on his coronation and on the creation of a new abbess, and the queen on her coronation.

In 1143 King Stephen made it his headquarters, but was put to flight by Matilda&#x27;s forces under Robert, Earl of Gloucester.

During the 13th-century, Wilton Abbey experienced a period of financial crisis, and between 1246 and 1276, several gifts were made from the crown and the church for the repair of the buildings, which were at this point described as having fallen into a serious state of disrepair.

Several scandals are known to have occurred in Wilton Abbey. In 1284 and 1302 nuns of Wilton were found guilty of misconduct, and again in 1379.

In 1528, the crown interfered in the election of a new abbess after the death of Cecily Willoughby. The abbey nominated the election of the prioress, Isabel Jordayne, described as &#x27;ancient, wise and discreet&#x27;, while Anne Boleyn favoured her brother-in-law William Carey&#x27;s sister Eleanor Carey. Henry VIII preferred Isabel Jordayne when Eleanor Carey&#x27;s candidacy was destroyed by serious moral charges against her. In 1535, the abbess complained about Thomas Leigh&#x27;s too strictly enforced enclosure, as it would not be possible for her to conduct the abbey&#x27;s business properly if she was not allowed to leave the convent on business, as the abbey was in debt.

===Dissolution===
Cecily Bodenham, the last abbess, surrendered the convent to the commissioners of King Henry VIII on 25 March 1539 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The site was granted to Sir William Herbert, afterwards Earl of Pembroke, who commenced the building of Wilton House, still the abode of his descendants. There are no remains of the ancient buildings.

<doc id="529355" wikidata="Q189427" url="?curid=529355" title="A Chorus Line">
<text>A Chorus Line is a 1975 musical conceived by Michael Bennett with music by Marvin Hamlisch, lyrics by Edward Kleban, and a book by James Kirkwood Jr. and Nicholas Dante.

Set on the bare stage of a Broadway theater, the musical is centered on seventeen Broadway dancers auditioning for spots on a chorus line. &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; provides a glimpse into the personalities of the performers and the choreographer, as they describe the events that have shaped their lives and their decisions to become dancers.

Following several workshops and an Off-Broadway production, &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; opened at the Shubert Theatre on Broadway July 25, 1975, directed by Michael Bennett and co-choreographed by Bennett and Bob Avian. An unprecedented box office and critical hit, the musical received twelve Tony Award nominations and won nine, in addition to the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

The original Broadway production ran for 6,137 performances, becoming the longest-running production in Broadway history until surpassed by &quot;Cats&quot; in 1997, and the longest-running Broadway musical originally produced in the US, until surpassed in 2011 by the revival of &quot;Chicago&quot;. It remains the seventh longest-running Broadway show ever. &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;″s success has spawned many successful productions worldwide. It began a lengthy run in the West End in 1976 winning the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical and was revived on Broadway in 2006, and in the West End in 2013.

==Synopsis==
The show opens during an audition for an upcoming Broadway production. The formidable director Zach and his assistant choreographer Larry put the 24 dancers through their paces. Every dancer is desperate for work (&quot;I Hope I Get It&quot;). After a round of cuts, 17 dancers remain. Zach tells them he is looking for a strong 8-member dancing chorus of four boys and four girls. Wanting to learn more about them, he asks the dancers to introduce themselves. Reluctantly, the dancers reveal their pasts. The stories generally progress chronologically from early life experiences through adulthood to the end of a career.

The first candidate, Mike Costa, explains that he is the youngest of 12 children. He recalls his first experience with dance, watching his sister Rosalie&#x27;s dance class when he was a preschooler (&quot;I Can Do That&quot;). Mike replaced her one day when she refused to go to class—and he stayed. Bobby Mills tries to hide his unhappy childhood by making jokes. As he speaks, the other dancers distrust this strange audition process and debate what they should reveal to Zach (&quot;And...&quot;), but since they all need the job, the session continues.

Zach is angered that the streetwise Sheila Bryant is seemingly not taking the audition seriously. Opening up, she reveals that her mother married at a young age and her father neither cared about nor loved them. At age six she realized, as had fellow auditionees Bebe Benzenheimer and Maggie Winslow, that ballet helped her escape her unhappy family life (&quot;At the Ballet&quot;). Scatterbrained and tone-deaf Kristine Urich-DeLuca laments being unable to sing, while her husband Al finishes her phrases in tune (&quot;Sing!&quot;).

Mark Anthony, the youngest dancer, relates his first exposure to the male and female anatomy and his first wet dream, and the Connie Wong laments the problems of being short, while the other dancers share their own memories of adolescence (&quot;Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love&quot;). Diana Morales recollects her horrible high school acting class (&quot;Nothing&quot;). Don Kerr remembers his first job at a nightclub and Judy Turner reflects on her problematic childhood while some auditioners talk about their parents&#x27; opinions (&quot;Mother&quot;). Greg Gardner discusses discovering his homosexuality and Richie Walters recounts nearly becoming a kindergarten teacher (&quot;Gimme the Ball&quot;). Finally, the newly- Val Clark explains that talent alone isn&#x27;t everything without good looks, and plastic surgery can really help improve one&#x27;s image and career prospects (&quot;Dance: Ten, Looks: Three&quot;).

The dancers go downstairs to learn a song for the audition&#x27;s next section, but experienced dancer Cassie Ferguson, who has had notable successes as a soloist, stays onstage to talk to Zach. They have a history together: Zach had previously cast her in featured parts, and they had lived together for several years. Zach tells Cassie that she is too good for the chorus and shouldn&#x27;t be at this audition. However, she explains her current inability to find solo work and is willing to &quot;come home&quot; to the chorus where she can at least express her passion for dance (&quot;The Music and the Mirror&quot;). Zach relents and sends her downstairs to learn the dance combination.

Zach calls Paul San Marco, who has been reluctant to share his past, onstage for a private talk, and he emotionally relives his childhood and teenage years, his early career in a drag act, facing his manhood and his homosexuality, and his parents ultimately discovering his lifestyle and disowning him for it, before breaking down, with Zach comforting him. Cassie and Zach&#x27;s complex relationship resurfaces during a run-through of the number created to showcase an unnamed star (&quot;One&quot;). Zach confronts Cassie, feeling that she is &quot;dancing down,&quot; and they rehash the issues in their relationship and her career. Zach points to the machine-like movement of the other dancers, who have all blended together and will probably never be recognized individually, and mockingly asks if she wants this. Cassie defiantly defends the dancers: &quot;I’d be proud to be one of them. They’re wonderful...They’re all special. I’d be happy to be dancing in that line. Yes, I would...and I&#x27;ll take chorus...if you&#x27;ll take me.&quot;

During a tap sequence, Paul falls and injures his knee that recently underwent surgery. After Paul is carried off to the hospital, all at the audition stand in disbelief, realizing that their careers can also end in an instant. Zach asks the remaining dancers what they will do when they can no longer dance. Diana leads the company in &quot;What I Did for Love&quot;, where she expresses a lack of regret for pursuing her dreams. The final eight dancers are selected: Mike, Cassie, Bobby, Judy, Richie, Val, Mark, and Diana.

&quot;One&quot; (Reprise/Finale) begins with an individual bow for each of the 19 characters, their hodgepodge rehearsal clothes replaced by identical spangled gold costumes. As each dancer joins the group, it is suddenly difficult to distinguish one from the other: ironically, each character who was an individual to the audience seems now to be an anonymous member of a never-ending ensemble.

==Production history==
The musical was formed from several taped workshop sessions with Broadway dancers, known as &quot;gypsies,&quot; including eight who eventually appeared in the original cast. The sessions were originally hosted by dancers Michon Peacock and Tony Stevens. The first taped session occurred at the Nickolaus Exercise Center on January 26, 1974. They hoped that they would form a professional dance company to make workshops for Broadway dancers.

Michael Bennett was invited to join the group primarily as an observer, but quickly took control of the proceedings. Although Bennett&#x27;s involvement has been challenged, there has been no question about Kirkwood and Dante&#x27;s authorship. In later years, Bennett&#x27;s claim that &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; had been his brainchild resulted not only in hard feelings but a number of lawsuits as well. During the workshop sessions, random characters would be chosen at the end for the chorus jobs based on their performance quality, resulting in a different &quot;cast&quot; being selected every run-through. However, several of the costumers objected to this ending, citing the stress of having to change random actors in time for the finale. This resulted in the ending being cut in exchange for the same set of characters being &quot;cast.&quot; Marvin Hamlisch, who wrote &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;″s score, recalled how, during the first previews, audiences seemed put off by something in the story. This problem was solved when actress Marsha Mason told Bennett that Cassie (Donna McKechnie in the original production) should win the part in the end because she did everything right. Bennett changed it so that Cassie would always win the part.

===Original production===
&quot;A Chorus Line&quot; opened Off-Broadway at The Public Theater on April 15, 1975. At the time, the Public did not have enough money to finance the production so it borrowed $1.6 million to produce the show. The show was directed by Bennett and co-choreographed by Bennett and Bob Avian. Advance word had created such a demand for tickets that the entire run sold out immediately. Producer Joseph Papp moved the production to Broadway and on July 25, 1975, it opened at the Shubert Theatre, where it ran for 6,137 performances until April 28, 1990.

Additional cast members Carole Schweid and John Mineo were understudies named &quot;Barbara&quot; and &quot;Jarad&quot;, although they only went on covering other roles. Also, Tim Cassidy was an understudy for &quot;Bobby&quot; but was not in the original cast and didn’t join the Broadway cast until after several of the originals opened the LA and London companies.

The production was nominated for 12 Tony Awards, winning nine: Best Musical, Best Musical Book, Best Score (Hamlisch and Kleban), Best Director, and Best Choreography, Best Actress (McKechnie), Best Featured Actor (Sammy Williams), Best Featured Actress (Bishop) and Best Lighting Design. The show won the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, one of the few musicals ever to receive this honor, and the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Best Play of the season.

In 1976, many of the original cast went on to perform in San Francisco. Open roles were recast and the play was again reviewed as the &quot;&quot;New&quot; New York Company&quot; which included Ann Reinking, Marsha Mason, Sandahl Bergman, Christopher Chadman, Justin Ross (who would go on to appear in the film), and Barbara Luna.

When it closed, &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; was the longest running show in Broadway history until its record was surpassed by &quot;Cats&quot; in 1997. On September 29, 1983, Bennett and 332 &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; veterans gathered to celebrate the musical becoming the longest-running show in Broadway history.

Up to February 19, 1990, &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; had generated $146 million from its Broadway gross and $277 million in total U.S. grosses and had 6.5 million Broadway attendees. At the time, it was the second most profitable show in Broadway history after &quot;Cats&quot; with profits of $50 million (including ancillary income). 75% of the profits went to Papp&#x27;s New York Shakespeare Festival and 25% to Bennett&#x27;s Plum Productions. Since its inception, the show&#x27;s many worldwide productions, both professional and amateur, have been a major source of income for The Public Theater that Papp had founded.

===Subsequent productions===
U.S. and international tours were mounted in 1976, including a sit-down engagement in Los Angeles at the Shubert Theatre.

A London production opened in the West End at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in 1976, initially with the International Cast from the US, including Jane Summerhays as Sheila. The production ran for three years and won the Laurence Olivier Award as Best Musical of the Year in 1976, the first year the awards were presented. The original British cast took over in 1977. It included Jean-Pierre Cassel as Zach, Diane Langton as Diana Morales, Jeff Shankley as Al, Michael Staniforth as Paul, Stephen Tate as Greg (later replacing Cassel as Zach) and Geraldine Gardner (aka Trudi van Doorn of &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;) as Sheila. Elizabeth Seal was cast as Cassie but was replaced at the eleventh hour by her understudy Petra Siniawski who played the role for the entire British cast run.

The original Australian production opened in Sydney at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in May 1977 and moved to Melbourne&#x27;s Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in January 1978. The cast featured Peta Toppano as Diana, David Atkins as Mike, and Ross Coleman as Paul.

In 1980, under the direction of Roy Smith, the Teatro El Nacional of Buenos Aires produced a Spanish version of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; lasting 10 months (and then only to make way for an already scheduled subsequent production).

In Spain the show opened in December 1984 at Teatre Tívoli in Barcelona, directed by Roy Smith and translated into Spanish by Nacho Artime and Jaime Azpilicueta, before transferring to Teatro Monumental in Madrid.

In July 1986, &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; was produced in Italy for the first time. It premiered at the Nervi Festival of Dance in Genoa, followed by a five-week Italian tour. The choreography was adapted for the festival&#x27;s performing space by Baayork Lee who had played Connie in the original production and subsequently became a close collaborator of Michael Bennett, the original choreographer.

The German-language version was again directed by Lee and first opened in 1987 in Vienna, Austria, where it ran for one season followed by the German-language CD release produced by Jimmy Bowien in 1988.

The first—and as of 2016 only—professional Hungarian production of the musical opened its limited run on March 25, 1988, under the title &quot;&quot; (&quot;In Memory of Michael Bennett&quot;). It was performed by Ódry Színpad (the company of the Academy of Drama and Film in Budapest) translated into Hungarian by György Gebora, and directed by Imre Kerényi. The character Zach was renamed Michael and played by Kerényi.

The 2006 Broadway revival opened at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater on October 5, 2006, following a run in San Francisco. The revival closed on August 17, 2008, after 759 performances and 18 previews. It cost $8 million to finance and recouped its investment in 19 weeks. The production was directed by Bob Avian, with the choreography reconstructed by Baayork Lee, who had played Connie Wong in the original Broadway production. The opening night cast included Paul McGill, Michael Berresse, Charlotte d&#x27;Amboise, Mara Davi, James T. Lane, Tony Yazbeck, Heather Parcells, Alisan Porter, Jason Tam, Jessica Lee Goldyn, Deidre Goodwin, and Chryssie Whitehead. On April 15, 2008, Mario Lopez joined the cast as the replacement for Zach. The production was the subject of the documentary film &quot;Every Little Step&quot;.

The production received two Tony Award nominations in 2007 for Featured Role (Charlotte d&#x27;Amboise) and Revival (Musical). The original contract for &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; provided for sharing the revenue from the show with the directors and dancers that had attended the original workshop sessions. However, the contract did not specify revenue when the musical was revived in 2006. In February 2008, an agreement was reached between the dancers and Michael Bennett&#x27;s estate.

A 2008 U.S. touring production opened on May 4, 2008, at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts and toured through June 2009. This production featured Michael Gruber as Zach, Nikki Snelson as Cassie, Emily Fletcher as Sheila, and Gabrielle Ruiz as Diana.

In 2012, the musical toured Australia, gaining much critical acclaim. Baayork Lee directed the production and it gained many nominations, including Helpmann nominations for Best Actress in a Musical for West End star, Anita Louise Combe playing Cassie, Best supporting Actress in a musical, Deborah Krizak and Best supporting Actor in a musical, Euan Doidge and it won best musical. The same production and cast then came to Singapore, playing at the Marina Bay Sands, Sands Theater from May 4 to 27, 2012.

The show returned to London for a West End revival in February 2013 at the London Palladium, running through August of that year. It was directed by original choreographer Bob Avian, with John Partridge, Scarlett Strallen, and Victoria Hamilton-Barritt starring. James T. Lane is reprising his Broadway role and Leigh Zimmerman won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Supporting Role in a Musical for her portrayal of Sheila in this production. Producers announced on June 9, 2013, that the London revival cast would record a new cast album featuring never-before-heard songs which were written for the show but never made the final cut.

In 2015, the Original Broadway cast of &quot;Hamilton&quot; paid tribute to &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; 40th anniversary and performed &quot;What I Did For Love&quot;, with the original cast of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; joining them onstage.

Reports surfaced in June 2016 that a second Broadway revival is planned for 2025, in honor of the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

For its annual fully staged musical event, the Hollywood Bowl produced a limited run of A Chorus Line from July 29–31, 2016, directed and choreographed by Baayork Lee. The cast included Sabrina Bryan as Valerie Clark, Robert Fairchild as Mike Costa, Spencer Liff as Larry, Ross Lynch as Mark Anthony, Mara Davi as Maggie Winslow, J. Elaine Marcos as Connie Wong, Jason Tam as Paul San Marco, Leigh Zimmerman as Sheila Bryant, Mario Lopez as Zach, Sarah Bowden as Cassie Ferguson, Krysta Rodriguez as Diana Morales, and Courtney Lopez as Kristine Ulrich.

In 2016, approval was granted to director Donna Feore to allow changes in choreography so the show could be performed for the first time on a thrust stage, in the Festival Theatre at the Stratford Festival of Canada.

In 2018, New York City Center presented &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; as their annual gala presentation. The production was directed by Bob Avian, co-choreographer of the original 1975 production, and choreographed by Baayork Lee, Broadway&#x27;s original Connie Wong.

In 2019, a Spanish-language version of the musical premiered as part of the inaugural season of Teatro del Soho in Málaga, Spain, starring the theater&#x27;s founder Antonio Banderas as Zach. Banderas also co-directed the musical with Baayork Lee.

In 1975, the rights for a film were sold to Universal Pictures for $5.5 million plus 20% of the distributor&#x27;s gross rentals above $30 million. Universal subsequently sold the rights to PolyGram. The film was released in 1985, starring Michael Douglas as Zach. It also featured Alyson Reed and Terrance Mann as Cassie and Larry respectively. The film was directed by Richard Attenborough with a screenplay by Arnold Schulman. It was produced by Cy Feuer and distributed by Columbia Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Universal Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office bomb, grossing only $14 million from a $25 million budget. Songs &quot;Montage Part 1: Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love&quot; and &quot;Montage Part 4: Gimme The Ball&quot; were cut and replaced with &quot;Surprise, Surprise&quot;, a new song written by Marvin Hamlisch and Edward Kleban. &quot;The Music and the Mirror&quot; was also cut and replaced with &quot;Let Me Dance for You&quot;, written by Hamlisch and Kleban. &quot;What I Did for Love&quot; was sung by Cassie instead of Diana and was sung as a counterpart during &quot;The Tap Combination.&quot; Songs &quot;And...&quot;, and &quot;Sing!&quot; were cut entirely.

As Kelly Bishop, who played Sheila in the original Broadway cast, later noted, &quot;it was appalling when director Richard Attenborough went on a talk show and said &#x27;this is a story about kids trying to break into show business.&#x27; I almost tossed my TV out the window; I mean what an &quot;idiot!&quot; It&#x27;s about veteran dancers looking for one last job before it&#x27;s too late for them to dance anymore. No wonder the film sucked!&quot;

<text>The P-15 &quot;Termit (; ) is an anti-ship [[missile]] developed by the [[Soviet Union]]&#x27;s [[MKB Raduga|Raduga design bureau]] in the 1950s. Its [[GRAU]] designation was4K40, its [[NATO reporting name]] was Styx orSS-N-2. China acquired the design in 1958 and created at least four versions: theCSS-N-1 &quot;Scrubbrush and CSS-N-2 versions were developed for ship-launched operation, while the CSS-C-2 &quot;[[Silkworm missile|Silkworm]] andCSS-C-3 &quot;Seersucker were used for coastal defence. Other names for this basic type of missile include: HY-1, SY-1, and FL-1 &quot;Flying Dragon&quot; (Chinese designations typically differ for export and domestic use, even for otherwise identical equipment), North Korean local produced KN-1 or KN-01, derived from both Silkworm variants and Russian &amp; USSR P-15, Rubezh, P-20 P-22 .

Despite its large size, thousands of P-15s were built and installed on many classes of ships from torpedo boats to destroyers, and coastal batteries and bomber aircraft (Chinese versions).

==Origins==
The P-15 was not the first anti-ship missile in Soviet service; that distinction goes to the SS-N-1 &quot;Scrubber&quot;, and to the aircraft-launched AS-1 Kennel. The SS-N-1 was a powerful but rather raw system, and it was soon superseded by the SS-N-3 &quot;Shaddock&quot;. This weapon was fitted to 4,000-ton Kynda class cruisers and replaced an initial plan for 30,000-ton battlecruisers armed with and guns. Rather than rely on a few heavy and costly ships, a new weapons system was designed to fit smaller, more numerous vessels, while maintaining sufficient striking power. The P-15 was developed by the Soviet designer Beresyniak, who helped in the development of the BI rocket interceptor.

==Design==

The first variant was the P-15, with fixed wings. The basic design of the missile, retained for all subsequent versions, featured a cylindrical body, a rounded nose, two delta wings in the center and three control surfaces in the tail. It was also fitted with a solid-fueled booster under the belly. This design was based on the Yak-1000 experimental fighter built in 1951.

The weapon was meant to be cheap, yet still give an ordinary missile boat the same &#x27;punch&#x27; as a battleship salvo. The onboard electronics were based on a simple analog design, with a homing conical scanning radar sensor. It used a more reliable rocket engine with acid fuel in preference to a turbojet.

Some shortcomings were never totally solved, due to the liquid propellant of the rocket engine: the acid fuel gradually corroded the missile fuselage. Launches were not possible outside a temperature range of .

The missile weighed around , had a top speed of Mach 0.9 and a range of . The explosive warhead was behind the fuel tank, and as the missile retained a large amount of unburned fuel at the time of impact, even at maximum range, it acted as an incendiary device.

The warhead was a shaped charge, an enlarged version of a high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead, larger than the semi-armour piercing (SAP) warhead typical of anti-ship missiles. The launch was usually made with the help of electronic warfare support measures (ESM) gear and Garpun radar at a range of between due to the limits of the targeting system. The Garpun&#x27;s range against a destroyer was about .

The onboard sensor was activated at from impact, the missile would begin to descend at 1-2° to the target, because the flight pattern was about above sea level. In minimum range engagements there was the possibility of using active sensors at shorter distances, as little as .
The &quot;P-15U&quot; was introduced in 1965, with improved avionics and folding wings, enabling the use of smaller containers. It was replaced by the &quot;P-15M&quot; in 1972, which was a further development of the P-15U, with enhanced abilities (its export simplified variants were designated &quot;P-21&quot; and &quot;P-22&quot;, depending on the sensor installed, and a whole export system was designated the &quot;P-20M&quot;).

==Versions==
===Russia===
In total, the P-15 family had the following models:
*P-15: A basic (SS-N-2A) with I-band, a conical search sensor and range.
*P-15M: (SS-N-2C), heavier and longer than the P-15, it had a range of and several minor improvements.
*P-15MC: Essentially a P-15M, coupled with a Bulgarian-made electronic countermeasure package for that country&#x27;s navy.
*P-20: A P-15 updated with the new guidance system but with the original shorter range. They were perhaps known as SS-N-2B and used by &quot;Komar&quot; and &quot;Osa&quot; class boats.
*P-20K: A P-15M with a new guidance system.
*P-20M: A surface version of the P-20L with folding wings. This was the definitive version of the P-15M with radar guidance.
*P-22 other development of or along P-20; other variants P-21, P-27
*4K51 Rubezh and 4K40, SS-N-2C SSC-3 Styx, using P-20 and P-22, Self-propelled missile

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
===North Korea===
*KN-1 or KN-01 locally produced Geum Seong-1 Korean 금성-1호, derived from both Silkworm and Russian P-15 Termit, Rubezh, P-20 P-22 .

===Iraq===
In 1989, during the Baghdad International Exhibition for Military Production Iraq unveiled a series of coastal defense missiles under the name Faw, most likely built with technical assistance from Yugoslavia and some help from Egypt, China and the Soviet Union:
*Faw-70: A locally built version of the P-20 or P-21 missile with a warhead, minimum range of and maximum range of . An autopilot guided the missile mid-course while the terminal phase guidance was either an active I-band radar or a passive infrared depending on the seeker head used.
*Faw-150: An improved version of the Faw-70, with an increased length from to and enlarged fuel tanks extending maximum range to .
*Faw-200: Another extended-range variant of the Faw-70 with a length of and a maximum range of .

After the 1991 Gulf War, the Faw missile remained in service with the Iraqi Armed Forces, although it was largely obsolete prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

==Launch platforms==
This missile, despite its mass, was used in small and medium ships, from 60 to 4,000 tons, shore batteries and (only for derived models) aircraft and submarines. The main users were:
*Komar-class missile boats
*Osa-class missile boats
*Vidyut class missile boat (Indian version of OSA-1 class)
*Chamak class missile boat (Indian version of OSA-2 class)
*Tarantul-class corvettes
*Veer Class Corvette (Indian licence built version of Tarantul-class corvette)
*Nanuchka-class corvettes
*Koni-class frigates
*Kotor-class frigates
*The frigate &quot;Mărășești&quot;
*Kildin-class destroyers
*Kashin-class destroyers
*Rajput Class destroyers (Indian version of Kashin Class)

==Operational usage==

===Cuban Missile Crisis===
The first use of these weapons was in 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis. &quot;Komar&quot;-class missile boats were deployed in Operation &quot;Anadyr&quot; (&quot;Анадырь&quot;), organized by the Soviet Union to help the Castro government. At least eight were sent in cargo ships, due partly to their small dimensions and were presumably left to the Cuban Navy after the crisis, together with many other weapons of Soviet origin.
===War of Attrition===
During the War of Attrition, after the Six-Day War in 1967, the Israeli destroyer &quot;Eilat&quot; was sailing at low speed outside Port Said on 21 October. At a range of , she was attacked by two Egyptian &quot;Komars&quot;, acting as a coastal missile battery both fired their missiles from inside the harbour. &quot;Eilat&quot; was hit, despite defensive anti-aircraft fire. The first two missiles almost blew the &quot;Eilat&quot; in two; another hit soon after, and the last exploded near the wreck in the sea. &quot;Eilat&quot; sank two hours after the first attack. 47 crew were killed. After this engagement, interest in this type of weapon was raised in both offensive weapons and defensive weapons such as close-in weapon systems (CIWS) and electronic countermeasures (ECM).

===Indo-Pakistani War===

During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Indian &quot;Osa&quot;-class boats raided the port of Karachi in two highly successful operations causing severe damage and sinking several ships with their P-15s, among them the destroyer, &quot;Khaibar&quot;. She was a former Battle-class destroyer, originally designed as an anti-aircraft ship. Her armament might be effective against conventional air threats, (mounting 5 × 114 mm guns and several 40 mm Bofors), but had little chance against anti-ship missiles.

These raids were meant to strike Karachi and destroy the Pakistani Navy in Western Pakistan. The first action, Operation Trident, was carried out by three &quot;Osa&quot; class missile boats on the night of 5 December. &#x27;Operation Trident&#x27; involved:
*INS &quot;Nipat&quot; (Lt.-Cdr B.N Kavina, Vir Chakra (VrC))
*INS &quot;Nirghat&quot; (Lt.-Cdr I.J Sharma, Ati Vishisht Seva Medal (AVSM), VrC)
*INS &quot;Veer&quot; (Lt.-Cdr O.P Mehta, VrC, NM)

Around 20:30, a target was acquired by radar, at a distance of over , and &quot;Nirghat&quot; fired two missiles. This target was the destroyer &quot;Khaibar&quot;, sailing at . The crew of the ship saw a &quot;bright light&quot; in the sky, low on the water. Believing it to be the afterburner of a fighter aircraft, &quot;Khaibar&quot; opened fire with her Bofors guns, but these were not effective against such a small, fast target. The missile struck the starboard side at 22:45, destroying the electrical system. One of the boilers, possibly struck by the HEAT charge, also exploded. Despite thick smoke and a fire, &quot;Khaibar&quot; was still able to engage the second missile, again mistaking it for an enemy fighter. This missile struck the ship four minutes after the first, destroying and quickly sinking her.
During this action, &quot;Nipat&quot; attacked another two ships; the cargo vessel &quot;Venus Challenger&quot;, which was carrying ammunition from Saigon, was destroyed. Her escort, the destroyer PNS &quot;Shahjahan&quot; was severely damaged and later scrapped.

&quot;Veer&quot; then attacked &quot;Muhafiz&quot; at 23:05, (she was a minesweeper that had witnessed the attacks against &quot;Khaibar&quot;); she was hit and disintegrated, throwing most of the crew into the water before she sank.

&quot;Nipat&quot; fired two missiles at the port of Karachi. This is the first known use of an anti-ship missile against land targets. Large oil tanks, identified by radar, were hit by the first missile, destroying it, while the second weapon failed. Over the following nights there were other ship actions. Karachi was again attacked with missiles, while &quot;Petya&quot;-class frigates provided anti-submarine protection to the &quot;Osa&quot;-class boats.

On the night of 8 December, in the second operation, Operation Python, the &quot;Osa&quot;-class boat &quot;Vinash&quot;, escorted by two frigates, fired missiles at Karachi in a six-minute action. One missile hit an oil tank, destroying it. The British ship &quot;Harmattan&quot; was sunk, the Panamanian ship &quot;Gulfstar&quot; was set on fire. The Pakistan Navy fleet tanker, PNS &quot;Dacca&quot;, was badly damaged and only survived because the commanding officer, Captain. S.Q. Raza S.J. P.N., ordered the release of steam in the pipes that prevented the fire reaching the tanks. Though anti-aircraft guns opened fire in response, they only managed to hit a Greek ship, &quot;Zoë&quot;, that was moored in the port and consequently sank.

In all these actions against large ships, the P-15 proved to be an effective weapon, with a devastating warhead. Out of eleven missiles fired, only one malfunctioned, giving a 91% success rate. This gave every &quot;Osa&quot; FAC the possibility of striking several targets. Big ships, without any specialized defence, were targets for P-15s.

=== United States===
CIA inspected and analyzed data on Styx missiles from the guidance systems of missiles delivered to Indonesia. The US Navy had underestimated the threat of Soviet missiles, but after 1967 this changed. The US Navy thought that North Vietnam missile boats and coastal defenses using P-15 missiles could be met by US vessels off the coast and that ECM and air defense missiles would be effective countermeasures. The Soviet Union in fact decided not to supply P-15 missiles to North Vietnam, even though a promise to do so had been made in 1965.

In April 1972 the US Navy claimed to have been attacked by P-15 missiles during the Battle of Đồng Hới and they were shot down by Terrier missiles.

===Yom Kippur War===
Despite these early successes, the 1973 Yom Kippur War saw P-15 missiles used by the Egyptian and Syrian navies prove ineffective against Israeli ships. The Israeli Navy had phased out their old ships, building a fleet of Sa&#x27;ar-class FACs: faster, smaller, more maneuverable and equipped with new missiles and countermeasures.

Although the range of the P-15 was twice that of the Israeli Gabriel, allowing Arab ships to fire first, radar jamming and chaff degraded their accuracy. In the Battle of Latakia and Battle of Baltim, several dozen P-15s were fired and all missed. Arab ships did not possess heavy firepower required for surface combat against enemy vessels, usually only 25 and 30 mm guns, and &quot;Osa&quot; and &quot;Komar&quot; boats were not always able to outrun their Israeli pursuers.

===Iran–Iraq War===
P-15 variants, including the Chinese duplication &quot;Silkworm&quot;, were employed by Iran against Iraq in the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War, with some success. As the Iranian coastline is longer than Iraq&#x27;s, control of the Persian Gulf was relatively easy. Shore batteries with missiles can control a large part of this area, especially around the Hormuz Strait.

Iraq also acquired Silkworms, some with an IR homing ability. Iraqi OSA-class missile boats equipped with SS-N-2 used them against the IRIN navy, managed to hit and sink an Iranian Kaman-class fast attack craft, but sustained heavy losses, especially from Iranian Harpoons and Mavericks. Iraqi forces combined SS-N-2 (P-15 Termit) launched from Tu-22, Exocet missiles launched from Mirage F1 and Super Etendard, as well as Silkworm missiles and C-601 missiles launched from Tu-16 and H-6 bombers, bought from the Soviet Union and China to engage the Iranian Navy and tankers carrying Iranian oil.

=== Gulf War (1990–1991)===

During the First Gulf War the Iraqis fired two Silkworms against Coalition ships on 25 February 1991. One suffered a mechanical failure and crashed into the sea, while the other headed for battleship , which was escorting a fleet of minesweepers engaged in coastal anti-mine operations. USS Missouri launched flares and chaffs to spoof the missile while HMS &quot;Gloucester&quot; engaged the Silkworm with a salvo shot of Sea Dart missiles which destroyed it after it had flown over its initial target.

==Operators==

The P-15 missile family and their clones were widely deployed from the 1960s.

The German Navy, after reunification, gave its stock of almost 200 P-15s to the United States Navy in 1991, these weapons being mainly the P-15M/P-22. They were used for missile defence tests.

<text>Gérard D. Levesque (May 2, 1926 – November 17, 1993) was a longtime Quebec politician and Cabinet minister, who twice served as interim leader of the Quebec Liberal Party.

Levesque was first elected to what is now called the Quebec National Assembly in the riding of Bonaventure in 1956 and sat in the legislature continuously until the end of his life. Under Premier Jean Lesage he served as minister of housing and fisheries and then as minister for trade. In the first cabinet of Robert Bourassa, who came to power in 1970, he served in various capacities including minister of trade, Minister of Justice and deputy premier.

After the defeat of the Bourassa government in 1976, Levesque served as Leader of the opposition until 1979, while leaders Robert Bourassa and then Claude Ryan were without parliamentary seats. Levesque was noted for his fierce opposition to what was introduced as Bill 1, the Charter of the French Language; his procedural wrangling meant it had to be eventually reintroduced as Bill 101. Levesque was also interim leader of the party between Bourassa&#x27;s resignation and the election of Ryan. Levesque again served as Leader of the Opposition and acting leader of the party from August 1982 to September 1983 after the resignation of Ryan and until the return of Bourassa for his second stint as party leader.

In the second Bourassa government, elected in 1985, Levesque served as minister of finance, a position he held until his death in 1993 at the age of 67.

== In popular culture ==
