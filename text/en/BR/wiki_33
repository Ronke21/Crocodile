<text>Bucklebury is a village and civil parish in West Berkshire, England, about north-east of Newbury and north of the A4 road. The parish has a population of 2,116, but the village is much smaller. Bucklebury Common, with an area of over , is one of the largest commons in the ceremonial and historic county of Berkshire.

==Toponymy==
The place-name &quot;Bucklebury&quot; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Borgeldeberie&quot;, which means &quot;Burghild&#x27;s fortified place or borough&quot; (&quot;Burghild&quot; is a woman&#x27;s name).

==Geography==
The parish of Bucklebury has three main parts. The original village is on the banks of the River Pang close to its three sources in the parish. Directly south of Bucklebury village and on higher ground is Bucklebury Common, which is of open grazing on managed heather and woodland. The common is, under the Inclosure Acts, open to villagers only as commoners and privately owned. At the eastern boundary of the common is Chapel Row, incorporating local landmarks such as the Blade Bone public house, a doctors&#x27; surgery and a teashop.

The village of Upper Bucklebury became the parish&#x27;s largest residential area in the late 20th century. This is on a hill about a south-west of Bucklebury village at the western tip of the common. Upper Bucklebury has a general store, a public house, a modern Church of England church, All Saints, and a Church of England primary school.

The hamlet of Marlston is also in the parish. It is mostly fields, with a smaller area of woodland.

==History==
Bucklebury was a royal manor owned by Edward the Confessor (reigned 1042–66). The village and parish church are recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. Henry I (reigned 1100–35) granted Bucklebury to the Cluniac Reading Abbey, which retained it until it lost all its lands to the Crown with the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540.

Wooden bowl-making was &quot;still carried on&quot; in 1923 on or next to Bucklebury Common using its wood. Until 1950, such wood was also used by handle-maker Harry J. Wells. Over 100 tools used at his workshop at Heatherdene, Bucklebury Common are in the Museum of English Rural Life collection.

In the Second World War much of Bucklebury Common was cleared for the stationing of troops. Some of the concrete paths laid down still remain and are now used as bridleways.

==Notable buildings==
===Parish church===
The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary has a style consistent with being built in the second half of the 11th century. The ornate south doorway is late Norman and was added in about 1170. A north transept was added to the nave at the end of the 12th or beginning of the 13th century. Late in the 13th century, a second arch was added to turn the transept into a two-bay north aisle. One of the windows in the south wall of the nave was added in the 14th century.

In the 15th century, the nave and north aisle were lengthened westwards by adding a third bay, and new east and two new north windows were inserted in the north aisle. In the second half of the 15th century, the Perpendicular Gothic bell tower was added. The chancel was rebuilt in 1591 and the porch was added in 1603. The chancel was partly rebuilt again in 1705 and the porch has also been rebuilt. A vestry has also been added. The church contains tombs of the Winchcombe family. The whole structure is nationally listed for heritage/architecture in the highest category, Grade I.

The Rectory has an early 18th-century frontage. In 1966 the garden included two sculptures by Henry Moore: &quot;Draped Reclining Woman 1957–1958&quot; and &quot;Reclining Figure&quot; (1961–1962).

====Ministry and worship====
The ecclesiastical parish has very similar boundaries to the civil (secular) parish and gives its name to a benefice of three churches. This reaches into two parishes to the east to provide six churches, each with its own style of worship. A late December carol service and separate Christmas Eve and Christmas Day communions are held. 2bsd is the collective name for the churches of Bucklebury, Bradfield and Stanford Dingley. The parishes of Bucklebury with Marlston, Bradfield and Stanford Dingley from a group of rural parishes with six very different church buildings architecturally as well.

===Bucklebury House and estate===
The 1,600–acre (647 ha) agricultural Bucklebury manor estate was confiscated from Reading Abbey at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540 and granted to John Winchcombe (died 1557), who built himself a fine Elizabethan mansion. When it was owned by the Hartley family, a fire in 1830 destroyed the greater part of the house, which was later demolished. The parts left standing were the kitchen, with a huge fireplace, the brewhouse, and the stables, which had been rebuilt by Winchcombe&#x27;s descendant-in-law, Lord Bolingbroke in the early 18th century, although on the stables is a date 1626 with the initials H. W. for Henry Winchcombe (died 1642). 

After the fire, the family built themselves a smaller house on the estate, eventually called Bucklebury Manor, but for the most part they lived on their Gloucestershire estates instead. When the last of the Hartleys died in 1881, Bucklebury and the other family estates passed to four sisters: the Countess de Palatiano, Mrs Webley-Parry, Mrs Acreman White, and Mrs Charles Russell. Their families each became lords of the manor in turn and lived at the smaller Bucklebury Manor until 1957. In that year, Major Derrick Hartley Russell restored the remains of the old mansion to form the present Bucklebury House. His son, Willie, is the current lord of the manor.

===Bucklebury Manor===

This is a small Georgian country house on Pease Hill, which briefly served as the local manor house between 1906 and 1957. It is currently the home Michael and Carole Middleton, the parents of the Princess of Wales.

<doc id="517815" wikidata="Q1366992" url="?curid=517815" title="William Cornysh">
<text>William Cornysh the Younger (also spelled Cornyshe or Cornish) (1465 – October 1523) was an English composer, dramatist, actor, and poet.

==Life==
In his only surviving poem, which was written in Fleet Prison, he claims that he has been convicted by false information and thus wrongly accused, though it is not known what the accusation was. He may not be the composer of the music found in the &quot;Eton Choirbook&quot;, which may alternatively be by his father, also named William Cornysh, who died c. 1502. The younger Cornysh had a prestigious employment at court, as Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal; and being responsible for the musical and dramatic entertainments at court and during important diplomatic events such as at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520; and visits to and from the courts of France and the Holy Roman Empire, which he fulfilled until his death. He died in 1523, his birth date unknown.

==Musical works==
The &quot;Eton Choirbook&quot; (compiled c. 1490–1502) contains several works by Cornysh: &quot;Salve Regina&quot; (found in several other sources as well), &quot;Stabat mater&quot;, &quot;Ave Maria mater Dei&quot;, &quot;Gaude virgo mater Christi&quot;, and a lost &quot;Gaude flore virginali&quot;. The &quot;Caius Choirbook&quot; (c. 1518–1520) contains a &quot;Magnificat&quot;. Other sources refer to lost works: three Masses, another &quot;Stabat mater&quot;, another &quot;Magnificat&quot;, &quot;Altissimi potentia&quot;, and &quot;Ad te purissima virgo&quot;. He also produced secular vocal music and the notable English sacred anthem &quot;Woefully arrayed&quot;. There is also an extended and somewhat erudite three-part instrumental work based on steps of the hexachord and its mutations, &quot;Fa la sol&quot;, and another untitled piece. These secular works are found in the so-called &quot;Fayrfax Book&quot; (copied in 1501).

If all the earlier sacred music is by the same Cornysh (junior) as the secular music then he was a composer of some breadth, although not without parallel. The works by &quot;Browne&quot; in the &quot;Fayrfax Book&quot; display a similar difference in style to those by the John Browne of the &quot;Eton Choirbook&quot;, but are probably the same composer nonetheless. The occurrence of Cornysh&#x27;s &quot;Magnificat&quot; (in the same style as the Eton works) falls nearly two decades after the death of the older Cornysh, and thus is far more likely the work of the younger Cornysh, by then by far one of the country&#x27;s most important musicians. Furthermore, the works by Cornysh in the &quot;Eton Choirbook&quot; seem to be amongst the most &quot;modern&quot; in that collection. While they do not pursue the simplifying approach of Fayrfax (an almost exact contemporary of Cornysh junior, and fellow at Court and Chapel), and remain in a more old-fashioned florid melodic style, they adopt proto-madrigalian manners (for example in the setting of words like &quot;clamorosa&quot;, &quot;crucifige&quot; and &quot;debellandum&quot; in the &quot;Stabat mater&quot;) and have a particularly developed sense of tonal movement (for example, in the &quot;Stabat mater&quot;, the closing &quot;Amen&quot; features deliberate use of F sharps as leading notes to give a sense of tonal cadence into G, or employing E flats at &quot;Sathanam&quot; to give a tonal cadence onto B flat, emphasizing the &quot;strong&quot; nature of the text at that moment, employing the bass-movement V-I), as well as adopting a more modern sense of the expressive &quot;appoggiatura&quot; in melodic shapes and in bringing out the stresses of the Latin by such devices (for example, again the &quot;Stabat mater&quot;, the use of &quot;appoggiaturas&quot; in the Bassus part to express &quot;ContriSTANtem et doLENtem&quot; in the first few measures, and again at &quot;Contemplari doLENtem cum filio?&quot;), and the use of purely rhetorical gestures (such as the exclamation &quot;O&quot; by full choir in the middle of the soloists&#x27; section starting the &quot;Stabat mater&quot;). It is not impossible to see in these mannerisms the work of a great dramatist.

The works of John Browne are given pride of place in the Eton manuscript. It seems that in the examples given above that Cornysh may have been emulating Browne (his own &quot;Stabat mater&quot; features a celebrated madrigalian setting of &quot;crucifige&quot;, and his &quot;O Maria salvatoris Mater&quot; features the exclamation &quot;En&quot; (=&quot;Oh&quot;) in a similar way to Cornysh&#x27;s interjection in his &quot;Stabat mater&quot;).

Thus it seems that the Eton Cornysh was writing after Browne, and this would place his work amongst the later ones of the &quot;Eton Choirbook&quot;: additionally the approaches do not seem to be those of an older man, being much more suggestive of a young and original composer. The traditional ascription of all the works to Cornysh junior is the one more generally accepted. However, the possibility that the Eton works are the works of a generation earlier remains, and has interesting implications if true.

The musicologist David Skinner, in the booklet to The Cardinall&#x27;s Musick&#x27;s CD &quot;Latin Church Music&quot;, puts forward the proposition that the pre-Reformation Latin church music (including the works in the Eton manuscript) was composed by the father, whilst the son is the composer of the pieces in English and the courtly songs.

Beginning after the American Civil War, the job of Pullman porter had become an important means of work by African-Americans. The leaders of the BSCP—including A. Philip Randolph, its founder and first president, Milton Webster, vice president and lead negotiator, and C. L. Dellums, vice president and second president—became leaders in the Civil Rights Movement, especially concerning fair employment and continued to play a significant role in the movement after it focused on the eradication of segregation in the Southern United States. BSCP members such as E. D. Nixon were among the leadership of local desegregation movements by virtue of their organizing experience, constant movement between communities, and freedom from economic dependence on local authorities.

As a result of a decline in railway transportation in the 1960s, BSCP membership declined. It merged in 1978 with the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks (BRAC), now known as the Transportation Communications International Union.

==The Pullman Company==
In the 1920s and 1930s the Pullman Company was one of the largest single employers of black people and had created an image for itself of enlightened benevolence via financial support for black churches, newspapers, and other organizations. It also paid many porters well enough to have a middle-income lifestyle and prominence within their own communities.

Working for the Pullman Company was, however, less glamorous than the image the company promoted. Porters depended on tips for much of their income and thus on the generosity of white passengers who often referred to all porters as &quot;George&quot;, the first name of George Pullman, the company&#x27;s founder (see also Society for the Prevention of Calling Sleeping Car Porters &quot;George&quot;). The company required porters to travel 11,000 miles, nearly 400 hours, per month to earn a basic wage. In 1934, porters on regular assignments worked an average of over 73 hours per week and earned 27.8 cents an hour while workers in manufacturing jobs averaged under 37 hours per week and earned an average of 54.8 cents per hour. They spent roughly ten percent of their time in unpaid &quot;preparatory&quot; and &quot;terminal&quot; set-up and clean-up duties, and they had to pay for their food, lodging, and uniforms, which could consume up to half of their wages. They were also charged whenever their passengers stole a towel or a water pitcher. Porters could ride at half fare on their days off—but not on Pullman coaches. They were not eligible for promotion to conductor, a job reserved for whites, despite frequently performing some of the conductor duties.

The company had squelched any efforts they made to organize during the first decades of the 20th century by isolating or firing union leaders. Like many other large companies of the time, the company employed spies to keep tabs on their employees; in extreme cases, company agents assaulted union organizers.

When 500 porters met in Harlem on August 25, 1925, they decided to make another effort to organize. During this meeting, they secretly launched their campaign, choosing Randolph, not employed by Pullman and thus beyond retaliation, to lead the effort. The union chose a motto to sum up their resentment over the working conditions: &quot;Fight or Be Slaves&quot;.

==Organizing the union==
The AFL, despite touting equal rights for workers, was actively discriminatory. Furthermore, and foremost, white supremacy remained entrenched in almost every institution that existed in the US, and these racist beliefs, both subtle and overt, precluded the white labor movement from recognizing the black workers or their organized fronts.

In the 1920s, as some elements within the AFL began to lower these barriers, groups as diverse as the Urban League, the Socialist Party of America and Communist Party began to focus on the rights of black workers. Randolph himself was a prominent member of the Socialist Party. From its inception, the BSCP fought to open doors in the organized labor movement in the US for black workers, even though it faced staunch opposition and blatant racism. As BSCP co-founder and First Vice President Milton Price Webster, put it, &quot;...any time we have an American institution composed of white people there is prejudice in it...In America, if we should stay out of everything that&#x27;s prejudiced we wouldn&#x27;t be in anything.&quot;

As early as 1900, efforts were put forth by various collectives of Pullman porters to organize the porters into a union, each effort having been crushed by Pullman. In 1925, in the early days of organizing the BSP union, Randolph was invited, by BSCP union organizer Ashley Totten, to address the Porters Athletic Association, in New York City. Exhibiting a sound understanding of the plight of the black worker and the need for a genuine labor union, Randolph was asked to undertake the job of organizing the porters into a bona fide labor union. The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters was launched on the night of August 25, 1925.

Key to the success of the union was to galvanize membership by way of a national membership drive, with three of the Pullman company&#x27;s largest terminals being most important—Chicago, Oakland, and St. Louis. The man to see in Chicago was Milton Price Webster. He was the son of enslaved parents from Clarksville, Tennessee, who, after successfully purchasing their own freedom, eventually moved to Chicago, where Webster was raised. A former Pullman Porter of twenty years, and a devoted husband (Louie Elizabeth Harris) and father of three, Webster had been fired by the company for attempting to organize porters in the Railroad Men&#x27;s Benevolent Association.

Webster was a man of strong convictions. As a Lincoln Republican and a tenured, highly respected captain of Chicago&#x27;s Sixth Ward black Republican machine, Webster was a stern, but gregarious leader of men who was well connected throughout the Chicago politic. Not the orator of Randolph&#x27;s skill, and not college educated, Webster devoured books and the news of the day, and was a stalwart back room negotiator. He captured his audience with his command of the subject, his keen wit and sharp intellect, and his commitment to alleviating the struggles of the working man.

Although skeptical of Randolph&#x27;s socialist affiliations, on the recommendations of fellow union organizer John C. Mills of Chicago, Webster facilitated a series of public meetings for Randolph and Chicago porters, nightly for two weeks. At the initial meeting, after hearing Randolph speak, Webster turned to Mills, agreeing that Randolph was the man to head the organization of the new union. For the next two weeks, nightly meetings were held, with two speakers campaigning for Chicago chapter membership—Milton Webster opening and A. Philip Randolph closing—effectively launching the Chicago division of the Brotherhood.

The Pullman Company&#x27;s response was to denounce, with support from the ministers and African American newspapers whom it had cultivated (or bought), the new union as an outside entity motivated by foreign ideologies, while sponsoring its own company union, variously known as the Employee Representation Plan or the Pullman Porters and Maids Protective Association, to represent its loyal employees. Local authorities, such as Boss Crump in Memphis, Tennessee in some cases helped the company by interfering with or banning BSCP meetings.

For the first several years of its existence, the union continued fighting the Pullman Company, its allies in the black community, the white power structure, and rival unions within the AFL that were hostile to its members&#x27; job claims. The BSCP also tried to involve the federal government in its fight with the Pullman Company: on September 7, 1927, the brotherhood filed a case with the Interstate Commerce Commission, requesting an investigation of Pullman rates, porters&#x27; wages, tipping practices, and other matters related to wages and working conditions; the ICC ruled that it did not have jurisdiction.

While it had organized roughly half of the porters within the company, the union was seemingly no closer to obtaining recognition than it had been in 1925. By 1928 BSCP leaders decided that the only way to force the issue was to strike the company. The leadership was, however, divided on what a strike could accomplish: some rank-and-file leaders wanted to use the strike as a show of strength and an organizing tool, while Randolph was more cautious, hoping to use the threat of a strike as the lever to get the federal National Mediation Board established pursuant to the Railway Labor Act to bring the Pullman Company to the table while mobilizing support from supporters outside the industry.

After secretly meeting with the Pullman Company, the NMB refused to follow precedent it had set in the case of a group of white railroad workers, and refused to act on behalf of the BSCP. The NMB argued that the brotherhood was incapable of disrupting the Pullman sleeping car service. Although the union had voted for a strike, the Pullman Company convinced the NMB that the union did not have the strength in numbers or resources to pull it off. In July 1928, the NMB formally retired the case and Randolph called off the strike just hours before it was scheduled to begin. Randolph, Webster, and the leadership of the BSCP recognized, in the end, that a strike at that time would have seriously crippled the brotherhood, agreeing that the union was still not strong enough to carry off a strike against the powerful corporate giant like Pullman.

That provoked an internal crisis, deepened by the Great Depression, paucity of funding for the union, and perpetual reprisals against the porters by the Pullman company, which led to a sharp drop in BSCP membership. The union might have disappeared altogether if it had not been for the vigilance and dedication of Randolph, Webster, Totten, Mills, C. L. Dellums, Bennie Smith, S. E. Grain, E. J. Bradley, Paul Caldwell, George Price, C. Francis Stratford and Roy Lancaster, who formed the initial organizers and board members of the BSCP.

The relationship between Randolph and Webster, the long-standing first vice president of the BSCP and the head of the Chicago Division, was centered on their common devotion to a common cause. Together they had a mutually aggressive and genuine commitment to the imperative that the black worker be organized to improve the working conditions, workers rights and the lives of black workers, their families and their communities.

In 1929, the American Federation of Labor granted affiliated status to individual chapters of the BSCP as local unions rather than to the international organization as a whole. The locals were Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Fort Worth, Kansas City, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Oakland, St. Louis, St. Paul, and Washington, D.C.

By 1933, BSCP membership dropped to 658, and the headquarters lost telephone and electric service because of nonpayment of bills. In 1934 the Roosevelt administration amended the RLA, then passed the Wagner-Connery Act, which outlawed company unions and covered porters, the following year. The BSCP immediately demanded that the NMB certify it as the representative of these porters. The BSCP defeated the company union in the election held by the NMB and on June 1, 1935, was certified.

Negotiations for increasing labor standards with the Pullman Company began but were repeatedly deadlocked. The BSCP requested the assistance of the National Mediation Board in April 1937, a time when the company was still using informants to report on union meetings.

A contract between the BSCP and the Pullman Company was signed on August 25, 1937. It went into effect in October 1937, raising the wages of porters and maids, establishing a basic 240-hour month, and providing time-and-a-half overtime pay after 260 hours. Pullman claimed the wage increases would cost the company approximately $1,500,000 per year. The company also agreed to pay for the uniforms of porters after they&#x27;d been employed for ten years.

==Role of women==
The BSCP was founded for all Pullman attendants, including maids. Many of the maids were well-educated African-American or Chinese-American women but were classified as &quot;unskilled service workers,&quot; expected to clean berths, care for the unwell, and give free manicures to passengers.

Six weeks after the foundation of the BSCP, female Pullman employees and relatives of male union members formed the Women&#x27;s Economic Councils, officially recognized as the International Ladies&#x27; Auxiliary to the BSCP in 1938. Many of these women had worked in New York&#x27;s booming garment industry and gained experience in union activism within the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union, which sought to increase African-American membership in the late 1920s. This adjunct organization focused on fundraising and disseminating pro-union information to the general public. Maids were often fired for union activism.

Individuals also made impacts. When her husband was fired due to his BSCP work, Rosina C. Tucker successfully demanded his reinstatement; she later became a founding member of the ILA, a recruiter for the BSCP, and a civil rights activist in Washington, D.C. Halena Wilson (1895–1975), president of the Chicago ILA, pushed the chapter to fight for wage and price controls and consumer cooperatives and against poll taxes. Frances Albrier organized her fellow Pullman maids during the 1920s, recalling: &quot;Our responsibility was trying to educate the black public and black women&quot; about the union.

==International growth==
During 1917–1939 working conditions on Canadian railways and transportation industries were poor. Porters working under the Canadian National Railways (CNR) began resistance movements, demanding representation and bargaining rights.

In 1942, the union expanded divisions into the Canadian cities of Montreal, Toronto and Winnipeg followed later by Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver. There was widespread enthusiasm amongst Canadian workers for the adoption of BSCP. Just three years after expanding to Canadian provinces, the work of the BSCP brought about reforms in wages, working standards among other matters, while expanding the number of workers represented by the union.

==Civil rights leadership==
The BSCP won a charter from the AFL in 1935, the same year it was certified by the NMB. In the years before then, when the AFL refused to recognize the organization itself, Randolph accepted &quot;federal local&quot; status for a number of locals of the BSCP—an unsatisfactory compromise that assumed that these locals had no union of their own, and allowed them to affiliate directly with the AFL on that basis. That half-measure, however, allowed Randolph into AFL conventions and other meetings, where he advocated organization of black workers on an equal footing with whites. Randolph kept the BSCP in the AFL, where most of the railroad brotherhoods remained, after John L. Lewis led the split that resulted in the formation of the Congress of Industrial Organizations.

Randolph expanded his agenda once he became the leader of the foremost black labor organization in the US. Randolph was chosen as the leader of the National Negro Congress, an umbrella organization founded in 1937 that united many of the major black civil rights organizations of the day. Randolph later resigned from the NNC in a dispute over policy with communist activists within it. The NNC went into eclipse, while Randolph&#x27;s stature continued to grow.

In 1941 he used the threat of a march on Washington and support from the NAACP, Fiorello La Guardia and Eleanor Roosevelt to force the administration to ban discrimination by defense contractors and establish the Fair Employment Practices Committee to enforce that order. Milton Webster, the BSCP&#x27;s First Vice-president, worked to make the FEPC an effective tool in combatting employment discrimination. Randolph achieved his other demand—the end of racial segregation within the military—seven years later, when President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9981 banning it.

BSCP members played a significant role in the Civil Rights Movement in the 1940s and 1950s. E. D. Nixon, a BSCP member and the most militant spokesperson for the rights of African Americans in Montgomery, Alabama for most of the 1940s and 1950s, exemplified the leadership that the union provided. Nixon could take advantage of his experience organizing under difficult circumstances and his immunity to economic reprisals from local businesses and authorities. BSCP members also helped spread information and create networks between the different communities their work took them to, bringing the newspapers and political ideas they picked up in the North back to their hometowns.

Randolph helped negotiate the return of the CIO to the AFL in 1955. Randolph by that time had achieved elder statesman status within the civil rights movement, even as changes in the railroad industry were gradually displacing many of the union&#x27;s members.

Randolph and one of his chief lieutenants, Bayard Rustin—who, ironically, had bitterly criticized Randolph for calling off the 1941 March on Washington—were the moving force behind the 1963 March on Washington. As Randolph said from the podium at that march:Let the nation know the meaning of our numbers. We are not a pressure group. We are not an organization. We are not a mob. We are the advance guard of a massive moral revolution that is not confined to the Negro, nor is it confined to civil rights, for our white allies know that they are not free while we are not.In 1953, when Violet King Henry became the first black woman lawyer in Canada (and the first black law graduate in Alberta) the union&#x27;s president and vice-president traveled to Alberta to recognize her.

==Merger with BRAC==
Passenger rail travel dropped sharply after its peak in the 1940s, when the BSCP had 15,000 members, to the 1960s, when only 3000 porters had regular runs. After four decades of service as the first vice president of the BSCP, Milton Webster was designated to be Randolph&#x27;s successor as president when Randolph retired. That transition never occurred. In February 1965, Webster suffered a fatal heart attack in the lobby of the Americana Hotel in Bal Harbour, Florida while he and Randolph were attending an AFL-CIO Convention. C. L. Dellums replaced Randolph as president of the BSCP in 1968.

The BSCP merged with the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks (BRAC) a decade later. Dellums&#x27; successor and last president of the BSCP as an independent organization, Leroy J. Shackelford, became president of BRAC&#x27;s Sleeping Car Porters Division. In 1984, the Sleeping Car Porters Division was combined, along with Amtrak clerical employees, into a new Amtrak Division of the union having approximately 5000 members, 3500 clerical and 1500 in on-board services, comprising the largest single unit of organized labor on the Amtrak system.

Upon Mr. Shackelford&#x27;s retirement in 1985, his position was not filled, its duties devolving upon the general chairman of the BRAC Amtrak Division, Michael J. Young, and his successors. Thus ended the direct lineage of BSCP leadership, with Young becoming the first non-African American to lead the on-board group.

The three unions representing Amtrak on-board service workers, BRAC, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees (HERE), and the Transport Workers Union (TWU) joined to form the Amtrak Service Workers Council (ASWC). Craft lines and separate seniority lists for on-board workers were eliminated, with one labor agreement covering all. The chairmanship of the ASWC rotates annually among the chief executive officers of each constituent union&#x27;s Amtrak bargaining unit.

==Stage and film==
In 1982 an award-winning documentary was produced titled &quot;Miles of Smiles, Years of Struggle&quot;. An oral history book of the same name inspired by and based on the film was produced several years later.

The story of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters was made into the 2002 Robert Townsend film &quot;10,000 Black Men Named George&quot; starring Andre Braugher as A. Philip Randolph.

The play &quot;Pullman Porter Blues&quot; (2012) by Cheryl West dramatizes a night aboard the Panama Limited train and the challenges and tensions among three generations of Pullman Porters.

&quot;The Porter&quot; (2022) is an 8-part CBC and BET television drama. It is a work of fiction partly inspired by the creation of the BSCP.

<text>Avesnes-sur-Helpe (; ), Picard: &quot;Avinne-su-Helpe&quot;) is a commune in the Nord department in northern France. It is a sub-prefecture of the Nord department. It is situated 14 km from the Belgian border, and 18 km south of Maubeuge, the nearest larger town. The river Helpe Majeure, a tributary of the Sambre, flows through the town. Upstream of Avesnes on the river there is the Lac du Val-Joly, an artificial lake.

==History==
Avesnes was founded in the 11th century. The first known lord was Wedric II of Avesnes (born about 990), son of Wedric I de Morvois. The house of Avesnes played an important role in the low countries, including several Counts of Holland. It was destroyed by Louis XI in 1477 after his victory in the Burgundian Wars. Historically a part of the County of Hainaut, it became French in 1659 as a result of the Treaty of the Pyrenees, and was fortified by Vauban, although it was captured by Prussia in 1815.

Avesnes was heavily fortified, with fortifications that were continually modernised, from the 11th century up until 1867 when its fortifications, like those of other isolated bastions, were deemed to be redundant. In the 1870 some of the fortifications were demolished to allow easier access to the town.

==Population==
==Culture==
Many of the buildings on the main streets in this town are made of dimension stone, like the 200 ft bell tower of the main church, St Nicholas, which dates from the 16th century.

The Tour de France race cycled through town in its 1999 progression around France.

The region of Avesnes-Sur-Helpe is known for its distinctive cheeses: the Maroilles cheese and also the &quot;boule d&#x27;Avesnes&quot;, a local cone-shaped red cheese that is coated in paprika.

The high school in the region is the Lycée Jesse de Forest, named for an Avesnes native son who was responsible for the earliest settlement of the Dutch and Huguenots in what is now New York.

<doc id="517833" wikidata="Q5508750" url="?curid=517833" title="Funbox">
<text>A funbox is a standard element of a skatepark. It generally consists of a box shape with a flat top and a ramp on two or more sides. A funbox may also include other elements that allow for more complicated skateboarding tricks.

Like other skatepark features, funboxes are used by skateboarders, roller skaters using inline skates or quad skates, and BMX-riders.

==Features==

Table-top - The main characteristic of a funbox is the standard table-top; the flat top of the main structural &quot;box&quot; component. The table-top can vary in height and surface area.

Ramps - To allow access to the table-top, a funbox will generally be surrounded (on two or more sides) by ramps or stairs to allow tricks or transitions on, off or over the table-top.

Other elements - A funbox may also include a number of other elements including ledges, rails, spines, copings, angled ramps, wall sections to allow &quot;wallrides&quot; and improvised street furniture pieces.

A funbox with ramps on opposite sides may allow for the conduct of aerial tricks. As such, funboxes are commonly placed in line with the &quot;outlet&quot; of a larger ramp to allow for a build-up of speed. Typically, a funbox with ramps or transitions on all sides of the table will be placed in the middle of a park.

==Construction==

Funboxes are generally constructed of concrete (as a permanent element in a skatepark) or wood (as a moveable or customizable element for street skateboarding). Some variations include steel frames and both concrete and wood constructions will often include steel copings or rails. Some funboxes will be constructed in sections to allow for further customization.

The construction must resist dynamic structural load resulting from aerial tricks or jumps onto the funbox.

<doc id="517835" wikidata="Q715848" url="?curid=517835" title="Claude Berrou">
<text>Claude Berrou (; born 23 September 1951 in Penmarch) is a French professor in electrical engineering at École Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications de Bretagne, now IMT Atlantique. He is the sole inventor of a groundbreaking quasi-optimal error-correcting coding scheme called turbo codes as evidenced by the sole inventorship credit given on the fundamental patent for turbo codes. The original patent filing for turbo codes issued in the US as US Patent 5,446,747.

A 1993 paper entitled &quot;Near Shannon Limit Error-correcting Coding and Decoding: Turbo-codes&quot; published in the Proceedings of IEEE International Communications Conference was the first public disclosure of turbo codes. This 1993 paper listed three authors because it was formed from three separate submissions that were combined due to space constraints. The three authors listed on the 1993 paper are: Berrou, Glavieux, and Thitimajshima. Because the 1993 paper was the first public introduction of turbo codes (patents remain unpublished until issued), coinventorship credit for the discovery to turbo code is often erroneously given to Glavieux and/or Thitimajshima. While Berrou and Glavieux did go on to do supplemental work together, the original development of turbo codes was performed by Berrou alone.

Berrou also codeveloped turbo equalization (see turbo equalizer.) Turbo equalization is also known as iterative reception or iterative detection.

Turbo codes have been used in all the major cellular communications standards since 3G and are currently part of the LTE (Long Term Evolution) cellular protocol. They are also used in the Inmarsat satellite communications protocol and well as the DVB-RCS and DVB-RCS2 communications protocols.

Hard disk drives started using turbo equalization for their read channel in 2008. By 2012 all hard disk drives used turbo equalization and this remains the case to this day.

In 2009, he was elected as an IEEE fellow for invention of turbo codes, generalization of the turbo principle in receivers, and influence in standardization.

Between mobile phones and hard disk drives, several billion devices have incorporated key technology developed by Claude Berrou.

== Key research activities ==
His current research activities are now concentrated on the application and extension of the &quot;turbo&quot; technology in various domains, including his research on &quot;artificial thinking&quot;, because turbo decoding has been recognized as a new instance of the very general principle of belief propagation; one application of this principle has been invented for the decoding of low-density parity-check codes (LDPC codes also known as &quot;Gallager codes&quot;, in honor of Robert G. Gallager, who developed the LDPC concept in his doctoral dissertation at MIT in 1960 as a theoretical model whose practical implementation was not widely developed until recently). The &quot;turbo&quot; principle is generalized now by Claude Berrou and his lab team for the processing of various functions such as the demodulation, the detection or the equalization using a network of multiple convolution codes working in parallel with probabilistic feedback.

Other subjects of interest include all their possible applications in the field of artificial intelligence, for example with a better understanding of natural biological thinking and memory for the implementation of such model using neural networks for the processing of pulsed signals with software and hardware methods with auto-selected and self-maintained combinations of activation cycles of adjacent neurons.

== Publications ==
He is the author or coauthor of several books related to turbocodes and their encoding/decoding methods or implementation devices:
* &quot;Codes et turbocodes&quot; (Codes and turbo codes) by Claude Berrou with Karine Amis Cavalec, Alain Glavieux, Matthieu Arzel, Michel Jezequel, Charlotte Langlais, Raphaël Le Bidan, Samir Saoudi, Gérard Battail, Emmanuel Boutillon, Yannick Saouter, Emeric Maury, Christophe Laot, Sylvie Kerouedan, Frédéric Guilloud, and Catherine Douillard.

Paris: Hermès Science / Lavoisier (2005), 453 p. (&quot;Traité IC2 : Traitement du signal et de l’image&quot;), .

He wrote many chapters in various books related to turbocodes in US publications, published several articles in various international research magazines with scientific review committees, and made many communications in international conferences with review committees.

During his work on turbocodes and parallel convolutive encoding and decoding, he has authored several registered patents for methods and devices implementing this technology:

<doc id="517844" wikidata="Q834471" url="?curid=517844" title="Bones (studio)">
<text>is a Japanese animation studio. It has produced numerous series, including &quot;RahXephon&quot;, &quot;No. 6&quot;, &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Rain&quot;, &quot;Scrapped Princess&quot;, &quot;Eureka Seven&quot;, &quot;Angelic Layer&quot;, &quot;Darker than Black&quot;, &quot;Soul Eater&quot;, &quot;Ouran High School Host Club&quot;, both the 2003 and 2009 adaptations of &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;, &quot;Star Driver&quot;, &quot;Gosick&quot;, &quot;Mob Psycho 100&quot;, &quot;Space Dandy, Noragami&quot;, &quot;Bungo Stray Dogs&quot;, and &quot;My Hero Academia&quot;. Its headquarters are located in Igusa, Suginami, Tokyo.

==History==
Bones was founded by Sunrise staff members Masahiko Minami, Hiroshi Ōsaka and Toshihiro Kawamoto in October 1998. One of their first projects was collaborating with Sunrise on &quot;Cowboy Bebop: Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;, a feature film based on the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; anime series.

In 2007, the studio suffered the loss of co-founder Hiroshi Ōsaka, well known for his works as character designer on series such as &quot;Mobile Suit Victory Gundam&quot;, &quot;Mobile Fighter G Gundam&quot; and &quot;The Mars Daybreak&quot;. Ōsaka had been battling with cancer, and died from the disease on September 24, 2007. He was 44 years old.

After the death of Ōsaka, two new additions have been made to the studio&#x27;s board of directors: Makoto Watanabe and Takahiro Komori. Komori is well known as a character designer and animator who has been with the studio since its inception. His previous works as designer consist of &quot;Angelic Layer&quot;, &quot;Scrapped Princess&quot;, and &quot;Darker than Black&quot;.

In 2024, Bones spun-off its production division under a separate, wholly-owned subsidiary known as Bones Film.

==Studios==
Like studio Sunrise, where some of its founders previously worked, Bones is divided into smaller studios which are focused on their own anime projects.

*Studio A: Led by producer Naoki Amano and mainly known for &quot;Gosick&quot;, &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Rain&quot;, &quot;Angelic Layer&quot;, &quot;Hiwou War Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Noragami&quot; and &quot;Carole &amp; Tuesday&quot;.
*Studio B: Mainly known for &quot;Eureka Seven&quot;, &quot;RahXephon&quot;, &quot;Space Dandy&quot;, and &quot;Mob Psycho 100&quot;.
*Studio C: Led by producer Yoshihiro Oyabu; It&#x27;s known for &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;, &quot;Darker than Black: The Black Contractor&quot;, &quot;Soul Eater&quot; and &quot;Ouran High School Host Club&quot;. It&#x27;s currently working exclusively on &quot;My Hero Academia&quot;.
*Studio D: Led by Mari Suzuki and mainly known for &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood&quot; and &quot;No. 6&quot;. Since 2015, it works on &quot;Bungo Stray Dogs&quot;.
*Studio E: The newest studio, led by Makoto Watanabe and mainly known for the &quot;Eureka Seven: Hi-Evolution&quot; trilogy and &quot;Metallic Rouge&quot;.

<text>Vsevolod Illarionovich Pudovkin (; 28 February 1893 – 30 June 1953) was a Soviet film director, screenwriter and actor who developed influential theories of montage. Pudovkin&#x27;s masterpieces are often contrasted with those of his contemporary Sergei Eisenstein, but whereas Eisenstein utilized montage to glorify the power of the masses, Pudovkin preferred to concentrate on the courage and resilience of individuals. He was granted the title of People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR in 1948.

==Biography==
Vsevolod Pudovkin was born in Penza into a Russian family, the third of six children. His father Illarion Yepifanovich Pudovkin came from peasants of the Penza Governorate, the village of Shuksha and worked in several companies as a manager and a door-to-door salesman. Vsevolod&#x27;s mother Yelizaveta Aleksandrovna Pudovkina (née Shilkina) was a housewife.

A student of engineering at Moscow University, Pudovkin saw active duty during World War I, being captured by the Germans. During this time he studied foreign languages and did book illustrations. After the war, he abandoned his professional activity and joined the world of cinema, first as a screenwriter, actor and art director, and then as an assistant director to Lev Kuleshov.

In 1924, he married Anna Zemtsova. Pudovkin asserted that his wife encouraged him for pursuing a career as a filmmaker.

His first notable work was a comedy short &quot;Chess Fever&quot; (1925) co-directed with Nikolai Shpikovsky. José Raúl Capablanca played a small part in it, with a number of other cameos presented. In 1926 he directed what would become one of the masterpieces of silent movies: &quot;Mother&quot;, where he developed several montage theories that would make him famous. Both movies featured Pudovkin&#x27;s wife Anna Zemtsova in supporting female parts (she left cinema shortly after).

His first feature was followed by &quot;The End of St. Petersburg&quot; (1927), and &quot;Storm over Asia&quot; (also known as &quot;The Heir of Genghis Khan&quot;, 1928), titles which compose a trilogy at the service of the bolshevik revolutionary policy.

In 1928, with the advent of sound film, Pudovkin, Sergei Eisenstein and Grigori Aleksandrov signed the Manifest of Sound, in which the possibilities of sound are debated, and always understood as being in a state of tension and nonsynchronization with the image. This idea would be brought to bear in his next pictures: &quot;A Simple Case&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Deserter&quot; (1933), works that do not match the quality of earlier work. The Heir to Genghis Khan (or Storm over Asia; 1928). Pudovkin was publicly charged with formalism for his experimental sound film &quot;A Simple Case&quot;, which he was forced to release without its sound track. In 1935 he was awarded the Order of Lenin.

After an interruption caused by health concerns, Pudovkin returned to movie making, this time with a number of historical epics: &quot;Victory&quot; (1938); &quot;Minin and Pozharsky&quot; (1939) and &quot;Suvorov&quot; (1941). The last two were often praised as some of the best movies based on Russian history, along with the works of Sergei Eisenstein. Pudovkin was awarded a Stalin Prize for both of them in 1941.

During World War II he was evacuated to Kazakhstan where he directed several patriotic war movies. He also played a small part in the &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; movie (as God&#x27;s fool). With the end of war he returned to Moscow and continued his work at the Mosfilm studio, making biographical and war movies. In 1947 he was awarded another Stalin Prize for his work on &quot;Admiral Nakhimov&quot;, and in 1950 — his second Order of Lenin and a third Stalin Prize for &quot;Zhukovsky&quot;. His last work was &quot;The Return of Vasili Bortnikov&quot; (1953).

Apart from directing, screenwriting and acting, Pudovkin was also an educator and a journalist, author of several books on film theory, professor at VGIK, president of the cinema section at VOKS (since 1944) and a member of the Soviet Peace Committee.

Vsevolod Pudovkin died on 30 June 1953 in Dubulti, Latvian SSR after a heart attack. He was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery. One of the streets in Moscow is named after Pudovkin (see Pudovkin street).

<doc id="517862" wikidata="Q1533272" url="?curid=517862" title="Harry Helmsley">
<text>Harry Brakmann Helmsley (March 4, 1909 – January 4, 1997) was an American real estate billionaire whose company, Helmsley-Spear, became one of the country&#x27;s biggest property holders, owning the Empire State Building and many of New York&#x27;s most prestigious hotels. His second marriage to Leona Roberts (&quot;Queen of Mean&quot;) led to charges of false accounting and tax evasion as well as a celebrated trial, where Harry was judged too frail to plead, but Leona was fined and jailed.

==Early career==
Harry Helmsley was the son of Henry Helmsley, a wholesale dry goods buyer, and the former Minnie Brakmann. He was born in Manhattan and brought up in The Bronx, attending Evander Childs High School, where he did not graduate. The family could not afford a college education, but his grandfather got him a job as an office boy in a real estate firm, Dwight, Voorhis &amp; Perry, where he showed a keen talent for the business and was made a partner. In 1938, he bought the firm, renaming it Dwight, Voorhis &amp; Helmsley. In the early stages of his career, his portfolio consisted mainly of smaller properties in less-affluent parts of New York City, though it was extensive and highly profitable.

==Notable properties and companies==

In 1954, Helmsley bought the Lincoln Building, a major office skyscraper on Forty-second Street. A year later, he bought a real estate management company owned by Leon Spear, and the firm became known as Helmsley-Spear.

In 1961, Helmsley bought the Empire State Building—then the tallest building in the world—despite warnings that the maintenance costs would be too high. Other notable New York office properties that Helmsley owned during his career included the Helmsley Building (230 Park Avenue), the Graybar Building (420 Lexington Avenue), the Flatiron Building (175 Fifth Avenue), the Fisk Building (250 West 57th Street), the Toy Center (200 Fifth Avenue) and 1350 Broadway. He also invested in large residential properties including Park West Village on Manhattan&#x27;s west side, Tudor City on the east side, and in Fresh Meadows in Queens and Parkchester in the Bronx. Industrial properties included the Starrett-Lehigh Building in Manhattan and Bush Terminal in the Bronx.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Helmsley began investing in hotels. Among his holdings were the Helmsley Windsor Hotel (West 58th Street), the Park Lane Hotel (Central Park South) and the Helmsley Palace, which he built behind the Villard Houses on Madison Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets.

In addition to Helmsley-Spear, which had 450 employees by 1980, he also owned Brown Harris Stevens, Inc., a residential brokerage firm. Helmsley bought Brown Harris Stevens in 1964. In addition to its high-end residential brokerage business, the company managed residential buildings, including some of the most prestigious co-ops on Park and Fifth Avenues and Central Park West. When Helmsley sold the business in 1995, the company managed 128 buildings.

Helmsley became known as the most influential real estate magnate in the city. In addition to his activities in Manhattan, in the early 1970s Helmsley built the Palace on Brickell, a 254-unit residential condominium tower located along Miami&#x27;s prestigious Brickell Avenue. 

Helmsley&#x27;s success was attributed largely to a gift for salesmanship, a willingness to delegate authority, and a less-usual acquisition policy of long-term fixed-rate mortgages during a slump and cash purchases when interest rates were low. This policy has since become standard in real estate.

==Marriage to Leona==
In 1938, he had married a widow, Eve Ella Sherpick Green. In 1971, he divorced her and the next year married Leona Roberts, vice-president of one of his many companies. She was a high-profile manager, dynamic but abrasive (&quot;Queen of Mean&quot;), and she demanded a luxurious lifestyle, quite unlike the modest private life he had been living until then. Basing themselves in a penthouse in the Helmsley-owned Park Lane Hotel on Central Park South, they moved into hotel construction and operation on a big scale, diversifying beyond New York for the first time, to many other big centres. Their portfolio included The Helmsley Middletowne Hotel, the New York Helmsley Hotel (also known as the New York Harley), The Helmsley Windsor Hotel, the St. Moritz (now the Ritz-Carlton), the Carlton House hotels, the Harley Hotel chain and The Helmsley Building in New York City.
In 1980, Harry received The Hundred Year Association of New York&#x27;s Gold Medal Award &quot;in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.&quot;

His crown jewel was New York&#x27;s 50-story Helmsley Palace Hotel on Madison Avenue at Fiftieth Street. The hotel opened in 1980 to great fanfare and soon became known as the city&#x27;s most elegant venue. However, it marked the beginning of financial and legal troubles that would dog the marriage until Harry&#x27;s death. Partly due to Leona&#x27;s extravagant plans and frequent demands for changes, the cost of the building skyrocketed, and it was proved that they had contracted some work out to their own subsidiaries at inflated prices. In 1988, they were also charged with major tax evasion based on false accounting. By this time, Harry was judged too frail to plead but Leona served 18 months in prison, in addition to being heavily fined.

==Death==
Helmsley died of pneumonia at age 87 at a hospital in Scottsdale, Arizona, and left all of his empire ($5.5 billion) to his wife, Leona. His remains were initially entombed at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York, but later moved to Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

==In popular culture==
Helmsley&#x27;s marriage to Leona was dramatized in the 1990 TV movie &quot;Leona Helmsley: The Queen of Mean&quot;, which starred Lloyd Bridges as Harry and Suzanne Pleshette as Leona. Pleshette was nominated for an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for the portrayal.

<text>São Francisco is one of the 48 neighborhoods in which the Brazilian city of Niterói is divided. As of 2000, its population was 9,654.

Its name derives from the church consecrated to Saint Francis Xavier (in Portuguese: São Francisco Xavier) and references to it can be found as early as the 17th century. The &quot;São Francisco Ensenada&quot;, also known as &quot;saco&quot; de São Francisco&quot; (roughly translated as São Francisco&#x27;s &quot;bag&quot;, on account of the Ensenada&#x27;s shape), was an important source of fish for both the Indians and the Portuguese.

In the 19th century, an important road existed, connecting the neighborhood of Icaraí, across the &quot;Morro do Cavalão&quot; (Big Horse Hill), to Charitas and then across the &quot;Morro da Viração&quot; (Viração Hill) to Piratininga, on the Ocean shore (note that Icaraí, São Francisco and Charitas have their shores on the Guanabara Bay).

The population of approximately 9,620 (in 1991) represents 2.21% of Niterói&#x27;s total population. No slums exist in the neighborhood.

The São Francisco waterfront is famous for its concentration of bars, restaurants and night clubs, being the beating heart of Niterói&#x27;s nightlife.

<text>The Pittsburgh Crawfords, popularly known as the Craws, were a professional Negro league baseball team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The team, previously known as the Crawford Colored Giants, was named after the Crawford Bath House, a recreation center in the Crawford neighborhood of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Hill District.

In 1931 Gus Greenlee, an African-American businessman in Pittsburgh, bought the Crawfords. In 1933 he founded what is known as the second Negro National League, and built Greenlee Field as a ball park for his team. During the mid-1930s, the Crawfords were one of the strongest Negro league teams ever assembled.

== History ==

As Richard L. Gilmore recounts in a 1996 article on the history of the team, the Crawfords began as an interracial team of local Hill District youth who played ball together in neighborhood sandlots. Resident families included black migrants from the South and European immigrants, all of whom were attracted to industrial jobs in the city.

As the Hill District teams became more competitive and professionalized, lines of color were drawn. The teams became formalized initially through the efforts of Bill Harris (originally of Calhoun, Alabama) and Teenie Harris (no relation), who managed teams that emerged from local Hill schools. Bill Harris played with a team, which he later managed, from McKelvey High School, while Teenie&#x27;s team formed from the Watt School. Twice the teams faced off resulting in a marginal win for Teenie&#x27;s team in both games, prompting the two managers to join forces and create a predominantly black team.

Greenlee bought the team in 1931. It was a time of an organizational vacuum, as the major African-American leagues of the 1920s, the Negro National League and the Eastern Colored League, had fallen apart under pressures of the Great Depression. By late that year, Greenlee signed many of the top African-American stars to his team, most notably Satchel Paige. The next year, in 1932, Greenlee hired Hall of Famer Oscar Charleston as playing manager, and added Hall of Famers Josh Gibson, Judy Johnson, and Cool Papa Bell, along with other notable players such as William Bell, Jimmie Crutchfield, Rap Dixon, Sam Bankhead, and Ted Radcliffe. Playing as an independent club, the Crawfords immediately established themselves as perhaps the best black team in the United States.

The Crawfords played in the new Greenlee Field, named after the owner and builder; this was one of the few parks to be built and owned by a Negro League team. Paige and Gibson often unwound at the Crawford Grill, one of black Pittsburgh&#x27;s favorite night spots, where the likes of singers Lena Horne and Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson entertained.

== League play ==

In 1933, Greenlee founded a new Negro National League, acting as president; his Crawfords were charter members. The club narrowly lost the first-half title to the Chicago American Giants; both teams claimed the second-half title, and Greenlee as league president awarded it to his Crawfords. The matter of the overall pennant was apparently never decided. The next season, as Gibson led the league with 16 home runs and Paige won 20 games, the Crawfords were near the top of the overall standings, but won neither half. Records of all games against league opponents, not just those considered official league games, show the Crawfords with far and away the best record for 1934.

In 1935, Paige skipped most of the NNL season to play for a semipro team in North Dakota. Despite his absence, the Crawfords took the first-half title with a 26–6 record, then defeated the New York Cubans in a close seven-game series for their only undisputed NNL pennant. In retrospect, many historians consider this edition of the Crawfords to be the greatest Negro league team of all time, featuring the four Hall of Famers, plus left-handed pitcher Leroy Matlock, who won 18 games without a defeat.
After a mediocre first half (16–15) in 1936, the Crawfords rallied to win the NNL&#x27;s second half with a 20–9 record. Paige had returned, and contributed an 11–3 record. The playoff with the first-half winners, the Washington Elite Giants, apparently only lasted one game (the Elite Giants winning, 2–0) before it was called off for unknown reasons. Greenlee awarded the pennant to the Crawfords, over Washington&#x27;s protests.

== Player defections ==
In 1937, Paige led several Crawfords players, including Gibson, Bell, and Bankhead to the Dominican Republic to play for the dictator Rafael Trujillo&#x27;s team. The Crawfords plunged to fifth place out of six teams with a 12–16 record. They partly recovered the next season, finishing third with a 24–16 record, but, with the exception of the 41-year-old Charleston, whose playing career was nearly over, the heart of the old Crawfords&#x27; team—Paige, Gibson, Bell—had all moved on to other teams.

== Demise ==
The Craws might have survived these losses, but their attendance flatlined after the white members of the team&#x27;s board forced Greenlee to shut out blacks from jobs at Greenlee Field (ushers, ticket-takers, etc.). Greenlee sold the club, Greenlee Field was demolished and the Crawfords moved to Toledo and the Negro American League, becoming the Toledo Crawfords, for the 1939 season. For the 1940 season, the team split their home games between Toledo and Indianapolis, becoming the Toledo–Indianapolis Crawfords, before folding after season.

=== Later revival ===
In 1945, Greenlee formed a new, unrelated, Pittsburgh Crawfords in Branch Rickey&#x27;s new United States League. The league and the new Crawfords lasted two seasons.

<doc id="517874" wikidata="Q671054" url="?curid=517874" title="Punch line">
<text>A punch line (also punch-line or punchline) concludes a joke; it is intended to make people laugh. It is the third and final part of the typical joke structure. It follows the introductory framing of the joke and the narrative which sets up for the punch line.

In a broader sense, &quot;punch line&quot; can also refer to the unexpected and funny conclusion of any performance, situation or story.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the term is unknown. Even though the comedic formula using the classic &quot;set-up, premise, punch line&quot; format was well-established in Vaudeville by the beginning of the 20th century, the actual term &quot;punch line&quot; is first documented in the 1910s; the Merriam-Webster dictionary pegs the first use in 1916.

== Linguistic analysis ==
A linguistic interpretation of the mechanics of the punch line response is posited by Victor Raskin in his script-based semantic theory of humor. Humor is evoked when a trigger, contained in the punch line, causes the audience to abruptly shift its understanding of the story from the primary (or more obvious) interpretation to a secondary, opposing interpretation. &quot;The punch line is the pivot on which the joke text turns as it signals the shift between the [semantic] scripts necessary to interpret [re-interpret] the joke text.&quot; To produce the humor in the verbal joke, the two interpretations (i.e., scripts) need to be both compatible with the joke text &quot;and&quot; opposite or incompatible with each other. Thomas R. Shultz, a psychologist, independently expands Raskin&#x27;s linguistic theory to include &quot;two stages of incongruity: perception and resolution&quot;. He explains that &quot;incongruity alone is insufficient to account for the structure of humour. [...] Within this framework, humour appreciation is conceptualized as a biphasic sequence involving first the discovery of incongruity followed by a resolution of the incongruity.&quot; Resolution generates laughter.

=== Prosodic features ===
There are many folk theories of how people deliver punchlines, such as punchlines being louder and at a higher pitch than the speech preceding it, or a dramatic pause before the punchline is delivered. In laboratory settings, however, none of these changes are employed at a statistically significant level in the production of humorous narratives. Rather, the pitch and loudness of the punchline are comparable to those of the ending of any narrative, humorous or not.

=== Jokes without a punch line ===
In order to better elucidate the structure and function of the punch line, it is useful to look at some joke forms that purposely remove or avoid the punch line in their narrative. Shaggy dog stories are long-winded anti-jokes in which the punch line is deliberately anticlimactic. The humor here lies in fooling the audience into expecting a typical joke with a punch line. Instead they listen and listen to nothing funny and end up themselves as the butt of the joke.

Another type of anti-joke is the nonsense joke, defined as having &quot;a surprising or incongruous punch line&quot;, which provides either no resolution at all or only a partial, unsatisfactory resolution. One example of this is the no soap radio punch line: &quot;Two elephants were taking a bath. One said, &#x27;Please pass the soap.&#x27; The other replied, &#x27;No soap, radio.&#x27;&quot; Here the anticipated resolution to the joke is absent and the audience becomes the butt of the joke.

== Jab lines ==
A joke contains a single story with a single punch line at the end. In the analysis of longer humorous texts, an expanded model is needed to map the narratological structure. With this in mind, the general theory of verbal humor (GTVH) was expanded to include longer humorous texts together with jokes, using the GTVH narrative structure to categorize them. A new term &quot;jab line&quot; was introduced to designate humor within the body of a text, as opposed to the punch line, which is always placed at the end. The jab line is functionally identical to the punch line, except that it can be positioned anywhere within the text, not just at the end. &quot;Jab and punch lines are semantically indistinguishable (...), but they differ at a narratological level.&quot; Additionally, &quot;jab lines are humorous elements fully integrated in the narrative in which they appear (i.e., they do not disrupt the flow of the narrative, because they either are indispensable to the development of the &#x27;plot&#x27; or of the text, or they are not antagonistic to it)&quot;.

Using the expanded narrative structure of the GTVH and this new terminology of jab lines, literature and humor researchers now have a single theoretical framework, with which they can analyze and map any kind of verbal humor, including novels, short stories, TV sitcoms, plays, movies as well as jokes.

== Three-part structure ==
Felicitous jokes are often formatted in a style called AAB, (referred to as an A-A-A&#x27; triad by Yves Lavandier in Writing Drama) where a joke is made up of a set of three, the first two of which share some common attribute, and the third represents a deviation from that attribute. Under these conditions, the third item in the set—the B—is the punchline.

Rozin gives the following example as exemplifying this structure:
According to this theory, the punchline is always the deviation, and it does not matter how many instances of A occur for there to be a punchline. However, jokes following the AAB structure are consistently rated as being funnier than their AB or AAAB counterparts.

<text>The Hexateuch (&quot;six scrolls&quot;) is the first six books of the Hebrew Bible: the Torah (&quot;Pentateuch&quot;) and the book of Joshua.

==Overview==
The term &quot;Hexateuch&quot; came into scholarly use from the 1870s onwards mainly as the result of work carried out by Abraham Kuenen and Julius Wellhausen. Following the work of Eichhorn, de Wette, Graf, Kuenen, Nöldeke, Colenso and others, in his &quot;Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels&quot; Wellhausen proposed that Joshua represented part of the northern Yahwist source (&quot;c&quot; 950 BC), detached from JE document by the Deuteronomist (&quot;c&quot; 650–621) and incorporated into the Deuteronomic history, with the books of Judges, Kings, and Samuel.

Reasons for this unity, in addition to the presumed presence of the other documentary traditions, are taken from comparisons of the thematic concerns that underlie the narrative surface of the texts. For instance, the &quot;Book of Joshua&quot; stresses the continuity of leadership from Moses to Joshua. Furthermore the theme of &quot;Joshua&quot;, the fulfillment of God&#x27;s promise to lead the Israelites to the Promised Land, complements the thematic material of the Pentateuch, which had ended with the Israelites on the border of the Promised Land ready to enter.

The thesis that &quot;Joshua&quot; completes the Torah in a &quot;Hexateuch&quot; may be contrasted with the view of scholars following the older rabbinic tradition, expressed by the compilers of the Jewish Encyclopedia (compiled between 1901 and 1906), that the Pentateuch is a complete work in itself. The thesis may also be contrasted with the view put forward by Eduard Meyer (1855–1930) that there never was any &quot;Hexateuch&quot; per se, but that the Law (that is, the Torah), &quot;Joshua&quot;, &quot;Judges&quot;, &quot;Samuel&quot;, and &quot;Kings&quot; all together once formed one great historic work.

<text>Liver transplantation or hepatic transplantation is the replacement of a diseased liver with the healthy liver from another person (allograft). Liver transplantation is a treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure, although availability of donor organs is a major limitation. Liver transplantation is highly regulated, and only performed at designated transplant medical centers by highly trained transplant physicians. Favorable outcomes require careful screening for eligible recipients, as well as a well-calibrated live or deceased donor match.

== Medical uses ==

Liver transplantation is a potential treatment for acute or chronic conditions which cause irreversible and severe (&quot;end-stage&quot;) liver dysfunction. Since the procedure carries relatively high risks, is resource-intensive, and requires major life modifications after surgery, it is reserved for dire circumstances.

Judging the appropriateness/effectiveness of liver transplant on case-by-case basis is critically important (&quot;see Contraindications&quot;), as outcomes are highly variable.

The Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD score) for adults and the Pediatric End Stage Liver Disease (PELD score) for children younger than 12 years old are clinical scoring tools that take various clinical criteria into consideration and are used to assess the need for a liver transplant. Higher scores for each clinical scoring tool indicates a higher severity of liver disease, and thus a greater need for a liver transplant. In those with chronic liver disease, a decompensating event such as hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, ascites, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis may also signal a new need for a liver transplant.

== Contraindications ==
Although liver transplantation is the most effective treatment for many forms of end-stage liver disease, the tremendous limitation in allograft (donor) availability and widely variable post-surgical outcomes make case selection critically important. Assessment of a person&#x27;s transplant eligibility is made by a multi-disciplinary team that includes surgeons, medical doctors, psychologists and other providers.

The first step in evaluation is to determine whether the patient has irreversible liver-based disease which will be cured by getting a new liver. Thus, those with diseases which are primarily based outside the liver or have spread beyond the liver are generally considered poor candidates. Some examples include:
* someone with advanced liver cancer, with known/likely spread beyond the liver. Or those with cancer of any type, if the cancer cannot be treated successfully without rendering them unsuitable for transplant (other than skin cancers).
* active illicit substance use
* anatomic abnormalities that prevent liver transplantation
* severe heart/lung disease, whether it is primary heart/lung disease, or brought on by the liver disease (unless the team thinks they can still proceed)
* HIV/AIDS, especially if it is not well-managed (some persons with HIV/AIDS that have very low or undetectable viral loads could still be eligible)

Importantly, many contraindications to liver transplantation are considered reversible; a person initially deemed &quot;transplant-ineligible&quot; may later become a favorable candidate if the circumstances change. Some examples include:
* partial treatment of liver cancer, such that risk of spread beyond liver is decreased (for those with primary liver cancer or secondary spread to the liver, the medical team will likely rely heavily on the opinion of the patient&#x27;s primary provider, the oncologist, and the radiologist)
* cessation of substance use (time period of abstinence is variable)
* improvement in heart function, e.g. by percutaneous coronary intervention or bypass surgery
* treated HIV infection (&quot;see Special populations&quot;)

Other conditions, including hemodynamic instability requiring vasopressor support, large liver cancers or those with invasion to blood vessels, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, frailty, fulminant liver failure with suspected brain injury, alcohol use disorder with recent alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, inadequate social support, and nonadherence to medical management may disqualify someone from liver transplantation, however these cases are usually evaluated by the multi-disciplinary transplant team on an individual basis.

== Risks/complications ==
===Graft rejection===
After a liver transplantation, immune-mediated rejection (also known as rejection) of the allograft may happen at any time. Rejection may present with lab findings: elevated AST, ALT, GGT; abnormal liver function values such as prothrombin time, ammonia level, bilirubin level, albumin concentration; and abnormal blood glucose. Physical findings may include encephalopathy, jaundice, bruising and bleeding tendency. Other nonspecific presentation may include malaise, anorexia, muscle ache, low fever, slight increase in white blood count and graft-site tenderness.

Three types of graft rejection may occur: hyperacute rejection, acute rejection, and chronic rejection.
* Hyperacute rejection is caused by preformed anti-donor antibodies. It is characterized by the binding of these antibodies to antigens on vascular endothelial cells. Complement activation is involved and the effect is usually profound. Hyperacute rejection happens within minutes to hours after the transplant procedure.
* Acute rejection is mediated by T cells (versus B-cell-mediated hyperacute rejection). It involves direct cytotoxicity and cytokine mediated pathways. Acute rejection is the most common and the primary target of immunosuppressive agents. Acute rejection is usually seen within days or weeks of the transplant.
* Chronic rejection is the presence of any sign and symptom of rejection after one year. The cause of chronic rejection is still unknown, but an acute rejection is a strong predictor of chronic rejections.

===Biliary complications===
Biliary complications include biliary stenosis, biliary leak, and ischemic cholangiopathy. The risk of ischemic cholangiopathy increases with longer durations of cold ischemia time, which is the time that the organ does not receive blood flow (after death/removal until graft placement). Biliary complications are routinely treated with Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), percutaneous drainage, or sometimes re-operation.

===Vascular complications===
Vascular complications include thrombosis, stenosis, pseudoaneurysm, and rupture of the hepatic artery. Venous complications occur less often compared with arterial complications, and include thrombosis or stenosis of the portal vein, hepatic vein, or &quot;vena cava&quot;.

== Technique ==
Before transplantation, liver-support therapy might be indicated (bridging-to-transplantation). Artificial liver support like liver dialysis or bioartificial liver support concepts are currently under preclinical and clinical evaluation. Virtually all liver transplants are done in an orthotopic fashion; that is, the native liver is removed and the new liver is placed in the same anatomic location. The transplant operation can be conceptualized as consisting of the hepatectomy (liver removal) phase, the anhepatic (no liver) phase, and the postimplantation phase. The operation is done through a large incision in the upper abdomen. The hepatectomy involves division of all ligamentous attachments to the liver, as well as the common bile duct, hepatic artery, all three hepatic veins and portal vein. Usually, the retrohepatic portion of the inferior vena cava is removed along with the liver, although an alternative technique preserves the recipient&#x27;s vena cava (&quot;piggyback&quot; technique).

The donor&#x27;s blood in the liver will be replaced by an ice-cold organ storage solution, such as UW (Viaspan) or HTK, until the allograft liver is implanted. Implantation involves anastomoses (connections) of the inferior vena cava, portal vein, and hepatic artery. After blood flow is restored to the new liver, the biliary (bile duct) anastomosis is constructed, either to the recipient&#x27;s own bile duct or to the small intestine. The surgery usually takes between five and six hours, but may be longer or shorter due to the difficulty of the operation and the experience of the surgeon.

The large majority of liver transplants use the entire liver from a non-living donor for the transplant, particularly for adult recipients. A major advance in pediatric liver transplantation was the development of reduced size liver transplantation, in which a portion of an adult liver is used for an infant or small child. Further developments in this area included split liver transplantation, in which one liver is used for transplants for two recipients, and living donor liver transplantation, in which a portion of a healthy person&#x27;s liver is removed and used as the allograft. Living donor liver transplantation for pediatric recipients involves removal of approximately 20% of the liver (Couinaud segments 2 and 3).

Further advance in liver transplant involves only resection of the lobe of the liver involved in tumors and the tumor-free lobe remains within the recipient. This speeds up the recovery and the patient stay in the hospital quickly shortens to within 5–7 days.

Radiofrequency ablation of the liver tumor can be used as a bridge while awaiting liver transplantation.

=== Cooling ===
Between removal from donor and transplantation into the recipient, the allograft liver is stored in a temperature-cooled preservation solution. The reduced temperature slows down the process of deterioration from normal metabolic processes, and the storage solution itself is designed to counteract the unwanted effects of cold ischemia. Although &quot;static&quot; cold storage method has long been standard technique, various dynamic preservation methods are under investigation. For example, systems which use a machine to pump blood through the explanted liver (after it is harvested from the body) during a transfer have met some success (&quot;see Research section for more&quot;).

=== Living donor transplantation ===

Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has emerged in recent decades as a critical surgical option for patients with end stage liver disease, such as cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma often attributable to one or more of the following: long-term alcohol use disorder, long-term untreated hepatitis C infection, long-term untreated hepatitis B infection. The concept of LDLT is based on (1) the remarkable regenerative capacities of the human liver and (2) the widespread shortage of cadaveric livers for patients awaiting transplant. In LDLT, a piece of healthy liver is surgically removed from a living person and transplanted into a recipient, immediately after the recipient&#x27;s diseased liver has been entirely removed.

Historically, LDLT began with terminal pediatric patients, whose parents were motivated to risk donating a portion of their compatible healthy livers to replace their children&#x27;s failing ones. The first report of successful LDLT was by Silvano Raia at the University of São Paulo Faculty of Medicine in July 1989. It was followed by Christoph Broelsch at the University of Chicago Medical Center in November 1989, when two-year-old Alyssa Smith received a portion of her mother&#x27;s liver. Surgeons eventually realized that adult-to-adult LDLT was also possible, and now the practice is common in a few reputable medical institutes. It is considered more technically demanding than even standard, cadaveric donor liver transplantation, and also poses the ethical problems underlying the indication of a major surgical operation (hemihepatectomy or related procedure) on a healthy human being. In various case series, the risk of complications in the donor is around 10%, and very occasionally a second operation is needed. Common problems are biliary fistula, gastric stasis and infections; they are more common after removal of the right lobe of the liver. Death after LDLT has been reported at 0% (Japan), 0.3% (USA) and &lt;1% (Europe), with risks likely to decrease further as surgeons gain more experience in this procedure. Since the law was changed to permit altruistic non-directed living organ donations in the UK in 2006, the first altruistic living liver donation took place in Britain in December 2012.

In a typical adult recipient LDLT, 55 to 70% of the liver (the right lobe) is removed from a healthy living donor. The donor&#x27;s liver will regenerate approaching 100% function within 4–6 weeks, and will almost reach full volumetric size with recapitulation of the normal structure soon thereafter. It may be possible to remove up to 70% of the liver from a healthy living donor without harm in most cases. The transplanted portion will reach full function and the appropriate size in the recipient as well, although it will take longer than for the donor.

Living donors are faced with risks and/or complications after the surgery. Blood clots and biliary problems have the possibility of arising in the donor post-op, but these issues are remedied fairly easily. Although death is a risk that a living donor must be willing to accept prior to the surgery, the mortality rate of living donors in the United States is low. The LDLT donor&#x27;s immune system does diminish as a result of the liver regenerating, so certain foods which would normally cause an upset stomach could cause serious illness.

==== Donor requirements ====

Any member of the family, parent, sibling, child, spouse or a volunteer can donate their liver. The criteria
for a liver donation include:
* Being in good health
* Having a blood type that matches or is compatible with the recipient&#x27;s, although some centres now perform blood group incompatible transplants with special immunosuppression protocols.
* Having a charitable desire of donation without financial motivation
* Being between 20 and 60 years old (18 to 60 years old in some places)
* Have an important personal relationship with the recipient
* Being of similar or larger size than the recipient
* Before one becomes a living donor, the donor must undergo testing to ensure that the individual is physically fit, in excellent health, and not having uncontrolled high blood pressure, liver disease, diabetes or heart disease. Sometimes CT scans or MRIs are done to image the liver. In most cases, the work up is done in 2–3 weeks.

====Complications====
Living donor surgery is done at a major center. Very few individuals require any blood transfusions during or after surgery. All potential donors should know there is a 0.5 to 1.0 percent chance of death. Other risks of donating a liver include bleeding, infection, painful incision, possibility of blood clots and a prolonged recovery. The vast majority of donors enjoy complete and full recovery within 2–3 months.

====Pediatric transplantation====

In children, living liver donor transplantation has become very accepted. The accessibility of adult parents who want to donate a piece of the liver for their children/infants has reduced the number of children who would have otherwise died waiting for a transplant. Having a parent as a donor also has made it a lot easier for children – because both patients are in the same hospital and can help boost each other&#x27;s morale.

====Benefits====
There are several advantages of living liver donor transplantation over cadaveric donor transplantation, including:
* Transplant can be done on an elective basis because the donor is readily available
* There are fewer possibilities for complications and death than there would be while waiting for a cadaveric organ donor
* Because of donor shortages, UNOS has placed limits on cadaveric organ allocation to foreigners who seek medical help in the USA. With the availability of living donor transplantation, this will now allow foreigners a new opportunity to seek medical care in the USA.

====Screening for donors====
Living donor transplantation is a multidisciplinary approach. All living liver donors undergo medical evaluation. Every hospital which performs transplants has dedicated nurses that provide specific information about the procedure and answer questions that families may have. During the evaluation process, confidentiality is assured on the potential donor. Every effort is made to ensure that organ donation is not made by coercion from other family members. The transplant team provides both the donor and family thorough counseling and support which continues until full recovery is made.

All donors are assessed medically to ensure that they can undergo the surgery. Blood type of the donor and recipient must be compatible but not always identical. Other things assessed prior to surgery include the anatomy of the donor liver. However, even with mild variations in blood vessels and bile duct, surgeons today are able to perform transplantation without problems. The most important criterion for a living liver donor is to be in excellent health.

=== Post-transplant immunosuppression ===
Like most other allografts, a liver transplant will be rejected by the recipient unless immunosuppressive drugs are used. The immunosuppressive regimens for all solid organ transplants are fairly similar, and a variety of agents are now available. Most liver transplant recipients receive corticosteroids plus a calcineurin inhibitor such as tacrolimus or ciclosporin, (also spelled cyclosporine and cyclosporin) plus a purine antagonist such as mycophenolate mofetil. Clinical outcome is better with tacrolimus than with ciclosporin during the first year of liver transplantation. If the patient has a co-morbidity such as active hepatitis B, high doses of hepatitis B immunoglubins are administered in liver transplant patients.

Due to both the pharmacological immunosuppression and the immunosuppression of underlying liver disease, vaccinations against vaccination-preventable diseases are highly recommended before and after liver transplantation. Vaccine hesitancy in transplant recipients is less than in the general population. Vaccinations are preferably administered to the recipient before the transplant, as post-transplant immunosuppression leads to reduced vaccine effectiveness.
Liver transplantation is unique in that the risk of chronic rejection also decreases over time, although the great majority of recipients need to take immunosuppressive medication for the rest of their lives. It is possible to be slowly taken off anti rejection medication but only in certain cases. It is theorized that the liver may play a yet-unknown role in the maturation of certain cells pertaining to the immune system. There is at least one study by Thomas E. Starzl&#x27;s team at the University of Pittsburgh which consisted of bone marrow biopsies taken from such patients which demonstrate genotypic chimerism in the bone marrow of liver transplant recipients.

== Recovery and outcomes ==
The prognosis following liver transplant is variable, depending on overall health, technical success of the surgery, and the underlying disease process affecting the liver. There is no exact model to predict survival rates; those with transplant have a 58% chance of surviving 15 years. Failure of the new liver (primary nonfunction in liver transplantation or PNF) occurs in 10% to 15% of all cases. These percentages are contributed to by many complications. Early graft failure is probably due to preexisting disease of the donated organ. Others include technical flaws during surgery such as revascularization that may lead to a nonfunctioning graft.

== History ==
As with many experimental models used in early surgical research, the first attempts at liver transplantation were performed on dogs. The earliest published reports of canine liver transplantations were performed in 1954 by Vittorio Staudacher at Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan, Italy. This initial attempt varied significantly from contemporary techniques; for example, Staudacher reported &quot;arterialization&quot; of the donor portal vein via the recipient hepatic artery, and use of cholecystostomy for biliary drainage.

The first attempted human liver transplant was performed in 1963 by Thomas Starzl, although the pediatric patient died intraoperatively due to uncontrolled bleeding. Multiple subsequent attempts by various surgeons remained unsuccessful until 1967, when Starzl transplanted a 19-month-old girl with hepatoblastoma who was able to survive for over one year before dying of metastatic disease. Despite the development of viable surgical techniques, liver transplantation remained experimental through the 1970s, with one year patient survival in the vicinity of 25%. The introduction of ciclosporin by Sir Roy Calne, Professor of Surgery Cambridge, markedly improved patient outcomes, and the 1980s saw recognition of liver transplantation as a standard clinical treatment for both adult and pediatric patients with appropriate indications. Liver transplantation is now performed at over one hundred centers in the US, as well as numerous centres in Europe and elsewhere.

The limited supply of liver allografts from non-living donors relative to the number of potential recipients spurred the development of living donor liver transplantation. The first altruistic living liver donation in Britain was performed in December 2012 in St James University Hospital Leeds.

== Research directions ==

=== Cooling ===

There is increasing interest in improving methods for allograft preservation following organ harvesting. The standard &quot;static cold storage&quot; technique relies on flushing a liver with a preservation solution and then placing it in static cold storage at a decreased temperature (usually 4 degrees Celsius) to slow down anaerobic metabolic breakdown. An alternative method involves machine perfusion, in which oxygenated, preservation solutions are continually pumped through the liver prior to transplantation. This is currently being investigated with cold (hypothermic), body temperature (normothermic), and under body temperature (subnormothermic) preservation solutions. Hypothermic machine perfusion has been used successfully at Columbia University and at the University of Zurich. A randomized controlled clinical trial comparing normothermic machine preservation with conventional cold storage showed less donor liver injury, less discarded donor livers (due to suboptimal condition), better early function, and longer preservation times compared with static cold stored livers. Graft survival and patient survival after transplant were similar with both approaches. Machine perfusion prior to transplant is associated with decreased tissue re-perfusion ischemic injury (a process in which liver cells are damaged as a statically stored liver is re-perfused after transplant) as well as a decreased risk of intrahepatic biliary strictures.

A 2014 study showed that the liver preservation time could be significantly extended using a supercooling technique, which preserves the liver at subzero temperatures (-6 °C)

=== Normothermic Regional Perfusion ===
Donation after circulatory death (DCD) has become an increasingly important source of organs for transplantation, with categories ranging from uncontrolled to controlled DCD () donors. Despite its growing use, DCD organs generally suffer from warm ischemia injuries, leading to fewer and lower-quality organs compared to those from donation after brain death (DBD). To mitigate these issues, there has been a rising interest in normothermic regional perfusion (NRP), a technique that temporarily restores oxygenated blood flow to organs after death, thereby improving their viability prior to recovery.

NRP works by reversing the detrimental effects of warm ischemia on cellular energy substrates and antioxidants, thereby reconditioning the organs before transplantation. This technique, often facilitated by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) technology, allows for organ assessment and optimization, reducing the risk of graft failure. NRP can be established either abdominally or thoracoabdominally, depending on the intended organs for transplantation, with specific techniques and monitoring protocols in place to ensure optimal outcomes.
Clinical outcomes of NRP in DCD organ transplantation have shown promising results, particularly in kidney and liver transplantation, with lower rates of complications and improved graft survival compared to traditional preservation methods. Through the utilization of NRP, Dr. Fondevila et al. at Hospital Universitario La Paz have achieved successful transplantation of livers that have undergone extensive warm ischemic periods of up to 2.5 hours prior to recovery. This has resulted in biliary complication and graft survival rates comparable to those observed in controlled DCD livers that have experienced significantly less warm ischemia.

While ethical considerations remain, especially regarding the use of NRP in controlled DCD scenarios, ongoing research aims to address these concerns and expand the application of NRP to other organ types, ultimately increasing the availability of viable organs for transplantation and improving outcomes for patients with end-stage organ disease

=== Herpesvirus 6 Reactivation ===
A study published in &quot;The Journal of Infectious Diseases&quot; in 2024 investigated the reactivation of inherited chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6 (iciHHV-6B) in a liver transplant recipient and its impact on the graft. The research, conducted by Hannolainen et al., utilized hybrid capture sequencing and various molecular techniques to analyze the viral sequences and host immune response. The findings demonstrated active replication of iciHHV-6B within the graft tissue and significant immune activation, suggesting the pathological impact of viral reactivation on transplant outcomes. The study highlights the importance of monitoring iciHHV-6 reactivation in liver transplant recipients.

== Special populations ==
===Alcohol dependence===

The high incidence of liver transplants given to those with alcoholic cirrhosis has led to a recurring controversy regarding the eligibility of such patients for liver transplant. The controversy stems from the view of alcoholism as a self-inflicted disease and the perception that those with alcohol-induced damage are depriving other patients who could be considered more deserving. It is an important part of the selection process to differentiate transplant candidates who have alcohol use disorder as opposed to those who were susceptible to non-dependent alcohol use. The latter who gain control of alcohol use have a good prognosis following transplantation. Once a diagnosis of alcoholism has been established, however, it is necessary to assess the likelihood of future sobriety.

=== HIV ===
Historically, HIV was considered an absolute contraindication to liver transplantation. This was in part due to concern that the infection would be worsened by the immunosuppressive medication which is required after transplantation.

However, with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), people with HIV have much improved prognosis. HIV controlled with HAART is no longer a contraindication to liver transplantation. Uncontrolled HIV disease (AIDS) remains an absolute contraindication.

=== Medical cannabis ===
Medical criteria for transplant often require &quot;lack of substance abuse&quot;. The changing status of cannabis has resulted in many patients who never abused any substancemerely used oneeither being turned down for transplants, forced to stop a useful medicine suggested by their doctors, or both.

For example, in 2011, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center denied a liver transplant to medical cannabis patient Norman Smith. They removed Mr. Smith from a transplant waiting list for &quot;non-compliance of our substance abuse contract&quot;, despite his own oncologist at Cedars-Sinai having recommended that he use the cannabis for his pain and chemotherapy. Dr. Steven D. Colquhoun, director of the Liver Transplant Program, said that the hospital &quot;must consider issues of substance abuse seriously&quot;, but the transplant center did not seriously consider whether Mr. Smith was &quot;using&quot; cannabis versus &quot;abusing&quot; it. In 2012, Cedars-Sinai denied a liver transplant to a second patient, Toni Trujillo, after her Cedars-Sinai doctors knew and approved of her legal use of medical cannabis. In both cases, the patients acceded to the hospital&#x27;s demand and stopped using cannabis, despite its therapeutic benefits for them, but were both sent back to the bottom of the transplant list. Smith&#x27;s death inspired Americans for Safe Access to lobby for the California Medical Cannabis Organ Transplant Act (AB 258), which was enacted in July 2015 to protect future patients from dying at the hands of medical establishments prejudiced against the legal use of medical cannabis.

<doc id="517884" wikidata="Q11172986" url="?curid=517884" title="List of Alias characters">
<text>The following is a partial list of characters from the TV series, &quot;Alias&quot;.

==Overview==
===Main characters===

===Recurring characters===
==McKenas Cole==
McKenas Cole was portrayed by Quentin Tarantino. Formerly an operative for SD-6, he defected from the organization, first to work for &quot;The Man&quot;, and later to assume a leading position in The Covenant.

Cole first appears in the season one episodes &quot;The Box&quot; (Parts I and II). He and a group of agents infiltrate the SD-6 office in Los Angeles and take the entire cell hostage with the exception of Sydney and Jack Bristow, who were in the parking garage of the Credit Dauphine building at the time. It is revealed that he is a former SD-6 agent who was tasked by Arvin Sloane to destroy a pipeline in Chechnya five years prior, but was captured and tortured by rebels. He is ultimately released and becomes an agent for the crime syndicate operated by &quot;The Man,&quot; later revealed to be Irina Derevko, and he tries to procure a vial of liquid from the vault of SD-6 in order to expose the ink of a document written by Milo Rambaldi. However, after valiant efforts by the Bristows and CIA agent Michael Vaughn, he is apprehended and taken into custody by the United States government.

He next appears in the season three episode &quot;After Six.&quot; After Julian Sark and Lauren Reed kill the six leaders of the Covenant cells, they attempt to use this as leverage in order to ascend to more powerful positions within the terrorist organization. To the chagrin of Sark, Lauren went behind his back and alerted Cole of Sark&#x27;s intentions. However, this was of value to Cole and the Covenant, because the CIA was currently looking for a document called The Doleac Agenda that specifies the most important information about the Covenant&#x27;s operations, including the cell leaders&#x27; names. Thus Sark&#x27;s actions, while a betrayal, were beneficial to the Covenant and Cole promoted Sark and Lauren as co-commanders of the North American cell of the Covenant.

Cole also oversaw a demonstration of Sydney&#x27;s apparent brainwashing as Julia Thorne.

Cole&#x27;s current whereabouts and how he escaped from CIA custody are unknown.

==Gordon Dean==
Gordon Dean was portrayed by Tyrees Allen.

Dean was the head of The Shed, a clandestine criminal organization similar to SD-6. As at SD-6, most of the operatives of the Shed believed they were working for a black ops division of the Central Intelligence Agency. Apparently only Dean and his associate Kelly Peyton knew the truth, that the Shed was actually a division of Prophet Five.

Dean initially appeared in the first episode of season 5, claiming to be with the CIA&#x27;s Office of Special Investigations. He claimed to be investigating Michael Vaughn as a double agent, however, APO quickly determined Dean was a rogue agent. He had faked his death two years earlier and had since then been living &quot;off the grid.&quot;

When Shed operative Rachel Gibson learned the Shed&#x27;s actual affiliation, she turned on it and at the behest of APO and Sydney stole the data from the Shed&#x27;s servers. When Dean discovered what she was doing he destroyed the Shed, killing everyone except Peyton and Gibson.

Following the destruction of the Shed, Dean and Peyton undertook a series of attempts to recover or kill Gibson, with no success. Dean was instrumental in securing the release of Arvin Sloane from federal custody and getting Sloane&#x27;s security clearance reinstated so Sloane could work for Dean inside APO. He had an undetermined connection to Sloane prior to this.

Eventually Dean was captured by Gibson and taken into APO custody. While in custody Sloane murdered him at the behest of Peyton who, with Dean&#x27;s death, took control of his operations.

==Elena Derevko==
Elena Derevko was played by Sônia Braga.

Elena is the sister of Irina and Katya Derevko and was one of the KGB&#x27;s foremost assassins, responsible for the murder of countless diplomats and politicians throughout Eastern Europe. She was described by her sister Irina as &quot;volatile and quick-tempered&quot;. Considered the most ruthless of the Derevko sisters, Elena is the secret leader of The Covenant. She was first mentioned in the season three episode &quot;Crossings&quot; by Jack. She is not referenced again until the fourth season, when in &quot;Welcome to Liberty Village&quot; it is revealed that an unidentified Russian group is trying to find her.

Thirty years before Season 4, Elena disappeared and could not be found, even by Irina and around a year before Season 4, Arvin Sloane and Jack Bristow had been investigating Elena&#x27;s whereabouts until Jack received a message from an old associate that led him to one of Elena&#x27;s safehouses in Warsaw. Inside was detailed information on the lives of Sydney Bristow and Nadia Santos, her nieces, with evidence suggesting she had them under surveillance for at least a decade.

Soon Nadia&#x27;s former caretaker Sophia Vargas arrived in Los Angeles claiming that her reason for coming to the United States was due to an attack by an unidentified group at her home in Lisbon, Portugal. They quickly assumed Elena was the responsible behind the attack, not realising that she was in fact &quot;Sophia&quot;.

Under the alias of &quot;Sophia Vargas&quot;, Elena used her former connection to Nadia to stay with her and Sydney to monitor their work for the CIA. She also monitored Nadia&#x27;s conversations through a necklace equipped with a microphone.

She later hacked into Nadia&#x27;s laptop and requested to move the Hydrosek, a deadly weapon, to an unsecured location away from APO. Elena and her associate Avian then stole the weapon before Nadia and Weiss could stop them, not realizing who the thief was.

In order to complete her endgame, Elena, fully aware of the fact that he would at some point double-cross her, also ordered the creation of &quot;Arvin Clone&quot;, a corporal in the U.S. Army named Ned Bolger, who was captured and brainwashed to believe that he was, in fact Arvin Sloane, committing numerous criminal acts in the process, such as setting Irina up to appear as if she had contracted an assassin to kill Sydney.

Elena sent a team into the Department of Special Research to steal all the Rambaldi artifacts necessary to complete &quot;Rambaldi&#x27;s endgame&quot;. On the same night, she left Sydney and Nadia&#x27;s house, saying that she had been informed by the Lisbon police that it was safe for her to return. Hours later, Hayden Chase entered the house and accused Nadia of working against the government and allowing the team to break into the DSR. It was at this point that Jack and Sloane began to realize that Sophia was Elena, which was backed by the microphone found in the necklace given to Nadia by Sophia.

Sloane deduced that Elena would go to Lazlo Drake with the Rambaldi artifacts. Sydney and Sloane went to meet him, but he was already dead. Sydney found a hidden camera and rewound the feed to see Elena talking with Drake. Before she could see where they planned to take the Rambaldi artifacts, Sloane tranquillized her and left. He met up with Elena in her office in Prague and offered his services to help complete her task. Jack discovered through Katya Derevko that The Covenant was a major terrorist organization set up by Elena in order to secretly acquire Rambaldi artifacts.

Dixon, Nadia and Sydney were sent on a mission to stop them. Dixon found Elena and Sloane, but Elena shot him before he could react. While in the hospital, Dixon told Sydney that he saw Irina Derevko before Elena shot him. It was discovered that Elena had used Project Helix to create a double of Irina, then through the use of &quot;Arvin Clone&quot; set up a hit on Sydney, sparking the events that led to the double&#x27;s execution - to ultimately lead the intelligence/criminal world to believe that she was dead. The double was described as being an ardent follower of Elena Derevko, and fully aware of the fact that she was being set up to die.

The real Irina, however, was imprisoned by Elena, and tortured for her knowledge of a Rambaldi prophecy known as &quot;Il Diluvio&quot;, the Flood. She was kept for eighteenth months in Prague, but moved to a remote location in Guatemala - Tikal. Sydney, Jack and Nadia located her through Lucian Nisard, and saved her from Elena&#x27;s guards.

Elena and Sloane constructed a massive Mueller device over the Russian city of Sovogda which, in conjunction with the tainted water supply from The Orchid, infected the people of Sovogda and made them extremely aggressive. When Sloane learned that APO had sent a team into the city to stop them, he offered to head out with the team himself. While he was doing this, Elena began to transmit a subaudible frequency via the Russian mil-sat network to spread the infection worldwide. The second that the bombers were scheduled to destroy Sovogda, the frequency would be broadcast causing the effects of Sovogda to occur worldwide.

One of Elena&#x27;s men found Nadia walking around the streets and brought her to Elena, who told Nadia that she never wanted to hurt her. She said that she always thought of Nadia as her daughter, then offered her a place alongside her. She showed Nadia a map of the world with pinpoints all over it, saying &quot;the flood has begun, just a few will survive.&quot; Nadia refused to join her, saying that she would never kill Sydney as Rambaldi&#x27;s prophecy had stated. Elena then injected Nadia with the tainted water, which infected her with the aim of forcing her to kill Sydney.

Elena noticed Sloane on the monitor. He was back and carrying a supposedly unconscious Vaughn, but as soon as they arrived in the base they began to shoot Elena&#x27;s men. They were joined by Jack and Irina. They got to Elena and Irina knocked her to the floor with her gun. Sloane put Elena in a chair and Jack and Vaughn went to the computers to stop the mil-sat network from uploading the frequency. However, they could not retract the transmission. Elena told them that she had planned the attack for five years; it would not be that simple to stop her. Sydney managed to get into the main circuit board, but found a blue and a white wire. Irina did not know which to cut, and she asked Elena. When she refused to answer, she told Jack to start torturing her. Before he could do so, Elena told him to stop, and said to cut the white wire. Irina immediately shot Elena on the head and told Sydney to cut the blue wire.

===Elena&#x27;s Past with Nadia===
Sydney and Vaughn discover footage of a very young Nadia being tested with Rambaldi fluid in a Russian bunker. Katya Derevko tells them Nadia was born to Irina in a Soviet prison after Irina left Jack. Sydney was born in 1975 and Irina left in late 1981. This means Nadia has to have been born in 1982. The footage proves Nadia was in Soviet custody for at least the first few years of her life. Conservatively, based on the footage, she could have been in Soviet hands until at least 1985.

Elena, as Sophia Vargas, tells Michael Vaughn the only time she met his father Bill was when he left Nadia in her care at the orphanage in Buenos Aires. However, Michael Vaughn locates Sophia&#x27;s address in Lisbon through an encoded entry in a journal purported to have belonged to his father, which indicated Bill Vaughn had survived past 1979, when Irina Derevko was supposed to have killed him. Since this journal was revealed a forgery, there is no reason to believe information given by Elena supporting the authenticity of the journal was true.

Nadia ran away from the orphanage in 1992. The footage is fairly dark but it is possible she was as young as 10 when she ran away. She&#x27;s in a dormitory with other girls of about that age. She&#x27;s recruited by Roberto Fox when she&#x27;s 17 or 18, which would make the year 1999 or 2000. She dies in circa 2007.

In this timeline, the only loose ends are how Nadia ended up at the orphanage in the first place and why the mercenary Roberts would tell Michael Vaughn his father was involved. Since the orphanage was headed up by Elena Derevko, the most obvious explanation is that Elena kidnapped her after she was taken from Irina and she simply lied to Vaughn about his father&#x27;s involvement, and Roberts was paid to do the same.

==Katya Derevko==
Yekaterina &quot;Katya&quot; Derevko, alias the Black Sparrow, was the second of the three Derevko sisters to be introduced. She was played by Isabella Rossellini.

Katya first appeared during the third season, sent by Irina in response to Jack&#x27;s request for help in extricating Sydney and Vaughn from a North Korean prison. Following the mission, Katya kisses Jack passionately.

In the course of searching for The Passenger after her abduction in season 3, Sydney and Vaughn discover video files of Nadia as a small child in an abandoned Russian military bunker, formerly the center of Soviet Rambaldi research. Katya and several Russian guards confront them, but Katya turns on the guards, subduing them with tranquilizer darts, and the three of them travel to St. Petersburg. Katya fills them in on Nadia&#x27;s background, claiming that Nadia was born to Irina in a Russian prison after Irina left Jack. Since Sydney was born in April 1975 and Irina left Jack in late 1981, Nadia must have been born in 1982. This timeline is irreconcilable with reports that Vaughn&#x27;s father had rescued Nadia as a young girl, since he was killed by Irina in 1979, confirming the belief that Elena Derevko had fabricated the story of Bill Vaughn&#x27;s involvement. Katya and Jack work together to trace Sloane&#x27;s movements through bank activity, and Katya flirts outrageously with Jack. Jack initially rebuffs her advances but later kisses her deeply.

After Nadia&#x27;s rescue, Vaughn tracks down his wife, Lauren Reed. He has captured her, beaten her, and is about to kill her when Katya intervenes, stabbing Vaughn in the back and releasing Lauren. While engaged in reconnaissance of a Covenant operation in Palermo, Sydney encounters Katya again. Katya attempts to shoot her (thereby confirming to Sydney that Katya is allied with the Covenant), but Sydney had removed the bullets from Katya&#x27;s gun. Sydney hits Katya with a tranquilizer dart and Katya is taken into federal custody.

Nothing is seen of Katya until Nadia visits her in prison in season 4, seeking to learn more about the mother Nadia never knew. Katya eats some chocolate Nadia brought her, triggering a near-fatal allergic reaction to illustrate her desperation to meet with Sydney. Sydney visits Katya in the prison infirmary to warn her against continuing to see Nadia. Katya tells her that she never intended to harm Sydney in Palermo, and Irina never intended to harm Sydney either. Irina had tried to contact Katya, concerned someone was setting her up. Katya asks Sydney to retrieve the message from Irina, which is contained in a music box. Sydney retrieves the box and recovers the message, which leads her to bank records in the name of Arvin. Sydney informs Katya that the records exonerate Irina and implicate Sloane (it was later discovered that Sloane&#x27;s imposter, a pawn of Elena Derevko, was behind it).

After Elena&#x27;s raid on the Department of Special Research and with Katya being the only Derevko he has access to, Jack visits her in prison seeking information on the whereabouts and operations of Elena. In exchange, he promises to do everything in his power to secure her release. Katya tells him Elena was the true power behind the Covenant and advises him that Elena&#x27;s base of operations is in Prague, but only Irina knew Elena&#x27;s full endgame and how to stop it.

Whether Jack was successful in securing Katya&#x27;s release is unknown, and no further information regarding her current status is extant.

==Anna Espinosa==
Anna Espinosa was initially played by Gina Torres. Born in Cuba but raised in Russia, Anna was a Soviet spy at some point, until the collapse of the Soviet Union. She is a devout follower of Rambaldi, as evidenced by the eye tattoo on her hand, and as such is one of the many characters obsessed with carrying on the late prophet&#x27;s work, though her appearances on the show are scant compared to the other zealots.

In season one, Espinosa is a ruthless and persistent nemesis to Sydney while the latter goes on missions for SD-6. She worked for K-Directorate, a rival organization of SD-6, composed of former operatives from the Eastern bloc, and was the go-to officer for Wetworks and Active Measures, until The Man, aka Irina Derevko, took down the organization and seized control of its assets. Upon the fall of the organization, Anna staged her death and went freelance, selling her skills as an agent to the highest bidder.

She is not seen again until the fourth season, under the employ of the Cadmus Revolutionary Front (an organization believed to be composed of former Covenant operatives until it is revealed the organization is still alive under Elena Derevko). She is tasked to steal a chemical bomb but instead eliminates CRF&#x27;s leader upon retrieving it. She rescues Julian Sark and plans to sell the bomb, but Sark betrays her and she is captured by Sydney. She is thereupon taken into federal custody.

She returned for the 100th episode of the series, entitled &quot;There&#x27;s Only One Sydney Bristow&quot;. Prophet Five, using its government contacts, was able to secure her release. She then kidnaps Will in an attempt to blackmail Sydney. She is able to obtain Page 47 of the Rambaldi prophecy, depicting the Chosen One, a woman bearing Sydney&#x27;s likeness. At the end of the episode, possibly using Project Helix, the controlling elements of Prophet Five genetically transformed Espinosa into Sydney&#x27;s double after the latter&#x27;s DNA was sampled by Prophet Five. At this point Jennifer Garner took over the portrayal of the character.

The first encounter APO personnel had with the transformed Anna occurred in Ghana in the episode &quot;30 Seconds&quot; and resulted in her killing freelance operative Renée Rienne before escaping. In the following episode (&quot;I See Dead People&quot;), Anna is ordered to intercept the real Sydney, who is &quot;en route&quot; to contact Michael Vaughn. Anna tries to deceive Vaughn, but he realizes she is an imposter, though he does not know her true identity. They fight, but as Anna gains the upper hand, she is shot in the back and head by Sydney, who had just arrived at the scene. Sydney subsequently impersonates Anna within Prophet Five for a brief time, initially convincing Sloane she (Anna) had killed Sydney by shooting her in the back. Sloane conspired to kill Anna as he felt Sydney did not deserve to die that way, but subsequently realized Sydney was impersonating her, first by doubts as Sloane notices the passion behind how Sydney (impersonating Anna) talks to him and later confirmed when Sydney told Sloane &quot;I don&#x27;t die that easy&quot; inside a prison cell after Sydney meets with The Rose. Apparently, Prophet Five considered Anna either disposable or too dangerous to their plans to keep alive, as they planned to kill her once she fulfilled her duties foreseen by Rambaldi as the Chosen One (namely retrieving an artifact from San Cielo).

==Thomas Grace==

Thomas Grace was portrayed by Balthazar Getty.

The character was introduced in the second episode of the fifth season. Thomas Grace is recruited into Authorized Personnel Only, a black-ops division of the CIA, in order to replace agent Michael Vaughn after Vaughn is supposedly killed (he also replaces Eric Weiss after Weiss transfers out of APO). This led to friction between Grace and Vaughn&#x27;s partner and fiancée, Sydney. Grace also bonded with another new APO recruit, Rachel Gibson, and began training the novice agent to fight.

Not much is known about the character&#x27;s background, although his file, details unknown, caused many a person to halt and reconsider welcoming him into APO with open arms. In &quot;The Horizon&quot;, Marshall Flinkman discovers that Grace used to be married, though he initially believes it is a remnant from an undercover assignment. Grace reacts with anger at Marshall&#x27;s nosiness.

In &quot;S.O.S&quot;, Grace takes part in an APO mission to infiltrate CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia in order to locate Sydney, who has been kidnapped by Prophet Five. During the mission, he takes advantage of the opportunity to obtain information from the Witness Protection Program regarding the man who, it is revealed, murdered Grace&#x27;s wife Amanda. Later, Grace tracks the man down, but instead of killing him, asks to be put in touch with someone called &quot;The Cardinal.&quot; His &quot;off-book&quot; mission does not go unnoticed, as Rachel discovers Grace&#x27;s investigation. Grace, in response, lies to her and says he intended to kill the man, but was unable to do so once he saw that he had started a family of his own.

In &quot;No Hard Feelings&quot;, Rachel discovers the truth: The Cardinal is the man who ordered the death of Grace&#x27;s wife and the man he had pursued was the hit man assigned to do the job. The hit man agrees to tell Grace why his wife was targeted, in return for his vehicle which had been impounded by the government. Upon returning the vehicle to the hit man, he is told that Amanda was simply &quot;in the wrong place at the wrong time&quot; and that the intent was actually to kill Grace. The hit man then drives off in his vehicle, only to die when Grace detonates a bomb inside. The identity of &quot;The Cardinal&quot; and why he had targeted Grace for assassination is never revealed.

In the penultimate episode of Alias, Grace is sent to defuse a bomb that Sark had placed onto a subway to destroy APO headquarters. Unable to defuse the bomb, he repeatedly sprays liquid nitrogen on it, which slows down the mechanism for a short period of time but does not disable it. He is instructed to leave when the timer gets to 60 seconds, but ultimately stays with the bomb beyond the one-minute threshold in order to keep it from going off. His last words are to Rachel Gibson, telling her that he wished they had more time because he would have asked her out. Starting to cry, Rachel responds that she would have said yes just as the bomb detonates, killing Grace.

==Assistant Director Kendall==

Assistant Director Kendall was played by Terry O&#x27;Quinn.

He first appeared in the first season as the head of an FBI tribunal brought in from Washington DC to interrogate Sydney after she is arrested following evidence linking her to a prophecy by 15th century prophet Milo Rambaldi which suggests she could be a national security risk to the United States. Kendall questions her on every aspect of her life, until she is broken out of FBI custody.

Kendall then reappeared in the second episode of season two, assuming command of a joint FBI/CIA task force working to bring down criminal organization the Alliance and primarily, their SD-6 cell, though his reappearance coincided specifically with the surrender of Irina Derevko to the CIA. He immediately became a source of antagonism for the characters with his no-nonsense, by the book approach. The character effectively became a second season regular, appearing in almost every episode, although almost nothing was learned about him (to this day his first name remains a mystery) and he was mainly a source of exposition.

Following the two year time jump between the end of season two and beginning of the third season, Kendall was replaced as head of the task force by Marcus Dixon, though later reappeared again midway through the season when he met secretly with Sydney and informed her of the truth: he was never an FBI Assistant Director as he claimed, and had in fact always been affiliated with the Department of Special Research (DSR). He ran their facility in Nevada, Project Black Hole, which held everything the US government had collected on Rambaldi. He informs Sydney about what happened during the two years she was missing, and how they overcame their past differences and formed a friendship. The episode is Kendall&#x27;s last appearance in the series.

==Alexander Khasinau==

Alexander Khasinau was played by Derrick O&#x27;Connor.

Alexander Khasinau is second-in-command of a criminal organization headed by a mysterious figure known as &quot;The Man.&quot; Julian Sark, who undertakes a number of missions on behalf of this organization, reports to Khasinau, leading SD-6 to believe that Khasinau is &quot;The Man.&quot; Khasinau owns a nightclub in Paris which serves as a front for his criminal activities.

Following a raid on SD-6 headquarters, led by McKenas Cole, who says his employer is &quot;The Man&quot;, Arvin Sloane seeks a declaration of war by the Alliance of Twelve on Khasinau. In an attempt to secure the swing vote of SD-9 leader Edward Poole, Sloane assassinates fellow SD cell leader Jean Briault at his behest, after Poole shows Sloane evidence of Briault&#x27;s complicity with Khasinau. When Poole still votes against war, Sloane realizes that Poole framed Briault and manipulated him into the assassination. Poole is the one actually in league with Khasinau.

Sloane tells Sydney that following the disappearance of Sydney&#x27;s mother, Irina Derevko, Sloane served on a commission that investigated her activities. He states that Khasinau had been Irina&#x27;s superior at the KGB. In a later episode, videotape footage of Irina shows her stating that Khasinau actually recruited her.

Khasinau, through his mole in the CIA, FBI agent Steven Haladki, learns that Sydney Bristow is a double agent for the CIA. He uses this knowledge to formulate a plan to expose SD-6 by feeding information to Sydney&#x27;s reporter friend Will Tippin. When Tippin, at the urging of Jack, mentions &quot;The Circumference,&quot; Khasinau has Tippin come to Paris and has him interrogated under sodium pentathol. Tippin is rescued by Sydney, who is in Paris with Marcus Dixon to retrieve a Rambaldi document from Khasinau&#x27;s office.

Khasinau arranges for Tippin to be kidnapped by Sark from a CIA safehouse, transported to Taipei and tortured by an evil dentist for more information about the Circumference. Tippin knows nothing about it other than the name. Ironically, it turns out that Khasinau already had the Circumference and didn&#x27;t realize it. It is the Rambaldi document that SD-6 had previously retrieved from his office. Jack trades the Circumference to Sark to secure Tippin&#x27;s release.

In the season 1 finale, Khasinau reveals to Sydney that he is not &quot;The Man.&quot; &quot;The Man&quot; is in fact Sydney&#x27;s mother, Irina. It is unclear how widespread the knowledge that Khasinau is not the leader is within the organization. Khasinau is apparently able to inspire fanatical devotion among some members of the organization. Haladki, once exposed by Jack as a double agent, entreats Jack to join with Khasinau, saying Khasinau is &quot;the future.&quot;

Khasinau is killed by Irina early in Season 2 in the course of a mission to retrieve &quot;the Bible,&quot; a book containing the protocols of Irina&#x27;s criminal organization.

==Andrian Lazarey==

Andrian Lazarey was played by Mark Bramhall.

Andrian Lazarey was a Russian diplomat. He was the father of Julian Sark, a descendant of the Romanovs and a member of the Magnific Order of Rambaldi. He was first seen in a videotape in the season 3 premiere episode, the apparent victim of an assassination by Sydney. Sydney had been missing for almost two years, and the only record she had of that time was the tape.

With Lazarey&#x27;s apparent death, his fortune of $800,000,000 in gold bullion passed to Sark. Sark was in CIA custody, and a shadowy organization known as The Covenant sprang him in exchange for seizing that fortune. Lauren Reed, an agent of the National Security Council and the wife of Michael Vaughn, was assigned to learn the identity of Lazarey&#x27;s murderer.

As Sydney continued to search for clues to her missing two years, she deciphered a coded message that had been left in a penthouse in Rome, Italy. The message was a set of coordinates which led her and Jack to a box buried in the California desert. The box contained a severed hand marked with the Eye of Rambaldi. Tests determined that it belonged to Lazarey and the time since it was severed proved that Sydney did not kill Lazarey.

In an attempt to recover her memories, Sydney submitted herself to a chemical procedure and received a number of cryptic visions. One repeating image was the name &quot;St. Aidan&quot; and the image of her friend Will Tippin, who was currently in the Witness Protection Program. (&quot;Conscious&quot;)

Sydney contacted Will and learned that St. Aiden was the name of one of the contacts he&#x27;d cultivated during his time as a CIA analyst. Will contacted St. Aidan, who turned out to be Lazarey. Lazarey gave him information that led them to a Rambaldi artifact, a sample of Rambaldi&#x27;s DNA. Lazarey was captured by the Covenant during that meeting and tortured by Sark for the information he had given Will and Sydney. (&quot;Remnants&quot;)

FBI Assistant Director Kendall finally filled Sydney in on her lost time. She had been captured by The Covenant and conditioned to be an assassin operating under the name Julia Thorne. Because of her Project Christmas conditioning, the Covenant was unsuccessful. Sydney operated within The Covenant as a double agent. She was tasked to find out from Lazarey the location of the Rambaldi cube containing the DNA sample and then kill him. Instead, Sydney and Lazarey faked his death and searched for the cube under the auspices of the CIA.

Together they located the cube in the Fish River Gorge in Namibia. They recovered the cube from the vault in which it was housed but Lazarey became trapped, necessitating the severing of his hand by Sydney to free him. Per Lazarey&#x27;s agreement with the CIA, he vanished.

Sydney learned that the Covenant planned to combine the Rambaldi DNA sample with her eggs to create the &quot;second coming&quot; of Rambaldi. Horrified, she hid the DNA sample and had her memory wiped so that the Covenant could not use her to locate it.

The CIA undertook a mission to recover the genetic material, although Sydney decided to destroy it instead. The CIA team recovered Lazarey from Covenant custody. He was transported to a hospital and while in transit asked Sydney if she knew about &quot;The Passenger.&quot; Before Lazarey could reveal any additional information about The Passenger, he was assassinated by Lauren, a double agent for the Covenant. (&quot;Full Disclosure&quot;)

==Dr. Zhang Lee==

Dr. Zhang Lee was played by Ric Young.

Lee is a torturer, always remaining eerily calm and distant from the pain he inflicts. He was always seen wearing a suit and glasses, which led to his being referred to by the nickname &quot;Suit &#x27;N&#x27; Glasses&quot; before his name was finally revealed in the third season.

Lee first appeared in the pilot episode, &quot;Truth Be Told&quot;. He tortured Sydney by extracting a molar, trying to find out who her employer was. Sydney was eventually able to escape after stabbing him with his own equipment. He returned in the first-season finale, &quot;Almost Thirty Years&quot;, this time to find out what Will Tippin knew about a Rambaldi artifact known as The Circumference. Lee used a truth serum that was known to cause paralysis in 1 in 5 recipients, after which he determined that Tippin knew nothing and could be released. Tippin subsequently turned the serum on Lee, screaming, &quot;One in five, you little bitch!&quot;. While Tippin was not paralyzed as a result of receiving the serum, Lee was not so fortunate.

He resurfaced in the season two episode &quot;A Higher Echelon&quot;, now in an electric wheelchair. His new victim was Marshall Flinkman, who he threatened with an epoxy that would expand, harden, and puncture his organs when ingested. Marshall seemed to cave under the threat and agreed to reconstruct a computer program for him. However, this was simply to buy time for Sydney to rescue him and Lee was left empty-handed again, though this time he got away with only being kicked out of his chair.

In the third-season episode &quot;Legacy&quot;, Lee was discovered to have been in charge of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Rambaldi research in the early 1980s, including overseeing experiments on Sydney&#x27;s sister Nadia Santos. Whether he was a follower of Milo Rambaldi or he was simply following orders is unknown. Sydney and Michael Vaughn tracked him down and captured him. Now in a position of no power at all, his calm demeanor evaporated and he became a terrified, sobbing wreck. When he was unable to give any pertinent information, Vaughn poured a powerfully corrosive liquid over his unfeeling legs and then the rest of his body. Lee made no further appearances so his final fate is unknown.

==Milo Rambaldi==
Milo Giacomo Rambaldi is a historical personage. The work of Rambaldi, often centuries ahead of its time and tied to prophecy, plays a central role in the show.

According to &quot;Alias&quot; creator J. J. Abrams, in a feature on Rambaldi included on the season 5 DVD box set, the Mueller device and Milo Rambaldi were originally intended simply to be MacGuffins.

Rambaldi&#x27;s technological developments are sought after by numerous governments and rogue organizations in the series. Arvin Sloane is generally obsessed with obtaining Rambaldi&#x27;s work and unlocking its secrets.

There seems to be no limit to Rambaldi&#x27;s genius; he was highly adept in automatism, life extension, protein engineering, mathematics, cryptography and cartography. Rambaldi is said to have predicted the digital Information Age. He invented a machine code language around 1489, cryptographic algorithms, and sketched the designs of a portable vocal communicator and a prototype that reflected the properties of a transistor.

The character draws its inspiration from real-life historical figures including Leonardo da Vinci and Nostradamus. Rambaldi&#x27;s artistic-looking manuscripts, written in code, are a direct reference to Leonardo&#x27;s method of recording his work.

The Rambaldi subplot, which dominated the first two seasons of the series and was greatly explored in the second half of the third season, was virtually nonexistent in the early episodes of season four. However, it continued to lurk in the background of the series and, as series creator J. J. Abrams promised, resurfaced in full later in the season. Rambaldi and his works continued to figure heavily through the end of the series, forming a major plot point of the finale.

===Fictional biography===
Rambaldi (1444–1496), an artist, alchemist, engineer, mystic, and renaissance man in the vein of Da Vinci, served as chief architect to Pope Alexander Sextus.

Rambaldi was born in Parma, educated by Vespertine monks, and worked as a student of the arts until he was 12. During his travels to Rome when he was 18, he met Cardinal Rodericus of Borgia (Borja) and was later retained privately as an architect, consultant and prophet when Rodericus became Pope in 1492.

His writings and plans are written in multiple languages ranging from Italian and Demotic hybrids to elusive mixtures of symbols (pre-masonic cipher encryptions). Rambaldi also created the earliest known watermark which he used on all of his documents: a naked eye, visible only when viewed under black light, known as &quot;the eye of Rambaldi&quot;, which helped distinguish original works from forgeries many years later. His waterpapers were all handmade from a unique polymer fiber.

Despite Borgia&#x27;s benevolence, Rambaldi and his works never became famous due to Archdeacon Claudio Vespertini, who feared the revolutionary implications of the technologies defined in Rambaldi&#x27;s belief system: Rambaldi believed that science would someday allow us to know God. Vespertini attempted to pursue and destroy everything he could find and keep the name of Rambaldi &quot;invisible&quot;.

When Alexander VI died in 1503, Vespertini ordered that the name &quot;Rambaldi&quot; be erased from all inscriptions between 1470 and 1496 and his workshop in Rome destroyed. Rambaldi himself was excommunicated for heresy and sentenced to death by flame. However, Rambaldi died in the winter of 1496, a lonely man without a known surviving heir.

Not long after his death, a second workshop was discovered in San Lazzaro and was destroyed by the Vatican. Plans and sketches were sold and traded as if without value during a private auction. These plans were later located, starting in the 15th century and continuing to recent years, around Italy, France, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Plans were also found in private collections and museum warehouses. During the Third Reich, documents interpreting his designs and teachings were highly sought-after. It was during this time that the nickname &quot;Nostravinci&quot; arose among auctioneering circles. The design directive for many of these drawings remains unclear to this day and has inspired some impressive forgeries, even prime examples of digital piracy. However &quot;the eye of Rambaldi&quot; was proven to be the only accurate method to identify genuine artifacts.

===Known Rambaldi artifacts===
* Mueller device - Designed by Rambaldi and built by Oskar Mueller. Known effects include increasing the aggression of certain bees and emitting a sub-sonic frequency which combined with chemical contaminants causes heightened aggression in humans. Five Mueller devices are known to have been built. One small-scale device was seized by Sydney and handed over to Sloane. Its status is unknown as the CIA found no Rambaldi artifacts when it raided SD-6. One large-scale device was destroyed by Sydney in Taipei. &quot;Arvin Clone&quot; had completed one small-scale device, the status of which is unknown, and one large-scale device located in his Santiago compound, which was seized and/or destroyed by APO. There were also incomplete components of at least one more device in the compound, also presumably seized and/or destroyed by APO. Finally, Elena Derevko constructed an enormous Mueller device in Sovogda, Russia, which Sydney destroyed.
* Notebook - Recovered from San Lazzaro. Not seen on-screen; an analysis by SD-6 indicates that the notebook contains rudimentary schematics for a cellular phone.
* Sketches - Two sketches, each of which contains half of a binary code. The second sketch is destroyed by acid in Berlin. When the codes are combined with a compression scheme, they reveal the location of the &quot;Sol D&#x27;Oro&quot;.
* &quot;Sol D&#x27;Oro&quot; (Golden Sun) - A yellow disk constructed of synthetic polymers, made to resemble stained glass.
* Clock - Commissioned and designed by Rambaldi and built by Giovanni Donato (the only man Rambaldi ever collaborated with). When combined with the Golden Sun disk, the clock reveals a star chart identifying the location of Rambaldi&#x27;s journal.
* Rambaldi&#x27;s journal - Contains instructions on how to assemble Rambaldi&#x27;s designs. Page 47 was written in invisible ink and became known as &quot;The Prophecy&quot; since when decoded revealed a text and a drawing identifying Sydney as the &quot;Chosen One&quot;. Page 94 included a listing of &quot;apocalyptic dates and times&quot;.
* Ampule - Filled with a &quot;Rambaldi liquid&quot; used to make the text of Page 47 and the Circumference visible.
* Code key - Inscribed on the frame of a portrait of Pope Alexander VI painted by Rambaldi, housed in The Vatican. Used to decode page 47 of Rambaldi&#x27;s journal.
* The Circumference - A page of text describing the construction and application of the Mueller device. Like Page 47, it was written in invisible ink. It was obtained from the CIA for Irina Derevko in exchange for Will Tippin. It is next seen in the possession of &quot;Arvin Clone&quot;.
* Music box - Played a sequence that when each note was translated to its corresponding frequency, revealed an equation for zero-point energy. Destroyed by Sydney after recording the equation to prevent it from falling into the hands of SD-6.
* Flower - Found in an egg-shaped container, it was apparently 400–600 years old, Rambaldi&#x27;s proof of eternal life.
* Firebomb - A neutron bomb designed by Rambaldi, it delivered micropulses that disintegrated organic matter but left inorganic matter unharmed.
* Cut-out manuscript page - A manuscript page with a section cut out of the center. Sloane recovers the missing piece from inside a 15th-century statue of an &quot;arhat&quot;.
* &quot;Study of the Human Heart&quot; - Recovered by Jack and Irina. The CIA intended to use this manuscript and Irina to flush Sloane out, but Irina double-crossed Jack, stole the manuscript and turned it over to Sloane in exchange for extracting her from CIA custody. Included the DNA &quot;fingerprint&quot; of Proteo di Regno, which also served as a code key for page 94 of the Rambaldi journal.
* Di Regno heart - Found inside Proteo di Regno&#x27;s body, apparently keeping him alive. Used to power &quot;Il Dire&quot;.
* Pages - loose pages seen in the possession of the man in Nepal who gives Sloane The Restoration.
* &quot;Il Dire&quot; (The Telling) - A machine made of 47 Rambaldi artifacts, it wrote the word &quot;eirene&quot; (&quot;peace&quot; in Greek) along with the DNA sequence of The Passenger.
* Medication - derived from a formula found in Rambaldi&#x27;s journal and used on Allison Doren. It helped her heal from the extensive wounds she received at Sydney&#x27;s hands and may have imparted lasting rapid regenerative abilities. Not seen on-screen.
* Keys - A dozen keys collected by Andrian Lazarey (although one may have been collected by Sydney in the animated episode included on the season 3 DVD set). Used to open the vault which housed the Cube holding Rambaldi&#x27;s DNA.
* Cube - Housed a live sample of Rambaldi&#x27;s DNA. Collected by Sydney and Lazarey and later concealed by Sydney, which prompted her to erase her memory. The Cube would eventually be retrieved by Sydney for the CIA and was then stolen by The Covenant, who planned to fuse the DNA with Sydney&#x27;s eggs to engineer Rambaldi&#x27;s second coming. Destroyed by Sydney.
* Kaleidoscope - This artifact required three discs. Once the discs were inserted into the kaleidoscope, they formed a map of an underwater formation in the Sea of Japan, where four additional discs were found.
* Discs - four discs recovered from the Sea of Japan that were required to open the &quot;Irina&quot; box.
* &quot;Irina&quot; box - A box with the name Irina inscribed on it. It was rumored to contain &quot;the Passenger&quot;, which the CIA believed to be a bioweapon. Supposedly it had not been opened since Rambaldi&#x27;s time but apparently Sloane had found it open, because he hid the di Regno heart inside it.
* The Restoration - A manuscript which references &quot;The Passenger&quot; and the Hourglass. Contains the formula for &quot;Rambaldi fluid&quot;.
* Code key - Used to decode The Restoration. Not seen on-screen. Lauren Reed stole a false code key created by the CIA.
* Hourglass - Contained a fluid that powered the battery for the EEG machine.
* EEG machine - A device that reveals the identity of &quot;The Passenger&quot; by sketching her brainwaves.
* The Passenger - First believed to be a bioweapon, but discovered to be actually a living person with a &quot;direct conduit&quot; to Milo Rambaldi and the only one to know the exact location of the Sphere of Life. The Passenger is revealed to be Nadia Santos, daughter of Arvin Sloane and Irina Derevko and half-sister of Sydney Bristow.
* &quot;Rambaldi fluid&quot; - A chemical containing &quot;protein strains&quot; which, when injected into Nadia Santos (The Passenger), made her a &quot;direct conduit to Rambaldi.&quot; This allowed her to experience visions and through muscle memory transcribe a complex algebraic equation for longitude and latitude, the location of the Sphere of Life.
* The Sphere of Life - A vessel that supposedly houses Rambaldi&#x27;s consciousness and is placed over a floor made of glass that only the Passager can walk. When &quot;the Passenger&quot; came into contact with it, she saw terrifying flashes of the future.
* The Vespertine Papers - Texts, rumored to have been destroyed during World War II, which refer to properties of the Rambaldi orchid. Not seen on-screen. Pages obtained from the Department of Special Research (which may or may not have been genuine Rambaldi pages) were placed in an auction as The Vespertine Papers to flush out &quot;Arvin Clone&quot;.
* Orchid - &quot;Paphiopedilum khan&quot;, a rare lady slipper orchid brought to Italy from China in 1269. Recovered by &quot;Arvin Clone&quot; from the Monte Inferno monastery, it is the source of a chemical contaminant that (when combined with other substances seeded in various water supplies by Sloane) encourages human qualities like empathy and harmonic coexistence; in conjunction with the Mueller device, it causes heightened aggression in humans.
* &quot;Vade Mecum&quot; - A Rambaldi manuscript, translated by Lazlo Drake. Described by Sloane as &quot;a template describing how Rambaldi&#x27;s creations were to be assembled in order to bring forth his final prophecy&quot;. Not shown on-screen.
* &quot;Il Diluvio&quot; (The Flood) - A manuscript that described Rambaldi&#x27;s vision of a moment when the world would be cleansed and everything would begin anew. Not seen on-screen; Irina states that she destroyed it.
* The &quot;Profeta Cinque&quot; (Fifth Prophet) - A manuscript written in apparently unbreakable code that speaks of advanced genetics.
* Horizon - A small orb which, when placed on the stone altar in Rambaldi&#x27;s tomb, forms a levitating sphere which generates a red fluid which has the power to convey immortality.
* Amulet - Recovered from &quot;The Rose&quot;, it is considered Rambaldi&#x27;s greatest gift and also his greatest curse. A defiance to the natural order and the end of nature itself. The Amulet apparently contains a map to Rambaldi&#x27;s tomb, which is revealed by sunlight shining through it while in a cavern on Mt. Subasio.
* Rambaldi&#x27;s Tomb - Contains what appears to be the coffin of Rambaldi and a stone altar, which works in conjunction with &quot;The Horizon&quot;.

=== Symbol ===

The symbol , generally referred to as the &quot;Eye of Rambaldi,&quot; is the symbol of The Magnific Order of Rambaldi. In the episode &quot;Time Will Tell&quot;, a direct descendant of Giovanni Donato (who may, in fact, have been Donato himself) describes the Order as &quot;Rambaldi&#x27;s most trusted followers, entrusted with safeguarding his creations. Sadly, like most things that once were pure, criminals now use this symbol to infiltrate the Order.&quot; Some followers of Rambaldi have the mark tattooed on their hands, including Anna Espinosa.

The glyph is also said by Irina Derevko to represent the struggle between &quot;The Chosen One&quot; and &quot;The Passenger&quot;, whom Irina believes to be her two daughters. (See Rambaldi&#x27;s prophecies below.) The circle in the center of the design is said to be the object around which they will do great battle.

The Eye appears in one frame of the Alias title sequence (seasons 1-3) after all the letters in the word Alias appear. In season one and three, it flashes as ALIAS is spelled out and Victor Garber&#x27;s credit appears. In season two, it appears on ALIAS when &quot;With Lena Olin&quot; appears. Season four doesn&#x27;t have a Rambaldi sign, but it appears in season five when Balthazar Getty appears.

===Rambaldi&#x27;s prophecies===
One of Rambaldi&#x27;s prophecies is central to the &quot;Alias&quot; story arc. Written on the forty-seventh page of one of his manuscripts, it reads:

:&quot;This woman here depicted will possess unseen marks, signs that she will be the one to bring forth my works: bind them with fury, a burning anger. Unless prevented, at vulgar cost, this woman will render the greatest power unto utter desolation. This woman, without pretense, will have had her effect, never having seen the beauty of my sky behind Mt. Subasio. Perhaps a single glance would have quelled her fire.&quot;

Included with the prophecy is a drawing of a woman that strongly resembles CIA Agent Sydney Bristow and because it stated that she would &quot;render the greatest power unto utter desolation&quot;, Sydney was apprehended by the Department of Special Research. The prophecy also mentioned three physical anomalies which Sydney also has. Sydney is eventually rescued before her cover as a CIA agent is blown and she tries to disprove the prophecy refers to her by climbing Mt. Subasio and see the sky.

After Sydney removed the chances of her being &#x27;The Chosen One&#x27;, she realized that if she managed to fool the police, couldn&#x27;t her mother have done the same? Eventually the Department of Special Research refocused their efforts on trying to track down Sydney&#x27;s mother, Irina Derevko, after it was revealed she was still alive.

In the season two finale, Irina reveals that Sydney is actually Rambaldi&#x27;s Chosen One, and not Irina as Sydney wanted to believe and that Sydney is the only one capable of stopping Sloane.

During Season Three, an organization known as The Covenant tried to use a Rambaldi artifact known as &quot;The Cube&quot;, which contained a live sample of Rambaldi&#x27;s DNA to fulfill the prophecy by fusing Rambaldi&#x27;s DNA with Sydney&#x27;s eggs to engineer Rambaldi&#x27;s second coming. Sydney prevented this by destroying the lab where the procedure was underway.

When FBI Assistant Director Kendall tells Sydney the truth about the two years she was missing, he mentions that she&#x27;s a celebrity among the Department of Special Research as she was the one to collect the most part of Rambaldi&#x27;s works.

During Season Three (Episode 20), another prophecy was revealed to Michael Vaughn. It says that the &quot;Chosen One&quot;, the woman referred to on Page 47, and &quot;the Passenger&quot;, revealed to be Sydney&#x27;s half-sister Nadia Santos, would fight and kill each other in battle. Irina Derevko recites a similar prophecy at the finale of season 4 that Rambaldi wrote:

:&quot;When blood-red horses wander the streets and angels fall from the sky, the Chosen One and the Passenger will clash . . . and only one will survive.&quot;

When Elena Derevko put in motion her scheme to destroy civilization using the contaminated water in conjunction with a giant Mueller device, the team spotted a horse that under the light of the device appeared blood red (which prompted Irina to recite the prophecy); Nadia passed a statue of an angel which had fallen from a building right before she was captured and later becomes infected with the contaminated water.

As predicted by Rambaldi, &quot;The Chosen One&quot; and &quot;The Passenger&quot; clashed over the Mueller device, and Sydney would have been killed if not for Arvin Sloane&#x27;s intervention when he was forced to shoot Nadia when she began strangling Sydney. Sydney then destroyed the Mueller device and Nadia is left in a coma.

In Season Five, it is revealed that page 47 holds a secret message, which is briefly shown when Nadia after being cured tries to burn the page to prevent her father from finding it, which as predicted in the prophecy, results in Nadia&#x27;s death. Arvin Sloane eventually translates the message which reads:

:&quot;The circle will be complete when the Chosen One finds The Rose in San Chielo.&quot;

Prophet Five, using its government contacts, was able to secure Anna Espinosa&#x27;s release and later was able to genetically transform Espinosa into Sydney&#x27;s double after the latter&#x27;s DNA was sampled by Prophet Five. Sydney discovers Anna&#x27;s impersonation and kills her, then begins impersonating Anna within Prophet Five.

Sydney is sent to Italy where she is approached by Sark at a betting parlor. Believing Sydney to be Anna, he explains that the former San Chielo monastery is now the La Fossa prison. After faking a robbery, Sark and Sydney surrender to the police and are taken to La Fossa. Sark fakes an illness and is taken to the infirmary, where he fights off the guards and accesses the security system to open the door to Sydney&#x27;s cell. Sydney finds the basement, where an old man says that he has been waiting for her for a very long time. He indicates that he knows she&#x27;s the real Sydney and quotes the message from page 47 and says that he is &quot;The Rose&quot;. He then shows Sydney a wall where a drawing similar to the one on page 47 was painted, and gives her an amulet before declaring ominously and prophetically that &quot;it is only a matter of time until the stars fall from the sky, until the end of light&quot;.

In the finale of Season Five, it is revealed that Sydney had misinterpreted the part of the prophecy that refers to &quot;the beauty of my sky&quot;. Arvin Sloane shoots the ice under Sydney to prevent her (and the audience) of seeing a specific pattern on the wall inside Mt. Subasio when the rising sunlight seeps into the cavern and filters through the amulet that Sydney recovered from the Rose. Later while facing her mother, Sydney discovers that Irina had sent a virus to all the defence satellites forcing them to plunging to Earth in what appears stars falling from the sky and eventually the end of light comes indicating the end of the series.

===Rambaldi&#x27;s endgame===
As revealed in the final three episodes of season four, the first part of Rambaldi&#x27;s endgame was the Mueller Device (which could be used to change human nature to hatred or peace, depending on the desire of the possessor, as wanted). The second part of the endgame was The Horizon (immortality), as revealed at the end of season five. Together, they would result in the possessor living forever and, with the help of the Mueller Device, changing the world the way they see fit for all eternity. However, this was averted when all known Mueller Devices were destroyed and Sloane, the only known beneficiary of The Horizon, was trapped in Rambaldi&#x27;s own tomb by an explosion, left to exist but never be free for all eternity.

==Emily Sloane==

Emily Sloane was portrayed by Amy Irving.

Emily Sloane was married to SD-6 head Arvin Sloane for more than 30 years. Little is known of her life outside of her marriage to Arvin. She had worked for the State Department for several years but whether this was before or during her marriage is unknown. She was an avid gardener. She and Arvin had one child, Jacquelyn, who died in infancy. Her grief was so great that she asked Arvin never to mention their child again.

When Irina Derevko, Sydney&#x27;s mother, faked her death when Sydney was six, Sydney&#x27;s father, Jack, was taken into federal custody. He named Arvin and Emily as Sydney&#x27;s temporary guardians. Why Sydney would later state in multiple episodes she did not meet Arvin or Emily until after she had started working for SD-6 is unknown. Sydney stated she considered Emily her real mother.

During season 1, Emily is near death from lymphoma. Sydney visits her in an SD-6 hospital, where Emily reveals she knows Arvin doesn&#x27;t really work for a bank and she knows of the existence of SD-6 (although she apparently believes it is affiliated with the CIA). Under security protocols, Sydney is required to report her to SD-6 Security Section but does not. SD-6 finds her out anyway and Arvin is ordered to execute her. He pleads for a reprieve on the grounds her cancer will soon kill her anyway and his request is granted. Emily&#x27;s cancer goes into total remission and Arvin is again ordered to kill her. Instead, over the end of season 1 and the beginning of season 2, he hatches an elaborate scheme to fake her death and spirits her away to an isolated island. There, he confesses to her the true nature of SD-6. Initially horrified, Emily&#x27;s love for Arvin leads her to forgive him and they remain together.

With the downfall of SD-6 and the Alliance, Sloane (now an internationally wanted terrorist) tells Emily they&#x27;re &quot;free&quot; and leads her to believe he has finally left behind his deceptions. Emily and Arvin relocate to a villa in Tuscany, but because of the possibility, they have been compromised Sloane relocates them again. Emily learns Irina, whom she knew as Laura Bristow and thought was dead, is still alive and working with her husband. Arvin tells Emily everything he&#x27;s done is to assure she remains cancer-free forever.

Distraught, Emily goes to the American consulate in Florence, announces she is Sloane&#x27;s wife and demands to speak to Sydney. Sydney makes contact with Emily, who tells her she won&#x27;t be the excuse for Arvin&#x27;s crimes. She volunteers to help bring Arvin in but demands a guarantee Arvin will not be sentenced to death.

The CIA makes the deal, and Emily returns to Tuscany wearing a wire. Unbeknownst to her, Arvin is making a deal to sell all of his assets, contacts and Rambaldi artifacts to Irina. At the last moment, after an emotional talk with Arvin, Emily switches sides again. She reveals the wire to Arvin and then disconnects it, and they attempt to escape from the CIA. Marcus Dixon, aiming for Sloane, accidentally shoots and kills Emily instead.

Emily&#x27;s final appearance in the series is in a flashback in the season 4 episode &quot;In Dreams...,&quot; which is when the existence of Jacquelyn is revealed.

<text>The Confederated States of the Rhine, simply known as the Confederation of the Rhine or Rhine Confederation, was a confederation of German client states established at the behest of Napoleon some months after he defeated Austria and Russia at the Battle of Austerlitz. Its creation brought about the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire shortly afterward. The Confederation of the Rhine lasted for only seven years, from 1806 to 1813, dissolving after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in the  War of the Sixth Coalition.

The founding members of the confederation were German princes of the Holy Roman Empire. They were later joined by 19 others, altogether ruling a total of over 15 million people. This granted a significant strategic advantage to the French Empire on its eastern frontier by providing a buffer between France and the two largest German states, Prussia and Austria (which also controlled substantial non-German lands).

==Background==
After the Treaty of Lunéville, which saw the annexation of the German territories of the left bank of the Rhine occupied by France, a new order of Central European states was established. The Final Imperial Recess of 1803 led to a radical transformation within the Holy Roman Empire. Some 112 immediate territories east of the Rhine were absorbed by larger states. Over three million people were affected by this change. All ecclesiastical territories save one were secularized and most free imperial cities underwent mediatisation. Besides Prussia, the Electorate of Baden and the Duchy of Württemberg benefited the most from these changes. The disappearance of ecclesiastical territories meant the emperor lost important political support. The end of the crippled Holy Roman Empire was foreseeable. Francis II took the title of Emperor of Austria in 1804 to counter the loss of prestige. When the War of the Third Coalition broke out in 1805, with Russia, Austria and Great Britain on the one side and France on the other, Bavaria, Baden and Wurttemberg allied with Napoleon.

After the victory at Austerlitz and the resultant Peace of Pressburg in 1805, Napoleon could significantly reassert his position in the German states. Furthermore, Austria had to concede territory and Napoleon named his brothers Joseph and Louis kings of Naples and Holland, respectively, and his brother-in-law Joachim Murat, Grand Duke of Berg. He also worked toward establishing an alliance with Baden, Bavaria and Württemberg. Francis II had to assent to the elevation of both Bavaria and Württemberg to the rank of kingdom and Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt and Berg to that of grand duchy. With French encouragement, the vestiges of small Imperial estates in the region were annexed. This reorganisation of the right bank of the Rhine laid the groundwork for the Confederation of the Rhine.

==Formation==

The formation of the Confederation of the Rhine was not altogether a voluntary option for its future member states. Negotiations between France and the princes who had been selected by Napoleon to be members of the future alliance had been dragging on for the first six months of 1806 when Napoleon decided to rush things. On 12 July, the Paris envoys of the various princes were summoned to the ministry of Foreign Affairs to find themselves instructed by Talleyrand to sign the treaty of the new alliance, whose terms had been decided between him and Napoleon. This caused consternation among the envoys given that the terms were far more onerous for the princes than what had been expected. They all protested that they were not empowered to sign before their masters authorized them to do so, but Talleyrand compelled them to sign then and there and so they did under duress. King Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria, who alone among the princes had been sent a copy of the proposed treaty, was aghast. Among other things, Bavaria would lose control of its foreign policy which would now be in the hands of Napoleon, the &quot;Protector of the Confederation&quot; . He hurriedly sent Baron Karl von Gravenreuth to Paris with instructions to reject a confederation which he said gave to the Protector a power &quot;more extensive than the Emperor of Germany ever had&quot;. Von Gravenreuth was detained long enough at the French border so that when he finally arrived in Paris all the other princes had signed. He therefore found it unadvisable to deliver the King’s views on the matter. In the words of Enno E. Kraehe: &quot;Only by such crude methods was Napoleon able at last to found the Confederation of the Rhine&quot;.

On signing the Treaty of the Confederation of the Rhine (), 16 German states joined in a loose confederation of sovereign states (the treaty called it the &quot;&quot;. The &quot;Protector of the Confederation&quot; was a hereditary office of the Emperor of the French, Napoleon. On 1 August, as the treaty compelled them to do, the members of the confederation formally seceded from the Holy Roman Empire, and on 6 August, following an ultimatum by Napoleon, Francis II, who had already proclaimed himself Emperor of Austria in 1804, declared the Holy Roman Empire dissolved.
According to the treaty, the confederation was to be run by common constitutional bodies, but the individual states (in particular the larger ones) wanted unlimited sovereignty. Instead of a monarchical head of state, as the Holy Roman Emperor had been, its highest office was held by Karl Theodor von Dalberg, the former Arch Chancellor, who now bore the title of a Prince-Primate of the confederation. As such, he was President of the College of Kings and presided over the &quot;Diet of the Confederation,&quot; designed to be a parliament-like body although it never actually assembled. The President of the Council of the Princes was the Prince of Nassau-Usingen.

In return for their support of Napoleon, some rulers were given higher statuses: Baden, Hesse, Cleves, and Berg were made into grand duchies, and Württemberg and Bavaria became kingdoms. Several member states were also enlarged with the absorption of the territories of Imperial counts and knights who were mediatized at that time. They had to pay a very high price for their new status, however. The Confederation was above all a military alliance; the member states had to maintain substantial armies for mutual defense and supply France with large numbers of military personnel. As events played out, the members of the confederation found themselves more subordinated to Napoleon than they had been to the Habsburgs when they were within the Holy Roman Empire. In order to add luster to his newly-founded dynasty, the French Emperor pressed hard to arrange a marriage between his step-son Eugène de Beauharnais and Augusta of Bavaria. Napoleon had already contemplated marrying Beauharnais to a Wittelsbach princess in 1804 but it was only in 1806, following his elevation to the status of king, that Max Joseph gave in to Napoleon’s pressure. Other royal marriages were arranged between Stéphanie de Beauharnais and Charles of Baden and Jérôme Bonaparte and Catharina of Württemberg.

After Prussia lost to France in 1806, Napoleon cajoled most of the secondary states of Germany into the Confederation of the Rhine. Eventually, an additional 23 German states joined the Confederation. It was at its largest in 1808, when it included 36 states—four kingdoms, five grand duchies, 13 duchies, seventeen principalities, and the Free Hansa towns of Hamburg, Lübeck, and Bremen. The west bank of the Rhine and the Principality of Erfurt had been annexed outright by the French Empire. Thus, as either emperor of the French or protector of the Confederation of the Rhine, Napoleon was now the overlord of all of Germany except Austria, Prussia, Danish Holstein, and Swedish Pomerania, plus previously independent Switzerland, which were not included in the Confederation.
In 1810 large parts of what is now northwest Germany were quickly annexed to France in order to better monitor the trade embargo with Great Britain, the Continental System.

The Confederation of the Rhine collapsed in 1813, in the aftermath of Napoleon&#x27;s failed invasion of the Russian Empire. Many of its members changed sides after the Battle of Leipzig, when it became apparent Napoleon would lose the War of the Sixth Coalition.

==Types of states within the Confederation==

Both French influence and internal autonomy varied greatly throughout the confederation&#x27;s existence. There was also a great variation between the power and influence of the individual states. There are three basic types:

* The first group formed the &quot;Model States&quot;, which were mostly ruled by relatives of Napoleon. These include the Kingdom of Westphalia under Jérôme Bonaparte. The Grand Duchy of Berg was first administered by Joachim Murat before he was appointed King of Naples in 1808, and then by Napoleon himself. The third model state was the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt, which was run by the house of Dalberg until 1813. Because of the collapse of the Napoleonic supremacy, this position could no longer justify its own existence. These new foundations were intended to serve as a model for the remaining Rhine federal states through their legal and social policies, such as the Napoleonic Code.
*The second group were the reform states of Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden, and Hesse-Darmstadt. These were not dependent areas but in many ways Napoleon&#x27;s true allies. Although these states took inspiration from the French model, they also went their own way. The historian Lothar Gall suggested that the rulers of the Confederation of the Rhine were made revolutionaries by Napoleon himself. Opposition to the emperor would have been possible only by renouncing the power that he had given to them. &quot;He had not made satellites which were politically incapable of action and forced to be obedient through use of force, but real allies who followed in his well-understood policy reasons of state.&quot;
*A third group formed the states that joined after 1806. These included the numerous smaller northern and central German territories, except for Saxony. In these, the internal changes were minimal. The reforms remained significantly limited in these states. However, there were also considerable differences among these states. In Mecklenburg and Saxony, the old structures remained almost unchanged. In the Duchy of Nassau, on the other hand, Minister Ernst Franz Ludwig Marshal von Bieberstein ensured moderate administrative modernization and the introduction of religious tolerance.

==Aftermath==
The allies opposing Napoleon dissolved the Confederation of the Rhine on 4 November 1813. After its demise, the only attempt at political coordination in Germany until the creation on 8 June 1815 of the German Confederation was a body called the Central Administration Council (); its president was Heinrich Friedrich Karl Reichsfreiherr vom und zum Stein (1757–1831). It was dissolved on 20 June 1815.

On 30 May 1814 the Treaty of Paris declared the German states independent.

In 1814–1815, the Congress of Vienna redrew the continent&#x27;s political map. Napoleonic creations such as the huge Kingdom of Westphalia, the Grand Duchy of Berg and the Duchy of Würzburg were abolished; suppressed states, including Hanover, the Brunswick duchies, Hesse-Kassel and Oldenburg, were reinstated. On the other hand, most members of the Confederation of the Rhine located in central and southern Germany survived with minor border changes. They, along with the reinstated states, Prussia, and Austria, formed the German Confederation.

<doc id="517891" wikidata="Q1922080" url="?curid=517891" title="Mersea Island">
<text>Mersea Island is an island in Essex, England, in the Blackwater and Colne estuaries to the south-east of Colchester. Its name comes from the Old English word &quot;meresig&quot;, meaning &quot;island of the pool&quot; and thus is tautological. The island is split into two main areas, West Mersea and East Mersea, and connected to the mainland by the Strood, a causeway that can flood at high tide.

The island has been inhabited since pre-Roman times. It was used as a holiday destination in Roman Britain for occupants of &quot;Camulodunum&quot; (Colchester). Fishing has been a key industry on the island since then, particularly oysters, and along with tourism makes up a significant part of the island&#x27;s economy. The Church of St Peter &amp; St Paul in West Mersea is thought to have existed since the 7th century, while the Church of St Edmund in East Mersea dates from around the 12th or 13th century. The island became popular with smugglers from the 16th to the 19th century. It became a focal point for troops in both world wars, and a number of observation posts can still be found on the island. Tourism remains popular, and there are a number of beach huts and holiday parks on the island. A week-long festival of boat racing, Mersea Week, takes place every summer.

==Geography==

The island lies south of Colchester and east of the county town, Chelmsford. It is the most easterly inhabited and publicly accessible island in the United Kingdom and is one of 43 (unbridged) tidal islands which can be accessed on foot or by road from the British mainland. It is situated in the estuary area of the Blackwater and Colne rivers and has an area of around . It is formed by the Pyefleet Channel to the north and the Strood Channel to the west, which connect the Blackwater to the Colne. The much smaller Ray Island lies adjacent to the north while the uninhabited Packing Marsh and Cobmarsh Islands lie to southwest. Most of the area immediately surrounding the island consists of saltmarsh and mudflats, and is an important sanctuary for wading and migratory birds. The island itself sits on a mix of London Clay, chalky boulder clay, sand and gravel.

Internally, the island is split between West Mersea, which is the main inhabited area containing the jetty and marina, and East Mersea, which is predominantly farmland and includes Cudmore Grove County Park to the east. There is also a small hamlet at Barrow Hill to the north of West Mersea. The land immediately facing the Blackwater is known as the Mersea flats, which is mostly beach that dries at low tide. The former Bradwell Power Station can be seen on the other side. West Mersea can be further divided into three areas. The Old City in the southwest of West Mersea serves the fishing and yachting industries and contains a number of listed buildings. The centre contains the church of St Peter &amp; St Paul, while the beach and esplanade are to the south.

The name &#x27;Mersea&#x27; is derived from the Old English word &quot;meresig&quot; meaning &#x27;island of the pool&#x27;. It is mentioned in the Domesday Book as &quot;Meresai&quot;. The Strood is derived from &quot;strod&quot;, meaning &#x27;marshy land&#x27;.

==Economy==

The main industries on Mersea are farming, fishing and servicing the leisure boating and yachting industry. Oysters have been harvested off the island since Roman times, and are shipped worldwide. The extensive history and association with the oyster trade attracts a significant number of tourists each year, though today the trade is predominantly with Pacific oysters that have been introduced to the area. The Essex oyster fishery is opened by the Mayor of Colchester every September.

Many small shops and ice cream businesses serve the tourism on Mersea&#x27;s seafront. The Two Sugars Cafe is sited on a former World War II pillbox near the beach.

There are six camping and caravanning sites on the island, which help contribute towards the island&#x27;s economy during the summer months. The largest is Cooper&#x27;s Beach, which caters to 3,000 residents.
==History==

There is evidence of pre-Roman settlement on Mersea in the form of &quot;red hills&quot; that are the remains of Celtic salt workings. A large Romano-British round barrow near the Strood contained the remains of a cremated adult in a glass urn, within a lead casket, now in the local Mersea Museum. In 1730, a large mosaic floor was found underneath the Church of St Peter &amp; St Paul at West Mersea and in 1764, Richard Gough discovered further evidence of Roman remains around the church. West Mersea was believed to be a holiday destination for Romans staying at &quot;Camulodunum&quot; (Colchester).

Evidence has shown a number of fish traps exist around the island, which date from around the 7th century. The Anglo-Saxons established a large fish weir at Besom Fleet to the southwest of the island and built the church at West Mersea. It was damaged by Norse raiders in 894 and rebuilt afterwards. The west tower was added to the church around the 11th century, the south aisle in the 15th and various other rebuilds continued towards the end of the 18th century.

The Strood causeway was also built by the Saxons; oak piles discovered in 1978 have been dated to between 684 and 702 using dendrochronology. By 950, there was a Benedictine priory at West Mersea and land here was granted to the Abbey of St Ouen in France by Edward the Confessor in 1046. The priory survived until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1542.
The Parish Church of St Edmund in East Mersea dates from around the 12th or 13th century, with extensions in the late 15th or 16th. The church and hall are surrounded by a moat that is thought to be the remains of a Danish refuge after their defeat by King Alfred at Farnham.

In 1547, King Henry VIII built a blockhouse or bulwark at East Mersea, an earthwork fort for up to six guns with a drawbridge. The keepers in the 1570s were two veteran soldiers Henry Jordan and Edmund Martyn. In the English Civil War, it was taken in 1648 by the Parliamentary Army, with the aim of blockading the River Colne during the siege of Colchester. Although described as ruinous in 1768, the earthworks were reused in 1798 as a gun battery for six 24-pounder long guns. The remains of this blockhouse are legally protected by Historic England as a scheduled monument. and are known as the Block House Stone.

Fishing grew in importance on the island during this time, with numerous fish weirs being installed. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Dutch and French settlers arrived on the island. Some locals supplemented their income from the oyster trade by smuggling, which remained popular until the mid-19th century. Smugglers favoured the Peldon Rose, immediately north of the Strood, where they would store contraband in the pond alongside the inn. In the early 19th century, the increased demand for oysters despite a limited supply from the Strood and Pyefleet Channel led traders to get oysters from other places and pass them off as native to the island.
By the end of the 19th century, the land around the island had been partially reclaimed, allowing easier access. A police officer for the island was appointed in 1844 and a school was opened in 1871.

In the First World War, 320 soldiers came from Mersea Island, of which 50 lost their lives. They are commemorated at the War Memorial at the parish church. Troops were stationed at Mersea Island during the war. In 1916, a Zeppelin crash landed at nearby Great Wigborough to the northwest of the island. The survivors were stationed at Mersea before moving to prisoner-of-war camps. In 2013, the Mersea Island Tales Educational Trust obtained a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to set up a First World War exhibition at Ivy Farm, which features a 1916 Sopwith Pup biplane and information about soldiers from Mersea who took part in the war.

In 1926, West Mersea became a self-governing urban district, which allowed it to set up a self-contained water and sewer system. Unlike several other coastal resorts, the island did not immediately develop any holidaymaker facilities aside from the beach huts which now stretch along the Esplanade.

At the outbreak of World War II, the island became part of the front line for invasion and was heavily fortified. Along with other coastal resorts, the island drew in evacuees from London, though as the war progressed, these were moved to safer settlements further inland. 2000 troops were stationed on the island to guard against invasion. A battery of 4.7 inch guns was installed along the beach along with a Battery Observation post and a number of searchlights and pillboxes. Several of these installations survived and can still be seen along the south coast of the island, one of which has been converted into a cafe. After the war, the island suffered from severe winter weather in 1947 which destroyed much of the oyster fishery, and from the flooding of 1953, where numerous beach huts were swept out to sea.
In 1963, a lifeboat service was launched following an initiative by &quot;Diggle&quot; Hayward who had approached the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) about a lifeboat capability on Mersea. The West Mersea Lifeboat Station operates an Atlantic 85 class lifeboat, the &quot;RNLB Just George B-879.&quot;

Since the 1960s, the population has increased considerably, with the population of West Mersea rising from 3,140 in 1961 to 6,925 in 2001. Mersea Island has suffered less from the increased popularity of holidaying abroad when compared to nearby resorts such as Clacton and Southend, predominantly due to its isolated and rural atmosphere, and the continued popularity of sailing. In 2006, more than a thousand locals signed a petition against the proposed opening of a Tesco Express store on the island, expressing concern that it would take trade away from local businesses. Planning permission was granted the following year.

On 4 June 2012, as part of the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee celebrations, the island declared a mock independence from the UK for that day. Anyone travelling to the island across the Strood paid 50p for a &quot;passport&quot;, the proceeds of which went towards the war veteran charity Help for Heroes.

==Education==
Mersea Island School is a foundation primary school in West Mersea with 450 pupils aged 4–11. The school has an additional nursery for 52 children aged 2–4. The school was built by Horace Darken in 1871–72, with additional classrooms added in 1897.

There are no secondary schools on the island. The nearest are Thomas Lord Audley School in Colchester and Thurstable School in Tiptree.

==Transport==

The main access to the island is via a causeway known as the Strood, carrying the Mersea–Colchester road (B1025). The road can be covered for up to an hour at high tide, especially during spring tides. On average the causeway is flooded at high tide for a week per month. During the 1953 North Sea flood, the Strood was submerged under over of water, cutting off access to the mainland. In 2012, West Mersea Lifeboats complained to Essex County Council about the lack of adequate signage after 13 people had to be rescued from the Strood at high tide in less than 24 hours. A webcam provides a live view of access across the Strood, while a corresponding website lists upcoming high tides and the likelihood of obstructing the road.

There has never been a railway to Mersea Island. During the railway mania of the mid-19th century, goods were transported by boat and barge. In 1911, local businessmen proposed a railway between Colchester and the island, which would have ended at a pier next to the Esplanade in the south, with an additional station in West Mersea on what is now East Road. The plans were abandoned due to the First World War.

A regular bus service links West and, infrequently, East Mersea to Colchester via the Strood and Abberton. A foot ferry runs from East Mersea to Point Clear and Brightlingsea on the other side of the Colne estuary, including a scheduled service in the summer and a dial-on-demand service in the spring and autumn.

==Culture==

The island is used as a setting for several works by Margery Allingham, who spent childhood holidays on the island. These include her first novel, &quot;Blackkerchief Dick&quot;, published in 1923 when she was 19, and her 1930 novel &quot;Mystery Mile&quot;, although the plot disguises the location as being in Suffolk. Between 1870 and 1881 the Rector of East Mersea was the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould. Baring-Gould was the writer of the hymn &quot;Onward, Christian Soldiers&quot; and the author of the novel &quot;Mehalah: A Story of the Salt Marshes&quot; which was set in Mersea.

East Mersea was a site in the Survey of English Dialects in the 1950s. The island retained some rhoticity, which had otherwise died out in eastern England.

The Mersea Week is a week-long August festival of boat racing organised by the West Mersea Yacht Club and Dabchicks Sailing Club, established in 1973. During the week, starting on Monday, there are races for many boat classes in the Blackwater Estuary, from Optimist dinghies to large yachts. The most celebrated event is the Round-the-Island race, where dinghies attempt to sail round the island in either direction, helped over the Strood by volunteers. On Saturday, there is a regatta at West Mersea, followed by a selection of water sports and a firework display at dusk. One of the popular events on Saturday is walking a greasy pole rigged over the side of the hosting Thames sailing barge.

The Mersea Island Food, Drink &amp; Leisure Festival takes place in May in the Mersea Vineyard. It combines a food theatre showing various meals, particularly oysters, with local live music and storytelling.

The island is home to Mersea Island F.C., who compete in the Essex and Suffolk Border Football League Division 1. There is a youth football team, Oyster F.C.

There is a public library on the island, located in West Mersea, run by Essex County Council.

<doc id="517914" wikidata="Q1234747" url="?curid=517914" title="Nailsworth">
<text>Nailsworth is a town and civil parish in the Stroud District in Gloucestershire, England, lying in one of the Stroud Valleys in the Cotswolds, on the A46 road, south of Stroud and about north-east of Bristol and Bath. The parish had a population of 5,794 at the 2011 census.

==History==

Nailsworth in ancient times was a settlement at the confluence of the Avening Valley and the Woodchester Valley, on the Nailsworth Stream. Among many notable historic medieval buildings in the area are Beverston Castle and Owlpen Manor. Nailsworth Town Hall, built as a chapel for a dissenting congregation, was completed in 1867.

In the modern era, Nailsworth was a small mill town and centre for brewing, powered by Nailsworth Stream. It was connected directly to the UK national rail network between 1867 and 1947, as the terminus of the Stonehouse and Nailsworth Railway.

==Amenities==
These days Nailsworth is visited in the summer by walkers. It holds a farmers&#x27; market every fourth Saturday in the month. Local events such as the market and the Nailsworth Festival are still announced by a town crier.

Over the past decade the small town centre has been reinvigorated. Besides numerous restaurants and cafes, it now contains a number of shops, including bakers, a delicatessen with a fishmonger, a hardware store, butchers, craft shops, bookshops, art galleries and a gardening shop. Nailsworth is a Fairtrade Town and twinned with the French town of Lèves, with which it enjoys an exchange visit in alternate years.

Nailsworth remains connected by regular public transport; it is the terminus of the hourly Stagecoach Gold bus route 63 from Gloucester via Stroud.

==St George&#x27;s Church==

Built on the higher ground at the centre of town, St George&#x27;s was consecrated in November 1900. Before 1895, the Church of England had provided for Nailsworth through several neighbouring parishes. The new church, which can now seat 500, was designed in the Early English style by M. H. Medland of Gloucester. A shortfall in funding meant that neither a tower or a chancel was provided. The large entrance was originally designed as a tower, but the elevated ground was found to be too unstable to support the weight, resulting in the unusual porch. A chancel, the Lady Chapel, and vestries were added in 1939, commemorating those from the town who died in World War I. In 1980 a parish room was completed. The church has no churchyard.

Three of the stained-glass windows in the south aisle, depicting St Luke, St Paul and St Barnabas, are by Charles Eamer Kempe. Three others depict St Richard of Chichester, St George and St Martin of Tours. A further window, by Herbert Bryans, shows Anna the Prophetess (&quot;Luke&quot; 2:36–38) The East window was designed by Peter Strong and installed in 1977. On the west wall is a mural painted by Sir Oliver Heywood in 1985, showing community life in the town.

==Christ Church and Tabernacle Church==

In 1837, the Baptist chapel at Shortwood was rebuilt and by 1851 was serving a congregation of over 1,000 despite an exodus of nearly 100 members to Australia in the previous decade. In 1864 disagreements over the appointment of a new minister saw a secession, with some members leaving to open the Nailsworth Tabernacle Church. The division lasted until 1910. In the 1960s, Shortwood, in conjunction with the Forest Green Congregationalists, established a new church, Christ Church. In 1972 the Shortwood congregation joined the United Reformed Church.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name exists. This mainly covers Nailsworth, but also stretches south to Horsley. The total ward population at the 2011 census was 6,614.

===Twinned===
Nailsworth is twinned with Lèves, France.
On November 27, 2019, Nailsworth signed a Friendship Agreement with the Village of Perry, New York, United States of America.

==Sport and recreation==
Forest Green Rovers is the premier football club in Nailsworth and at The New Lawn stadium in Forest Green. After winning the 2017 National League Play-off Final the club were promoted to League 2, making Nailsworth the smallest settlement ever to host an English Football League team. They were crowned League 2 champions in 2022, but immediately relegated from EFL League One the following season. They were relegated to the National League the following season. The town also has a non-League football club, Shortwood United F.C. at the Meadowbank Ground in Shortwood. It plays in the , part of the tenth tier of the English football league system.

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from either of the one local relay transmitters (Nailsworth and Stroud). Local radio stations are BBC Radio Gloucestershire on 95 FM and Heart West on 103 FM. The Stroud News and Journal is the weekly local newspaper that serves the town. A magazine, Nailsworth News, is produced by volunteers and delivered to all houses in the Parish. It has 10 issues a year and is produced entirely by volunteers.

<text>Pearly Kings and Queens, known as pearlies, are an organised charitable tradition of working-class culture in London, England.

==Henry Croft==
The practice of wearing clothes decorated with mother-of-pearl buttons is first associated with Henry Croft (1861–1930), an orphan street sweeper who collected money for charity. At the time, London costermongers (street traders) were in the habit of wearing trousers decorated at the seams with pearl buttons that had been found by market traders. In the late 1870s, Croft adapted this to create a sequin suit to draw attention to himself and aid his fund-raising activities. In 1911 an organised pearly society was formed in Finchley, north London. 

Croft&#x27;s funeral in January 1930 was attended by 400 followers and received national media coverage. In 1934, a memorial referring to Croft as &quot;The original Pearly King&quot; was unveiled in St Pancras Cemetery and in a speech to mark the occasion he was said to have raised £5,000 for those suffering in London&#x27;s hospitals.

==Pearly organisations==

The pearlies are now divided into several active groups. Croft&#x27;s founding organisation is called the Original London Pearly Kings and Queens Association. It was reformed in 1975 and holds the majority of the original pearly titles which are City of London, Westminster, Victoria, Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Shoreditch, Islington, Dalston and Hoxton. Other groups have also been established over the years. The oldest is the Pearly Guild, which began in 1902. Modern additions include the London Pearly Kings and Queens Society, which started in 2001and the Pearly Kings and Queens Guild. Despite the rivalries, each group is associated with a church in central London and is committed to raising money for London-based charities. A parade of real-life Pearly Kings and Queens was featured at the 2012 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony.

<text>The Circassians or Circassian people, also called Cherkess or Adyghe (Adyghe and ) are a Northwest Caucasian ethnic group and nation who originated in Circassia, a region and former country in the North Caucasus.

As a consequence of the Circassian genocide, which was perpetrated by the Russian Empire during the Russo-Circassian War in the 19th century, most of the Circassian people were exiled from their ancestral homeland and consequently began living in what was then the Ottoman Empire—that is, modern-day Turkey and the rest of the Middle East. In the early 1990s, the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization estimated that there are as many as 3.7 million Circassians in diaspora in over 50 countries.

The two Circassian languages—western Adyghe and eastern Kabardian—are natively spoken by the Circassian people.

Khabzeism is their ethnic religion, which was historically practiced in Circassia since ancient times, but Sunni Islam became the dominant religion among them around the 17th century, following a long period of Islamization. Circassia has been repeatedly invaded since ancient times; its isolated terrain coupled with the strategic value external societies have placed on the region have greatly shaped the Circassian national identity as a whole.

The Circassian flag consists of a green field charged with 12 gold stars and, in the centre, three crossed arrows. The stars represent the 12 Circassian tribes: the Abzakh, the Besleney, the Bzhedugh, the Hatuqway, the Kabardians, the Mamkhegh, the Natukhaj, the Shapsugh, the Chemirgoy, the Ubykh, the Yegeruqway and the Zhaney.

Circassians have played major roles in areas where they settled: in Turkey, those of Circassian origin have had massive influence, being instrumental in the Turkish War of Independence and among the elites of Turkey&#x27;s intelligence agency. In Jordan, they founded the capital city Amman, and continue to play a major role in the country. In Syria, they served as the volunteer guards of the Allies upon their entry into the country and still have high positions. In Libya, they serve in high military positions. In Egypt, they were part of the ruling class. The largest Circassian clan in the country also contributed to Egyptian and Arabic cultural literary, intellectual, and political life starting with the reign of Muhammad Ali Pasha in Egypt and continuing to the modern day: the Abaza family. In Israel, Bibras Natcho is the captain of the Israeli national soccer team.

In Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union, historical Circassia was divided into the republics of Adygea, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, and Krasnodar Krai, and southwestern parts of Stavropol Krai.

Accordingly, Circassians have been designated as &quot;Adygeans&quot; in Adygea, &quot;Kabardians&quot; in Kabardino-Balkaria, &quot;Cherkess&quot; in Karachay-Cherkessia, and &quot;Shapsug&quot; in Krasnodar Krai; all four are essentially the same people. Today, approximately 800,000 Circassians remain in historical Circassia, while 4,500,000 live elsewhere.

==Ethnonyms==
===Adyghe===

The Circassians refer to themselves as &quot;Adyghe&quot; (also transliterated as &quot;Adyga, Adiga, Adige, Adığe,&quot; &quot;Adyge&quot;, &quot;Adygei&quot;). According to one view, the name derives from &quot;Atyghe&quot; () meaning &quot;high [in altitude]&quot; to signify a mountaineer, as the Circassian people have lived in and near the mountains for thousands of years.

===Circassian, Cherkess===
The word &quot;Circassian&quot; ( ) is an exonym, Latinized from Russian &quot;Cherkess&quot; (; ), which is of debated origin. The term, in Russian, was traditionally applied to all Circassians before Soviet times, but it has since usually referred only to Circassians living in northern Karachay-Cherkessia, a federal subject of Russia, where they are indigenous and were about 12% of the population in 2010. In English, it still refers to all Circassians.

The origin of the term &quot;Circassian&quot; is disputed. One view is that its root stems from Turkic languages, and means &quot;head choppers&quot; or &quot;warrior killers&quot;, because of the Circassians&#x27; battle practices. Other sources argue that the term comes from Mongolian &quot;Jerkes&quot;, meaning &quot;one who blocks a path&quot;. Some believe it comes from the ancient Greek name of the region, Siraces. According to another view, its origin is Persian and combines two parts, &quot;kar&quot; (&quot;mountain&quot;) and &quot;kās&quot; (&quot;region&quot;, in Pahlavi), meaning &quot;mountainous region&quot;. The spelling &quot;Cherkess&quot; may be an abbreviation of Persian &quot;Chahār-kas&quot; (&quot;four people&quot;), denoting four tribes. Ali ibn al-Athir (died c. 1232/3) and Ibn Khaldun (died 1406) used the term &quot;Jahārkas&quot;, but the Persian hypothesis remains uncertain.

In early Russian sources, Circassians are called &quot;Kasogi&quot;, but one view holds that the modern term &quot;Cherkes&quot; derives from &quot;Kerket&quot;, the name of one of the ancient Circassian tribes.

In languages spoken geographically close to the Caucasus, the native people originally had other names for the Circassians (such as Georgian: ჯიქი, &quot;Jiqi&quot;), but with Russian influence, the name has been settled as &quot;Cherkess&quot;. It is the same or similar in many world languages that cite these languages.

The &quot;Encyclopaedia Islamica&quot; adds: &quot;The Cherkess: the Kabardians and the western Adyghe people share a common language, which is spoken by the north-western Caucasian people, and belongs to the family known as Abkhazian-Adyghe&quot;.

In Medieval Oriental and European texts, the Adyghe people were known by the name Cherkess/Circassians. In Persian sources, &quot;Charkas/Cherkes&quot; is used to refer to the &quot;actual&quot; Circassians of the northwest Caucasus, and in some occasions as a general designation for Caucasians who live beyond Derbent (Darband).

===Soviet policy===
Despite a common self-designation and a common Russian name, Soviet authorities divided the nation into four different peoples and applied four designations to Circassians remaining in the historic lands of Circassia:
*Kabardian, Circassians of Kabardino-Balkaria (Circassians speaking the Kabardian language, one of two indigenous peoples of the republic)
*Cherkess (), Circassians of Karachay-Cherkessia (Circassians speaking the Cherkess, i.e. Circassian, language, one of two indigenous peoples of the republic who are mostly Besleney Kabardians. The name &quot;Cherkess&quot; is the Russian form of &quot;Circassian&quot; and was used for all Circassians before Soviet times.)
*Adyghe or Adygeans, the indigenous population of the Kuban including Adygea and Krasnodar Krai
*Shapsug, the indigenous historical inhabitants of Shapsugia. They live in the Tuapse District and the Lazarevsky City District (formerly the Shapsug national district) of Sochi, both in Krasnodar Krai and in Adygea.

==History==
===Origins===
Genetically, the Adyghe have shared ancestry partially with neighboring peoples of the Caucasus, with some influence from other regions. The most prevalent SNP haplotypes among all Circassian tribes is G2-YY1215 (43%); others are R1a-M198* (13%), G2-YY9632 (9%), J2-M172* (7%), sharing a single common ancestor 3,000 years ago, with the largest demographic growth between 2,000 and 1,500 years ago. Prevalence of the G2-YY1215 haplogroup is larger on the Western Caucasus and decreases to the east, while G2-YY9632 has the opposite tendency. R1a-M198* is shared with Balkars, Karachays and Kuban Cossacks.

The Circassian language, also known as Cherkess, is in the Northwest Caucasian language family. Archaeological findings, mainly of dolmens in Northwest Caucasus region, indicate a megalithic culture in the Northwest Caucasus.

The ancestors of present-day Circassians are known as the Sinti-Maeotian tribes. Archaeological research shows that these tribes were the indigenous people of the Caucasus. Some researchers have claimed there may be links between Circassians and Indo-European-speaking communities, and some have argued that there are connections between Circassians and Hatti, who are from ancient Anatolian peoples, but these theories are not widely accepted. According to genetic tests performed on Circassians, their closest relatives are Ingush, Chechens, Georgians and Abkhazians.

====Pseudoscientific claims====
Turkish nationalist groups and proponents of modern-day Pan-Turkism have claimed that the Circassians are of Turkic origin, but no scientific evidence supports this claim and it has been strongly denied by ethnic Circassians, impartial research, linguists, and historians around the world. The Circassian language does not share notable similarities to the Turkish language, except for borrowed words. According to various historians, the Circassian origin of the Sind-Meot tribes refutes the claim that the Circassians are of Turkic ethnic origin.

German racial theorists, after comparing skull shapes, declared that Europeans, North Africans, and Caucasians were of a common race, termed &quot;Caucasian&quot; or later &quot;Caucasoid&quot;. Scientific racism emphasized the so-called &quot;superior beauty&quot; of the Circassian people, referring to them as &quot;how God intended the human race to be&quot;, leading to the 18th century stereotype of the Circassian beauty.

===Medieval period===
Feudalism began to emerge among Circassians by the 4th century. As a result of Armenian, Greek and Byzantine influence, Christianity spread throughout the Caucasus between the 3rd and 5th centuries. During that period, Circassians (known at the time as &quot;Kassogs&quot;) began to accept Christianity as a national religion, but did not abandon all elements of their indigenous religious beliefs. Circassians established many states, but could not achieve political unity. From around 400, wave after wave of outsiders began to invade the lands of the Adyghe people, who were also known as the &quot;Kasogi&quot; (or Kassogs) at the time. They were conquered first by the Bulgars (who originated on the Central Asian steppes). Outsiders sometimes confused the Adyghe people with the similarly named Utigurs (a branch of the Bulgars). After the Khazar state dissolved, the Adyghe people were integrated around the end of the 1st millennium AD into the Kingdom of Alania. Between the 10th and 13th centuries Georgia had influence on the Adyghe Circassian peoples. In the medieval era there was a Circassian kingdom called Zichia (; ) or Zekchia.

In 1382, Circassian slaves took the Mamluk throne, the Burji dynasty took over and the Mamluks became a Circassian state. The Mongols, who started invading the Caucasus in 1223, destroyed some of the Circassians and most of the Alans. The Circassians lost most of their lands during the ensuing Golden Horde attacks and had to retreat to the back of the Kuban River. In 1395 Circassians fought violent wars against Tamerlane, and although they won the wars, Tamerlane plundered Circassia.

Prince Inal, who owned land in the Taman peninsula during the 1400s, established an army and declared that his goal was to unite the Circassians under a single state. They were divided into many states at that time, but after declaring his own princedom, Inal conquered all of Circassia one by one. Circassian nobles and princes tried to prevent Inal&#x27;s rise, but Inal and his supporters defeated 30 Circassian lords. After successfully uniting the Circassians, Inal still wanted to include the closely related Abkhazians. Inal, who won the war in Abkhazia, officially conquered Northern Abkhazia and the Abkhaz people recognized his rule. One of the stars on the flag of Abkhazia represents Inal. He divided his lands between his sons and grandchildren in 1453 and died in 1458. After that, Circassian tribal principalities were established, including Chemguy, founded by Temruk; Besleney, founded by Beslan; Kabardia, founded by Qabard; and Shapsug, founded by Zanoko.

=== Early modern period ===

In the 17th century, under the influence of the Crimean Tatars and of the Ottoman Empire, large numbers of Circassians converted to Islam from Christianity.

In 1708, Circassians paid tribute to the Ottoman sultan in order to prevent Tatar raids, but the sultan did not fulfill the obligation and the Tatars raided all the way to the center of Circassia, robbing everything they could. For this reason, Kabardian Circassians announced that they would never pay tribute to the Crimean Khan and the Ottoman Sultan again. The Ottomans sent their army of at least 20,000 men to Kabardia under the leadership of the Crimean Khan Kaplan-Girey to conquer the Circassians and ordered that he collect the tribute. The Ottomans expected an easy victory against the Kabardinians, but the Circassians won because of the strategy set up by Kazaniko Jabagh during the battle of Kanzhal.

The Crimean army was destroyed on 17 September 1708. The Crimean Khan Qaplan I Giray barely managed to save his life, and was humiliated, all the way to his shoes taken, leaving his brother, son, field tools, tents and personal belongings. In 2013, the Institute of Russian History of the Russian Academy of Sciences recognized that the Battle of Kinzhal Mountain with the paramount importance in the national history of Circassians, Balkarians and Ossetians.

===Circassian Genocide===
In 1714, Peter I established a plan to occupy the Caucasus. Although he was unable to implement this plan, he laid the political and ideological foundation for the occupation to take place. Catherine II started putting this plan into action. The Russian army was deployed on the banks of the Terek River.
The Russian military tried to impose authority by building a series of forts, but these forts in turn became the new targets of raids and indeed sometimes the highlanders actually captured and held the forts. Under Yermolov, the Russian military began using a strategy of disproportionate retribution for raids. Russian troops retaliated by destroying villages where resistance fighters were thought to hide, as well as employing assassinations, kidnappings, and the execution of whole families. Because the resistance was relying on sympathetic villages for food, the Russian military also systematically destroyed crops and livestock and killed Circassian civilians. Circassians responded by creating a tribal federation encompassing all tribes of the area. In 1840 Karl Friedrich Neumann estimated the Circassian casualties at around one and a half million. Some sources state that hundreds of thousands of others died during the exodus. Several historians use the phrase &quot;Circassian massacres&quot; for the consequences of Russian actions in the region.In a series of sweeping military campaigns lasting from 1860 to 1864... the northwest Caucasus and the Black Sea coast were virtually emptied of Muslim villagers. Columns of the displaced were marched either to the Kuban [River] plains or toward the coast for transport to the Ottoman Empire... One after another, entire Circassian tribal groups were dispersed, resettled, or killed en masse. Circassians established an assembly called &quot;Great Freedom Assembly&quot; in the capital city of Shashe (Sochi) on 25 June 1861. Haji Qerandiqo Berzedj was appointed as the head of the assembly. This assembly asked for help from Europe, arguing that they would be forced into exile soon. However, before the result was achieved, Russian General Kolyobakin invaded Sochi and destroyed the parliament and no country opposed this.

In May 1864, a final battle took place between the Circassian army of 20,000 Circassian horsemen and a fully equipped Russian army of 100,000 men. Circassian warriors attacked the Russian army and tried to break through the line, but most were shot down by Russian artillery and infantry. The remaining fighters continued to fight as guerillas and were soon defeated. All 20,000 Circassian horsemen died in the war. The war ended officially on 21 May 1864. The place where this war took place is known today as Krasnaya Polyana. &quot;Krasnaya Polyana&quot; means red meadow. It takes its name from the Circassian blood flowing from the hill into the river.

The proposal to deport the Circassians was ratified by the Russian government, and a flood of refugee movements began as Russian troops advanced in their final campaign. Circassians prepared to resist and hold their last stand against Russian military advances and troops. With the refusal to surrender, Circassian civilians were targeted one by one by the Russian military with thousands massacred and the Russians started to raid and burn Circassian villages, destroy the fields to make it impossible to return, cut trees down and drive the people towards the Black Sea coast.

Although it is not known exactly how many people are affected, researchers have suggested that at least 75%, 90%, 94%, or 95–97% of the ethnic Circassian population are affected. Considering these rates, calculations including those taking into account the Russian government&#x27;s own archival figures, have estimated a loss 600,000–1,500,000. Ivan Drozdov, a Russian officer who witnessed the scene at Qbaada in May 1864 as the other Russians were celebrating their victory remarked:

The Ottoman Empire regarded the Adyghe warriors as courageous and well-experienced. It encouraged them to settle in various near-border settlements of the Ottoman Empire in order to strengthen the empire&#x27;s borders.

According to Walter Richmond,

Circassia was a small independent nation on the northeastern shore of the Black Sea. For no reason other than ethnic hatred, over the course of hundreds of raids the Russians drove the Circassians from their homeland and deported them to the Ottoman Empire. At least 600,000 people lost their lives to massacre, starvation, and the elements while hundreds of thousands more were forced to leave their homeland. By 1864, three-fourths of the population was annihilated, and the Circassians had become one of the first stateless peoples in modern history.
As of 2020, Georgia was the only country to classify the events as genocide, while Russia actively denies the Circassian genocide, and classifies the events as a simple migration of &quot;undeveloped barbaric peoples&quot;.

===Post-exile period===
As early as 1859, the Russian government had sought potential avenues for expelling the native Circassian population, and found a solution in the Ottoman Empire. Despite their numerous historical and ongoing disputes, the two empires negotiated on the impending migrations and resettlements. The Russians promised a gradual process that would see the Ottomans ultimately receive fewer than 100,000 Circassians. The Circassians would first be moved, or coerced to move, to the Circassian Black Sea coast, from which Ottoman boats would take them to designated ports in Anatolia. The recently formed Ottoman &quot;Muhacirin Komisyonu&quot;, or Emigrant Commission, would coordinate both the retrieval and resettlement of the Circassians throughout the Ottoman Empire. The process of expulsion had already begun even before the end of the Russo-Circassian war; the first Circassians had begun to arrive in small numbers as early as 1859, mainly consisting of wealthier aristocrats.

Even prior to the end of the Russo-Circassian War, expelled Circassians had begun to crowd the Circassian coast in far greater numbers than the Ottomans had anticipated, easily reaching tens of thousands at a time. Conditions on the beaches were dismal, as those waiting for Ottoman-chartered ships contended with insufficient supplies of food and shelter, occasional raids from Russian soldiers, and outbreaks of typhus and smallpox that were only exacerbated by the cramped and unsanitary conditions. By 1864, hundreds of thousands of Circassians had either already entered the Ottoman Empire or still languished on the Circassian coast awaiting transit, even as far greater numbers arrived following the Russo-Circassian War&#x27;s conclusion. What was intended to be an orderly, gradual expulsion quickly eroded over the following months, as the Ottomans overcrowded boats and neglected previously enforced safety regulations. Numerous boats sank, unable to safely accommodate these larger loads, while the overcrowded conditions helped disease spread even further among both the Circassian migrants and the Ottoman crews.

Upon their arrival, the Emigrant Commission attempted to relocate most of the new arrivals as quickly as possible to alleviate the strain on Ottoman port cities, and began to settle the Circassians throughout the Ottoman Empire. The exiled Circassians were resettled in the Empire&#x27;s remaining Balkan territories, in Ottoman Syria and Transjordan, and Anatolia, while a smaller number were resettled into the Empire&#x27;s major cities.

In January 1922, the Soviet government created an autonomous oblast which was the predecessor of the Karachay-Cherkess Republic.

The actions of the Russian military in acquiring Circassian land through expulsion and massacres have given rise to a movement among descendants of the expelled ethnicities for international recognition of the perpetration of genocide. 
On 20 May 2011 the Georgian parliament voted in a 95 to 0 declaration that Russia had committed genocide when it engaged in massacres against Circassians in the 19th century.

==Culture==

Adyghe society prior to the Russian invasion was highly stratified. While a few tribes in the mountainous regions of Adygeya were fairly egalitarian, most were broken into strict castes. The highest was the caste of the &quot;princes&quot;, followed by a caste of lesser nobility, and then commoners, serfs, and slaves. In the decades before Russian rule, two tribes overthrew their traditional rulers and set up democratic processes, but this social experiment was cut short by the end of Adyghe independence.

===Language===

Circassians mainly speak the Circassian languages, two mutually intelligible languages of the Northwest Caucasian language family, namely Adyghe (West Circassian) and Kabardian (East Adyghe). Adyghe is based on Temirgoy (Chemirgoy) dialect, while Kabardian is based on the dialect of the same name. Circassians also speak Russian, Turkish, English, Arabic, and Hebrew in large numbers, having been exiled by Russia to lands of the Ottoman Empire, where the majority of them live today, and some to neighboring Persia, to which they came primarily through mass deportations by the Safavids and Qajars or, to a lesser extent, as &quot;muhajirs&quot; in the 19th century.

Linguists divide the Northwest Caucasian languages into three branches, namely Circassian (Adyghe and Kabardian), Ubykh (consisting only of the Ubykh language, which is considered to have diverged from the Circassian languages and is now a dead language), and Abazgi (Abkhaz and Abaza). The Ubykhs lived on the Black Sea coast, around the city of Sochi, the capital of Circassia, north of Abkhazia.

Although related, Abazgi and Circassian are mutually unintelligible. Abazgi is spoken by Abkhazians and the Abazins. The Abkhazians lived on the coast between the Circassians and the Georgians, were organized as the Principality of Abkhazia and were involved with the Georgians to some degree. The Abazins or Abaza, their relatives, lived north of the mountains and were involved with Circassia proper. They extended from the mountain crest northeast onto the steppe and partially separated the Kabardians from the rest. Sadz were either northern Abkhazian or eastern Abaza, depending on the source.

Walter Richmond writes that the Circassian languages in Russia are &quot;gravely threatened.&quot; He argues that Russian policy of surrounding small Circassian communities with Slavic populations has created conditions where Circassian languages and nationality will disappear. By the 1990s, Russian had become the standard language for business in the Republic of Adygea, even within communities with Circassian majority populations.

===Religion===

Ancestors of modern Adyghe people gradually went through following various religions: ancient polytheist beliefs, Christianity, and then Islam.

It is the tradition of the early church that Christianity made its first appearance in Circassia in the first century AD via the travels and preaching of the Apostle Andrew. Subsequently, Christianity spread throughout the Caucasus between the 4th century and the 6th century.

A small Muslim presence in Circassia has existed since the Middle Ages, but widespread Islamization occurred after 1717, when Sultan Murad IV ordered the Crimean Khans to spread Islam among the Circassians, with the Ottomans and Crimeans seeing some success in converting members of the aristocracy who would then ultimately spread the religion to their dependents. Moreover, the ever increasing threat of an invasion from Russia helped expedite the already centuries long process of gradual islamization of the region.

Significant Christian and pagan presence remained among some tribes such as the Shapsugs and Natukhai with Islamization pressures implemented by those loyal to the Caucasus Imamate. Sufi orders including the Qadiri and Nakshbandi orders gained prominence and played a role in spreading Islam.

Today, the vast majority of Circassians are Muslim, and significantly fewer are Habze, atheists and Christians. Among Christians, Catholicism, originally introduced along the coasts by Venetian and Genoese traders, today constitutes just under 1% of Kabardins, notably including those in Mozdok and some of those Kursky district. Among Muslims, Islamic observance varies widely between those who only know a few prayers with a Muslim identity that is more &quot;cultural&quot; than religious, to those who regularly observe all requirements.

Both Islam and the Habze are identified as national characteristics even by those that do not practice. Today, Islam is a central part of life in many Circassian diaspora communities, such as in Israel, while in the Circassian homeland Soviet rule saw an extensive process of secularization, and there is wide influence of many social norms which contradict Islamic law, such as widespread norms like social alcohol consumption; in Israel, meanwhile, such non-Islamic social norms are not present.

In the modern times, it has been reported that they identify primarily as Muslims. There have also been reports of violence and threats against those &quot;reviving&quot; and diffusing the original Circassian pre-Islamic faith. The relationship between &quot;habze&quot; and Islam varies between Circassian communities; for some, there is conflict between the two, while for others, such as in Israel, they are seen as complementary philosophies. In 2005, a representative sample study of younger generation of Circassians aged 20–35 found that some 26% of those surveyed identified as irreligious.

===Traditional social system===

Society was organized by &quot;Adyghe khabze&quot;, or Circassian custom. Many of these customs had equivalents throughout the mountains. The seemingly disorganized Circassians resisted the Russians. The aristocracy was called &quot;warq&quot;. Some aristocratic families held the rank of &quot;Pshi&quot; or prince and the eldest member of this family was the &quot;Pshi-tkhamade&quot; who was the tribal chief. Below the warq was the large class to &quot;tfokotl&quot;, roughly yeomen or freemen, who had various duties to the &quot;warq&quot;.

They were divided into clans of some sort. Below them were three classes approximating serfs or slaves. Of course, these Circassian social terms do not exactly match their European equivalents. Since everything was a matter of custom, much depended on time, place, circumstances and personality. The three &#x27;democratic&#x27; tribes, Natukhai, Shapsug, and Abdzakh, managed their affairs by assemblies called &quot;Khase&quot; or larger ones called &quot;Zafes&quot;.

Decisions were made by general agreement and there was no formal mechanism to enforce decisions. The democratic tribes, who were perhaps the majority, lived mainly in the mountains where they were relatively protected from the Russians. They seem to have retained their aristocrats, but with diminished powers. In the remaining &#x27;feudal&#x27; tribes power was theoretically in the hands of the &quot;Pshi-tkhamade&quot;, although his power could be limited by Khases or other influential families.

In addition to the vertical relations of class there were many horizontal relations between unrelated persons. There was a strong tradition of hospitality similar to the Greek &quot;xenia&quot;. Many houses would have a &quot;kunakskaya&quot; or guest room. The duty of a host extended even to &quot;abreks&quot; or outlaws. Two men might be sworn brothers or &quot;kunaks&quot;. There were brotherhoods of unrelated individuals called &quot;tleuzh&quot; who provided each other mutual support. It was common for a child to be raised by an &quot;atalyk&quot; or foster father. Criminal law was mainly concerned with reconciling the two parties. &quot;Adyghe khabze&quot; is sometimes called &quot;adat&quot; when it is contrasted to the kind of Islamic law advocated by people like Imam Shamil.

===Traditional clothing===
The traditional female clothing ( ) was very diverse and highly decorated and mainly depends on the region, class of family, occasions, and tribes. The traditional female costume is composed of a dress ( ), coat ( ), shirt, pant ( ), vest ( ), lamb leather bra ( ), a variety of hats ( ), shoes, and belts ( ).

Holiday dresses are made of expensive fabrics such as silk and velvet. The traditional colors of women&#x27;s clothing rarely includes blue, green or bright-colored tones, instead mostly white, red, black and brown shades are worn. The Circassian dresses were embroidered with gold and silver threads. These embroideries were handmade and took time to complete as they were very intricate.

The traditional male costume ( ) includes a coat with wide sleeves, shirt, pants, a dagger, sword, and a variety of hats and shoes. Traditionally, young men in the warriors&#x27; times wore coat with short sleeves—in order to feel more comfortable in combat. Different colors of clothing for males were strictly used to distinguish between different social classes, for example white is usually worn by princes, red by nobles, gray, brown, and black by peasants (blue, green and the other colors were rarely worn).

A compulsory item in the traditional male costume is a dagger and a sword. The traditional Adyghean sword is called &quot;shashka&quot;. It is a special kind of sabre; a very sharp, single-edged, single-handed, and guardless sword. Although the sword is used by most of Russian and Ukrainian Cossacks, the typically Adyghean form of the sabre is longer than the Cossack type, and in fact the word Shashka came from the Adyghe word &quot;Sashkhwa&quot; () which means &quot;long knife&quot;. On the breast of the costume are long ornamental tubes or sticks, once filled with a single charge of gunpowder (called gaziri cartridges) and used to reload muskets.

===Traditional cuisine===
The Adyghe cuisine is rich with different dishes. In the summer, the traditional dishes consumed by the Adyghe people are mainly dairy products and vegetable dishes. In the winter and spring the traditional dishes are mainly flour and meat dishes. An example of the latter is known as &quot;ficcin&quot;.

Circassian cheese is considered one of the more famous types of cheeses in the North Caucasus.

A popular traditional dish is chicken or turkey with sauce, seasoned with crushed garlic and red pepper. Mutton and beef are served boiled, usually with a seasoning of sour milk with crushed garlic and salt.

Variants of pasta are found. A type of ravioli may be encountered, which is filled with potato or beef.

On holidays the Adyghe people traditionally make &quot;haliva&quot; () (fried triangular pastries with mainly Circassian cheese or potato), from toasted millet or wheat flour in syrup, baked cakes and pies. In the Levant there is a famous Circassian dish which is called Tajen Alsharkaseiah.

===Traditional crafts===
The Adyghes have been famous for making carpets ( ) or mats worldwide for thousands of years.

Making carpets was very hard work in which collecting raw materials is restricted to a specific period within the year. The raw materials were dried, and based on the intended colours, different methods of drying were applied. For example, when dried in the shade, its colour changed to a beautiful light gold colour. If it were dried in direct sun light then it would have a silver colour, and if they wanted to have a dark colour for the carpets, the raw materials were put in a pool of water and covered by poplar leaves ( ).

The carpets were adorned with images of birds, beloved animals (horses), and plants, and the image of the Sun was widely used.

The carpets were used for different reasons due to their characteristic resistance to humidity and cold, and in retaining heat. Also, there was a tradition in Circassian homes to have two carpets hanging in the guest room, one used to hang over rifles ( ) and pistols (), and the other used to hang over musical instruments.

The carpets were used to pray upon, and it was necessary for every Circassian girl to make three carpets before marriage. These carpets would give the grooms an impression as to the success of their brides in their homes after marriage.

==Tribes==
From the late Middle Ages, a number of territorial- and political-based Circassian tribes or ethnic entities began to take shape. They had slightly different dialects.

Dialects came to exist after Circassia was divided into tribes after the death of Inal of Kabardia, who united Circassia for the last time before its short reunion during the Russo-Caucasian War. As the logistics between the tribes became harder, each tribe became slightly isolated from one another, thus the people living under the banner of each tribe developed their own dialects. In time, the dialects they speak were named after their tribes.

At the end of the Caucasian War most Circassians were expelled to the Ottoman Empire, and many of the tribes were destroyed and the people evicted from their historical homeland in 1864.

The twelve stars on the Circassian flag symbolize the individual tribes of the Circassians; the nine stars within the arc symbolize the nine aristocratic tribes of Adygea, and the three horizontal stars symbolize the three democratic tribes. The three democratic tribes or tribes were the Natukhai, Shapsug, and Abdzakh. They managed their affairs by assemblies while the other tribes were controlled by &quot;princes&quot; or &quot;Pshi&quot;. The twelve tribes are the Abdzakh, Besleney, Bzhedug, Hatuqwai, Kabardian, Mamkhegh, Natukhai, Shapsug, Temirgoy, Ubykh, Yegeruqwai, and Zhaney.

Adyghe tribes with remnants still in Circassia are: Kabarda (the largest), the Temirgoy and Bzhedug in Adygea, and the Shapsug near Tuapse and to the north of Tuapsiysiy Rayon of Krasnodarskiy Kray. There are also a few Besleney and Natukhai villages, and an Abdzakh village. The majority tribes in diaspora are Kabardian, Abdzakh, and Shapsug.

===Other Adyghe groups===
Small tribes or large clans that are included in one of the twelve Adyghe tribes:
The Circassian tribes can be grouped and compared in various ways:

*The narrow Black Sea coast was occupied, from north to south by the Natukhai, Shapsug, and Ubykh. The main part of the Natukhai and Shapsug tribes were located in the north of the mountains. The Natukhai were enriched by trade since their coast was not backed by high mountains and opened onto the steppe.
* The north slope was inhabited, from north to south, by the Natukhai, Shapsug, and Abdzakh. They seem to have been the most populous tribes after the Kabarda and its inland location gave then some protection from Nogai and Cossack raiding.
* In the far west were three small tribes that were absorbed into the Natukhai and disappeared. These were the Adele on the Taman peninsula and the Shegak and Chebsin ( and ) near Anapa.
* Along the Kuban were the Natukhai, Zhaney, Bzhedug, Hatuqwai, and Temirgoy. The tribes along the Kuban and Laba rivers were exposed to Nogai and Cossack raiding than those in the interior.
* On the east, between the Laba and Belaya, from north to south, were the Temirgoy, Yegeruqwai (), Makhosh (), and Besleney. The Besleney were a branch of the Kabardians. Along the Belaya River were the Temirgoy, the ill-documented Ademey () and then the Mamkhegh near the modern Maykop.
*The Guaye () are poorly documented. The Tchelugay lived west of the Makhosh. The Hakuch lived on the coast south of the Natukhai. Other groups are mentioned without much documentation. There are reports of tribes migrating from one place to another, again without much documentation. Some sketch maps show a group of Karachays on the upper Laba without any explanation.
* In the Far east the Kabarda occupied about a third of the north Caucasus piedmont from mid Circassia proper eastward to the Chechen country. To their north were the Nogai nomads and to the south, deeper in the mountains, were from west to east, the Karachays, Balkars, Ossetes, Ingushes, and Chechens. The Kabardians were fairly advanced, interacted with the Russians from the sixteenth century and were much reduced by plague in the early nineteenth century.

==Circassian diaspora==

The Circassian people were subjected to ethnic cleansing by the Russian military during the Caucasus War and mass exile to the Ottoman Empire. In the 1860s and the 1870s, the Ottoman government settled Circassians in territories of modern-day Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, Iraq, Georgia, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Kosovo, Greece, Cyprus, and North Macedonia. Most Circassian refugees in the Balkans had fled the region during the Russo-Ottoman War of 1877–78. However, Circassians have also lived outside the Caucasus region since the Middle Ages. They were particularly well represented in the Ottoman Empire and Egypt.

=== Turkey ===
Turkey has the largest Adyghe population in the world, around half of all Circassians live in Turkey, mainly in the provinces of Samsun and Ordu (in Northern Turkey), Kahramanmaraş (in Southern Turkey), Kayseri (in Central Turkey), Bandırma, and Düzce (in Northwest Turkey), along the shores of the Black Sea; the region near the city of Ankara. All citizens of Turkey are considered Turks by the government, but it is estimated that approximately two million ethnic Circassians live in Turkey. The &quot;Circassians&quot; in question do not always speak the languages of their ancestors, and in some cases some of them may describe themselves as &quot;only Turkish&quot;. The reason for this loss of identity is mostly due to Turkey&#x27;s Government assimilation policies and marriages with non-Circassians. Circassians are regarded by historians to play a key role in the history of Turkey. Many of the Young Turks were of Circassian origin. Some of the exiles and their descendants gained high positions in the Ottoman Empire. Until the end of the First World War, many Circassians actively served in the army. In the period after the First World War, Circassians came to the fore in Anatolia as a group of advanced armament and organizational abilities as a result of the struggle they fought with the Russian troops until they came to the Ottoman lands. However, the situation of the Ottoman Empire after the war caused them to be caught between the different balances of power between Istanbul and Ankara and even become a striking force. For this period, it is not possible to say that Circassians all acted together as in many other groups in Anatolia. The Turkish government removed 14 Circassian villages from Gönen and Manyas regions in December 1922, May and June 1923, without separating women and children, and drove them to different places in Anatolia from Konya to Sivas and Bitlis. This incident had a great impact on the assimilation of Circassians. After 1923, Circassians were restricted by policies such as the prohibition of Circassian language, changing village names, and surname law Circassians, who had many problems in maintaining their identity comfortably, were seen as a group that inevitably had to be assimilated.

Cyprus Circassians had settled in Cyprus during the Memluk period. However these were mainly members of Memluk Army and majority of them left the island during the Venetian period. Even though, Circassians have arrived to the island during the Ottoman Empire from Caucasus by ships and they settled Limasol Circassian Farm (Cerkez Ciftlik) and villages of Larnaca; Arsos (Yiğitler), Vuda, Tremetousa (Erdemli), Paralimni in October 1864. Cypriot Circassians had joined the Turkish Cypriot Community and some of them the Greek Cypriot Community. Although they lost their original language and culture, they still view themselves as Circassian.

=== Syria ===

Circassians play a major role in the history of Syria. In Syria, they settled mainly in the Golan Heights. Prior to the Six-Day War of 1967, the Adyghe people – then estimated at 30,000 in number – were the majority group in the Golan Heights region. The most prominent settlement in the Golan was the town of Quneitra. Estimates of the total number of Circassians in Syria range from 50,000 and 100,000. In 2013, as tensions between the Baath government and the opposition forces escalated, Syrian Circassians said they were exploring returning to Circassia. Circassians from different parts of Syria, such as Damascus, have moved back to the Golan Heights, believed to be safer. Some refugees have been reportedly killed by shelling. Circassians have lobbied the Russian and Israeli governments to help evacuate refugees from Syria; Russia has issued some visas.

=== Israel ===

In Israel, the Adyghe initially settled in three places—in Kfar Kama, Rehaniya, and in the region of Hadera. Due to a malaria epidemic, the Adyghe eventually abandoned the settlement near Hadera. Though Sunni Muslim, Adyghe within Israel are seen as a loyal minority who serve in the Israeli armed forces.

=== Jordan ===

The Circassians had a major role in the modern history of Jordan. Circassian refugees started arriving in Ottoman Transjordan after their expulsion from the Ottoman Balkans during the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878). Between 1878 and 1904, Circassians founded (or re-established) five sites: Amman (1878), Wadi al-Sir (1880), Jerash (1884), Na&#x27;ur (1901), and al-Rusayfa (1904). Amman was primarily a Circassian village until World War I. Amman grew rapidly thanks to Circassian agricultural labor and trade, and mercantile investment from Damascus, Nablus, and Jerusalem, made possible by the construction of the Hejaz Railway.

Over the years, various Adyghe have served in distinguished roles in the kingdom of Jordan. Adyghes have served as a prime minister (Sa&#x27;id al-Mufti), as ministers (commonly at least one minister should represent the Circassians in each cabinet), as high-ranking officers, etc., and due to their important role in the history of Jordan, Adyghe form the Hashemites&#x27; honour guard at the royal palaces. They represented Jordan in the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo in 2010, joining other honour guards such as the Airborne Ceremonial Unit.

=== Egypt ===

During the 13th century the Mamluks seized power in Cairo. Some 15th-century Circassian converts to Islam became Mamluks and rose through the ranks of the Mamluk dynasty to high positions, some becoming sultans in Egypt such as Qaitbay, Mamluk Sultan of Egypt (1468–1496). The majority of the leaders of the Burji Mamluk dynasty in Egypt (1382–1517) had Circassian origins, while also including Abkhaz, Abaza, and Georgian peoples whom the Arab sultans had recruited to serve their kingdoms as a military force. With the rise of Muhammad Ali Pasha (who ruled Egypt from 1805 to 1848), most senior Mamluks were killed by him in order to secure his rule and the remaining Mamluks fled to Sudan.
Most Circassian communities in Egypt were assimilated into the local population. several thousand Adyghe reside in Egypt; in addition to the descendants of Burji Mamluks of Adyghe origin, there are many who descend from royal Circassian consorts or Ottoman pashas of Circassian origin as well as Circassian muhajirs of the 19th century.

The biggest Circassian clan in Egypt is the Abaza family, the country&#x27;s largest aristocratic family which settled in the Nile Delta in the 18th century. It gained prominence under the Muhammad Ali dynasty and maintained it in the contemporary republican period.

=== Iraq ===

Adyghe came to Iraq directly from Circassia. They settled in all parts of Iraq—from north to south—but most of all in Iraq&#x27;s capital Baghdad. Many Adyghe also settled in Kerkuk, Diyala, Fallujah, and other places. Circassians have played major roles in different periods throughout Iraq&#x27;s history, and made great contributions to political and military institutions in the country, to the Iraqi Army in particular. Several Iraqi prime ministers have been of Circassian descent.

=== Iran ===
Iran has a significant Circassian population. It once had a very large community, but the vast majority were assimilated in the population in the course of centuries. The Safavid (1501–1736) and Qajar (1789–1925) dynasties saw the importing and deporting of large numbers of Circassians to Persia, where many enjoyed prestige in the harems and in the élite armies (the so-called &quot;ghulams&quot;), while many others settled and deployed as craftsmen, labourers, farmers and regular soldiers. Many members of the Safavid nobility and élite had Circassian ancestry and Circassian dignitaries, such as the kings Abbas II of Persia (reigned 1642–1666) and Suleiman I of Persia (reigned 1666–1694). While traces of Circassian settlements in Iran have lasted into the 20th century, many of the once large Circassian minority became assimilated into the local population.

However, significant communities of Circassians continue to live in particular cities in Iran, like Tabriz and Tehran, and in the northern provinces of Gilan and Mazandaran.

Notable places of traditional Circassian settlement in Iran include Gilan province, Fars province, Isfahan, and Tehran (due to contemporary migration). Circassians in Iran are the nation&#x27;s second largest Caucasus-derived nation after the Georgians.

===Rest of Western Asia===
Significant communities live in Jordan, Syria (see Circassians in Syria), and smaller communities live in Israel (in the villages of Kfar Kama and Rehaniya—see Circassians in Israel). Circassians are also present in Iraq. Baghdad, Sulaymaniyah, and Diyala comprise the country&#x27;s main cities with Circassians, though lesser numbers are spread in other regions and cities as well.

===Rest of Europe===

Out of 1,010 Circassians living in Ukraine (473 Kabardian Adyghe (Kabardin), 338 Adygean Adyghe, and 190 Cherkessian Adyghe (Cherkess)—after the existing Soviet division of Circassians into three groups), only 181 (17.9%) declared fluency in the native language; 96 (9.5%) declared Ukrainian as their native language, and 697 (69%) marked &quot;other language&quot; as being their native language. The major Adyghe community in Ukraine is in Odesa.

There is a small community of Circassians in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina (where the surname &quot;Čerkez&quot; exists) and North Macedonia. A number of Adyghe also settled in modern Bulgaria and in Northern Dobruja, which now belongs to Romania (see Circassians in Romania, in 1864–1865, but most fled after those areas became separated from the Ottoman Empire in 1878. The small part of the community that settled in Kosovo (the Kosovo Adyghes) moved to the Republic of Adygea in 1998, after the reprisals of the Serbian occupation forces became heavily intensified. The majority of the community, however, remained in Kosovo where they have been well established and integrated into Kosovan society. Many members of this community can be identified as they carry the family name &quot;Çerkezi&quot;, or &quot;Qerkezi&quot;. This community is also well established in the Republic of North Macedonia, usually mingling with the Albanian Muslim population.
Circassians can be found also in Albania but totally assimilated. The surname &quot;Çerkezi&quot; or &quot;Çekrezi&quot; is carried by this families.

There are Circassians in Germany and a small number in the Netherlands.

===North America===
Numerous Circassians have also immigrated to the United States and settled in Upstate New York, California, and New Jersey. There is also a small Circassian community in Canada.

==Sochi Olympics controversy==

The 2014 Winter Olympics facilities in Sochi (once the Circassian capital) were built in areas that were claimed to contain mass graves of Circassians who were killed during genocide by Russia in military campaigns lasting from 1860 to 1864.

Adyghe organizations in Russia and the Adyghe diaspora around the world requested that construction at the site stop and that the Olympic Games not be held at the site of the Adyghe genocide, to prevent desecration of Adyghe graves. According to Iyad Youghar, who headed the lobby group International Circassian Council: &quot;We want the athletes to know that if they compete here they will be skiing on the bones of our relatives.&quot; The year 2014 also marked the 150th anniversary of the Circassian Genocide which angered the Circassians around the world. Many protests were held all over the world to stop the Sochi Olympics, but were not successful.

<text>Michelle Malkin (; Maglalang; born October 20, 1970) is an American conservative political commentator. She was a Fox News contributor and in May 2020 joined Newsmax TV. Malkin has written seven books and founded the conservative commentary website Twitchy and the conservative blog &quot;Hot Air&quot;.

Around 2019, Malkin began to distance herself from conventional conservatism and instead publicly support members of the extreme right, including Nick Fuentes, as well as other white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and Groypers, including Identity Evropa leader Patrick Casey. In November 2019, she was dropped by conservative organization Young America&#x27;s Foundation (YAF), citing her support for individuals associated with antisemitism and white nationalism.

==Early life==
Michelle Malkin was born October 20, 1970, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, to Philippine citizens Rafaela (née Perez), a teacher, and Apolo DeCastro Maglalang, who was then a physician-in-training. Several months prior to Malkin&#x27;s birth, her parents immigrated to the United States on an employer-sponsored visa. After her father finished his medical training, the family moved to Absecon, New Jersey. She has described her parents as Ronald Reagan Republicans who were &quot;not incredibly politically active&quot;.

Malkin, a Roman Catholic, attended Holy Spirit High School, where she edited the school newspaper and aspired to become a concert pianist. Following her graduation in 1988, she enrolled at Oberlin College. Malkin had planned to pursue a bachelor&#x27;s degree in music, but changed her major to English. During her college years, she worked as a press inserter, tax preparation aide, and network news librarian. At Oberlin, she wrote for a conservative student newspaper started by Jesse Malkin, who later became her husband. Her first article for the paper heavily criticized Oberlin&#x27;s affirmative action program, and she said it received a &quot;huge[ly] negative response&quot; from other students on campus. She graduated in 1992 and later described her alma mater as &quot;radically left-wing&quot;.

==Career==
===Journalism===
Malkin began her journalism career at the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot;, working as a columnist from 1992 to 1994. In 1995, she worked in Washington, D.C. as a journalism fellow at the libertarian think tank Competitive Enterprise Institute. In 1996, she moved to Seattle, Washington, where she became a columnist for &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;. According to &quot;Goldsea&quot;, by the end of the year &quot;Malkin was unleashing the no-holds-barred style of political spitballing that would ultimately make her a poster girl for the radical right&quot;.

Since 1999, Malkin has written a syndicated column for Creators Syndicate. Her column is published by outlets including &quot;Townhall&quot;. Some publications which previously carried her column, such as &quot;The Daily Wire&quot; and &quot;National Review&quot;, stopped doing so around 2019 when she began to espouse more extreme views. The white supremacist publication &quot;American Renaissance&quot; began publishing her column in 2020.

On April 24, 2006, Malkin launched the conservative blog &quot;Hot Air&quot;, where she remained CEO until she sold the website in 2010. The site&#x27;s staff at launch included Allahpundit and Bryan Preston; Preston was later replaced by Ed Morrissey on February 25, 2008. In February 2010, Salem Communications bought &quot;Hot Air&quot; from Malkin. In March 2012, Malkin founded the website Twitchy, a Twitter content curation site. She sold Twitchy, also to Salem Communications, the following year.

For years, Malkin was a frequent commentator for Fox News and a regular guest host of &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;. In 2007, she announced that she would not return to &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, alleging that Fox News had mishandled a dispute over derogatory statements made about her by Geraldo Rivera in a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; interview. Malkin joined &quot;Conservative Review&#x27;s&quot; online television network, CRTV, when it launched in 2016, to host the documentary-style show &quot;Michelle Malkin Investigates.&quot; Malkin left CRTV under unclear circumstances when it merged with TheBlaze in December 2018. Malkin later joined competitor Newsmax TV in May 2020, where she began to host the show &quot;Sovereign Nation&quot;.
===Books===
Malkin published her first book, &quot;&quot;, in 2002. It reached #14 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list.

In 2004, she published &quot;In Defense of Internment: The Case for &#x27;Racial Profiling&#x27; in World War II and the War on Terror&quot;, defending the U.S. government&#x27;s internment of 112,000 Japanese Americans in prison camps during World War II, and arguing that racial profiling is acceptable in times of war. The book drew harsh criticism from mainstream scholars, organizations, and individuals including the Japanese American Citizens League and Fred Korematsu. The Historians&#x27; Committee for Fairness, an organization of scholars and professional researchers, published an open letter condemning the book for not having undergone peer review and arguing that its central thesis is false. Some conservative scholars spoke out in support of the book, including Thomas Sowell and Daniel Pipes. &quot;The Virginian-Pilot&quot; called her &quot;an Asian Ann Coulter&quot; and dropped her column in November 2004. Eric L. Muller also published a critique of &quot;In Defense of Internment&quot;.

Malkin&#x27;s third book, &quot;Unhinged: Exposing Liberals Gone Wild&quot;, was released in October 2005. Malkin released her fourth book, &quot;Culture of Corruption: Obama and His Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks, and Cronies&quot;, in July 2009. It remained on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Non-Fiction, Hardcover Best Seller list for six weeks. Her fifth book, &quot;Who Built That: Awe-Inspiring Stories of American Tinkerpreneurs&quot;, was released in May 2015 and was a response to the &quot;you didn&#x27;t build that&quot; statement made by President Barack Obama three years earlier, on July 13, 2012. Malkin published &quot;Sold Out: How High-Tech Billionaires &amp; Bipartisan Beltway Crapweasels Are Screwing America&#x27;s Best &amp; Brightest Workers&quot; in 2015 along with John Miano. She published &quot;Open Borders Inc.: Who&#x27;s Funding America&#x27;s Destruction?&quot; in 2019.

===Blogging===
In June 2004, Malkin launched a political blog, MichelleMalkin.com. A 2007 memo from the National Republican Senatorial Committee described Malkin as one of the five &quot;best-read national conservative bloggers&quot;. In December 2008, Malkin&#x27;s blog was the largest conservative blog, and in 2011, the people search company PeekYou reported that Malkin had the largest digital footprint of any political blogger. In April 2020, Malkin moved her blog and its archives to &quot;The Unz Review&quot;, a far-right website run by former publisher of &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, Ron Unz. According to the Anti-Defamation League, &quot;The Unz Review&quot; is &quot;a site that features numerous white supremacists and antisemites and is run by Ron Unz, who has written a number of antisemitic tracts.&quot;

Malkin has also been a contributor to the far-right anti-immigration website VDARE, writing a weekly column since 2002.

====Jamil Hussein====

In late 2006 and early 2007, Malkin was a leading voice among several right-wing bloggers who questioned both the credibility and the existence of Iraqi police captain Jamil Hussein, who had been used as a source by the Associated Press in over 60 stories about the Iraq war. The controversy began in November 2006 when the AP reported that six Iraqis had been burned alive as they left a mosque and that four mosques had been destroyed, citing Hussein as one of its sources. The Iraqi Ministry of the Interior and the United States military initially denied Hussein existed, leading Malkin and others to dispute the AP&#x27;s reporting.

In January 2007 the AP reported that the Ministry had acknowledged Hussein&#x27;s existence, and that authorities were seeking his arrest for having spoken to the press. Malkin reported the Iraqi government&#x27;s confirmation. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Malkin also &quot;expressed regret&quot;, though media scholar Arthur S. Hayes wrote in his 2008 book &quot;Press Critics are the Fifth Estate&quot; that her post &quot;contains no apology or words of regret from her&quot;.

=== Speaking ===

For 17 years, Malkin was a featured speaker for Young America&#x27;s Foundation (YAF). On November 14, 2019, during a YAF-sponsored speech at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Malkin praised white nationalist political commentator Nick Fuentes. In the same speech, she spoke supportively of the Proud Boys, Laura Loomer, and former Iowa Republican Representative Steve King. YAF cut ties with Malkin on November 18, saying, &quot;there is no room in mainstream conservatism or at YAF for holocaust deniers, white nationalists, street brawlers, or racists&quot;. Organizers at Bentley University also canceled a scheduled book promotion event after the incident.

Malkin has spoken at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). She was a featured speaker in 2019, and her anti-immigration speech, in which she condemned the &quot;ghost&quot; of John McCain, drew controversy. In 2020, Malkin spoke at the America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC), an event organized by Nick Fuentes that was described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as the &quot;right-wing extremist answer to CPAC&quot;. She also received press credentials to attend CPAC 2020, but did not speak at the conference. She spoke again at AFPAC 2021.

==Views==
Until 2019, Malkin was generally described as a conservative. Beginning in 2019, some publications began to describe her as right-wing, while some continue to describe her as conservative. She has been described as far-right by &quot;HuffPost&quot; in 2019, and &quot;Business Insider, Vanity Fair&quot;, and the &quot;Washingtonian&quot; in 2020. She has been described as alt-right by &quot;The Bulwark&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2020.

===Daniel Holtzclaw===

Malkin has written about Daniel Holtzclaw, a former Oklahoma City Police Department patrol officer who was convicted in December 2015 of multiple counts of rape, sexual battery, forcible oral sodomy, and other sexual charges. She has repeatedly argued that she believes Holtzclaw is innocent, saying that the forensic evidence backs his version of events, not the accusers&#x27; versions, and also that the investigators chose not to perform several tests she characterized as routine. Malkin debuted her first and second episodes of CRTV.com&#x27;s &quot;Daniel in the Den&quot; on December 12, 2016, in Enid. Malkin released her film about the case, entitled &quot;Railroaded: Surviving Wrongful Convictions&quot; in 2017.

===Immigration===
Malkin supports stricter immigration laws in the United States. She was a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2019, where she said levels of immigration into the United States amount to an &quot;invasion&quot; and &quot;endanger our general welfare and the blessings of liberty&quot;. She also condemned politicians, including the &quot;ghost&quot; of recently deceased Senator John McCain, for failing to enact stricter immigration regulation.

In a 2002 appearance on &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;, Malkin called for militarization of the Canadian border, comparing Canada to conflict zones where United States troops were deployed and saying, &quot;Canada bears a lot of responsibility for making us as vulnerable as we are to terrorism&quot;.

In 2017, Malkin endorsed alt-right candidate Paul Nehlen in his ultimately unsuccessful primary challenge against Paul Ryan for Wisconsin&#x27;s 1st congressional district, citing Nehlen&#x27;s opposition to &quot;elites&quot; who support open borders as the reason for her endorsement.

=== Muslims ===
Malkin has advocated for interning Muslims on national security grounds.

===Support for white nationalists===

Amanda Carpenter wrote in March 2020 that Malkin had begun to &quot;link arms with the most vocal elements of the white nationalist movement&quot;. In August 2020, the Anti-Defamation League wrote, &quot;in the past year ... she has publicly and explicitly allied herself with white supremacists&quot; and that she herself was &quot;echoing&quot; white supremacist views. The Southern Poverty Law Center described her in January 2021 as a &quot;former conservative-pundit-gone-white-nationalist-apologist&quot;.

YAF dismissed Malkin in November 2019 after she gave a YAF-sponsored speech at UCLA titled &quot;America First: the Torch Is Being Passed&quot;. In her speech, she praised Nick Fuentes as &quot;one of the New Right leaders&quot;, and also spoke supportively of the Proud Boys, Laura Loomer, and Steve King. In 2020, Malkin faced criticism for speaking at the America First Political Action Conference, which is hosted by white nationalist Nick Fuentes and also featured Patrick Casey, the founder of the neo-Nazi group Identity Evropa. She has described herself as the &quot;mommy&quot; of the Groypers, a loose collection of white nationalists who follow Nick Fuentes.

In 2020, Malkin appeared on &quot;Red Ice&quot;, a white supremacist radio program, and cautioned listeners about changing demographics and &quot;multicultural rot&quot;.

In November 2021, Malkin delivered a speech at the annual American Renaissance Conference, hosted by the white nationalist New Century Foundation. Malkin and her family were subsequently banned from using Airbnb in reaction to her having appeared at the event.

=== Accusations of antisemitism ===
According to &quot;Bridge Initiative&quot;, a Georgetown University research project on Islamophobia, In 2019, Malkin joined far-right commentator Gavin McInnes for a Facebook Live event to promote her book, and agreed with him when he claimed that Soros was &quot;not a Holocaust survivor&quot; but a &quot;Holocaust facilitator&quot;: Malkin has denied accusations of anti-semitism, saying that she is &quot;the proud wife of a grandson of Ukrainian Jews who came to this country to escape pogroms [and is] a proud supporter of Israel, but more importantly, a proud supporter of American sovereignty.&quot; At the 2020 America First Political Action Conference, Malkin said it was &quot;not anti-semitic&quot; to question &quot;whatever the precise number of people is who perished in World War II.&quot;

=== 2020 United States presidential election ===

Following the 2020 United States presidential election, Malkin helped advance the conspiracy theory that the election was stolen from Trump. She used the #StopTheSteal hashtag on Twitter and spoke at a Stop the Steal rally in her hometown of Colorado Springs to protest the election results. She also appeared in a trailer for a film about the movement, which also featured Fuentes and Stop the Steal organizer Ali Alexander.

==Personal life==
While in college at Oberlin, she began dating Jesse Malkin. They married in 1993 and have two children. Jesse Malkin worked as a healthcare consultant for RAND Corporation. Jesse is a retired health economist, who now works on his wife&#x27;s speaking engagements and helps her run her business.

Malkin and her family lived in North Bethesda, Maryland, until 2008 when they relocated to Colorado Springs, Colorado.

<text>The Southwest Mountains of Virginia are a mountain range centered on Charlottesville, parallel to and geologically associated with the Blue Ridge Mountains, which lie about 30 miles (50 km) to the west. The range is breached by the Rivanna River between Monticello and Pantops Mountain. Some of the more prominent peaks include Carters Mountain, Fan Mountain, Brush Mountain, Peters Mountain, Walton&#x27;s Mountain, and Hightop Mountain.

==Geography==
The Southwest Mountains are not particularly large, the highest point barely reaching 1,800 feet. They are one of the easternmost ranges in Virginia (along with the geologically associated Bull Run Mountains and Catoctin Mountain) and the viewshed for the Blue Ridge Mountains through Nelson and Albemarle Counties. 

The range bisects Nelson, Albemarle, and Orange counties. A portion of the Southwest Mountains in Albemarle County has been designated a Rural Historic District by the National Park Service, though none of the range is designated as state or national parkland. 

==Geology==
The Southwest Mountains are underlain by a belt of Catoctin greenstone, which forms the eastern edge of the Blue Ridge anticlinorium. The Catoctin Greenstone belt extends north into Maryland and also supports the Bull Run and Catoctin Mountains. The basalt flows which were metamorphosed to greenstone were deposited during the latest Precambrian age and first uplifted during Grenville Orogeny then again during the Alleghenian Orogeny, in which they were also transported westward to their present location. 

The mountains are part of EPA ecoregion 64c, the Northern Piedmont Uplands, and are typically defined by Appalachian oak forests, composed primarily of oaks and hickories. The Catoctin greenstone leads to a mafic or basic soil composition with a relatively high PH, corresponding to &quot;more fertile soils weathered from metabasalt, [where] Basic Oak-Hickory Forests form the forest matrix. In contrast to Oak/Heath Forests, these communities are relatively species-rich, with patchy but diverse herb layers and very few heath shrubs. Instead, small trees such as redbud and eastern hop hornbeam dominate the understory.&quot; 

==History and culture==
In its designation as a Virginia historical landmark, the Virginia Board of Historic Resources described the northern Albemarle portion of the Southwest Mountains as &quot;some of the Piedmont&#x27;s most pristine and scenic countryside.&quot; They went on:

Characterized by undulating pastures, winding roadways, forested hills, and small hamlets, the district contains a broad range of 18th-, 19th- and early 20th-century rural architecture, reflecting the evolving cultural patterns of more than 250 years of settlement.

The estates of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe are all located within the Southwest Mountains, as are many non-presidential estates, including Castle Hill. The ruins of Barboursville, a Jefferson-designed plantation home, are near the northern end of the range. 

Virginia Governor James Barbour, who lived in Orange County, wrote in 1835:

Let us, the inhabitants of the South-West Mountains, rejoice and be grateful that our benefits greatly preponderate over our ills. And so far as my testimony goes, resulting from actual observation of near one-third of the entire circumference of the earth, I feel no hesitation in declaring that I deem them the most desirable abode I have ever seen.

These mountains were at one time also referred to as the &quot;Chestnut Mountains.&quot; The plateaux of the Southwest Mountains in southern Albemarle and Nelson County were once referred to as the &quot;Green Mountains.&quot; The mountains today are mainly left forested, along with some housing, agriculture, and horse farms. There are several producers of wine and cider in and around the mountains, and Carters Mountain features an orchard and event space along its ridge. Mineral resources of soapstone and vermiculite continue to be mined at the southern end of the range.

<text>South Bermondsey railway station is on the South London line, serving the district of South Bermondsey in the London Borough of Southwark and managed and operated by Southern. It is down the line from ; the following station on the line is . The station is the principal stop for Millwall F.C.&#x27;s The Den.

==History==

The original station was situated to the north-west of South Bermondsey Junction, on the northern side of Rotherhithe New Road, very close to the now-closed Southwark Park railway station. It opened on 13 August 1866 with the South London Line, and was originally named &quot;Rotherhithe&quot;. On 1 December 1869 it was renamed &quot;South Bermondsey&quot;; Rotherhithe railway station less than a mile away opened six days later. 

The original station closed on 17 June 1928, when the present station, situated south of South Bermondsey Junction, took its place. The 1928 station is on an embankment, and its platforms and buildings are of wooden construction; the current passenger access to the station from Rotherhithe New Road and Ilderton Road is by a footpath partly constructed on the embankment previously occupied by the line to Bricklayers Arms and Willow Walk Goods Depots. In 1993, football club Millwall opened their ground The Den adjacent to the station. A direct footpath was built from the station to the North Stand (away section) of the ground, this is used on match days only.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 21 January 1947, an empty stock train was involved in a rear-end collision with an electric multiple unit.

==Services==
All services at South Bermondsey are operated by Southern using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to 
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via 

During the evenings (after approximately 20:00), the service between London Bridge and Beckenham Junction is reduced to hourly. This service does not run on Sundays.

<text>Needham Market is a small town in the Mid Suffolk district of Suffolk, England, set in the Gipping Valley. Nearby villages include Barking, Darmsden, Badley and Creeting St Mary. The town is located just east of the A14 trunk road, between Ipswich to the south and Stowmarket to the north; it is also sited on the Great Eastern Main Line, with the Needham Lake and the River Gipping being just east of the railway station. As of the 2021 United Kingdom census, the town had a population of 4,700 residents. The town of Needham, Massachusetts, was named after Needham Market.

==History==
The town grew initially around the wool combing industry, until the onset of the Bubonic plague, which swept the town from 1663 to 1665. To prevent the spread of the disease, the town was chained at either end, which succeeded in its task but at the cost of two-thirds of the populace. The town did not recover for nearly two hundred years, with the canalisation of the River Gipping in the late 18th century and the introduction of the railway. 

Modern Needham Market contains two road names that are linked to the plague: Chainhouse Road, named after the chains that ran across the east end of the town, and The Causeway, which is a modern variation of &quot;the corpseway&quot;; it is so called because of the route that plague victims were transported out of town, to neighbouring Barking church for interment.

Near the station, on land between the Rampant Horse pub and the river, is the Camping Land, with a name is derived from Campan or Campball, a rough and often rowdy medieval ball game and the predecessor of rugby football.

==Notable buildings==
Notable buildings in the town include:
* The 15th-century Church of St. John the Baptist, originally a chapel of ease for the parish of Barking (with a unique double-hammerbeam roof).
* The medieval Limes Hotel which dates back to around 1500.
* The Old Town Hall which was designed by the English architect, Frederick Barnes and completed in 1866.

== Climate ==

Like most of the UK, Ireland and much of France, Needham Market has an oceanic climate. This means that both the winter and summer temperatures are mild with not a huge difference between the winter and summer temperatures.

==Transport==
Needham Market railway station is sited on the Great Eastern Main Line, although there are no direct services between London or . Instead, there is an hourly service between and . It is a small unstaffed station; Greater Anglia manages it and operates the service.

The A14 (although then the A45) once ran directly through the town, but a bypass was built in the 1970s leaving the road now known as the B1113. This has left the town with good road links to the surrounding area, but with less traffic than before.

First Eastern Counties, a sub-brand of FirstGroup, operates the 88 route; this connects the town with Ipswich and Stowmarket every 30 minutes on weekdays.

==Sport and leisure==
Needham Market has a non-League football club, Needham Market F.C., which plays at Bloomfields. They have been successful over recent years after reaching the semi-finals of the 2010/2011 season&#x27;s FA Vase.

The town is on the route of the Dunwich Dynamo annual cycle ride, which takes place overnight. It is usually scheduled to take place on the Saturday night closest to the full moon in July.

Needham Lake provides leisure facilities and a wildlife habitat, which is located just east of the railway station. The lake is located on a nature reserve with the River Gipping running just east of it; it is popular with tourists. The lake was initially a gravel pit before being converted to a lake.

Other attractions in the town include the Alder Carr Farm, which makes and sells ice cream.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from either the Tacolneston or Sudbury TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Suffolk, Heart East, Nation Radio Suffolk, Greatest Hits Radio Ipswich &amp; Suffolk and Ipswich Community Radio, a community-based station.

The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;Ipswich Star&quot; and &quot;East Anglian Daily Times&quot;.

==Notable people==
Notable people from Needham Market include:
* Joseph Priestley (1733–1804), chemist, theologian and natural philosopher, was Needham&#x27;s parish priest from 1755–61 
* Dykes Alexander (1763–1849), Quaker businessman and minister.
* Samuel Herbert Maw (1881-1952), architect, delineator and cartographer whose career took place mostly in Canada
* June Brown (1927–2022), actress who played Dot Cotton in &quot;EastEnders&quot;
* Ros Scott (born 1957), Liberal Democrat peer, a former district and county councillor for the town, chose it for her title.

<text>Seán Fortune (20 December 1953 – 13 March 1999) was a Catholic priest from Ireland, and child molester, who allegedly used his position to gain access to his victims. He was accused of the rape and sexual molestation of 29 different boys. He committed suicide while awaiting trial.

==Life==
Born on 20 December 1953 in Gorey, County Wexford, Fortune was the eldest son of Elizabeth (née Acton) and James Fortune. He was educated at St Peter&#x27;s College, Wexford, which was the diocesan seminary of the diocese of Ferns. It was during his training that the first reports of his abuse were made, although it is not clear whether the Diocesan authorities had knowledge of these complaints before his ordination.

Fortune ministered in the village of Fethard-on-Sea in County Wexford, in Belfast and in Dundalk. Allegations of abuse were made against him in all three places. Fortune would take groups of boys to stay over in Loftus Hall in the early 1980s when it was a convent, and allegedly carried out some of his attacks there. Sean Cloney compiled a dossier of complaints against him. Fr. Fortune also set up a business in Dublin which offered media and journalism training to the public.

On 13 March 1999, he committed suicide in New Ross while awaiting trial for 66 charges of sexual abuse against 29 boys. He had taken a lethal cocktail of drugs and alcohol and was found dead in bed by his housekeeper. He was 45. He had been remanded in custody pending trial but had been released days earlier.

In March 2002, the BBC broadcast &quot;Suing the Pope&quot;, a documentary detailing the activities of Fortune and the response of the Diocese of Ferns to his activities over the years. The Report of the Ferns Inquiry claims that two of Fortune&#x27;s alleged victims have since died by suicide.

<doc id="517936" wikidata="Q1426707" url="?curid=517936" title="Fort George, Highland">
<text>Fort George is a large 18th-century fortress near Ardersier, to the north-east of Inverness in the Highland council area of Scotland. It was built to control the Scottish Highlands in the aftermath of the Jacobite rising of 1745, replacing a &quot;Fort George&quot; in Inverness constructed after the 1715 Jacobite rising to control the area. The current fortress has never been attacked and has remained in continuous use as a garrison.

The fortification is based on a star design; it remains virtually unaltered and nowadays is open to visitors with exhibits and facsimiles showing the fort&#x27;s use at different periods, while still serving as an army barracks.

==Old Fort George==
In 1726, the first fortification known as Fort George was completed in Inverness on the orders of General George Wade. The Georgian fort, which stood on a hillock beside the River Ness, incorporated portions of a medieval castle that had been started by Malcolm III of Scotland in the late 11th century. In the 17th century, Oliver Cromwell strengthened the castle with a citadel but it had been abandoned by the start of the 18th century. Wade&#x27;s Fort George was capable of housing 400 troops. The first commanding officer of the original Fort George was Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet, Colonel of the 42nd Royal Highlanders (Black Watch) and chief of the Highland Clan Munro.

During the 1745 rising the fort was besieged by three thousand Jacobites. Cutoff and unable to be relieved by Crown forces, Fort George was surrendered in February 1746 after mines had reached the outer walls. The victorious Jacobites blew up Old Fort George to prevent it being reused as a military base by the British Army. 

In 1747, following the Crown victory at the Battle of Culloden, Colonel William Skinner, the King&#x27;s Military Engineer for North Britain, was given a contract to rebuild Fort George. The decision was taken to build the new Fort George at a location away from Inverness at the mouth of the Moray Firth. The site of Old Fort George lay abandoned for almost 70 years, until in the mid 19th century a red sandstone castellated building called Inverness Castle was built on the fort&#x27;s former site. Despite its towers and battlements, Inverness Castle had no military purpose. It was used as a prison, and courthouse with complimentary bastioned enclosing walls.

==Siting and construction==
The site chosen was a level spit of land at Ardersier, about 11 miles (18 km) northeast of Inverness, which forms a promontory jutting into the Moray Firth and controls the sea approach to Inverness. With its own harbour below the walls, the fort could be supplied by sea in the event of a siege.

Work began in 1748, with Colonel Skinner in charge, and the Adam brothers, John, Robert and later James, acting as contractors, overseeing around 1,000 soldiers who provided labour and defended the site against attack. By 1757 the main defences were in place, and Fort George was finally completed in 1769. The original budget was £92,673 19s 1d, but the final cost was more than £200,000, a vast figure at the time.

==Fortifications==

The fortifications form an example of defence in depth. The main walls are stone-faced, in plan faceted and angled with projecting bastions and redoubts so that every wall face is covered by fire from guns sited on top of other walls. The walls are many yards wide and grassed over, on top of barrel-vaulted casemates which form underground bunkers designed to protect the entire garrison from artillery fire. The approach to the fortress from the landward side is across a wide area of loose shingle which creates a protective barrier.

Sloping grassy banks designed to absorb artillery shells all but hide the fort from view. The entrance is reached via a ravelin, a free-standing defensive structure incorporating a guardhouse and completely exposed to fire from the main fort, then by a raised wooden walkway, complete with drawbridge, bridging across a wide ditch set between heavily defended bastions. The ditch forms a wide killing ground openly exposed to gunfire from these walls. The overall effect has been described as &quot;a harmony of pure reason and serene menace&quot;.

==Operational use==
Following the Childers Reforms, the 72nd (Highland) Regiment of Foot and the 78th (Highlanders) Regiment of Foot amalgamated to form the Seaforth Highlanders with its depot in the barracks in 1881. In 1961 the regiment amalgamated with the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders to form the Queen&#x27;s Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons): the new regiment formed its depot at Fort George at that time. The barracks became the home of the Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland in 2007.

In November 2016 the Ministry of Defence announced that the site would close in 2032, with Defence Minister Sir Michael Fallon commenting that it was no longer needed because the Highland rebellions are over.

==Visitor access==
The barracks are still in use as a military establishment, but much of the site is open to the public (entrance charge). Historic Environment Scotland use part of one of the barracks to display reconstructions of life in the early days of the fort, and the Grand Magazine displays the Seafield Collection of Arms as well as forming a stage for actors recreating the lives and stories of soldiers in the 18th century. The site received 76,169 visitors during 2019.

===Highlanders&#x27; Museum (Queen&#x27;s Own Highlanders Collection)===

The former Lieutenant Governors’ House is home to the Highlanders&#x27; Museum, the official regimental museum of the Queen&#x27;s Own Highlanders and Lovat Scouts. The exhibits include uniforms, weapons, medals, First World War memorial plaques known as &quot;death pennies&quot;, photographs, paintings, memorabilia and regimental regalia. Displays include the history of the regiments, their links to the clans, the Highland charge, Sergeant Alexander Edwards and other notable regimental members, and the regiments&#x27; activities in different conflicts. The regimental Chapel is also open to visitors, and features many regimental colours and memorials.

<text>Lubumbashi ( , ; former ; former ) is the second-largest city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the country&#x27;s southeasternmost part, along the border with Zambia. The capital and principal city of the Haut-Katanga Province, Lubumbashi is the center of mining in the region, acting as a hub for many of the country&#x27;s largest mining companies. No definite population figures are available, but the population of the city&#x27;s urban area is estimated to be around 2,584,000 in 2021.

== History ==
===Élisabethville under Belgian rule===
The Belgian government established the modern-day government in the city of &quot;Élisabethville&quot; (sometimes Elizabethville, both in French, or Elisabethstad in Dutch) in 1910, named in honour of Queen Elisabeth, consort to King Albert I of the Belgians. By that time, the government had taken over the colony from King Leopold II, and renamed it as the Belgian Congo. This site was chosen by Vice-Governor-General Emile Wangermée because of its proximity to the copper mine of &quot;Etoile du Congo&quot; and the copper ore smelting oven installed by Union Minière du Haut Katanga on the nearby Lubumbashi River.

The &quot;Comité Spécial du Katanga&quot; (CSK), a semi-private concessionary company set up in 1900, had its headquarters in Élisabethville throughout the colonial era. It enjoyed major privileges, mainly in terms of land and mining concessions, in the Katanga province.

The city prospered with the development of a regional copper mining industry. Huge investments in the 1920s, both in the mining industry and in transport infrastructure (railline Elisabethville-Port Francqui and Elisabethville-Dilolo), developed the Katanga province into one of the world&#x27;s major copper ore producers. The population of the city grew apace from approx. 30,000 in 1930, to 50,000 in 1943 and 180,000 in 1957. It was the second city of the Belgian Congo, after Léopoldville.
As was customary with European colonies, the city centre of Élisabethville was reserved for the minority white (European) population. This consisted mainly of Belgian nationals, but the city also attracted important British and Italian communities, as well as Jewish Greeks. Congolese were allowed in the white city only during the day, except for the house servants (&quot;boys&quot;) who often lived in shanty dwellings (&quot;boyeries&quot;) located in the backyards of the European city houses.

Many men in the black population were labour immigrants from neighbouring regions in the Belgian Congo (Northern Katanga, Maniema, Kasaï), from Belgian Rwanda and Burundi, and from British Northern Rhodesia (present-day Zambia). The black population lived initially in a so-called &quot;cité indigène&quot; called &quot;Quartier Albert&quot; (now Kamalondo), south of the city centre and separated from the white city by a 700-metres-wide neutral zone. With population growth, new indigenous quarters were created. These still form the main suburbs of present-day Lubumbashi: Kenia, Katuba, and Ruashi. The work and businesses related to the mines made Élisabethville the most prosperous region of the Congo during the last decade of Belgian rule. In 1954, there were 8,000 black homeowners in the city while thousands more were skilled workers. It was estimated that black Africans living in Élisabethville had a higher standard of living than anywhere else on the continent at that time.
Miners in Élisabethville conducted a strike in December 1941 to protest the increasingly severe forced-labour regime that the Belgians imposed on the population because of the &quot;war efforts&quot;. A rally in the Union Minière football stadium got out of hand. Police opened fire and numerous protesters were killed. In early 1944, the city was again in the grip of severe tensions and fear of violent protests, following a mutiny of the Force Publique (army) in Luluabourg.

Starting in 1933, the Belgian colonial authorities experimented with a limited form of self-governance by establishing the cité indigène of Élisabethville as a so-called &quot;centre extra-coutumier&quot; (a centre not subject to customary law). It was administered by an indigenous council and presided over by an indigenous chief. But due to constant interference from the Belgian authorities, the experiment soon proved a failure. The first indigenous chief – Albert Kabongo – appointed in 1937, was dismissed in 1943 and not replaced.

In 1957, Élisabethville was established as a fully autonomous city; it held the first free municipal elections in which the Congolese could vote. The people of Élisabethville gave a vast majority to the nationalist Alliance des Bakongo, which demanded immediate independence from Belgium.

Élisabethville functioned as the administrative capital of the Katanga province. It was also an important commercial and industrial centre, and a centre of education and health services. The Benedictine Order and missionary Order of Salesians offered a wide range of educational facilities to Europeans and Congolese alike, including vocational training (Kafubu). The Belgians established the University of Élisabethville in 1954–1955 (now the University of Lubumbashi).
=== Lubumbashi from 1960 ===
Élisabethville served as the capital and centre of the secessionist independent state of Katanga during the 1960–1963 Congolese civil war. Moise Tshombe proclaimed Katangan independence in July 1960. Congolese leaders arrested him and charged him with treason in April 1961; however, he agreed to dismiss his foreign advisers and military forces in exchange for his release. Tshombe returned to Élisabethville but repudiated these assurances and began to fight anew. United Nations troops opposed Katangan forces and took control of the city in December 1961 under a strong mandate. Roger Trinquier, well known for his published works on counter-insurgency warfare, served as a French military advisor to President Tshombe until international pressure, led by Belgium, caused his recall to France.

Mobutu Sese Seko ultimately assumed power of the Congo, which he renamed Zaïre. He renamed Élisabethville as &quot;Lubumbashi&quot; in 1966 and in 1972 renamed Katanga as &quot;Shaba.&quot;

In May 1990, the university campus of Lubumbashi was the scene of a brutal killing of students by Mobutu&#x27;s security forces. In 1991–92 ethnic tensions between the Luba from Katanga and the Luba from Kasaï, resident in the city, led to violent confrontations and the forced removal from the city of the latter.

Congo entered another genocidal civil war in the late 1990s. The Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo rebels captured Lubumbashi in April 1997. Rebel leader Laurent-Désiré Kabila spoke from Lubumbashi to declare himself president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 17 May 1997 after Mobutu Sese Seko fled Kinshasa.

When Laurent-Désiré Kabila decided to appoint a transitional parliament, in 1999, he decided to install the Parliament in Lubumbashi, in order to consolidate the fragile unity of the country. The parliament was installed in the building of the National Assembly of secessionist Katanga (the former city theatre), which had its capital in this city as well, in the 1960s. Lubumbashi was therefore the Legislative capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1999 to 2003, when all the country&#x27;s central institutions were brought back to Kinshasa.

On 7 September 2010 a large prison break happened in Lubumbashi after gunmen attacked a prison on the outskirts of the city. 960 prisoners managed to escape, including the Mai-Mai leader Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga. On 23 March 2013 a militia group of 100 fighters attacked Lubumbashi and seized a United Nations compound, which was surrounded by Congolese soldiers and members of the president&#x27;s Republican Guard.

== Geography ==

Lubumbashi lies at around above sea level. The high altitude serves to cool the climate, which would otherwise be very hot. The Kafue River rises along the Zambian border near the city and meanders through north-central Zambia to the Zambezi River, cutting a long, deep panhandle into the country.

===Climate===
Lubumbashi has a dry-winter humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cwa&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification), with warm rainy summers and pleasant, dry winters, with most rainfall occurring during summer and early autumn. Annual average rainfall is 1,238 mm (48.75 inches).

== Demography ==
=== Languages ===
French is the official language, but the main spoken lingua franca in Lubumbashi is Kiswahili. The dialect of Kiswahili spoken all down the east side of Congo (including the provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu, Maniema, Katanga and Oriental, Western Kasai and Eastern Kasai) and almost all the way across to the Katangan border with Angola is called Kingwana. As many people have moved into Lubumbashi for employment from rural areas, they have brought many other local languages including Kiluba, Chokwe, Bemba and Kisanga. Kiswahili has been the chief language shared by most people.

=== Religious expression === 
Religious places of worship in Lubumbashi are predominantly Christian: Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lubumbashi (Catholic Church), Kimbanguist Church, Baptist Community of Congo (Baptist World Alliance), Baptist Community of the Congo River (Baptist World Alliance), Assemblies of God, Province of the Anglican Church of the Congo (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Community in Congo (World Communion of Reformed Churches). On April 5, 2020, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced plans to construct a temple in Lubumbashi, its second temple in the country. There are also Muslim mosques.

== Economy ==

Lubumbashi serves as an important commercial and national industrial centre. Manufactures include textiles, food products and beverages, printing, bricks, and copper smelting. The city is home to the Simba brewery, producing the famous Tembo beer.

The city hosts the headquarters of one of the country&#x27;s largest banks, Trust Merchant Bank. The area also has a daily newspaper.

===Mining===
Lubumbashi, the mining capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is a base for many of the country&#x27;s biggest mining companies. The Democratic Republic of Congo produces &quot;more than 3 percent of the world&#x27;s copper and half its cobalt, most of which comes from Katanga.&quot;

== Transport ==

The city serves as a distribution centre for such minerals as copper, cobalt, zinc, tin, and coal.

===Road===
The city is crossed by Transafrican Highway 9 (TAH 9), which connects it to the cities of Lusaka and Kolwezi.

===Rail===
Lubumbashi is the center of the railway lines from Cape to Cairo Railway, which serves as a link with the cities of Ilebo, Kindu, Tenke, Sakania and Ndola.

In Tenke, the city connects with Kolwezi and Lobito, through the Benguela railway.

===Air===
Lubumbashi is home to the modern Lubumbashi International Airport.

== Education ==
The largest institution of higher education is the University of Lubumbashi, founded in 1955, with also the teaching institutions Protestant University of Lubumbashi and the Graduate Institute of Health Sciences.

Multiple international schools are present in Lubumbashi, including a Belgian school (École Privée Belge de Lubumbashi), a French school (Établissement scolaire français Blaise-Pascal), and a British school (British International School of Lubumbashi).

== Urban infrastructure ==
===Parks===
Muyambo Kyasa popularized the concept of parks. Muyambo Park opened in 2010. Located about 15 km from Lubumbashi, it is a large garden where children can play games, and adults relax. Other parks (or farms) include Mikembo and Futuka (once a reserve, now closed) on Kasenga Road in the city&#x27;s outskirts.

===Zoo===
The zoo of Lubumbashi is one of the most visited tourist attractions. It was created during the colonial period, and is considered the most attractive zoo in the country. During the years of war, it deteriorated but it has been rehabilitated by AZLU, a non-profit organization. By 2007, great animals had been acquired for the zoo. AZLU is keeping the zoo &quot;for education purposes, and the protection of the natural heritage of the country,&quot; as it can be read on signs. Today, it has almost been restocked with lions, tigers, monkeys, apes, pelicans, wart hogs, crocodiles, snakes, turtles, monitor lizards, eagles, parrots, ostriches, gazelles, etc. Apart from animals, the zoo features a restaurant, a veterinary center, and a termite museum.

== Culture ==

Attractions in the city include a botanical garden, a zoo, and the regional archaeological and ethnological National Museum of Lubumbashi. Every two years, the Biennale of Lubumbashi is held across the city, showcasing works by artists from the region. In an interview in Ocula Magazine in 2019, the Biennale&#x27;s artistic director, Sandrine Colard explained, &#x27;The Congo is a country that is perpetually in the future. All of these different periods coalescing in one city is something I wanted to address.&#x27;

===Art===
Bogumił Jewsiewicki says that contemporary Lubumbashi art making is weak, especially when compared to the Kinshasan. He writes,
&quot;No Lubumbashi popular painter has had an international career like that of the Kinshasa artist Chéri Samba, and there are in fact a number of artists and musicians in Kinshasa whom the whirlwind of international success has whisked farther from local audiences than any artist in Lubumbashi, and not only in Lubumbashi but in the surrounding province of Katanga.&quot;He names painters like Pilipili, Mwenze, Angali, Nkulu wa Nkulu, Maka, Tshimbumba, Dekab, and others.

===Cinema===
Ciné Bétamax, formerly &quot;Ciné Palace&quot; and &quot;Ciné Eden&quot;, are the only modern movie theaters in the city which generally show popular recent Hollywood productions as well as NC-17 films. However, they also show movies about Congolese and African recent history like &quot;Mister Bob,&quot; &quot;,&quot; &quot;SEAL Team 8: Behind Enemy Lines,&quot; and &quot;Tears of the Sun.&quot; Before films, they both showed Congolese and international music videos, and US wrestling. The communication department of the University of Lubumbashi has collaborated with the movie theater to show students’ films.

Ciné Bétamax in particular also screens great football matches, and local singers’ concerts and Christian meetings are regularly held here. 

Nigeria&#x27;s Nollywood films are also, as in many other parts of the DRC and Africa, popular among the residents. These films are often sold on VCD and DVD platforms.

===Music===
The popular music from Kinshasa is much appreciated and played in Lubumbashi. Jean-Bosco Mwenda is likely the most famous Katangese musician. Many of his songs have become classical, and are endlessly remixed by new young artists. Modern Lubumbashi singers fall into two groups: those who play Soukous, such as Jo Kizi and Képi Prince, and those who play international urban music, such as Ced Koncept, Tshumani, M-Joe, RJ Kanierra, Oxygène, Agresivo, Nelson Tshi, and Da Costa on the other. Most artists are influenced by successful Dj Spilulu&#x27;s productions, Kinshasa singers Fally Ipupa, Ferré Gola and World Music.

Lubumbashi music is characterized by the use of many languages (Swahili, Lingala, Tshiluba, French and some English) in the lyrics. It is rare to hear songs composed in only one language. This code switching and mixing expresses the cosmopolitan character of the city, but some critics think it weakens the lyrics, which seem to be particularly made for teenagers anyway. Serge Manseba and Karibyona are humorist-singers featured by G&#x27;Sparks.

===French cultural influence===
The Institut Français (formally known as ), located in the heart of the city, contributes a great deal to the cultural and artistic life of Lubumbashi. Students and researchers spend time in its library; it shows European and other French-language films; produces plays and other shows in its theater; and features local singers’ records for sale on display at the entrance.

===Radio Okapi&#x27;s cultural participation===
Radio Okapi&#x27;s Lubumbashi presenters participate each Saturday evening in &quot;Métissage&quot;, the cultural program of the radio. The whole country is informed of the cultural activities in the city.

== Media ==
===National channel (RTNC/Katanga)===
RTNC (Congolese National Radio and Television) has a provincial station located in Lubumbashi district at the junction of Lubilanshi and Sandoa. It has been very influential from the 1960s to the mid-1990s, at the end of the one-party system, and before the information technology revolution.

===Independent channels===
Zenith Radio, the first independent radio station in the city, started broadcasting in 1996; since then numerous radio and television stations have been established. They can be classified in three groups: religious channels (Zenith, RTIV, Canal de Vie, RNS, etc.), commercial channels (RTA, Mwangaza, Nyota, RTLJ, Malaïka, Kyondo, etc.), and mixed ones like Wantanshi Radio and Television.

== Sports ==
===Football===
Football is the most popular sport in Lubumbashi. The city is home to football clubs of the top national level such as FC Saint Eloi Lupopo, CS Don Bosco and TP Mazembe. TP Mazembe is the most successful club in national competitions and the most successful Congolese club in international football achieving 5 Africa&#x27;s Champions League and reaching a FIFA Club World Cup final. The Chairman of Mazembe is the former governor of the province of Katanga Moïse Katumbi Chapwe.

Until 1960, Congolese football was segregated between whites-only and blacks-only leagues and competitions. In 1911 the whites-only Ligue de Football du Katanga was founded in Elisabethville, organising in 1925 the first official local championship called the B. Smith Cup. The Katanga tournament was won by teams from Lubumbashi every recorded season except 2005. Simultaneously three blacks-only regional tournaments were played in the country. In 1950, the &#x27;black&#x27; Elisabethville Football Association (FASI, Fédérations et Associations Sportives Indigènes) had over 30 affiliated clubs competing in four leagues divided over 3 divisions.

Both black and white tournaments in Lubumbashi and the country were played simultaneously until 1960, when they were unified. Since then the traditionally black clubs have dominated both local and national football.

The &#x27;black&#x27; Ligue de Football du Elisabethville, now renamed the Ligue de Football du Lubumbashi, is the city&#x27;s football tournament, organized since 1960 by the city&#x27;s federation EFLU. FC Saint-Eloi Lupopo won the EFLU league 25 times in all up to 2003 being the most successful club in the seasons for which records are known (some are not known).

===Basketball===
Basketball players Myck Kabongo and Bismack Biyombo are from Lubumbashi. Oscar Tshiebwe, the consensus 2022 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s player of the year at the University of Kentucky, is also from Lubumbashi.

<doc id="517946" wikidata="Q2097392" url="?curid=517946" title="Newbiggin-by-the-Sea">
<text>Newbiggin-by-the-Sea is a seaside town and civil parish in Northumberland, England, located on the North Sea coast.

The town is a fishing port and formerly a part of a trade route for shipping grain. Newbiggin Colliery operated from 1908 until 1967.

Newbiggin became a popular beach resort by 1828 and remains a tourist attraction with landmarks such as the &quot;Couple&quot; sculpture by Sean Henry, and the 13th-century parish church. The town council oversees governance while the economy remains diverse with 89 active companies as of this date. Newbiggin was part of the Wansbeck local government district until 2009, and lies within the Wansbeck UK Parliamentary constituency, represented by Ian Lavery MP since 2010. The town holds an annual music festival that raises money for charity and is also home to several religious sites representing various denominations.

== Toponymy ==
Newbiggin derives its name from the Old English &quot;nīwe&quot; (new) + Middle English &quot;bigging&quot; (building, house), and may refer to an extension of the early settlement and parish of Woodhorn. Historically the name has been spelt as &quot;Newbiggen&quot; and &quot;Newbigging&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The church was for centuries a chapel only, with a tower surmounted by a spire which was originally used as a beacon. In the 14th century, Newbiggin was a very important maritime centre, called upon to support Edward III in his campaigns against the Scots. In the Middle Ages, Newbiggin was a major port for the shipping of grain, third in importance after London and Hull. Henry III granted a charter for a weekly market on Monday and an annual fair; in 1337, as a borough of note, it sent bailiffs to a council on matters of state, convened by the Bishop of Lincoln, the Earl of Warwick and other noblemen.

=== 1800 – present ===
In 1805, two boats, with nineteen men, were lost in a storm off Newbiggin, after which £1,700 was donated by fundraising in the Newcastle region to relieve the bereaved families. As early as 1828, Newbiggin was a popular beach resort, with facilities to cater for visitors. The town had five public houses, one of which had a spa-like array of bathing facilities, several shops and lodging houses. The village featured a shore with a beach about a mile in length, well suited for bathing. By 1848 it was established as a resort in warmer seasons. Several guesthouses took hold. The bay gave good anchorage for small vessels, but even then was very little used, except for the numerous boats belonging to the fishery, in which most of the inhabitants were employed. Pilchard, herring, cod, haddock, whiting, ling, halibut, turbot, sole, and skate were caught by the fishermen of Newbiggin and sold primarily at Newcastle. Salmon, trout, lobsters and crabs were also caught, not only for the supply of the neighbouring markets but the region.

== Governance ==
Newbiggin-by-the-Sea has a town council.

Under the Local Government Act 1972 Newbiggin-by-the-Sea became part of the local government district of Wansbeck in 1974. The local government district was abolished in 2009, with its responsibilities transferred to the Northumberland County Council unitary authority.

Newbiggin-by-the-Sea is in the UK Parliamentary constituency of Blyth and Ashington which, since the 2024 general election, has been represented at Westminster by Ian Lavery MP. 

The former local government district of Wansbeck and the Parliamentary constituency of Wansbeck both derive their names from the River Wansbeck which flows into the North Sea near Newbiggin-by-the-Sea.

== Economy ==
Fishing has always been associated with Newbiggin, although later many inhabitants were employed in coal mining. By the Victorian era, Newbiggin was Northumberland&#x27;s favourite seaside town, attracting hundreds of visitors every day in the summer months.

In 1869, there were 142 cobles (fishing boats) in Newbiggin-by-the-Sea.

Newbiggin Colliery was sunk in 1908. The colliery closed in 1967, but at its peak in 1940, 1,400 men were employed there. The former Newbiggin Colliery Band is now the Jayess Newbiggin Brass Band, named for its president and former member, cornet legend James Shepherd.

To date, there are 89 active companies based in Newbiggin.

== Landmarks ==
The town was at the end of the first telegraph cable from Scandinavia in 1868, and was laid from Jutland, Denmark. Attractions in Newbiggin today include the 13th-century parish church, and the flagship Newbiggin Maritime Centre, which has replaced the former heritage centre at a cost of £3 million.

The lifeboat station was opened in 1851 following a fishing disaster in which ten Newbiggin fishermen lost their lives in stormy seas. It is the oldest operational boathouse in the British Isles. Celebrating over 160 years as a lifeboat station, Newbiggin has had 13 different station lifeboats over the years; today it operates an inshore Atlantic 85 lifeboat. The crews have been presented with 16 awards for gallantry.

A £10 million renovation to rebuild and improve Newbiggin&#x27;s rapidly eroding beach involved importing 500,000 tonnes of sand from Skegness, delivered by the trailing suction hopper dredger (TSHD) &quot;Oranje&quot; and deposited on the beach through a pipe approximately in diameter. A new offshore breakwater was installed to accompany the matching breakwater on the opposite side of the bay. Also installed is a brass statue by sculptor Sean Henry named Couple, anchored in the centre of the bay.

Newbiggin-by-the-Sea boasts the longest promenade in Northumberland. Each spring and autumn, the promenade becomes a prime location for naturalists watching the North Sea seabird migratory passage.

== Religious sites ==
The 13th century Parish Church of St Bartholomew, bleakly situated against a North Sea backdrop at Church Point, contains a notable collection of medieval gravestones. Eight complete cross slab grave covers have been reset in the walls of the north aisle which was rebuilt in 1912. The chancel, the east and western bays of arcades and the west tower are all 13th century, while the spire dates to the 14th century.

Woodhorn Church was once the mother church in the Parish of Woodhorn with Newbiggin. When she was declared redundant in 1973, that role passed to St Bartholomew&#x27;s.

The Salvation Army has had a presence in Newbiggin-by-the-Sea since 1902 and its current premises consist of a worship hall on Front Street, opened in 1939, and a community hall on Vernon Place. The Salvation Army band features in the recollections of those who have grown up in Newbiggin or spent summer holidays there. Mary Heynes, who in her childhood was once head girl at the former West Junior School in Newbiggin, recalls that in the 1960s, &quot;The Salvation Army would be on the Quay wall every Sunday doing a service and the band would play.&quot; In 1991 the Newbiggin-by-the-Sea Salvation Army Songster Brigade (the choir) recorded songs for BBC Radio.

St Mark&#x27;s Church on Gibson Street was built in 1868 by the local stonemason William Gibson. Once a busy Presbyterian church, after the 1972 union of the Presbyterian and Congregational denominations in England St Mark&#x27;s became a United Reformed church. St Mark&#x27;s has now closed to worship. St Andrew&#x27;s Methodist Chapel on Front Street was built in 1876. In 2010, the United Reformed and Methodist congregations in Newbiggin combined to form a single congregation in the South East Northumberland Ecumenical Area, meeting at St Andrew&#x27;s which is now known as St Andrew&#x27;s and St Mark&#x27;s (Methodist/United Reformed) Church.

Prior to the building of St Andrew&#x27;s in 1876, the Methodists used to meet in the Wesleyan Chapel on Robinson Square, which was built in 1844. In the early 20th century, the Robinson Square building was used by the Salvation Army before the Salvation Army acquired its current premises.

The Apostolic Church, whose beginnings can be traced to South Wales during the 1904-05 Welsh Revival, arrived in Newbiggin in 1936, initially hiring a room above the Co-operative store which still stands on Cleveland Terrace. Subsequently, the Apostolic Church acquired a building at 15–17 Gibson Street, but this closed to worship in 2010 and now houses the Newbiggin Boxing Club gym. After a long association with Newbiggin-by-the-Sea (Mary Heynes, former head girl of the West Junior School, reports that her father was an Apostolic preacher in the 1960s), the Apostolic Church now has no congregation in the town.

St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, a small building on Front Street, is part of the Parish of St Aidan&#x27;s in Ashington.

== Summer fair ==
Until 2004 Newbiggin was host to a street fair that attracted thousands of people every year. In its final years, the fair was set out in the following format: starting at the beginning of the shopping area of Front Street, up to the Cresswell Arms public house flowing into Church Point car park and continuing along the seafront promenade. The lifeboat house and boatyard became the music venue. A stage replaced the boats and the lifeboat house opened its doors, serving food and afternoon tea. Appearances were made by Slade, Leo Sayer and TV show &quot;Gladiators&quot; star Michael Van Wijk.

Starting in 2010, the annual Old Ship Music Festival is attempting to bring back a summer event to the village. It invites bands from the region and worldwide to play, as well as local comedians, and raises money for charity with the help of local businesses. In 2010 it raised £700 for Help for Heroes, where in 2011, the chosen charity was the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, and raised £1,100.

<text>Brown sugar is a sucrose sugar product with a distinctive brown color due to the presence of molasses. It is by tradition an unrefined or partially refined soft sugar consisting of sugar crystals with some residual molasses content (natural brown sugar), but is now often produced by the addition of molasses to refined white sugar (commercial brown sugar).

== Characteristics ==
The &quot;Codex Alimentarius&quot; requires brown sugar to contain at least 88% sucrose plus invert sugar. Commercial brown sugar contains from 3.5% molasses (light brown sugar) to 6.5% molasses (dark brown sugar) based on its total volume. Based on total weight, regular commercial brown sugar contains up to 10% molasses. Brown sugars are graded numerically according to how dark they are, with higher numbers correlating with darker sugars. The most common gradings are 6, 8, 10 and 13. The product is naturally moist from the hygroscopic nature of the molasses and is often labeled &quot;soft.&quot; The product may undergo processing to make it flow better for industrial handling. The addition of dyes or other chemicals may be permitted in some areas or for industrial products.

Particle size is variable but generally smaller than that of granulated white sugar. Products for industrial use (e.g., the industrial production of cakes) may be based on caster sugar, which has crystals of approximately 0.35 mm.

==History==
=== From a type of raw sugar to a consumer product ===
The meaning of the term &#x27;brown sugar&#x27; has changed over time. In the 19th century, American works referred to &#x27;refining brown sugar&#x27;. Americans also referred to the &#x27;Brown sugar of Commerce&#x27;, which could be refined with a yield of 70% of white sugar. In the United Kingdom it was the same. There were two kinds of raw sugar. The most common kind was muscovado, a.k.a. &quot;brown sugar&quot;, and was processed by British sugar refineries. The other kind of raw sugar was brown sugar which had been clayed and was known as clayed sugar. It was used for domestic purposes, but this usage was diminishing. In the 19th century United States the same meaning of the words raw sugar, brown sugar and muscovado was also noted: &quot;Raw sugar, commonly called muscovado or brown sugar, not advanced beyond its raw state by claying, boiling, clarifying or other process&quot;.

In the mid 20th century United States, &#x27;brown sugar&#x27; could refer to two products. It could be a raw sugar which had been centrifuged to a purity of about 97% pure sugar and that was offered as brown sugar in health food shops. However, in most cases it was white sugar to which molasses had been added. For the latter, a consumer magazine said, &quot;contrary to opinion, this brown sugar is a product of the refinery.&quot; The most important consideration is that the term &#x27;brown sugar&#x27; now came to refer to a product for consumers, instead of referring to a type of sugar that was processed by sugar refineries.

=== Smear campaign ===
In the late 19th century, the newly consolidated refined white sugar industry, which did not have full control over brown sugar production, mounted a smear campaign against brown sugar, reproducing microscopic photographs of harmless but repulsive-looking microbes living in brown sugar. The effort was so successful that by 1900, a best-selling cookbook warned that brown sugar was of inferior quality and was susceptible to infestation by &quot;a minute insect&quot;. This campaign of disinformation was also felt in other sectors using raw or brown sugar such as brewing;

==Production==
Brown sugar is most often produced by adding sugarcane molasses to completely refined white sugar crystals to more carefully control the ratio of molasses to sugar crystals and to reduce manufacturing costs. Brown sugar prepared in this manner is often much coarser than its unrefined equivalent and its molasses may be easily separated from the crystals by simply washing to reveal the underlying white sugar crystals; in contrast, with unrefined brown sugar, washing will reveal underlying crystals which are off-white due to the inclusion of molasses. The addition of molasses, beyond changing the flavor, changes the sugar&#x27;s characteristics during cooking, increasing the tendency for browning and making the sugar more hygroscopic. 

The molasses usually used for food is obtained from sugar cane, because the flavor is generally preferred over beet sugar molasses, although in some areas, especially in Belgium and the Netherlands, sugar beet molasses is used. The white sugar used can be from either beet or cane, as the chemical composition, nutritional value, color, and taste of fully refined white sugar is for practical purposes the same, no matter from what plant it originates. Even with less-than-perfect refining, the small differences in color, odor, and taste of the white sugar will be masked by the molasses.

==Natural brown sugar==

=== Definition ===
Natural brown sugar, raw sugar or whole cane sugar is sugar that retains some amount of the molasses from the mother liquor (the partially evaporated sugar cane juice). The term &#x27;natural brown sugar&#x27; can be traced back to at least the 1940s, when it was noted that the sugar refiners had pushed the brown sugar from the plantation owner out of the consumer market. Natural brown sugar was: &quot;The raw sugar, not the brown sugar most easily obtained, which usually is white sugar artificially colored.&quot; So the term &quot;natural brown sugar&quot; was devised to distinguish brown sugar that still contained part of its molasses, from brown sugar that was really white sugar to which molasses had been added.

=== Modern types of natural brown sugar ===
Some natural brown sugars have particular names and characteristics, and are sold as turbinado, demerara or raw sugar. These have been centrifuged, and therefore can be said to have been refined to a large degree. Muscovado is darkest of the modern types of natural brown sugar. 

Turbinado sugar is made from crystallized, partially evaporated sugar cane juice which has been spun in a centrifuge to remove almost all of the molasses. The sugar crystals are large and golden-coloured. This sugar can be sold as is or sent to the refinery to produce white sugar. Demerara sugar is now 97–99% pure sucrose and has also been centrifuged. What is now sold to the United States consumer as &#x27;raw sugar&#x27; is also a centrifuged product. If it were raw sugar in the generally accepted meaning of an unrefined product, the Food and Drug Administration would take action. Some say that for consumers, raw sugar means that the sugar is highly refined, but has been crystallized only once. 

Modern muscovado sugar sold to consumers is different from traditional muscovado. It is made by refining sugar with lime, but not centrifuging it. This means that impurities like dirt and ash are removed, but the molasses remains.

=== Traditional types of natural brown sugar ===
Brown sugars that have been only mildly centrifuged or unrefined (non-centrifuged) retain a much higher degree of molasses than products sold as natural brown sugar to consumers in developed nations. These traditional brown sugars are called various names across the globe often depending on their country of origin: e.g. muscovado, panela, rapadura, jaggery, piloncillo, etc.

Muscovado from the Portuguese &quot;&quot;, was the most common type of raw sugar and was also called brown sugar. In the 19th century, this was the sugar that based upon weight yielded about 70% white sugar when fully refined. 

Muscovado, panela, piloncillo, chancaca, jaggery and other natural dark brown sugars have been minimally centrifuged or not at all. Typically these sugars are made in smaller factories or &quot;cottage industries&quot; in developing nations, where they are produced with traditional practices that do not make use of industrialized vacuum evaporators or centrifuges. They are commonly boiled in open pans upon wood-fired stoves until the sugar cane juice reaches approximately 30% of the former volume and sucrose crystallization begins. They are then poured into molds to solidify or onto cooling pans where they are beaten or worked vigorously to produce a granulated brown sugar. In some countries, such as Mauritius or the Philippines, a natural brown sugar called muscovado is produced by partially centrifuging the evaporated and crystallizing cane juice to create a sugar-crystal rich mush, which is allowed to drain under gravity to produce varying degrees of molasses content in the final product. This process approximates a slightly modernized practice introduced in the 19th century to generate a better quality of natural brown sugar. 

A similar Japanese version of uncentrifuged natural cane sugar is called &quot;kokuto&quot; () or &quot;kurozato&quot; (). This is a regional specialty of Okinawa and is often sold in the form of large lumps. It is sometimes used to make shochu. Okinawan brown sugar is sometimes referred to as &#x27;black sugar&#x27; for its darker colour compared to other types of unrefined sugar, although when broken up into smaller pieces its colour becomes lighter. &quot;Kokuto&quot; is commonly used as a flavouring for drinks and desserts, but can also be eaten raw as it has a taste similar to caramel. &quot;Kokuto&quot; is also an important local industry on Amami Ōshima, Kagoshima Prefecture; sugarcane cultivation and the production of brown sugar in Japan was first recorded on the island around 400 years ago, using techniques that had been developed in Fujian Province, China, and spread across the Japanese archipelago after that point.

== Culinary and health considerations ==
Brown sugar adds flavor to desserts and baked goods. It can be substituted for maple sugar, and maple sugar can be substituted for it in recipes. Brown sugar caramelizes much more readily than refined sugar, and this effect can be used to make glazes and gravies brown while cooking.

For domestic purposes one can create the equivalent of brown sugar by mixing white sugar with molasses. Suitable proportions are about one tablespoon of molasses to each cup of sugar (one-sixteenth of the total volume). Molasses comprises about 10% of brown sugar&#x27;s total weight, which is about one ninth of the white sugar weight. Due to varying qualities and colors of molasses products, for lighter or darker sugar, reduce or increase its proportion according to taste.

In following a modern recipe that specifies &quot;brown sugar&quot;, one usually may assume that the intended meaning is light brown sugar, but how dark or light one prefers one&#x27;s sugar is largely a matter of taste. Even in recipes such as cakes, where the overall moisture content might be critical, the amount of water contained in brown sugar is too small to matter. Much more significant than its water content is the fact that darker brown sugar or more molasses will impart a stronger flavor, with more of a suggestion of caramel.

Brown sugar that has hardened can be made soft again by adding a new source of moisture for the molasses, or by heating and remelting the molasses. Storing brown sugar in a freezer will prevent moisture from escaping and molasses from crystallizing, allowing for a much longer shelf life. Mildly hardened brown sugar can be broken up with utensils or placed into a closed container and shaken.

Although brown sugar has been touted as having health benefits ranging from soothing menstrual cramps to serving as an anti-aging skin treatment, brown sugar is no better for health than refined sugar, despite the minerals it contains (the amounts are negligible).

== Nutritional value ==

One hundred grams of brown sugar contains 377 calories (nutrition table), as opposed to 387 calories in white sugar (link to nutrition table). However, brown sugar packs more densely than white sugar due to the smaller crystal size and may have more calories when measured by volume.

Any minerals present in brown sugar come from the molasses added to the white sugar. In a 100-gram reference amount, brown sugar contains 15% of the Daily Value for iron, with no other vitamins or minerals in significant content (table).

<text>Richard Terfry (born March 4, 1972), better known by his stage name Buck 65, is a Canadian alternative hip hop rapper. Underpinned by an extensive background in abstract hip hop, his more recent music has extensively incorporated blues, country, rock, folk and avant-garde influences.

Terfry is also a radio host, hosting the weekday &quot;Drive&quot; show on CBC Music since September 2, 2008. In addition, he once hosted a weekday program on CBC Radio 3&#x27;s web radio station.

==History==
===Early career and influences===
Terfry was born in 1972 and raised in Mount Uniacke, Nova Scotia, a rural community 40 km north of Halifax. He was first exposed to rap music in the mid-1980s while listening to CBC Stereo&#x27;s late-night show &quot;Brave New Waves&quot;, and then by listening to Halifax campus community radio station CKDU. CKDU then broadcast at only 33 watts, and he had to climb a tree in his yard to hear the station&#x27;s hip hop show on his radio. Fascinated by hip hop, the young Terfry taught himself how to rap, DJ, and, later, to produce records. In 1990, Terfry self-produced his first song, &quot;The Rhyme Has To Be Good&quot;, which later received airplay on the Halifax college radio station. His musical influences include MC Shan, David Lynch, Gitche Manitou and Kool Keith.

Using the moniker DJ Critical, he later hosted a hip-hop show on CKDU called &quot;The Bassment&quot; (later renamed &quot;The Treatment Program&quot; when he assumed the stage name Jesus Murphy), which aired for several years. This period overlapped with many of his non-major-label releases.

===Stage names===
Buck 65 has used a number of other stage names; these include Johnny Rockwell, Stinkin&#x27; Rich, Haslam, and Uncle Climax. These pseudonyms typically represent different characters in his raps (as in Uncle Climax, Johnny Rockwell and Stinkin&#x27; Rich) or different aspects of Buck&#x27;s creativity (as noted above, DJ Critical was his DJ name on CKDU).

He explains the origin of his main performance name as follows: &quot;I was born with the name Richard Terfry. Where I come from, it&#x27;s common when a boy is named after his father, for the father to refer to the son as &#x27;Buck&#x27;. I don&#x27;t know where that comes from or when it started. It might be a &#x27;out-in-the-country&#x27; thing. Growing up I knew lots of sons who were referred to as &#x27;Buck&#x27;. Sometimes even if they weren&#x27;t juniors. So the joke became, I was one of 65 (a number picked randomly) &#x27;Bucks&#x27; in my town.&quot;

However, when appearing on Andy Kershaw&#x27;s radio show in the UK on August 8, 2004, he gave a totally different explanation: some of his earliest public performances were with an older blues musician who used to joke that Terfry&#x27;s regularity at showing up made him as reliable as a 1965 Buick. The nickname Buick 65 stuck until it was misprinted on a publicity poster as &#x27;Buck 65&#x27; which he then adopted as his stage name.

Buck 65 has recorded an EP under the name of Dirk Thornton alongside Irishman DJ Flip; it was scheduled for release early 2007 but the date was not set. The first release under Dirk Thornton was a 7-inch vinyl single with the tracks &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s News&quot; and &quot;Catwalk.&quot;

===Early releases===
In 1993, he released his first cassette of rap tunes while performing under the alias Stinkin&#x27; Rich on the Halifax label No Records. The five song cassette was titled &quot;Chin Music&quot;, which was a reference to his interest in baseball. The release brought Stinkin&#x27; Rich to the attention of members of Halifax alternative rock band Sloan. Sloan signed him to their independent record label Murderecords and released a 7-inch single and a full-length cassette called &quot;Game Tight&quot;, again featuring a reference to baseball. As Stinkin&#x27; Rich, he also appeared on numerous songs by Halifax hip hop band Hip Club Groove.

After a brief break, Terfry returned reconstituted as Buck 65, releasing &quot;Weirdo Magnet&quot; (on Metaforensics) and &quot;Language Arts&quot; in 1996, followed by &quot;Vertex&quot; in 1997 (both on Four Ways to Rock/Metaforensics), and the 12&quot; single &quot;The Wildlife&quot; (on Hand&#x27;Solo Records) in 1998. He recorded &quot;Sebutonedef&quot; (released in 1996 by Funtrip Records) as a collaboration with fellow Halifax artist Sixtoo. Other releases by the duo, known as Sebutones, are &quot;Psoriasis&quot; and &quot;50/50 Where It Counts&quot;. While still far from mainstream success, he received several odd jobs in Canada&#x27;s entertainment industry, including making soundtrack music and providing narration for a TV commercial for NBA apparel, and song lyrics for the popular children&#x27;s program &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

&quot;Man Overboard&quot;, originally released on Anticon in 2001, was a significant turning point in his career. The record, and the entire Anticon collective (of which Sixtoo was also a part), were considered hallmarks of a new avant-garde movement in underground hip hop. It was at this time that Buck met Cincinnati DJ Mr. Dibbs, who inducted him into the 1200 Hobos, a loosely knit hip-hop collective named for their proficiency in manipulating the Technics 1200 turntable. Also in 2001, Buck performed at the Snow Jam festival in 2001, and later that year, he released his next studio album, &quot;Synesthesia&quot;, on Endemik Records; the album was re-released the next year with a significantly different track listing on Warner Music Canada.

===Major label releases===

In 2002, Buck 65 signed a record deal with Warner Music Canada, which subsequently released much of his back catalogue, including &quot;Weirdo Magnet&quot;, &quot;Language Arts&quot;, &quot;Vertex&quot;, &quot;Man Overboard&quot;, and &quot;Synesthesia&quot;. During this time, he released two albums for the label, the first being &quot;Square&quot; in 2002, which was nominated for a Juno Award in 2003 for Alternative Album of the Year and Album Design of the Year. In 2003, Buck 65 released &quot;Talkin&#x27; Honky Blues&quot;, which saw a major stylistic shift in his music, incorporating elements of country music, folk, bluegrass, and electronica, amongst other musical styles; it later won the 2004 Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year.

After a deal was signed with V2 Records in the United States, &quot;This Right Here Is Buck 65&quot; was released in early 2005. The album is a compilation of previously released songs, re-recordings, and B-sides that was marketed as an introduction to his work for U.S. audiences. However, after V2 chose not to release his next effort, &quot;Secret House Against the World&quot;, the deal was amicably dissolved. &quot;Secret House Against the World&quot; was released in 2005 by Warner Music Canada, and saw Buck further experimenting with varying musical styles. Buck 65 gained additional recognition in 2006 when he appeared at the national Juno Awards with Pamela Anderson.

===&quot;Dirty Work&quot;, &quot;Situation&quot; and &quot;Dirtbike&quot;===
In late 2006, Buck 65 released a 5-song digital EP called &quot;Dirty Work&quot;. It was released over a month-long campaign, adding one song per week for free download via his website.

Buck 65 released the album &quot;Situation&quot; on October 30, 2007, on Strange Famous Records in the United States and Warner Music Group worldwide. The album is a concept album based around the year 1957, and is a return to a more &quot;pure&quot; hip hop sound than the previous blues, country and avant-garde influences in &quot;Secret House Against the World&quot;. It was produced by fellow Halifax DJ Skratch Bastid, aimed at making a &quot;classic hip-hop record that pulses with joy and clarity of purpose&quot;. The album appeared on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart for one week at number 31.

He played with Symphony Nova Scotia in the Rebecca Cohn Auditorium on April 18, 2008.

In late 2008, Buck 65 released three one-track albums for free download. The three &quot;Dirtbike&quot; albums featured guest production and verses by Cadence Weapon, Emily Wells, D-Styles, Skratch Bastid, Serafina Steer, Jorun, Moka Only, Aupheus, Mia Clarke of Electrelane, Doseone among others. &quot;Dirtbike 1/3&quot; signified a return to Buck 65&#x27;s pre-&quot;Talkin&#x27; Honky Blues&quot; hip hop roots that was expected in &quot;Situation&quot;; in Buck 65&#x27;s own words &quot;it&#x27;s a lot like the original versions of &quot;Vertex&quot; and &quot;Man Overboard&quot;.&quot;

In 2009, Buck 65 contributed &quot;Blood Pt. 2&quot; to the AIDS benefit album, &quot;Dark Was the Night&quot;, produced by the Red Hot Organization. It is a remix of Sufjan Stevens&#x27; take on the song &quot;You Are the Blood&quot;, originally by Castanets.

Buck 65 formed Bike for Three! with Belgian producer Greetings from Tuskan (born Joëlle Phuong Minh Lê). Their debut album, &quot;More Heart Than Brains&quot;, was released on Anticon on May 26, 2009. The album features &quot;sharp lyrical details and storytelling&quot; by Buck 65, combined with Phuong Minh Lê&#x27;s production creating an &quot;exquisite, shimmering landscape that rarely plays by the rules.&quot;

===&quot;20 Odd Years&quot;, &quot;Neverlove&quot;, and &quot;Laundromat Boogie&quot;===
On February 1, 2011, Buck 65 released &quot;20 Odd Years&quot;, named in honor of his twentieth anniversary in the music industry. The album continued the tradition of combining several different musical styles, and featured many different guest collaborators. The album was preceded by a series of four EPs, released digitally and on 7&quot; vinyl: &quot;20 Odd Years, Vol. 1: Avant&quot; (released June 8, 2010); &quot;20 Odd Years, Vol. 2: Distance&quot; (July 12, 2010); &quot;20 Odd Years, Vol. 3: Albuquerque&quot; (August 10, 2010); and &quot;20 Odd Years, Vol. 4: Cenotaph&quot; (September 14, 2010). The latter EP was withdrawn from availability, presumably due to copyright issues involving Buck&#x27;s sampling of the Bronski Beat single, &quot;Smalltown Boy.&quot; The album primarily featured songs from these EPs, including a cover of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Who By Fire&quot;, as well as two previously unreleased songs. Buck 65 later released an additional EP in the series titled &quot;20 Odd Years Vol. 4: Ostranenie&quot; (November 21, 2011).

Buck 65 released &quot;Neverlove&quot; on September 30, 2014. The album was inspired by his divorce from his ex-wife. One day before its release, he also released the more lighthearted, and previously unannounced, album &quot;Laundromat Boogie&quot; through producer Jorun Bombay&#x27;s Bandcamp page. Prior to the release of &quot;Neverlove&quot;, a music video for the album track &quot;Super Pretty Naughty&quot; was to be premiered by Entertainment Tonight, but according to Buck 65 on his website, &quot;...when they saw the video and heard the song, they banned it from their show for what they deemed to be objectionable visual and lyrical content.&quot;

===Hiatus===
Terfry released an autobiography &quot;Wicked and Weird: The amazing tales of Buck 65&quot; in 2015.
Buck 65 played two shows with Symphony Nova Scotia on October 2 and 3, 2015 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in one of his final appearances before an extended hiatus. He was unable to perform a scheduled DJ set at the CBC Music Festival in Toronto on May 28, 2016, due to last-minute technical difficulties.

Aside from a performance on July 10, 2018, at a tribute concert for the late Anticon Records co-founder Brendon Whitney aka Alias, Buck 65 was on a musical hiatus from October 2015 until early 2020.

===Return to recording===
In May 2020, Controller 7 released a new album, featuring Buck 65 on vocals and DJ scratches.

He released a new album, &quot;King of Drums&quot; in 2022. Critic Robert Christgau put it at No. 7 on his 2022 Dean&#x27;s List. That year also included collaboration albums with Tachichi (&#x27;Flash Grenade&#x27;) and Birdapres (&#x27;The Last Dig&#x27;).

Two Buck 65 albums were released in 2023: &quot;Super Dope&quot; and &quot;Punk Rock B-Boy&quot;, and both were listed in Robert Christgau&#x27;s Dean&#x27;s List for 2023 at No. 2 and No. 39, respectively.

==Radio work==

Terfry was a host on CBC Radio 3&#x27;s web radio in 2006 and 2007. He accepted the host role on CBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Radio 2 Drive&quot; beginning fall 2008. He continues to host Drive daily from 3:30pm to 7pm EST. In the summer of 2021, he hosted &quot;Deep Dive&quot; on CBC Radio One on Saturday nights, which was a program playing classic pop music albums with Terfry giving background information on the albums.

<text>Paul William &quot;Sage&quot; Francis (born November 18, 1976) is an American independent underground rapper from Providence, Rhode Island. He is the founder and CEO of Strange Famous Records.

== Early life and education ==
Francis was born in Miami, Florida, but grew up in Providence, Rhode Island. He is an only child and grew up for most of his childhood with his mother and stepfather after his parents divorced when he was young. He lived in different parts of Rhode Island including North Smithfield and Woonsocket. His mom worked as a bartender and his stepfather worked as a locksmith.

Francis began writing and recording original lyrics at age 8, being inspired by acts such as Run DMC and Public Enemy. According to Artistdirect, Francis began sneaking out of his parents&#x27; house at age 12 to participate in rap battles.

Francis received a degree in communications from Dean College in Franklin, Massachusetts and a degree in journalism from the University of Rhode Island.

==Career==
In 1996, he recorded his first official demo tape, and by 1998 he had a radio show on WRIU called &quot;True School Session&quot;.

Francis won the Superbowl MC Battle in Boston in 1999, beating Esoteric. Francis won the Scribble Jam emcee battle in 2000, beating Blueprint.

In 2001, the song &quot;Makeshift Patriot,&quot; recorded on October 11, 2001, became an Internet hit for its critique of American media during and immediately following the September 11 attacks. Francis considers &quot;Makeshift Patriot&quot; to be the song that really made things come together for him. It was on the 2002 mix tape, &quot;The Known Unsoldier – Sick Of Waging War...&quot; and was widely circulated for free.

He released the critically acclaimed first solo album &quot;Personal Journals&quot; in 2002. The record &quot;Hope,&quot; his only album with Joe Beats released under the name Non-Prophets, was named after the state of Rhode Island&#x27;s motto of hope, and was meant to be very Rhode Island-centric.

Francis broke music genre barriers by getting signed to Epitaph Records, making himself the first hip hop artist to sign with the punk rock label. He released three albums with Epitaph: &quot;A Healthy Distrust&quot;, &quot;Human the Death Dance&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;.

Francis has described &quot;A Healthy Distrust&quot; as being a political record, which reflected his mistrust of government and big business with a focus on socio-political matters.

In May 2007, a music video of the song &quot;Got Up This Morning&quot; from &quot;Human the Death Dance&quot; was released. The song featured vocals by Jolie Holland and beats produced by Buck 65. The video featured cameos from B. Dolan, Brother Ali, Buck 65, Divinci from Solillaquists of Sound, Holland, Slug, and Tom Inhaler from Francis&#x27; band and Strange Famous Records

&quot;Life&quot; was a shift into a different style for Francis, focusing on spoken word and indie rock. The record featured contributions and collaborations with Califone, Chris Walla, Jason Lytle, and Mark Linkous.

Francis made a guest appearance on Bad Religion&#x27;s &quot;The Empire Strikes First&quot;, on the track &quot;Let Them Eat War&quot;.

In 2014, Francis released &quot;Copper Gone&quot; after a four-year break from touring. The album was named after the phenomenon Francis saw in his neighborhood where abandoned buildings would have their copper pipes stripped to be sold, and then tagged as &quot;Copper Gone&quot; to let others know that there was no copper left to steal.

Francis says that he has been releasing mix tapes consistently since 1999, and will continue to release the &quot;Sick of...&quot; mix tape series on an ongoing basis.

Francis has toured extensively, and has performed shows with Atmosphere, Brother Ali, and Eyedea &amp; Abilities.

== Epic Beard Men ==
Francis collaborated with B. Dolan under the name Epic Beard Men. The duo&#x27;s official debut single, &quot;War on Christmas&quot;, was released in 2017. In 2018, the duo released the &quot;Season 1&quot; EP, as well as &quot;Five Hearts&quot;, a single from the EP. In 2019, the duo released the first studio album, &quot;This Was Supposed to Be Fun&quot;. It includes &quot;You Can&#x27;t Tell Me Shit&quot;, which became &quot;The Stranger&quot;″s &quot;Inbox Jukebox Track of the Day&quot;. The album was placed at number 20 on &quot;PopMatters&quot;″ &quot;20 Best Hip-Hop Albums of 2019&quot; list.

== Strange Famous Records ==

Francis is the founder and CEO of the independent hip hop record label Strange Famous Records. The label first began in 1996 as a way for him to release his previously unreleased songs in the late 1990s. It has since evolved into an official enterprise with an expanding roster of like-minded artists. He released several &quot;Sick Of&quot; mixtapes available on his website.

== Social activism ==
Francis worked with fellow rapper B. Dolan who had the idea to start an organization and website named KnowMore.org aka KnowMore: The People&#x27;s Corporation Watch Project which focused on connecting consumers with social responsibility information about corporations and responsible consumerism.

Francis went to South Africa to work on solutions to AIDS in South Africa, especially in regards to children. As part of that effort he was part of a documentary on HIV in South Africa.

== Other work ==
Francis is also part of the contemporary spoken word movement. His relationship with the Providence poetry slam community (he was on their 1998, 1999 and 2002 national poetry slam teams) led to it being called &quot;The House that Sage Francis Built.&quot; From 2000 to 2002, he also DJ-ed for the NYC-Urbana poetry slam, a weekly slam series held at the legendary punk rock venue CBGB.

<text>Jakob Rosanes (also Jacob; 16 August 1842 – 6 January 1922) was a German mathematician who worked on algebraic geometry and invariant theory. He was also a chess master.

Rosanes was a grandson of Rabbi Akiva Eiger, one of the most revered Jewish religious scholars of the Talmud and &quot;halachic&quot; decisors of the 18th century. Eiger&#x27;s daughter Baila was Rosanes&#x27; mother. Rosanes grew up during a period when the Enlightenment and increasing opportunities for social, academic and economic advancement for culturally assimilated Jews influenced large numbers of Jews to reconsider their faith. He was not religiously observant, and his children converted to Christianity. 

Rosanes studied at University of Berlin and the University of Breslau. He obtained his doctorate from Breslau (Wrocław) in 1865 and taught there for the rest of his working life. He became professor in 1876 and rector of the university during the years 1903–1904.

Rosanes made significant contributions in Cremona transformations.

== Notable chess games ==
* Jakob Rosanes vs Adolf Anderssen, Breslau 1862, Spanish Game: Berlin Defense. Rio Gambit Accepted (C67), 1-0 Sometimes, Rosanes was able to beat even one of the best masters of his time, Adolf Anderssen... 
* Jakob Rosanes vs Adolf Anderssen, Breslau, 1863, King&#x27;s Gambit: Accepted. Kieseritzky Gambit Anderssen Defense (C39), 0-1 ...but as shows this beautiful game, the opposite result was probably quite usual in their games.

<text>Sydney Anne Bristow (played by Jennifer Garner) is a fictional character and the protagonist of the television series &quot;Alias&quot;. She is an American woman with a Russian-Canadian family background who thought she was working as a spy for the CIA when, in fact, she was one of the operatives working for a criminal organization known as SD-6 — one of the arms of the terrorist group The Alliance of Twelve. Eventually, Sydney learns the truth about her employers and becomes herself a spy for the CIA.

Sydney is depicted in the series as being strong both physically and emotionally. She deals with some significant trauma over the years: the death of her fiancé, the death of her best friend, the realization that her mother was a former KGB spy, the estrangement of many of her friends and the constant activity and changes that she must endure from being a spy on a regular basis. Sydney is highly skilled in Krav Maga and is a hyper polyglot, speaking English, Russian, German, Greek, Dutch, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Swedish, Romanian, Hungarian, Hebrew, Uzbek, Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Indonesian, Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Vietnamese, Polish, Serbian, Czech, Ukrainian, and Bulgarian in various episodes. Throughout the series her code names are Bluebird, Freelancer, Mountaineer, and Phoenix.

==Character biography==
Sydney Bristow was born April 17, 1975. For the first six years of her life she lived with both of her parents, Jonathan (a.k.a. Jack) and Laura Bristow (real name Irina Derevko). However, her father&#x27;s work with the CIA kept him away from home much of the time. Sydney and her family were living in rural Maryland until Jack was transferred to Los Angeles when Sydney was two. In 1981 her mother, who was also an undercover agent for the KGB, faked her own death to prevent being apprehended by the FBI. Afterwards Jack was taken into custody for some time, because it was believed that he also was part of a larger conspiracy.

Jack named Arvin Sloane as Sydney&#x27;s temporary guardian and Sydney went to live with Sloane and his wife Emily, for a time (Note that this is a retcon as it was previously established that Sydney did not meet Arvin or Emily until Sydney had already started working for SD-6. Sydney herself had stated that she had large memory gaps from around the time of her mother&#x27;s death and can only remember that her father began drinking heavily and became more of an absentee father, leaving Sydney to be raised by nannies. Later it is revealed that the memory gaps are due to Jack, who after finally having been cleared, tested Project Christmas on Sydney, so that she would never be recruited by the KGB, and like all the candidates tested, the training ended with Sydney&#x27;s memory erased).

When Sydney was 19 years old and a freshman in college, a man approached her and told her that he worked with US intelligence and that they wanted to interview her because she fit a profile. She declined at first but then decided to join them. After meeting with an organization she believed was the Central Intelligence Agency, she signed &quot;dozens of non-disclosure agreements&quot; and was offered a job.

They had Sydney take a job as an office assistant on the twentieth floor of &quot;Credit Dauphine&quot;, a corporate bank in downtown Los Angeles. She assumed that the bank was somehow affiliated with the CIA. When she told her father about her job after about a month, he ordered her to quit because as a double agent within SD-6, he knew the bank was a front. Sydney angrily refused to quit and this led to the beginning of a several-year estrangement in their relationship.

Eventually she was told that she was ready for the transition, which involved eight months of training. It was during the training that Sydney first heard the term SD-6. At this time, she believed that SD-6 was affiliated with the CIA, that it was a black ops division of the CIA, funded by the CIA&#x27;s black budget. They led her to believe that SD-6 was one of these divisions and that that was why they did not operate through Langley, Virginia.

The transition ended when they made reference to SD-6 headquarters. They told her they would take her there. What she did not realize was that the headquarters were in the same building. Her role within SD-6 was desk work, at first, but she advanced quickly. Within the first year, she was assigned to reconnaissance missions.

Sydney was told that the objective of SD-6 was &quot;the retrieval and study of intelligence, both military and industrial, throughout the world that is critical to the superiority and survival of the United States of America.&quot;

Seven years after joining SD-6, Sydney discovered that SD-6 was actually a branch of the Alliance of Twelve, an international organized crime group involved in the trade of intelligence and weapons, and was an enemy of the United States.

==Storylines==
===Season 1===
Sydney was engaged to be married to her boyfriend Danny Hecht, but he was killed by SD-6 after Sydney told him that she worked for the CIA. Shortly thereafter, she was informed of what SD-6 was by her mostly estranged father, who worked in the highest levels of SD-6.

Sydney went to the real CIA with her knowledge of SD-6, and was recruited by the CIA into working as a double agent to bring down SD-6. Her handler, Agent Michael Vaughn, and who is her ongoing love interest on the show, gives her missions from the CIA. She soon learns that her own father is a double agent as well. During her time at SD-6, Sydney performed missions with Marcus Dixon, who sometimes became suspicious that Sydney was a double agent. Dixon was still under the impression that SD-6 was part of the U.S. Government. Sydney had to balance all these new revelations with keeping all these secrets from her friends, notably Will Tippin and Francie Calfo.

During this season, the head of SD-6, Arvin Sloane, was obsessed with Milo Rambaldi, a man from the 15th century who was able to create brilliant devices that were far ahead of their time. Sydney worked on a number of missions to retrieve or modify these Rambaldi devices to prevent them from falling into the hands of SD-6. During the season finale, on one such mission to destroy such a device, Sydney is captured and discovers that the organization that SD-6 has been pursuing is being run by Irina Derevko, Sydney&#x27;s mother and a former KGB spy.

===Season 2===
During season 2, Sydney continues to act as a double agent inside SD-6 and also performs direct missions for the CIA. Irina Derevko turns herself in to the CIA and provides valuable information to help bring down SD-6. Midway through the season, the CIA finally has enough information to bring down the entire Alliance organization and the assault on SD-6 headquarters, led by Sydney and Vaughn. The organization comes tumbling down, but Sloane gets away and is now working covertly with Julian Sark.

Following the fall of SD-6, Sydney decides she wants to leave the CIA but finds herself unable to do so knowing that Sloane is still free. Sydney also has to work to make amends with Dixon, who is bitter that Sydney knew SD-6 was not part of the U.S. Government and didn&#x27;t tell him, although they are eventually able to patch things up and Dixon begins to work with the CIA.

During this time, Sydney&#x27;s friend and roommate Francie has secretly been assassinated and replaced by an agent of Sloane and Sark&#x27;s, Allison Doren. Sydney eventually figures out that &quot;Francie&quot; is not who she says she is and the two engage in a battle which destroys the entire apartment. Sydney shoots Allison three times, apparently killing her, but Sydney is also severely wounded and passes out.

When Sydney wakes up, she is in Hong Kong and comes to find out that two years have passed without her knowledge.

Season 2 saw a fundamental change in Sydney&#x27;s character, allegedly introduced in order to give the show more action. In the first season, Sydney almost never kills, preferring fisticuffs and tranquilizer guns to deadly blows and real bullets. Starting this season, she behaves more like a stereotypical spy, usually killing enemies and rarely using tranq guns. Although there were some minor incidents prior, the episode &quot;Phase One&quot; is generally considered to mark the arrival of this new version of Sydney. While some fans have criticized this change in Sydney&#x27;s character, others have suggested that it might have been influenced by the arrival of her mother. During season 2 Sydney also begins to dress and act more sexually to achieve her goals.

===Season 3===
Sydney now has to deal with the pain of not knowing what has happened for the previous two years of her life, but also the fact that Vaughn is now married to another woman, National Security Council liaison Lauren Reed. Sydney tries to manipulate the CIA to stay in the loop of the organization (they don&#x27;t trust her because of her absence).

Sydney learns that an organization known as The Covenant seems to be involved with her disappearance. In the meantime, Sydney continues to perform missions for the CIA, while working with her father to find out more about her past.

Eventually Sydney learns through FBI Assistant Director Kendall (who is actually the director of the Department of Special Research) that she worked in the employ of the Covenant as a supposedly brainwashed assassin, although she was able to resist their attempts to manipulate her due to her experiences with Project Christmas and report to the CIA during this time. Eventually, she wiped her own memories to conceal information and perhaps also because of the horrifying realization that the Covenant had extracted her eggs in order to fulfill one of Rambaldi&#x27;s prophecies. She was also greatly disturbed that she chose to kill an unarmed man in cold blood rather than risk losing her cover as a brainwashed assassin.

Sydney and Vaughn continue to suppress their feelings for each other in light of Vaughn&#x27;s relationship with Lauren. However, it is discovered that Lauren is actually an agent working for the Covenant, although both Sydney and Vaughn are, at first, unaware of this fact.

The CIA learns that there is a mole in the Los Angeles office. Jack is assigned to find the mole and soon starts to suspect Lauren. Jack confronts Lauren&#x27;s father, Senator Reed, but he dismisses it.

Meanwhile Vaughn decides to separate from Lauren. Lauren tells Sark and Sark explains that the last time Vaughn strayed from a relationship because of Sydney he quickly reconnected when his then-girlfriend Alice Williams&#x27; father died. Sark orders Lauren to kill her father. Lauren cannot go through with it but her mother bursts in and finishes the job. They frame Senator Reed for being the mole. Vaughn quickly recommits to Lauren, breaking Sydney&#x27;s heart.

On a mission to meet a Covenant asset, Sydney sees Lauren. When she tells Vaughn he dismisses it. Sydney talks to Jack and then Jack talks to Vaughn telling him the signs that his wife is betraying him. When Vaughn becomes suspicious he looks in Lauren&#x27;s suitcase and discovers evidence that she does work for the Covenant.

Vaughn tells Jack and Sydney and he is ordered by Dixon to pretend that he is unaware of Lauren&#x27;s betrayal. Lauren soon finds out that she has been played by Vaughn and she and Sark kidnap him. After torturing him and failing to get any information they leave him for dead. Weiss finds Vaughn and he is taken to the hospital.

Sydney soon discovers that the Passenger is Nadia Santos, her half-sister by the way of an affair between Irina and Sloane. After a rescue mission, Sydney&#x27;s sister is taken by Sloane so he can get the formula that was stored in her brain by Rambaldi (actually her unique nervous system can replay the graphical hand movements encoded in the Rambaldi Fluid-protein strands that cause unconscious, movements like handwriting). Sydney rescues her again, but Nadia later elects to accompany Sloane in search of the Rambaldi artifact known as The Sphere of Life.

Lauren enters the CIA office disguised as Sydney and steals information. Sark is captured and interviewed by Vaughn. Sark gives up Lauren and Vaughn resolves to kill her. Vaughn tracks her down and brings her to an empty warehouse. As Lauren dangles from the ceiling, Vaughn states that he loves Sydney more than he hates Lauren thus he will not kill Lauren. He does, however, plan to douse her in hydrochloric acid, rendering her unrecognizable. Sydney&#x27;s aunt, the ambiguous Katya Derevko, stabs him in the back. When Sydney learns about Vaughn, she goes after Lauren herself. Vaughn goes after her and arrives just in time to save Sydney from Lauren. As Vaughn and Sydney kiss, Lauren tries to make one last shot. Vaughn sees this and shoots her dead. Before Lauren dies she tells Sydney that there is a safe deposit box in Wittenburg that has information about her.

Sydney goes to the box and finds secret CIA documents about her. Jack gets there and tells her that she was never supposed to find them.

===Season 4===
Several months after her discovery, Sydney is once again estranged from her father, having discovered (through the secret documents) that he had killed Irina Derevko. Following a botched mission in Shanghai, she receives a dressing down at a performance review, is demoted, and is subsequently dismissed from the CIA.

In truth, Sydney has been recruited into APO (Authorized Personnel Only), a new black ops division of the CIA patterned after SD-6. Much to her dismay, this new agency is headed by Sloane, who oversees a handpicked team which includes Sydney, Jack Bristow, Vaughn, and Dixon. During APO&#x27;s first mission, Marshall is also recruited, as is her half-sister, Nadia. Her former colleague, Eric Weiss, thinks that Sydney is working for a bank - the same cover she had used when working for SD-6.

During the course of APO&#x27;s first mission, to bring down a terrorist and assassin-for-hire, she learns the man was actually hired to kill her - by Irina. Jack subsequently killed Irina to protect his daughter. Meanwhile, Sydney rekindles her romance with Vaughn. Later, it is revealed that Irina is not actually dead - Jack killed a genetic double in an elaborate deception orchestrated by Irina&#x27;s evil sister, Elena, who recruits Sloane in activating a huge Mueller device invented by Rambaldi, which has the potential to destroy the world. Irina is rescued from Elena&#x27;s clutches and reunited with her family - including Nadia, who she hasn&#x27;t seen for years - and together they fly to Russia to stop Elena&#x27;s plans.

Around this time, after some twists and turns and ups and downs in their relationship, Vaughn finally proposes marriage prior to the mission to go after Elena. Sydney doesn&#x27;t answer just yet. Finally, when she is about to destroy the Mueller device, Sydney goes back to Vaughn and gives him an affirmative reply.

During the mission in Russia, it is revealed that Sloane was able to infiltrate the drinking water of the city through his charity, and all who had drunk this water and were exposed to the Mueller device were genetically altered and became excessively violent. When Nadia is captured by Elena, she is injected with the infected water and consequently attempts to kill Sydney.

The season ends on a cliffhanger when Vaughn reveals to Sydney that his real name is not Michael Vaughn, and depending on who is asked, he might be a &quot;bad guy&quot;. At that moment, their car is T-boned by an unknown assailant.

===Season 5===
Sydney and Vaughn survive the car crash, but Vaughn is taken by their assailants. He manages to escape and tells Sydney that his real name is André Michaux. He also tells her that he&#x27;s been working for several years to uncover the activities of a mysterious organization known as Prophet Five. His father before him had also worked to gather intel on Prophet Five. Shortly thereafter, Sydney learns she is pregnant and Vaughn is shot and apparently killed by a rogue agent posing as a CIA officer. Four months later, Sydney makes contact with Renée Rienne, an assassin on the CIA&#x27;s most wanted list, who had been working with Vaughn, and whose father had worked with Vaughn&#x27;s father, to bring down Prophet Five.

Sydney finds a kindred spirit in Rachel Gibson, a young, wide-eyed, inexperienced agent rescued from &quot;The Shed&quot;, a covert criminal organization that, much like SD-6, operates under the alias of a CIA black-ops division. Gibson, like Sydney years earlier, had been duped into believing she was working for the CIA. Now a member of APO, Gibson is learning the ways of being a field agent, with Sydney her designated handler, just as Michael had worked with her. With Nadia still comatose in the hospital, Gibson has moved into Sydney&#x27;s home.

Sydney has also put at least some demons of the past behind her. Now fully reconciled with her father, she has also expressed some forgiveness of Sloane, to the point of writing a letter of recommendation for Sloane&#x27;s release hearing.

Sydney continues to go on missions when her condition allows, often using the pregnancy as part of her disguises. However, in the episode &quot;Solo&quot;, she came to realize that these days might be fast coming to a (temporary) end when she is not allowed to go on a mission due to her condition.

Three weeks before her due date, Sydney is captured by Prophet Five in order to force her (via a form of drug-induced hypnosis) to remember details of a giant SD-6 flowchart that she had been shown by Michael Vaughn during one of their first meetings. Encouraged by her mental recreation of Michael Vaughn, she is able to resist the hypnosis and provide false information to her kidnappers (who, unbeknownst to Sydney, include Irina). Sydney discovers that she has been stranded aboard a freighter at sea where she attempts to elude Prophet Five and one of their associates, Kelly Peyton. During this incident, she discovers that her family doctor is actually a Prophet Five agent, and suffers a complication with her pregnancy that (to her later surprise) is corrected by Prophet Five and the baby is saved.

After being extracted by APO, Sydney is reunited with her mother and together with her and Jack they travel to Vancouver in order to obtain a mysterious object called &quot;The Horizon&quot; which Prophet Five believed Sydney possessed. During this mission, which is complicated by the discovery that Irina works for Prophet Five and a subsequent attack by Peyton, Sydney goes into labor and — with the aid of Irina and Jack — gives birth to a baby girl, named Isabelle. Irina subsequently disappears with The Horizon.

After the birth of Isabelle, it is revealed that Vaughn didn&#x27;t die. After his shooting, Jack helped him fake his death and hide in Bhutan.

About a month after giving birth, Sydney returns to duty when Anna Espinosa is recruited by Peyton to kidnap Will Tippin. Espinosa implants an explosive in Tippin&#x27;s head and demands that page 47 of Rambaldi&#x27;s manuscript be turned over to her in return for the disarming code. Sydney and Will battle Anna but lose page 47, and in the process Anna uses an unknown chemical agent to collect genetic material from Sydney. Anna goes through the genetic doubling process and becomes Sydney&#x27;s duplicate.

After Anna kills Renée Rienne while she is on a mission with APO, a chip bearing Michael Vaughn&#x27;s real name (André Michaux) is discovered implanted in her body. The chip bears what appears to be a corrupted code. Sydney heads to Nepal to meet with Vaughn but is intercepted by an agent of Prophet Five while Anna keeps Sydney&#x27;s rendezvous with Vaughn. Anna and Vaughn discover that Vaughn has the other half of the code on a chip implanted in his body and after deciphering the code he and Anna head to Germany. They discover a bunker containing all of Vaughn&#x27;s father&#x27;s research on Prophet Five. Vaughn reveals that he knows Anna is not Sydney and they fight. Anna gains the upper hand until Sydney shoots her in the head, killing her. Sydney goes undercover as Anna to infiltrate Prophet Five and meets up with Peyton.

Sydney, still undercover as Anna, meets Sloane and learns that she is to seek a rose from an ancient Italian monastery. She meets up with Julian Sark in Italy and he gets them arrested to infiltrate the prison that stands where the monastery once did. Sydney discovers an elderly man who identifies himself as The Rose. The Rose gives Sydney an amulet and tells her she can&#x27;t stop Prophet Five from carrying out its plans. While Peyton extracts Sark from the prison, Sloane attempts to kill Sydney, still believing she is Anna. Sydney survives the attempt but Sloane escapes with the amulet. Sydney and Vaughn return to Los Angeles, where Vaughn meets his daughter for the first time. Their happiness is short-lived, however, as Sydney gets a call from Sloane, who has figured out that she is still alive.

Sydney finally travels to Sydney, Australia as part of an APO mission to get intel on the twelve leaders of Prophet Five. She successfully captures intel on three of the twelve and returns to Los Angeles.

Shortly thereafter, Marshall and Rachel are abducted by Peyton and Sark respectively and Sydney encounters Sloane, who convinces her to get Marshall to help him locate a certain cavern. Marshall is able to pass a message to Sydney, who, working with Marshall&#x27;s wife Carrie, is able to locate Marshall and Rachel and mount a rescue. Marshall and Rachel advise the team that Sloane is seeking a cave in Italy and Sydney deduces that Sloane is headed for Mount Subasio. She and Vaughn travel there and Sydney descends into the cave. There she encounters Sloane again, with the amulet she recovered earlier. Sloane fires several rounds into the floor of the cave at Sydney&#x27;s feet, causing the floor to give way. Vaughn rescues Sydney and performs CPR on her.

The team next tracks Sloane to Mongolia and the tomb of Milo Rambaldi. There Sydney encounters Sloane yet again as he implements his endgame by placing the Horizon on an altar, thus creating a red, hovering ball-shaped fluid similar to that created by the Mueller device. Sydney disrupts Sloane&#x27;s plans by grabbing the Horizon from the altar, causing the ball to collapse in a torrent of red liquid. Sark leads Jack and Vaughn into the tomb after capturing them, and Sloane shoots Jack in the chest to force Sydney and Vaughn to leave. Seeing her father severely wounded, Sydney grabs a gun and eventually shoots Sloane several times, who crashes into the puddle of Rambaldi-fluid. With Sloane seemingly dead, Sydney tries to stay with her bleeding father, but he begs her to leave him and to stop Irina. Sydney reluctantly obeys and departs for Hong Kong for a final confrontation with Irina. Jack drags himself back into the tomb and confronts Sloane, who has become immortal because of the fluid. Sloane offers to heal Jack, but Jack tells Sloane that he has caused so much pain for Sydney over the years that he will not allow him to do it again and reveals a bomb that he strapped to his body and detonates it, killing himself. The explosion causes a cave in and Sloane is trapped in there forever.

In Hong Kong, Sydney and Irina clash a final time, with Sydney seeking to stop Irina from using the Horizon to gain immortality. In the course of the fight, Irina ends up atop a glass skylight, the Horizon just inches away from her. With the glass cracking under Irina&#x27;s weight, Sydney pleads with her to take her hand. Irina refuses and attempts to grab the Horizon. The glass breaks completely, causing Irina to fall to her death.

The series ends a few years into the future. Sydney and Vaughn are married and semi-retired and are now living in a beachside house on an obviously very far off island. Dixon comes to visit and is greeted by Vaughn and Sydney, who is holding their second child who is named Jack after Sydney&#x27;s father. Isabelle has found the blocks for Project Christmas and assembles them in no time, but dismantles it after Sydney calls for her and she joins her family outside. As everyone walks down the beach, the screen cuts to black with the message: THANK YOU FOR FIVE INCREDIBLE YEARS.

==Casting==
Before landing the lead role in &quot;Alias&quot;, Garner auditioned five times for a guest appearance in J. J. Abrams&#x27;s &quot;Felicity&quot;. When Abrams created &quot;Alias&quot;, he wanted Garner to portray Sydney. &quot;There was something about her that I just thought was really special. I always thought she had something in her personality that was funnier and sexier and smarter and more mischievous than anything I&#x27;d seen her do. And when I wrote Sydney, I wanted to show that,&quot; he said. Melissa George, who went on to play Lauren Reed on the show, was also considered for the role of Sydney. Garner took private martial arts lessons for one month during the audition process. She did many of the physical stunts herself throughout the series. Her first stunt double was Dana Hee, who was later replaced by Shauna Duggins.

==Reception==

As of 2004, Sydney was named one of the 10 best current characters by &quot;Zap2it&quot;. In June 2010, she was ranked No. 42 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years&quot;. UGO.com ranked her the 20th Top TV Character out of 50. Sydney was listed AOL TV&#x27;s &quot;100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters&quot;, ranking at No. 27. and AfterEllen.com&#x27;s Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. Bristow also appeared in &quot;Maxim&quot; list of the Hottest Nerd Crushes. She was also included in &quot;Total Sci-Fi Online&quot;″s list of &quot;The 25 Women Who Shook Sci-Fi&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; named her one of TV&#x27;s Toughest Ladies. Her relationship with Michael Vaughn was featured in &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s list of the best TV couples of all time.

Garner also received critical acclaim for her performance. She won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama out of four consecutive nominations, as well as four Emmy nominations for her lead performance. She was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series in 2004 and she won the award in 2005.

In August 2003, the actual CIA enlisted Jennifer Garner to appear in a recruitment video, which would be shown at fairs and college campuses. A CIA officer said: &quot;Jennifer and the character of Sydney Bristow both reflect a lot of the qualities we look for in new career field officers.&quot;

<text>In physics and physical chemistry, time-resolved spectroscopy is the study of dynamic processes in materials or chemical compounds by means of spectroscopic techniques. Most often, processes are studied after the illumination of a material occurs, but in principle, the technique can be applied to any process that leads to a change in properties of a material. With the help of pulsed lasers, it is possible to study processes that occur on time scales as short as 10−16 seconds. All time-resolved spectra are suitable to be analyzed using the two-dimensional correlation method for a correlation map between the peaks.

==Transient-absorption spectroscopy==
Transient-absorption spectroscopy (TAS), also known as flash photolysis, is an extension of absorption spectroscopy. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, an example of non-linear spectroscopy, measures changes in the absorbance/transmittance in the sample. Here, the absorbance at a particular wavelength or range of wavelengths of a sample is measured as a function of time after excitation by a flash of light. In a typical experiment, both the light for excitation (&#x27;pump&#x27;) and the light for measuring the absorbance (&#x27;probe&#x27;) are generated by a pulsed laser. If the process under study is slow, then the time resolution can be obtained with a continuous (i.e., not pulsed) probe beam and repeated conventional spectrophotometric techniques.

Time-resolved absorption spectroscopy relies on the ability to resolve two physical actions in real time. The shorter the detection time, the better the resolution. As a result, femtosecond laser spectroscopy offers better resolution than nanosecond laser spectroscopy. In a typical experimental set up, a pump pulse excites the sample and later, a delayed probe pulse strikes the sample. In order to maintain the maximum spectral distribution, two pulses are derived from the same source. The impact of the probe pulse on the sample is recorded and analyzed with wavelength/ time to study the dynamics of the excited state.

Absorbance (after pump) – Absorbance (before pump) = ΔAbsorbance

ΔAbsorbance records any change in the absorption spectrum as a function of time and wavelength. As a matter of fact, it reflects ground state bleaching (-ΔA), further excitation of the excited electrons to higher excited states (+ΔA), stimulated emission (-ΔA) or product absorption (+ΔA). Bleaching of ground state refers to depletion of the ground state carriers to excited states. Stimulated emission follows the fluorescence spectrum of the molecule and is Stokes shifted relative to and often still overlaps with the bleach signal. This is a lasing effect (coherent emission) of the excited dye molecules under the strong probe light. This emission signal cannot be distinguished from the absorption signal and often gives false negative Δ absorbance peaks in the final spectra that can be decoupled via approximations. Product absorption refers to any absorption changes caused due to formation of intermediate reaction products. TA measurements can also be used to predict non emissive states and dark states unlike time resolved photoluminescence.

Transient absorption can be measured as a function of wavelength or time. The TA curve along wavelength provides information regarding evolution/decay of various intermediate species involved in chemical reaction at different wavelengths. The transient absorption decay curve against time contains information regarding the number of decay processes involved at a given wavelength, how fast or slow the decay processes are. It can provide evidences with respect to inter-system crossing, intermediate unstable electronic states, trap states, surface states etc.

=== Spectral Resolution of Transient Absorption ===
Transient absorption is a highly sensitive technique that can provide insightful information regarding chemical and material processes when achieving sufficient spectral resolution.  Beyond the obvious consideration of a sufficiently short pulse width, the dependence of the frequency bandwidth must be accounted for. The equation 

ΔνΔt ≥ K

demonstrates that, for any beam shape (K), the beam bandwidth (Δν) is inversely proportional to its pulse width. Therefore, a compromise must be made to achieve maximum resolution in both the time and frequency domains.

The use of high-power lasers with ultrashort pulse widths can create phenomena that obscure weak spectral data, commonly referred to as artifacts. Examples of artifacts include the signal resulting from two-photon absorption and stimulated Raman amplification. Two-photon absorption occurs in samples that are generally transparent to UV-Vis wavelengths of light. These media are able to absorb light efficiently when simultaneously interacting with multiple photons. This causes a change in intensity of the probe pulse.

ΔIprobe = γIpumpIprobeL

The above equation describes the change in intensity relative to the number of photons absorbed (γ) and the thickness of the sample (L). The change in absorption signal resulting from this event has been approximated to the below equation.

Sapprox = 0.43∙IprobeIref

A common baseline correction technique used in spectroscopy is the penalized root mean square error. A variant of this technique, the asymmetric penalized root mean square, has been used to correct signals affected by artifacts in transient absorption.

===Conditions===
TA measurements are highly sensitive to laser repetition rate, pulse duration, emission wavelength, polarization, intensity, sample chemistry, solvents, concentration and temperature. The excitation density (no. of photons per unit area per second) must be kept low; otherwise, sample annihilation, saturation and orientational saturation may come into play.

===Application===
Transient absorption spectroscopy helps study the mechanistic and kinetic details of chemical processes occurring on the time scales of few picoseconds to femto-seconds. These chemical events are initiated by an ultrafast laser pulse and are further probed by a probe pulse. With the help of TA measurements, one can look into non-radiative relaxation of higher electronic states (~femtoseconds), vibrational relaxations (~picoseconds) and radiative relaxation of excited singlet state (occurs typically on nanoseconds time scale).

Transient absorption spectroscopy can be used to trace the intermediate states in a photo-chemical reaction; energy, charge or electron transfer process; conformational changes, thermal relaxation, fluorescence or phosphorescence processes, optical gain spectroscopy of semiconductor laser materials. etc. With the availability of UV-Vis-NIR ultrafast lasers, one can selectively excite a portion of any large molecule to desired excited states to study the specific molecular dynamics.

Transient absorption spectroscopy has become an important tool for characterizing various electronic states and energy transfer processes in nanoparticles, to locate trap states and further helps in characterizing the efficient passivation strategies.

==Other multiple-pulse techniques==

Transient spectroscopy as discussed above is a technique that involves two pulses. There are many more techniques that employ two or more pulses, such as:
* Photon echoes.
* Four-wave mixing (involves three laser pulses)
* fifth-order experiments (involves four excitation pulses and a probe pulse)

The interpretation of experimental data from these techniques is usually much more complicated than in transient-absorption spectroscopy.

Nuclear magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance are often implemented with multiple-pulse techniques, though with radio waves and micro waves instead of visible light.

==Time-resolved infrared spectroscopy==

Time-resolved infrared (TRIR) spectroscopy also employs a two-pulse, &quot;pump-probe&quot; methodology. The pump pulse is typically in the UV region and is often generated by a high-powered , whereas the probe beam is in the infrared region. This technique currently operates down to the picosecond time regime and surpasses transient absorption and emission spectroscopy by providing &quot;structural&quot; information on the excited-state kinetics of both dark and emissive states.

==Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy==

Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy is an extension of fluorescence spectroscopy. Here, the fluorescence of a sample is monitored as a function of time after excitation by a flash of light. The time resolution can be obtained in a number of ways, depending on the required sensitivity and time resolution:
* With fast-detection electronics (nanoseconds and slower)
* With Time Correlated Single Photon Counting, TCSPC (picoseconds and slower)
* With a streak camera (picoseconds and slower)
* With intensified CCD (ICCD) cameras (down to 200 picoseconds and slower)
* With optical gating (femtoseconds-nanoseconds) - a short laser pulse acts as a gate for the detection of fluorescence light; only fluorescence light that arrives at the detector at the same time as the gate pulse is detected. This technique has the best time resolution, but the efficiency is rather low. An extension of this optical gating technique is to use a &quot;Kerr gate&quot;, which allows the scattered Raman signal to be collected before the (slower) fluorescence signal overwhelms it. This technique can greatly improve the signal:noise ratio of Raman spectra.
This technique uses convolution integral to calculate a lifetime from a fluorescence decay.

==Time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and 2PPE==

Time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and two-photon photoelectron spectroscopy (2PPE) are important extensions to photoemission spectroscopy. These methods employ a pump-probe setup. In most cases the pump and probe are both generated by a pulsed laser and in the UV region. The pump excites the atom or molecule of interest, and the probe ionizes it. The electrons or positive ions resulting from this event are then detected. As the time delay between the pump and the probe are changed, the change in the energy (and sometimes emission direction) of the photo-products is observed. In some cases multiple photons of a lower energy are used as the ionizing probe.

<text>Harry Carlyle Liscombe (May 17, 1914 – February 24, 2004) was a Canadian ice hockey player. He played in the National Hockey League with the Detroit Red Wings between 1937 and 1946. With Detroit he won the Stanley Cup in 1943. He also won the Calder Cup with the Providence Reds of the American Hockey League in 1949. Liscombe was the last surviving member of Red Wings 1943 Stanley Cup team.

==Playing career==
Liscombe was a key member of the 1943 Stanley Cup champions. After scoring 42 points during the regular season, he tied a league record with 14 points in the playoffs. He scored the last goal of the 1943 Stanley Cup Finals.

After co-leading the NHL across two playoff seasons with 26 points (12 points in 1942 and 14 points in 1943), Liscombe scored a career-high 73 points in 50 games during the 1943-44 regular season (fourth-best in the league scoring race).

Liscombe shares the team record for most goals in a playoff game and most points in a game.

Liscombe was also a star in the American Hockey League, notably becoming the first back-to-back winner of the Les Cunningham Award as the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. In 1949, Liscombe helped the Providence Reds win the Calder Cup.

Liscombe died of complications from leukemia.

<doc id="517996" wikidata="Q1145705" url="?curid=517996" title="Decalcomania">
<text>Decalcomania (from ) is a decorative technique by which engravings and prints may be transferred to pottery or other materials. 

A shortened version of the term is used for a mass-produced commodity, art transfer, or product label, known as a &quot;decal&quot;.

Decalcomania is adapted from French , equivalent to , &quot;to transfer a tracing of&quot;, plus English &quot;-mania&quot;. The verb &quot;&quot; is based on Italian , &quot;to stomp, trample&quot;, ultimately from Latin , &quot;heel&quot;. Decalcomania was first recorded in English in the early 1860s.

==History==

Decalcomania was first used commercially in England about 1750 and imported into the United States at least as early as 1865. Its invention has been attributed to Simon François Ravenet (1706–1774), an engraver from France who later moved to England and perfected the process, which he called &quot;&quot; (derived from French , &quot;tracing paper&quot;). The first known use of the French term , in Mary Elizabeth Braddon&#x27;s &quot;Eleanor&#x27;s Victory&quot; (1863), was followed by the English &quot;decalcomania&quot; in an 1865 trade show catalog (&quot;The Tenth Exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association&quot;); it was popularized during the ceramic transfer craze of the mid-1870s. By around 1875 decalcomania designs printed in colored glazes were being applied to porcelain, an extension of transfer printing, which had been developed in England since the late 18th century. The decalcomania was applied over an already glazed surface and re-fired. The process began to be mechanized from the turn of the 20th century.

==Artists==
The surrealist Óscar Domínguez referred to his work as &quot;decalcomania with no preconceived object&quot;. He took up the technique in 1936, using gouache spread thinly on a sheet of paper or other surface (glass has been used), which is then pressed onto another surface such as a canvas. Domínguez used black gouache, though colours later made their appearance.

German artist Max Ernst also practiced decalcomania, as did Hans Bellmer and Remedios Varo.

French surrealist Yves Tanguy used the technique in his 1936 works &quot;Paysage I&quot; and &quot;Paysage II&quot;, which were included in the Guggenheim Museum&#x27;s exhibition &quot;Surrealism: Two Private Eyes&quot; (4 June – 12 September 1999, New York).

American visual artist Perry Hall has created hundreds of paintings solely through the use of decalcomania and has developed variations on the technique. Hall sees decalcomania as the way in which the material of paint &quot;self organizes&quot; when pressurized, with paint forming into intricate inner-locking networks of ridges and line that bifurcate, splitting and reassembling into complex structures—a kind of physical &quot;fractal&quot; network. The bifurcating systems created with decalcomania in his paintings resemble structures seen in nature: the branching of trees, crystalline structures, networks of capillaries and veins, as well as the forms seen in river deltas and sand dunes.

==Fractals==
The production of decalcomanias has not been confined to art. At Yale University, fingerpaint decalcomanias have been analysed for their tendency to generate fractals when the process is repeated several times on the same paper.

<text>USS &quot;Sargo&quot; (SS-188), the lead ship of her class of submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sargo fish.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Sargo&quot;′s keel was laid on 12 May 1937 by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 6 June 1938, sponsored by Mrs. Catherine V. Nimitz, the wife of Captain (later Fleet Admiral) Chester W. Nimitz, and commissioned on 7 February 1939.

==Sargo batteries==

The &quot;Sargo&quot; was the first vessel equipped with a new lead-acid battery designed by the Bureau of Steam Engineering (BuEng) to resist battle damage, based on a suggestion by her commissioning commanding officer, Lieutenant E. E. Yeomans. It quickly became known as the &quot;Sargo battery&quot;. Instead of a single hard rubber case, it had two concentric hard rubber cases with a layer of soft rubber between them. This was to prevent sulfuric acid leakage in the event one case cracked during depth-charging. Leaking sulfuric acid would be capable of corroding steel, burning the skin of crew members it came into contact with, and if mixed with any seawater in the bilges it would generate poisonous chlorine gas. This remained the standard battery design until replaced with Sargo II and GUPPY batteries in submarines upgraded under the Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program after World War II. Each battery&#x27;s capacity was slightly increased by installing 126 cells instead of 120; this also raised the nominal voltage from 250 volts to 270 volts, which has been standard in US usage ever since, including the backup batteries of nuclear submarines.

==Pre-war service==
After shakedown along the eastern seaboard of South America, &quot;Sargo&quot; departed Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in July 1939 for duty with the Pacific Fleet. Transiting the Panama Canal, she arrived at San Diego, California, in mid-August. She operated in the eastern and mid-Pacific for the next two years, including a practice 40-day war patrol between Midway Island and the Marshall Islands in the fall of 1941. She departed Pearl Harbor on 23 October 1941, arrived in Manila on 10 November, and was there when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December.

==War patrols under Tyrell D. Jacobs==
The next day (under the command of the torpedo specialist Lieutenant Commander Tyrell D. Jacobs, Annapolis Class of 1927), This submarine got underway for her first war patrol, one that took her along the east coast of French Indochina and to the Netherlands East Indies. Off the major Japanese base at Cam Ranh Bay,  intercepts directed her to three cruisers on 14 December, but the &quot;Sargo&quot; was unable to gain position to attack when they appeared as scheduled. Expecting a convoy, she went in closer, and that night detected a freighter, firing one torpedo; it prematured eighteen seconds later. Confidence in the Mark VI torpedo exploder shaken, she switched to contact pistol afterward.

On 24 December, she found two freighters, firing two torpedoes at one, one at the other, from about , scoring no hits. Temporarily losing depth control, she broached, and the target turned away; &quot;Sargo&quot; fired two stern tubes at , with no more success. The next day, she sighted a pair of merchantmen, but was unable to gain firing position. Some time afterward, she came on two more merchantmen and fired two stern torpedoes at the rearmost of them, from closer yet, ; both again missed. By now frustrated, after eight torpedoes with zero results, when two additional merchantmen came in view an hour later, &quot;Sargo&quot; took extra pains to get it right, pursuing for fifty-seven minutes and making certain TDC bearings matched perfectly before firing two torpedoes at each ship, at an average of 1000 yards; all missed.

After her skipper discovered the torpedoes were running too deep, and correcting the problem, &quot;Sargo&quot; detected a target at dusk on 26 December losing, then regaining, contact, and running ahead, so be able to get good position. Then weather intervened, and the ships escaped.

A few days afterward, a big, slow tanker gave &quot;Sargo&quot; another opportunity, and again, the approach was meticulous, firing one torpedo at a close . It missed. In exasperation, &quot;Sargo&quot; signaled headquarters, questioning the Mark 14&#x27;s reliability on an open radio circuit.

On 20 January 1942, she assisted in the rescue of the crew of &quot;S-36&quot; after she ran aground on Taku Reef in the Makassar Strait. &quot;Sargo&quot; remained surfaced, relaying distress messages to friendly aircraft and surface ships. After the rescue by the Dutch merchant ship &quot;Siberote&quot;, &quot;Sargo&quot; headed for Java, and arrived at Soerabaja on 25 January.

Here, she offloaded all her reload torpedoes (keeping only those in her tubes) and three-inch ammunition, and took on one million rounds of .30-caliber ammunition desperately needed by Allied forces in the Philippines. She sortied 5 February, avoiding the usual traffic lanes, and arrived in Polloc Harbor nine days later. After delivering her vital cargo to Mindanao, she returned to Soerabaja with 24 Boeing B-17 specialists from Clark Field on board.

Sailing from Soerabaja with 31 passengers from Java on 25 February, she headed for Australia. On 4 March 1942 she was one day out of Fremantle, Western Australia, when a Royal Australian Air Force Lockheed Hudson patrol bomber mistook her for a Japanese submarine and attacked her at 13:38 while she was on the surface at . As she crash-dived, two bombs exploded as she reached a depth of and lifted her stern out of the water. She went out of control and plunged to a depth of before her crew could stop her dive, then rose rapidly and broached spectacularly. She again submerged, and a second pair of bombs exploded. One of them detonated over her conning tower as she passed a depth of , destroying the optics in both of her periscopes, damaging her conning tower door, conning tower upper hatch, and most of her lights and gauges, and knocking out all electrical power for 90 seconds. She remained submerged until after nightfall and arrived safely at Fremantle on 5 March 1942.

==War patrols under Richard V. Gregory==

During March, amid the panic over potential Japanese invasion of Australia, &quot;Sargo&quot; (now commanded by Richard V. Gregory, Class of 1932) was detailed to guard Darwin&#x27;s approaches. Nothing materialized.

On 8 June, &quot;Sargo&quot; put to sea for her fourth patrol, conducted in the Gulf of Siam off Malaya. She attacked only one target, a small tanker, with only three torpedoes, but failed to score, then returned to Australia on 2 August.

The fifth war patrol, from 27 August to 25 October, was in the Celebes Sea and South China Sea. In a submerged attack off Vietnam, French Indochina, on 25 September, she fired two torpedoes at the 4,472-ton cargo ship &quot;Teibo Maru&quot;. When these did not sink the target, three more were fired; all missed, including one circular, which exploded off her stern, presaging another deadly failing of the Mark 14. &quot;Sargo&quot; then surfaced and finished off the crippled freighter with gunfire.

==War patrols under Edward S. Carmick==
On 29 November, she departed Brisbane and conducted her sixth patrol (now commanded by Edward S. Carmick, Class of 1930) &quot;en route&quot; to Hawaii. On the last day of 1942, she made a submerged attack on an enemy tanker off Tingwon Island, firing a spread of four torpedoes. Heavy explosions were heard, accompanied by grinding noises usually associated with a ship breaking up. JANAC did not confirm the sinking. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 21 January 1943 and proceeded to San Francisco Bay for a three-month overhaul in the Mare Island Navy Yard.

Returning to Hawaii on 10 May, she departed on 27 May for her seventh patrol which took her to the Truk-Guam-Saipan shipping lanes. On 13 June, she intercepted a three-ship convoy, escorted by a subchaser. That night, she made a submerged attack, sinking the passenger-cargo ship &quot;Konan Maru&quot; southeast of Palau. The next day, she fired torpedoes at another of the cargo ships but could not learn the results of her attack, since she was forced to dive to escape the subchaser&#x27;s depth charges. &quot;Sargo&quot; arrived at Midway Island on 9 July, where she was credited with one ship sunk for 6,600 tons (reduced postwar to 5,200).

She departed Midway on 1 August for her eighth war patrol, again at Truk and in the Mariana Islands. She made no contacts and returned to Pearl Harbor on 15 September for refit.

==War patrols under Philip W. Garnett and post-war fate==
On her ninth war patrol (now commanded by Philip W. Garnett, Class of 1933), 15 October to 9 December, &quot;Sargo&quot; operated off Formosa and in the Philippine Sea. On 9 November, she torpedoed the cargo ship, &quot;Tago Maru&quot;, southeast of Formosa, and finished off the stricken ship with gunfire. Steaming north, she torpedoed and sank the passenger ship, &quot;Kosei Maru&quot; two days later east of Okinawa. Afterwards, she picked up a Japanese soldier, clinging to floating debris, survivor of another sinking. &quot;Sargo&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 9 December 1943, credited with two ships for 15,900 tons; postwar, it was 6,400.

&quot;Sargo&quot;’s tenth patrol, 26 January to 12 March 1944, was conducted north of the Palau Islands. Despite alerting her, she failed to be in position to intercept Admiral Koga when he appeared. Still, she made four attacks and fired all her torpedoes. She sank the transports &quot;Nichiro Maru&quot; (6,500 tons) on 17 February and &quot;Uchide Maru&quot; (5,300 tons) on 29 February; this time, the wartime credit, one ship of 7,000 tons, remarkably, increased.

After refit in Pearl Harbor, the veteran submarine departed on her eleventh war patrol on 7 April, along the southern coasts of Kyūshū, Shikoku, and Honshū. On 26 April, she torpedoed and sank the cargo ship &quot;Wazan Maru&quot; in Kii Suido, approaching Osaka Bay. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 May and steamed east to the west coast of the United States for a major overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard.

Returning to Hawaii in September, &quot;Sargo&quot; got underway for her 12th patrol on 13 October and operated off the Bonin Islands and Ryukyu Islands. Two trawlers were damaged by &quot;Sargo&quot;’s three-inch (76 mm) deck gun and machine guns.

On arrival at Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands, on 7 December 1944, she was assigned to training submarine crews until 13 January 1945, when she proceeded to Eniwetok Atoll. There she acted as a target for ASW training. As the war ended, she returned &quot;via&quot; Hawaii to the United States, arriving at Mare Island on 27 August. Decommissioned on 22 June 1946, she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 July 1946. Her hulk was sold for scrap on 19 May 1947 to the Learner Company of California.

<doc id="518002" wikidata="Q11312736" url="?curid=518002" title="USS Spearfish">
<text>USS &quot;Spearfish&quot; (SS-190), a &quot;Sargo&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the spearfish, any of several large, powerful, pelagic fishes of the genus &quot;Tetrapturus&quot; allied to the marlins and sailfishes.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Spearfish&quot;′s keel was laid down on 9 September 1937 by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 29 October 1938, sponsored by Mrs. Lillian Spear, wife of Lawrence Y. Spear, president of Electric Boat Company. &quot;Spearfish&quot; was commissioned on 17 July 1939.

==Pre-World War II service==

&quot;Spearfish&quot; conducted sea trials off New London, Connecticut, and then held her shakedown cruise in the Guantanamo Bay area from 21 August to 3 October. She was overhauled at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, from 1 November 1939 to 2 February 1940. On 10 February, she set sail for the West Coast. After training operations in the San Diego, California, training area from 6 March to 1 April, the submarine sailed to Pearl Harbor.

==First and second war patrols==

&quot;Spearfish&quot; operated between Hawaii and the West Coast until 23 October 1941, when she departed Pearl Harbor and headed for Manila. She conducted training operations there from 8 November until the outbreak of war on 8 December (7 December east of the International Date Line), when she began her first war patrol. This mission took her into the South China Sea, near Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay, French Indochina, and off Tarakan and Balikpapan, Borneo. On 20 December, &quot;Spearfish&quot; encountered a Japanese submarine and made a submerged attack. She fired four torpedoes, but all missed the target. She put into Surabaja, Java, on 29 January 1942 for refitting.

On 7 February, she began her second war patrol. &quot;Spearfish&quot; patrolled in the Java Sea and Flores Sea and made unsuccessful torpedo attacks on two cruiser task forces. On 2 March, she put into Tjilatjap, Java, and took on board 12 members of the staff of the commander of the submarines of the Asiatic Fleet, for transportation to Australia. The patrol ended at Fremantle, Western Australia.

==Third-sixth war patrols==

Her third war patrol, from 27 March to 20 May, took her to the Sulu Sea and Lingayen Gulf. On 17 April, she sank an enemy cargo ship of about 4,000 tons, and on 25 April, she sank &quot;Toba Maru&quot;, a 6,995-ton freighter. 

On the night of 3 May, the submarine slipped into Manila Bay and picked up 14 nurses, and several staff officers from Corregidor. She was the last American submarine to visit that beleaguered fortress before it surrendered. Navy nurse and Legion of Merit recipient Ann A. Bernatitus was among the 27 rescued by &quot;Spearfish&quot;.

From 26 June to 17 August, she scouted the South China Sea for enemy shipping, and from 8 September to 11 November, searched the west coast of Luzon, where she damaged two freighters.

&quot;Spearfish&quot; sailed from Brisbane on 2 December 1942 and patrolled in the New Britain-New Ireland area for over a month before entering Pearl Harbor on 25 January 1943. From Oahu, she was directed to Mare Island for a major overhaul, which lasted from 3 February to 19 May.

==Seventh-ninth war patrols==

&quot;Spearfish&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 May, and began her seventh war patrol from there on 5 June. She cruised the Truk Island area, made a photographic reconnaissance of Eniwetok Atoll, and then patrolled in the vicinity of Marcus Island. After refitting at Midway Island from 1 August to 25 August, &quot;Spearfish&quot; searched Japanese home waters south of Bungo Suido for shipping. On the night of 10 and 11 September, she made a submerged torpedo attack on a convoy of seven freighters escorted by one destroyer and two torpedo boats. The submarine fired torpedoes at four ships, and damaged two. &quot;Spearfish&quot; was attacked with depth charges throughout the day, but finally eluded the escorts. On the night of 17 and 18 September, she attacked another convoy of seven ships with their escorts, sinking two and damaging one. Upon concluding this patrol, the ship sailed to Pearl Harbor for refitting.

From 7 November to 19 December, &quot;Spearfish&quot; performed photographic reconnaissance of Jaluit, Wotje, and Kwajalein, Marshall Islands, to aid the coming invasion of those islands. On 5 and 6 December, she acted as lifeguard submarine for air strikes on Kwajalein and Wotje.

==Tenth-twelfth war patrols==

&quot;Spearfish&quot;’s 10th war patrol was made south of Formosa from 17 January to 29 February 1944. On 30 January, she made two torpedo attacks on a convoy of three merchantmen and two escorts. She sank an escort and the passenger-cargo ship, &quot;Tomashima Maru&quot;. On 10 February, her attack on a convoy of four ships and their escorts damaged a freighter and sank a transport. The next day, she damaged another freighter in an 11-ship convoy. On 12 February, she crippled another freighter.

&quot;Spearfish&quot; sailed on her 11th war patrol from Pearl Harbor, 31 March, for the East China Sea and the area north of Nansei Shoto. On 5 May, she sank a freighter, and the following day, she sank the cargo ship, &quot;Toyoura Maru&quot;. When the submarine returned to Pearl Harbor on 27 May, she was routed to the West Coast for a major overhaul. After spending from 6 June to 3 October at the Mare Island Navy Yard, the ship returned to Pearl Harbor on 10 October and held training exercises for a month.

&quot;Spearfish&quot;’s last war patrol took place from 12 November 1944 to 24 January 1945. On the first part of the patrol, she made photographic reconnaissance surveys of Iwo Jima and of Minami Jima. The submarine spent the second part in the Nanpō Islands area on lifeguard duties and offensive patrolling. She was on the surface east-southeast of Iwo Jima at at 17:15 on 28 November 1944 when a United States Army Air Forces B-24 Liberator bomber attacked her with rockets and strafed her. Her officer of the deck observed a large explosion plume from &quot;Spearfish&quot; just before she submerged.

On 19 December 1944, &quot;Spearfish&quot; rescued seven survivors (CPT Linden O. Bricker, 2LT Kenneth R. Chidester, 2LT Jay L. Meikle, 2LT Clifford B. Smith, SGT Edmund G. Smith, CPL Stephen J. Darienzo, and SSG Richard J. Grinstead) from a ditched B-29 Superfortress, Z-1 &quot;Pee Wee&quot;. Four airmen were killed during the ditching (2LT Jack O. Mueller, CPL Emory A. Forrest, CPL William F. Frank, and CPL John C. Estes). This marked the first submarine rescue of downed B-29 airmen in the Pacific theater of operations during World War II.

On 11 January 1945, &quot;Spearfish&#x27;s&quot; guns sank a &quot;sampan&quot;. She took three Japanese on board as prisoners, but one died several days later. LCDR C.C. Cole, commanding officer of the &quot;Spearfish&quot;, noted in the ship&#x27;s log at Tanapag Harbor, Saipan, on 13 January that he returned the seven airmen to their quarters under jubilant escort from their squadron.

==Fate==

When she returned to Pearl Harbor on 24 January, &quot;Spearfish&quot; was used as a training ship until 18 August. On 19 August, she got underway for the West Coast and arrived at Mare Island on 27 August. On 7 September, a Board of Inspection and Survey recommended that she be decommissioned immediately and possibly scrapped. She was retained in an inactive status for experimental explosive tests. The tests were cancelled, and &quot;Spearfish&quot; was decommissioned at Mare Island on 22 June 1946. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 July 1946, sold to the Lerner Company of Oakland, California, and scrapped in October 1947.

<text>USS &quot;Searaven&quot; (SS-196), a , was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sea raven, a sculpin of the northern Atlantic coast of America.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Searaven&quot;′s keel was aid down on 9 August 1938 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 21 June 1939, sponsored by Mrs. Julianna B. Cole, wife of Cyrus W. Cole, Commandant of the Portsmouth Navy Yard, and commissioned on 2 October 1939, with Lieutenant Thomas G. Reamy in command.

==World War II==
In the two years preceding the United States&#x27;s entry into World War II, &quot;Searaven&quot; operated in Philippine waters conducting training and maneuvers. At the outbreak of war between the United States and the Japanese Empire, the submarine was at the Cavite Navy Yard in Manila Bay. During her first two war patrols in December 1941 and the spring of 1942, she ran supplies to the American and Filipino troops besieged on the Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor Island. In a night action in the Molucca Strait on 3 February 1942, &quot;Searaven&quot; engaged a Japanese destroyer with Mark 14 torpedoes. Two official sources conflict, regarding the results of this engagement. If confirmed it would have been &quot;Searaven&quot;″s first kill of the war.

&quot;Searaven&quot; conducted her third war patrol in the vicinity of Timor Island of the Netherlands East Indies, from 2 April to 25 April 1942. On 18 April, she rescued 32 Royal Australian Air Force men from enemy-held Timor, an act for which two of her officers were awarded the Navy Cross. Five days later, fire broke out in her main power cubicle, immobilizing &quot;Searaven&quot; completely. assisted her into port in Australia.

&quot;Searaven&quot;″s fourth war patrol was a quiet one and returning from her fifth patrol, she claimed 23,400 tons sunk and 6,853 damaged. This tally, however, went unconfirmed. She ended her fifth patrol on 24 November 1942 at Fremantle, Australia, where she underwent refit. On 18 December, she got underway from Fremantle, bound for the Banda Sea, Ceram Sea, and the Palau Islands. In the Banda Sea, she welcomed the New Year by loosing a spread of three torpedoes at the minelayer . Again, the sinking claimed by &quot;Searaven&quot; went unconfirmed. Two weeks later, on 14 January 1943, the submarine pumped four torpedoes into the freighter &quot;Siraha Maru&quot; and collected her first confirmed victory. On 10 February, she sailed into Pearl Harbor and, two days later, she set out for overhaul at Mare Island, California.

She completed overhaul on 7 May 1943 and returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 May. On 7 June, &quot;Searaven&quot; departed from Pearl Harbor for her seventh patrol, this time in the Mariana Islands area. During this patrol, she reconnoitered Marcus Island, but encountered no enemy shipping. She put into Midway Island on 29 July for refit.

Her eighth war patrol began at Midway on 23 August 1943. She plied the waters off the northeastern coast of Honshū, Japan, but found no enemy ship worth a torpedo. After a month and one-half at sea, the submarine made Pearl Harbor on 6 October.

A month later, she stood out for her ninth patrol. She patrolled the Eastern Caroline Islands and, for a three-day period, operated with a coordinated attack group (&quot;wolfpack&quot;) of submarines which was used as part of the defensive screen for the Gilbert Islands operation. On 25 November, she got her second confirmed kill, sending the 10,052-ton tanker to the bottom with four torpedoes, then survived a depth charge attack from the Japanese destroyer &quot;Akigumo&quot; without damage. She sailed back into Pearl Harbor on 6 December.

&quot;Searaven&quot;″s tenth war patrol, from 17 January to 3 March 1944, was occupied by photographic reconnaissance of Eniwetok Atoll and lifeguard duty for the air strikes on the Marshall Islands, Mariana Islands, and Truk. She was involved in two friendly fire incidents during the patrol. While she was on the surface near Engebi Island on 13 February, she sighted four U.S. Navy planes she mistook for Japanese aircraft and crash-dived. The planes mistook her for a Japanese submarine, and attacked her as she submerged. &quot;Searaven&quot;′s crew heard four depth charges detonate by the time she passed a depth of . Off Eniwetok on 17 February, she submerged in accordance with instructions when she sighted an approaching U.S. Navy task force of battleships and destroyers, As the task force passed over her while she was at a depth of , one of the destroyers dropped a depth charge targeting her. She suffered no damage or casualties in either incident. She rescued three airmen during her patrol, but put into Midway on 3 March 1944 with no additional sinkings to her credit.

On 26 March, &quot;Searaven&quot; embarked upon her 11th war patrol. Her assigned area was the southern islands of the Nanpō Islands, the Bonin Islands. She made two attacks during this patrol, claimed two more sinkings, but was officially credited with none.

After a complete overhaul at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Searaven&quot; set course for the Kuril Islands area. Twelve enemy vessels were sunk during this patrol. On 21 September 1944, in a night surface attack, the submarine torpedoed and sank an unescorted Japanese freighter, &quot;Rizan Maru&quot; which had dropped behind her convoy. On the night of 25 September, &quot;Searaven&quot; engaged two trawlers, four large sampans, and four 50-ton sampans. &quot;Searaven&quot; passed down the column of eight sampans and two trawlers, abeam, engaging from one to three at a time at practically point blank range. Those that did not sink on the first pass were given another dose of the same treatment until all were destroyed.

On 1 November 1944, &quot;Searaven&quot; sailed on her final war patrol as part of a coordinated attack group which also included the submarines , , and . Operating in the South China Sea, east of Hainan Island, the submarine closed out her combat career by sinking one &quot;Heinan Maru&quot;-class transport and an &quot;Omurosan Maru&quot;-type oiler. With combat ended, &quot;Searaven&quot; was assigned target and training duties for the remainder of the war.

==Post-War==
&quot;Searaven&quot; was one of the target ships in the 1946 atomic bomb test, Operation Crossroads, at Bikini Atoll. She escaped the tests with negligible damage. The submarine was decommissioned on 11 December 1946, sunk as a target on 11 September 1948, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 21 October 1948.

<doc id="518008" wikidata="Q3665281" url="?curid=518008" title="Deer in mythology">
<text>Deer have significant roles in the mythology of various peoples located all over the world, such as object of worship, the incarnation of deities, the object of heroic quests and deeds, or as magical disguise or enchantment/curse for princesses and princes in many folk and fairy tales.

The deer also symbolizes a connection to the supernatural, the Otherworld, or the fairy realm, e.g., being a messenger or an entity&#x27;s familiar.

==In folk and fairy tales==
A deer or a doe (female deer) usually appears in fairy tales as the form of a princess who has been enchanted by a malevolent fairy or witch, such as &quot;The White Doe&quot; (French fairy tale) and &quot;The Enchanted Deer&quot; (Scottish fairy tale), or a transformation curse a male character falls under. Sometimes, it represents a disguise a prince dons to escape or to achieve a goal, e.g., What the Rose did to the Cypress (Persian fairy tale). Tale types that include a transformation into deer or hind are ATU 401, &quot;The Princess Transformed into Deer&quot; and ATU 450, &quot;Brother and Sister&quot; (male relative changed into deer; see: Brother and Sister, German fairy tale; The Golden Stag, Romanian fairy tale).

A deer also appears as a helper, such as in Italian fairy tale &quot;The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird&quot;, as a foster mother to the exposed twin children; or in Portuguese folktale &quot;The Hind of the Golden Apple&quot;, as a talking animal who gifts the hero with the titular golden apple. It also may appear as a disguised adversary (an ogre, a sorcerer), e.g., in &quot;The Enchanted Doe&quot; (Italian literary fairy tale), or as a malevolent seductress, e.g., in Indian fairy tale &quot;The Son of Seven Queens&quot;, collected by Joseph Jacobs.

The deer also appears as a character in animal fables, e.g., &quot;The Deer without a Heart&quot; (Indian fable) and &quot;The Stag at the Pool&quot; (attributed to Aesop). Another cervine animal, the stag, appears in an etiological tale from Brazil (&quot;Why the Tiger and the Stag hate each other&quot;).

There&#x27;s also a Chinese short film made by Ink Wash Animation in 1963 titled Deer Girl based on mythology about a white doe who gave birth to a girl after drinking divine water.

==Buddhism==
In one of the Jataka tales, Buddha has reincarnated into the form of a deer. This story has many incarnations and names itself: such as &quot;The Story of Ruru Deer&quot;, &quot;The Golden Deer&quot;, and the Chinese cartoon &quot;A Deer of Nine Colors&quot;. The story originated in India around the 4th century BCE. The narrative hails the merits of compassion, empathy, and karma.

==Celtic==

The Insular Celts have stories involving supernatural deer, deer who are associated with a spiritual figure, and spirits or deities who may take the form of deer.

In some Scottish and Irish tales deer are seen as &quot;fairy cattle&quot; and are herded and milked by a tutelary, benevolent, otherworldly woman (such as a &quot;bean sìdhe&quot; or in other cases the goddess Flidais), who can shapeshift into the form of a red or white deer. In the West Highlands, this woman of the otherworld selects the individual deer who will be slain in the next day&#x27;s hunt.

In Ireland, The &quot;Cailleach Bhéara&quot; (&quot;The Old Woman of Beare&quot;), who lives on an island off the coast of County Cork, takes the form of a deer to avoid capture, and herds her deer down by the shore. The Beare peninsula is also associated with the islands in the western sea that are the lands of the dead. Other Celtic mythological figures such as Oisín and Sadhbh also have connections to deer.

Cernunnos is a mythological figure in Continental Celtic mythology, and possibly one of the figures depicted on the Gundestrup cauldron. He has stag antlers on the top of his head. His role in the religion and mythology is unclear, as there are no particular stories about him.

==European folklore==
Medieval works of fiction sometimes contain the existence of a white deer or stag as a supernatural or mystical being in the chivalry quest (&quot;The Hunt for the White Stag&quot; motif, such as in the &quot;lai&quot; of &quot;Guigemar&quot;) and in parts of Arthurian lore, such as in the medieval poem of &quot;Erec and Enide&quot;.
Saint Giles, a Catholic saint especially revered in the south of France, is reported to have lived for many years as a hermit in the forest near Nîmes, where in the greatest solitude he spent many years, his sole companion being a deer, or hind, who in some stories sustained him on her milk. In art, he is often depicted together with that hind.

Deer figure in the founding legend of Le Puy-en-Velay, where a Christian church replaced a megalithic dolmen said to have healing powers. A local tradition had rededicated the curative virtue of the sacred site to Mary, who cured ailments by contact with the standing stone. When the founding bishop Vosy climbed the hill, he found that it was snow-covered in July; in the snowfall, the tracks of a deer around the dolmen outlined the foundations of the future church.

 Saint Hubertus (or &quot;Hubert&quot;) is a Christian saint, the patron saint of hunters, mathematicians, opticians and metalworkers, and used to be invoked to cure rabies. The legend of St Hubertus concerned an apparition of a stag with the crucifix between its horns, effecting the worldly and aristocratic Hubert&#x27;s conversion to a saintly life.

In the story of Saint Hubertus, on Good Friday morning, when the faithful were crowding the churches, Hubertus sallied forth to the chase. As he was pursuing a magnificent stag the animal turned and, as the pious legend narrates, he was astounded at perceiving a crucifix standing between its antlers, which occasioned the change of heart that led him to a saintly life. The story of the hart appears first in one of the later legendary hagiographies (&quot;Bibliotheca hagiographica Latina&quot;, nos. 3994–4002) and has been appropriated from the earlier legend of Saint Eustace (Placidus).

Later in the 6th century, the Bishop Saint Gregory of Tours wrote his chronicles about the Merovingian rulers. &quot;Historia Francorum&quot; contains the legend of King Clovis I, who prayed to Christ in one of his campaigns so he could find a place to cross the river Vienne. Considered as a divine sign, a huge deer appeared and showed where the army could pass.

In the 14th century, probably keeping some relation with Saint Eustace&#x27;s legend, the deer again appears in Christian legend. The &quot;Chronicon Pictum&quot; contains a story where the later King Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary and his brother the King Géza I of Hungary were hunting in a forest, and a deer with numerous candles on his antlers appeared to them. Saint Ladislaus told his brother that it wasn&#x27;t a deer but an angel of God, and his antlers were wings; the candles were shining feathers. He also stated his intent to build a cathedral in honor of the Holy Virgin in the place where the deer appeared.

==Germanic==
An Anglo-Saxon royal scepter found at the Sutton Hoo burial site in England features a depiction of an upright, antlered stag. In the Old English language poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, much of the first portion of the story focuses on events surrounding a great mead hall called Heorot, meaning &quot;Hall of the Hart&quot;.

In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot; the four stags of Yggdrasil are described as feeding on the world tree, Yggdrasil, and the poem further relates that the stag Eikþyrnir lives on top of Valhalla. In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, the god Freyr is having once killed Beli with an antler. In &quot;Þiðrekssaga&quot;, Sigurd is presented as having been nursed by a doe.

Andy Orchard proposes a connection between the hart Eikþyrnir atop Valhalla, the hart imagery associated with Heorot, and the Sutton Hoo scepter. Sam Newton identifies both the Sutton Hoo whetstone and the hall Heorot as early English symbols of kingship. Rudolf Simek says that &quot;it is not completely clear what role the stag played in Germanic religion&quot; and theorizes that &quot;the stag cult probably stood in some sort of connexion to Odin&#x27;s endowment of the dignity of kings.&quot;

==Greek==
In Greek mythology, the deer is particularly associated with Artemis in her role as virginal huntress. Actaeon, after witnessing the nude figure of Artemis bathing in a pool, was transformed by Artemis into a stag that his own hounds tore to pieces. Callimachus, in his archly knowledgeable &quot;Hymn III to Artemis&quot;, mentions the deer that drew the chariot of Artemis:
:&quot;in golden armor and belt, you yoked a golden chariot, bridled deer in gold.&quot;

One of the Labors of Heracles was to capture the Ceryneian Hind sacred to Artemis and deliver it briefly to his patron, then rededicate it to Artemis. As a hind bearing antlers was unknown in Greece, the story suggests a reindeer, which, unlike other deer, can be harnessed and whose females bear antlers. The myth relates to Hyperborea, a northern land that would be a natural habitat for reindeer. Heracles&#x27; son Telephus was exposed as an infant on the slopes of Tegea but nurtured by a doe.

Several figures were transformed into deer in Greek myths. The most notable among them is the hunter Actaeon, who accidentally stumbled upon Artemis one day as she was bathing naked. Artemis turned him into a stag so that he could never tell what he had seen. Actaeon bolted off only to be chased by his own hunting dogs who did not recognise their master. The dogs caught him and devoured him. In some versions of the myth, Actaeon deliberatively tried to assault the goddess.

Others include Arge, a mortal huntress who claimed that even though the stag she was chasing was as fast as the Sun, she would catch it eventually. Helios the sun-god was offended by her words, so he turned her into a hind. Two more women were turned into hinds, both at the hands of Artemis; the first Taygete so that she could escape the amorous advances of Zeus, and the second Titanis, a girl in Artemis&#x27;s own retinue, who incurred the goddess&#x27;s wrath.

==Hinduism==

In Hindu mythology, the Aitareya Upanishad tells us that the goddess Saraswati takes the form of a red deer called Rohit. Saraswati is the goddess of learning, so learned men use deer skin as clothing and mats to sit upon. A golden deer plays an important role in the epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;. While in exile in the forest, Rama&#x27;s wife Sita sees a golden deer and asks Rama and Lakshmana to get it for her. The deer is actually a rakshasa called Maricha in disguise. Maricha takes this form to lure Rama and Lakshmana away from Sita so his nephew Ravana can kidnap her.

In the Hindu epic &quot;mahabharata&quot;, the rishi Kindama dons the disguise of a male deer.

South-Indian icons of the Hindu god Shiva may be depicted holding a deer in a hand. In the iconography of Shiva&#x27;s mendicant form Bhikshatana, a deer playfully leaps near a hand of the god, who holds some grass. The deer also appears in icons of another form Kankalamurti, who is depicted similar to Bhikshatana.

==Jainism==
In Jainism, the figure Harineyameshi (considered to be the same figure in Hindu sources referred to as Naigamesha often portrayed with the head of a goat) who is associated with transferring the embryo of Mahavira, is sometimes depicted having the head of a deer.

==Hittite==
The stag was revered alongside the bull at Alaca Höyük and continued in the Hittite mythology as the protective deity whose name is recorded as &quot;dKAL&quot;. Other Hittite gods were often depicted standing on the backs of stags, such as Kurunta or fellow Anatolian (Luwian) deity Runtiya. The deer would also have a long-standing rivalry with the mountains in Hittite mythology

==Huichol==
For the Huichol people of Mexico, the &quot;magical deer&quot; represents both the power of maize to sustain the body and of the peyote cactus to feed and enlighten the spirit. Animals such as the eagle, jaguar, serpent and deer are of great importance to the Mexican indigenous cultures. For each group, however, one of these animals is of special significance and confers some of its qualities to the tribe.

For the Huichol it is the deer that holds this intimate role. The character of the Huichol tends to be light, flexible and humorous. They have avoided open warfare, neither fighting against the Spanish nor Mexican governments, but holding to their own traditions. The Huichol hunt and sacrifice deer in their ceremonies. They make offerings to the Deer of the Maize to care for their crops, and to the Deer of the Peyote to bring them spiritual guidance and artistic inspiration.

==Hungarian==
In Hungarian mythology, Hunor and Magor, the founders of the Magyar peoples, chased a white stag in a hunt. The stag lead them into unknown land that they named Scythia. Hunor and Magor populated Scythia with their descendants the Huns and the Magyars. To this day, an important emblem in Hungary is a many-antlered stag with its head turned back over its shoulder.

==Turkic==

Deer is associated with wisdom, agility, fertility and supernatural powers in Turkic mythology. In some of the early Turkic tombs, deer figurines were found.

In the Ottoman Empire, and more specifically in western Asia Minor and Thrace the deer cult seems to have been widespread and much alive, no doubt as a result of the meeting and mixing of Turkic with local traditions. A famous case is the 13th century holy man Geyiklü Baba (i.e. &#x27;father deer&#x27;), who lived with his deer in the mountain forests of Bursa and gave hind&#x27;s milk to a colleague. Material in the Ottoman sources is not scarce but it is rather dispersed and very brief, denying us a clear picture of the rites involved.

==Judaism==
The Tribe of Naphtali bore a stag on its tribal banner and was poetically described as a hind in the Blessing of Jacob.

In Jewish mythology as discussed in the Babylonian Talmud in Hullin 59b:2, a one-horned stag called the &quot;qeresh&quot; (). It is said in Hullin 59a to live in Bē-ʿIllāʾē (), a forest full of unusual animals.

==Kurdish==
The deer symbol appears in the ancient Kurdish legends. Kurdish people believe that killing a deer brings bad luck and they see the deer as a saint who belongs to God. The deer is also used as a national symbol. The Kurdistan Regional Government forbids hunting and killing deer.

==Native American==
In Native American mythology, there is the tale of the Deer Woman, a legendary creature associated with love and fertility.

==Occultism==

The spirit Furfur in The Goetia is depicted as a hart or winged hart.

==Classical music==
In 1914, Hungarian composer Béla Bartók collected two Hungarian (Székely) &quot;colinde&quot; in Transylvania. The story is of a father who has taught his nine sons only how to hunt, so they know nothing of work and spend all of their time in the forest. One day while hunting a large and beautiful stag, they cross a haunted bridge and are themselves transformed into stags. The distressed father takes his rifle and goes out in search of his missing sons. Finding a group of fine stags gathered around a spring, he drops to one knee and takes aim. The largest stag (eldest son) pleads with his father not to shoot. The father, recognizing his favorite son in the form of a stag, begs his children to come home. The stag then replies that they can never come home: their antlers cannot pass through doorways and they can no longer drink from cups, only cool mountain springs. Bartók prepared a Hungarian libretto, and in 1930 set the tale to music in his &quot;Cantata Profana&quot;. It was first performed in London in 1934, in an English translation.

==Scythian==
The Scythians had some reverence for the stag, which is one of the most common motifs in Scythian art. Possibly the swift animal was believed to speed the spirits of the dead on their way, which perhaps explains the curious antlered headdresses found on horses buried at Pazyryk (&quot;illustration at the top of this article&quot;).

==Slavic and Uralic==
In Slavic fairytales, Golden-horned deer is a large deer with golden antlers.

Golden or silver deer/elk was a popular folk character at the Urals in the 18th century. There were tales about the mythical creature called Silver Deer, also known as the elk Golden Horns and the goat Silver Hoof.

==Shinto==
Deer are considered messengers to the gods in Shinto, especially Kasuga Shrine in Nara Prefecture where a white deer had arrived from Kashima Shrine as its divine messenger. It has become a symbol of the city of Nara. Deer in Itsukushima Shrine, located in Miyajima, Hiroshima, are also sacred as divine messengers. In various parts of Northeast Japan, a deer dance called &quot;Shishi-odori&quot; has been traditionally performed as an annual Shinto ritual.

==Tupi-Guarani==
In Brazil, there is the indigenous legend of Anhanga (Anhangá). Anhangá in tupi-guarani: anhã + anga = to run + soul ( or genius). It&#x27;s a white deer, believed to have red eyes, and the protector of all animals in the florest. Anhanga can change into a man or sometimes other animals.

==Manufactured mythology==
Quintus Sertorius, while a general in Lusitania, had a tame white stag which he had raised nearly from birth. Playing on the superstitions of the local tribes, he told them that it had been given to him by the goddess Diana; by attributing all his intelligence reports to the animal, he convinced the locals that it had the gift of prophecy. (See Plutarch&#x27;s life of Sertorius and Pliny the Elder&#x27;s chapter on stags [N.H., VIII.50])

The naming of Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s ship the &quot;Golden Hind&quot; is sometimes given a mythological origin. However, Drake actually renamed his flagship in mid-voyage in 1577 to flatter his patron Sir Christopher Hatton, whose armorial bearings included the crest &quot;a hind Or.&quot; In heraldry, a &quot;hind&quot; is a doe.

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, as well as the rest of Santa Claus&#x27;s reindeer, originated as fictional but have become an integral part of Western festive legend.

<doc id="518009" wikidata="Q1113883" url="?curid=518009" title="Klingon starships">
<text>In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, the Klingon Empire makes use of several classes of starships. As the Klingons are portrayed as a warrior culture, driven by the pursuit of honor and glory, the Empire is shown to use warships almost exclusively and even their support ships, such as troop transports and colony ships, are armed for battle. This contrasts with the exploration and research vessels used by Starfleet, the protagonists of the franchise. The first Klingon ship design used in &quot;The Original Series&quot;, the D7-class battlecruiser, was designed by Matt Jefferies to evoke a shape akin to that of a manta ray, providing a threatening and instantly recognizable form for viewers. The configuration of Jefferies&#x27;s design featured a bulbous forward hull connected by a long boom to a wing-like main hull with the engine nacelles mounted on each wingtip. Though a variety of Klingon ships have appeared in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, their design generally conforms to this style. Most Klingon vessels were physically built as scale models, although later computer-generated imagery was used to create the models. In recent years, many of the original studio models have been sold at auctions.

All Klingon ships are equipped with some form of sublight engine, and most of these ships are equipped with superluminal propulsion technology called warp drive. Klingon vessels are usually depicted as being heavily armed, equipped with particle beam weapons called disruptors and photon torpedoes, an antimatter weapon, as primary offensive weaponry. Later Klingon ships use cloaking devices. For &quot;The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, Klingon ships were designed by Rick Sternbach to reflect technology exchanges as a result of an alliance between the Klingons and Starfleet. In the prequel television series &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Klingon ships are designed to appear more primitive than those chronologically later in the franchise. The interior of Klingon vessels is utilitarian in nature: this is intended to mimic an old submarine. Klingon ship names are usually preceded by the prefix &quot;IKS&quot;, an abbreviation for &quot;Imperial Klingon Starship&quot;.

==&quot;The Original Series&quot; era==

===D7-class===
The D7-class battlecruiser is the first Klingon starship observed in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. The vessel was designed by Matt Jefferies to be distinctive and quickly recognized by viewers. As Jefferies wanted the D7-class to appear &quot;threatening, even vicious&quot;, the design was modeled on a manta ray in both basic shape and color. The spread-wing primary hull, long neck and bulbous command module configuration of the D7-class became the basic blueprint for Klingon vessels in the later television series. Jefferies&#x27;s original model for the D7-class now resides in the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum, along with the original studio model for USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

The D7-class model was originally produced for &quot;The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;Elaan of Troyius&quot;; however, as the episodes were not aired in their production order, the vessel first appeared in &quot;The Enterprise Incident&quot;. It is shown to be armed with several disruptor banks that fire in pulses, and in the remastered version, with a torpedo launcher in the forward module. In one episode of &quot;The Animated Series&quot;, &quot;More Tribbles, More Troubles&quot;, a D7-class battlecruiser is equipped with an experimental stasis weapon, capable of paralyzing target vessels. The vessel possesses both impulse engines and warp drive, allowing for faster-than-light travel. While Klingon vessels in the television series set after &quot;The Original Series&quot; possess cloaking devices, the Klingon D7-class does not at first. This is changed after &quot;The Enterprise Incident&quot;, several D7-class battlecruisers are shown under Romulan control as the result of a technology exchange between the Romulans and the Klingons; these vessels use a cloaking device.

The appearance of the D7-class has been revisited several times in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series; an entirely new studio model was created by Greg Jein for the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot;. With an overall green hue, this model had a significantly more detailed hull in comparison to the bland gray of the original. A D7-class ship also appears in the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Prophecy&quot;; however, as a CGI model of Jein&#x27;s model was not available, the ship was instead portrayed with a CGI model of the &quot;K&#x27;t&#x27;inga&quot;-class battlecruiser. The D7-class was again revisited for the remastered version of &quot;The Original Series&quot;, in which Michael Okuda created a new CGI D7-class model, with improved hull detail and Romulan bird markings for the D7-class vessels in &quot;The Enterprise Incident&quot;. This remastered D7-class was digitally inserted into episodes earlier than their original appearances.

===&quot;K&#x27;t&#x27;inga&quot;-class===
An upgrade of the design used for the D7-class vessel, the &quot;K&#x27;t&#x27;inga&quot;-class battlecruiser was first conceived for use in the pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot;. When &quot;Phase II&quot; was abandoned, the story of the pilot was adapted for &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, where three &quot;K&#x27;t&#x27;inga&quot;-class battlecruisers are used in the opening scenes. Andrew Probert is credited as the designer of the &quot;K&#x27;t&#x27;inga&quot; model in its design patent, while the class name was given by Gene Roddenberry in his novelization of &quot;The Motion Picture&quot;. Although sharing a nearly identical configuration with the D7-class, the primary difference in the &quot;K&#x27;t&#x27;inga&quot;-class is the level of detail on the hull, enhanced to make the model appear more believable to viewers on screen. The configuration of the vessel&#x27;s impulse engines also differs from that of the D7-class. The &quot;K&#x27;t&#x27;inga&quot; model was later revisited for &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, in which Industrial Light &amp; Magic enhanced the original studio model with glowing engine nacelles and changed the color from muted gray-greens to light gray with gold accents and maroon paneling. ILM&#x27;s alterations were meant to &quot;contrast... with the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-A, which is very smooth and monochromatic and cool, while this Klingon ship is very regal and ostentatious and warm&quot;. A CGI version of the ship, with a slightly modified nacelle design, was created for the later seasons of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;; this particular model was erroneously used to represent older Klingon ships in the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Prophecy&quot; and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;Unexpected&quot;. The original studio model for the &quot;K&#x27;t&#x27;inga&quot;-class battlecruiser was later sold in a 2006 Christie&#x27;s auction for US$102,000.

The &quot;K&#x27;t&#x27;inga&quot;-class battlecruiser has similar armaments to the D7-class battlecruiser, with a photon torpedo launcher in the forward module and six disruptor cannons. In addition, the ship possesses an aft torpedo launcher and can fire a powerful disruptor beam from the forward module. The &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Flashback&quot; also shows the &quot;K&#x27;t&#x27;inga&quot;-class using concussion weapons. Unlike the D7-class, the &quot;K&#x27;t&#x27;inga&quot;-class uses a cloaking device. In &quot;The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Emissary&quot;, these ships are used as sleeper ships, which could travel for decades with its crew in suspended animation. However, the class is equipped with both impulse engines and warp drive. The class is stated to have a crew of 800 and a length of . The interior of the battlecruiser was designed by Douglas Trumbull, with the intent of appearing like &quot;an enemy submarine in World War II that&#x27;s been out at sea for too long&quot;. The &quot;K&#x27;t&#x27;inga&quot;-class is used extensively throughout the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, appearing from the first feature film set in 2273 to the closing episodes of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; set in 2375, often appearing as a ship of the line in battle scenes.

===Bird-of-Prey classes===
The Bird-of-Prey is one of the most common Klingon ships seen in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. Introduced in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;, the Bird-of-Prey has featured in five of the films and frequently appears in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. Industrial Light &amp; Magic designed and built the Bird-of-Prey for &quot;Star Trek III&quot;, assisted by the film&#x27;s director, Leonard Nimoy. In early drafts of the script, the Bird-of-Prey was to be a Romulan vessel; although this idea was later dropped, the Bird-of-Prey maintained its cloaking device as a plot point in the film and the Romulan bird feather patterns on its wings were kept. The Bird-of-Prey is the first Klingon vessel depicted with a cloaking device; all classes chronologically later in the series would also use a cloaking device. The wings of the Bird-of-Prey are able to move, lowering to attack, maintaining just above horizontal in flight mode and raising high when the ship lands. However, as the studio model&#x27;s mechanism for moving the wings broke, in later &quot;Star Trek&quot; series&#x27; episodes the wings are usually fixed in either flight mode or attack mode. This was not rectified until the creation of a CGI model for the vessel. The studio models for the Bird-of-Prey were sold in the 2006 Christie&#x27;s auction; the original model sold for US$307,200, while an enlarged wing, used for close-up shots in &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot;, was sold for US$8,400. The Boeing Bird of Prey developed by McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s Phantom Works division was named after the Klingon Bird-of-Prey.

Although several variants are seen throughout the franchise, design notes state that the Bird-of-Prey has two main classes: the &quot;B&#x27;rel&quot;-class and the &quot;K&#x27;Vort&quot;-class. Both classes used the same studio model, differing in sizes in proportion to other starships depending on variant. The &quot;B&#x27;rel&quot;-class is a scout vessel, used for espionage, skirmishes and raids, while the &quot;K&#x27;Vort&quot;-class is a light cruiser. Both classes are armed with disruptor cannons mounted on the tips of the wings and a forward torpedo launcher. Likewise, both classes are equipped with cloaking devices and are capable of impulse and warp speeds. These design notes for the show hold that with a crew of only 12 and a length of , the &quot;B&#x27;rel&quot;-class is far smaller than the &quot;K&#x27;Vort&quot;-class, which measures and possesses a crew of around 300. In its onscreen appearances, however, the Bird-of-Prey model was not scaled consistently to these notes, creating the impression of ships both far larger and smaller than the design notes intended. The interior of the Bird-of-Prey is similar to that of Douglas Trumbull&#x27;s submarine-like designs for the &quot;K&#x27;t&#x27;inga&quot;-class; some Birds of Prey are even shown with periscopes to allow the captain to personally target weapons. Despite relatively light armaments, Birds of Prey are shown to be effective craft; both the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; and USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D are destroyed in part due to the activity of Birds of Prey. Most cloak-capable &quot;Star Trek&quot; vessels are unable to use weapons when cloaked; the film &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; features a modified experimental Bird-of-Prey that appeared to be able to fire torpedoes while cloaked although later observations revealed that the ship briefly decloaked.

==&quot;The Next Generation&quot; era==

===&quot;Vor&#x27;cha&quot;-class===

The &quot;Vor&#x27;cha&quot;-class attack cruiser is a powerful Klingon vessel that debuted in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Reunion&quot;. Its combat role is stated to be comparable to that of a heavy cruiser. The &quot;Vor&#x27;cha&quot;-class is the first new Klingon ship design portrayed outside of &quot;The Original Series&quot; era, and was designed by Rick Sternbach. The studio model for the ship was built by Greg Jein. Sternbach designed the &quot;Vor&#x27;cha&quot;-class to represent the alliance between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire by &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, and consequent technology exchange and collaboration. Thus, the nacelles of the craft were created to be similar to those on Starfleet vessels, while the color was intentionally placed as a midpoint between the dark green of the Bird of Prey and the light gray of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. Sternbach&#x27;s original concept sketches for the &quot;Vor&#x27;cha&quot;-class were sold at an auction in 2003 for US$850, while a studio model for the debris of a destroyed &quot;Vor&#x27;cha&quot;-class cruiser was sold on eBay in 2006 for US$1,025.

The design of the &quot;Vor&#x27;cha&quot;-class maintains the typical Klingon configuration with a forward module supported by a thick horizontal neck running aft and spreads out into a larger secondary hull. With a crew of 1,900 and a length of , &quot;Vor&#x27;cha&quot;-class vessels are one of the largest Klingon ships in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. They are heavily armed, sporting 18 disruptor cannons as well as three photon torpedo launchers. In addition, the forward section of the cruiser is equipped with a particularly powerful disruptor beam. The ships are equipped with both warp and impulse engines, and make use of cloaking devices. In the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Return to Grace&quot;, the cruiser is stated to have enough firepower to threaten subterranean bases with orbital bombardments. The &quot;Vor&#x27;cha&quot;-class is frequently seen in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episodes depicting Klingon ships; in its earliest appearances, the class represents the flagship of the Empire, under the command of first Klingon Chancellor K&#x27;mpec and later Gowron. Later appearances use the ship as the mainstay vessel in Klingon fleet engagements.

===&quot;Negh&#x27;Var&quot;-class===
The &quot;Negh&#x27;Var&quot;-class warship is one of the largest and most heavily armed Klingon vessels seen in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. The class initially was designed by Rick Sternbach to appear as a Klingon attack cruiser for an alternate timeline in &quot;All Good Things...&quot;, the series finale of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;. Sternbach built the studio model for the vessel on top of the existing studio model for the &quot;Vor&#x27;cha&quot;-class attack cruiser. A slightly modified studio model was used in the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot;, in which the &quot;Negh&#x27;Var&quot;-class is properly introduced to the audience. A CGI version of the model was eventually produced for the &quot;Voyager&quot; series finale &quot;Endgame&quot;, incorporating elements from the models used in both &quot;All Good Things...&quot; and &quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot;. The &quot;Negh&#x27;Var&quot;-class is also used in the episodes &quot;Shattered Mirror&quot; and &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Cloak&quot; as a flagship in the Mirror Universe; this version is meant to be far larger than the prime universe &quot;Negh&#x27;Var&quot;-class, to this end a model of the underside of the vessel was created to dwarf the studio model of the USS &quot;Defiant&quot; in combat sequences. The studio model for the &quot;Negh&#x27;Var&quot;-class was sold in a 2007 auction for US$7,500.

The warship is introduced as the new flagship of the Klingon Empire in &quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot;, under command of Chancellor Gowron and General Martok. As the studio model is built upon that of the &quot;Vor&#x27;cha&quot;-class, the &quot;Negh&#x27;Var&quot;-class shares many similarities in design in relation to the vessel&#x27;s shape, color and nacelles. However, with a length of nearly and a crew of 2,500, the &quot;Negh&#x27;Var&quot;-class is substantially bigger than the &quot;Vor&#x27;cha&quot;-class. The ship is equipped with a cloaking device. The class is heavily armed, with 20 disruptor banks and four torpedo launchers, as well as a large forward disruptor cannon protruding from the forward section. The &quot;Negh&#x27;Var&quot;-class only appears in a few episodes; other than in the climactic battle of &quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot;, it is not used in any fleet battle scenes.

==&quot;Enterprise&quot; era==

===D4-class===
The D4-class battlecruiser was a proposed design for the first Klingon vessel to appear in &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The vessel was originally designed for usage in the fourth episode of the series, &quot;Unexpected&quot;. Designed by John Eaves, the D4-class was meant to represent a direct predecessor to Jefferies&#x27;s D7-class. The design was similar to that of the D7-class, closely following its configuration and shape and incorporating a more rugged and primitive construction to make the ship appear consistent with the earlier time period. Eaves&#x27;s team was able to finish the design and Foundation Imaging created a computer-generated model for the episode. However, the producers rejected the model because they disliked how the model&#x27;s windows were not prominent as they were on other ship designs, stating that it could only be used if significant changes were made to the vessel. With only a few hours before the episode&#x27;s deadline for delivery and exhausted from their recent work on &quot;Broken Bow&quot;, the pilot episode of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Eaves&#x27;s team was unable to work through the night to make the alterations. Therefore, the producers decided to use an older CGI model in its place; the only other model available was a &quot;K&#x27;t&#x27;inga&quot;-class battlecruiser made for &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. The use of the &quot;K&#x27;t&#x27;inga&quot;-class created a continuity error in the series, with the same ship design seemingly in use for 225 years. thus, the producers decided that the &quot;K&#x27;t&#x27;inga&quot;-class model would not be used again as it did not fit with &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s theme. The designers involved later voiced their regret at having to use the older model, but acknowledged that there was no alternative due to the team&#x27;s exhaustion.

===&quot;Raptor&quot;-class===
The &quot;Raptor&quot;-class is the first new Klingon ship design depicted in &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The vessel is the subject of the first-season episode &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;. Produced by Herman Zimmerman&#x27;s art department, it was the first Klingon ship to debut as a completely computer-generated model. John Eaves was responsible for developing the basic shape of the &quot;Raptor&quot;-class in concept art; Doug Drexler later refined Eaves&#x27;s sketches to create a CGI mesh using LightWave 3D. Foundation Imaging converted Drexler&#x27;s work into the final CGI model seen in the episode. Eaves&#x27;s objective was to make the craft appear more primitive than the Klingon ships later in the franchise&#x27;s chronology, with exposed piping and rugged design. Eaves stated that the design was made to look &quot;like it is made up of different pieces that are attached to one another, as opposed to a uniform shape&quot;. Several designs of various sizes were proposed before Zimmerman settled on the &quot;Raptor&quot;-class. While the vessel is lightly based on Industrial Light &amp; Magic&#x27;s Bird of Prey, Eaves attempted to make the craft appear as a precursor to the D7-class. Drexler, who worked closely with Eaves during the creation of the CGI mesh, was allowed to deal with the closer details of the model, such as the position of the shuttlebay. Drexler felt that the design held qualities of both a PT boat and a 19th-century ironclad warship. The overall style of Eaves&#x27;s design was later used as the basis for future Klingon ships in &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

Designated as a scout vessel, the &quot;Raptor&quot;-class is depicted as a stalwart vessel. Its hull, stated to be twice as thick as that of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; NX-01, can survive the pressures in the top of a gas giant&#x27;s atmosphere. Although designed by the production team as a precursor to the D7-class, the &quot;Raptor&quot;-class is far smaller; Eaves stated that his design would have had a crew of around 12. The ship is armed with two torpedo launchers and a disruptor array mounted towards the back of the ship. Like most Klingon ships, it has both impulse and warp drive. The &quot;Raptor&quot;-class only appears in one episode in the series, although its schematics are visible on several computer screens in later episodes.

===D5-class===
The D5-class cruiser is the primary Klingon capital ship used in &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Designed by John Eaves and compiled as a CGI model by Pierre Drolet of EdenFX, The D5 employed a basic Klingon battlecruiser shape: a small forward hull attached by a long, horizontal boom to a larger engineering hull, with aft-mounted impulse drive units above and two warp engines at the end of backswept pylons. The design is distinct from that of the chronologically later D7 ships by its bigger and less spherical forward hull, its larger, tapered nacelles, and engine pylons that sweep backward, not forward. The D5 was initially developed for the episode &quot;Marauders&quot; as a freighter, with visible cargo tanks on the model. This version of the ship was not held to be much of a threat to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; NX-01.

The episode &quot;Judgement&quot; introduced the battlecruiser variant at the behest of producer Rick Berman. The episode originally intended to use a D7-class battlecruiser, but Berman decided that a less advanced ship should be displayed, using the D5 designation. Thus the tanker model was modified to become the D5-class battlecruiser, and would be used for the rest of the show as this era&#x27;s most powerful Klingon ship. Unlike the tanker, the D5-class was depicted as outmatching the &quot;Enterprise&quot; by a considerable margin. The battlecruiser possessed both disruptor beams and cannons, as well as forward and aft torpedoes, and is shown as capable of orbital bombardment. The ship was heavily armoured in addition to its shielding, and was capable of warp six. The designers intended and scaled the D5-class&#x27;s onscreen appearances to be in length; however, an onscreen panel notes a length of only .

Prior to the ship&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the D5-class was alluded to in the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Once More Unto The Breach&quot;. Klingon commander Kor recalls that he commanded a D5-class ship called the IKS &quot;Klothos&quot;, an intentional reference by writer Ronald D. Moore to &quot;The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;The Time Trap&quot;. In that episode, the &quot;Klothos&quot; was depicted as a D7-class battlecruiser, the only Klingon ship design that existed at the time of production.

===Bird-of-Prey===
The Bird-of-Prey of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; era was intended as a predecessor to the Bird-of-Prey model originally designed for &quot;Star Trek III&quot;. The ship was designed by John Eaves, who used an abandoned concept for a modified Bird-of-Prey intended for &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; as his starting point. The end design submitted by Eaves drew elements from this design sketch together with the previously debuted &quot;Raptor&quot; and D5-class ships, while echoing the original Bird-of-Prey design. The final design attaches an angular forward command section to a substantive engine section via a neck, with two warp nacelles placed above the ship&#x27;s central impulse engine. Feather-patterned wings sweep downward to heavy weapons mounted on the tips. Elements from the abandoned D4-class design, such as exposed cabling, were also added to create a rougher appearing ship. The CGI model was created by Koji Kuramura at EdenFX. The Bird-of-Prey debuted in the episode &quot;The Expanse&quot; and made multiple appearances across &quot;Enterprise&quot;, used in roles such as a patrol ship or a destroyer accompanying the bigger D5-class battlecruiser. The design was intended to be long with a top speed of warp 5, and was heavily armed with several wing, neck and head mounted disruptor cannons, and fore and aft photon torpedo launchers. A large belly cannon on the underside of the ship was placed by Eaves to evoke the design of the A-10 Thunderbolt.

<text>Today&#x27;s Special is a Canadian children&#x27;s television program produced by Clive VanderBurgh at TVOntario, originally broadcasting 120 episodes from 1981 to 1987. Much of the series was set in a department store, based on Simpson&#x27;s then-flagship location in Toronto. Some store sequences were shot at the Queen Street West and Yonge Street store after hours. The show ran on TVOntario in Canada as well as Nickelodeon in the United States. Reruns of the series continued into 2000 on stations such as public television stations (most of which stopped airing by the mid-1990s) in the United States and on Treehouse TV in Canada.

== Premise ==
In the children&#x27;s department of a major department store, each night when Jodie arrives for work, she carries a mannequin (Jeff) upstairs, where Muffy the mouse says the magic words &quot;hocus pocus alimagocus!&quot; This brings him to life.

Many early episodes focused on a tangible object as a subject, such as hats or costumes, with the show revolving around teaching about it. Later episodes dealt with more complicated ones, such as the episode &quot;Wishes&quot; dealing with sacrificing one thing for another, &quot;Butterflies&quot;, which deals with death, or &quot;Phil&#x27;s Visit&quot;, which dealt with alcoholism.

Short films, often less than a minute long, were often inserted as breaks in the episode&#x27;s main plot, narrated by Robyn Hayle (the same actor who provided the voice of TXL). These included Mime Lady segments, animated quizzes designed to test a child&#x27;s observation, narrated story books, and popular nursery rhymes (which an unseen Muffy would introduce with &quot;And now I&#x27;d like to introduce a nursery rhyme by Mother Goose&quot;).

Many episodes featured one or more one-time visitors to the store. Some would cause problems for the characters, while others would befriend them and help solve their problems. These visitors included the characters&#x27; friends or family, people coming to the store to do their jobs, people brought there by magic (&quot;Treasure Hunts&quot;, &quot;The Queen of Hearts&quot;), bizarre, non-human characters (&quot;Space&quot;, &quot;Sam and the Robot&quot;), and real-life celebrities (&quot;Opera&quot;, &quot;Trash&quot;). Magic was important to many episodes, and the characters sometimes would have an adventure that involved it.

== Cast and characters ==
* Jeff (Jeff Hyslop): A retail store mannequin with a magic hat that makes him come to life when someone says &quot;hocus pocus alimagocus&quot;. If it comes off his head, he turns back into a mannequin. He can&#x27;t leave the store or he will remain a mannequin forever (he can only go outside onto the building&#x27;s roof or, in very rare episodes, when traveling by magic). Because he has not been alive for very long, he knows little about many everyday objects (at least in earlier seasons). However, he is often shown to be a fast learner, a deep thinker, and a source of ideas. He is also a very talented singer and dancer, which he demonstrates at some point in nearly every episode. Though he wishes that he were not bound by the rules of the spell that keeps him alive, he puts his friends&#x27; needs first.
* Jodie (Nerene Virgin): The store&#x27;s display designer. Portrayed as a sweet, level-headed woman, she functions as a mentor and teacher to Jeff, who is relatively new to the world. He often works as her assistant in setting up the displays. Although she has no established authority, she usually takes a leadership role among the characters. Her words are often comforting to others, and she is always ready to help her friends with their problems.
* Sam Crenshaw (puppet, Bob Dermer): The store&#x27;s security guard. Born in 1919, he is the oldest of the four main characters and is a navy veteran. He is a generally laid-back individual, as the years have worn him down. He often fails to notice or realize certain things around him at first, though when he does, he is known to get hysterical about it. Sam does not seem particularly bright and is sometimes clumsy, but he means well and is capable in his job. He also has a pet cat named Penelope that Muffy is afraid of. He sometimes uses the TXL Series 4 computer to mind the store.
* Muffy Mouse (puppet, Nina Keogh): A mouse who speaks in rhyme and lives in the store all the time. She plays the piano, rides a scooter, and wears a feather boa around her neck like a lasso. She also plays tricks on people, and enjoys mischievous acts. As a mouse, she is obsessed with cheese and other snacks. Muffy is young and naive, and her fear of cats makes mention of them a pet peeve. She is usually the first one to get upset or frustrated over a situation, and her cousin, Mort, visits her on occasion. She is also Jewish. 

Recurring characters
* TXL Series 4 (Robyn Hayle): The store&#x27;s computer system. Sam operates it from the security room. It appears to have a feminine persona. Despite being a machine, it is suggested that it is capable of human emotions.
* Mrs. Pennypacker (puppet, Cheryl Wagner): An employee who runs the stock room at night. She is an elderly lady who shows her age in terms of physical appearance more than Sam does, but often appears more enthusiastic and full of energy than him. Her motto is &quot;I know where everything goes&quot; and the others sometimes call upon her knowledge of the store&#x27;s layout to find obscure or special items.
* Mort (puppet, Bob Stutt): Muffy&#x27;s cousin from the farm. His country lifestyle tends to contrast with her city life. He, like her, speaks in rhyme, and often comes to visit.
* Waldo the Magnificent (Barrie Baldaro): The magician who originally brought Jeff to life. A rather wise but somewhat inept man, the spells he casts with his wand often go awry, and it may take multiple tries to get it right. A running gag is his tendency to call Sam by the wrong name.
* The Mime Lady (Nikki Tilroe): A mime character seen in quiz segments of the show. Tilroe also provided voices for several other characters.

<text>Freddy Got Fingered is a 2001 surreal black comedy film directed by Tom Green in his feature film directorial debut and written by Bickel and Derek Harvie. The film stars Green alongside Rip Torn, Marisa Coughlan, Eddie Kaye Thomas and Julie Hagerty.

Green stars in the film as a childish slacker who wishes to become a professional cartoonist while dealing with his abusive father&#x27;s behavior. Its plot resembles Green&#x27;s struggles as a young man trying to get his television series picked up, which would later become the MTV series &quot;The Tom Green Show&quot;. The title of the film refers to a plot point where Green&#x27;s character falsely accuses his father of sexually abusing his brother, the eponymous Freddy.

Released in theaters on April 20, 2001, by 20th Century Fox, &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; was critically panned at the time of its release, with many considering it as one of the worst films of all time. It was also a box office disappointment, grossing $14.3 million worldwide, slightly above its $14 million budget. It received five Golden Raspberry Awards of its eight nominations, as well as a Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association Award for Worst Picture. However, the film quickly developed a cult following after its release on home video and has earned some positive critical re-evaluation.

==Plot==
Unemployed 28-year-old cartoonist Gordon &quot;Gord&quot; Brody leaves his parents&#x27; home in Portland, Oregon, to pursue his lifelong ambition of obtaining a contract for an animated television series. His parents, Jim and Julie, give him a Chrysler LeBaron which he drives to Los Angeles and starts work at a cheese sandwich factory to make money. Gord shows his drawings to Dave Davidson, the CEO of a major animation studio; Davidson commends the artwork but calls the concepts depicted, including a vigilante &quot;X-Ray Cat&quot;, nonsensical. Disheartened, Gord quits his job and returns to his parents.

Jim constantly insults and belittles Gord following his return, telling him to forget about being an animator and &quot;get a job&quot;. When Gord pressures his friend Darren into skating on a wooden half-pipe he has built outside the Brody home, Darren falls and breaks his leg. At the hospital, Gord impersonates a doctor, delivers a baby, and meets an attractive nurse named Betty, who uses a wheelchair, has a penchant for fellatio, and wants to create a rocket-powered wheelchair. Gord lies to his father that he has got a job in the computer industry and goes out to a restaurant with Betty, pretending he is at work.

However, Jim sees him there and disparages Betty due to her disabilities. After a fight in the restaurant, Gord is arrested and Betty bails him out. Following her advice, Gord attempts to continue drawing; however, he gets into an argument with Jim, who then smashes Gord&#x27;s half-pipe. Gord and his parents then go to a family therapy session, where Gord falsely accuses his father of fingering Gord&#x27;s younger brother, Freddy.

The 25-year-old Freddy is sent to a home for sexually molested children despite clearly being an adult. Julie, fed up with Jim&#x27;s real and perceived behavior, leaves Jim and ends up dating the basketball player Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. While in a drunken stupor, Jim tells Gord how much of a disappointment he is to him. Affected by his father&#x27;s words, Gord decides to abandon his aspirations to be a cartoonist and gets a job at a local sandwich shop.

After seeing a television news report on Betty&#x27;s successful rocket-powered wheelchair, Gord is inspired to pursue his dreams once again. He returns to Hollywood with a concept based on his relationship with his father: an adult animated series called &quot;Zebras in America&quot;. Jim follows Gord there after threatening Darren into revealing his whereabouts. While Gord is pitching the show to Davidson, Jim bursts in and trashes Davidson&#x27;s office.

Thinking Jim&#x27;s actions are part of Gord&#x27;s pitch, Davidson greenlights &quot;Zebras in America&quot; and gives Gord a million-dollar check. Gord spends a quarter of that money on an elaborate thank you to Betty for inspiring him, using a helicopter to deliver jewels to her. She thanks him but says she really only wants to perform fellatio on him. Gord spends the remainder of his windfall to relocate the Brody house to Pakistan with his father inside, unconscious—a response to Jim&#x27;s earlier put-down that &quot;If this were Pakistan, you would have been sewing soccer balls when you were four years old!&quot;

Gord and Jim soon come to terms, but are then abducted and held hostage. The kidnapping becomes a news item, as Gord&#x27;s series has already become popular. After 18 months in captivity, Gord and Jim return to the United States, where a huge crowd—including Betty, Darren, and a protestor holding a sign asking “When the fuck is this movie going to end?”—welcomes them home.

==Production==
Principal photography took place primarily in Saginaw Township and cities; Surrey, Delta (Boundary Bay Airport), Belcarra (Burrard Inlet), Port Moody (Reed Point Marina), Burnaby (Lougheed Mall) and Squamish (Squamish Airport) and in Santa Monica, California. The theatrical release is 87 minutes and received an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America following requested cuts to tone it down from an NC-17, a rating that Tom Green described as &quot;like porn with murder.&quot; As an extra on the DVD release, Green also included a version of the ending, where a small child character gets sliced by the airplane propeller, which he had edited to secure an R rating. The PG-rated cut of &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; is a mere three minutes long with a comedic voiceover. Some footage was leaked by the Newgrounds website before release. Years later, Tom Fulp, owner of Newgrounds, confirmed that the leak was a publicity stunt. Titmouse, Inc produced the animation sequences.

==Reception==

===Box office===
On a budget of $14 million, &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; grossed $14,254,993 domestically and $78,259 overseas for a worldwide total of $14,333,252, making it initially a commercial failure though it did eventually turn a profit from DVD sales. The film earned $24,300,000 from DVD sales, and was among the top 50 weekly DVD rentals chart. Green has stated in a few interviews in 2010 that DVD sales have been growing many years later and that there was a cult following. In a 2017 interview, Green stated that the box office receipts for the film did not reflect the actual attendance, as he thinks that moviegoers under the age of 17 bought tickets to &quot;Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles&quot; and then snuck into the theater showing his film.

===Critical response===

&quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; was panned upon release, with many critics considering it to be one of the worst films of all time. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 12% based on reviews from 99 critics, with an average rating of 3.20/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads &quot;Unfavorably comparing it with such infamously bad titles as &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;, a significant number of critics are calling Tom Green&#x27;s extreme gross-out comedy the worst movie they have ever seen.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 13 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; an average grade of &quot;C−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

CNN&#x27;s Paul Clinton called it &quot;quite simply the worst movie ever released by a major studio in Hollywood history&quot; and listed the running time as &quot;87 awful minutes.&quot; &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert gave the film a rare zero-star rating and listed it as one of his most hated films of all time, and described the film thus: &quot;This movie doesn&#x27;t scrape the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn&#x27;t the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn&#x27;t below the bottom of the barrel. This movie doesn&#x27;t deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels. […] The day may come when &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; is seen as a milestone of neo-surrealism. The day may never come when it is seen as funny.&quot;

Along with Ebert, his &quot;At the Movies&quot; co-host, Richard Roeper, called it &quot;horrible&quot; and expressed the view that Green was a poor comedian, going so far as to say that &quot;he should be flipping burgers somewhere&quot;. Roeper was also offended by the numerous &quot;gross-out&quot; gags. In 2003, Roeper put it on his list of his forty least favorite films of all time to that point, reiterating his dislike of Green&#x27;s comedy in general.

Film critic Leonard Maltin gave &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; a &quot;BOMB&quot; rating in his eponymous &quot;Movie Guide&quot;. He expressed views of the film similar to those of Ebert and Roeper: &quot;Instantly notorious word-of-mouth debacle became the poster child for all that&#x27;s wrong with movie comedy. ... Gags include the maiming of an innocent child and a newborn spun around in the air by its umbilical cord—compounded by the almost unimaginable ineptitude with which they&#x27;re executed.&quot;

In 2017, the film critic of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Peter Bradshaw, cited it as the worst film he had ever seen. Likewise, James Berardinelli, who had given the film a zero-star rating upon its release, said in 2008 that it was his least favourite film of all time.

David Stratton and Margaret Pomeranz of SBS&#x27; &quot;The Movie Show&quot; were not impressed by the film&#x27;s content and tone. Stratton gave the film zero stars while Pomeranz gave it one star. The magazine &quot;Complex&quot; included the film in its listicle, &quot;25 Movies That Killed Careers&quot;. A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared the film to conceptual performance art and praised it &quot;guardedly and with a slightly guilty conscience&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film received eight Golden Raspberry Award nominations in 2002, winning five. In acknowledgment of the critical consensus regarding the film&#x27;s merits, Green personally appeared at the ceremony to accept his awards, bringing his own red carpet and saying: &quot;I&#x27;d just like to say to all the other nominees in the audience: I don&#x27;t think that I deserve it any more than the rest of you. I&#x27;d like to say that; I don&#x27;t think that it would be true, though.&quot; Green would go on to play the harmonica badly for so long that he was dragged off the stage. In February 2010, it was announced that &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; was nominated for &quot;Worst Picture of the Decade&quot; for the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards but &quot;lost&quot; to &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;. &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; also garnered seven nominations at the 2001 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, five of which were wins. Following his wins, The Stinkers went ahead and designed their very own trophy for him to collect.

==Legacy==

===Later reviews===
&quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; began to see more praise over time, becoming a cult classic. Critic Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the film a rave review in his &quot;My Year of Flops&quot; column, comparing it to the work of Jean-Luc Godard and calling the film &quot;less as a conventional comedy than as a borderline Dadaist provocation, a $15 million prank at the studio&#x27;s expense&quot; adding &quot;it&#x27;s utterly rare and wondrous to witness the emergence of a dazzlingly original comic voice. I experienced that glorious sensation watching &quot;Fingered&quot;...I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve never seen anything remotely like it&quot; and rated it a &quot;Secret Success.&quot; In a later column, Rabin stated &quot;I was a little worried that I&#x27;d catch flak for giving mad props to a film as divisive and widely reviled as &quot;Freddy Got Fingered.&quot; So I was relieved to discover that every single comment agreed with my assessment of it... It also didn&#x27;t escape my attention that my &quot;Freddy&quot; post was the most commented-upon post in the history of My Year of Flops by a huge margin.&quot; Comedian Chris Rock listed &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; as one of his favorite movies on his website.

Later, in his review of the film &quot;Stealing Harvard&quot;, a film co-starring Green, Ebert wrote:
&quot;Seeing Tom Green reminded me, as how could it not, of his movie &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot;, which was so poorly received by the film critics that it received only one lonely, apologetic positive review on the Tomatometer. I gave it—let&#x27;s see—zero stars. Bad movie, especially the scene where Green was whirling the newborn infant around his head by its umbilical cord. But the thing is, I remember &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; more than a year later. I refer to it sometimes. It is a milestone. And for all its sins, it was at least an ambitious movie, a go-for-broke attempt to accomplish something. It failed, but it has not left me convinced that Tom Green doesn&#x27;t have good work in him. Anyone with his nerve and total lack of taste is sooner or later going to make a movie worth seeing.&quot;

In Green&#x27;s interview on &quot;The Opie and Anthony Show&quot;, host Gregg &quot;Opie&quot; Hughes said the film had begun to be regarded as &quot;one of the funniest movies ever made&quot;. Green said the film had sold a million copies, and that he wished to make a director&#x27;s cut due to a lot of footage not making the final cut. Green said that he was not trying to make &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; and that many fans of the movie shout out scenes from the film regularly at his stand-up performance.

&quot;Unreality Magazine&quot; featured the film in its list of &quot;10 Hilarious Movies That Received Terrible Reviews&quot;, noting that critics&#x27; taste in comedies tend not to reflect the general public. Vadim Rizov for IFC.com wrote an article titled &quot;In defense of &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot;&quot;. He calls the film one of the great underrated comedies of the decade and says the film would go on to do better if it was released today, comparing it to the successful Adult Swim series &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;.

===Director&#x27;s cut===
Green stated that he would like to do a &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; DVD release of the film in 2011 to celebrate the 10th anniversary. On March 9, 2010, on &quot;Loveline&quot;, Green announced that a director&#x27;s cut would be released. In an answer to a question from a fan on his website tomgreen.com in December 2010, Green said that there was no progress yet in regards to the director&#x27;s cut. In a Reddit &quot;Ask Me Anything&quot; (AMA) Green did on October 17, 2013, Green responded to a question regarding the release of the director&#x27;s cut with: &quot;The studio didn&#x27;t give me the footage to make the directors cut. I want to do it. If you contact New Regency or 20th Century Fox and tell them you want a directors cut maybe it will happen!&quot;

<text>A television director is in charge of the activities involved in making a television program or section of a program. They are generally responsible for decisions about the editorial content and creative style of a program, and ensuring the producer&#x27;s vision is delivered. Their duties may include selecting cast members, conduct rehearsals, work with set designers, location scouts and art directors, originating program ideas, finding contributors, writing scripts, planning &#x27;shoots&#x27;, ensuring safety, leading the crew on location, directing contributors and presenters, and working with editors and music supervisors to assemble and make sure the final product meets the producer and director&#x27;s vision. The work of a television director can vary widely depending on the nature of the program, the practices of the production company, whether the program content is factual or drama, and whether it is live or recorded.

== Types of television director ==

===Factual television director===
Factual or documentary TV directors may take any number of roles in the television production process, or combine several roles in one.

=== Entertainment television director ===
In a television show composed of individual episodes, the television director&#x27;s role may differ from a film director&#x27;s in that he or she will usually work only on some television episodes instead of being the &quot;auteur&quot; of the entire production. In an episodic television production, the major creative control will likely reside with the television producer(s) of the show. However, the director has input, whether it be how, if and why something can or cannot be done.

===Drama television director===
In a dramatic arts production, the television director&#x27;s role can be similar to a film director&#x27;s, including giving cues to actors and directing the camera placement and movement.

=== Live television director ===
Live television shows require a style in which a constant stream of instructions is given by the director as the show progresses, calling for various pre-recorded shots to be played, cueing presenters, communicating with camera and sound operators, and supervising the placement of professional video cameras (&quot;camera blocking&quot;), lighting equipment, microphones, props, graphics and the overall pacing and feel of the production. Other than quickly calling out commands, the television director liaises with the floor manager.

A news studio might have multiple cameras and few camera movements. In a sports broadcast, the director might have 20 or 30 cameras and must continuously tell each of the camera operators what to focus on.

While the director is responsible for specific shots and other production elements, the producer (typically seated behind the director in the second row of chairs in the control room) coordinates the &quot;big picture&quot;, including commercial breaks and the running length of the show.

<doc id="518023" wikidata="Q383047" url="?curid=518023" title="Wheeling Nailers">
<text>The Wheeling Nailers are a professional ECHL ice hockey team based in Wheeling, West Virginia. They are the ECHL affiliate of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League and the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the American Hockey League.

The Nailers are the oldest surviving minor league franchise below the level of the American Hockey League, with unbroken continuity of franchise and never having missed a season of play.

==Franchise history==
The Nailers began play in 1981 in the Atlantic Coast Hockey League as the Carolina Thunderbirds based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The Thunderbirds won four consecutive regular season titles and were three-time Bob Payne Trophy winners as league champions. In 1987, the ACHL folded and the team joined the All-American Hockey League for the 1987–88 season. The Thunderbirds, Virginia Lancers, and Johnstown Chiefs then became the basis for the East Coast Hockey League, now known as the ECHL. The Thunderbirds lost the first ECHL playoff championship final to the Toledo Storm. The team was renamed Winston-Salem Thunderbirds in 1990 and moved to Wheeling to become the Wheeling Thunderbirds in 1992 under the leadership of president and co-owner Ed Broyhill.

After a trademark dispute with the Seattle Thunderbirds of the Western Hockey League, the team was renamed Nailers for the 1996–97 season when the franchise held a contest open to local fans, which was won by C. J. Wickham of Steubenville, Ohio. The name &quot;Nailers&quot; was chosen for the city&#x27;s long history of nail manufacturing. For the 2012–13 season, the Nailers dropped the red-black-gold scheme they had used for nearly two decades in favor of a black-and-gold palette used by the Penguins.

The team plays at the WesBanco Arena (formerly the Wheeling Civic Center), and used the Cambria County War Memorial Arena in Johnstown, Pennsylvania as an alternative venue during the 2010–2011 and 2011-2012 seasons. After missing the playoffs for five straight seasons, they had a 106-point season in 2003–04. They were defeated by the Reading Royals in 5 games, 3–2. In season 2005–06 they had a great season making it to the second round of the playoffs losing to Toledo in the final second of the final game.

In August 2011, the Nailers moved to the Eastern Conference&#x27;s Atlantic Division as part of the league realignment for the 2011–12 season. The Chicago Express took the North Division spot vacated by the Nailers. In June 2014 the Nailers returned to the North Division after the ECHL eliminated the Atlantic Division in its realignment for the 2014–15 season.

On March 29, 2012, the ECHL announced that ownership of the Nailers would be transferred from the Brooks-owned Nailers Hockey LLC to the Hockey Club of the Ohio Valley, a joint venture of the Ohio Valley Industrial &amp; Business Development Corporation, and the Wheeling Amateur Hockey Association, to take effect at the conclusion of the 2011–2012 season.

<doc id="518028" wikidata="Q25338347" url="?curid=518028" title="Ishka">
<text>Ishka is a fictional character from the science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (&quot;DS9&quot;). A female Ferengi, she is the mother of Quark (Armin Shimerman) and Rom (Max Grodénchik). Ishka appears in five canon episodes of &quot;DS9&quot;, and also features in seven licensed-but-non-canon &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels.

Conceptualized as a feminist character, Ishka was played by Andrea Martin once and Cecily Adams four times. Both actresses endured a lot of makeup, prostheses, and costuming. Adams loved the character, and was stunned by the positive fan reaction to Ishka.

==Conception==
Ishka was conceived as a Ferengi &quot;women&#x27;s libber&quot; that Robert Hewitt Wolfe described as transcending the stereotypical protester. Ishka did not want to end the Ferengi profit-making way of life, but wanted Ferengi females to be able to take part in it. It was immediately after Ishka&#x27;s introduction in &quot;Family Business&quot; the idea of bringing her together with Grand Nagus Zek came about. René Auberjonois (Odo) even anticipated the pairing in an interview with &quot;Starlog&quot; for their January 1996 issue.

==Casting==

Director David Livingston recalled that they had a difficult time finding somebody to play Ishka; at one point, he even made the unpopular suggestion that Wallace Shawn (Grand Nagus Zek) appear in drag as Quark and Rom&#x27;s mother. Andrea Martin was cast at the suggestion of episode director René Auberjonois (Odo), who felt the actress could manage the right balance of comedy and good acting that was missing from the applicants he had seen thus far. Showrunner Ira Steven Behr agreed with Auberjonois on the casting, later saying he loved her on &quot;Second City Television&quot;. Martin was offered the role without even having to audition. Ira Behr, Robert Hewitt Wolfe, and David Livingston all had good things to say about the casting of Martin as Ishka.
When, at the last minute, Martin could not return for &quot;Ferengi Love Songs&quot;, the show held auditions for the role and saw &quot;a lot of people&quot;. Prior to auditioning, Cecily Adams was only peripherally familiar with the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, having only seen a few &quot;Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot; episodes. Adams was friends with actress Kitty Swink, and auditioned with the help of Swink&#x27;s husband Armin Shimerman (Quark); Shimerman loaned her a tape of Martin&#x27;s episode—&quot;Family Business&quot;—from which she learned &quot;how broad the character was.&quot; Adams attributed her successful audition to the many similarities between her and Martin: not only did Martin&#x27;s costumes fit without need for alteration, but so did the prosthetic faceplate. Adams was described as a &quot;natural mimic&quot; by the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion&quot;; Behr said that Adams &quot;just &quot;did&quot; Moogie.&quot; Even though she had the character down pat, Adams would later admit to having trouble with the &quot;Star Trek&quot; vernacular. Ishka was a radical departure for Adams: she&#x27;d never played an alien before, usually being cast as secretaries in shows such as &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot; and &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;.

==Makeup and costuming==

Before Andrea Martin accepted the role, director René Auberjonois (Odo) confided in her that working under the Ferengi prosthetics would be the hardest acting she&#x27;d ever done if she&#x27;d never worked under such makeup before. Auberjonois speculated that she took the role anyway because he&#x27;d been so frank with her. Martin&#x27;s makeup for Ishka took three hours every day. Ishka, being older, required extra development of the makeup prostheses. Makeup designer Michael Westmore explained that they &quot;made a thin skin that went over one of [their] stock Ferengi heads. They [they] made a new face for her, wrinkled, and did the backs of her hands.&quot; The script for &quot;Family Business&quot; also complicated the makeup process because it called for Ishka to be nude in several scenes; therefore, makeup needed to be developed for parts of Ferengi never before seen. One take over Ishka&#x27;s shoulder had to be reshot because the producers felt that Martin&#x27;s &quot;supple skin&quot; didn&#x27;t match the character; Westmore and crew &quot;took Kleenex, wrinkled it up and rubberized it, and covered her back and shoulders&quot;, a process Martin didn&#x27;t care for, saying, &quot;Boy, if you hadn&#x27;t warned me about this, I would be out the door.&quot;
Having never before worn prostheses, Cecily Adams found the Ishka makeup &quot;rather daunting&quot; and described the three to four hour application process before moving on to costuming. Originally the producers drew lines on Adams&#x27; hands to make them appear older, but later decided they did not look old enough and used prosthetic gloves. Once all was said and done, only the palms of Adams&#x27; hands and her upper lip were visible. After begging and pleading with the &quot;DS9&quot; staff to see the dailies, Adams realized how much she needed to over-express to have her facial expressions translate through the makeup. When she came back to &quot;DS9&quot; for season six&#x27;s &quot;The Magnificent Ferengi&quot;, Adams agreed on the condition she receive her own custom faceplate. Adams praised the other &quot;DS9&quot; actors who suffered through similar makeup ordeals saying, &quot;I think it&#x27;s astonishing that they were all in good cheer, and to be in the makeup all the time is really something.&quot; Because Ishka is flouting Ferengi law by wearing clothes, it was decided that she would overdo it, and so Adams was encumbered with &quot;baubles and bangles and beads&quot; that made so much noise on set that Adams estimated she had to dub half her lines. For &quot;Profit and Lace&quot;, where Ishka was to leave the Ferengi homeworld for the first time, Adams was dressed in a &quot;Spandex suit from [her] wrists to the tip of [her] toes&quot;. Further, because Ishka was old, the staff padded Adams&#x27; costume with , including fake breasts that Adams guessed weighed ; after watching the dailies, both Adams and Behr agreed that the breasts needed to be reduced as they were too distracting. Adams would later thank both director René Auberjonois and co-star Armin Shimerman for helping her realize that overacting was the name of the game when working under such prostheses.

==Character history==
In &quot;Family Business&quot;, Ishka is introduced as a Ferengi widow who receives a monthly stipend from her elder son, Quark (Armin Shimerman). Per Ferengi law, she is forbidden from making profit or wearing clothing, yet she has begun doing both and is found out by the Ferengi Commerce Authority (FCA; an agency essentially equivalent to the United States&#x27; Internal Revenue Service). The FCA charges Quark with his mother&#x27;s misdeeds, about which she is unrepentant, feeling that women should have the same rights and privileges as men. After much arguing with Quark, Iskha agrees to sign a confession and forfeit her earnings for her son&#x27;s sake, though she confides in Rom (Max Grodénchik) that she only gave up a third of what she had hidden away.

Season five&#x27;s &quot;Ferengi Love Songs&quot; reveals the romantic relationship between Ishka and Grand Nagus Zek, the leader of the Ferengi Alliance. When Quark is unable to extract nepotistic assistance from the Grand Nagus, he colludes with Liquidator Brunt (Jeffrey Combs) to break up the couple. Quark soon realizes however that Ishka is the real power behind the throne, giving Zek financial advice and suggestions that keep the Ferengi economy afloat. Quark confesses his part, and helps reunite Ishka and Zek.

In &quot;The Magnificent Ferengi&quot; (season six), Ishka is kidnapped by the Dominion. While in captivity at the hands of the Vorta Yelgrun (Iggy Pop), Ishka offers financial advice and tries to empathize with her captor about family. In the same season, &quot;Profit and Lace&quot; finds Ishka leaving the Ferengi homeworld of Ferenginar for the first time to travel to Deep Space Nine in the company of Grand Nagus Zek. She has convinced Zek to amend the Ferengi Bill of Opportunities to allow women to wear clothing, and the result was economic turmoil across the Ferengi Alliance. When Ishka suffers a heart attack, Quark undergoes sex reassignment surgery to take her place at Zek&#x27;s side and win back the support of an influential Ferengi commissioner. Doctor Bashir (Alexander Siddig) is able to successfully perform a heart transplantation for Ishka, and she is up and about by the end of the episode.

In the penultimate episode of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;The Dogs of War&quot;, Quark discovers that Ishka has influenced Grand Nagus Zek to the point where the Ferengi leader has promoted labor rights, enforced environmental protection, and outlawed monopolies.

===Non-canon appearances===
Ishka also appears in several officially-licensed, non-canon, &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels, e-books, and short stories:

====&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;====
* &quot;Doors into Chaos&quot; by Robert Greenberger (2001)

====&quot;Star Trek: Terok Nor&quot;====
* &quot;Dawn of the Eagles&quot; by S. D. Perry &amp; Britta Dennison (2008)

====&quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;====
* &quot;Ferenginar: Satisfaction Is Not Guaranteed&quot; by Keith DeCandido (2010)
* &quot;Lust&#x27;s Latinum Lost (and Found)&quot; by Terry J. Erdmann &amp; Paula M. Block (2014)
* &quot;Rules of Accusation&quot; by Terry J. Erdmann &amp; Paula M. Block (2016)
* &quot;I, the Constable&quot; by Terry J. Erdmann &amp; Paula M. Block (2017)

====&quot;Star Trek: Mirror Universe&quot;====
The Ishka of the Mirror Universe is wealthy, owns Terran slaves, and provided a safe harbor for the &#x27;mirror-versions&#x27; of B&#x27;Elanna Torres and Crell Moset (from the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Nothing Human&quot;). She appeared in the 2009 &quot;Star Trek: Mirror Universe&quot; story, &quot;Bitter Fruit&quot; by Susan Wright.

==Portrayal==
Crediting Andrea Martin with her broad and confident initial portrayal of Ishka, Adams commented on how easy it was to play a character so well delineated. Adams also infused Ishka with some of the stories Shimerman told of his own mother. In an interview with &quot;Star Trek: The Magazine&quot;, Adams said of Ishka: &quot;I love and adore her. How can you not? She just doesn&#x27;t care what anybody thinks; she&#x27;s so committed to what she thinks is right, and everyone else be damned. But she has a heart of gold, and she&#x27;s very strong. To be a female as strong as she was, in the kind of world she came from, was wonderful, I think.&quot; Lauding the character, Adams says that it&#x27;s Ishka&#x27;s backbone that helps her grow as an actress and as a person. Prior to November 2000, Adams appeared at several &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions with her &quot;Ferengi family&quot; and relished meeting fans who expressed how much they love the character of Ishka.

<doc id="518033" wikidata="Q1363838" url="?curid=518033" title="Harold Acton">
<text>Sir Harold Mario Mitchell Acton (5 July 1904 – 27 February 1994) was a British writer, scholar, and aesthete who was a prominent member of the Bright Young Things. He wrote fiction, biography, history and autobiography. During his stay in China, he studied the Chinese language, traditional drama, and poetry, some of which he translated.

He was born near Florence, Italy, to a prominent Anglo-Italian family. At Eton College, he was a founding member of the Eton Arts Society before going up to Oxford to read Modern Greats at Christ Church. He co-founded the avant-garde magazine &quot;The Oxford Broom&quot; and mixed with many intellectual and literary figures of the age, including Evelyn Waugh, who based the character of Anthony Blanche in &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; partly on him. Between the wars, Acton lived in Paris, London, and Florence, proving most successful as a historian, his &quot;magnum opus&quot; being a 3-volume study of the Medicis and the Bourbons.

After serving as an RAF liaison officer in the Mediterranean, he returned to Florence, restoring his childhood home, Villa La Pietra, to its earlier glory. Acton was knighted in 1974 and died in Florence, leaving La Pietra to New York University.

== Early years ==
===Background===

Acton was born to a prominent Anglo-Italian-American family of baronets, later raised to the peerage as Barons Acton of Aldenham at Villa La Pietra, his parents&#x27; house one mile outside the walls of Florence, Italy. He claimed that his great-great-grandfather was Commodore Sir John Acton, 6th Baronet (1736–1811), who married his niece, Mary Anne Acton, and who was prime minister of Naples under Ferdinand IV and grandfather of the Catholic historian Lord Acton. This relationship has been disproven; Harold Acton in fact descends from Sir John Acton&#x27;s brother, General Joseph Edward Acton (1737–1830). Both of these brothers served in Italy, and are from the Shropshire family of Actons.

His father was the successful art collector and dealer Arthur Acton (1873–1953), the illegitimate son of Eugene Arthur Roger Acton (1836–1895), and counsellor to the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. His mother, Hortense Lenore Mitchell (1871–1962), was the heiress of John J. Mitchell, a president of the Illinois Trust and Savings Bank, an appointed member of the Federal Advisory Council, and a trustee of the Art Institute of Chicago (1908–1909). Arthur Acton met Hortense in Chicago while helping to design the Italianate features of the bank&#x27;s new building in 1896, and the Mitchell fortune allowed Arthur Acton to buy the remarkable Villa La Pietra on the hills of Florence, where Harold Acton lived for much of his life. The only modern furniture in the villa was in the nurseries, and that was disposed of when the children got older (Harold&#x27;s younger brother William Acton was born in 1906).
==Career and education==
His early schooling was at Miss Penrose&#x27;s private school in Florence. In 1913, his parents sent him to Wixenford Preparatory School near Reading in southern England, where Kenneth Clark was a fellow-pupil. By 1916 submarine attacks on shipping had made the journey to England unsafe and so Harold and his brother were sent in September to Chateau de Lancy, an international school near Geneva. In the autumn of 1917, he went to a &#x27;crammers&#x27; at Ashlawn in Kent to be prepared for Eton, which he entered on 1 May 1918. Among his contemporaries at Eton were Eric Blair (the writer George Orwell), Cyril Connolly, Robert Byron, Alec Douglas-Home, Ian Fleming, Brian Howard, Oliver Messel, Anthony Powell, Steven Runciman, and Henry Yorke (the novelist Henry Green). In his final years at school, Acton became a founding member of the Eton Arts Society, and eleven of his poems appeared in &quot;The Eton Candle&quot;, edited by his friend Brian Howard.

===Oxford years===
In October 1923, Acton went up to Oxford to read Modern Greats at Christ Church. It was from the balcony of his rooms in Meadow Buildings that he declaimed passages from &quot;The Waste Land&quot; through a megaphone (an episode recounted in &quot;Brideshead Revisited,&quot; through the character Anthony Blanche). While at Oxford, he co-founded the avant-garde magazine &quot;The Oxford Broom&quot;, and published his first book of poems, &quot;Aquarium&quot; (1923). Acton was regarded as a leading figure of his day and would often receive more attention in memoirs of the period than men who were much more successful in later life; for example, the Welsh playwright Emlyn Williams described this encounter with Acton in his autobiography &quot;George&quot; (1961): Williams also described Acton&#x27;s review of &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; in the Oxford student newspaper &quot;Cherwell&quot;: &quot;a charming boy&#x27;s book, we would suggest a cheap edition to fit comfortably into the pocket of a school blazer&quot;; and summarised Acton&#x27;s modernist approach to literature: &quot;But if one finds the words, my dears, there is beauty in a black-pudding.&quot;

At Oxford Acton dominated the Railway Club, which included: Henry Yorke, Roy Harrod, Henry Thynne, 6th Marquess of Bath, David Plunket Greene, Edward Henry Charles James Fox-Strangways, 7th Earl of Ilchester, Brian Howard, Michael Parsons, 6th Earl of Rosse, John Sutro, Hugh Lygon, Harold Acton, Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne, Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross, Mark Ogilvie-Grant, John Drury-Lowe.

===Influence on Waugh===
Evelyn Waugh populated his novels with composite characters based upon individuals he knew. Acton is reputed to have inspired, at least in part, the character of &quot;Anthony Blanche&quot; in Waugh&#x27;s novel &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; (1945). In a letter to Lord Baldwin, Waugh wrote, &quot;There is an aesthetic bugger who sometimes turns up in my novels under various names – that was 2/3 Brian [Howard] and 1/3 Harold Acton. People think it was all Harold, who is a much sweeter and saner man [than Howard].&quot; Waugh also wrote, &quot;The characters in my novels often wrongly identified with Harold Acton were to a great extent drawn from Brian Howard&quot;.

===General strike and after===
In 1926 Acton acted as a &quot;special constable&quot; during the general strike, apolitical as he was, and took his degree. In October he took an apartment in Paris, at 29 Quai de Bourbon, and had his portrait painted by Pavel Tchelitcheff. Moving between Paris and London in the next few years, Acton sought to find his voice as a writer. In 1927 he began work on a novel, and a third book of poems, &quot;Five Saints and an Appendix&quot;, came out early the following year. This was followed by a prose fable, &quot;Cornelian&quot;, in March. In July Acton acted as Best Man at the wedding of Evelyn Waugh to the Honourable Evelyn Gardner. Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; bore a dedication to Acton &#x27;in Homage and Affection&#x27;, but when Acton&#x27;s own novel – disastrously entitled &quot;Humdrum&quot; – appeared in October 1928, it was slated in comparison with &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; by critics such as Cyril Connolly.

In the later 1920s, Harold frequented the London salon of Lady Cunard, where at various times he encountered Ezra Pound, Joseph Duveen and the Irish novelist George Moore. On visits to Florence he cemented his friendship with Norman Douglas, who wrote an introduction to Acton&#x27;s translation of a lubricious 18th-century memoir of Giangastone de&#x27; Medici, &quot;The Last of the Medici&quot;, privately printed in Florence in 1930 as part of the Lungarno Series. A fourth collection of poems, &quot;This Chaos&quot;, was published in Paris by Acton&#x27;s friend Nancy Cunard, though the Giangastone translation pointed in a more promising direction. History was indeed to prove far more congenial to Acton than poetry. His &quot;The Last Medici&quot; (not to be confused with the earlier book of similar title) was published by Faber in 1932, the first of a series of distinguished contributions to Italian historical studies.

One close observer, Alan Pryce-Jones, felt that life in Florence weighed upon Acton with its triviality, for, like his father, he was a hard worker and a careful scholar. The East was an escape. He took up residence in Peking, as Beijing was then known, which he found congenial. He studied Chinese language, traditional drama, and poetry. Between his arrival in 1932 and 1939 he published respected translations of &quot;Peach Blossom Fan&quot; and &quot;Modern Chinese Poetry&quot; (1936), both in collaboration with , and &quot;Famous Chinese Plays&quot; (1937) in collaboration with L.C. Arlington. His novel &quot;Peonies and Ponies&quot; (1941) is a sharp portrait of expatriate life. He translated &quot;Glue and Lacquer&quot; (1941), selected from the 17th-century writer Feng Menglong&#x27;s &quot;Tales to Rouse the World&quot;, with a preface by Arthur Waley, the leading scholar-translator and member of the Bloomsbury Group.

The Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, but Acton did not leave until 1939, when he returned to England and joined the Royal Air Force as a liaison officer. He served in India and what was then Ceylon, and then after the Liberation in Paris. When the war was over, he returned to Florence. La Pietra had been occupied by German soldiers, but he expeditiously restored it to its proper glory.

== Literary works ==

Acton&#x27;s non-historical works include four volumes of poetry, three novels, two novellas, two volumes of short stories, two volumes of autobiography and a memoir of his friend Nancy Mitford, who was his exact contemporary. His historical works include &quot;The Last Medici&quot;, a study of the later Medici Grand Dukes, and two large volumes on the House of Bourbon, rulers of the Kingdom of Naples in the 18th and earlier 19th century, which together may be said to constitute his &quot;magnum opus&quot;.

==Awards and honours==

Acton was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1965 and knighted in 1974. The British Institute in Florence, an important centre for Anglo-Florentine cultural life since 1917, renamed its collections the Harold Acton Library.

== Personal life==
Acton was Catholic; his cultural and historical commitment to the Church remained unchanged throughout his life. Acton&#x27;s name was first on a petition submitted to Rome in 1971 by British cultural élite, requesting that the traditional Latin rite of the Mass not be abrogated in England. His mother, the heiress Hortense Lenore Mitchell, a dominating personality in his life who lived on until the age of 90, did not make life easy for him but he still remained the devoted and admiring son.

Acton was a prominent member of the Bright Young Things in 1920s London.
After Acton&#x27;s death, in reply to a magazine article that speculated both about the probable suicide of Acton&#x27;s brother and about Acton&#x27;s homosexuality, author A. N. Wilson remarked, &quot;To call him homosexual would be to misunderstand the whole essence of his being&quot; and that &quot;He was more asexual than anything else&quot;. The article, by American writer David Plante, described Acton&#x27;s time at Oxford as a &quot;virile aesthete-dandy,&quot; but noted that while in China during the 1930s Acton&#x27;s predilection for boys led to a classified government document describing him as a &quot;scandalous debauchee,&quot; and prevented the possibility of his serving in the intelligence services there, when war broke out. Plante also described the young men whom Acton welcomed to La Pietra, including Alexander Zielcke, a German photographer and artist who was Acton&#x27;s lover for the last twenty-five years of his life.

When Acton died he left Villa La Pietra to New York University. In leaving his family&#x27;s property and collection to New York University, Acton expressed his desire that the estate be used as a meeting place for students, faculty, and guests who might study, teach, write and do research, and as a centre for international programs. Following his death, DNA testing confirmed the existence of a half-sister born out of wedlock, whose heirs have gone to court to challenge Acton&#x27;s $500 million bequest to New York University.

Acton was buried beside his parents and brother in the Catholic section of the Cimitero Evangelico degli Allori in the southern suburb of Florence, Galluzzo (Italy).
