<text>Henry Hobson Richardson, FAIA (September 29, 1838 – April 27, 1886) was an American architect, best known for his work in a style that became known as Richardsonian Romanesque. Along with Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright, Richardson is one of &quot;the recognized trinity of American architecture.&quot;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Richardson was born at the Priestley Plantation in St. James Parish, Louisiana, and spent part of his childhood in New Orleans, where his family lived on Julia Row in a red brick house designed by the architect Alexander T. Wood. He was the great-grandson of inventor and philosopher Joseph Priestley, who is usually credited with the discovery of oxygen.

Richardson went on to study at Harvard College and Tulane University. Initially, he was interested in civil engineering, but shifted to architecture, which led him to go to Paris in 1860 to attend the famed École des Beaux Arts in the atelier of Louis-Jules André. He was only the second U.S. citizen to attend the École&#x27;s architectural division—Richard Morris Hunt was the first—and the school was to play an increasingly important role in training Americans in the following decades.

He did not finish his training there, as family backing failed due to the U.S. Civil War.

===Career===

Richardson returned to the U.S. in 1865, settling in New York that October. He found work with a builder, Charles, whom he had met in Paris. The two worked well together but Richardson was not being challenged. He had little to do and yearned for more. With no work Richardson fell into a state of poverty looking for more work. One of his first commissions was the William Dorsheimer House he built in 1868 for William Dorsheimer (1832–1888) on Delaware Ave in Buffalo, NY, which is in the style of the Second Empire with a Mansard roof. This important commission led to many other commissions. The style that Richardson developed over time, however, was not the more classical style of the École, but a more medieval-inspired style, influenced by William Morris, John Ruskin and Viollet le Duc. Richardson developed a unique and highly personal idiom, adapting in particular the Romanesque of southern France. His early works, however, were not very remarkable. &quot;There are few hints in the mediocre work of Richardson&#x27;s early years of what was to come in his maturity, when, beginning with his competition-winning design ... for the Brattle Square Church in Boston, he adopted the Romanesque.&quot;

In 1869, he designed the Buffalo State Asylum for the Insane (now known as the Richardson Olmsted Complex) in Buffalo, the largest commission of his career and the first appearance of Richardsonian Romanesque style. A massive Medina sandstone complex, it is a National Historic Landmark and, as of 2009, was being restored.

Trinity Church in Boston, designed by Richardson and built 1872–1877, solidified his national reputation and led to major commissions for the rest of his life. Although incorporating historical elements from a variety of sources, including early Syrian Christian, Byzantine, and both French and Spanish Romanesque, it was more &quot;Richardsonian&quot; than Romanesque. Trinity was also a collaboration with the construction and engineering firm of the Norcross Brothers, with whom the architect would work on some 30 projects.

He designed the Ames Monument, which was constructed from 1880 to 1882, and is located at the highest point of the original Transcontinental Railway (the financing of which was spearheaded by Oliver Ames Jr. and his brother Oakes Ames), east of Laramie, Wyoming. The Ames brothers and family provided generous patronage for Richardson&#x27;s works, and after Oliver&#x27;s death, Richardson was commissioned to design the Ames Free Library established in 1883 by a bequeath in Ames&#x27;s will.

He was well-recognized by his peers; of ten buildings named by American architects as the best in 1885, fully half were his: besides Trinity Church, there were Albany City Hall, Sever Hall at Harvard University, the New York State Capitol in Albany (as a collaboration), and Oakes Ames Memorial Hall in North Easton, Massachusetts.

Despite the success of Trinity, Richardson built only two more churches, focusing instead on the monumental buildings he preferred, plus libraries, railroad stations, commercial buildings, and houses. Of his buildings, the two he liked best, the Allegheny County Courthouse (Pittsburgh, 1884–1888) and the Marshall Field Wholesale Store (Chicago, 1885–1887, demolished 1930), were completed posthumously by his assistants.

===Later years===
Richardson spent much of his later years in his house at 25 Cottage St. in Brookline, Massachusetts, which had a studio attached.

Richardson died in 1886 at age 47 of Bright&#x27;s disease. On his last day, he signed an informal will directing the three assistants still remaining to carry on the business, which was soon formalized as Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge. One example includes Richardson&#x27;s design for the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce Building. Richardson had won the selection process in 1885 and nearly finalized the work, but after his death his successors completed the project.

He was buried in Walnut Hills Cemetery, Brookline, Massachusetts. Despite an enormous income for an architect of his day, his &quot;reckless disregard for financial order&quot; meant that he died deeply in debt, leaving little to his widow and six children.

==Major work==
===Trinity Church===
Richardson&#x27;s most acclaimed early work is Trinity Church. The interior of the church is one of the leading examples of the arts and crafts aesthetic in the United States. It was at Trinity that Richardson first worked with Augustus Saint Gaudens, with whom he would work many times in the ensuing years. Across the square is the Boston Public Library, built later (1895) by Richardson&#x27;s former draftsman, Charles Follen McKim. Together these and the surrounding buildings comprise one of the outstanding American urban complexes, built as the centerpiece of the newly developed Back Bay.

===Richardson Olmsted Campus===
The largest building complex of HH Richardson&#x27;s career, Richardson Olmsted Complex in Buffalo, New York, United States was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986. The first building to display his characteristic style the complex of buildings was designed in concert with the famed landscape team of Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux in the late 1800s, incorporating a system of enlightened treatment for people with mental illness developed by Dr. Thomas Story Kirkbride. Over the years, as mental health treatment changed and resources were diverted, the buildings and grounds began a slow deterioration. In 2006, the Richardson Center Corporation was formed with a mandate to save the buildings and bring the Campus back to life through a state appropriation.

Today, the Richardson Olmsted Campus is being transformed into a cultural amenity for the city. Arriving in 2018, the Richardson Olmsted Campus will also have the Lipsey Architecture Center of Buffalo. The remaining buildings have been stabilized pending future opportunities.

===Building types===
Richardson pointedly claimed ability to create any type of structure a client wanted, insisting he could design anything &quot;from a cathedral to a chicken coop.&quot; &quot;The things I want most to design are a grain elevator and the interior of a great river-steamboat.&quot; However, architectural historian James F. O&#x27;Gorman sees Richardson&#x27;s achievement particularly in four building types: public libraries, commuter train station buildings, commercial buildings, and single-family houses.

===Public libraries===
A series of small public libraries donated by patrons for the improvement of New England towns makes a small coherent corpus that defines Richardson&#x27;s style: Winn Memorial Library (Woburn), Ames Free Library (Easton), the Converse Memorial Library (Malden), and the Thomas Crane Public Library (Quincy), (1880–1882) &quot;generally regarded by architectural historians as the masterpiece of Richardson&#x27;s libraries&quot;, the Hubbard Memorial Library (Ludlow, Massachusetts), and Billings Memorial Library on the campus of the University of Vermont. These buildings seem resolutely anti-modern, with the atmosphere of an Episcopalian vicarage, dimly lit for solemnity rather than reading on site. They are preserves of culture that did not especially embrace the contemporary flood of newcomers to New England. Yet they offer clearly defined spaces, easy and natural circulation, and they are visually memorable. Richardson&#x27;s libraries found many imitators in the &quot;Richardsonian Romanesque&quot; movement.

The Thomas Crane Public Library is regarded as the best of Richardson&#x27;s libraries. In his earlier libraries, Richardson&#x27;s approach was to conceive the parts and then assemble them, while in the later ones such as Crane he thought in terms of the whole. Richardson also engaged in a process of simplification and elimination with each successive library, until in Crane &quot;Richardson&#x27;s concentration on the relation of solid to void, of wall to window, becomes the basis for a harmonious abstraction with scarcely a reference to any past style.&quot;

===Railroad buildings===
Richardson also designed nine railroad station buildings for the Boston &amp; Albany Railroad as well as three stations for other lines. More subtle than his churches, municipal buildings and libraries, they were an original response to this relatively new building type. Beginning with his first at Auburndale (1881, demolished 1960s), Richardson drew inspiration for these station buildings from Japanese architecture that he learned about from Edward S. Morse, a Harvard zoologist who began traveling to Japan in 1877, originally for biological specimens. Falling in love with Japan, upon his return that same year Morse began giving illustrated &quot;magic lantern&quot; public lectures on Japanese ceramics, temples, vernacular architecture, and culture. Richardson incorporated Japanese concepts &quot;in both sihouette and spatial concept&quot;, including the &quot;karahafu&quot; (&quot;excellent gable&quot;, but generally poorly translated as &quot;Chinese gable&quot; despite its Japanese origin), the eyelid dormer, and the wide hip roof with extended eaves, all shown by Morse.

Among the few stations still extant, these influences are perhaps best illustrated in his Old Colony station (Easton, Massachusetts, 1881–1884). Here he uses the Syrian arch that became a hallmark of Richardson designs for both the porte-cochère and the windows of the main structure. Reminiscent of a courtyard and temple that Morse illustrated from Nikkō in Tochigi prefecture, Japan, the hip roof on wide, bracketed eaves nearly hides the rough stonework below in shadow. Richardson even included a carved dragon at each end of the beam spanning the arches of windows. The walls &quot;become horizontal planes hovering above one another with bands of windows in between.&quot;

Richardson was an early although not the first U.S. architect to look to Japan, but his train stations &quot;form the earliest sustained application of Japanese inspiration in American architecture, an undeniable precursor to Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Prairie house designs&quot;. As with his libraries, Richardson evolved and simplified as the series continued, and his famous Chestnut Hill station (Newton, Massachusetts, 1883–1884, demolished circa 1960) featured clean lines with less Japanese influence.

After his death, more than 20 other stations were designed in Richardson&#x27;s style for the Boston and Albany line by the firm of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, all draftsmen of Richardson at the time of his death. Many Boston and Albany stations were landscaped by Richardson&#x27;s frequent collaborator, Frederick Law Olmsted. Additionally, a railroad station in Orchard Park, New York (near Buffalo) was built in 1911 as a replica of Richardson&#x27;s Auburndale station in Auburndale, Massachusetts. The original Auburndale station was torn down in the 1960s during construction of the Massachusetts Turnpike. The original Richardson stations on the Boston and Albany Highland branch have either been demolished or converted to new uses (such as restaurants). Two of the stations designed by Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge (both in Newton, Massachusetts) are still used by Boston&#x27;s MBTA (green line) public transit service: and Newton Highlands station and Newton Centre station.

===Commercial buildings===
The noted Marshall Field Wholesale Store (Chicago, 1885–1887, demolished 1930) is Richardson&#x27;s &quot;culminating statement of urban commercial form&quot;, and its remarkable design influenced Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright, and many other architects. According to Jeffrey Karl Ochsner, who has compiled all of Richardson&#x27;s architectural works, despite its demolition in 1930, the Marshall Field Wholesale Store &quot;is probably the most famous of Richardson&#x27;s buildings, one that Richardson himself saw as among his most significant.&quot; Architectural critic Henry-Russell Hitchcock states that in the Field Store, Richardson &quot;was, perhaps, never more creative architecturally.&quot; Drawing from his own earlier work and both Romanesque and Renaissance precedents, Richardson designed this &quot;massive but integrated&quot; seven-story stone warehouse. Minimizing ornamentation in an era that employed much of it, he stressed what he termed &quot;the beauty of material and symmetry rather than mere superficial ornamentation&quot; with &quot;the effects depending on the relations of &#x27;voids and solids&#x27;... on the proportion of the parts.&quot; Not requiring the new steel frame technology because of its comparatively low height, Richardson used multi-storied windows topped by arches to tie the stories together, and the regular patterns of the windows to tie the entire building into &quot;a simple and unified solid occupying an entire block.&quot;

===Single-family houses===
Richardson designed many important single-family residences, but his famous John J. Glessner House (Chicago, 1885–87) is his best and most influential urban house. The Mary Fisk Stoughton House (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1882–1883), the Henry Potter House (St. Louis, 1886–1887, demolished 1958), and the Robert Treat Paine Estate (aka Stonehurst) (Waltham, Massachusetts, 1886) play that role for suburban and country settings. The Glessner House in particular influenced Frank Lloyd Wright as he began developing what would become his Prairie School houses. With his house for Reverend Percy Browne (Marion, Massachusetts, 1881–82) Richardson revived &quot;the old colonial form (of the gambrel roof) to shape the facade of an artistically ambitious house. Perhaps he used the gambrel to signify the humility appropriate to the profession of his client, but in doing so he sanctioned its use for wealthier patrons and by other architects. Within three years the crumpled gambrel profile was showing up everywhere&quot; and became one of the notable features of Shingle Style architecture.

==Richardsonian Romanesque==

Richardson is one of few architects to be immortalized by having a style named after him. &quot;Richardsonian Romanesque&quot;, unlike Victorian revival styles like Neo-Gothic, was a highly personal synthesis of the Beaux-Arts predilection for clear and legible plans, with the heavy massing that was favored by the pro-medievalists. It featured picturesque roofline profiles, rustication and polychromy, semi-circular arches supported on clusters of squat columns, and round arches over clusters of windows on massive walls.

Following his death, the Richardsonian style was perpetuated by a variety of proteges and other architects, many for civic buildings like city halls, county buildings, court houses, train stations and libraries, as well as churches and residences. These include:
* the successor firm of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, who completed some two dozen unfinished projects and then continued to produce work in the same style, and continued to employ his collaborators the Norcross Brothers for construction and engineering expertise, Frederick Law Olmsted for landscape architecture, and the English sculptor John Evans for stonecarving
* Stanford White and Charles Follen McKim, who worked in Richardson&#x27;s office as young men, went on to form McKim, Mead and White and moved into the radically different Beaux-Arts architecture style
* Richardson&#x27;s great admirer Louis Sullivan adapted Richardson&#x27;s characteristic lessons of texture, massing, and the expressive language of stone walling (see Richardson&#x27;s noted Chicago building Marshall Field&#x27;s Wholesale Store), particularly at Chicago&#x27;s Auditorium Building, and these influences are detectable in the work of Sullivan&#x27;s own student Frank Lloyd Wright.
* Richardson found sympathetic reception among young Scandinavian architects of the following generation, notably Eliel Saarinen.

* The Patrick F. Taylor Library, formerly known as the Howard Memorial Library, was built soon after Richardson&#x27;s death. It is sometimes called &quot;the only Richardson building located in the South&quot;. Residents of New Orleans had wanted an example of Richardson&#x27;s work, a native son of New Orleans. The office of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge used a Richardson design which had been submitted and rejected some years earlier for a library in Saginaw, Michigan. This leads some, particularly those in New Orleans, to argue that the building can be said to be by Richardson; the counter argument is that the design was not originally intended for this location and the building was constructed after Richardson&#x27;s death with no input from the architect beyond the initial design. The library building is currently part of the Ogden Museum of Southern Art.
* The Amelia S. Givin Library in Mount Holly Springs, PA was designed by James T. Steen, a well known Pittsburgh architect who worked extensively in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. The Givin Library was built in 1889 in the Richardsonian style. Its interior was finished in an Orientalism theme which used the 1885 patented Moorish Fretwork screens of Moses Younglove Ransom. The Givin Library is still in use as a public library.

==Replicas==
Although many structures exist in the Romanesque style and some borrow so heavily that they are often mistaken for Richardson designs, several buildings have been built specifically to mimic a single Richardson structure.
* Wellesley Farms Railroad Station – This structure was built by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge (draftsmen of Richardson) soon after Richardson&#x27;s death. Although this firm built many stations in Richardson&#x27;s style, they were specifically penalized for this one because it was so similar to Richardson&#x27;s Eliot station in Newton, Massachusetts. Eliot station was torn down in the 1950s.
* A railroad station in Orchard Park, New York (near Buffalo), was built in 1911 as a replica of Richardson&#x27;s Auburndale station in Auburndale, Massachusetts. The original Auburndale station, Richardson&#x27;s first for the Boston &amp; Albany Railroad and which was described by Henry Russell Hitchcock as &quot;the best he ever built&quot;, was torn down in the 1960s during construction of the Massachusetts Turnpike.
* The Old Orange County Courthouse in Santa Ana, California, was completed in 1906 and is heavily influenced by Richardson&#x27;s designs, bearing a strong resemblance to Richardson&#x27;s Sever Hall at Harvard.
* Castle Hill Light is a lighthouse in Newport, Rhode Island, which is often attributed to Richardson. Richardson drew a sketch for the lighthouse at that location which may have been the basis for the design, though the actual structure does not include the residence featured in Richardson&#x27;s sketch.

<text>The Menapii were a Belgic tribe dwelling near the North Sea, around present-day Cassel, during the Iron Age and the Roman period.

== History ==
The Menapii were persistent opponents of Julius Caesar&#x27;s conquest of Gaul, resisting until 54 BC. They were part of the Belgic confederacy defeated by Caesar in 57 BC, contributing 9,000 men. The following year they sided with the Veneti against Caesar. Caesar was again victorious, but the Menapii and the Morini refused to make peace and continued to fight against him. They withdrew into the forests and swamps and conducted a hit-and-run campaign. Caesar responded by cutting down the forests, seizing their cattle and burning their settlements, but this was interrupted by heavy rain and the onset of winter, and the Menapii and Morini withdrew further into the forests. In 55 BC the Menapii tried to resist a Germanic incursion across the Rhine, but were defeated. Later that year, while Caesar made his first expedition to Britain, he sent two of his legates and the majority of his army to the territories of the Menapii and Morini to keep them under control. Once again, they retired to the woods, and the Romans burned their crops and settlements. The Menapii joined the revolt led by Ambiorix in 54 BC. Caesar says that they, alone of all the tribes of Gaul, had never sent ambassadors to him to discuss terms of peace, and had ties of hospitality with Ambiorix. For that reason he decided to lead five legions against them. A renewed campaign of devastation finally forced them to submit, and Caesar placed his ally Commius of the Atrebates in control of them.

A cohort of Menapian auxiliaries is attested by inscriptions dating to the 2nd century in Britain. Carausius, the 3rd century commander of the Roman fleet who declared himself emperor of Britain and northern Gaul, was a Menapian, born in Batavia. A legion called the Menapii Seniores is mentioned in the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, a 5th-century register of Roman government positions and military commands.

== Name ==
=== Attestations ===
They are mentioned as &quot;Menapii&quot; by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC) and Orosius (early 5th c. AD), &quot;Menápioi&quot; (Μενάπιοι; Μονάπιοι, Μενάσπιοι) by Strabo (early 1st c. AD) and Ptolemy (2nd c. AD), as &quot;Menapi&quot; by Pliny (1st c. AD) and the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; (5th c. AD), and under the accusative forms &quot;Menapios&quot; by Tacitus (early 2nd c. AD) and &quot;Menapíous&quot; (Μεναπίους) by Cassius Dio (3rd c. AD).

=== Etymology ===
The Gaulish ethnonym &quot;Menapii&quot; has been phonetically compared with &quot;Manapii&quot;, the name of a tribe from southeastern Ireland mentioned by Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD. These tribal names may ultimately derive from a Proto-Celtic form reconstructed as *&quot;Menakwī&quot; or *&quot;Manakwī&quot;, whose meaning remains uncertain, perhaps the &#x27;mountain people&#x27; or the &#x27;high-living people&#x27; (from the root *&quot;mon&quot;- &#x27;mountain&#x27;; cf. MWelsh &quot;mynydd&quot;, OBret. &quot;monid&quot;, OCo. &quot;menit&quot;), or from the root *&quot;men&quot;- (&#x27;think, remember&#x27;; cf. OIr. &quot;muinithir&quot; &#x27;think&#x27;, Welsh &quot;mynnu&quot; &#x27;wish&#x27;).

The city of Cassel, attested on Peutinger&#x27;s Tabula as &quot;Castellum Menapiorum&quot; (&quot;Cassello&quot; in 840–75, &quot;Cassel&quot; in 1110), is indirectly named after the tribe.

==Geography==

=== Territory ===
According to descriptions in such authors as Strabo, Caesar, Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy their territory had stretched northwards to the mouth of the Rhine in the north, but more lastingly it stretched along the west of the Scheldt river. In later geographical terms this territory corresponds roughly to the modern Belgian coast, the Belgian provinces of East and West Flanders. It also extended into neighbouring France and the river deltas of the Southern Netherlands.

To the north and east of the Menapii lay the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta. In the time of Caesar, the Menapii had settlements throughout this region and as far as the Rhine in present-day Germany, or at least its branch, the Waal. During Roman times these islands were under the frontier province of Germania Inferior, and inhabited partly by various groups of people who had moved there under Roman rule. Pliny the elder lists the people in these &quot;Gallic Islands&quot; as Batavi and Canninefates on the largest island, Frisii and the Chauci whose main lands were to the north of the deltas, and the Frisiavones, Sturii, and Marsacii. Of these last three, the Marsaci appear to be mentioned in another place by Pliny as having a presence on the coast south of the delta, neighbouring the Menapii, within Gaul itself. The Frisiavones are also mentioned within the listing for Belgian Gaul, but probably therefore lived in the part of the delta south of the Batavi, northeast of the Menapii. In one inscription, from Bulla Regia, the Tungri, Batavians and Frisiavones are grouped together, apparently confirming that the Frisiavones lived inland. It is suggested that the &quot;Marsaci&quot; and the &quot;Sturii&quot; could be &quot;pagi&quot; belonging to the &quot;civitas&quot; of either the Frisiavones or the Menapii. South of the delta, east of the river Scheldt from the Menapii, and therefore apparently south of the Frisiavones, Pliny mentions the Toxandri, in a position apparently on the northern edge of Gaul. It is known that the Toxandri were associated with the &quot;civitates&quot; of both the Nervii and the Tungri, so they presumably had a presence in both.

While in Pliny the Menapii do not stretch beyond the Scheldt, in Strabo&#x27;s 1st-century &quot;Geographica&quot;, they are situated further away than the Nervii and on both sides of the Rhine near its outlets to the sea, apparently not far from the Germanic Sigambri. Apparently following Caesar he said that they &quot;dwell amongst marshes and forests, not lofty, but consisting of dense and thorny wood&quot;. They are also referred to in Ptolemy&#x27;s 2nd century &quot;Geographia&quot;, situated &quot;above&quot; the Nervii, and near the Meuse river.

While these authors make it clear that the Menapii still lay north of the Nervii in Roman times, it is not clear if they still bordered directly upon the former territory of the Eburones, as they had been in Caesar&#x27;s time, and which in imperial times was within the Civitas Tungrorum, or &quot;civitas&quot; of the Tungri. In any case as mentioned above they bordered in Roman times upon the Toxandrians, who apparently lived in the north of the lands of the Nervii and Tungri.

South of the Menapii were the Atrebates in Artois, and south-west along the coast were the Morini. The boundary with the Morini in classical times appears to have been the river Aa.

In the later Roman Empire, &quot;The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites&quot; reports that &quot;Cassel was superseded as capital of the Menapii by Tournai after Gaul was reorganized under Diocletian and Constantine the Great. The &quot;civitas Menapiorum&quot; became the &quot;civitas Turnencensium&quot;.&quot; By medieval times, when these Roman districts evolved into medieval Roman Catholic dioceses, Cassel had in fact become part of the diocese of Thérouanne, which had been the &quot;civitas&quot; of the Morini.

=== Settlements ===
Their &quot;civitas&quot;, or administrative capital, under the Roman Empire was Cassel in northern France, and later this was moved nearer to a river in Tournai, in present-day Belgium, on the Scheldt. Both of these are near Thérouanne, which was the &quot;civitas&quot; of the neighbouring Morini tribe, and indeed in the Middle Ages Cassel became part of the Catholic Diocese of Thérouanne. Cassel was therefore in the southern extreme of the Menapii lands. A pattern of placing Roman tribal capitals in the south is also found in the neighbouring Belgian tribal states, of the Nervii and Tungri. The positions of such Roman tribal capitals frequently didn&#x27;t correspond to the centre of a tribe&#x27;s territory in pre-Roman political geography. Similarly, in those neighbouring regions, the centre of Roman civilization was typically moved further south, and on to a major river, in late Roman times, after the area was threatened by Frankish tribes from outside the empire.

== Economy ==
The economic activity of the Menapii was primally extraction of wool from sheep, and the fabrication of primitive cloths, and these were perfected while the Roman Reign in the Region. These cloths were one of the most rare things in terms of goods, because of the geographical location where they were made. Besides, these cloths were exported to Italy and other regions through the Rhine.

<doc id="511640" wikidata="Q238612" url="?curid=511640" title="5.1 surround sound">
<text>5.1 surround sound (&quot;five-point one&quot;) is the common name for surround sound audio systems. 5.1 is the most commonly used layout in home theatres. It uses five full-bandwidth channels and one low-frequency effects channel (the &quot;point one&quot;). Dolby Digital, Dolby Pro Logic II, DTS, SDDS, and THX are all common 5.1 systems. 5.1 is also the standard surround sound audio component of digital broadcast and music.

All 5.1 systems use the same speaker channels and configuration, having a Front Left (FL) and Front Right (FR), a Center Channel (CNT), two surround channels (Surround Left - SL and Surround Right - SR) and the low-frequency effects (LFE) channel designed for a subwoofer.

==History==
A prototype for five-channel surround sound, then dubbed &quot;quintaphonic sound&quot;, was used in the 1975 film &quot;Tommy&quot;.

5.1 dates back to 1976, when Dolby Labs modified the track usage of the six analogue magnetic soundtracks on Todd-AO 70 mm film prints. The Dolby application of optical matrix encoding in 1976 (released on the film &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;) did not use split surrounds, and thus was not 5.1. Dolby first used split surrounds with 70 mm film, notably in 1979 with &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. Instead of the five screen channels and one surround channel of the Todd-AO format, Dolby Stereo 70 mm Six Track provided three screen channels, two high-passed surround channels and a low-frequency surround channel monophonically blended with the two surround channels.

A system of digital 5.1 surround sound was also used in 1987 at the Parisian cabaret the Moulin Rouge, created by French engineer Dominique Bertrand. To achieve such a system in 1985, a dedicated mixing console had to be designed in cooperation with Solid State Logic, based on their 5000 series, and dedicated speakers in cooperation with APG. The console included ABCDEF channels: respectively, A left, B right, C centre, D left rear, E right rear, F bass. The same engineer had already developed a similar 3.1 system in 1973, for use at the official International Summit of Francophone States in Dakar.

Digital sound and the 5.1 format were introduced in 1990, by Kodak and Optical Radiation Corporation, with releases of &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; and &quot;The Doors&quot; using the CDS (Cinema Digital Sound) format.

When digital sound was applied to 35 mm release prints, with &quot;Batman Returns&quot; in 1992, the 5.1 layout was adopted. The ability to provide 5.1 sound had been one of the key reasons for using 70 mm for prestige screenings. The provision of 5.1 digital sound on 35 mm significantly reduced the use of the very expensive 70 mm format.

5.1 digital surround, in the forms of Dolby Digital AC-3 and DTS, started appearing on several mid-1990s LaserDisc releases, among the earliest being &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (the latter having both AC3 and DTS versions). Many DVD releases have Dolby Digital tracks up to 5.1 channels, due to the implementation of Dolby Digital in the development of the DVD format. In addition, some DVDs have DTS tracks, with most being 5.1 channel mixes (a few releases, however, have 6.1 &quot;matrixed&quot; or even discrete 6.1 tracks). Blu-ray and digital cinema both have eight-channel capability which can be used to provide either 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound. 7.1 is an extension of 5.1 that uses four surround zones: two at the sides and two at the back.

==Application==

===Channel order===
The order of channels in a 5.1 file is different across file formats. The order in WAV files is (not complete) Front Left, Front Right, Center, Low-frequency effects, Surround Left, Surround Right.

=== Music ===
In music, the main goal of 5.1 surround sound is a proper localization and equability of all acoustic sources for a center-positioned audience. Therefore, ideally five matched speakers should be used.

=== Speaker placement ===
For playback the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recommends the following configuration (ITU-R BS 775):
* five speakers of the same size for front, center and surround
* identical distance from the listeners for all five speakers
* angle adjustment regarding viewing direction of audience: center 0°, front ±22.5° for movies ±30° for music, surround ±110°

<text>A 2D geometric model is a geometric model of an object as a two-dimensional figure, usually on the Euclidean or Cartesian plane.

Even though all material objects are three-dimensional, a 2D geometric model is often adequate for certain flat objects, such as paper cut-outs and machine parts made of sheet metal. Other examples include circles used as a model of thunderstorms, which can be considered flat when viewed from above.

2D geometric models are also convenient for describing certain types of artificial images, such as technical diagrams, logos, the glyphs of a font, etc. They are an essential tool of 2D computer graphics and often used as components of 3D geometric models, e.g. to describe the decals to be applied to a car model. Modern architecture practice &quot;digital rendering&quot; which is a technique used to form a perception of a 2-D geometric model as of a 3-D geometric model designed through descriptive geometry and computerized equipment.

<doc id="511653" wikidata="Q260208" url="?curid=511653" title="Dolls (2002 film)">
<text>is a 2002 Japanese film written, edited and directed by Japanese director Takeshi Kitano. A highly stylized art film, &quot;Dolls&quot; is part of Kitano&#x27;s non-crime film oeuvre, like 1991&#x27;s &quot;A Scene at the Sea&quot;, and unlike most of his other films, he does not act in it. The film has been praised for its cinematography (Katsumi Yanagishima) and features costumes by Yohji Yamamoto.

==Plot==
The film features three primary sets of characters, each within their own distinct story:

* A young man (&quot;Matsumoto&quot;, played by Hidetoshi Nishijima) who rejects his engagement to his fiancée (&quot;Sawako&quot;, played by Miho Kanno) to marry the daughter of his company&#x27;s president. When his former fiancée attempts suicide and ends up in a semi-catatonic state, he takes her out of the hospital and they run away.
* Another young man (&quot;Nukui&quot;, played by Tsutomu Takeshige) is obsessed with the pop-star &quot;Haruna&quot; (played by Kyoko Fukada); he blinds himself when she is involved in a disfiguring car accident.
* An aged yakuza (&quot;Hiro&quot;, played by Tatsuya Mihashi), who tries to meet a girlfriend from his youth (played by Chieko Matsubara).

These stories do have some incidental visual cross-over with each other in the film, but are mostly separate. The first story is the one on which the film centers. The film leads into it by opening with a performance of Bunraku theatre, and closes with a shot of dolls from the same. The performance is that of &quot;The Courier for Hell&quot; by Chikamatsu Monzaemon, and it alludes to themes that reappear later in the film. Because the rest of the film itself (as Kitano himself has said) can be treated as Bunraku in film form, the film is quite symbolic. In some cases, it is not clear whether a particular scene is meant to be taken literally. The film is also not in strict chronological order, but there is a strong visual emphasis on the changing of the seasons and the bonds of love over the progression of time (Matsumoto and Sawako spend most of the film physically connected by a red rope).

==Cast==
* Miho Kanno as Sawako
* Hidetoshi Nishijima as Matsumoto
* Tatsuya Mihashi as Hiro, the boss
** Kanji Tsuda as young Hiro
* Chieko Matsubara as Ryoko, the woman in the park
** Yūko Daike as young Ryoko
* Kyoko Fukada as Haruna Yamaguchi, the pop star
* Tsutomu Takeshige as Nukui, the fan
* Kayoko Kishimoto as Haruna&#x27;s aunt
* Ren Osugi as Haruna&#x27;s manager

==Themes==
The film and each of its vignettes revolve closely around the theme of death. It was Kitano&#x27;s intent to show death as neither good nor bad but a relative event. In an interview, Kitano stated, &quot;The reason why modern Japanese and Westerners loathe the notion of death so much is beyond me. There really is no reason to loathe death,&quot; adding, &quot;How you perceive this film can considerably differ depending on the position where you stand.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

&quot;All compositions by Joe Hisaishi.&quot;

# &quot;Sakura&quot; − 4:40
# &quot;Pure White&quot; − 2:48
# &quot;Mad&quot; − 4:55
# &quot;Feel&quot; − 4:58
# &quot;Dolls&quot; − 4:09

==Reception==
The film received generally positive reviews. &quot;Dolls&quot; has an approval rating of 73% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 41 reviews, and an average rating of 6.6/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;&quot;Dolls&quot; doesn&#x27;t offer easy answers, but for audiences attuned to its beguiling wavelength, writer-director Takeshi Kitano&#x27;s work offers rich, distinctive rewards&quot;. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;.

==Adaptations==
A stage adaptation of the film was directed by Carrie Cracknell in 2009 for Hush Productions and the National Theatre of Scotland.

<doc id="511665" wikidata="Q1967656" url="?curid=511665" title="National Recovery Administration">
<text>The National Recovery Administration (NRA) was a prime agency established by U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) in 1933. The goal of the administration was to eliminate &quot;cut throat competition&quot; by bringing industry, labor, and government together to create codes of &quot;fair practices&quot; and set prices. The NRA was created by the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) and allowed industries to get together and write &quot;codes of fair competition&quot;. The codes intended both to help workers set minimum wages and maximum weekly hours, as well as minimum prices at which products could be sold. The NRA also had a two-year renewal charter and was set to expire in June 1935 if not renewed.

The NRA, symbolized by the Blue Eagle, was popular with workers. Businesses that supported the NRA put the symbol in their shop windows and on their packages, though they did not always go along with the regulations entailed. Though membership of the NRA was voluntary, businesses that did not display the eagle were very often boycotted, making it seem mandatory for survival to many.

In 1935, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously declared that the NRA law was unconstitutional, ruling that it infringed the separation of powers under the United States Constitution. The NRA quickly stopped operations, but many of its labor provisions reappeared in the National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act), passed later the same year. The long-term result was a surge in the growth and power of unions, which became a core of the New Deal Coalition that dominated national politics for the next three decades.

==Background==
As part of the &quot;First New Deal&quot;, the NRA was based on the premise that the Great Depression was caused by market instability and that government intervention was necessary to balance the interests of farmers, business and labor. The NIRA, which created the NRA, declared that codes of fair competition should be developed through public hearings, and gave the Administration the power to develop voluntary agreements with industries regarding work hours, pay rates, and price fixing. The NRA was put into operation by an executive order, signed the same day as the passage of the NIRA.

New Dealers who were part of the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt saw the close analogy with the earlier crisis handling the economics of World War I. They brought ideas and experience from the government controls and spending of 1917–18.

In his June 13, 1933 &quot;Statement on the National Industrial Recovery Act&quot;, President Roosevelt described the spirit of the NRA: &quot;On this idea, the first part of the NIRA proposes to our industry a great spontaneous cooperation to put millions of men back in their regular jobs this summer.&quot; He further stated, &quot;But if all employers in each trade now band themselves faithfully in these modern guilds—without exception—and agree to act together and at once, none will be hurt and millions of workers, so long deprived of the right to earn their bread in the sweat of their labor, can raise their heads again. The challenge of this law is whether we can sink selfish interest and present a solid front against a common peril.&quot;

==Inception==
The first director of the NRA was Hugh S. Johnson, a retired United States Army general who had been in charge of supervising the wartime economy in 1917–1918. He was named &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Man of the Year&quot; in 1933. Johnson saw the NRA as a national crusade designed to restore employment and regenerate industry.

Johnson called on every business establishment in the nation to accept a stopgap &quot;blanket code&quot;: a minimum wage of between 20 and 45 cents per hour, a maximum workweek of 35 to 45 hours, and the abolition of child labor. Johnson and Roosevelt contended that the &quot;blanket code&quot; would raise consumer purchasing power and increase employment.

Historian Clarence B. Carson noted:

At this moment in time from the early days of the New Deal, it is difficult to recapture, even in imagination, the heady enthusiasm among a goodly number of intellectuals for a government planned economy. So far as can now be told, they believed that a bright new day was dawning, that national planning would result in an organically integrated economy in which everyone would joyfully work for the common good, and that American society would be freed at last from those antagonisms arising, as General Hugh Johnson put it, from &quot;the murderous doctrine of savage and wolfish individualism, looking to dog-eat-dog and devil take the hindmost.


===Coal===
The negotiations of a code for the bituminous coal industry came against the background of a rapidly swelling union, the United Mine Workers headed by John L. Lewis and an unstable truce in the Pennsylvania coal fields. The NRA tried to get the principals to compromise with a national code for a decentralized industry in which many companies were anti-union, sought to keep wage differentials, and tried to escape the collective bargaining provisions of section 7A. Agreement among the parties was finally reached only after the NRA threatened that it would impose a code. The code did not establish price stabilization, nor did it resolve questions of industrial self-government versus governmental supervision or of centralization versus local autonomy, but it made dramatic changes in abolishing child labor, eliminating the compulsory scrip wages and company store, and establishing fair trade practices. It paved the way for an important wage settlement.

===Price controls===
In early 1935 the new chairman, Samuel Clay Williams, announced that the NRA would stop setting prices, but businessmen complained. Chairman Williams told them plainly that, unless they could prove it would damage business, NRA was going to put an end to price control. Williams said, &quot;Greater productivity and employment would result if greater price flexibility were attained.&quot; Of the 2,000 businessmen on hand probably 90% opposed Mr. Williams&#x27; aim, reported &quot;Time&quot; magazine: &quot;To them a guaranteed price for their products looks like a royal road to profits. A fixed price above cost has proved a lifesaver to more than one inefficient producer.&quot; However, it was also argued NRA&#x27;s price control method promoted monopolies.

The business position was summarized by George A. Sloan, head of the Cotton Textile Code Authority:

Maximum hours and minimum wage provisions, useful and necessary as they are in themselves, do not prevent price demoralization. While putting the units of an industry on a fair competitive level insofar as labor costs are concerned, they do not prevent destructive price cutting in the sale of commodities produced, any more than a fixed price of material or other element of cost would prevent it. Destructive competition at the expense of employees is lessened, but it is left in full swing against the employer himself and the economic soundness of his enterprise...But if the partnership of industry with Government which was invoked by the President were terminated (as we believe it will not be), then the spirit of cooperation, which is one of the best fruits of the NRA equipment, could not survive.

==The Blue Eagle==
The Blue Eagle was a symbol used in the United States by companies to show compliance with and support of the National Industrial Recovery Act. To mobilize political support for the NRA, Johnson launched the &quot;NRA Blue Eagle&quot; publicity campaign to boost his bargaining strength to negotiate the codes with business and labor. Businesses were entitled to display the logo only if they abided by the labor standards mandated by the NIRA, including increased hourly wages and maximum work hours. President Roosevelt&#x27;s goal was for consumers to only shop at stores that displayed the Blue Eagle, and to avoid stores that did not. In doing this, Roosevelt hoped that those stores which did not comply with the policies of the NRA would change their stance, or they would risk experiencing &quot;economic death&quot; as a result.

Many sources credit advertising art director Charles T. Coiner with the design. When the NRA was looking for someone to design its symbol, a governmental contract with Philadelphia advertising agency N.W. Ayer led them to Coiner, who had gotten a job with Ayer in 1924, nine years before the creation of the NRA. According to a few sources, however, it was sketched by Johnson, based on an idea used by the War Industries Board during World War I. The eagle holds a gear, symbolizing industry, in its right talon, and bolts of lightning in its left talon, symbolizing power. The NRA&#x27;s slogan, &quot;We Do Our Part&quot;, often appeared below the eagle, encouraging consumers to feel part of a collective effort.

All companies that accepted President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Re-employment Agreement or a special Code of Fair Competition were permitted to display a poster showing the Blue Eagle together with the announcement, &quot;NRA Member. We Do Our Part.&quot; In addition, manufacturers began affixing the logo to product packaging and other advertising, with the Blue Eagle appearing on clothing labels, food packages, cigar labels, fruit crates, sheet music, shaving razors, and typewriter ribbons. When the Blue Eagle was first introduced, it arrived with a flurry of hope for businesses and individuals struggling as a result of the Great Depression. Shortly after the rules of the NRA were established, more than 10,000 businesses applied for the right to display the Blue Eagle in their store windows, by pledging their support to the program. Johnson decided to put together a Blue Eagle drive to gain support for the movement; while it worked initially, support dwindled as time went on. What started as mass support of the NRA and the Blue Eagle symbol that accompanied it turned into resentment and disapproval, especially from the businesses that were boycotted because they refused to display the symbol in their front windows.
In addition to businesses displaying posters in storefront windows, in advertising, and in packaging and labels, American consumers and businesses used the Blue Eagle in a variety of other ways. Citizen consumers stitched the logo onto doilies, tapestries, and quilts to show their allegiance to the program. Grassroots quilt makers designed, constructed, and displayed quilts bearing the symbol, not following one pattern source, but creating their own. Some of these quilt makers sent their Blue Eagle quilts as gifts to the Roosevelts. Like any other art, there is more meaning behind these quilts than being simply quilts; the NRA and Blue Eagle were a big enough impact for artists to incorporate it into their work. Other items that used the Blue Eagle symbol include buttons, picture frames, candy boxes and tape packaging. The most famous use of the Blue Eagle is perhaps as an NFL team name, when the franchise from Philadelphia named their team the Eagles. Bert Bell and Lud Wray purchased the team in 1933 and changed the name of the team in honor of the NRA.

==Critics==
Most businesses adopted the NRA without complaint, but Henry Ford was reluctant to join.

The National Recovery Review Board, headed by noted criminal lawyer Clarence Darrow, a prominent liberal, was set up by President Roosevelt in March 1934 and abolished by him that same June. The board issued three reports highly critical of the NRA from the perspective of small business, charging the NRA with fostering cartels. The Darrow board, influenced by Justice Louis D. Brandeis, wanted instead to promote competitive capitalism.

Representing big business, the American Liberty League, 1934–40, was run by leading industrialists who opposed the liberalism of the New Deal. Regarding the controversial NRA, the League was ambivalent. Jouett Shouse, the League president, commented that &quot;the NRA has indulged in unwarranted excesses of attempted regulation&quot;; on the other, he added that &quot;in many regards [the NRA] has served a useful purpose.&quot; Shouse said that he had &quot;deep sympathy&quot; with the goals of the NRA, explaining, &quot;While I feel very strongly that the prohibition of child labor, the maintenance of a minimum wage and the limitation of the hours of work belong under our form of government in the realm of the affairs of the different states, yet I am entirely willing to agree that in the case of an overwhelming national emergency the Federal Government for a limited period should be permitted to assume jurisdiction of them.&quot;

==The NRA in practice==

The NRA negotiated specific sets of codes with leaders of the nation&#x27;s major industries; the most important provisions were anti-deflationary floors below which no company would lower prices or wages, and agreements on maintaining employment and production. In a remarkably short time, the NRA won agreements from almost every major industry in the nation. According to some conservative economists, the NRA increased the cost of doing business by forty percent. Donald Richberg, who soon replaced Johnson as the head of the NRA said:

There is no choice presented to American business between intelligently planned and uncontrolled industrial operations and a return to the gold-plated anarchy that masqueraded as &quot;rugged individualism.&quot;... Unless industry is sufficiently socialized by its private owners and managers so that great essential industries are operated under public obligation appropriate to the public interest in them, the advance of political control over private industry is inevitable.
By the time it ended in May 1935, industrial production was 22% higher than in May 1933.

===Specific industries===
Pennock (1997) shows that the rubber tire industry faced debilitating challenges, mostly brought about by changes in the industry&#x27;s retail structure and exacerbated by the Depression. Segments of the industry attempted to use the NRA codes to solve these new problems and stabilize the tire market, but the tire manufacturing and tire retailing codes were patent failures. Instead of leading to cartelization and higher prices, which is what most scholars assume the NRA codes did, the tire industry codes led to even more fragmentation and price cutting.

Alexander (1997) examines the macaroni industry and concludes that cost heterogeneity was a major source of the &quot;compliance crisis&quot; affecting a number of NRA &quot;codes of fair competition&quot; that were negotiated by industries and submitted for government approval under the National Industry Recovery Act of 1933. The argument boils down to assumptions that progressives at the NRA allowed majority coalitions of small, high-cost firms to impose codes in heterogeneous industries, and that these codes were designed by the high-cost firms under an ultimately erroneous belief that they would be enforced by the NRA.

Storrs (2000) says the National Consumers&#x27; League (NCL) had been instrumental in the passage and legal defense of labor legislation in many states since 1899. Women activists used the New Deal opportunity to gain a national forum. General Secretary Lucy Randolph Mason and her league relentlessly lobbied the NRA to make its regulatory codes just and fair for all workers and to eliminate explicit and de facto discrimination in pay, working conditions, and opportunities for reasons of sex, race, or union status. Even after the demise of the NRA, the league continued campaigning for collective bargaining rights and fair labor standards at both federal and state levels.

===Enforcement===

About 23 million people were employed under the NRA codes. However, violations of codes became common and attempts were made to use the courts to enforce the NRA. The NRA included a multitude of regulations imposing the pricing and production standards for all sorts of goods and services. Individuals were arrested for not complying with these codes. For example, one small businessman was fined for violating the &quot;Tailor&#x27;s Code&quot; by pressing a suit for 35 rather than NRA required 40 cents. Roosevelt critic John T. Flynn, in &quot;The Roosevelt Myth&quot; (1944), wrote:

The NRA was famous for its bureaucracy. Journalist Raymond Clapper reported that between 4,000 and 5,000 business practices were prohibited by NRA orders that carried the force of law, which were contained in some 3,000 administrative orders running to over 10 million pages, and supplemented by what Clapper said were &quot;innumerable opinions and directions from national, regional and code boards interpreting and enforcing provisions of the act.&quot; There were also &quot;the rules of the code authorities, themselves, each having the force of law and affecting the lives and conduct of millions of persons.&quot; Clapper concluded: &quot;It requires no imagination to appreciate the difficulty the business man has in keeping informed of these codes, supplemental codes, code amendments, executive orders, administrative orders, office orders, interpretations, rules, regulations and obiter dicta.&quot;

==Judicial review==
On May 27, 1935, in the court case of &quot;Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States&quot;, the Supreme Court held the mandatory codes section of NIRA unconstitutional. Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote for a unanimous Court in invalidating the industrial &quot;codes of fair competition&quot; which the NIRA enabled the President to issue. The Court held that the codes violated the United States Constitution&#x27;s separation of powers as an impermissible delegation of legislative power to the executive branch.

The Court also held that the NIRA provisions were in excess of congressional power under the Commerce Clause because they regulated commerce that was not interstate in character. The Court distinguished between direct effects on interstate commerce, which Congress could lawfully regulate, and indirect, which were purely matters of state law. Though the raising and sale of poultry was an interstate industry, the Court found that the &quot;stream of interstate commerce&quot; had stopped in this case: Schechter&#x27;s slaughterhouses bought chickens only from intrastate wholesalers and sold to intrastate buyers. Any interstate effect of Schechter was indirect, and therefore beyond federal reach.

Specifically, the Court invalidated regulations of the poultry industry promulgated under the authority of the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933, including price fixing and wage fixing, as well as requirements regarding a whole shipment of chickens, including unhealthy ones, which led to the case becoming known as &quot;the sick chicken case&quot;. The ruling was one of a series which overturned some New Deal legislation between January 1935 and January 1936.

Subsequent to the decision, the remainder of Title I was extended until April 1, 1936, by joint resolution of Congress (49 Stat. 375), June 14, 1935, and NRA was reorganized by E.O. 7075, June 15, 1935, to facilitate its new role as a promoter of industrial cooperation and to enable it to produce a series of economic studies, which the National Recovery Review Board was already doing. Many of the labor provisions reappeared in the Wagner Act of 1935.

==Legacy==

The NRA tried to end the Great Depression by organizing thousands of businesses under codes drawn up by trade associations and industries. Hugh Johnson proved charismatic in setting up publicity that glorified his new NRA. Johnson was recognized for his efforts when &quot;Time&quot; named him Man of the Year of 1933—choosing him instead of FDR.

By 1934 the enthusiasm that Johnson had so successfully created had faded. Johnson was faltering badly, which historians ascribe to the profound contradictions in NRA policies, compounded by Johnson&#x27;s heavy drinking on the job. Big business and labor unions both turned hostile.

According to biographer John Ohl (as summarized by reviewer Lester V. Chandler): Johnson&#x27;s priorities became evident almost immediately. In the prescription, &quot;Self regulation of industry under government supervision&quot; the emphasis was to be on maximum freedom for business to formulate its own rules with a minimum of government supervision. Consumer protection and the interests of labor were of decidedly lesser importance. To induce business to formulate and abide by codes of fair competition Johnson was willing to condone almost any type of price fixing, restriction of production, limitation of productive capacity, and other types of anti-competitive practices...even with the benefit of a more efficient and diplomatic management and a more tolerant Supreme Court the NRA probably would not have survived much longer. Its inherent conflicts and inconsistencies were just too strong.

Historian William E. Leuchtenburg argued in 1963: The NRA could boast some considerable achievements: it gave jobs to some two million workers; it helped stop a renewal of the deflationary spiral that had
almost wrecked the nation; it did something to improve business ethics and civilize competition; it established a national pattern of maximum hours and minimum wages; and it all but wiped out child labor and the sweatshop. But this was all it did. It prevented things from getting worse, but it did little to speed recovery, and probably actually hindered it by its support of restrictionism and price raising. The NRA could maintain a sense of national interest against private interests only so long as the spirit of national crisis prevailed. As it faded, restriction-minded businessmen moved into a decisive position of authority. By delegating power over price and production to trade associations, the NRA created a series of private economic governments. 
According to historian Ellis Hawley in 1976:at the hands of historians the National Recovery Administration of 1933–35 has fared badly. Cursed at the time, it has remained the epitome of political aberration, illustrative of the pitfalls of “planning” and deplored both for hampering recovery and delaying genuine reform.

<doc id="511676" wikidata="Q1551060" url="?curid=511676" title="Group polarization">
<text>In social psychology, group polarization refers to the tendency for a group to make decisions that are more extreme than the initial inclination of its members. These more extreme decisions are towards greater risk if individuals&#x27; initial tendencies are to be risky and towards greater caution if individuals&#x27; initial tendencies are to be cautious. The phenomenon also holds that a group&#x27;s attitude toward a situation may change in the sense that the individuals&#x27; initial attitudes have strengthened and intensified after group discussion, a phenomenon known as attitude polarization.

== Overview ==
Group polarization is an important phenomenon in social psychology and is observable in many social contexts. For example, a group of women who hold moderately feminist views tend to demonstrate heightened pro-feminist beliefs following group discussion. Similarly, studies have shown that after deliberating together, mock jury members often decided on punitive damage awards that were either larger or smaller than the amount any individual juror had favored prior to deliberation. The studies indicated that when the jurors favored a relatively low award, discussion would lead to an even more lenient result, while if the jury was inclined to impose a stiff penalty, discussion would make it even harsher. Moreover, in recent years, the Internet and online social media have also presented opportunities to observe group polarization and compile new research. Psychologists have found that social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter demonstrate that group polarization can occur even when a group is not physically together. As long as the group of individuals begins with the same fundamental opinion on the topic and a consistent dialogue is kept going, group polarization can occur.

Research has suggested that well-established groups suffer less from polarization, as do groups discussing problems that are well known to them. However, in situations where groups are somewhat newly formed and tasks are new, group polarization can demonstrate a more profound influence on decision-making.

== Attitude polarization ==
Attitude polarization, also known as belief polarization and the polarization effect, is a phenomenon in which a disagreement becomes more extreme as the different parties consider evidence on the issue. It is one of the effects of confirmation bias: the tendency of people to search for and interpret evidence selectively, to reinforce their current beliefs or attitudes. When people encounter ambiguous evidence, this bias can potentially result in each of them interpreting it as in support of their existing attitudes, widening rather than narrowing the disagreement between them.

The effect is observed with issues that activate emotions, such as political &quot;hot-button&quot; issues. For most issues, new evidence does not produce a polarization effect. For those issues where polarization is found, mere thinking about the issue, without contemplating new evidence, produces the effect. Social comparison processes have also been invoked as an explanation for the effect, which is increased by settings in which people repeat and validate each other&#x27;s statements. This apparent tendency is of interest not only to psychologists, but also to sociologists and philosophers.

=== Empirical findings ===
Since the late 1960s, psychologists have carried out a number of studies on various aspects of attitude polarization.

In 1979, Charles Lord, Lee Ross and Mark Lepper performed a study in which they selected two groups of people, one group strongly in favor of capital punishment, the other strongly opposed. The researchers initially measured the strength with which people held their position. Later, both the pro- and anti-capital punishment people were put into small groups and shown one of two cards, each containing a statement about the results of a research project written on it. For example:Kroner and Phillips (1977) compared murder rates for the year before and the year after adoption of capital punishment in 14 states. In 11 of the 14 states, murder rates were lower after adoption of the death penalty. This research supports the deterrent effect of the death penalty.or:Palmer and Crandall (1977) compared murder rates in 10 pairs of neighboring states with different capital punishment laws. In 8 of the 10 pairs, murder rates were higher in the state with capital punishment. This research opposes the deterrent effect of the death penalty.The researchers again asked people about the strength of their beliefs about the deterrence effect of the death penalty, and, this time, also asked them about the effect that the research had had on their attitudes.

In the next stage of the research, the participants were given more information about the study described on the card they received, including details of the research, critiques of the research, and the researchers&#x27; responses to those critiques. The participants&#x27; degree of commitment to their original positions were re-measured, and the participants were asked about the quality of the research and the effect the research had on their beliefs. Finally, the trial was rerun on all participants using a card that supported the opposite position to that they had initially seen.

The researchers found that people tended to believe that research that supported their original views had been better conducted and was more convincing than research that didn&#x27;t. Whichever position they held initially, people tended to hold that position more strongly after reading research that supported it. Lord &quot;et al.&quot; point out that it is reasonable for people to be less critical of research that supports their current position, but it seems less rational for people to significantly increase the strength of their attitudes when they read supporting evidence. When people had read both the research that supported their views and the research that did not, they tended to hold their original attitudes &quot;more&quot; strongly than before they received that information. These results should be understood in the context of several problems in the implementation of the study, including the fact the researchers changed the scaling of the outcome of the variable, so measuring attitude change was impossible, and measured polarization using a subjective assessment of attitude change and not a direct measure of how much change had occurred.

== Choice shifts ==
Group polarization and choice shifts are similar in many ways; however, they differ in one distinct way. &quot;Group polarization&quot; refers to attitude change on the individual level due to the influence of the group, and &quot;choice shift&quot; refers to the outcome of that attitude change; namely, the difference between the average group members&#x27; pre-group discussion attitudes and the outcome of the group decision.

Risky and cautious shifts are both a part of a more generalized idea known as group-induced attitude polarization. Though group polarization deals mainly with risk-involving decisions and/or opinions, discussion-induced shifts have been shown to occur on several non-risk-involving levels. This suggests that a general phenomenon of choice-shifts exists apart from only risk-related decisions. Stoner (1968) found that a decision is impacted by the values behind that circumstances of the decision. The study found that situations that normally favor the more risky alternative increased risky shifts. More so, situations that normally favor the cautious alternative increased cautious shifts. These findings also show the importance of previous group shifts. Choice shifts are mainly explained by largely differing human values and how highly these values are held by an individual. According to Moscovici et al. (1972) interaction within a group and differences of opinion are necessary for group polarization to take place. While an extremist in the group may sway opinion, the shift can only occur with sufficient and proper interaction within the group. In other words, the extremist will have no impact without interaction. Also, Moscovici et al. found individual preferences to be irrelevant; it is differences of opinion which will cause the shift. This finding demonstrates how one opinion in the group will not sway the group; it is the combination of all the individual opinions that will make an impact.

== History and origins==
The study of group polarization can be traced back to an unpublished 1961 Master&#x27;s thesis by MIT student James Stoner, who observed the so-called &quot;risky shift&quot;. The concept of risky shift maintains that a group&#x27;s decisions are riskier than the average of the individual decisions of members before the group met.

In early studies, the risky-shift phenomenon was measured using a scale known as the Choice-Dilemmas Questionnaire. This measure required participants to consider a hypothetical scenario in which an individual is faced with a dilemma and must make a choice to resolve the issue at hand. Participants were then asked to estimate the probability that a certain choice would be of benefit or risk to the individual being discussed. Consider the following example:&quot;Mr. A, an electrical engineer, who is married and has one child, has been working for a large electronics corporation since graduating from college five years ago. He is assured of a lifetime job with a modest, though adequate, salary and liberal pension benefits upon retirement. On the other hand, it is very unlikely that his salary will increase much before he retires. While attending a convention, Mr. A is offered a job with a small, newly founded company which has a highly uncertain future. The new job would pay more to start and would offer the possibility of a share in the owner- ship if the company survived the competition of the larger firms.&quot;Participants were then asked to imagine that they were advising Mr. A. They would then be provided with a series of probabilities that indicate whether the new company that offered him a position is financially stable. It would read as following

&quot;Please check the lowest probability that you would consider acceptable to make it worthwhile for Mr. A to take the new job.&quot;

____The chances are 1 in 10 that the company will prove financially sound.

____The chances are 3 in 10 that the company will prove financially sound.

____The chances are 5 in 10 that the company will prove financially sound.

____The chances are 7 in 10 that the company will prove financially sound.

____The chances are 9 in 10 that the company will prove financially sound.

____Place a check here if you think Mr. A should not take the new job no matter what the probabilities.

Individuals completed the questionnaire and made their decisions independently of others. Later, they would be asked to join a group to reassess their choices. Indicated by shifts in the mean value, initial studies using this method revealed that group decisions tended to be relatively riskier than those that were made by individuals. This tendency also occurred when individual judgments were collected after the group discussion and even when the individual post-discussion measures were delayed two to six weeks.

The discovery of the risky shift was considered surprising and counter-intuitive, especially since earlier work in the 1920s and 1930s by Allport and other researchers suggested that individuals made more extreme decisions than did groups, leading to the expectation that groups would make decisions that would conform to the average risk level of its members. The seemingly counter-intuitive findings of Stoner led to a spurt of research around the risky shift, which was originally thought to be a special case exception to the standard decision-making practice. Many people had concluded that people in a group setting would make decisions based on what they assumed to be the overall risk level of a group; because Stoner&#x27;s work did not necessarily address this specific theme, and because it does seem to contrast Stoner&#x27;s initial definition of risky shift, additional controversy arose leading researchers to further examine the topic. By the late 1960s, however, it had become clear that the risky shift was just one type of many attitudes that became more extreme in groups, leading Moscovici and Zavalloni to term the overall phenomenon &quot;group polarization.&quot;

Subsequently, a decade-long period of examination of the applicability of group polarization to a number of fields in both lab and field settings began. There is a substantial amount of empirical evidence demonstrating the phenomenon of group polarization. Group polarization has been widely considered as a fundamental group decision-making process and was well established, but remained non-obvious and puzzling because its mechanisms were not fully understood.

== Major theoretical approaches ==
Almost as soon as the phenomenon of group polarization was discovered, a number of theories were offered to help explain and account for it. These explanations were gradually narrowed down and grouped together until two primary mechanisms remained, social comparison and informational influence.

===Social comparison theory===
The social comparison theory, or normative influence theory, has been widely used to explain group polarization. According to the social comparison interpretation, group polarization occurs as a result of individuals&#x27; desire to gain acceptance and be perceived in a favorable way by their group. The theory holds that people first compare their own ideas with those held by the rest of the group; they observe and evaluate what the group values and prefers. In order to gain acceptance, people then take a position that is similar to everyone else&#x27;s but slightly more extreme. In doing so, individuals support the group&#x27;s beliefs while still presenting themselves as admirable group &quot;leaders&quot;. The presence of a member with an extreme viewpoint or attitude does not further polarize the group. Studies regarding the theory have demonstrated that normative influence is more likely with judgmental issues, a group goal of harmony, person-oriented group members, and public responses.

===Informational influence===
Informational influence, or persuasive arguments theory, has also been used to explain group polarization, and is most recognized by psychologists today. The persuasive arguments interpretation holds that individuals become more convinced of their views when they hear novel arguments in support of their position. The theory posits that each group member enters the discussion aware of a set of items of information or arguments favoring both sides of the issue, but lean toward that side that boasts the greater amount of information. In other words, individuals base their individual choices by weighing remembered pro and con arguments. Some of these items or arguments are shared among the members while some items are unshared, in which all but one member has considered these arguments before. Assuming most or all group members lean in the same direction, during discussion, items of unshared information supporting that direction are expressed, which provides members previously unaware of them more reason to lean in that direction. Group discussion shifts the weight of evidence as each group member expresses their arguments, shedding light onto a number of different positions and ideas. Research has indicated that informational influence is more likely with intellective issues, a group goal of making correct decision, task-oriented group members, and private responses. Furthermore, research suggests that it is not simply the sharing of information that predicts group polarization. Rather, the amount of information and persuasiveness of the arguments mediate the level of polarization experienced.

In the 1970s, significant arguments occurred over whether persuasive argumentation alone accounted for group polarization. Daniel Isenberg&#x27;s 1986 meta-analysis of the data gathered by both the persuasive argument and social comparison camps succeeded, in large part, in answering the questions about predominant mechanisms. Isenberg concluded that there was substantial evidence that both effects were operating simultaneously, and that persuasive arguments theory operated when social comparison did not, and vice versa.

===Self-categorization and social identity===
While these two theories are the most widely accepted as explanations for group polarization, alternative theories have been proposed. The most popular of these theories is self-categorization theory. Self-categorization theory stems from social identity theory, which holds that conformity stems from psychological processes; that is, being a member of a group is defined as the subjective perception of the self as a member of a specific category. Accordingly, proponents of the self-categorization model hold that group polarization occurs because individuals identify with a particular group and conform to a prototypical group position that is more extreme than the group mean. In contrast to social comparison theory and persuasive argumentation theory, the self-categorization model maintains that inter-group categorization processes are the cause of group polarization 

Support for the self-categorization theory, which explains group polarization as conformity to a polarized norm, was found by Hogg, Turner, and Davidson in 1990. In their experiment, participants gave pre-test, post-test, and group consensus recommendations on three choice dilemma item-types (risky, neutral, or cautious). The researchers hypothesized that an ingroup confronted by a risky outgroup will polarize toward caution, an ingroup confronted by a caution outgroup will polarize toward risk, and an ingroup in the middle of the social frame of reference, confronted by both risky and cautious outgroups, will not polarize but will converge on its pre-test mean. The results of the study supported their hypothesis in that participants converged on a norm polarized toward risk on risky items and toward caution on cautious items. Another similar study found that in-group prototypes become more polarized as the group becomes more extreme in the social context. This further lends support to the self-categorization explanation of group polarization.

==Applications==

===The Internet===
The rising popularity and increased number of online social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, has enabled people to seek out and share ideas with others who have similar interests and common values, making group polarization effects increasingly evident, particularly in generation Y and generation Z individuals. Similar to the social media platforms, video streaming platforms like YouTube are forming groups unconsciously through intelligent algorithm seeking for extreme contents. Owing to this technology, it is possible for individuals to curate their sources of information and the opinions to which they are exposed, thereby reinforcing and strengthening their own views while effectively avoiding information and perspectives with which they disagree.

One study analyzed over 30,000 tweets on Twitter regarding the shooting of George Tiller, a late term abortion doctor, where the tweets analyzed were conversations among supporters and opponents of abortion rights, post shooting. The study found that like-minded individuals strengthened group identity whereas replies between different-minded individuals reinforced a split in affiliation.

In a study conducted by Sia et al. (2002), group polarization was found to occur with online (computer-mediated) discussions. In particular, this study found that group discussions, conducted when discussants are in a distributed (cannot see one another) or anonymous (cannot identify one another) environment, can lead to even higher levels of group polarization compared to traditional meetings. This is attributed to the greater numbers of novel arguments generated (due to persuasive arguments theory) and higher incidence of one-upmanship behaviors (due to social comparison).

However, some research suggests that important differences arise in measuring group polarization in laboratory versus field experiments. A study conducted by Taylor &amp; MacDonald (2002) featured a realistic setting of a computer-mediated discussion, but group polarization did not occur at the level expected. The study&#x27;s results also showed that groupthink occurs less in computer-mediated discussions than when people are face to face. Moreover, computer-mediated discussions often fail to result in a group consensus, or lead to less satisfaction with the consensus that was reached, compared to groups operating in a natural environment. Furthermore, the experiment took place over a two-week period, leading the researchers to suggest that group polarization may occur only in the short-term. Overall, the results suggest that not only may group polarization not be as prevalent as previous studies suggest, but group theories, in general, may not be simply transferable when seen in a computer-related discussion.

===Politics and law===
Group polarization has been widely discussed in terms of political behavior (see political polarization). Researchers have identified an increase in affective polarization among the United States electorate, and report that hostility and discrimination towards the opposing political party has increased dramatically over time.

Group polarization is similarly influential in legal contexts. A study that assessed whether Federal district court judges behaved differently when they sat alone, or in small groups, demonstrated that those judges who sat alone took extreme action 35% of the time, whereas judges who sat in a group of three took extreme action 65% of the time. These results are noteworthy because they indicate that even trained, professional decision-makers are subject to the influences of group polarization.

===War and violent behavior===
Group polarization has been reported to occur during wartime and other times of conflict and helps to account partially for violent behavior and conflict. Researchers have suggested, for instance, that ethnic conflict exacerbates group polarization by enhancing identification with the ingroup and hostility towards the outgroup. While polarization can occur in any type of conflict, it has its most damaging effects in large-scale inter-group, public policy, and international conflicts.

===College life===
On a smaller scale, group polarization can also be seen in the everyday lives of students in higher education. A study by Myers in 2005 reported that initial differences among American college students become more accentuated over time. For example, students who do not belong to fraternities and sororities tend to be more liberal politically, and this difference increases over the course of their college careers. Researchers theorize that this is at least partially explained by group polarization, as group members tend to reinforce one another&#x27;s proclivities and opinions.

<doc id="511678" wikidata="Q1461465" url="?curid=511678" title="Manchester Arena">
<text>Manchester Arena (currently known as AO Arena for sponsorship reasons) is an indoor arena in Manchester, England, immediately north of the city centre and partly above Manchester Victoria station in air rights space. Prior to the opening of Co-op Live, the arena had the highest seating capacity of any indoor venue in the United Kingdom, and is the fourth-largest in Europe with a capacity of 21,000.

The arena is one of the world&#x27;s busiest indoor arenas, hosting music and sporting events such as boxing and swimming. The arena was a key part of Manchester&#x27;s bids to host the Olympic Games in 1996 and 2000 and was eventually used for the 2002 Commonwealth Games.

The arena was temporarily closed following a terror attack on 22 May 2017, in which suicide bomber Salman Abedi killed 22 people, and injured 500 more, at the end of an Ariana Grande concert during her Dangerous Woman Tour. Shows and events that were scheduled to take place at the arena were either moved to alternative venues, or cancelled completely. The arena was reopened on 9 September with a special benefit concert headlined by Manchester-born singer Noel Gallagher.

==Arena design==
First proposed during the regeneration of Manchester city centre during the 1980s, the structure was designed by DLA Ellerbe Beckett, Ove Arup &amp; Partners, and Austin-Smith:Lord. The arena is sited in air rights space over the Manchester Victoria railway station and was constructed without disrupting use of the station. The original plans included a glass tower which was not built. It originally hosted a seven-screen multiplex cinema, a multi-purpose arena and multi-storey parking. The former multiplex cinema, which opened in 1996, closed after just four years and is now a call centre. Following the bombing, the foyer underwent renovation.

A large truss measuring spans the roof. Reinforced concrete is used to increase sound insulation. The upper parts of the building are clad in purple-grey with green glass. The arena was opened on 15 July 1995.

The arena is the only indoor venue in the UK to be built following a layout of 360-degree seating. (London&#x27;s The O2, formerly the Millennium Dome, also has 360-degree seating, but only on its lower tier, whereas Manchester&#x27;s arena features it on both tiers). Other European indoor venues built to the same concept include the Lanxess Arena (Cologne, Germany), Arena Zagreb (Zagreb, Croatia), Spaladium Arena (Split, Croatia), Kombank Arena (Belgrade, Serbia), O2 Arena (Prague, Czech Republic), and the Barclaycard Arena (Hamburg, Germany).

A three-year £50million re-development started in 2022. The arena&#x27;s capacity will increase to 24,000, and new public entrances and custom lounges will be opened. Once complete, the increase in capacity will retain the indoor arena&#x27;s place as the largest in the city after the 23,500-seat Co-op Live Arena opened.

==Background==
The arena was constructed as part of the city&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics. Construction cost £52 million of which £35.5m was provided by government grants and £2.5m from the European Regional Development Fund. Although built as an American style sports arena, it has been more successful hosting large music events.

The arena opened in July 1995, sponsored by NYNEX CableComms as NYNEX Arena. In July 1998, it was renamed the Manchester Evening News Arena, or just the &quot;MEN Arena&quot;, when it was sponsored by the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; newspaper. In December 2011, the newspaper ended its 13 year sponsorship, and the arena was renamed Manchester Arena in January 2012. In July 2013, the arena was renamed Phones 4u Arena after the mobile phone company Phones 4u, but this deal ended in January 2015 after Phones 4u went out of business, renaming the arena back to Manchester Arena. In September 2020, the arena was rebranded as the AO Arena as part of a five year sponsorship deal by the online electricals retailer AO.

On the opening night, 15,000 spectators watched Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean perform. The crowd was a record for an ice event. Attendance records were set in 1997 when 17,425 people watched Manchester Storm play Sheffield Steelers, a record for an ice hockey match in Europe at that time. When 14,151 people watched Manchester Giants play London Leopards, it set a British record for attendance at a basketball match. The venue attracts over a million customers each year for concerts and family shows, making it one of the world&#x27;s busiest indoor arenas, and was named &quot;International Venue Of The Year&quot; in 2002 in the &#x27;Pollstar&#x27; awards, and was nominated in the same category from 2002 to 2009. The arena was named &quot;Busiest Arena Venue In The World&quot;, based on ticket sales for concerts from 2003 to 2007, ahead of other indoor arenas including Madison Square Garden and Wembley Arena. The arena was the &#x27;World&#x27;s Busiest Arena&#x27; from 2001 until 2007 based on ticket sales for concerts, attracting five and a half million customers. It was voted &#x27;Europe&#x27;s Favourite Arena&#x27; at the TPi Awards in 2008 by the touring companies that bring the shows to the venue.

On the evening of 27 May 1999, a reception was held at the arena to celebrate Manchester United&#x27;s UEFA Champions League triumph in Barcelona 24 hours earlier, following the victorious side&#x27;s parade around Manchester at the end of the season in which they became the first English team to win the treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League in the same season, which remained the case until Manchester City achieved the same feat in 2022-23.

In 2008, the arena was the world&#x27;s third busiest arena behind London&#x27;s The O2 Arena and New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. In 2009, it was the world&#x27;s second busiest arena behind The O2, and ahead of the Sportpaleis in Antwerp and Madison Square Garden in New York City. Although second to London&#x27;s The O2, Manchester&#x27;s arena had its busiest year with over 1,500,000 people attending concerts and family shows. The arena hosts over 250 events annually including comedy, live music and tours, sporting events, and occasionally musicals.

==Events==

===Music===
As one of the largest venues in the UK, the arena has hosted music concerts since opening in 1995.

As of 2019, British pop group Take That, who were formed in Manchester, hold the record for the most performances, with 46. During the five-concert Manchester leg of their 2019 tour, the arena was temporarily renamed after the band to honour their 30-year career. Irish pop group Westlife previously held the record with 33 performances.

Spice Girls performed 4 sold-out shows during their Spiceworld Tour in April 1998, 4 sold-out shows in December 1999 on the Christmas in Spiceworld Tour, and 3 sold-out shows in January 2008 on The Return of the Spice Girls World Tour.

Led Zeppelin legends Jimmy Page and Robert Plant performed a sell out concert at the arena on 3 November 1998 as part of their Walking into Clarksdale tour.

On 26 March 2000, English boy band Five performed at this venue as part of their Invincible Tour. The show was also filmed for a concert special called &quot;Five Live&quot; that was released on DVD and VHS later that same year.

Janet Jackson performed here on 31 May 1998 as part of her The Velvet Rope Tour. Jackson was scheduled to perform during her All for You Tour on 5 December 2001, but the show was cancelled with the rest of her European tour because of possible terrorist threats. Her 2016 Unbreakable World Tour was also cancelled, this time because of scheduling conflicts.

Britney Spears performed at the arena for the first time for two sold-out shows on 13 and 14 October 2000 during her Oops!...I Did It Again Tour. She has returned for additional sold-out shows on 1 May 2004 during Onyx Hotel Tour, 17 June 2009 during her Circus Tour, in 2011 for the Femme Fatale Tour, and on 18 August 2018 as part of her Piece of Me Tour.

U2 performed at the arena on 11 and 12 August 2001, for their Elevation Tour. The band came back in 2018 during their Experience + Innocence Tour for two shows on 19 and 20 October.
In 2002, Kylie Minogue performed for six shows as part of her KylieFever2002 tour. She returned for five sold-out shows in April 2005 as part of her . In 2007, she performed for seven sold-out shows in January as part of her . In 2008, she returned for six sold-out shows in July as part of her KylieX2008 tour. Minogue performed for four shows in April 2011 as part of her . Minogue performed again at the arena on 26 September 2014. The performance marked the 30th time Minogue has performed at the arena. It is a record for Minogue as the venue she has played to most in the world; she has played to 400,000 fans in total in the Manchester Arena.

Barbadian singer Rihanna would perform her first concert in England here, as part of her worldwide Good Girl Gone Bad Tour that ran September 2006 to January 2009, starting and ending in North America. The full concert, named Good Girl Gone Bad Live was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 9 June 2008, by Def Jam Recordings. The concert promoted the songs from the album of the same name, however, also featured songs by Rihanna&#x27;s two previous albums &quot;Music of the Sun&quot; (2005) and &quot;A Girl like Me&quot; (2006).

Madonna performed twice on her Re-Invention World Tour in Summer 2004, returning in 2009, on the second leg of the Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour.

<text>Asplenium platyneuron (syn. &quot;Asplenium ebeneum&quot;), commonly known as ebony spleenwort or brownstem spleenwort, is a fern native to North America east of the Rocky Mountains. It takes its common name from its dark, reddish-brown, glossy stipe and rachis (leaf stalk and midrib), which support a once-divided, pinnate leaf. The fertile fronds, which die off in the winter, are darker green and stand upright, while the sterile fronds are evergreen and lie flat on the ground. An auricle at the base of each pinna points towards the tip of the frond. The dimorphic fronds and alternate, rather than opposite, pinnae distinguish it from the similar black-stemmed spleenwort.

The species was first described in 1753 by Linnaeus as &quot;Acrostichum platyneuros&quot;, although Linnaeus&#x27; type drew on material from several other species as well. It was more commonly called &quot;Asplenium ebeneum&quot;, a name published by William Aiton in 1789, until the rediscovery and revival of the Linnaean epithet in the late nineteenth century. Several forms and varieties of the species have been described, but few are recognized today; in particular, larger and more fertile specimens, those with more or less toothed leaves, and those with proliferating buds are considered to fall within the natural range of variation of the species, and do not require taxonomic distinction. &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; f. &quot;hortonae&quot;, a sterile form with the pinnae cut to toothed pinnules, and f. &quot;furcatum&quot;, with forking fronds, are still recognized.

The formation of proliferating buds is one of several unusual adaptations for reproduction in this species. The buds form near the base of the stipe, and when covered with soil, can grow into new individuals as the frond that bore them dies. Ebony spleenwort is also well-adapted to propagate by spores: the upright sterile fronds help the spores enter the airstream for long-distance dispersal, and a low genetic load allows spores that have grown into a gametophyte to self-fertilize with a high degree of success. This dispersal ability seems to have helped the species spread rapidly in the Great Lakes region in the late 20th century. Long-distance dispersal may also explain its naturalized appearance in South Africa, and the existence of an isolated population found in Slovakia in 2009, its first known occurrence in Europe.

Ebony spleenwort has broad habitat preferences, growing both on rocks like many other North American spleenworts and in a variety of soils. Unlike many other spleenworts, it is not particularly sensitive to soil pH. It hybridizes with several other spleenworts, particularly mountain spleenwort and walking fern; these species, their sterile hybrid offspring, fertile allotetraploid hybrids, and backcrosses between allotetraploids and the parents are collectively known as the &quot;Appalachian &quot;Asplenium&quot; complex&quot;. Two hybrids between &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; and spleenworts outside of this complex are also known.

==Description==
Ebony spleenwort is a small fern with pinnate fronds, growing in tufts, with a shiny reddish-brown stipe and rachis. The fronds are dimorphic, with long, erect, dark green fertile fronds, which are deciduous, and shorter, spreading, lighter green sterile fronds, which are evergreen.

===Roots and rhizomes===
This fern does not spread and form new plants via the roots. The rhizome, from or perhaps in diameter, bears a few narrowly linear-deltate scales, black to dark brown in color and strongly clathrate (bearing a lattice-like pattern). The scales are or long and wide, with margins entire (untoothed) or very nearly so.

===Leaves===
The stipe (the stalk of the leaf, below the blade) is long, and comprises one-quarter to one-third of the length of the blade. It lacks wings, and is a shiny reddish-brown or blackish-brown throughout its length. Towards the base, it has a few threadlike scales similar in color to those of the rhizome. Starch granules are stored in tissue at the base of the stipe and, to a lesser extent, in the rhizome, giving the bases an enlarged appearance and a firm texture. The stipe bases are long-lived and may survive the disintegration of the rest of the stipe and the blade.

The leaf blade of ebony spleenwort is linear to narrowly oblanceolate (slightly wider in the upper half of the blade) in shape, measuring from long and from wide, sometimes as wide as . It is acute (pointed) at its tip and gradually tapers at its base. The blade is shiny and has a few scattered hairs, or lacks them entirely. The rachis (leaf axis), like the stipe, is reddish-, purplish- or blackish-brown, shiny and hairless.

The blade is cut into pinnae (leaflets) throughout its length, from 15 to 45 pairs per leaf. The pinnae are distinctly alternate along the rachis. They are oblong (roughly rectangular) or quadrangular in shape, sometimes somewhat falcate and angled towards the leaf base, those in the middle of the leaf blade measuring from in length and from in width. Each pinna has an obvious auricle at its base, pointing towards the tip of the blade and overlapping the rachis. Sometimes a small auricle pointing at the base of the blade is present as well The edges of the pinnae are crenate or serrulate (bearing rounded or small sharp teeth); they are more deeply cut in small forms. The tips of the pinnae may be acute or obtuse (blunt. On the underside of the blade, veins are clearly visible and free (they do not anastomose or rejoin each other). A few minute scales may also be scattered on the underside.

===Sori and spores===
Pinnae of the fertile fronds carry from one to twelve, or even eighteen, pairs of sori on their underside, each long. Each pair of sori forms a chevron, pointing towards the base of the pinna along its midvein, on which they are centered. An indusium covers each sorus; these are whitish and translucent or silvery with a slightly toothed or erose (irregularly jagged) edge, soon withering to reveal the sori. Each sporangium in a sorus carries 64 spores. The diploid sporophyte has a chromosome number of 72.

The light to dark brown spores are monolete, with a straight laesura with a margo (raised border). They are 41 to 52 microns long along their long axis. The perine (outermost layer of the spore) appears spiny, with rough ridges forming a netted pattern. The region of the perine between ridges has a smooth, rather than granular, texture.

===Proliferating buds===
Ebony spleenwort is capable of proliferating by forming new plantlets from buds on the rachis at the base of the plant. These allow new individuals to form at different levels when prostrate fronds become buried in the leaf litter. Wagner &amp; Johnson found proliferous buds in almost every site in the Great Lakes populations they studied; very rarely did more than one bud per plant occur. They occurred, on average, on 1 out of 6 plants, both on sterile and fertile fronds, and their position at the base of the lowest pinnae made them difficult to find among the cluster of fronds. The buds are button-like, pale in color, and appear on the upper side of the lowest pinnae. Each bud contains a shoot and one or sometimes two leaf primordia, covered in clathrate scales, occasionally with roots if the bud has begun to develop. Contact with soil at the plant base stimulates their development, and the decay of their connection with the parental leaf results in the development of a new plant. Similar buds have also been reported from the single-sorus spleenwort, &quot;Asplenium monanthes&quot;.

===Identification===
The species most similar to &quot;Asplenium platyneuron&quot; is the black-stemmed spleenwort, &quot;A. resiliens&quot;. However, this stipe of this species is darker, and the pinnae are opposite, rather than alternate, along the rachis. Maidenhair spleenwort, &quot;A. trichomanes&quot;, is also pinnately cut with a dark, glossy rachis, but the pinnae are oval and somewhat rounded rather than broadly oblong, usually less than two times as long as wide. Neither of these two species, nor the other pinnate American spleenworts, have dimorphic fertile and sterile fronds. It is very similar to Boydston&#x27;s spleenwort, &quot;Asplenium × boydstoniae&quot;, an extremely rare backcross with Tutwiler&#x27;s spleenwort, &quot;Asplenium tutwilerae&quot;; however, Boydston&#x27;s spleenwort has an elongated, acute frond tip similar to that of Tutwiler&#x27;s spleenwort. Among similar South African spleenworts, &quot;A. lunulatum&quot; has proliferating frond tips, while &quot;A. monanthes&quot; has only one sorus on each pinna.

Among the larger ferns, &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; might be confused with a young Christmas fern, &quot;Polystichum acrostichoides&quot;, but that species is generally much larger and has a green, scaly stipe and rachis. Fishbone fern, &quot;Nephrolepis cordifolia&quot;, is likewise larger, with yellowish-green pinnae and a green rachis.

==Taxonomy==
This species is commonly known as &quot;ebony spleenwort&quot; or &quot;brownstem spleenwort&quot; for the dark color of its stipe and rachis.

The basionym for the species is &quot;Acrostichum platyneuros&quot;, published by Linnaeus in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753 (the official starting point of modern botanical nomenclature). Linnaeus&#x27; treatment came from a 1745 dissertation by his student J. B. Heiligtag, which in turn drew on the descriptions by several earlier authorities. The first description listed was that of Jan Gronovius, botanist and mentor of Linnaeus, in his &quot;Flora Virginica&quot; of 1743, based on a specimen collected by the collector John Clayton. The specific epithet &quot;platyneuros&quot; (&quot;flat nerves&quot;) was drawn from a description by the botanist Leonard Plukenet in his &quot;Almagestum&quot; of 1696. Unfortunately, only Clayton&#x27;s specimen, now the lectotype for the species, represents the species now known as &quot;Asplenium platyneuron&quot;; the specimens upon which the other descriptions are based, including that of Plukenet which yielded the specific epithet, are a mixture of &quot;Pleopeltis polypodioides&quot; and &quot;Polypodium virginianum&quot; &quot;sensu lato&quot;. In 1789, the species was independently described by William Aiton in &quot;Hortus Kewensis&quot;, and given the name &quot;Asplenium ebeneum&quot;, referring to the ebony color of its stalk. The species was also independently described by Olof Swartz in 1801, as &quot;Asplenium polypodioides&quot;, and by André Michaux in 1803 as &quot;Asplenium trichomanoides&quot;; both these names were reduced to synonymy with &quot;Asplenium ebeneum&quot; by Carl Ludwig Willdenow. The name &quot;Asplenium trichomanoides&quot;, however, had already been used by Linnaeus in 1767, making Michaux&#x27;s name a &quot;nomen illegitimum&quot;.

It was Aiton&#x27;s epithet, &quot;ebeneum&quot;, that was used by American botanists throughout most of the 19th century. The transfer of Linnaeus&#x27; specific epithet to form the name &quot;Asplenium platyneuron&quot; was mooted by D. C. Eaton in 1878, who attributed the combination to a pencil notation by William Oakes in the margin of a copy of &quot;Flora Virginica&quot;. Therefore, the combination has historically been attributed to Oakes or Oakes ex D.C.Eaton. However, in 1981, David B. Lellinger pointed out that Eaton had not, in fact, accepted the combination in 1878, preferring the more descriptive epithet &quot;ebeneum&quot; to the less accurate through senior &quot;platyneuron&quot;. Eaton&#x27;s use, therefore, was to be treated as provisional, and not as a published combination by him. Eaton aside, the first valid publication of &quot;Asplenium platyneuron&quot; was that of Britton, Emerson E. Sterns, and Justus F. Poggenburg in 1888, which implicitly references Linnaeus&#x27;s basionym. Despite the revival of Linnaeus&#x27; epithet, the name &quot;Asplenium ebeneum&quot; continued to be widely used through 1896, when Lucien Underwood, in Britton &amp; Brown&#x27;s &quot;Illustrated Flora&quot;, used the name &quot;Asplenium platyneuron&quot; with explicit reference to the basionym.

The species has twice been placed in genera segregated from &quot;Asplenium&quot;: as &quot;Chamaefilix platyneuros&quot; by Oliver A. Farwell in 1931, and as &quot;Tarachia platyneura&quot; by Sizuo Momose in 1960. Neither combination was widely accepted and current authorities do not recognize these genera.

A global phylogeny of &quot;Asplenium&quot; published in 2020 divided the genus into eleven clades, which were given informal names pending further taxonomic study. &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; belongs to the &quot;&quot;A. incisum&quot; subclade&quot; of the &quot;&quot;Schaffneria&quot; clade&quot;. The &quot;Schaffneria&quot; clade has a worldwide distribution, and members vary widely in form and habitat. There is no clear morphological feature that has evolved within the &quot;A. incisum&quot; subclade to define it, but members of the subclade do share a chestnut-brown stipe base. Relationships within the clade are not well-resolved; it includes species from South America, Europe, and China, but no other North American species.

===Forms and varieties===
Three varieties were recognized by Carl Taylor &quot;et al.&quot; in 1976 in their treatment of the species: &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; var. &quot;platyneuron&quot;, the typical variety, &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; var. &quot;incisum&quot;, with more deeply cut pinnae, and &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; var. &quot;bacculum-rubrum&quot;, larger and more fertile than the others with toothed pinnae. However, they note that both these varieties intergrade, and &quot;Flora of North America&quot; does not recognize any infraspecific taxa. In addition to these varieties, three forms were recognized by Taylor &quot;et al.&quot; &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; f. &quot;proliferum&quot;, discussed below, is not recognized by later treatments. &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; f. &quot;hortonae&quot; is only known from sporadic, sterile specimens, with pinnae imbricate and deeply cut and lobed. In &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; f. &quot;furcatum&quot;, the rachis is multiply branched near the tip, but the form appears otherwise normal.

&quot;Asplenium ebeneum&quot; var. &quot;bacculum-rubrum&quot; was first described in 1871 by Americus Featherman. His epithet refers to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he found it growing at the edges of cultivated fields and canebrakes. He described it as standing from high, with twenty to thirty &quot;elongated&quot; sori on each pinna. A large variety of &quot;Asplenium platyneuron&quot; found throughout the southeastern United States, with distinct rather than confluent sori, was described by M. L. Fernald in 1935 as &quot;Asplenium platyneuron&quot; var. &quot;euroaustrinum&quot;, who was then unaware of Featherman&#x27;s publication. He subsequently deemed the two to be identical, and transferred Featherman&#x27;s variety to &quot;A. platyneuron&quot;, as &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; var. &quot;bacculum-rubrum&quot;, in 1936. According to Taylor &quot;et al.&quot;, this variety may be recognized by a longest pinna length greater than and the almost universal presence of sori on erect fronds. They described it as bearing fertile fronds up to , with as many as seventy pinnae, and a coarse appearance with roughly toothed leaf edges intergrading with &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; var. &quot;incisum&quot;. Herb Wagner and David M. Johnson, who collected similar material in Cass County, Michigan (well to the northwest of the supposed range of the variety) did not consider morphological variation in var. &quot;bacculum-rubrum&quot; to be distinct from typical material except for its size, and recommended it be given taxonomic status no higher than that of a form, if recognized at all.

&quot;Asplenium ebeneum&quot; var. &quot;incisum&quot; was collected by Elliot C. Howe in Poestenkill, New York and described in 1869 by Charles H. Peck. Although described as having pinnae largely &quot;incised-pinnatifid&quot;, most of the pinnae in the type material are doubly serrate (toothed) or serrate-incised. In 1873, Elihu S. Miller collected fronds from Wading River, New York which were wider than usual and sharply serrate. This he named &quot;Asplenium ebeneum&quot; var. &quot;serratum&quot;, at the suggestion of Asa Gray. Although Miller&#x27;s type material has not been located, specimens determined as var. &quot;serratum&quot; by Gray were found by Taylor &quot;et al.&quot; to be indistinguishable from var. &quot;incisum&quot;. However, both epithets continued to be recognized by authors for some time. Britton, Sterns and Poggenburg transferred var. &quot;serratum&quot; as &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; var. &quot;serratum&quot; in 1888; Willard Clute lowered its rank to become &quot;A. ebeneum&quot; f. &quot;serratum&quot; in 1901, and the combination at this rank was transferred to &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; by Ralph Hoffmann in 1922. Benjamin Lincoln Robinson transferred var. &quot;incisum&quot; to &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; in 1908, and Farwell recognized var. &quot;serratum&quot; when he segregated &quot;Chamaefilix&quot; from &quot;Asplenium&quot; in 1931. Edgar T. Wherry, in 1940, synonymized not only var. &quot;serratum&quot; with var. &quot;incisum&quot;, but included var. &quot;bacculum-rubrum&quot; and var. &quot;euroaustrinum&quot; under that epithet. He also created the epithet var. &quot;typicum&quot; for the normal form of ebony spleenwort. Taylor &quot;et al.&quot;, reviewing these treatments, distinguished var. &quot;incisum&quot; as having doubly serrate pinnae cut less than 80% of the way to the costa, with normal fertility (unlike the sterile &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; f. &quot;hortonae&quot;). As these plants occur throughout the range of the species intermixed with typical specimens and intergrading with them morphologically, Wagner and Johnson did not think them worth of taxonomic recognition.

Another taxon characterized by deeply incised margins was described in 1901 by George E. Davenport as &quot;Asplenium ebeneum&quot; var. &quot;hortonae&quot;. These specimens were found in 1900 growing on limestone in Brattleboro, Vermont by Frances B. Horton, for whom Davenport named the variety. In this variety, all the pinnae (including the more reduced basal pinnae) are obliquely toothed or cut very nearly into separate, toothed pinnules. The upright fronds are sterile. Willard Clute treated it as a form, &quot;A. ebeneum&quot; f. &quot;hortonae&quot;, in 1906. B. L. Robinson, in 1908, declared &quot;A. ebeneum&quot; var. &quot;hortonae&quot; a synonym of &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; var. &quot;incisum&quot;. Clute transferred the epithet at the varietal level to form &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; var. &quot;hortonae&quot; in 1909, but he also equated this with var. &quot;incisum&quot;. Lyman B. Smith continued to recognize it in Massachusetts, treating it as the form &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; f. &quot;hortonae&quot; in 1928. In 1937, Arthur Leeds explicitly distinguished it at varietal level, noting that a photograph of the type of &quot;A. ebeneum&quot; var. &quot;incisum&quot; did not closely correspond to &quot;A. ebeneum&quot; var. &quot;hortonae&quot;, having merely toothed rather than deeply cut and overlapping pinnae. Edgar Wherry also explicitly distinguished &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; var. &quot;hortonae&quot; from &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; var. &quot;incisum&quot;, erroneously duplicating Clute&#x27;s 1909 combination. Material collected from St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland was described by James E. Benedict, Jr. in 1947 as &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; f. &quot;dissectum&quot;, noting that while similar to f. &quot;hortonae&quot;, some of the pinnae in his material were completely cut into pinnules, which were themselves deeply lobed. Taylor &quot;et al.&quot; noted that much of Benedict&#x27;s material, however, resembled typical f. &quot;hortonae&quot;, although approaching var. &quot;bacculum-rubrum&quot; in size. They equated f. &quot;dissectum&quot; with f. &quot;hortonae&quot;, and noted that specimens of the latter could approach var. &quot;incisum&quot; and var. &quot;bacculum-rubrum&quot;. While Wagner and Johnson declined to distinguish most infraspecific taxa within &quot;A. platyneuron&quot;, they did recognize f. &quot;hortonae&quot; as a &quot;rare sterile form&quot;.

A form with forked fronds was known around the end of the nineteenth century, and was formally described in 1909 by Willard Clute as &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; f. &quot;furcatum&quot;. The form differs from normal &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; only in forking near the apex of the blade. Robert M. Tetrick II discovered similar plants in West Virginia, which he described as having &quot;fronds much branched, the ultimate divisions crested&quot; and named &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; f. &quot;multifidum&quot;. Taylor &quot;et al.&quot; compared the type of this form with Clute&#x27;s illustration of f. &quot;furcatum&quot; and considered them to be the same. Wagner &amp; Johnson noted that such forms were a frequent developmental error in many species of North American fern.

The formation of proliferating buds in ebony spleenwort has also given rise to a taxonomic distinction. Bud formation was first observed by the nurseryman Conrad Loddiges in 1817, in specimens in cultivation in Great Britain. However, the phenomenon was overlooked until 1879, when D. C. Eaton observed it in specimens from Florida. He took this for an aberrant variety, which he named &quot;A. ebeneum&quot; var. &quot;proliferum&quot;. Willard Clute reduced its status from a variety to a form, &quot;A. ebeneum&quot; f. &quot;proliferum&quot;, in 1906. Similar specimens were subsequently reported from Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut; the buds appeared on the rachis of sterile fronds, and were often only detected when mounting the specimen. In 1924, Frederick G. Floyd argued that the formation of these proliferations was a normal characteristic of the species, which appeared regularly, if not universally, and did not warrant a varietal designation. He also observed the formation of proliferating buds on a fertile rachis of &quot;A. ebeneum&quot; var. &quot;serratum&quot;. Floyd&#x27;s position was not universally accepted: Louise Tanger made a new combination for the form, &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; f. &quot;proliferum&quot; in 1933, and Taylor &quot;et al.&quot; recognized it in a discussion of infraspecific taxa in the species in 1976. However, these authors noted that specimens of &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; f. &quot;proliferum&quot; would be assigned to various other varieties if they were not proliferous. Wagner &amp; Johnson, in 1981, declined to recognize the taxon on grounds similar to Floyd&#x27;s, and Wagner&#x27;s treatment in &quot;Flora of North America&quot; does not mention the form.

===Hybrids===
As part of the &quot;Appalachian &quot;Asplenium&quot; complex&quot;, ebony spleenwort has been found to form hybrids with a number of other spleenworts. The hybrid with mountain spleenwort (&quot;A. montanum&quot;) has been collected only rarely, but on multiple occasions, this hybrid has undergone chromosome doubling to give rise to the fertile species known as Bradley&#x27;s spleenwort (&quot;A. bradleyi&quot;). A backcross between &quot;A. bradleyi&quot; and &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; is believed to have been collected twice, from a now-destroyed site in Pennsylvania, and in a preliminary report from Sequatchie County, Tennessee. The hybrid with walking fern (&quot;A. rhizophyllum&quot;), known as Scott&#x27;s spleenwort (&quot;A. × ebenoides&quot;), regularly appears where the two parent species grow together. At one locality, in Havana Glen, Alabama, &quot;A. × ebenoides&quot; has undergone chromosome doubling to produce a fertile species, Tutwiler&#x27;s spleenwort (&quot;A. tutwilerae&quot;). The backcross between &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; and &quot;A. tutwilerae&quot; is known as Boydston&#x27;s spleenwort (&quot;A. × boydstoniae&quot;), occurring in nature only with &quot;A. tutwilerae&quot; at Havana Glen. &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; is also known to hybridize with lobed spleenwort (&quot;A. pinnatifidum&quot;), a descendant of mountain spleenwort and walking fern, to produce the rare Kentucky spleenwort (&quot;A. × kentuckiense&quot;). Evidence for these hybridizations was obtained through cytological studies, chromatography, and allozyme electrophoresis.

Outside of the &quot;Appalachian &quot;Asplenium&quot; complex&quot;, &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; can also hybridize with wall-rue (&quot;A. ruta-muraria&quot;), forming Morgan&#x27;s spleenwort (&quot;A. × morganii), and with maidenhair spleenwort (&quot;A. trichomanes&quot;) to form Virginia spleenwort (&quot;A. × virginicum&quot;). &quot;A. × morganii&quot; is known from one specimen, collected from a limestone cliff overlooking the Potomac River in Maryland, while &quot;A. × virginicum&quot; has been collected three times, from Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina. A hybrid with Asian walking fern, &quot;A. ruprechtii&quot;, has been produced in cultivation and is informally known as &quot;A. × crucibuli&quot; in horticulture. It is similar to &quot;A. × ebenoides&quot;, but the frond is linear in shape, rather than being wider at the base.

==Distribution and habitat==
In North America, &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; is native throughout the eastern United States from southern Maine to the southeastern corner of Wisconsin, south to Florida and west to eastern Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, and in the far southeast of Canada. It is also found around the meeting point of Colorado, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, and in isolated small populations in New Mexico, Arizona and the West Indies. Outside of North America, &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; is found in tropical and subtropical southern Africa, a distribution not known for any other North American fern. It ranges from the Western Cape province of South Africa northwards along the eastern seaboard to Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces, its distribution including Lesotho. An isolated population was found on serpentine soil in an oak woodland in Slovakia in 2009. Since the 1960s, &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; has spread rapidly and aggressively in the Great Lakes region, where it was formerly uncommon. Though widespread in southern Africa, it is not particularly abundant, and in that part of its range is most commonly found in Lesotho.

&quot;Asplenium platyneuron&quot; can be found in a wide variety of habitats, at altitudes from . It will tolerate soils ranging from (pH 3.5–4.0) to subalkaline (pH 8.0–8.5), although it prefers subacid soils (pH 4.5–5.0) over . Unlike many other North American spleenworts, it can grow on soil as well as rock. When growing in soil, it can be found in forests and woodlands, including sandy pinelands, as well as old fields and other disturbed sites. It can colonize a variety of rocks, particularly (but not limited to) calcareous ones, and will also grow on mortared walls. In South Africa, it is generally found at altitudes over 600 meters (2,000 ft), in habitats similar to those it prefers in North America (under small bushes and on rocky banks). It typically occurs neither in full shade nor in full sun, but at the base of rocks in grasslands and at forest edges and in &quot;Leucosidea&quot; scrub.

==Ecology and conservation==
Protein extracts from &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; have been shown to deter insect predation on soybeans to a significant extent, and the Missouri Botanical Garden describes it as lacking &quot;serious insect or disease problems&quot;. However, a population of several hundred individuals in Florida was reported to have been almost wiped out by insect activity. It is susceptible to slugs. The black fern aphid (&quot;Idiopterus nephrelepidis&quot;) can feed on it.

Sporophytes are fairly tolerant of drought, but require well-drained soils. The prothallia (gametophytes) of &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; can survive periods of drought for up to a month. There is some evidence to show that the prothallia may undergo clonal reproduction and fission, which has been induced in the laboratory through variations in light intensity.

A variety of adaptations make &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; an aggressive colonizer, even weedy, when compared with other spleenworts, although a warming climate and an increase in second growth habitats may also have played a role in its expansion in the Great Lakes region. It tolerates broad variation in soil conditions, including pH, and will grow in both sun and shade. The starchy stipe bases provide energy for rapid growth in the spring, allowing the fronds to keep ahead of competing vegetation. The erect fertile fronds, unusual for &quot;Asplenium&quot;, help release spores into the wind for long-distance dispersal, while the proliferative buds allow clonal propagation in moist, fertile habitats. The species also carries a very low genetic load, so that viable sporophytes can develop from intragametophytic self-fertilization with 83–89% success. This means that new sporophytes can usually grow from the gametophyte formed from a single spore. This has allowed ebony spleenwort to be an early colonizer, from distant locations, of recently disturbed habitats, such as coal spoils in southern Iowa. The appearance of &quot;A. platyneuron&quot; in a disturbed habitat in Slovakia, from the nearest known sites in eastern North America, is probably the result of long-distance dispersal, which may also have allowed it to colonize and naturalize in South Africa.

While globally secure (G5), ebony spleenwort is considered an endangered species in some of the states and provinces at the northern and western edges of its North American range. NatureServe considers it to be critically imperiled (S1) in Arizona and Colorado, imperiled (S2) in Nebraska, Maine, Rhode Island, and Quebec, and vulnerable (S3) in Florida and Minnesota.

==Cultivation==
The ebony spleenwort is sometimes grown as a terrarium or garden plant. It can be cultivated in sandy peat, subacid garden soil, other gravelly, sandy or gritty soils, or potting mix under moist to dry conditions. Both acid and alkaline soils are acceptable. Good drainage is essential, and the species will grow even in dry soil. Partial sun or low to high light is recommended, although full shade is tolerated. Plants are said to be easy to maintain once they have become established, but it has been described as &quot;rather difficult&quot; to grow in Germany. Conrad Loddiges found it necessary to use artificial heat to cultivate ebony spleenwort in Great Britain.

<doc id="511686" wikidata="Q1631816" url="?curid=511686" title="Howard Kazanjian">
<text>Howard G. Kazanjian (born July 26, 1942) is an Armenian-American film producer best known for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, as well as the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; movie &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. Kazanjian was an originating member of Lucasfilm, Ltd., serving as its vice president for approximately eight years (1977 to 1984).

Howard Kazanjian is a published non-fiction author, with a focus on the factual Old West of US history. In 2021, Kazanjian also published his well-received 340-page memoir &quot;Howard Kazanjian: A Producer&#x27;s Life&quot;, edited and compiled by prolific Star Wars historian J.W. Rinzler.

==Early life==
Kazanjian was born in Los Angeles County, California, and is of Armenian descent. He graduated from the University of Southern California. While there he first met a young George Lucas, and they became not only Delta Kappa Alpha cinema fraternity brothers but also long standing friends. They were members of a clique of filmmakers known to the Hollywood system and the university circuit as The Dirty Dozen. During those college years, Kazanjian and Lucas both met their respective future wives, and the couples would often double date.

Kazanjian&#x27;s early credits include being First Assistant Director on Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Family Plot&quot; and Second Assistant Director on Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;. He later worked with director Robert Wise on his production of &quot;The Hindenburg&quot;. Kazanjian eventually moved into film production rather than directorial work. He later stated, &quot;The films offered to me I don&#x27;t want to direct. The films I want to direct are not offered.&quot;

==Lucasfilm==
As Lucasfilm&#x27;s Vice President of Production, Howard Kazanjian was intimately involved in the day-to-day strategic and practical operations of Lucasfilm during the times immediately after the 1977 release of &quot;Star Wars&quot; until approximately 1984 or 1985.

==&quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;==
Kazanjian is most notable for having served as executive producer on &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; and producer on &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. He is also recognized as an uncredited producer on &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, replacing producer Gary Kurtz midway through the production. For &quot;Jedi&quot; he came up with the idea of shooting the production under a fake name, &quot;Blue Harvest&quot;, in order to forestall any attempts at price gouging by suppliers. &quot;Blue Harvest&quot; was purported to be a horror film with the tag line &quot;horror beyond imagination&quot;. Hats and T-shirts were printed up for the crew to wear and to further add to the authenticity of the ruse.

During the casting of &quot;Raiders&quot;, Kazanjian heavily campaigned for Harrison Ford to be cast as Indiana Jones, to the point he almost lost his job over it. Jones was intended to be a smoker and a drinker, but Kazanjian convinced Lucas and Steven Spielberg to remove that. The scene where sunlight passing through the Headpiece to the Staff of Ra reveals the location of the Well of the Souls was proposed by Kazanjian, who was inspired by the golden statues of Ramesses II at the Abu Simbel temples in Egypt. The temple was positioned so that sunlight would penetrate the sanctuary and illuminate the statues once a year.

The issue of whether Ford would reprise his role of Han Solo for the third &quot;Star Wars&quot; film arose during pre-production. Kazanjian was responsible for getting him to return:
I played a very important part in bringing Harrison back for &quot;Return of the Jedi.&quot; Harrison, unlike Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill signed only a two picture contract. That is why he was frozen in carbonite in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. When I suggested to George we should bring him back, I distinctly remember him saying that Harrison would never return. I said what if I convinced him to return. George simply replied that we would then write him in to &quot;Jedi&quot;. I had just recently negotiated his deal for &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; with Phil Gersh of the Gersh Agency. I called Phil who said he would speak with Harrison. When I called back again, Phil was on vacation. David, his son, took the call and we negotiated Harrison&#x27;s deal. When Phil returned to the office several weeks later he called me back and said I had taken advantage of his son in the negotiations. I had not. But agents are agents.

The ending scene of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was originally only going to show the Force ghosts of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, but two days before the scene was shot, Kazanjian suggested that the ghost of Anakin Skywalker appear as well.

==Later years==
Kazanjian has authored books with Chris Enss. In 2004, they collaborated on &quot;The Cowboy and the Senorita: A Biography of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans&quot; and &quot;Happy Trails: A Pictorial Celebration of the Lives of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans&quot; ; In 2006, &quot;The Young Duke: The Early Life of John Wayne&quot; ; in 2009, &quot;Thunder over the Prairie: The True Story of a Murder and a Manhunt by the Greatest Posse of All Time&quot; .

He has been an instructor at &quot;Act One&quot;, a group designed to train Christians entering into film and television, and was named by Beliefnet as one of the twelve most powerful Christians in Hollywood.

Kazanjian is an active member of the Armenian charity and cultural community, and a USC alumnus.

Since 1998, Kazanjian has been co-chairman and 50% shareholder of Tricor Entertainment, Inc, an independent production company, which owns and operates a 19,000+ seat theater chain in Southeast Asia and a film distribution company.

In 2023, Kazanjian attended book signing events hosted by Armenian Film Society.

==Personal life==
Kazanjian lives and works in the community of San Marino, California with his wife Carol (née Eskijian), and three children, Peter, Noah, and Andrew.

Kazanjian and George Lucas remain close friends to this day.

<doc id="511688" wikidata="Q502191" url="?curid=511688" title="Manchester Phoenix">
<text>Manchester Phoenix was a semi professional ice hockey team from Greater Manchester, England. The club was formed in 2003 as a result of the efforts of supporters group &quot;Friends of Manchester Ice Hockey&quot; to bring top-level ice hockey back to Manchester after Manchester Storm folded in 2002.

The Phoenix team was a founder member of the Elite Ice Hockey League upon its formation in 2003, playing in the 17,500 capacity Manchester Arena. The cost of using such a large facility proved financially untenable, and Phoenix suspended playing operations in 2004 pending the construction of a smaller purpose built ice facility. Construction of the Altrincham Ice Dome commenced in 2006, and the club returned to the Elite League for the 2006–07 season. After three seasons in the EIHL, the club joined the English Premier Ice Hockey League on 30 April 2009.

During their time in EPIHL, the club was fairly successful, having won two league championships and one playoff final, with multiple appearances at the playoff finals weekend.

In 2015, the club was left without a home rink within Greater Manchester. They played their home games at Deeside Ice Arena in North Wales, Fylde Coast Ice Arena in Blackpool, and finally at Widnes Ice Arena.

The club folded on 31 January 2017 after an unsuccessful meeting with potential investors.

==History==

===Origins===

In 2002, the Manchester Storm, once the best-supported Ice Hockey club in Europe, ran into serious financial trouble and was folded. Initially fans protested against SMG, the company who owned the Manchester Evening News Arena as it was perceived that troubles had arisen due to SMG&#x27;s disinterest in continuing to house the Storm at the Manchester Evening News Arena. This soon turned into a rally in support of the team and a supporters group known as &#x27;The Friends of Manchester Storm&#x27; was established after Gary Cowan, the owner of the Storm officially announced he was finalising the organisation&#x27;s operations due to unsustainable debts. Once it became clear that the Storm were not to return, FOMS changed their name, becoming the &#x27;Friends of Manchester Ice Hockey&#x27;, or &#x27;FOMIH&#x27;.

This group had two established aims, namely to bring top level professional ice hockey back to Manchester and to ensure the creation of a new ice rink facility in the region. In 2003, a club was formed and with fans choosing to symbolically title the team the &#x27;Manchester Phoenix&#x27;, rising from the ashes of the Storm.

===Initial playing operations===

The newly formed Manchester Phoenix would be one of the founding members of the British Elite Ice Hockey League and played out of the MEN Arena for their inaugural season. Under player-coach Rick Brebant, and later Paul Heavey, the team finished sixth out of eight in the league, the final qualifying place for the playoffs. Phoenix finished second in their Playoff group ahead of the Belfast Giants, qualifying for the semi-final, where they were beaten 6–1 by the Nottingham Panthers.

Despite an impressive beginning, with 3,600 turning out for the first home game against the London Racers, crowds would not be consistent and it soon became apparent that ice hockey at the busiest indoor venue in Europe would no longer be viable with the season&#x27;s average attendance being just 2,150 per game, falling far short of the rumoured number of 3,000 needed to cover costs. As a result, the Phoenix temporarily suspended playing operations at the end of the 2003–04 season.

In May 2004 the Phoenix announced that they had the funding to construct a new temporary ice rink but problems arose as to exactly where to locate the facility. As a result, the deadline for inclusion in the EIHL passed, and the Phoenix withdrew from the 2004–05 season. The club had still not managed to build a new venue by the following year, and announced that the Phoenix would not be part of the 2005–06 season either. In November 2005, the club announced details of a new rink to be built in partnership with Nikal, David McLean and Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council. The new rink would seat 2,026, with 24 wheelchair spaces, and standing for approx 4–500. Planning permission for the rink was finally granted in early January 2006 and construction began on 30 March, with the rink to be sited in Altrincham.

With progress being made, the Phoenix confirmed their inclusion in the EIHL once again, for the 2006–07 season with the Ice Dome scheduled to host its first game on 24 September 2006. The Phoenix also announced the appointment of Tony Hand as player/head coach. This was regarded as a huge step forward for the organisation, as Hand is regarded by many as the greatest British ice hockey player of all time. Unfortunately for Hand and the team, unexpected delays followed and so in the interim Phoenix home games were held at either IceSheffield or Deeside Leisure Centre. After further construction and two further missed completion dates, the rink eventually opened with a reduced capacity of 1,000 on 25 February 2007, with Phoenix playing host to the Basingstoke Bison. It was the first time professional hockey had been played in Manchester for almost three years. The remaining 700 seats were installed over the following months, with the Dome completely ready for the beginning of the 2007–08 season.

For further information, please see 2006–07 Manchester Phoenix season.

===Demise===
On the weekend of the 2015 playoff finals, it was announced by Silver Blades that they were unable to reach agreement with the Club to renew the ice time agreement despite an offer of reduced rental costs. Further details were given on the 8th April. Manchester Phoenix issued a statement refuting the allegations made of unpaid rental costs.

As a result of this, the club left themselves homeless, but with plans to build a new arena in Manchester City Centre. While this was being prepared however, it was announced that the club would play in Deeside for the 2015-2016 season.

In June 2016, it was announced that Manchester Phoenix would move to Eastlands for the 2016/2017 season. However unrealistic time scales and planning delays meant that this rink was not able to be started in time for the season. Instead, the club chose to play from the Fylde Ice Arena, Blackpool.

Again the proposed timescales proved unachievable and, the new rink was not able to be even started in time for January 2017, making the business model of playing from Blackpool unviable. As a result, the club was forced to release its imported playing staff and move to Silver Blades Widnes. This added pressure, and the unlikely prospect of the club being able to fund a permanent home in Manchester, meant that the club was forced to fold halfway through the 2016/17 season.

===Earlier seasons===

====2007–08 season====
Form continued to be hard to find for the Phoenix though. Despite scoring significant numbers of goals, the Phoenix defence proved to be anything but watertight and high scoring games became a regular occurrence. Manchester closed the regular season on 23 April with a 6–2 away loss to the Hull Stingrays, finishing 7th in the EIHL. This was perceived by many fans to be somewhat of an underachievement by the organisation.

The Phoenix&#x27;s seventh-placed finish ensured a post-season matchup with their fiercest rivals, the Sheffield Steelers. Again two high scoring games would follow; the Phoenix lost 5–4 in Sheffield, ensuring a tense return leg at the Ice Dome. Despite scoring four goals, the Phoenix defence again proved to be a problem, with the game ending 4–4 in front of a sell out crowd of 2150. The draw meant that the Phoenix exited the playoffs in the first round for the second year in a row.

====2008–09 season====
For a game-by-game log, see 2008–09 Manchester Phoenix Season

====2009–10 season====
The team finished the season in 3rd place, and qualified for the EPL post season play-offs. They defeated the Peterborough Phantons 6–5 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to progress to the finals weekend in Coventry, where they were defeated in their semi final by the Slough Jets.

====2010–11 season====
On 27 March 2011, Manchester Phoenix played Swindon Wildcats at home on the last day of the season. Going into the game, Manchester Phoenix needed a single point to secure the league title. They beat Swindon 5–2 picking up two points and therefore were crowned league champions, earning the club&#x27;s first major trophy.

====2011–12 season====
Despite losing player/coach Tony Hand to a serious injury, the club managed to remain competitive and finished a creditable 2nd in the league. The Club subsequently qualified for the play off finals weekend, where they defeated local rivals the Sheffield Steeldogs in the semi-final, before losing to the Slough Jets in the final game

====2012–13 season====
The Phoenix finished the season 3rd in the league, and also reached the Cup semi finals, losing to Guildford Flames. However, in the end of season play off finals, the club took their revenge beating Guildford 5–2 and emerged victorious, claiming their first play off title in the process.

====2013–14 season====
On 16 March 2014 Manchester Phoenix won their second league title after beating close rivals Basingstoke Bison 5–2. The Phoenix had been in contention for the title throughout the season, but only clinched the title with 1 round of fixtures remaining. The club proceeded to qualify for the Play Off Finals weekend, where they were unable to defend their Play Off title, finishing as runner up.

====2014–15 season====
On 3 April 2015, the eve of the 2015 playoff finals weekend, it was announced that Red Hockey UK purchased 34% of the Phoenix&#x27;s shares, Red Hockey UK already owned the Bracknell Bees (49% of shares) and Telford Tigers (100%). The owners announced that they would be leaving Altrincham, moving the club to a new rink in central Manchester.

It was also during this weekend that Silver Blades made the announcement that their proposal concerning the renewal of the ice time agreement could not be agreed with the club despite the offer of reduced rental costs, which left the club playing all their &quot;home&quot; games in Deeside, North Wales, Blackpool, and Widnes during the following 2 seasons.

==Statistics==

==Attendance==

The club attracted a significantly lower set of attendance figures than the Manchester Storm did. During the team&#x27;s first season, the average attendance for all home league fixtures was given as 2,267, in a 17,245-seat arena (although only 4,500 of the lower bowl seats were made available for public use during games. This comprised the seating blocks along the sides of the ice, with those behind the goals being inaccessible). When the move to Altrincham was completed, the attendance averaged 800, climbing to 1,027 in the 09–10 season. This made the club the third-best attended club in the EPIHL, behind the Guildford Flames and Milton Keynes Lightning, and the ninth overall in Great Britain.

<doc id="511691" wikidata="Q1194115" url="?curid=511691" title="Isosceles trapezoid">
<text>In Euclidean geometry, an isosceles trapezoid (isosceles trapezium in British English) is a convex quadrilateral with a line of symmetry bisecting one pair of opposite sides. It is a special case of a trapezoid. Alternatively, it can be defined as a trapezoid in which both legs and both base angles are of equal measure, or as a trapezoid whose diagonals have equal length. Note that a non-rectangular parallelogram is not an isosceles trapezoid because of the second condition, or because it has no line of symmetry. In any isosceles trapezoid, two opposite sides (the bases) are parallel, and the two other sides (the legs) are of equal length (properties shared with the parallelogram), and the diagonals have equal length. The base angles of an isosceles trapezoid are equal in measure (there are in fact two pairs of equal base angles, where one base angle is the supplementary angle of a base angle at the other base).

==Special cases==

Rectangles and squares are usually considered to be special cases of isosceles trapezoids though some sources would exclude them.

Another special case is a &quot;3-equal side trapezoid&quot;, sometimes known as a &quot;trilateral trapezoid&quot; or a &quot;trisosceles trapezoid&quot;. They can also be seen dissected from regular polygons of 5 sides or more as a truncation of 4 sequential vertices.

=== Self-intersections===
Any non-self-crossing quadrilateral with exactly one axis of symmetry must be either an isosceles trapezoid or a kite. However, if crossings are allowed, the set of symmetric quadrilaterals must be expanded to include also the crossed isosceles trapezoids, crossed quadrilaterals in which the crossed sides are of equal length and the other sides are parallel, and the antiparallelograms, crossed quadrilaterals in which opposite sides have equal length.

Every antiparallelogram has an isosceles trapezoid as its convex hull, and may be formed from the diagonals and non-parallel sides (or either pair of opposite sides in the case of a rectangle) of an isosceles trapezoid.

==Characterizations==
If a quadrilateral is known to be a trapezoid, it is &quot;not&quot; sufficient just to check that the legs have the same length in order to know that it is an isosceles trapezoid, since a rhombus is a special case of a trapezoid with legs of equal length, but is not an isosceles trapezoid as it lacks a line of symmetry through the midpoints of opposite sides.

Any one of the following properties distinguishes an isosceles trapezoid from other trapezoids:
*The diagonals have the same length.
*The base angles have the same measure.
*The segment that joins the midpoints of the parallel sides is perpendicular to them.
*Opposite angles are supplementary, which in turn implies that isosceles trapezoids are cyclic quadrilaterals.
*The diagonals divide each other into segments with lengths that are pairwise equal; in terms of the picture below, , (and if one wishes to exclude rectangles).
==Angles==
In an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles have the same measure pairwise. In the picture below, angles ∠&quot;ABC&quot; and ∠&quot;DCB&quot; are obtuse angles of the same measure, while angles ∠&quot;BAD&quot; and ∠&quot;CDA&quot; are acute angles, also of the same measure.

Since the lines &quot;AD&quot; and &quot;BC&quot; are parallel, angles adjacent to opposite bases are supplementary, that is, angles 

==Diagonals and height==

The diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid have the same length; that is, every isosceles trapezoid is an equidiagonal quadrilateral. Moreover, the diagonals divide each other in the same proportions. As pictured, the diagonals &quot;AC&quot; and &quot;BD&quot; have the same length () and divide each other into segments of the same length ( and ).

The ratio in which each diagonal is divided is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the parallel sides that they intersect, that is,
:formula_1

The length of each diagonal is, according to Ptolemy&#x27;s theorem, given by
:formula_2

where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are the lengths of the parallel sides &quot;AD&quot; and &quot;BC&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; is the length of each leg &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;CD&quot;.

The height is, according to the Pythagorean theorem, given by
:formula_3

The distance from point &quot;E&quot; to base &quot;AD&quot; is given by
:formula_4
where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are the lengths of the parallel sides &quot;AD&quot; and &quot;BC&quot;, and &quot;h&quot; is the height of the trapezoid.

==Area==
The area of an isosceles (or any) trapezoid is equal to the average of the lengths of the base and top (&quot;the parallel sides&quot;) times the height. In the adjacent diagram, if we write , and , and the height &quot;h&quot; is the length of a line segment between &quot;AD&quot; and &quot;BC&quot; that is perpendicular to them, then the area &quot;K&quot; is

:formula_5

If instead of the height of the trapezoid, the common length of the legs &quot;AB&quot; =&quot;CD&quot; = &quot;c&quot; is known, then the area can be computed using Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral, which with two sides equal simplifies to

:formula_6

where formula_7 is the semi-perimeter of the trapezoid. This formula is analogous to Heron&#x27;s formula to compute the area of a triangle. The previous formula for area can also be written as

:formula_8

==Circumradius==
The radius in the circumscribed circle is given by
:formula_9

In a rectangle where &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot; this is simplified to formula_10.

<doc id="511692" wikidata="Q1442405" url="?curid=511692" title="Manchester Storm (1995–2002)">
<text>The Manchester Storm were an ice hockey team from Manchester, England. The team formed in 1995, playing their home games at the then newly built NYNEX Arena, but they folded during the 2002–03 season.

==Early success==

Storm won the British Hockey League Division One in their first season, watched by an average crowd of 6,342. Success in the end of season promotion/relegation play-offs followed, resulting in Storm being promoted to the Premier Division of the British Hockey League. However, Britain&#x27;s league structure was changed in 1996, with the formation of the Ice Hockey Superleague, of which the Manchester team were a founder member. This was alongside Ayr Scottish Eagles, Basingstoke Bison, Bracknell Bees, Cardiff Devils, Newcastle Riverkings, Nottingham Panthers and Sheffield Steelers. The highs of the inaugural season weren&#x27;t matched in season 2 though, and Storm finished a disappointing seventh in the league. This led to the sacking of coach John Lawless.

American Kurt Kleinendorst was brought in for the 1997–98 season and he completely changed the face of the playing staff. There were 12 new faces on the 19 strong roster when the season started and they went on to make history for a British club in the European Hockey League. As well as holding Dynamo Moscow to a regulation time draw (losing 2–3 in overtime), they beat Sparta Prague home and away – winning 7–0 at home and 4–3 in the Czech capital.

Storm hold the record for the largest ice hockey attendance at a UK league game, set on 23 February 1997, when 17,245 people watched a match against Sheffield Steelers. At the time, this was also a European record. The record for the largest attendance at any ice hockey game in the UK is 17,551 at The O2 arena (London) on 30 September 2007 for an NHL game between the Los Angeles Kings and the Anaheim Ducks.

==The end of an era==

Manchester Storm folded in 2002 during the 2002–03 season when the costs of running the team out of the Manchester Arena, and at the top level of British hockey, could not be supported by ticket revenue and sponsorship. The then owners SMG who also ran the arena sold the team to Manchester businessman in full knowledge they did not want ice hockey in the arena then following Sky TVs pulling out of its contract to show live games this meant sponsors pulled out, with no live games and no sponsors and an Arena who didn&#x27;t want ice hockey in the building owner Gary Cowan had no option other than to put the team into receivership. Later on during the same season Ayr Scottish Eagles also folded.

A supporters group was formed following the collapse of Manchester Storm and launched a new team called the Manchester Phoenix the following season.

==Return of the Storm==

In June 2015, following the departure of the Manchester Phoenix from the Altrincham Ice Dome due to a dispute with the current owners, it was announced a new team would be based at the rink using the Manchester Storm name. The newly formed Storm would replace the folded Hull Stingrays in the EIHL from the start of the 2015–16 season.

<text>Controversy over George W. Bush&#x27;s military service in the Air National Guard was an issue that first gained widespread public attention during the 2004 presidential campaign. The controversy centered on Bush&#x27;s service in the Texas Air National Guard, why he lost his flight status, and whether he fulfilled the requirements of his military service contract.

==Timeline==
George W. Bush joined the 147th Fighter-Interceptor Group of the Texas Air National Guard on May 27, 1968, during the Vietnam War. He committed to serve until May 26, 1974, with two years on active duty while training to fly and four years on part-time duty. In his 1968 Statement of Intent (undated), he wrote, &quot;I have applied for pilot training to make flying a lifetime pursuit, and I believe I can best accomplish this to my satisfaction by serving as a member of the Air National Guard as long as possible.&quot;

Bush was quoted as saying elsewhere &quot;I was not prepared to shoot my eardrum out with a shotgun to get a deferment. Nor was I willing to go to Canada&quot;. In his autobiography Bush states that he was willing to serve his country but preferred to do so as a combat pilot rather than &quot;An infantryman wading across a paddy-field&quot;. 

Following his six weeks of basic training, Bush began 54 weeks of flight training at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia. In December 1969, Bush began twenty-one weeks of fighter-interceptor training on the F-102 in Houston at the 147th&#x27;s Combat Crew Training School, soloing in March 1970 and graduating in June 1970. When he graduated, he had fulfilled his two-year active-duty commitment.

In November 1970, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian, commander of the 111th Fighter Squadron, recommended that Bush be promoted to first lieutenant, calling him &quot;a dynamic outstanding young officer&quot; who stood out as &quot;a top-notch fighter interceptor pilot.&quot; He said that &quot;Lt. Bush&#x27;s skills far exceed his contemporaries,&quot; and that &quot;he is a natural leader whom his contemporaries look to for leadership. Lt. Bush is also a good follower with outstanding disciplinary traits and an impeccable military bearing.&quot; Bush was promoted.

Air National Guard members could volunteer for active duty service with the Air Force in a program called Palace Alert. The program deployed F-102 pilots to Europe and Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Thailand. Six Air National Guard squadrons were deployed to Korea and Vietnam during 1968. According to three pilots from Bush&#x27;s squadron, Bush inquired about this program but was advised by the base commander that he did not have the necessary flying experience (500 hours) at the time and that the F-102 would soon be retired, all aircraft of the type withdrawn from Vietnam by the end of 1968.

Bush&#x27;s four-year part-time obligation to serve required him to maintain his immediate readiness to be recalled to active duty in the event of a national emergency. Bush performed part-time Guard duty as an F-102 pilot through April 1972, logging a total of 336 flight hours.

Before April 1972, Bush had fulfilled more than the required hours of service, but with more than two years remaining before his discharge. He volunteered his services on several projects, including a political campaign. After April 1972, Bush may have failed to meet the attendance requirements established for members of the Air National Guard. In mid-1972, he failed to meet the Air Force requirement for an annual physical examination for pilots and lost his authorization to be a pilot. According to Bush&#x27;s pay records, he did not attend any drills between mid-April and the end of October 1972. He drilled in Alabama in October and November 1972, and again in January 1973; what duties he performed are unknown. Bush returned to his home unit in Houston and was paid for his service in April 1973 through July 1973; again, what duties he performed are not documented in any way.

On October 1, 1973, Bush was honorably discharged from the Texas Air National Guard and transferred to the Air Force Reserve&#x27;s inactive reserves in Denver, Colorado. He was discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21, 1974, ending his military service.

==Acceptance into the Air National Guard==

During the 1968–1974 period, Presidents Johnson and Nixon decided against calling up National Guard units for service in Vietnam. However, military documents show during the Vietnam War, almost 23,000 Army and Air Guardsmen were called up for a year of active duty; some 8,700 were deployed to Vietnam.

In 1999, Ben Barnes, former Democratic Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives and Lieutenant Governor of Texas, gave testimony in a deposition for a lawsuit related to the Texas lottery; and following the deposition, his lawyer issued a statement to the press. According to the statement, Barnes had called the head of the Texas Air National Guard, Brigadier General James Rose, to recommend Bush for a pilot spot at the request of Bush family friend Sidney Adger. The statement also said, &quot;Neither Congressman Bush nor any other member of the Bush family asked Barnes&#x27; help. Barnes has no knowledge that Governor Bush or President Bush knew of Barnes&#x27; recommendation.&quot; While working as an active fundraiser for John Kerry, Bush&#x27;s opponent during the 2004 U.S. Presidential campaign, Barnes repeated that he used his political influence to preferentially refer people to the National Guard, including Bush.

Both George W. Bush and his father have stated that they did not ask Adger to intercede and were unaware of any action he may have taken. Walter Staudt, the colonel in command of Bush&#x27;s squadron, has stated that he accepted Bush&#x27;s application without receiving any outside pressure to do so.

In applying for pilot training, Bush took a standardized test on which he had a low score, in the 25th percentile. Also, Bush had two arrests for college pranks and four traffic offenses before applying for pilot training. In 2004, former and current military pilots said it was uncommon for an applicant to be accepted into pilot&#x27;s school with such a record, though there was no specific score that disqualified a candidate.

==Flight performance and flight status in 1972 and 1973==

===Final flights===
Flight logs released in September 2004 in response to a lawsuit (see below) showed that Bush, who had been flying in the F-102A Delta Dagger, a single-seater interceptor, for most of his career, flew nine times in T-33 trainers in February and March 1972 – nearly twice as many times as he had flown in T-33s in the prior 18 months. The logs also show that on March 12 and April 10 of 1972, Bush took two passes to land his F-102 fighter. Although White House officials could not explain the changes in the flight logs in these final flights, Air Force experts said there could be any of a number of reasons for the change in Bush&#x27;s flight pattern. Retired Major General Paul A. Weaver, a former head of the Air National Guard, said Bush could have just been practicing landing skills. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t mean anything to have multiple approaches,&quot; Weaver said.

The final two entries of Bush&#x27;s official flight logs show him being assigned to work as an instructional pilot in late May 1972 at a Texas Air National Guard base. The entries were entered even though he had left for Alabama in mid-May (see below) and his pay records show nonpayment for any work on the two dates of the instructional pilot assignment. Coding on the logs showed these assignments were subsequently deleted from the official record.

===Flight physical===
By regulation, all Air Force pilots were required to take and pass an annual physical in order to remain in flight status, in the three months prior to a pilot&#x27;s birthday (in Bush&#x27;s case, July 6). Bush did not take this mandatory physical examination in mid-1972. As a result of his failure to take his physical, his flight status was suspended by his commander on August 1, 1972, confirmed by Colonel Bobby Hodges on September 5, 1972, and confirmed again by a National Guard Bureau order on September 29, 1972, which meant he no longer was authorized to fly as a pilot.

Air National Guard regulations require that &quot;the local commander who has authority to convene a Flying Evaluation Board will direct an investigation as to why the individual failed to accomplish the medical examination.&quot; But there are no records of an investigation or of any requests to complete one.

Although flight surgeons did the previous two physicals that Bush had taken, Bush said in 2000 that he wanted to wait to take the examination until his private doctor could do it. But regulations required the physical to be performed by an Air Force doctor. Air Force flight surgeons were assigned to Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama, located across town from Maxwell AFB at the Dannelly Field Air National Guard Base at Dannelly Field airport, where Bush was paid for drilling in October and November 1972 and in January 1973, his only drilling dates between April 1972 and April 1973.

According to his released military records, after April 1972 Bush never flew again as an Air National Guard pilot.

==Drill attendance in 1972 and 1973==
During 2004, Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe and others accused Bush of being absent without leave (AWOL) from the Air National Guard in 1972–73. White House communications director Dan Bartlett and others, who called the charge election-year propaganda, noted that Bush was honorably discharged and that no AWOL charge had ever been made against Bush by the National Guard.

Released military records show that Bush&#x27;s documented service record through mid-April 1972 (Bush drilled on the 15th and 16th of that month) was without gaps; the period in question is from May 1972 forward.

===Transfer request===
On May 24, 1972, Bush submitted a form requesting a transfer to the 9921st Air Reserve Squadron in Montgomery, Alabama, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Reese R. Bricken. According to the request form, Bush was already in Alabama at work on the Senate campaign of Winton M. Blount, who was a friend of his father. Jimmy Allison, a longtime family friend, helped Bush get the campaign work.

On May 26, Bricken approved Bush&#x27;s application for transfer. Bricken wrote: &quot;You already understand that this is a Training Category G, Pay Group None, Reserve Section MM proposition.&quot; As an obligated Reservist, Bush was in Training Category &quot;fA&quot;, which required a minimum of 48 periods of inactive duty training, and 15 days of active duty training, and was required to remain in that Training Category. Training Category &quot;G&quot; offered no training at all. According to Air Force regulations (AFM 35-3, paragraph 14-6), being in &quot;Training Category A&quot; meant that &quot;If a member...will be unable to further train with his unit because of an impending change of residence...he is required to sign a statement that he has been counseled.&quot; That counseling included notifying Bush of his obligation to find a new unit with which he could fulfill his training obligations.

On July 31, the Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC) rejected Bush&#x27;s transfer request, saying that he could not be reassigned to an Air Reserve Squadron because of his obligated service. Bricken, asked about the matter in 2000, said that Bush made no effort to participate as a Guardsman with the 9921st.

===Equivalent duty in Alabama ===
Bush remained obligated to train with his Texas unit or to perform substitute training elsewhere each month. On September 5, 1972, he requested permission to &quot;perform equivalent duty&quot; at the 187th Tactical Reconnaissance Group in Alabama &quot;for the months of September, October, and November.&quot; He did not receive approval to do so, though his commanding officer recommended he be granted permission. He would have reported to Lieutenant Colonel William Turnipseed, the base commander, for drills on October 7 and 8, and November 4 and 5 (the September drill dates of the unit had already passed). Bush&#x27;s grandfather, former U.S. Senator Prescott Bush, died of cancer on October 8, and Bush served as a pallbearer at the funeral in Greenwich, Connecticut. Turnipseed has said that he could not recall whether Bush reported on those occasions.

In 2004, John &quot;Bill&quot; Calhoun, a former Alabama Air National Guard officer who had served at the Dannelly Field Air National Guard Base said he had seen Bush report for duty &quot;at least six times.&quot; He stated this happened in the spring and summer of 1972, a period Bush had not even applied for, and that Bush had spent time in his office. However, the payment and retirement records the White House handed out three days prior to Calhoun&#x27;s claims show that Bush received no pay or attendance credits during that May to October period.

The U.S. Senate campaign in Alabama, on which Bush worked, ended on November 7, 1972, when Blount lost overwhelmingly. Released military records show that Bush was paid for service for the days of October 28–29 and November 11–14, 1973, and for January 4–6 and 8–10, 1973, and that he received a dental examination at Dannelly on January 6. All of those dates are outside of the period that was claimed for Bush&#x27;s service in Alabama. 

A 2006 column in the &quot;Birmingham News&quot; (Alabama) reported about people who remembered Bush when he was in Alabama, working for the Blount campaign: &quot;None have specific recollections about Bush and the National Guard. Some heard he was serving but never saw for themselves.&quot; Opinions of him during his time working on the campaign ranged from good (amiable, well-liked, and fond of sports) to bad (bragging about drinking and allegations he trashed a cottage where he was living). Winton Blount&#x27;s son Tom said &quot;He was an attractive person, kind of a &#x27;frat boy.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t like him.&quot;

In 1972 and 1973, Bush dated Mavanee Bear, another member of Blount&#x27;s campaign staff. Bear said in 2009 that &quot;I know [Bush] served&quot; while in Alabama because he had to reschedule meetings regularly, but also said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t see him in uniform.&quot; When later back in Texas, she said she frequently saw him in uniform, stating &quot;I think he was mostly just flying in circles over Houston.&quot;

In a document dated May 2, 1973, Bush&#x27;s immediate superiors gave him his annual performance review for the period from May 1, 1972, to April 30, 1973. The review stated that &quot;Lt. Bush has not been observed at this unit during the period of the report.&quot; Lt. Col. William D. Harris Jr. and Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian also wrote, &quot;A civilian occupation made it necessary for him to move to Montgomery, Ala. He cleared this base on May 15, 1972, and has been performing equivalent training in a non-flying status with the 187 Tac Recon Gp. Dannelly ANG Base, Alabama.&quot;

=== Return to Houston ===
Back in Houston, in late 1972 or early 1973, Bush did unpaid volunteer work for a number of months with an inner-city poverty program, Project P.U.L.L. (Professional United Leadership League), the brainchild of John White, a former professional football player and civic leader.

Bush was paid for drilling on April 7–8, 1973. That service presumably occurred at his home base, Ellington Air Force Base, in Houston, in contradiction to the information in his performance review. For May 1973, Bush was paid for service on fifteen days: 1–3, 8–11, 19–20, 22–24, and 29-31. For June, he was paid for five days; for July (his last month of drilling) for 19 days. However, there is nothing in the released military documents that shows that he actually reported for duty on those days, or exactly where, or what duties he performed. As of the end of July 1973, Bush had been in the Air National Guard for a little over five years.

==Six-year service obligation==
On May 27, 1968, Bush signed a six-year obligation. That required him to complete &quot;48 scheduled inactive-duty training periods&quot; each fiscal year (typically consisting of four four-hour periods during one weekend each month), plus a minimum of 15 days of Annual Active Duty Training. For Bush, as a pilot, this was typically split into periods of duty of a few days each during the year.

The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reported in September 2004 that &quot;Bush fell well short of meeting his military obligation.&quot; They cite examples of Bush failing to meet Air National Guard commitments in 1972 and 1973. Bush&#x27;s military records show that he was credited for attending Air National Guard drills during 1972 and 1973, but the time frame of these drills (see above) still left questions.

On July 30, 1973, his last day of paid service in the Texas Air National Guard, Bush signed a statement that &quot;I have been counseled this date regarding my plans to leave my present Reserve of [sic] assignment due to moving from this area. I understand that: a. If I disassociate from my current Ready Reserve Assignment, it is my responsibility to locate and be assigned to another Reserve Forces unit or mobilization augmentation position. If I fail to do so, I am subject to involuntary order to active duty for up to 24 months under the provisions of AFM 35-3, chapter 14.&quot;

On September 5, 1973, Bush requested discharge from Texas Air National Guard service, to be effective on October 1. He wrote, &quot;I am moving to Boston, Massachusetts to attend Harvard Business School as a full-time student.&quot; Jerry Killian recommended approval of the discharge the following day. Bush had completed five years, four months, and five days toward his six-year service obligation.

On October 1, 1973, Bush was honorably discharged from the Texas Air National Guard and transferred to the Air Force Reserve&#x27;s inactive reserves in Denver, Colorado. On November 21, 1974, he was discharged from the Air Force Reserve, ending his military service.

In September 2004, Lawrence Korb, an Assistant Secretary of Defense under President Ronald Reagan, after reviewing the payroll records for Bush&#x27;s last two years of service, concluded that they indicated that Bush did not fulfill his obligations and could have been ordered to active duty as a result.

==Release of military records==
During the 2000 presidential campaign, various military records of Bush were made public by the Bush campaign.

On February 13, 2004, during Bush&#x27;s re-election campaign, more than 700 additional pages of documents on Bush&#x27;s service were released, including those from the National Personnel Records Center, under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. This release was claimed by some to contradict the statement that Bush made on February 8, 2004 to &quot;Meet the Press&quot; interviewer Tim Russert, that &quot;We did [authorize the release of everything] in 2000, by the way.&quot; In response, Bush contended that he was referring only to documents already in his possession, as opposed to the newly released documents from military sources.

On June 22, 2004, The Associated Press sued the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Air Force, seeking access to all of Bush&#x27;s records during his military service.

On July 8, 2004, the Pentagon reported that the microfilmed payroll records of Bush and numerous other service members had been inadvertently ruined in 1996 and 1997 by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service during a project to salvage deteriorating microfilm. The records lost included those covering July through September 1972, when Bush&#x27;s claims of service in Alabama were in question, and the Pentagon reported that no paper backups were found.

On July 23, 2004, the Pentagon reported that the records it had previously reported destroyed had been found. A Pentagon official said the earlier statement that the records were destroyed was an &quot;inadvertent oversight.&quot; The Pentagon released computerized payroll records covering Bush&#x27;s 1972 service. Like the records released earlier by the White House, the newly released documents did not indicate that Bush performed any drills, in Alabama or elsewhere, during May through September 1972.

On September 7, 2004, the White House released the flight logs recording the flights done by Bush as a pilot. A Pentagon spokeswoman said the logs were found at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, which is the central repository for veterans&#x27; records. She said the logs were found among a batch of records sent to St. Louis from Norton Air Force Base in 1993, which were originally thought to contain records of active-duty officers rather than of National Guardsmen such as Bush.

On September 24, 2004, under court order resulting from an earlier FOIA lawsuit filed by the Associated Press, the Pentagon released more documents.

On September 29, 2004, the White House released a November 1974 document, saying it had been in Bush&#x27;s personnel file and that the Pentagon had found it.

On October 5, 2004, more than a week after a court-imposed deadline to turn over all records of Bush&#x27;s military service, the Texas Air National Guard produced two previously unreleased documents (four pages of records) that included Bush&#x27;s orders for his last day of active duty in 1973.

On October 14, 2004, two weeks after Texas National Guard officials signed an oath swearing they had turned over all records, the Texas National Guard released 31 additional pages of documents found by two retired Army lawyers who went through Guard files under an agreement between the Texas National Guard and The Associated Press, which sued to gain access to the files. A Guard spokesman defended the continuing discoveries, saying Guard officials did not find all of Bush&#x27;s records because they were disorganized and in poor shape. &quot;These boxes are full of dirt and rat [excrement] and dead bugs. They have never been sitting in an uncontrolled climate,&quot; said Lt. Col. John Stanford. &quot;It&#x27;s a tough task to go through archives that were not set up in a way that you could easily go through them.&quot;

==Memos allegedly from Jerry Killian==

The &quot;Killian documents&quot; were initially claimed by CBS to have come from the &quot;personal files&quot; of the late Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian, Bush&#x27;s squadron commander during Bush&#x27;s Air National Guard service. They describe preferential treatment during Bush&#x27;s service, including pressure on Killian to &quot;sugar coat&quot; an annual officer rating report for the then 1st Lt. Bush. CBS aired the story on September 8, 2004, amid more releases of Bush&#x27;s official records by the Department of Defense, including one just the day before as the result of a FOIA lawsuit by the Associated Press.

The Killian documents were forgeries, according to The New York Times Starting with a Free Republic web posting by Harry MacDougald, a conservative Republican lawyer posting under the blogger name &quot;Buckhead.&quot; MacDougald and multiple fellow bloggers claimed that the formatting shown in the documents used proportional fonts that did not come into common use until desktop word processors became common, long after the purported memos were dated and were therefore forgeries. Experts have concluded that the documents are beyond all reasonable doubt, fakes. For instance, it is unlikely that the typewriters available to Killian&#x27;s secretary could have produced such a document, and the documents contained U.S. Army, rather than U.S. Air Force, jargon.

The forgery allegations subsequently came to the attention of the mainstream media, especially after experts also questioned the documents&#x27; authenticity and lack of a chain of custody. The original documents have never been submitted for authentication. The man who delivered the copies, Lt. Col. Bill Burkett, a former officer in the Texas Army National Guard and outspoken Bush critic, claimed that he burned the originals. Burkett admitted lying to CBS and &quot;USA Today&quot; about where he had obtained the papers and eventually expressed doubts of his own about their authenticity.

CBS and Dan Rather initially defended the documents and the report, but on September 20, 2004 – less than two months before Election Day, CBS News stated that it had been &quot;misled&quot; and that it could not authenticate the documents and should not have used them. A later &quot;60 Minutes&quot; broadcast an interview with Marian Carr Knox, secretary to Killian at the time, who stated that she &quot;didn&#x27;t type these memos&quot;, although she stated she had typed memos of similar content. CBS then formed an independent panel headed by former U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and retired Associated Press president Louis D. Boccardi to investigate the story and the handling of the Killian memos. The final report of the panel, while not addressing the authenticity of the documents, faulted many of the decisions made in developing the story, and producer Mary Mapes along with three others were forced to resign from CBS News.

Prior to the panel report being completed, Rather announced the date of his retirement, left &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot;, stepped down as anchor on March 9, 2006, and then left CBS altogether on June 20, 2006. The CBS news show that had aired the memos, &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot;, was canceled on May 18, 2005, allegedly due to poor ratings and not because of the memos broadcast.

In September 2007, Rather sued CBS and its former parent company, Viacom, for US$70 million, claiming that he had been made a &quot;scapegoat&quot; over the memos story. His legal fight with CBS ended in January 2010 when the New York State Supreme Court declined to hear his motion to reinstate his lawsuit.

<doc id="511696" wikidata="Q6238995" url="?curid=511696" title="John Henry Williams (baseball)">
<text>John Henry Dussault Williams (August 27, 1968 – March 6, 2004) was the only son of baseball player Ted Williams. His mother was Ted&#x27;s third wife, Dolores Wettach.

== Background ==
Williams was born in August 1968 in Brattleboro, Vermont. His father named him &quot;John-Henry&quot; after the folk hero of the same name and his mother chose the middle name &quot;Dussault&quot; after Ding Dussault, a friend of the family and athletics coach at Tufts University.

Williams saw little of his father after his parents divorced in 1972. He attended Ted Williams baseball camp and would see his father at camp once a week during the summer. By all accounts, the relationship between Ted and Dolores remained chilly as their children grew. Dolores raised John Henry and his sister Claudia on a farm near Putney, Vermont.

He attended Vermont Academy, a small private college preparatory high school in Saxtons River, and graduated in 1986. He spent three semesters at Bates College before transferring to the University of Maine and earning a B.S. in marketing in 1991.

== Business ==
In 1992, during the height of the sports card boom, John Henry, along with Grand Slam Marketing, founded a sports card company called the Ted Williams Card Company. The company issued two baseball and one football set (all three composed of retired players) over the next three years before it folded in 1995.

In 1999, he ran an internet service provider under the name hitter.net (formally known as Hitter Communications) that offered &quot;nationwide&quot; dial-up Internet access. The &quot;nationwide&quot; dial up service was offered as a white label product of AT&amp;T with local dialup being provided by equipment at the Hitter.Net offices in Hernando, Florida. The company was considered to be one of the largest ISPs within the Tampa Bay area. Hitter.Net was assigned a dedicated account team and was onsite weekly 2 to 3 times a week, the sales led also which handled most of the larger ISPs within the region. John Henry also owned an adult web hosting company by the name of Strictly Hosting. The ISP went out of business in 2001 after filing for bankruptcy protection and was acquired by Earthlink. The adult web hosting company also went out of business during 2001 and was sold to another adult web hosting company which continued its operations for a few years afterward.

== Baseball career ==
In 2002, at the age of 33, John Henry entered pro baseball, with Ted pulling strings to get him onto the Red Sox&#x27;s rookie team in the Gulf Coast League. Dubbed &quot;The Kid&#x27;s Kid&quot; by the media, John Henry had his father&#x27;s build but little of his baseball talent: after just two games (where he failed to get a hit in six at-bats), he broke two ribs crashing into the stands in an attempt to catch a foul ball, ending his season. In 2003, Williams signed with the Schaumburg Flyers of the independent Northern League but was released in spring training. Later that season, John Henry played for two teams in the independent Southeastern League: the Selma Cloverleafs and the Baton Rouge Riverbats, where he hit a combined .149 in 27 games.

== Alcor controversy ==
John Henry&#x27;s father Ted died on July 5, 2002. Announcing there would be no funeral, he had Ted&#x27;s body flown to the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Scottsdale, Arizona, and placed in cryonic suspension. John Henry&#x27;s lawyer produced an informal family pact signed by Ted, John Henry, and Claudia in which they agreed &quot;to be put into biostasis after we die&quot; to &quot;be able to be together in the future, even if it is only a chance.&quot;

In his book, &quot;Ted Williams: An American Hero&quot;, Leigh Montville disputes this document, as he believes it to be a &quot;practice autograph&quot; with the rest of the contract written around it: It was signed &quot;Ted Williams&quot;, whereas Williams typically signed legal documents with his full name (Theodore), according to Montville.

Barbara Joyce (Bobbie Jo) Ferrell, Ted&#x27;s daughter by his first wife, sued John Henry, claiming that Ted wanted to be cremated, and she led a very public campaign against her half-brother. Ferrell, who was in contact with her father but had only met her siblings a few times, had been disinherited by Williams. She also alleged John Henry was planning to sell their father&#x27;s DNA, a charge John Henry disputed. A judge ruled that the signature on the family pact was Ted&#x27;s, and the note would stand as his final request. On December 20, 2002, Ferrell withdrew her objections after a judge agreed that a $645,000 trust would be distributed equally among the siblings.

== Death ==
In October 2003, it was announced that John Henry had been diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, the same disease that claimed Ted&#x27;s brother, Danny, in 1960. He began chemotherapy, and underwent a bone marrow transplant with a donation from Claudia. He died with Claudia and Dolores at his side on March 6, 2004, at the UCLA Medical Center. He was 35.

John Henry&#x27;s body was then transported to Alcor, in further fulfillment of the agreement.

<text>Kinnie () is a Maltese bittersweet carbonated soft drink brewed from bitter oranges and extracts of wormwood. It was first introduced in 1952 by the brewery Simonds Farsons Cisk, and continues to be produced by Farsons in Mrieħel, Birkirkara, Malta.

Kinnie is brown, and is drunk straight or mixed with alcohol. It holds a reputation for being Malta&#x27;s favourite non-alcoholic beverage, sometimes even called the &#x27;national soft drink&#x27;.

==History==
Kinnie was invented by Simonds Farsons Cisk&#x27;s managing director Anthony Miceli Farrugia and was first produced in 1952 as an alternative to the cola drinks that proliferated in post-war Europe, specifically Coca-Cola. Its taste was deliberately kept different from its international competition due to branding reasons. In 1975, it became the soft drink of the year of the French Comité International d&#x27;Action Gastronomique et Touristique.

Kinnie&#x27;s recipe is kept secret, though it is speculated to contain ginseng and rhubarb.

A &quot;Diet&quot; version for Kinnie appeared in 1984. In 2007, a new low calorie version of Kinnie called &quot;Kinnie Zest&quot; was made available. This has a stronger orange flavour, and is advertised as only having one calorie per bottle. Simonds started selling Kinnie Vita in 2014, which is sweetened using a blend of sugar and stevia leaf extract. In April 2021, Kinnie launched an alcoholic version of the drink called &#x27;Kinnie Spritz&#x27;.

==Sales locations==
Kinnie is exported to the UK, Italy, Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, Libya, and Canada, while also being available in Japan.

Kinnie is produced in Birkirkara, Malta by Maltese Beverages Pty Limited, under a licence from Farsons.

In March 2009, it was announced that Farsons were going to start exporting Kinnie into Russia. In the summer of 2010, Farsons and Kinnie UK Limited soft-launched Kinnie and its two variants in London&#x27;s West End, reaching almost 100 trial outlets by September 2010.

<text>Exotic probability is a branch of probability theory that deals with probabilities which are outside the normal range of [0, 1]. 

According to the author of various papers on exotic probability, Saul Youssef, the valid possible alternatives for probability values are the real numbers, the complex numbers and the quaternions. Youssef also cites the work of Richard Feynman, P. A. M. Dirac, Stanley Gudder and S. K. Srinivasan as relevant to exotic probability theories.

Of the application of such theories to quantum mechanics, Bill Jefferys has said: &quot;Such approaches are also not necessary and in my opinion they confuse more than they illuminate.&quot;

<doc id="511713" wikidata="Q29367260" url="?curid=511713" title="Gulfstream G550">
<text>The Gulfstream G550 is an American business jet aircraft produced by the General Dynamics&#x27; Gulfstream Aerospace unit in Savannah, Georgia, US. The certification designation is GV-SP. A version with reduced fuel capacity was marketed as the G500. Gulfstream ceased production of the G550 in July 2021.

The U.S. Military uses the Gulfstream G550 design as the C-37B and EA-37B Compass Call, the related Gulfstream V is the C-37A.

==Development==
The first production G550 (GV-SP) flew on 18 July 2002 and the aircraft received its FAA type certificate on August 14, 2003. In 2014, Gulfstream looked at a re-engine with the Rolls-Royce Pearl BR700 development announced in May 2018 for the new Global Express 5500 and 6500 variants but preferred the BR725-powered, 7,500 nmi G650. The 500th Gulfstream G550 aircraft was delivered in May 2015.

Deliveries went from 50 aircraft in 2011 to 19 in 2016 and with 40 units for sale in a fleet of 540. Valuations of the G550 are falling: a 10-year-old G550 valued $28 million a year before is worth $18-$20 million in January 2017, while a two-year-old went from $40 to $35 million. In May 2017, early 2003 G550s were valued at $14 million against more than $45 million for newly purchased aircraft, flying an average of 425 hours per year. In December 2018, a 2012-2013 G550 was valued $28-31 million, and cost $7,135 per hour for 400 hours a year.

As it was replaced by the Gulfstream G600 by October 2019, the G550 was kept in limited production for long-term special missions applications and government orders.

The final commercially available G550 was delivered in June 2021 after more than 600 of the aircraft were produced.

==Design==
Compared to the Gulfstream V, drag reduction details boost range by and increase fuel efficiency. Maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is increased by and takeoff performance is enhanced. A seventh pair of windows is added and the entry door is moved forward to increase usable cabin length. The PlaneView flight deck features cursor control devices, Honeywell Primus Epic avionics, standard head-up guidance system by Rockwell Collins and enhanced vision system by Elbit, improving situational awareness in reduced visibility conditions.

Initial long-range cruise altitude is FL 400-410, first hour fuel burn is decreasing for the second hour to for the last hour. Flight hourly budget is $700-950 for engine reserves, $250 for parts and 2.5 maintenance hours. It competes against the Bombardier Global 6000, which has higher direct operating costs and less range but a more spacious cross section, and the Dassault Falcon 7X with fly-by-wire flight controls, better fuel efficiency and a wider but shorter cabin.

==Variants==
:The same as the Gulfstream V or GV with a new flightdeck display system, airframe aerodynamic and engine improvements, main entry door moved forward, also marketed as the G550.

;G500
:The Gulfstream G500 has a reduced fuel capacity. Introduced in 2004 as a shorter range version, it has the same exterior appearance, as well as the PlaneView cockpit, but Visual Guidance System (HUD) and Enhanced Vision System (EVS) are options. Its unit cost was .
;G550
:Marketing name for the GV-SP. In 2021, its equipped price was $54.5M (~$ in ).

;C-37B
:U.S. military designation for the G550 in a VIP passenger configuration.
;EA-37B Compass Call
:U.S. military designation G550 version in an Electronic Warfare configuration to replace USAF&#x27;s existing EC-130H Compass Call aircraft. Previously known as EC-37B, on November 14, 2023, Air Combat Command redesignated the platform as EA-37B to better identify its mission of finding and attacking enemy land or sea targets.
;NC-37B
:U.S. military designation for proposed G550 with the &quot;Conformal AEW&quot; body shape for use as range telemetry aircraft for U.S. Navy.
;MC-55A Peregrine
:Royal Australian Air Force designation for SIGINT and ELINT intelligence gathering variant.
;G550 CAEW
:Israel has acquired a number of G550s, fitted with the EL/W-2085 sensor package (a newer derivative of the Phalcon system) for Airborne Early Warning (AEW) use and named the aircraft &quot;Eitam&quot;. This aircraft is heavily modified for the AEW role by Gulfstream&#x27;s partner, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), and is also called CAEW (Conformal Airborne Early Warning) by Gulfstream Special Missions Department. Israel has also acquired a number of G550s dubbed SEMA (Special Electronic Missions Aircraft) with systems EL/I-3001 integration also carried out by IAI. In 2012, Italy acquired two G550 CAEWs as part of a counter-deal to Israel&#x27;s $1 billion (~$ in ) order for 30 Alenia Aermacchi M-346 advanced jet trainers. In 2022, Italy ordered two additional aircraft. Singapore ordered four similar G550 CAEW aircraft equipped with the EL/W-2085 sensor package from Gulfstream and IAI.

<text>Es (С с; italics: &quot;С с&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script.

It commonly represents the voiceless alveolar fricative , like the pronunciation of in &quot;sand&quot;.

==History==
The Cyrillic letter Es is derived from a variant of the Greek letter Sigma known as &quot;lunate sigma&quot; (Ϲ ϲ), in use in the Greek-speaking world in early medieval times. “Es” (Cyrillic: С) is related to the Latin letter “C” (C c), visuo-phono-semantically due to being a homoglyph and having similar roots, which C is a descendant of the Greek letter Gamma (Γ γ), and therefore С is related to the Latin C and Latin G. While the Cyrillic “С” represents the /s/ sound, many languages apply the value of to the Latin letter “C,” especially before front vowels like ‘‘e’’ and ‘‘i’’ (examples include English, French, Portuguese, and Latin American Spanish). This distinction between “hard” and “soft” C reflects historical phonetic shifts. As its name suggests, “Es” is also related to the Latin letter “S.”

The name of Es in the Early Cyrillic alphabet was (&quot;slovo&quot;), meaning &quot;word&quot; or &quot;speech&quot;.

In the Cyrillic numeral system, Es had a value of 200.

==Form==
In the modern Latinized Cyrillic fonts in use today, the Cyrillic letter Es looks exactly like the Latin letter C, being one of six letters in the Cyrillic alphabet that share appearances with Latin alphabet letters but are pronounced differently (or at least differently from the most common pronunciation). This fact has been frequently abused by plagiarism detector circumventors.

==Usage==
As used in the alphabets of various languages, Es represents the following sounds:
*voiceless alveolar fricative , like the pronunciation of in &quot;sand&quot;
*palatalized voiceless alveolar fricative 

The pronunciations shown in the table are the primary ones for each language; for details consult the articles on the languages.

<text>CityLink is a network of tollways in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, linking the Tullamarine, West Gate and Monash Freeways and incorporating Bolte Bridge, Burnley Tunnel and other works. In 1996, Transurban was awarded the contract to augment two existing freeways and construct two new toll roads – labelled the Western and Southern Links – directly linking a number of existing freeways to provide a continuous, high-capacity road route to, and around, the central business district. CityLink uses a free-flow tolling electronic toll collection system, called e-TAG. CityLink is currently maintained by Transurban.

==History==
The first mention of a southern and western inner city bypass was in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan. The plan advocated for reservations and set aside sinking funds for the new inner city freeway system. It was one of the few freeways connecting to the inner city (along with the Eastern Freeway to Clifton Hill) which was not later abandoned.

The proposal to build CityLink was first announced in May 1992 and received the State Government&#x27;s formal approval in mid-1994. The contract was awarded in 1995 to a consortium of Australia&#x27;s Transfield Holdings and Japan&#x27;s Obayashi Corporation, named Transurban Consortium. Transurban was formed in March 1996 to operate CityLink when completed. The total value of the project was estimated in 1996 at about $1.8 billion, and the concession to operate the road was initially due to expire in 2034. This concession has since been extended, and is now due to expire in 2045.

CityLink was built by the Transfield Obayashi joint venture under contract to Transurban between 1996 and 2000. The design and construction of the Western Link was subcontracted to Baulderstone Hornibrook, and the supply of the electronic tolling system was subcontracted to Translink Systems, a company jointly owned by Transfield Holdings and Transroute of France. The ongoing operation and maintenance of City Link was subcontracted by Transurban to Translink Operations, also jointly owned by Transfield and Transroute, which would manager the performance of CityLink assets. In May 1999, the operations were reorganised, with Transurban taking over the customer service operations from Translink Operations, who would retain responsibility for management of the tolling system, roadside assistance and maintenance.

The CityLink project was eight times larger than any other road project in Melbourne of that time. Toll plazas for manual tolling were deemed impractical, and delays associated with plaza operations would have decreased the advantages of using the new road. The decision to use only electronic toll collection was made in 1992; at a time when there was little practical experience of such systems. The first of the sections opened to traffic in 15 August 1999, with tolling commencing on 3 January 2000 before final completion occurred on 28 December 2000 with tolling commencing the same year.

When CityLink opened in 1999, the Southern Link was signed as M1 and the Western Link was signed as Metropolitan Route 43. Metropolitan Route 43 previously terminated at the Tullamarine Freeway/Calder Freeway interchange but it was extended along CityLink to end in Port Melbourne. Whilst National Route 79 officially remained part of the Western Link from the opening until 2013 (as the previous Tullamarine Freeway carried this designation from Calder Freeway to Flemington Road), CityLink signage did not show any National Route 79 signage and was exclusively signed as Metropolitan Route 43. With Victoria&#x27;s conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in the late 1990s, Metropolitan Route 43 slowly began transition to M2 and was finally replaced with M2 in 2018. Despite this, a number of Metropolitan Route 43 shields remain visible to this day.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads. CityLink is a privately-owned and operated tollway, but in June 2004, VicRoads became responsible for managing the CityLink concession contract and the state&#x27;s assets (such as physical infrastructure including roads, bridges, tunnels and the tolling system operated by CityLink, due to be transferred to the state at the end of the concession period) under that contract, in an effort to improve the integration of CityLink with the rest of the road network. Later in 2004, it re-declared the Tullamarine Freeway to terminate at Mount Alexander Road (sign-posted as Bulla Road) in Strathmore, south of Essendon Airport: CityLink&#x27;s Western Link officially begins east of this interchange in Strathmore, and ends with its interchange with West Gate Freeway in Port Melbourne. At the same time, VicRoads also re-declared the West Gate Freeway to terminate at Princes Highway East (today Kings Way) in Southbank, and the Monash Freeway to commence in Kooyong: CityLink&#x27;s Southern Link officially runs between these two points at Southbank and Kooyong.

==Infrastructure==
===Existing roads===
Previously, the city centre was served by three separate freeways:
*The South Eastern Freeway (today the Monash Freeway), which had begun approximately 2 km south-east of the city, and connects Melbourne to the outlying rural Gippsland area;
*The Tullamarine Freeway, which had begun approximately 5 km north-west of the city, and links Melbourne to Melbourne Airport, and also joins the Calder Freeway, which links Melbourne to Bendigo;
*The West Gate Freeway which began in Southbank in the city&#x27;s south, crossed the Yarra River over the West Gate Bridge and joined to both the Princes Freeway (linking to Geelong) and the Western Ring Road in Laverton North.

CityLink saw the linking of all three of these freeways: extending both the South Eastern and Tullamarine Freeways to join the West Gate Freeway. This also subsumed an existing portion of both the South Eastern and Tullamarine Freeways into the new project: while these portions were widened and upgraded, as part of the CityLink project they were also tolled, attracting criticism from road users.

===New roads===
====Western Link====
The elevated Western Link extended the existing Tullamarine Freeway, lengthening it to terminate it five kilometres further south at the West Gate Freeway in Port Melbourne, for a total distance of 12.9 km. It included a new major bridge (the Bolte Bridge, named after former Victorian Premier Sir Henry Bolte) over the Yarra River in the Docklands district; a long elevated section over Dudley Flats and Moonee Ponds Creek and a tube-like sound barrier in Flemington where the road passes close to a number of community housing towers. A short distance to the north of the sound tube, a massive sculptural work was placed, called the Melbourne International Gateway, consisting of a giant yellow beam hanging diagonally across the road (nicknamed the &quot;Cheesestick&quot;) and a row of smaller red beams alongside the road (the &quot;Zipper&quot;, or &quot;rack of lamb&quot;). The existing portion of Tullamarine Freeway between Flemington Road and Bulla Road was subsumed into the Western Link, and was also widened, with a transit lane being added in each direction between Flemington Road and Pascoe Vale Road.

This section of Freeway was originally designated in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan as part of the F14 Freeway Corridor.

====Southern Link====
The underground Southern Link directly connects the ends of the West Gate and Monash Freeways into one continuous through-way, for a total distance of 8.0 km. This link comprises the Burnley and Domain Tunnels which pass under the Royal Botanic Gardens and the Yarra River, each tunnel channelling traffic in different directions. The existing portion of South Eastern Freeway between Toorak Road and Batman Avenue was subsumed into the Southern Link, and was also widened.

This section of Freeway was shown in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan as part of the F9 Freeway corridor as a surface-level road.

====Batman Avenue====
The Exhibition Street Extension – not a part of the initial project, as it had been promoted as a bypass that would keep cars out of the CBD – consisted of a new four-lane, divided road extending south from the intersection of Flinders and Exhibition Streets in the CBD and spanning the Jolimont rail yards to connect with Batman Avenue near Melbourne Park Tennis Centre. Construction was managed by VicRoads on behalf of the Department of Infrastructure and began in November 1997, for a total distance of 1.9 km completed to coincide with the opening of CityLink. The alignment of Batman Avenue, previously following the northern bank of the Yarra River north of Swan Street to terminate at Swanston Street just north of Princes Bridge, was re-routed to follow this new road; the route 70 tram, previously using this alignment, was also re-routed to run on a dedicated median behind the Melbourne Park complex and re-join the new road before it crossed the rail lines, commencing along this new route from 7 June 1999. It was officially opened as Batman Avenue on 1 November 1999; the former alignment is now a pedestrianised walking track. Costing $30 million, the access road was built as part of CityLink and therefore attracts tolls.

== CityLink–Tulla Widening (2015–2018) ==

=== Project overview ===

The freeway had extensive upgrades between 2015 and 2018, including the addition of lanes as part of the CityLink Tulla Widening Project.

=== Original proposal (2014) ===
The original project was announced in April 2014 by then-Premier Denis Napthine as an unsolicited proposal by Transurban, with Transurban providing the bulk of the funds for the upgrade. The original design would have involved the widening of the entire Western Link of Citylink up to Bulla Road (Stage 1) and the Tullamarine Freeway from Bulla Road to Melrose Drive (Stage 2). In addition, Transurban&#x27;s tolling concession was extended by a year, to 2035. Work on the original upgrade was expected to commence construction early–mid 2015, and was expected for completion by early–mid 2018. The original project was designed to complement the former East West Link project which was cancelled after Daniel Andrews won government at the State election in November 2014. This led to the original project being postponed and modified.

=== Final proposal (2015–2018) ===
In August 2015 a new proposal to widen the Citylink and Tullamarine Freeways was put into action by the recently elected Premier Daniel Andrews. The project consists of two stages which would increase the road&#x27;s daily capacity as well as shorten trips between Melbourne Airport and the CBD during morning peak and afternoon peak times. The following upgrades started in October 2015 (Stage 1) and May 2016 (Stage 2). The entire project is completed by late 2018.
The upgrade involves the construction of a new lane in each direction from Melbourne Airport to Power Street, upgrades to the Bell Street, Flemington Road, English Street and Mickleham Road intersections, and the creation of a dedicated lane between the Calder and Tullamarine Freeways to Bell Street, to reduce weaving. Speed limits will be lowered on parts of the freeway during construction work, and after construction, as a result of lane narrowing. The project will also install an electronic freeway management system, involving CCTV cameras, a variable speed limit, and electronic message signs.

Controversy has arisen due to the proximity of Strathmore Secondary College to the new ramp at Bell Street. The removal of a tree as part of the Flemington Road intersection upgrade also resulted in public protest.

==== Stage 1 (Bulla Road to Power Street) ====
* Lane use management signs to manage which lanes are open
* Variable speed limit signs above all lanes
* Ramp signalling – stop and go traffic lights to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion as traffic enters the freeway from on-ramps
* CCTV cameras – to monitor for incidents, help response times and minimise disruptions
* Travel time information signs so people can plan their journey
* Electronic message signs – to notify road users of planned changes or disruptions
* Automatic incident detection system – to alert road managers of incidents in real time
* Two dedicated lanes inbound to Bell Street from the Tullamarine Freeway and Calder Freeway
* New Bell Street to Pascoe Vale Road
* Improvements to Flemington Road/ Mount Alexander Road Freeway Interchange
* Additional outbound lane between Moreland and Ormond Road
* Ramp widening between Bolte Bridge and West Gate Freeway
* One additional inbound lane between Montague Street and Ingles Street
* One additional inbound lane between Montague Street and Power Street

==== Stage 2 (Melbourne Airport to Bulla Road) ====
* A new structure with dedicated lanes from the Tullamarine Freeway and Mickleham Road to the M80 Ring Road inbound to ease congestion and reduce traffic weaving 
* An extra lane entering the Tullamarine Freeway city bound from Mickleham Road 
* Reconstruction and widening of the English Street overpass and all ramps to increase capacity into and out of Essendon Fields 
* Ramp signals on the city bound entry from Kings Road in Taylors Lakes to the Tulla Calder interchange to regulate the flow of traffic getting onto the Tullamarine Freeway from the Calder Freeway 

==== Extra lanes ====
Part of the upgrade is adding more lanes between Melbourne Airport and the West Gate Freeway. Between the Citylink (Western Link) and the West Gate Freeway, one additional lane in each direction will be added consuming the current emergency lanes as well as lower the current speed limit from 100 km/h down to 80 km/h.

== Tolling system ==

There are no toll booths along the entire length of the system, so traffic flow is not impeded.

CityLink uses a DSRC toll system called e-TAG, where an electronic transponder is mounted on the inside of vehicles&#x27; windscreens. Gantries constructed over each carriageway record registration plates and detect the e-TAGs, and deduct toll amounts automatically from the account linked electronically to each tag. Where a tag is not detected, the vehicle&#x27;s registration is recorded using an automatic number plate recognition system and checked against a database. For infrequent use of the system one can buy a Daypass – by phone, online, at any Australia Post outlet or at participating service stations. A Daypass can be bought in advance or afterwards (until midnight three days later). If payment has not been made, the vehicle&#x27;s registered owner will be sent a late toll invoice in the mail, and if the late toll invoice is then not paid a fine will be issued by Civic Compliance Victoria.

In 2018 CityLink tolling accounts were rebranded as Linkt, as part of parent company Transurban combining their existing retail brands.

The concession period held by Transurban is due to end in 2045, after which the ownership of the road will be transferred to the state. It was originally due to end in January 2035, but was extended as part of a deal with Transurban to build the West Gate Tunnel project.

===Toll points===
Multiple toll points are located along the CityLink, with each toll point charging a fixed fee. The CityLink toll points also include the toll point at the Exhibition Street extension (Batman Avenue). The total toll incurred per trip is the smaller of the trip cap or the total price of toll points passed through.

The entry and exit ramps of CityLink (excluding West Gate Freeway) have been constructed in a way that travelling on any section of CityLink will always pass through at least one toll point. The only exception is eastbound travel between Punt Road and Church Street, which does not pass through a toll point and hence does not incur any tolls.

== Controversies ==
As part of the development of CityLink, portions of existing roads were subsumed into the CityLink project: while they too were upgraded and expanded, tolling points were also added. Toll charges now apply to the former Monash Freeway between Toorak Road and Punt Road, and the former Tullamarine Freeway south of Bulla Road. Previously public roads, they did not incur tolls to use before.

Some nearby roads were altered to restrict rat runs to stop people using neighbourhood back streets as short cuts to avoid the toll. Some people have viewed this as local councils &#x27;forcing&#x27; people to use CityLink.

CityLink account holders can, if they make multiple trips in a day, pay more to use the road than a casual user. A 24-hour Pass, for example, is charged at a flat rate, but an account holder pays per trip. Account holders who make multiple trips in a single day may pay more than a pass customer would. However, CityLink recognises this and account customers can remove their e-TAG device and buy a pass for the day: just like casual customers. However, there is a limit to the number of passes that can be bought each 12 months. This limit applies to account holders and casual users.

The contract between the government and CityLink&#x27;s owner Transurban has protections for both parties. One of these is the ability for Transurban to make a claim against the state government if the state government does something that reduces the number of cars that could use CityLink. In 2001 Transurban commenced legal proceedings against the State of Victoria over the construction of Wurundjeri Way through the Melbourne Docklands. It was alleged that this &#x27;free&#x27; road was competing with CityLink and causing it to earn less revenue. This can potentially also be applied if the capacity of other roads or rail routes parallel to CityLink are expanded, however the contract specifically excludes compensation if the metropolitan rail network is extended to Melbourne Airport.

CityLink received negative media coverage when it was wrongly claimed that CityLink account holders&#x27; credit card details were stored on Transurban&#x27;s public webserver and that someone had broken into the system and stolen tens of thousands of customers details. Customer details were stolen, not by an intruder via the web, but by a former employee who had misused access to the secure IT systems.

The two CityLink tunnels have regularly featured as discussion points on talkback radio, firstly for air quality. In the early days of operation, the air quality in the tunnels appeared smoggy. CityLink worked a way around the problem by adjusting the venting system which improved quality and dispersed exhaust fumes more effectively. The second issue was regarding the use of massive quantities of fresh drinking water pumped into the system to stabilise the tunnel environs. After some time, CityLink sought and obtained approval from the State Government to build a water recycling plant which meant they could rely primarily on recycled, and not drinking, water.

<text>Mac OS 8 is the eighth major release of the classic Mac OS operating system for Macintosh computers, released by Apple Computer on July 26, 1997. It includes the largest overhaul of the classic Mac OS experience since the release of System 7, approximately six years before. It places a greater emphasis on color than prior versions. Released over a series of updates, Mac OS 8 represents an incremental integration of many of the technologies which had been developed from 1988 to 1996 for Apple&#x27;s ambitious OS named Copland. Mac OS 8 helped modernize the Mac OS while Apple developed its next-generation operating system, Mac OS X (renamed in 2012 to OS X and then in 2016 to macOS).

Mac OS 8 is one of Apple&#x27;s most commercially successful software releases, selling over 1.2 million copies in the first two weeks. As it came at a difficult time in Apple&#x27;s history, many pirate groups refused to traffic in the new OS, encouraging people to buy it instead.

Mac OS 8.0 introduces the most visible changes in the lineup, including the Platinum interface and a native PowerPC multithreaded Finder. Mac OS 8.1 introduces a new, more efficient file system named HFS Plus. Mac OS 8.5 is the first version of the Mac OS to require a PowerPC processor. It features PowerPC native versions of QuickDraw, AppleScript, and the Sherlock search utility. Its successor, Mac OS 9, was released on October 23, 1999.

==Copland==
Starting in 1988, Apple&#x27;s next-generation operating system, which it originally envisioned to be &quot;System 8&quot; was codenamed Copland. It was announced in March 1994 alongside the introduction of the first PowerPC Macs. Apple intended Copland as a fully modern system, including native PowerPC code, intelligent agents, a microkernel, a customizable interface named Appearance Manager, a hardware abstraction layer, and a relational database integrated into the Finder. Copland was to be followed by Gershwin, which promised memory protection spaces and full preemptive multitasking. The system was intended to be a full rewrite of the Mac OS, and Apple hoped to beat Microsoft Windows 95 to market with a development cycle of only one year.

The Copland development was hampered by many missed deadlines. The release date was first pushed back to the end of 1995, then to mid-1996, late 1996, and finally to the end of 1997. With a dedicated team of 500 software engineers and an annual budget of $250 million, Apple executives began to grow impatient with the project continually falling behind schedule. In August 1996, Apple chief technology officer Ellen Hancock froze development of Copland and Apple began a search for an operating system developed outside the company. This ultimately led to Apple buying NeXT and developing Rhapsody which would eventually evolve into Mac OS X in 2001 (now named macOS).

At the Worldwide Developers Conference in January 1997, Apple chief executive officer (CEO) Gil Amelio announced that, rather than release Copland as one monolithic release, Copland features would be phased into the Mac OS following a six-month release cycle. These updates began with Mac OS 7.6, released during WWDC. Mac OS 8.0, released six months later, continued to integrate Copland technologies into the Mac OS.

==Mac OS 8.0==
Developed with the codename &quot;Tempo&quot;, Mac OS 8.0 was announced on July 22, 1997, and released on July 26. The early beta releases of the product which were circulated to developers and Apple internal audiences, were branded as Mac OS 7.7, superseding the then-current release, Mac OS 7.6. The software was renamed Mac OS 8 before final release.

Major changes in this version included the Platinum theme, a Finder which was PowerPC-native and multithreaded, and greater customization of the user interface.

Other features introduced in Mac OS 8.0 include the following:

*Customization of system fonts and increased use of the user-set accent color.
*Pop-up context menus, accessed via ctrl-click with a one-button mouse.
*Pop-up (or tabbed) windows in the Finder.
*Spring-loaded folders.
*Live scrolling.
*WindowShade widget in window titlebars.
*Multithreaded Finder — file copy operations run in a separate thread and don&#x27;t block the Finder UI.
*Redesigned color picker.
*Desktop Pictures control panel, allowing photographs to be set as the desktop background; not only tiled patterns.
*Simple Finder, an option which reduces Finder menus to basic operations, to avoid overwhelming new users.
*Relocation of the &#x27;Help&#x27; menu from an icon at the right end of the menu bar to a standard textual menu positioned after the application&#x27;s menus.
*A faster Apple Guide, featuring HTML help pages.
*Native support of Apple Filing Protocol over IP.
*Performance improvements to virtual memory, AppleScript execution and system startup times.
*Faster desktop rebuilding.

==Mac OS 8.1==

Released on January 19, 1998, Mac OS 8.1 was the last version of the Mac OS to run on Macs with Motorola 68000 series processors. It addressed performance and reliability improvements. It introduced a new file system named HFS+, also named Mac OS Extended, which supported large file sizes and made more efficient use of larger hard drives via using a smaller block size. To upgrade, users must reformat the hard drive, which deletes the entire contents of the drive. Some third-party utilities later appeared that preserved the user&#x27;s data while upgrading to HFS+. The 68040 systems do not support booting from HFS+ disks; the boot drive must be HFS.

Mac OS 8.1 was the first system to have a Universal Disk Format (UDF) driver, allowing for DVD support on the Mac for the first time. It also shipped with the new Java runtime (JDK 1.1.3).

Mac OS 8.1 also included an enhanced version of PC Exchange, allowing Macintosh users to see the long file names (up to 255 characters) on files that were created on PCs running Microsoft Windows, and supporting FAT32.

Mac OS 8.1 is the earliest version of the Mac OS that can run Carbon applications. Carbon support requires a PowerPC processor and installation of the CarbonLib software from Apple&#x27;s website; it is not a standard component of Mac OS 8.1. Applications needing later versions of CarbonLib will not run on Mac OS 8.1. More recent versions of CarbonLib require Mac OS 8.6.

As part of Apple&#x27;s agreement with Microsoft, 8.1 included Internet Explorer 3 initially, but soon switched to Internet Explorer 4 as its default browser.

Mac OS 8.1 was free for Mac OS 8 owners and was available in February 1998 via the apple.com website.

==Mac OS 8.5==
Released October 16, 1998, Mac OS 8.5 was the first version of the Mac OS to run solely on Macs equipped with a PowerPC processor. If Mac OS 8.5 is installed on a 68k system, the Sad Mac error screen will appear. As such, it replaced some, but not all, of the 680x0 code with PowerPC code, improving system performance by relying less on 680x0 emulation.

It introduced the Sherlock search utility. This allowed users to search the contents of documents on hard drives (if the user had let it index the drive), or extend a search to the Internet. Sherlock plug-ins started appearing at this time; these allowed users to search the contents of other websites.

Mac OS 8.5 includes several performance improvements. Copying files over a network was faster than prior versions and Apple advertised it as being &quot;faster than Windows NT&quot;. AppleScript was also rewritten to use only PowerPC code, which improved AppleScript execution speed significantly.

Font Smoothing, system-wide antialiasing for type was also introduced. The HTML format for online help, first adopted by the Finder&#x27;s Info Center in Mac OS 8, was now used throughout. This made it easier for software companies to write online help systems. The PPP control panel was removed and replaced with Remote Access, which provides the same functionality but also allows connections to AppleTalk Remote Access (ARA) servers.

The installation process was simplified considerably in Mac OS 8.5. In earlier versions the installer worked in segments and often required a user to click to continue in between stages of the installation. This was a holdover from the days when the OS was distributed on multiple floppy disks, disk swapping promoting a natural segmentation model. The Mac OS 8.5 installer generally required very little user interaction once it was started. Customisation options were also much more detailed yet simpler to manage.

From Mac OS 8.5 onward, MacLinkPlus document translation software is no longer bundled as part of the Mac OS.

Mac OS 8.5 was the first version of the Mac OS to support themes, or skins, which could change the default Apple Platinum look of the Mac OS to &quot;Gizmo&quot; or &quot;HiTech&quot; themes. This radical changing of the computer&#x27;s appearance was removed at the last minute, and appeared only in beta versions, though users could still make (and share) their own themes and use them with the OS. The Appearance control panel was also updated to support proportional scroll bars, and added the option for both scroll arrows to be placed at the bottom of a scroll bar.

Along with themes support, 8.5 was the first version to support 32-bit icons. Icons now had 24-bit color (16.7 million colors) and an 8-bit alpha channel, allowing for transparency-translucency effects.

The &quot;application palette&quot; made its debut with 8.5 – the application menu at the right side of the menu bar could be resized to show the active application&#x27;s name, or &#x27;torn off&#x27; into a palette of buttons. This palette could be customized in many ways, by removing the window frame and changing the size and layout of the buttons. Apple provided no user interface to set these options, instead making them available via AppleScript and Apple Events and relying on third parties to provide a user interface for the task. By setting it to display horizontally and turning off the window border, the palette&#x27;s look and function could be configured to resemble the Windows 95 task bar.

===Mac OS 8.5.1===
Mac OS 8.5.1, released December 7, 1998, was a minor update to Mac OS 8.5 that fixes several bugs that caused crashes and data corruption.

==Mac OS 8.6==
Mac OS 8.6 was released on May 10, 1999, as a free update for Mac users running 8.5 and 8.5.1. It added support to the Mac OS nanokernel to handle preemptive tasks via the Multiprocessing Services 2.x and later developer API. Mac OS 8.6 improved PowerBook battery life, added Sherlock 2.1, and is faster and much more stable than either version of 8.5.x. It is the first version of Mac OS to display the version number as part of the startup screen. However, there is no process separation; the system still uses cooperative multitasking between processes, and even a process that is Multiprocessing Services-aware still has a portion that runs in the &quot;blue task&quot;, which also runs all programs that are unaware of it, and was the only task that can run 68k code.

== Reception ==
While CNET&#x27;s initial review of Mac OS 8 was more circumspect, its editorial staff named it one of the best products of 1997 in their year-end roundup.

<text>The Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, abbreviated as the Nakhichevan ASSR was an autonomous republic within the Azerbaijan SSR, itself a republic within the Soviet Union. It was formed on 16 March 1921 and became a part of the Azerbaijan SSR proper on 9 February 1924.

The first flag of the Nakhichevan ASSR was introduced in 1937 and contained both Azerbaijani and Armenian text. In the 1940s, when the Azerbaijani Latin alphabet was being replaced by Cyrillic, the previous flag was replaced by a Soviet flag with the Azerbaijani Cyrillic text &quot;Нахчыван МССР&quot; in gold and a dark blue bar along the fess.

In 1990, it became the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic within the Republic of Azerbaijan.

== History ==

===War and revolution===
In the final years of World War I, Nakhichevan was the scene of bloodshed between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, who both laid claim to the area. By 1914, the Armenian population had decreased slightly to 40% while the Azeri population increased to roughly 60%. After the February Revolution of 1917, the region was placed under the authority of the Special Transcaucasian Committee of the Russian Provisional Government and subsequently the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic (TDFR) in 1918. When the TDFR was dissolved in May 1918, Nakhichevan, Nagorno-Karabakh, Zangezur (today the Armenian province of Syunik and part of the province of Vayots Dzor), and Qazakh were heavily contested between the newly formed and short-lived states of the Democratic Republic of Armenia (DRA) and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR). In June 1918, the region came under Ottoman occupation. The Ottomans proceeded to massacre 10,000 Armenians and razed 45 of their villages to the ground. Under the terms of the Armistice of Mudros, the Ottomans agreed to pull their troops out of the Transcaucasus to make way for the forthcoming British military presence.

Under British occupation, Sir Oliver Wardrop, British Chief Commissioner in the South Caucasus, made a border proposal to solve the conflict. According to Wardrop, Armenian claims against Azerbaijan should not go beyond the administrative borders of the former Erivan Governorate (which under prior Imperial Russian rule encompassed Nakhichevan), while Azerbaijan was to be limited to the governorates of Baku and Elisabethpol. This proposal was rejected by both Armenians (who did not wish to give up their claims to Qazakh, Zangezur and Nagorno-Karabakh) and Azeris (who found it unacceptable to give up their claims to Nakhichevan). As disputes between both countries continued, it soon became apparent that the fragile peace under British occupation would not last.

In December 1918, with the support of Azerbaijan&#x27;s Musavat Party, Jafargulu Khan Nakhichevanski declared the Republic of Aras in the Nakhichevan uyezd of the former Erivan Governorate assigned to Armenia by Wardrop. The Armenian government did not recognize the new state and sent its troops into the region to take control of it. The conflict soon erupted into the violent Aras War. British journalist C.E. Bechhofer described the situation in April 1920:
By mid-June 1919, Armenia had established control over Nakhichevan and the whole territory of the self-proclaimed republic. The fall of the Aras republic triggered an invasion by the regular Azerbaijani army and by the end of July, Armenian troops were forced to leave Nakhichevan City to the Azeris. Again more violence erupted, leaving some 10,000 Armenians dead and 45 Armenian villages destroyed. Meanwhile, feeling the situation to be hopeless and unable to maintain any control over the area, the British decided to withdraw from the region in mid-1919. Still, fighting between Armenians and Azeris continued and after a series of skirmishes that took place throughout the Nakhichevan district, a ceasefire was agreed. This lasted only briefly, and by early March 1920, more fighting broke out, primarily in Karabakh between Karabakh Armenians and Azerbaijan&#x27;s regular army. This triggered conflicts in other areas with mixed populations, including Nakhichevan.

===Sovietization===
In July 1920, the 11th Soviet Red Army invaded and occupied the region and on 28 July, declared the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic with &quot;close ties&quot; to the Azerbaijan SSR. In November, on the verge of taking over Armenia, the Bolsheviks, in order to attract public support, promised they would allot Nakhichevan to Armenia, along with Karabakh and Zangezur. This was fulfilled when Nariman Narimanov, leader of Bolshevik Azerbaijan issued a declaration celebrating the &quot;victory of Soviet power in Armenia,&quot; proclaimed that both Nakhichevan and Zangezur should be awarded to the Armenian people as a sign of the Azerbaijani people&#x27;s support for Armenia&#x27;s fight against the former DRA government:
Vladimir Lenin, although welcoming this act of &quot;great Soviet fraternity&quot; where &quot;boundaries had no meaning among the family of Soviet peoples,&quot; did not agree with the motion and instead called for the people of Nakhichevan to be consulted in a referendum. According to the formal figures of this referendum, held at the beginning of 1921, 90% of Nakhichevan&#x27;s population wanted to be included in the Azerbaijan SSR &quot;with the rights of an autonomous republic.&quot; The decision to make Nakhichevan a part of modern-day Azerbaijan was cemented 16 March 1921 in the Treaty of Moscow between Bolshevist Russia and Turkey. The agreement between Soviet Russia and Turkey also called for attachment of the former Sharur-Daralagez uyezd (which had a solid Azeri majority) to Nakhichevan, thus allowing Turkey to share a border with the Azerbaijan SSR. This deal was reaffirmed on 23 October, in the Treaty of Kars. Article V of the treaty stated the following:

So, on 16 March 1921 the Nakhichevan ASSR was established. On 9 February 1924, the Soviet Union officially placed the Nakhichevan ASSR under the jurisdiction of the Azerbaijan SSR. Its constitution was adopted on 18 April 1926.

===Soviet Union===
As a constituent part of the Soviet Union, tensions lessened over the ethnic composition of Nakhichevan or any territorial claims regarding it. Instead, it became an important point of industrial production with particular emphasis on the mining of minerals such as salt. Under Soviet rule, it was once a major junction on the Moscow–Tehran railway line as well as the Baku–Yerevan railway. It also served as an important strategic area during the Cold War, sharing borders with both Turkey (a NATO member state) and Iran (a close ally of the West until the Iranian Revolution of 1979).
Facilities improved during Soviet times; education and public health especially began to see some major changes. In 1913, Nakhichevan only had two hospitals with a total of 20 beds. The region was plagued by widespread diseases including trachoma and typhus. Malaria, which mostly came from the adjoining Aras River, brought serious harm to the region. At any one time, between 70% and 85% of Nakhichevan&#x27;s population was infected with malaria, and in the region of Norashen (present-day Sharur) almost 100% were struck with the disease. This situation improved dramatically under Soviet rule. Malaria was sharply reduced and trachoma, typhus, and relapsing fever were eliminated.

During the Soviet era, Nakhichevan saw a significant demographic shift. Its Armenian population gradually decreased as many emigrated to the Armenian SSR. In 1926, 15% of region&#x27;s population was Armenian, but by 1979, this number had shrunk to 1.4%. The Azeri population, meanwhile increased substantially with both a higher birth rate and immigration from Armenia (going from 85% in 1926 to 96% by 1979).

Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh noted similar though slower demographic trends and feared an eventual &quot;de-Armenianization&quot; of the area. When tensions between Armenians and Azeris were reignited in the late-1980s by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Azerbaijan&#x27;s Popular Front managed to pressure the Azerbaijan SSR to instigate a partial railway and air blockade against Armenia, while another reason for the disruption of rail service to Armenia were attacks of Armenian forces on the trains entering the Armenian territory from Azerbaijan, which resulted in railroad personnel refusing to enter Armenia. This effectively crippled Armenia&#x27;s economy, as 85% of the cargo and goods arrived through rail traffic. In response, Armenia closed the railway to Nakhichevan, thereby strangling the exclave&#x27;s only link to the rest of the Soviet Union.
December 1989 saw unrest in Nakhichevan as its Azeri inhabitants moved to physically dismantle the Soviet border with Iran to flee the area and meet their ethnic Azeri cousins in northern Iran. This action was angrily denounced by the Soviet leadership and the Soviet media accused the Azeris of &quot;embracing Islamic fundamentalism&quot;. In January 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Nakhichevan ASSR issued a declaration stating the intention for Nakhichevan to secede from the USSR to protest the Soviet Union&#x27;s actions during Black January. It was the first part of the Soviet Union to declare independence, preceding Lithuania&#x27;s declaration by almost 2 months.

Heydar Aliyev, the future president of Azerbaijan, returned to his birthplace of Nakhichevan in autumn 1990, after being ousted from his position in the Politburo by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987. Soon after returning to Nakhichevan, Aliyev was elected to the local Supreme Soviet by an overwhelming majority. Aliyev subsequently resigned from the CPSU and after the failed August 1991 coup against Gorbachev, he called for complete independence for Azerbaijan and denounced Ayaz Mütallibov for supporting the coup. In late 1991, Aliyev consolidated his power base as chairman of the Nakhichevan Supreme Soviet and asserted Nakhichevan&#x27;s near-total independence from Baku.

On 19 November 1990, it became the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic within the Republic of Azerbaijan.

== Commemoration ==

<text>Herbert Milton Stempel (December 19, 1926 – April 7, 2020) was an American television game show contestant and subsequent whistleblower on the fraudulent nature of the industry, in what became known as the 1950s quiz show scandals. His rigged six-week appearance as a winning contestant on the 1950s show &quot;Twenty-One&quot; ended in an equally rigged defeat by Columbia University teacher and literary scion Charles Van Doren.

== Early life ==
A self-described &quot;avid reader&quot; as a child, who was &quot;interested in everything&quot;, Stempel attended P.S. 89 in Queens. He was skipped ahead several classes in school, so much so that his mother worried he was being pushed too far. When he was seven, his father died, and Stempel, his mother, and his older sister Harriet moved to what he describes as a &quot;poorer part of the Bronx&quot;. It was in the midst of the Depression, and the struggling family was on public assistance for years.

&quot;Twenty-One&quot; was not Stempel&#x27;s first quiz show. At a very young age Stempel realized he had what he refers to as a &quot;retentive memory&quot;, in that he could read a page about a subject and then, months later, summarize that page. He represented his elementary school, P.S. 6, on a radio quiz show, &quot;Americana History&quot;, where he remained undefeated for several weeks. He was part of the &quot;Kid Wizards&quot;, a three-man team who represented The Bronx High School of Science in competitions against New York high schools, remaining undefeated throughout the year. He claims his IQ has been measured at 170.

Stempel graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in January 1944. He briefly attended classes at City College of New York (CCNY) before enlisting in the United States Army. He served in the 311th Regiment of the 78th Infantry Division and was on the front lines in Europe for a month before the war ended. Stempel remained in the Army for the next seven years, attending counterintelligence school in Baltimore, Maryland and serving as &quot;an agent&quot; until 1952, when he began work in the United States Post Office as a clerk. He married his wife, Toby, in 1954 and returned to CCNY on the G.I. Bill.

== &quot;Twenty-One&quot; ==

In 1956, after tuning in to a new program, &quot;Twenty-One&quot;, he was intrigued by the questions and wrote to Dan Enright, the show&#x27;s producer, asking to be a contestant. The qualifying trivia test took a grueling three-and-a-half hours; Stempel got 251 out of 363 questions right, which he claimed was the highest score ever achieved.

At a time when the top five highest-rated programs on television were quiz shows, &quot;Twenty-One&quot; was a mainstay for Barry &amp; Enright Productions and NBC, which aired the show:

Contestants on &quot;Twenty-One&quot; were given the questions and answers in advance and were coached as if they were actors, receiving instructions on which questions to answer correctly or incorrectly and how to behave during the game.

Several weeks later, Enright paid Stempel a visit while his wife was out at the theater and he was looking after their young son, and posed the fateful question: &quot;How would you like to make $25,000?&quot; Stempel immediately understood the implications; Enright was not going to pay him just for appearing on the show, when he could be easily defeated.

Stempel was not only provided with coaching on the answers and directions on how to deliver them, but on his physical appearance as well. Stempel was married to a woman whose family had money and the couple was not suffering financially, but Enright decided that the image of an underdog, a penniless GI working his way through school, would appeal to the American public. Enright personally selected his wardrobe: an oversized, baggy double-breasted suit that had belonged to Stempel&#x27;s late father-in-law, a blue shirt with a frayed collar, &quot;terrible looking&quot; tie and an old &quot;Timex watch that ticked like an alarm clock&quot;, the sound of which would be picked up by the studio microphone and thus help build suspense.

Enright later explained the reasons behind this:

You want the viewer to react emotionally to a contestant. Whether he reacts favorably or negatively is really not that important. The important thing is that he reacts. He should watch a contestant, hoping that the contestant will win or he should watch the contestant, hoping the contestant will lose. And Herb, I felt, was the type of personality who instilled the latter. Viewers would watch him and pray for his opponent to win. ... When he applied to the show and he took the test, he scored a very, very high score. He was the type of contestant who could very well antagonize viewers.

Stempel ostensibly won $69,500, which was presented to him as an unnotarized &quot;settlement&quot; agreement.

Even though Stempel agreed to take less money, that actually made no difference: his ratings were dropping and the producers decided he had to go. A new contestant was selected to challenge him and knock him off. He was an English instructor at Columbia University, Charles Van Doren. Van Doren was persuaded to go along with the fraud by an appeal that his appearance would help glamorize information and intellectualism. His impact was immediate and his name quickly became synonymous with quiz shows. For week after week, the two men battled it out, tying with scores of 21–21, as tens of millions of Americans tuned in to see if their new hero would beat Stempel.

Enright promised Stempel a subsequent television job if he would finish the performance they had started, but the final act, as choreographed by Enright, was particularly humiliating to Stempel. The question was, &quot;What motion picture won the Academy Award for 1955?&quot;

Years later Dan Enright stated in the WGBH documentary &quot;American Experience: The Quiz Show Scandal&quot; interview:

On December 5, 1956, Van Doren defeated Stempel before 15 million viewers. Van Doren went on to become the single most popular contestant in the quiz show&#x27;s early history, while Stempel became the forgotten man. (In the closing minutes of his last &quot;Twenty-One&quot; appearance, asked what he would do with his winnings, a subdued Stempel said that after provisions were made for his family, he would donate a modest sum to the City College Fund “to repay the people of the city of New York for the free education they have given me”.) After his loss, Stempel overheard one backstage technician say to another: &quot;At least, we finally have a clean-cut intellectual on this program, not a freak with a sponge memory.&quot; Enright&#x27;s promise to find Stempel a panel show slot after his college graduation went unfulfilled. When Stempel, who by then had gone through his winnings, later demanded Enright follow through on his original promise, Enright demanded he first sign a statement affirming he had never been coached on &quot;Twenty-One&quot;. Again, no show materialized.

=== Exposure ===
When Enright subsequently told him the promise could not be kept because he had sold his shows to NBC itself, Stempel called Jack O&#x27;Brian, a columnist who covered television for the New York City &quot;Journal-American&quot;. Although O&#x27;Brian found the story hung together, the paper&#x27;s syndicate, fearing a libel suit, refused to print the allegation without further corroboration. Stempel later testified to Congress that in February 1957 he had spoken with a reporter from the &quot;New York Post&quot;, but that paper had the same reservations as the &quot;Journal-American&quot;. There were no corroborating witnesses or hard evidence to back up Stempel&#x27;s accusations, and Enright dismissed them as being rooted in jealousy over Van Doren&#x27;s success.

It took Ed Hilgemeier, a contestant-in-waiting who found a notebook full of answers belonging to Marie Winn, another contestant on the new quiz show &quot;Dotto,&quot; airing on CBS, to convince authorities and the &quot;Journal-American&quot; that Stempel should be taken seriously.

Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joseph Stone, who directed two grand jury probes into the case, states that Enright described Stempel to him as &quot;a disturbed person and a blackmailer&quot; and denied ever giving Stempel advance questions and answers. Three days after &quot;Twenty-One&quot; contestant Richard Jackman, a writer from Oneonta, New York, told Stone that he, too, had been coached in advance of his appearance on October 3, &quot;Twenty-One&quot; was canceled. The investigation of the quiz show scandal then began in earnest. Jackman only realized the game was fixed the night he appeared, when the questions he was asked were identical to the ones Enright had reviewed with him in a &quot;practice session&quot; that afternoon.

Enright quickly countered, denying any wrongdoing or fraud had taken place, suing the &quot;Journal-American&quot;, and mounting a campaign to discredit Stempel. At a sensational press conference, he attempted to demonstrate that Stempel was mentally unstable by playing a recording of a conversation with him that Enright had secretly taped. To further discredit him, Enright also produced the statement that Stempel had signed earlier, declaring that &quot;Twenty-One&quot; was an honest program, that Barry and Enright were beyond reproach, and that no rigging had taken place.

Jack O&#x27;Brian felt there was an &quot;undercurrent&quot; of coercion going on. Not only did some of the producers lie to the grand jury, they also had urged contestants to perjure themselves. In lower Manhattan, the grand jury was convened for nine months and heard testimony from more than 150 contestants. It is estimated that more than 100 lied under oath. Stempel continued telling the truth to anyone who would listen, but it was his unsubstantiated word against everyone else&#x27;s; there was still no hard corroborating evidence. His testimony to the DA and the grand jury implicated Van Doren in the fraud, but there was massive resistance in accepting this accusation.

Suddenly, to everyone&#x27;s astonishment, the grand jury testimony was sealed from the public by Judge Mitchell Schweitzer, for reasons that to this day are still not clear. This was almost an unprecedented move in New York State; in the no fewer than 497 grand jury presentments that had been filed in New York county since 1869, not one had ever been sealed. Afraid that the public might never learn what the grand jury had uncovered, Frank Hogan, the New York County District Attorney (and a former classmate of Judge Schweitzer), filed a protest in the court of general sessions, spelling out why it was in the public interest to make the findings known. Suspicious of a cover-up, Congress called an immediate investigation. Once just a trivial form of entertainment, quiz shows were now the subject of investigation at the highest level of government.

Stempel told the U.S. House Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight what he told Stone. Particularly jarring was Stempel&#x27;s revelation that he was strong-armed into incorrectly identifying what was, in fact, one of his favorite films:

The kinescope that has survived of that episode shows that the round in which Stempel was ordered to provide the wrong answer actually ended in a tie. Stempel and Van Doren went on to yet another game during the same show. This time, Stempel failed to recall the name of William Allen White&#x27;s popular editorials, &quot;What&#x27;s the Matter with Kansas?&quot; &quot;It just wouldn&#x27;t help to guess,&quot; Stempel said softly in the booth, &quot;I just don&#x27;t know.&quot; The miss kept Stempel at zero, and Van Doren answered the questions in the category &quot;Kings&quot; successfully. Stempel drew the evening&#x27;s biggest laugh when he was asked the fate of four of Henry VIII&#x27;s wives and answered, &quot;They all died.&quot; Stempel answered the question correctly, but when offered their standard opportunity to stop the game, Van Doren stopped it and became the new &quot;Twenty-One&quot; champion.

As the investigation progressed, Charles Van Doren, now a host on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, was under pressure from NBC to testify. To avoid the committee&#x27;s subpoena, he went into hiding. It was another former &quot;Twenty-One&quot; contestant, an artist named James Snodgrass, who finally provided indisputable supporting proof that the show had been rigged. Snodgrass had documented every answer he was coached on in a series of registered letters he mailed to himself before the show was taped.

One month after the hearings began, Van Doren emerged from hiding and confessed before the committee that he had been complicit in the fraud.

=== Life after the scandal ===
Following the scandal, Stempel finished college on the G.I. Bill. He went to work for the New York City Transportation Department for the next two decades, performing examinations before trial, which meant he represented the Department in depositions by opposing counsel, testifying to various records in the city&#x27;s possession.

It was not until he was approached, some thirty years later, by the producers of the documentary &quot;The Quiz Show Scandals&quot; for PBS&#x27;s American Experience, that he finally agreed to be interviewed on the subject. Julian Krainin, who co-produced the film, also co-produced the 1994 feature film &quot;Quiz Show&quot;, in which Stempel was portrayed by John Turturro. Stempel actually made an uncredited film debut in that movie, portraying a different contestant being interviewed by the congressional investigator Dick Goodwin, played by Rob Morrow. When &quot;Quiz Show&quot; was released, in spite of being &quot;a little miffed by the portrayal&quot;, which he thought was &quot;an over-the-top sort of portrayal of me&quot;, Stempel embraced the renewed public interest in him, giving interviews on radio and television (notably appearing on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, taped in the same NBC studio &quot;Twenty-One&quot; once occupied), as well as lecturing at some colleges about the quiz scandals.

In 2008, Charles Van Doren broke his long silence, and in an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described the overtures Robert Redford&#x27;s production company made to him to cooperate with the filming of &quot;Quiz Show&quot;. He claimed that Barry &amp; Enright Productions staffer Albert Freedman was actually responsible for scripting the entire Stempel–Van Doren competition, and rejected the image of Stempel as a penurious CCNY student:

In fact, he was a Marines [Stempel was actually in the U.S. Army] veteran married to a woman of some means who once appeared on the set wearing a Persian-lamb coat and was quickly spirited away so that she wouldn&#x27;t blow his cover.

Van Doren wrote that until he viewed WGBH&#x27;s American Experience documentary &quot;The Quiz Show Scandals&quot; he was ignorant of the fact that the show had once been honest—at least for one episode—and that: &quot;Herb Stempel was the first to agree to the fix&quot;.

This latter remark is debatable. Dan Enright has stated that due to the sponsor&#x27;s displeasure he began to rig the show immediately after the premiere episode debuted on September 12, 1956. Whether the contestants in the five weeks before Stempel&#x27;s choreographed October 17 appearance unwittingly received the answers in &quot;practice sessions&quot; the way Richard Jackman described, or were openly coached the same way Stempel was, is unclear. According to Jackman, an earlier contestant than Stempel, Enright was extremely nervous before his appearance on the show and stated, to Jackman&#x27;s bewilderment: &quot;You are in a position to destroy my career.&quot; After Jackman, a struggling author, told Enright he could not continue on a rigged show, Enright tried various types of persuasion and offers of money to persuade him to change his mind. Jackman finally accepted a check for $15,000, and for continuity&#x27;s sake promised to appear again so he could publicly choose to take his &quot;winnings&quot; and depart at the beginning of the show. Kent Anderson portrays Enright as someone who would make certain his next contestant would cooperate. Enright is described as deliberately targeting Stempel&#x27;s emotions, as he did with other contestants, leaving no angle overlooked when trying to gain their full participation.

Stempel died April 7, 2020, almost exactly one year after the death of his rival Charles Van Doren, and at the same age. His death was not publicly announced until nearly two months later.

<text>Philippa Clare Ryan Forrester (born 20 September 1968) is a British television and radio presenter, producer and author.

Forrester has presented shows including CBBC, &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;, Crufts, &quot;The Heaven and Earth Show&quot; and &quot;Robot Wars&quot;.

In 2015, Forrester moved with her family to Wyoming, US to support her husband&#x27;s work with &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine.

==Education==
Forrester was educated at Westgate School, a co-educational comprehensive school in Winchester, Hampshire, and at Peter Symonds College in the same city. She holds a degree in English from the University of Birmingham, where she appeared on the internal Students Guild television station.

==Broadcasting career==
Forrester first worked as a children&#x27;s presenter for BFBS television in 1986, and was often seen reading out birthday cards onscreen. She became a presenter on Children&#x27;s BBC from the early 1990s, becoming a more regular fixture alongside Toby Anstis from July 1990 until 1994. She then hosted many programmes including &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;Barking Mad&quot;, &quot;The Heaven and Earth Show&quot; and &quot;Robot Wars&quot; series 1–3, 5, and 6 before being replaced by Jayne Middlemiss for series 7.

She also co-presented the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the solar eclipse of August 1999. At the end of the same year, she was also part of the corporation&#x27;s team covering the turn of the new millennium, and was duped into appearing on the spoof documentary &quot;Brass Eye&quot;″s 2001 paedophilia special, in which she wore a large pair of gloves, and explained how a paedophile could use them to touch children through a screen, such as a television screen.

She was a co-presenter with Brett Westwood on &quot;World on the Move&quot;, a BBC Radio 4 series that started in 2008 on migration in the animal kingdom.

In September 2013, she co-presented the BBC show &quot;Harvest&quot;, which followed the progress of Britain&#x27;s vegetable, cereal and fruit harvests.

As of January 2022, she was presenting a YouTube series about switching to an electric car sponsored by Hendy.

==TV production==
Forrester&#x27;s first collaboration with her husband was &quot;My Halcyon River&quot;. Following its success, in 2003 they set up a production company, Halcyon Media, which specialises in wildlife productions. In 2007, they co-produced &quot;An Otter in the Family&quot;, a short documentary series about the adoption of an otter cub called Grace and their attempts to raise her as a wild animal in order to be released into the wild. 

Forrester and her husband also produced the four-part &quot;Halcyon River Diaries&quot;, the first episode of which was broadcast in May 2010 on BBC1. The series follows the wildlife found near their home. An additional episode was shown at Christmas 2010.

==Personal life==
Forrester married wildlife cameraman and producer Charlie Hamilton James in July 2004. 
She is an environmentalist. She took a part-time degree in Ecology and Conservation at Birkbeck, University of London while presenting &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World.&quot;

<doc id="511744" wikidata="Q312689" url="?curid=511744" title="Nabis of Sparta">
<text>Nabis () was the last king of independent Sparta. He was probably a member of the Heracleidae, and he ruled from 207 BC to 192 BC, during the years of the First and Second Macedonian Wars and the &quot;War against Nabis&quot; named for being against him. After taking the throne by executing two claimants, he began rebuilding Sparta&#x27;s power. During the Second Macedonian War, Nabis sided with King Philip V of Macedon and in return he received the city of Argos. However, when the war began to turn against the Macedonians, he defected to Rome. After the war, the Romans, urged by the Achaean League, attacked Nabis and defeated him. He then was assassinated in 192 BC by the Aetolian League. He represented the last phase of Sparta&#x27;s reformist period.

== Sources ==
Nabis is cited by many ancient authors: Livy, Plutarch, Pausanias, Diodorus of Sicily, Justin, Eutropius and Zonaras. However, they ultimately all derive from Polybius of Megalopolis, a Greek historian of the 2nd century BC, who mostly lived as a hostage in Rome, where he composed &quot;The Histories&quot; in 40 books, now partially lost. Polybius is treated as a historian whose takes are balanced, however his account is viewed by scholars as biased because he deeply hated Sparta and Nabis. Firstly, his home city of Megalopolis was besieged by Sparta several times and even destroyed by the Spartan king Cleomenes III in 223. Secondly, Polybius&#x27; father Lycortas was one of the leaders of the Achaean League, the hereditary enemy of Sparta during these years. Polybius was also a conservative politician, and Nabis&#x27; social program of land redistribution and mass manumissions revolted him. Finally, during his Roman captivity, Polybius befriended several prominent Roman statesmen and came to support Rome against its enemies, among whom was Nabis. Since every ancient author reproduced Polybius, Nabis is universally described in ancient sources as a tyrant of the worst kind, bloodthirsty and sacrilegious. The myth of Nabis&#x27; iron maiden came from Polybius as well, while it is dismissed by modern scholars; Paul Cartledge describes it as a &quot;overheated fantasy&quot;.

Apart from the literary evidence, a few epigraphical sources give some information on Nabis and his reign, as well as his coinage and several inscriptions found in Sparta.

== Family background ==
Ancient sources are silent on the origins of Nabis, which led to a wealth of theories, describing him as either a former helot, a mercenary, a perioecus, an impoverished Spartiate, or an aristocrat. An inscription found in Delos at the end of the 19th century AD citing &quot;Nabis, son of Demaratos&quot; led the epigraphist Théophile Homolle to conclude that Nabis was a descendant of the Eurypontid Spartan king Demaratos (r. c.515–491), who had been forced into exile by the other king, the Agiad Cleomenes I c. 491. The former king settled in Asia, where his descent can episodically be tracked down to the third century, when the family returned to Sparta.

Nabis was born c.250–45. As a member of the Eurypontid dynasty, the young Nabis must have cooperated with the Agiad king Cleomenes III to survive his reign (235–222), since Cleomenes repeatedly murdered or exiled his opponents.

The name of Nabis is peculiar and the only occurrence among Spartan names. It is possibly the Greek version of the Hebraic word &quot;nabi&quot;, which means prophet. Jean-Georges Texier suggests that Nabis is an additional name that he received at the contact of Jews in Egypt, where he might have fled alongside Cleomenes III after his defeat at Sellasia in 222.

In 225, Cleomenes III seized the city of Argos, thanks to the connivance of its tyrant Aristomachos II. It is probably at this time that Nabis married Aristomachos&#x27; niece Apia, in a move to seal the alliance between the two cities. Nabis and Apia had at least two sons and one daughter, of whom only their son Armenas is known by name.

==Reign==

=== Hellenistic king ===
After the defeat of Cleomenes III at Sellasia in 222, it took three years for Sparta to appoint two new kings: the Eurypontid Lycurgus and the Agiad Agesipolis III, who was a minor. In 217, Lycurgus forced the boy Agesipolis to go into exile and reigned alone. Lycurgus died at some point before 209, and was succeeded by his son Pelops, but as he was also a minor, a regent named Machanidas might have acted in his name. Machanidas was however defeated by the Achaean League at the battle of Mantinea in 207, during which he was slain by the Achaean leader Philopoemen.

Nabis took power after the death of Machanidas. Diodorus of Sicily claims that he murdered Pelops, but it is more likely that he was already dead by that time; perhaps he confused Nabis with Machanidas. It seems that Nabis&#x27; accession was unopposed. He assumed the title of king (&quot;basileus&quot;) as mentioned on his coins and on some roof tiles found in Sparta. While Cleomenes had retained the appearance of the traditional Spartan constitution, Nabis got rid of all its elements (the Gerousia, ecclesia, ephors, and dyarchy) and ruled as an absolute monarch, akin to the other Hellenistic kings. He maintained a pomp that had hitherto been alien to Spartans, by living in a palace, keeping a stable of parade horses, and perhaps dressing with a purple mantle. Nabis also had a permanent bodyguard of mercenaries around him. 

Areus had minted coins with his name, but not his portrait; Cleomenes had done the contrary. Nabis was the first Spartan king to mint coins with both his portrait and his name. The reverse of his tetradrachms features a seated Heracles—from whom the Spartan kings claimed descent—perhaps copied from a coin of the Seleucid king Antiochus I struck in Sardis, or from a statue made by Eutychides of Sikyon during the reign of Areus.

=== Building program and economic reforms ===

During the Classical era, Sparta was famous for not having any wall, but that changed after it became a secondary power. Its first defensive structures date from c.315, but they were mostly palisades. Nabis instead built Sparta&#x27;s first full fortifications, with stone and brick walls, which enclosed a very large area of about 200 hectares. These walls completed the urbanisation of Sparta, which had remained somewhat unfinished as it was composed of five villages that never fully merged. The roof tiles were stamped with Nabis&#x27; name to prevent their theft. An inscription dated from c.200 also mentions a water-commissioner, whose role was likely to make reserves in case of a siege.

Nabis&#x27; most controversial part of his reforms was the enfranchisement of slaves, a measure that has been debated by ancient and modern scholars alike. Cleomenes III had already made a mass manumission of 6,000 helots in 222, but it was a desperate action when facing a massive army from Macedonia just before the battle of Sellasia. The evidence is slim, but it seems that Nabis freed many helots as soon as he got into power. However, he might have only freed the helots living on the land of his exiled enemies, as it seems that there were still some helots in Laconia after his reign, and did not enfranchise traditional chattel slaves. He then married some of his freedmen to the wives and daughters of the proscribed, as Spartan women often held vast amount of land. The perioeci, the second-tier citizens of Sparta, were equally rewarded with citizenship.

==Foreign policy==

In foreign policy, Nabis pursued much the same policy as his predecessors: opposing the Achaean League and Macedonia by allying himself with the Aetolians, Elis, and Messene. This led him into an alliance with Rome during the First Macedonian War, signing a peace treaty with Rome in 205 at the Peace of Phoenice.

In the following years Nabis expanded Spartan power, reconquering much of Laconia and Messene. In 204 BC, he opened raids on Megalopolis, which did not break out into war until 202. He also re-established a fleet (apparently with the help of Cretan allies, whom Polybius describes as &quot;pirates&quot;), and used it to re-establish control of the Laconian coastline. He also fortified the city of Sparta for the first time (previously, the Spartans had viewed their city&#x27;s defence as depending on the bravery of their hoplites).

In 201 BC, he invaded the territory of Messene, which had been an ally of Sparta in the previous decades, apparently an attempt to re-establish the control which Sparta had had over the region until the mid 4th century BC. Messene fell to Nabis, but the Spartans were forced to retreat when the army of Philopoemen intervened. Nabis&#x27; forces were decisively defeated at Tegea and he was forced to check his expansionist ambitions for the time.

Nabis&#x27; territorial ambitions brought him into conflict with the Achaean League, which controlled the northern half of the Peloponnese. Although repeatedly defeated by the gifted Achaean strategos Philopoemen, he nevertheless remained a serious threat to the Achaeans, who were considerably less successful against him when led by less competent generals. In 200 BC, alarmed at the ease with which he was ravaging their territory, the Achaeans asked the Macedonian King Philip V for help, which he did not provide. In the following years, Nabis was able to skilfully exploit the conflict between Philip and the Romans, gaining control of the important city of Argos as the price of his alliance with the Macedonians, and then defecting to the soon to be victorious Romans so that he might hold on to his conquest.

==War with Rome==
In 195 BC, however, the Roman proconsul Titus Quinctius Flamininus was persuaded by the Achaeans that the power of Nabis in the Peloponnese needed to be checked. Flamininus ordered Nabis to give Argos back to the Achaeans, or face war with Rome. When Nabis refused, citing the Roman acceptance of his friendship at a time when he had already been in possession of the city as justification, Flamininus invaded Laconia. After an inconclusive campaign the Spartans were defeated, and Nabis was forced to surrender both Argos and the port of Gytheum, which gave him access to the sea.

==Recovery and death==

Though the territory under his control now consisted only of the city of Sparta and its immediate environs, Nabis still hoped to regain his former power. In 192 BC, seeing that the Romans and their Achaean allies were distracted by the imminent war with King Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire and the Aetolian League, Nabis attempted to recapture Gytheum and the Laconian coastline. Initially, he was successful, capturing the port and defeating the Achaean League in a minor naval battle.

Soon after, however, his army was routed by Philopoemen and shut up within the walls of Sparta. After ravaging the surrounding countryside Philopoemen returned home. Within a few months Nabis appealed to the Aetolian League to send troops so that he might protect his territory against the Romans and the Achaean League.

The Aetolians responded by sending an army of 1,000 infantry and 300 cavalry to Sparta. Once there, however, the Aetolians betrayed the tyrant – assassinating him while he was drilling his army outside the city. The Aetolians then attempted to take control of the city but were prevented from doing so by an uprising of the citizens.

The Achaeans, seeking to take advantage of the ensuing chaos, dispatched Philopoemen to Sparta with a large army. Once there he compelled the Spartans to join the Achaean League. Nabis had thus been the last leader of an independent Sparta, and the last ruler under whom the Spartans had been a major power in Greece.

<text>USS &quot;Meredith&quot; (DD-890), a , was the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the United States Marine Corps Sergeant Jonathan Meredith, who saved the life of Lieutenant John Trippe of &quot;Vixen&quot;, during the Barbary Wars. The destroyer was laid down at the Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas, on 27 January 1945; launched on 28 June 1945, sponsored by Miss Juliette S. Kopper, great-great-great-grandniece of Sergeant Meredith; and commissioned on 31 December 1945.

==Service history==
===1946–1952===
Following sea trials and shakedown exercises in the spring of 1946, &quot;Meredith&quot; was employed, for a brief period, in training submarine officers at New London, Connecticut, before steaming south to serve as plane guard for the aircraft carrier during the 1946 midshipmen summer cruise. In the late fall, she pointed her bow northward for operations off Newfoundland and Greenland. Remaining in the western Atlantic Ocean the following year, she cruised from Maine to the Caribbean, participating once again in a midshipmen training cruise. The first part of 1948 was spent in conducting experimental tests for the Operational Development Force, after which, in May, she sailed, with other ships of her squadron, Destroyer Squadron 6, for her first overseas deployment. From that time, until 1953, she got underway in the spring of each year for the Mediterranean and duty with the 6th Fleet. Her 2nd Fleet employment for the same period included Arctic maneuvers (November 1949) and several Caribbean cruises, as well as training cruises with reservists and another midshipmen summer cruise (1952).

===1953–1979===
On 7 January 1953, &quot;Meredith&quot; entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for habitability conversion which lasted into November. She then resumed the alternation of duty tours with the 2nd and 6th Fleets. During her 1958 overseas deployment, she served briefly with the Middle East Force as she and stood by in the Euphrates delta area after the Iraqi revolution of 14 July.

Toward the end of the following year, &quot;Meredith&quot;, reassigned to DesRon 14, was slated for FRAM (Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization). Entering the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, on 28 June 1960, she remained for a year and two days during which time her bridge was enclosed, her torpedo deck was modified to allow the installation of ASROC, and her seven-year-old 3 inch battery was replaced by a helicopter hangar and flight deck to accommodate the QH-50 DASH (Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter) weapons system.

On 1 July 1961, the &quot;new&quot; &quot;Meredith&quot; sailed for her new home port, Mayport, Florida. After refresher training, she got underway for a good will tour of various ports in the Caribbean and along the west coast of Africa from Freetown, Sierra Leone, to Cape Town, Republic of South Africa. While en route she collected oceanographic data which included piscatorial and avian surveys as well as hydrologic information. &quot;Meredith&quot; returned to Mayport on 18 February 1962. She further tested and evaluated the ASROC system before heading north to embark midshipmen for the fourth time. In August 1958, the destroyer once again transited the Atlantic for oversea deployment. In November 1965, brought her into the space age with an assignment to the Project Gemini recovery operations.

===1965–1979===
&quot;1969&quot; In the early part of the year Meredith passed through the Panama canal en route to the western pacific where she participated in the Action in the South China Sea providing coastal bombardment and plane guard service. Meredith operated in the combat zone over a six-month period.

During the WestPac tour, while en route to Australia (but short of crossing the equator) Meredith was reassigned to join what was said to be the largest task force of American war ships since World War II. The task force was assembled in response to North Korea&#x27;s downing of an American aircraft. Meredith returned to Mayport in the latter part 1969.

Subsequent to the WestPac tour of 1969 Meredith once again sailed to join the United States 6th Fleet for service in the Mediterranean, after which she returned her Mayport, Fla. home port.

&quot;Meredith&quot; was decommissioned on 29 June 1979 and transferred to Turkey on the same day. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 7 December 1979.

In Turkish Navy service, she was renamed TCG &quot;Savaştepe&quot; (D 348). The ship was scrapped in 1995.

<text>The Santa Fe Institute (SFI) is an independent, nonprofit theoretical research institute located in Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States and dedicated to the multidisciplinary study of the fundamental principles of complex adaptive systems, including physical, computational, biological, and social systems. The institute is ranked 24th among the world&#x27;s &quot;Top Science and Technology Think Tanks&quot; and 24th among the world&#x27;s &quot;Best Transdisciplinary Research Think Tanks&quot; according to the 2020 edition of the &quot;Global Go To Think Tank Index Reports&quot;, published annually by the University of Pennsylvania.

The institute consists of a small number of resident faculty and postdoctoral researchers, a large group of external faculty whose primary appointments are at other institutions, and a number of visiting scholars. The institute is advised by a group of eminent scholars, including several Nobel Prize-winning scientists. Although theoretical scientific research is the institute&#x27;s primary focus, it also runs several popular summer schools on complex systems, along with other educational and outreach programs aimed at students ranging from middle school up through graduate school.

The institute&#x27;s annual funding comes from a combination of private donors, grant-making foundations, government science agencies, and companies affiliated with its business network. The 2014 budget was just over $10 million. Evolutionary theorist David Krakauer became the institute&#x27;s president on August 1, 2015.

== History ==
The Santa Fe Institute was founded in 1984 by scientists George Cowan, David Pines, Stirling Colgate, Murray Gell-Mann, Nick Metropolis, Herb Anderson, Peter A. Carruthers, and Richard Slansky. All but Pines and Gell-Mann were scientists with Los Alamos National Laboratory. Originally called the &quot;Rio Grande Institute&quot;, the scientists sought a forum to conduct theoretical research outside the traditional disciplinary boundaries of academic departments and government agency science budgets.

SFI&#x27;s original mission was to disseminate the notion of a new interdisciplinary research area called complexity theory or simply complex systems. This new effort was intended to provide an alternative to the increasing specialization the founders observed in science by focusing on synthesis across disciplines. As the idea of interdisciplinary science increased in popularity, a number of independent institutes and departments emerged whose focus emphasized similar goals.

The Santa Fe Institute was created to be a visiting institution, with no permanent or tenured positions, a small group of resident faculty and postdoctoral researchers, a large visitors program, and a larger group of external faculty affiliated with the institute but located at other institutions. The motivation of this structure was to encourage active turnover in ideas and people, allowing the research to remain on the cutting edge of interdisciplinary science. Today, the Santa Fe Institute continues to follow this organizational model.

== Organization ==
The institute is composed of several distinct groups. The resident faculty are researchers whose primary appointment is at the institute. Along with the Omidyar Fellows, a group of postdoctoral scholars in residence, the resident faculty makes up the majority of the researchers physically present at the institute. The external faculty is a group of roughly 100 affiliated researchers whose primary appointments are at other institutions, typically universities. These individuals form a large and distributed community of scholars who frequently visit the Institute and contribute to its overall research program. The institute&#x27;s Applied Complexity Network, formerly the Business Network, is a group of private companies and government agencies interested in complex systems research. Members of the business network often send representatives to Institute meetings or to serve as research fellows in residence at the institute. The institute&#x27;s Science Board is a large group of eminent scholars who advise the institute on important strategic matters. This group includes a number of Nobel Prize winners.

The institute is headed by a president, currently evolutionary theorist David Krakauer, and a vice president for science, currently network ecologist Jennifer Dunne. It is governed by a Board of Trustees, which is chaired by Katherine Collins of Putnam Investments.

== Research ==
Research at the institute focuses on systems commonly described as complex adaptive systems or simply complex systems. Recent research has included studies of evolutionary computation, metabolic and ecological scaling laws, the fundamental properties of cities, the evolutionary diversification of viral strains, the interactions and conflicts of primate social groups, the history of languages, the structure and dynamics of species interactions including food webs, the dynamics of financial markets, and the emergence of hierarchy and cooperation in the human species, and biological and technological innovation.

Historically, researchers affiliated with the institute played roles to varying degrees in the development and use of methods for studying complex systems, including agent-based modeling, network theory, computational immunology, the physics of financial markets, genetic algorithms, the physics of computation, and machine learning.

The institute also studies foundational topics in the physics and mathematics of complex systems, using tools from related disciplines such as information theory, combinatorics, computational complexity theory and condensed matter physics. Recent research in this area has included studies of phase transitions in NP-hard problems.

Some of the institute&#x27;s accomplishments include:
* Complexity research which led to efforts to create artificial life modeling real organisms and ecosystems in the 1980s and 1990s.
* Foundational contributions to the field of chaos theory.
* Foundational contributions to the field of genetic algorithms.
* Foundational contributions to the complexity economics school of thought.
* Foundational contributions to the field of econophysics.
* Foundational contributions to the field of complex networks.
* Foundational contributions to the field of systems biology.
* The &quot;Evolution of Human Languages&quot; project, an attempt to trace all human language to a common ancestor (Proto-Human language).
* The &quot;Maya Working Group&quot; which has investigated the origins and development of complexity for the Maya civilization.
* The &quot;Cities, scaling, &amp; sustainability&quot; project to understand cities from a quantitative and interdisciplinary approach (urban scaling).

== Educational programs ==
The Santa Fe Institute runs a number of education programs aimed at introducing students as young as middle school and as old as graduate school to the core ideas of complex systems. The longest running education program is the annual Complex Systems Summer School. The CSSS hosts 50–60 graduate students and early postdocs, along with select Business Network fellows, for a four-week course on complex systems. Lectures are provided by Institute researchers, and students work on a small collaborative project on complex systems.

The institute also awards an annual High School Prize for Scientific Excellence to a local high school student and a local teacher.

The educational programs include:
* Complex Systems Summer School (graduate and postdoctoral level)
* Graduate Workshop in Computational Social Science (graduate level)
* Global Sustainability Summer School (graduate level)
* Research Experiences for Undergraduates (undergraduate level)

Since the 1980s, the Santa Fe Institute has held a series of public lectures, which generally take place at the Lensic Center in downtown Santa Fe. Typically 5–6 talks are held each year, normally by visiting external faculty of the institute. Attendance at these lectures is free of charge, and in recent years many of the talks are recorded and made available on video platforms such as YouTube

The Santa Fe Institute has also launched a series of massive open online courses on complex systems, the first of which began in early 2013.

In October 2019, The Santa Fe Institute launched Complexity Podcast, a general-audience weekly science discussion program featuring long-form interviews with SFI researchers.

<doc id="511753" wikidata="Q235409" url="?curid=511753" title="Petronilla of Aragon">
<text>Petronilla (29 June/11 August 1136 – 15 October 1173), whose name is also spelled Petronila or Petronella (Aragonese: &quot;Peyronela&quot; or &quot;Payronella&quot;, and ), was Queen of Aragon (1137–1164) from the abdication of her father, Ramiro II, in 1137 until her own abdication in 1164. After her abdication she acted as regent during the minority of her son Alfonso II of Aragon (1164–1173). She was the last ruling member of the Jiménez dynasty in the Kingdom of Aragon, and by marriage to Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona brought the House of Barcelona to the throne of Aragon, uniting the Kingdom of Aragon with the County of Barcelona to create the Crown of Aragon.

==Early life==
Born in August 1136, Petronilla was the daughter of Ramiro II of Aragon and Agnes of Aquitaine. She came to the throne through special circumstances. Her father, Ramiro, was bishop of Barbastro-Roda when his brother, Alfonso I, died childless in 1134. Alfonso left the kingdom to the Knights Templar, the Hospitallers, and the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre, but his decision was not respected. The aristocracy of Navarre elected a king of their own, restoring their independence, and the nobility of Aragon raised Ramiro to the throne. Pope Innocent II rejected this election, seeking to affirm Alfonso I&#x27;s final will. Despite the lack of papal approval, King Ramiro the Monk, as he is known, married Agnes of Aquitaine in 1135.

Petronilla&#x27;s marriage was a very important matter of state. The nobility had rejected the proposition of Alfonso VII of Castile to arrange a marriage between Petronilla and his son Sancho and to educate her at his court. When she was just a little over one year old, Petronilla was betrothed in Barbastro on 11 August 1137 to Raymond Berengar IV, Count of Barcelona, who was twenty-three years her senior.

==Queen regnant==
At El Castellar on 13 November 1137, Ramiro abdicated, transferred authority to Ramon Berenguer, and returned to monastic life. Ramon Berenger de facto ruled the kingdom using the title of &quot;Prince of the Aragonese&quot; (&quot;princeps Aragonensis&quot;).

In August 1150, when Petronilla was fourteen, the betrothal was ratified at a wedding ceremony held in the city of Lleida. Petronilla consummated her marriage to Ramon Berenguer in the early part of 1151, when she reached the age of 15. The marriage produced five children: Peter (1152–57), Raymond Berengar (1157–96), Peter (1158–81), Dulce (1160–98), and Sancho (1161–1223). While she was pregnant with the first, on 4 April 1152, she wrote up a will bequeathing her kingdom to her husband in case she did not survive childbirth. Even before the death of her father Ramiro II, Petronilla was using the title Queen of Aragon in her will, written in 1152.

While her husband was away in Provence (1156–57), where he was regent (since 1144) for the young Count Raymond Berengar II, Queen Petronilla remained in Barcelona. Accounting records show her moving between there and Vilamajor and Sant Celoni while presiding over the court in Raymond Berengar&#x27;s absence.

After her husband&#x27;s death in 1162, Petronilla received the prosperous County of Besalú and the Vall de Ribes for life. As a widow, she was the only ruler of Aragon for the next two years.

==Regent==
Even after the death of her husband Ramon Berenguer IV, the titles of Petronilla were Queen of Aragon and Countess of Barcelona in the document about her abdication in 1164. Her eldest son was seven years old when, on 18 June 1164 (&quot;Actum est hoc in Barchinona XIIII kalendas julii anno Dominice incarnationis M C LXIIII&quot;), Petronilla abdicated the throne of Aragon and passed it to him. When Raymond Berenguer inherited the throne from his mother, he changed his name to Alfonso out of deference to the Aragonese. The second son, named Peter, then changed his name to Raymond Berenguer. Her son and heir was only seven years old when she abdicated in his favor, and so she continued to rule after her abdication, this time acting as his regent during his minority.

Petronilla died in Barcelona in October 1173 and was buried at Barcelona Cathedral; her tomb has been lost. After her death, Besalú and Vall de Ribes reverted to the direct domain of the count of Barcelona, her son Alfonso, who by 1174 had bestowed Besalú on his wife, Sancha. In the Ribes, the local bailiff, Ramon, had carved out for himself &quot;a virtually independent administrative authority&quot; there. He had conducted an inventory for Petronilla after Raymond Berenguer&#x27;s death, and his son and namesake was in power in 1198.

==Legacy==
In 1410, after the death of King Martin without living legitimate descendants, the House of Barcelona became extinct in the legitimate male line. Two years later, Ferdinand I was enthroned per the Compromise of Caspe. Although Ferdinand triumphed mainly for political and military reasons, the theoretical basis of his candidacy was inheritance in the female line, for which Queen Petronilla served as the precedent. He was Martin&#x27;s closest legitimate male relative, but related through a woman. His chief opponent, Count James II of Urgell, was related to Martin more distantly, but in the male line. In Catalonia there were indications that women were forbidden to hold comital office, but in Aragon there was no legislation on the subject. In both places there were a few cases of women who had passed on their right to their sons, most importantly Petronilla.

There is a long debate whether Petronilla was the true ruler of Aragon. Some claim that Ramiro II gave the kingdom of Aragon to his son-in-law and that the presence of Petronilla was secondary. According to Jerónimo de Zurita, there was a clause in the pact with Ramon Berenguer stating that if Petronilla died, Aragon would pass to the children of Ramon Berenguer through a future second marriage. In any case, there is insufficient documentation to make a completely conclusive statement about the question and the Compromise of Caspe confirmed the legitimacy of female transmission.

==Commemoration==
The Spanish Navy screw frigate , in commission from 1858 to 1863, was named for Petronilla of Aragon.

<doc id="511760" wikidata="Q1427733" url="?curid=511760" title="Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization">
<text>The Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) program of the United States Navy extended the lives of World War II-era destroyers by shifting their mission from a surface attack role to that of a submarine hunter. The FRAM program also covered cruisers, aircraft carriers, submarines, amphibious ships, and auxiliaries. The United States Coast Guard also used this term in the 1980s for the modernization of its s.

==Background==
The program was started by Admiral Arleigh Burke as a response to estimates that the Soviet Navy would have a force of about 300 modern fast-attack submarines by 1957. The U.S. Navy was unable to produce quickly enough the destroyer escorts (redesignated as frigates after 1975) and other antisubmarine warfare ships to counter this threat, given its other priorities in new antiaircraft warfare frigates (redesignated as cruisers after 1975) and aircraft carriers, so Admiral Burke instead looked for ways to modify the existing World War II destroyer, which were rapidly becoming outdated anyway.

Burke oversaw preparation of a report to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees entitled &quot;The Aging Fleet.&quot; The idea that became FRAM was only one of six recommendations of a special committee to address the poor material conditions of ships built during World War II. Those recommendations were, in order of preference: 
#Build new ships, 
#Give more time to maintenance, 
#Accomplish more extensive overhauls, 
#Provide more money for maintenance, 
#Institute better training for maintenance personnel, or 
#Create a large-scale modernization and rehabilitation program to fill the gap until new ships can be built. 
United States Secretary of the Navy Thomas S. Gates embraced the last recommendation in a meeting with United States Secretary of Defense Neil Hosler McElroy on 11 November 1958.

A comparable program for the Royal Navy had provided modifications to 33 British War Emergency Programme destroyers, which were converted during 1949–1956 into 23 Type 15 first-rate antisubmarine warfare frigates and 10 Type 16 limited conversions, pending the construction of new Type 12 and Type 14 frigates.

==FRAM destroyers==

Among the destroyers, conversion of the and classes took precedence over the and classes. Destroyer conversions relied on experience with &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyers modernized for transfer to Spain and Germany in 1957. The first two destroyers began FRAM in Boston, Massachusetts and Long Beach, California shipyards in March 1959.

In Navy slang, the modified destroyers were called &quot;FRAM cans&quot;, &quot;can&quot; being a contraction of &quot;tin can&quot;, the slang term for a destroyer or smaller destroyer escort.

In order to provide the ships with a credible antisubmarine weapon, the FRAM I upgrade for the &quot;Gearing&quot; class centered on the addition of AN/SQS-23 sonar and two new weapon systems, the ASROC rocket-assisted torpedo launcher with a range of one to five miles (not in FRAM II upgrades), and the DASH antisubmarine helicopter with a range of up to . Both were armed with the new Mark 44 torpedo, which was also carried in the torpedo tubes of the 
warships. The ASROC could also launch a nuclear depth charge.

There were three different sets of FRAM upgrades. During refitting in the early 1950s, FRAM I &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyers gave up the No. 2, 3 and 4 5-inch/38 caliber gun mounts, leaving only the two mounts on the main deck. A trainable Mark 15 Hedgehog mount took the place of the No. 2 gun mount, connected to a new, enlarged sonar suite. All topside torpedo tubes were removed and replaced with two tubes mounted in the after deckhouse. One twin 3-inch/50 caliber gun mount was placed aft, atop the after deckhouse. There were variations such as , which had the 5-inch/38 mounts 3 and 4 removed in exchange for two twin 3-inch/50 caliber gun mounts above the after deckhouse connected to a computer controlled aft director. FRAM II changes saw the replacement of the Hedgehog mount with a Mark 108 Weapon Alpha ASW rocket launcher, the addition of two new triple Mark 32 torpedo tubes for the Mk.44 torpedo and the removal of the 3 in guns for the DASH hangar and flight deck. The only &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyers to receive the FRAM II upgrade were , and .
Ships from the &quot;Gearing&quot; class were completely torn down and rebuilt from the hull up, including new engines, a much larger combat information center, and new sonar and radar systems. The 21-inch torpedo tubes between the funnels were removed, and the 8-round ASROC launcher (FRAM I only) placed there instead. All 3-inch/50 cal gun mounts were removed, and the after superstructure was used for the DASH&#x27;s hangar and flight deck, with two new triple Mark 32 torpedo tubes for the 12.75-inch Mk.44 torpedo placed just behind the rear funnel. This modernization was designed to extend the life of the destroyer by at least eight years. Eventually, all but three &quot;Gearing&quot;s received FRAM I or FRAM II conversions.

==FRAM II==

Ships in the &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot; class received only armament modifications under FRAM II, and not all ships of the class received the FRAM upgrades. Although the rear deck was also converted as a flight deck for the DASH, the new 12.75-inch triple torpedo tubes were placed where the older 21-inch ones had been, and ASROC was not installed. Typically, all three 5-inch/38 twin mounts were retained. Additionally, two new 21-inch torpedo tubes for the Mark 37 ASW homing torpedo and variable depth sonar (VDS) were added. The converted &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;s were designed for another five years of service. 

Sixteen &quot;Gearing&quot;s were also converted under FRAM II. These included six radar picket destroyers (DDRs) and six escort destroyers (DDEs) that retained their specialized equipment (radar or trainable Hedgehog), as well as four former DDRs that were converted to near-twins of the &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;-class FRAM II destroyers. No &quot;Gearing&quot; FRAM IIs received ASROC. The retained DDRs kept all six 5-inch guns, and photographs show their DASH hangar was smaller than on other ships, plus the landing pad had no markings, so they may not have received the DASH.

All classes came in for FRAM II refits starting about 1959, being rotated out of service in order to keep as many ships at sea as possible. The upgrades were complete by 1965, and most of the ships involved continued to serve actively until the late 1960s.

==FRAM destroyer summary==
A total of 95 &quot;Gearing&quot;s and 33 &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;s received FRAM modifications 1960–1965. Many of the ships provided significant gunfire support in the Vietnam War. DASH was withdrawn from ASW service beginning in 1969 due to poor reliability. Lacking ASROC, the &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;s were left without a standoff ASW capability, and were decommissioned 1970–1973, with most being transferred to foreign navies. The &quot;Gearing&quot;s lasted somewhat longer in US service, with most decommissioned and transferred to foreign navies 1973–1980. The FRAM destroyers were replaced as ASW ships by the s (destroyer escorts prior to 1975), which were commissioned 1969–1974, and the s, which were commissioned 1975–1983. Both of the replacement classes had the same ASW armament as a &quot;Gearing&quot; FRAM I destroyer, with the addition of more and faster ASROC reloads, improved sonar, and a piloted helicopter, typically the Kaman SH-2 Seasprite. 

Some ships of the &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot; (from 1965) and &quot;Gearing&quot; classes (from 1973) served in the Naval Reserve Force (NRF), remaining in commission with a partial active crew to provide training for Naval reservists. The last FRAM destroyer in US naval service was , a &quot;Gearing&quot; FRAM I, decommissioned and stricken 1 October 1983 and expended as a target 14 July 1999.

==FRAM II Carriers==
The s modified for ASW service received the SCB 144 upgrade in 1960–1964 as part of the FRAM II program. They received a bow-mounted AN/SQS-23 sonar, as well as improved displays in the Combat Information Center.

<text>A shadow person (also known as a shadow figure or black mass) is the perception of shadow as a living species, humanoid figure, sometimes interpreted as the presence of a spirit or other entity by believers in the paranormal or supernatural.

==History and folklore==
A number of religions, legends, and belief systems describe supernatural entities such as shades of the underworld, and various shadowy creatures have long been a staple of folklore and ghost stories, such as the Islamic Jinn and the Choctaw Nalusa Chito.

The &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; late night radio talk show helped popularize modern beliefs in shadow people. The first time the topic of shadow people was discussed at length on the show was April 12, 2001, when host Art Bell interviewed a man purporting to be a Native American elder, Thunder Strikes, who is also known as Harley &quot;SwiftDeer&quot; Reagan. During the show, listeners were encouraged to submit drawings of shadow people that they had seen and a large number of these drawings were immediately shared publicly on the website.

In October that year, Heidi Hollis published her first book on the topic of shadow people, and later became a regular guest on &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;. Hollis describes shadow people as dark silhouettes with human shapes and profiles that flicker in and out of peripheral vision, and claims that people have reported the figures attempting to &quot;jump on their chest and choke them&quot;. She believes the figures to be negative aliens that can be repelled by various means, including invoking &quot;the Name of Jesus&quot;.

Although participants in online discussion forums devoted to paranormal and supernatural topics describe them as menacing, other believers and paranormal authors do not agree whether shadow people are either evil, helpful, or neutral, and some even speculate that shadow people may be the extra-dimensional inhabitants of another universe. Some paranormal investigators and authors such as Chad Stambaugh claim to have recorded images of shadow people on video.

Shadow people feature in two episodes of ITV paranormal documentary series &quot;Extreme Ghost Stories&quot;, where the phenomenon is described as a &quot;black mass&quot;.

===The &quot;Hat Man&quot;===

One example of a particular shadow person is the &quot;Hat Man&quot;, who shares the characteristics of general shadow people but is named for a fedora or other brimmed hat on his head. Descriptions of the Hat Man date back to as early as the late 2000s. The Hat Man is commonly associated with sleep paralysis and the abuse of the antihistamine medicine diphenhydramine, commonly sold under the brand name Benadryl. He is typically described as having very little or no discernible features, although some witnesses have claimed they can &quot;feel him staring&quot; at them.

==Scientific explanations==
Several physiological and psychological conditions can account for reported experiences of shadowy shapes seeming alive. A sleep paralysis sufferer may perceive a &quot;shadowy or indistinct shape&quot; approaching them when they lie awake paralyzed and become increasingly alarmed.

A person experiencing heightened emotion, such as while walking alone on a dark night, may incorrectly perceive a patch of shadow as an attacker.

Many methamphetamine addicts report the appearance of &quot;shadow people&quot; after prolonged periods of sleep deprivation. Psychiatrist Jack Potts suggests that methamphetamine usage adds a &quot;conspiratorial component&quot; to the sleep deprivation hallucinations. One interviewed subject said that &quot;You don&#x27;t see shadow dogs or shadow birds or shadow cars. You see shadow people. Standing in doorways, walking behind you, coming at you on the sidewalk.&quot; These hallucinations have been directly compared to the paranormal entities described in folklore.

Shadow people are commonly reported by people under the effects of deliriant substances such as datura, diphenhydramine, and benzydamine.

Finally, visual hallucinations, such as those caused by schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, may appear to be shadowy figures at the edge of peripheral vision.

==In popular culture==
*&quot;The Nightmare&quot; is a 2015 documentary that discusses the causes of sleep paralysis as seen through extensive interviews with participants, and the experiences are re-enacted by professional actors. It proposes that such cultural phenomena as alien abduction, the near death experience and shadow people can, in many cases, be attributed to sleep paralysis. The &quot;real-life&quot; horror film debuted at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26 and premiered in theatres on June 5.
* Shadow people, described as &quot;Shadow Men&quot;, feature prominently in the 2007 novel &quot;John Dies at the End&quot;. When they kill a person, that person is retroactively erased from existence, and history is rewritten as though they were never born.
* The 2013 horror film &quot;Shadow People&quot; depicts a fictional sleep study conducted during the 1970s in which patients report seeing shadowy intruders before dying in their sleep. The film follows a radio host and CDC investigator who research the story, and the story is claimed to be based on true events.
* In a 2012 episode of A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;Intervention&quot; series, the subject Skyler is plagued by &quot;shadow people&quot;, sometimes called &quot;phase people&quot;, and sprays a mist to unveil them in the refractions. He also builds weapons to fight them and alleges that they are using stolen technology to telepathically communicate with certain individuals.
* In the online game &quot;Deep Sleep&quot; and its sequels, shadow people have existed since the dawn of the human race and lurk in lucid dreams. Players who realize that they are asleep can be paralyzed and possessed, and the character&#x27;s dream self will be turned into a shadow person.
* An episode of the 1985 &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; series titled &quot;The Shadow Man&quot; dealt with a teenage boy who had a shadow person living under his bed. The episode portrayed the shadow man as fitting the &quot;hat man&quot; appearance commonly ascribed to shadow people and added to the mythology that shadow people can kill humans but will not harm those under whose beds they live.
* In the 1998 video game , a humanoid figure commonly known as the Gray Man may appear in some dreams, who, if touched, undoes all dream progress and erases saved flashback data. The figure, in both appearance and roles in dreams, is similar to that of the &quot;Hat Man&quot; phenomenon.
* The song &quot;The Shadow Man Incident&quot; by the band Dream Theater, from their 2025 album &quot;Parasomnia&quot;, deals with shadow people.

<doc id="511767" wikidata="Q420686" url="?curid=511767" title="Ylide">
<text>An ylide () or ylid () is a neutral dipolar molecule containing a formally negatively charged atom (usually a carbanion) directly attached to a heteroatom with a formal positive charge (usually nitrogen, phosphorus or sulfur), and in which both atoms have full octets of electrons. The result can be viewed as a structure in which two adjacent atoms are connected by both a covalent and an ionic bond; normally written X+–Y−. Ylides are thus 1,2-dipolar compounds, and a subclass of zwitterions. They appear in organic chemistry as reagents or reactive intermediates.

The class name &quot;ylide&quot; for the compound should not be confused with the suffix &quot;-ylide&quot;.

== Resonance structures ==
Many ylides may be depicted by a multiply bonded form in a resonance structure, known as the ylene form, while the actual structure lies in between both forms:
The actual bonding picture of these types of ylides is strictly zwitterionic (the structure on the right) with the strong Coulombic attraction between the &quot;onium&quot; atom and the adjacent carbon accounting for the reduced bond length. Consequently, the carbon anion is trigonal pyramidal.

==Phosphonium ylides==

Phosphonium ylides are used in the Wittig reaction, a method used to convert ketones and especially aldehydes to alkenes. The positive charge in these Wittig reagents is carried by a phosphorus atom with three phenyl substituents and a bond to a carbanion. Ylides can be &#x27;stabilised&#x27; or &#x27;non-stabilised&#x27;. A phosphonium ylide can be prepared rather straightforwardly. Typically, triphenylphosphine is allowed to react with an alkyl halide in a mechanism analogous to that of an SN2 reaction. This quaternization forms an alkyltriphenylphosphonium salt, which can be isolated or treated in situ with a strong base (in this case, butyllithium) to form the ylide.

Due to the SN2 mechanism, a less sterically hindered alkyl halide reacts more favorably with triphenylphosphine than an alkyl halide with significant steric hindrance (such as tert-butyl bromide). Because of this, there will typically be one synthetic route in a synthesis involving such compounds that is more favorable than another.

Phosphorus ylides are important reagents in organic chemistry, especially in the synthesis of naturally occurring products with
biological and pharmacological activities. Much of the interest in the coordination properties of a-keto stabilized phosphorus
ylides stems from their coordination versatility due to the presence of different functional groups in their molecular structure.

==Non-symmetric phosphorus ylides==
The a-keto stabilized ylides derived from bisphosphines like dppe, dppm, etc., viz., [Ph2PCH2PPh2]C(H)C(O)R and [Ph2PCH2CH2PPh2]C(H)C(O)R (R = Me, Ph or OMe) constitute an important class of hybrid ligands containing both phosphine and ylide functionalities, and can exist in ylidic and enolate forms. These ligands can therefore be engaged in different kinds of bonding with metal ions like palladium and platinum.

==Other types==

===Based on sulfur===
Other common ylides include sulfonium ylides and sulfoxonium ylides; for instance, the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent used in the preparation of epoxides or in the Stevens rearrangement.

===Based on oxygen===
Carbonyl ylides (RR&#x27;C=O+C−RR&#x27;) can form by ring-opening of epoxides or by reaction of carbonyls with electrophilic carbenes, which are usually prepared from diazo compounds. Oxonium ylides (RR&#x27;-O+-C−R&#x27;R) are formed by the reaction of ethers with electrophilic carbenes.

===Based on nitrogen===
Certain nitrogen-based ylides also exist such as azomethine ylides with the general structure:

These compounds can be envisioned as iminium cations placed next to a carbanion. The substituents R1, R2 are electron withdrawing groups. These ylides can be generated by condensation of an α-amino acid and an aldehyde or by thermal ring opening reaction of certain N-substituted aziridines. 

The further-unsaturated nitrile ylides are known almost exclusively as unstable intermediates. 

A rather exotic family of dinitrogen-based ylides are the isodiazenes (R1R2N+=N–), which generally decompose by extrusion of dinitrogen.

Stable carbenes also have a ylidic resonance contributor, &quot;e.g.&quot;:

===Other===
Halonium ylides can be prepared from allyl halides and metal carbenoids. After a [2,3]-rearrangement, a homoallylhalide is obtained.

The active form of Tebbe&#x27;s reagent is often considered a titanium ylide. Like the Wittig reagent, it is able to replace the oxygen atom on carbonyl groups with a methylene group. Compared with the Wittig reagent, it has more functional group tolerance.

==Reactions==
An important ylide reaction is of course the Wittig reaction (for phosphorus) but there are more.

===Dipolar cycloadditions===
Some ylides are 1,3-dipoles and interact in 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions. For instance an azomethine ylide is a dipole in the Prato reaction with fullerenes.

===Dehydrocoupling with silanes===
In the presence of the group 3 homoleptic catalyst Y[N(SiMe3)2]3, triphenylphosphonium methylide can be coupled with phenylsilane. This reaction produces H2 gas as a byproduct, and forms a silyl-stabilised ylide.

===Sigmatropic rearrangements===
Many ylides react in sigmatropic reactions. The Sommelet-Hauser rearrangement is an example of a [2,3]-sigmatropic reaction. The Stevens rearrangement is a [1,2]-rearrangement.

A -sigmatropic reaction has been observed in certain phosphonium ylides.

===Allylic rearrangements===
Wittig reagents are found to react as nucleophiles in SN2&#x27; substitution:

The initial addition reaction is followed by an elimination reaction.

<text>USS &quot;Dyess&quot; (DD/DDR-880), a , was a ship of the United States Navy named for Aquilla James Dyess (1909–1944). Dyess was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for his leadership of his battalion of Marines in the Battle of Kwajalein. The ship was laid down by Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas on 17 August 1944, launched on 26 January 1945 and commissioned on 21 May 1945. The vessel spent the majority of her career patrolling the Mediterranean Sea with NATO forces. The ship was decommissioned on 27 January 1981 and sold to Greece the same year for spare parts.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Dyess&quot; was laid down by the Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas on 17 August 1944, launched on 26 January 1945 by Mrs. A. J. Dyess, widow of Lieutenant Colonel Dyess and commissioned on 21 May 1945. After her shakedown cruise and conversion to a radar picket destroyer, &quot;Dyess&quot; sailed from Norfolk 7 November 1945 to join the 5th Fleet at Tokyo Bay 19 December for occupation duty in the Far East. She returned to San Diego on 16 December 1946, and on 6 January 1947, got underway for the east coast, arriving at Norfolk 23 January. She served in local training cruises until August of that year when she sailed to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to escort President Harry S. Truman, embarked in the battleship as far as Norfolk, where he transferred to the presidential yacht which &quot;Dyess&quot; escorted to Washington, D.C.

&quot;Dyess&quot; arrived at Newport, Rhode Island, on 27 September 1947 for local training operations. After a tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean from 29 October to 14 February 1948, she returned to her home port of Norfolk. She was reclassified DDR-880 18 March 1949. Until the end of 1958 &quot;Dyess&quot; made nine tours of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean, patrolling to preserve peace and engaging in exercises with NATO forces. She also sailed on two midshipman cruises, one to southern Europe in the summer of 1948 and one to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in the summer of 1951.

The remainder of her service was as varied as her capabilities. She acted as plane guard during the qualifying of pilots in carrier operations and joined in hunter-killer exercises, amphibious training, and large-scale fleet exercises. She assisted in the evacuation of American nationals from Suez during the tense situation which developed during her 1956 Mediterranean cruise. In the summer of 1958 she joined in strengthening the free world&#x27;s defenses with NATO operations in northern Europe. &quot;Dyess&quot; operated along the east coast and off Cuba in 1959, and on 25 July arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, her new home port. On 29 January 1960 she sailed on her tenth deployment to the Mediterranean.

From March to July 1966 &quot;Dyess&quot; conducted a WESTPAC (Western Pacific) deployment which included gunfire support missions in the area around Da Nang and the III Corps area of operations in South Vietnam. &quot;Dyess&quot; returned to Newport in August 1966.
&quot;Dyess&quot; returned to Charleston in August, and in October entered Charleston Naval Shipyard, where she remained until the end of 1960. &quot;Dyess&quot; was in the Brooklyn Naval Yard in the 1970s as a Navy reserve ship. &quot;Dyess&quot; was decommissioned on 27 January 1981, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 27 February 1981, transferred to Greece on 8 July 1981 and cannibalized for spare parts.

<text>USS &quot;Bordelon&quot; (DD/DDR-881) was one of 98 World War II s of the United States Navy, and was named for Marine Staff Sergeant William J. Bordelon (1920–1943), who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism in the Battle of Tarawa.

&quot;Bordelon&quot; was laid down by the Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas on 9 September 1944, launched on 3 March 1945 by Mrs. W. J. Bordelon, the mother of Staff Sergeant Bordelon, and commissioned on 5 June 1945.

==Service history==
&quot;Bordelon&quot; operated as a part of the occupation force in Japan until March 1946, then alternated operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean with the 2nd Fleet with deployments to the Mediterranean with the 6th Fleet.
In October 1962 the Bordelon deployed from its home port of Charleston, SC to the Caribbean to participate in the blockade of Russian ships during the Cuban Crisis.
&quot;Bordelon&quot; assisted in fighting the fire on the cruiser after &quot;Belknap&quot;″s collision with the aircraft carrier on the night of 22 November 1975.

On 14 September 1976, while refueling alongside USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;, the ships came together and collided. &quot;Bordelon&quot;″s port bow and some of the superstructure were damaged and the main mast snapped and fell on the signal shack, injuring some of the handling team.

The ammunition ship was also involved in the rescue of &quot;Bordelon&quot; by escorting her to an ammunition where &quot;Mount Baker&quot;″s explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) team off-loaded her entire cargo of ammunition while providing electric and water services.

Due to the damage to the superstructure and electronics and the age and condition of the hull, &quot;Bordelon&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 February 1977, transferred to Iran in July 1977, and cannibalized for spare parts.

<text>Moses Henry Dodge (October 12, 1782 – June 19, 1867) was an American politician and military officer who was Democratic member to the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, Territorial Governor of Wisconsin and a veteran of the Black Hawk War. His son, Augustus C. Dodge, served as a U.S. Senator from Iowa; the two were the first and so far the only father-son pair to serve concurrently in the Senate, which they did from 1848 to 1855.

Henry Dodge was also the half-brother of Missouri Senator Lewis F. Linn. James Clarke, the Governor of Iowa Territory, was his son-in-law.

Henry Dodge was also a slave owner, possessing the body and lives of five enslaved men - Toby, Tom, Lear, Jim, and Joe — who worked as smelters long after he promised to free them.

==Early life==
Henry Dodge was the son of Israel Dodge and Nancy Hunter Dodge. Israel was from Connecticut and a veteran of the Battle of Brandywine, who came west to serve under his brother in the military command of George Rogers Clark. Nancy&#x27;s family similarly moved west and settled in Kentucky, and for a period of time the Hunter family was part of the settler colony whose population was recruited to support the garrison at the confluence of the Ohio River and the Mississippi River, known as Fort Jefferson. Henry Dodge was born in Vincennes (then under the jurisdiction of Virginia) when Nancy stopped over to visit Israel (on duty in Vincennes) on her way from Kaskaskia to Louisville. Henry was the first child in what is now Indiana who was born to parents from the colonies, the other residents of Vincennes being of Indian and French Canadian heritage.

Dodge was raised in Kentucky. In 1788 Israel abandoned the family and Henry was raised by his mother. (Nancy later remarried, and had a son Lewis who himself became an elected official.) At age 14 Dodge moved to Missouri to live with his father, who ran salt and lead operations. Although Henry returned to Kentucky occasionally (including to read law), his move to Missouri was permanent. In 1800, he married Christiana McDonald.

In 1805 Dodge was appointed deputy sheriff, reporting to his father. In 1806 Dodge was recruited by Aaron Burr to participate in Burr&#x27;s spurious attempt at creating a new country in the southwest, an incident known as the Burr conspiracy. Dodge and a companion went so far as to report to a concentration point for the affair in New Madrid. However, when they learned that Thomas Jefferson had deemed it a treasonous act, they immediately abandoned the effort and returned home. Dodge was indicted as a participant in the conspiracy, but the charges were dropped.

In 1806 Dodge was named lieutenant of the militia. In 1813 he was appointed U.S. Marshal, as well as Sheriff of Ste. Genevieve County.

==Career==

===War of 1812===

In the War of 1812, Dodge entered as a captain in the Missouri State Volunteers. He was part of a mounted company. He finished the war as a major general of the Missouri Militia. His crowning achievement was saving about 150 Miami Indians from certain massacre after their raid on the Boone&#x27;s Lick settlement in the summer of 1814.

Dodge emigrated with his large family and slaves inherited from his father to the U.S. Mineral District in early July 1827. He served as a commander of militia during the Red Bird uprising of that year, and in October settled a large tract in present-day downtown Dodgeville, known then as &quot;Dodge&#x27;s Camp.&quot; He worked a large claim until around 1830, when he moved several miles south in a beautiful forested area known still as &quot;Dodge&#x27;s Grove.&quot; Here he began building what would become a large two-story frame house for his ever-growing extended family. It is worthy to note that, despite the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 banning slavery in the entire Northwest Territory, including Wisconsin, Dodge brought five black slaves from Missouri to work in his lead mines.

===Black Hawk War===

Dodge rose to prominence during the Black Hawk War of 1832. As colonel of the western Michigan Territory Militia, Dodge brought a credible fighting force into being in a very short time. More than fifteen forts, fortified homes and blockhouses sprang up almost overnight. From these forts, Dodge and the mounted volunteers, with four companies of Territorial militia and one of Illinois mounted rangers, took to the field as the &quot;Michigan Mounted Volunteers.&quot; Dodge and his men saw action at the battles of Horseshoe Bend, Wisconsin Heights, and Bad Axe. In June 1832, he accepted a commission as Major of the Battalion of Mounted Rangers, commissioned by an Act of Congress. Apparently, he took no prisoners. None of the 12 or 13 shot at Horseshoe Bend survived.

In the summer of 1832, he told a delegation of Ho-Chunk chiefs: &quot;You will have your country taken from you, your annuity money will be forfeited, and the lives of your people lost.&quot; In the Battle of Bad Axe in August 1832, Dodge and his militia massacred or contributed to the massacre of nearly 1000 Sauk men, women, and children as they attempted to cross the Mississippi River South of La Crosse, Wisconsin.

===United States Regiment of Dragoons===
The ranger experiment lasted a year, and then, in 1833, was replaced by the United States Regiment of Dragoons. Dodge served as colonel; one of his captains was Nathan Boone, Daniel Boone&#x27;s youngest son. The United States Regiment of Dragoons was the fourth mounted Regular Army unit in United States Army history, not including the American Revolution, Continental Light Dragoons.

In the summer of 1834, Colonel Dodge engaged on First Dragoon Expedition and made successful contact with the Comanches. He was an Indian fighter, most noted for his 1835 peace mission commissioned by President Andrew Jackson, who had called out the U.S. Dragoons to assist.

===Territorial governor===
Dodge was the first Territorial governor of Wisconsin Territory from 1836 to 1841 and again from 1845 to 1848, an area which encompassed (before July 4, 1838, when Iowa became a territory) what became the states of Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota. In between his two terms as governor, Dodge was elected as a non-voting Democratic delegate to the Twenty-seventh and Twenty-eighth Congresses (March 4, 1841 – March 3, 1845) representing Wisconsin Territory&#x27;s at-large congressional district.

As territorial governor, Dodge was also Superintendent of the Wisconsin Superintendency of the Indian Agency. Under pressure not from settlers but from developers and businessmen interested in logging, he negotiated a treaty with Ojibwe from east central Minnesota east of the Mississippi and west of the St. Croix River and Ojibwe from west central Wisconsin starting at the east side of the St. Croix including St. Croix Falls and including the northern section of the Chippewa River to Chippewa Falls in July 1837, sometimes dubbed &quot;the Pine Tree Treaty.&quot; The U.S. would allow the Ojibwe to remain on the land and retain their rights to fish, hunt, and gather, but ironically the land would be surveyed and sold as well. Payments would only be for twenty years. The Ojibwe were told that they would have to move at an undetermined time in the future and could only stay &quot;at the pleasure of the President.&quot;

Dodge declined the opportunity to have his name put forward for the Presidency of the United States at the 1844 Democratic National Convention. He was loyal to Martin Van Buren and both men opposed the annexation of Texas. Despite their efforts, James K. Polk, the Democrat who favored annexation, became president.

Upon Wisconsin being admitted to the Union in 1848, Dodge was elected one of its first two senators. He served two terms. He turned down the appointment of Territorial Governor of Washington from Franklin Pierce in 1857.

==Death==
Dodge died in 1867 in Burlington, Iowa. He is interred at the Aspen Grove Cemetery in Burlington.

==Legacy==
In 1948, Iowa County presented a 160-acre estate to the State of Wisconsin which eventually became Governor Dodge State Park. Over the years, this park has grown to include 5,270 acres in the area Dodge once called his home.

Dodge County, Wisconsin, Dodge County, Minnesota, Henry County, Iowa, Dodgeville, Wisconsin, and Fort Dodge, Iowa were named after Dodge.

Fort Clark, the U.S. Army post built near the present-day location of Fort Dodge, Iowa, was renamed for Senator Dodge around 1850.

His former cabin in Dodgeville, now known as the Dodge Mining Camp Cabin, serves as a museum and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="511793" wikidata="Q1554299" url="?curid=511793" title="Gulfstream Aerospace">
<text>Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation is an American aircraft company and a subsidiary of General Dynamics.
Gulfstream designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and services business jet aircraft. Gulfstream has produced more than 2,000 aircraft since 1958. Gulfstream&#x27;s aircraft consist of the G280, G400, G500/G600, and G650/G650ER/G700/G800.

==History==

===Origins===
The company that evolved into Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. started in the late 1950s when Grumman Aircraft Engineering Co., known for military aircraft production, developed a twin turboprop business aircraft at its facilities in Bethpage, New York, called the Grumman Gulfstream I (G-I). The G-I could seat 12 passengers, had a maximum speed of at and a range of . The new aircraft, the first of its kind designed for business travel, was a success, prompting Grumman to develop the jet-powered Grumman Gulfstream II or GII.

===1960s===
At the start of the GII program, Grumman officials separated the company&#x27;s civil and military aircraft production to improve efficiency. In 1966, they relocated the civilian component to Savannah, Georgia where they had found a supply of skilled labor, an airfield adjacent to the plant and room for expansion. Transportation facilities suitable for heavy equipment and machinery as well as weather favorable to year-round flight-testing and flight-training operations enhanced Savannah&#x27;s appeal. The new building opened in June 1967 and was dedicated on September 29, 1967. It housed production and flight testing for the GII. The 100-person work force that built the GII was 90% local, and grew to over 1,700 within a few years.

===1970s===
On January 2, 1973, Grumman merged its civil aircraft operations with light-aircraft manufacturer American Aviation Corporation. The 256th and final GII delivery took place in 1977. One year later, the Gulfstream line and the Savannah plant were sold to American Jet Industries, which was headed by entrepreneur Allen Paulson. Paulson became the president and CEO of the company, renaming it Gulfstream American. He made a priority of developing the Gulfstream III. The GIII was a new aircraft designed to achieve greater range and speed than the GII. The GIII made its first flight in December 1979, with the first delivery in 1980. It was the first business jet designed to fly over both poles. The Hustler 400 was a corporate aircraft that featured a propeller in front for short runway use, and a jet in back for high-altitude cruising. The prototype, designated Hustler 400, first flew on January 11, 1978, but never entered production.

===1980s===

In 1981, Gulfstream introduced the Gulfstream GIIB. The GIIB had a modified GII fuselage and the GIII wings, complete with winglets. The variant offered weight and performance characteristics similar to the GIII, but with the shorter GII fuselage. Gulfstream completed and delivered approximately 40 GIIBs.

Under Paulson the Savannah work force grew to 2,500 by the spring of 1982. Also in this year, the company&#x27;s name changed to Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation to reflect its worldwide scope, and a new plane, the Gulfstream IV, was conceived. The following year, Gulfstream offered 8.8 million shares of stock to the public. In 1985, Chrysler Corp. acquired Gulfstream for $637 million as part of the automaker&#x27;s plan to diversify into high-tech industries. This was also the year that Gulfstream first appeared on the Fortune 500 list, at No. 417. Two years later, the 200th and last Gulfstream III was delivered, and the first delivery of a Gulfstream IV took place. The GIV was the first jet in business aviation to have an all-glass cockpit. In 1989 Chrysler decided to sell Gulfstream, and Paulson teamed with Forstmann Little &amp; Co. – a private equity firm specializing in leveraged buyouts – and bought Gulfstream back.

===1990s===
The decade that followed the 1989 repurchase was a time of significant advancements for Gulfstream. The company signed a five-year contract with NetJets in 1994. It completed the Gulfstream V Integration Test Facility and rolled out the GV – the first ultra-long range business jet – in 1995. The opening of a $16 million Savannah service center with of hangar space followed in 1996. In 1997, Gulfstream began the simultaneous manufacture of two aircraft models – the GIV-SP and the GV. Within a few months of the GV&#x27;s first delivery in June 1997, it set nearly 40 city-pair and/or speed and distance records, and its development team was awarded the 1997 Robert J. Collier Trophy, the highest honor in aeronautics or astronautics in North America. In 1998, Gulfstream purchased K-C Aviation from Kimberly-Clark Corp. for $250 million, which had operations in Dallas, Appleton, Wisconsin, and Westfield, Massachusetts.

===2000s===
In 1999, General Dynamics purchased Gulfstream, and it opened a $5.5 million aircraft refurbishment and completions support facility in Savannah in 2000. In 2001, it acquired Galaxy Aerospace and with it, the mid-size Astra SPX and super mid-size Galaxy, which were later rebranded the Gulfstream G100 and Gulfstream G200, respectively. Also in 2001, Gulfstream purchased four U.S. maintenance facilities in Dallas, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, and West Palm Beach, Florida. Those service centers, along with a Gulfstream facility in Westfield, Massachusetts, formed General Dynamics Aviation Services, which maintained and repaired Gulfstream and other business-jet aircraft.

In 2002, Gulfstream renamed its products, using Arabic numerals instead of Roman numerals to differentiate its aircraft. At the time, the company&#x27;s lineup included the ultra long-range Gulfstream G550 and G500, the long-range Gulfstream G400, the mid-range Gulfstream G300 and G200, and the high-speed G100. 2002 was also the year that Gulfstream introduced its Airborne Product Support aircraft, a specially equipped G100 used to deliver parts and provide any-time service to Gulfstream customers under warranty in North America and the Caribbean.

In 2003, Gulfstream acquired a service center at the London-Luton Airport, the first Gulfstream-owned service center to be operated outside the United States. Also, in 2003, the long-range Gulfstream G450 was introduced. The large-cabin, mid-range G350 was presented a year later. In 2004, Gulfstream was awarded the 2003 Collier Trophy for the development of the G550. It was the second time in less than a decade that Gulfstream had won the award. The G550 is the first civil aircraft to receive a Type Certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that includes an Enhanced Vision System (EVS) as standard equipment on an aircraft. The aircraft also contained the first cockpit to incorporate PlaneView®, an integrated avionics suite featuring four 14-inch (36 cm) liquid crystal displays in landscape format.

In 2005, Gulfstream began to offer an in-flight internet connection – its Broad Band Multi-Link (BBML) system. Gulfstream also designed and developed a means of reducing the sonic boom caused by an aircraft &quot;breaking&quot; the sound barrier – the Quiet Spike. The Quiet Spike is a telescopic nose device that softens the effect of the sonic boom by smoothing the pressure wave created by flying at the speed of sound. Gulfstream views lifting the current US supersonic ban as essential for a viable business case for supersonic aircraft.

In 2006, the 12-year production run of the G100 ended, and the Gulfstream G150 entered service to take its place. The G150 was the first business jet to be certified by the FAA for Stage 4, the industry&#x27;s most stringent noise standards. Also in 2006, Gulfstream announced plans to expand its manufacturing and service facilities in Savannah. The seven-year, $400 million Long-Range Facilities Master Plan included the creation of a new service center, an independent fuel farm, a paint hangar and the addition of a new Sales and Design Center. As a result of the expansion, employment at the facility was expected to grow by some 1,100 jobs. To meet the immediate need for engineering office space, Gulfstream opened a Research and Development Center (RDC). The RDC accommodates approximately 750 technical and engineering employees.

In April 2007 Gulfstream broke ground for a new business-jet manufacturing building at its headquarters in Savannah. The following month, the company signed a nine-year lease with North Point Real Estate for a second Research and Development Center. The RDC II consists of an office building, which can accommodate 550 employees, and a laboratory building, which is designed for 150 employees and test equipment used in Gulfstream&#x27;s research and development work. Gulfstream completed the new Sales and Design Center addition in June and officially opened the first phase of the new Savannah Service Center in August.

In 2007, Gulfstream tested its Synthetic Vision-Primary Flight Display (SV-PFD) and EVS II together for the first time. The SV-PFD is an enhancement to the Gulfstream PlaneView flight displays. It features a three-dimensional color image of terrain overlaid with the primary flight display instrument symbology, which are arranged on the screen to create a large-view area for terrain. By early 2008, the FAA had certified both EVS II and SV-PFD.

On March 13, 2008, Gulfstream announced the introduction of a new business jet: the Gulfstream G650. The G650 offered the longest range, fastest speed, largest cabin and most advanced cockpit in the Gulfstream fleet. It is capable of traveling at Mach 0.85 or will cover shorter distances at Mach 0.925, making it the fastest civilian aircraft flying at the time. It can climb to , allowing it to avoid airline-traffic congestion and adverse weather.

On October 5 of the same year, Gulfstream announced another addition to its business-jet fleet: the large-cabin, mid-range Gulfstream G250 (later renamed the Gulfstream G280). It is capable of traveling at Mach 0.80 and has a maximum operating speed of Mach 0.85. It can reach its initial cruise altitude in 20 minutes and can climb to a maximum altitude of .

In 2009, the company conducted two powered rollouts one week apart. The Gulfstream G650 officially rolled out of the Savannah manufacturing facility under its own power on September 29, 2009. The G280 followed just one week later.

Both the G650 and the G280 flew before the end of 2009. The G650 took its first flight on November 25, while the G280 went up for the first time on December 11.

===2010s===
In November 2010, Gulfstream announced an expansion of its Savannah facilities through a $500-million, seven-year plan. The growth resulted in 1,000 additional Gulfstream jobs, an increase of more than 15 percent.
In addition to the Savannah expansion, Gulfstream&#x27;s sites in Westfield, Massachusetts, US, and Luton, UK, also grew in 2011. In October, Gulfstream announced an expansion of its service center at the Barnes Regional Airport in Westfield, Massachusetts, that will result in 100 additional Gulfstream jobs, a nearly 80 percent increase over the size of Gulfstream&#x27;s Westfield workforce. The Luton service center also relocated to a 75,000-square-foot, more modern hangar. The hangar and accompanying office area nearly doubles space at the site, allowing Gulfstream Luton technicians to service Gulfstream&#x27;s entire fleet, including the all-new G650, the company&#x27;s flagship aircraft.

Gulfstream suffered a major setback on April 2, 2011, when one of its G650 ultra long-range business jets crashed on the runway at Roswell, NM, fatally injuring the two test pilots and two flight test engineers on board. The aircraft was conducting a takeoff-performance test during which an engine failure was simulated by reducing the right engine&#x27;s thrust to idle. The G650 became airborne briefly at a high angle of attack before its right wingtip hit the runway, then slid on the ground and caught fire.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined the probable cause of the crash was an aerodynamic stall of the aircraft due to a failure to properly develop and validate takeoff speeds, persistent and increasingly aggressive attempts to achieve a V2 speed that was too low and an inadequate investigation of previous uncommanded roll events. Following the crash, Gulfstream raised the V2 speed of the G650. The NTSB accused Gulfstream of withholding information and the use of legal counsel during the investigation, which were denied by the company.

In November 2011, the Gulfstream G650 received its provisional type certificate (PTC) from the FAA. This cleared the way for the company to begin interior completions of the ultra-large-cabin, ultra-long-range business jet in preparation for customer deliveries in the second quarter of 2012, as originally planned.

In January 2011, General Dynamics Aviation Services was rebranded as Gulfstream to simplify its brand identity. Gulfstream now owns and operates nine service centers worldwide, plus one component repair facility.

As of late 2012 there were indications that Gulfstream was close to announcing the design of a quiet supersonic business jet, first drawings of which appeared in December 2012.

Gulfstream employs more than 11,500 people at 12 major locations: Savannah, Georgia.; Appleton, Wisconsin; Brunswick, Georgia; Dallas; Las Vegas; Westfield, Massachusetts; West Palm Beach, Florida; Van Nuys and Lincoln, California in the US; London, UK; Mexicali, Mexico, and Sorocaba, Brazil; 

The Gulfstream G500/G600 were unveiled on October 14, 2014, with the G500 taxiing under its own power. It first flew on May 18, 2015. The longer G600 followed on December 17, 2016, intended for delivery in 2018.

The company expects the 2017 deliveries to be the same as 2016 at 115 units: 88 large and 27 midsize G280s.

Following the meeting of US President Donald Trump and Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in July 2019, Qatar Airways expressed a desire to buy large-cabin aircraft from Gulfstream.

===2020s===

On October 4, 2021, the company introduced the G400 and G800 to their product line.

On 28 March, 2023, Gulfstream opened a sales and design center in Beverly Hills, housing mock ups for the G400, G700 and G800 cabins.

===Government and special mission aircraft===

About 200 Gulfstream are used by 35 governments, mainly the G550 : air transports of heads of state and government, airborne early warning, medical evacuation, high-altitude atmospheric research, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.

<doc id="511796" wikidata="Q1982545" url="?curid=511796" title="New England Complex Systems Institute">
<text>The New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI) is an independent American research institution and think tank dedicated to advancing analytics and its application to the challenges of society, and the interaction of complex systems with the environment. NECSI offers educational programs, conducts research, and hosts the International Conference on Complex Systems. It was founded in 1996 and is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

== Overview ==
NECSI was established in 1996 by faculty of various New England academic institutions, including MIT, Harvard, Brandeis, and others, to encourage communication and collaboration among researchers studying complex systems.

The NECSI web site describes &quot;complex systems&quot; as follows: 

Complex systems have multiple interacting components whose collective behavior cannot be simply inferred from the behavior of components. The recognition that understanding the parts cannot explain collective behavior has led to various new concepts and methodologies that are affecting all fields of science and engineering, and are being applied to technology, business and even social policy. 

NECSI promotes collaboration and dissemination of new research among complex systems researchers in wide-ranging disciplines and numerous institutions. NECSI&#x27;s activities for this purpose include hosting an international research conference and maintaining a roster of affiliated scholars and co-faculty.

== International Conference on Complex Systems ==
NECSI hosts the International Conference on Complex Systems (ICCS), whose aims are:

first, to investigate those properties or characteristics that appear to be common to the very different complex systems now under study; and second, to encourage cross fertilization among the many disciplines involved.
ICCS takes place on an occasional basis, with the most recent (eighth conference) in 2011. ICCS conferences have featured notable computer scientists (e.g., Gerald Sussman), mathematicians (e.g., Stephen Wolfram), systems theorists (e.g., John Sterman), physicists (e.g. Sandy Pentland), economists (e.g., James Stock), and others. 
Events at ICCS include research presentations and workshops, as well as pedagogical sessions aimed at a wider community.

== Affiliates and co-faculty ==
NECSI provides a public platform for affiliates and co-faculty at numerous academic institutions, primarily in the New England region. These researchers also contribute to NECSI educational programs.

== Research areas ==

=== Evolution and ecology ===
NECSI researchers have contributed to the understanding of evolutionary dynamics, the evolution of altruism, the origin and characterization of biodiversity, and the interplay between evolution and ecology.

Much of the work done at NECSI has focused on the role of the spatial distribution of species, an often overlooked factor of evolutionary dynamics. In the case where portions of a population are geographically isolated from each other, for example, Yaneer Bar-Yam was able to demonstrate shortcomings in the gene-centered view of evolution, an approximation that is valid only if there is complete mixing of alleles in the gene pool.

=== Networks ===
Studies of network topologies have found surprising similarities between a variety of complex social, technological and biological networks. NECSI research in networks focuses on the relationship between structure, dynamics and function. The study of networks has emerged in diverse disciplines as a means of analyzing complex relational data.

=== Social systems ===
NECSI research in social systems focuses on the collective actions that create revolutions, ethnic violence, urban health, fads and panics, global food and so on. The role of individuals and organization can be analyzed by techniques and tools of complex systems.

=== Representation ===
Complex systems exhibit behaviors at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Researchers working at NECSI have developed a mathematical formalism for simultaneously describing systems on multiple scales. This formalism had been applied to physical systems, information systems, organizational behavior, engineering projects and military conflict.

An essential tool for multiscale analysis, the complexity profile, the relationship between the observed complexity of a system and the scale of observation.

=== Post-crisis focus on social and economic systems ===
Since 2009, the Institute&#x27;s research focus has shifted to socio-economic systems, with particular attention to the causes and consequences of the 2008 financial crisis and dynamics of Twitter networks and social sentiment. Policy-relevant articles on stock market regulation and market crashes, food riots and the causes of high food prices, and the European bond crisis have been released straight to the press. Peer-reviewed articles continue to appear on other subjects.

=== Further fields of research ===
* Systems biology
* Systems engineering
* Organizational management
* Negotiation
* Network Science

==Herbert A. Simon Award==
The Herbert A. Simon Award is given by the Institute to &quot;researchers who have made important lifetime contributions to the field of complex systems science.&quot; The winners are:
*  Melanie Mitchell
* H. Eugene Stanley
* Thomas Schelling
* Muhammad Yunus
* John F. Nash Jr.
* Philip W. Anderson
* Stuart Kauffman

== Public attention ==
NECSI&#x27;s work on the global food crisis has been widely cited by the press, by movements to curb financial speculation, and included among the top-10 discoveries in science in 2011 by Wired. NECSI&#x27;s scientific visualizations have received multiple citations on top-10 lists.

NECSI has been called &quot;a pioneer in using mathematics, computation and other quantitative methods to analyse topics like ethnic violence, economic crises and healthcare systems&quot; by the press.

=== Early Warning on the COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic ===
Prior to global lockdowns, in January, 2020 Joseph Norman, Yaneer Bar Yam, and Nassim Taleb submitted a paper to the White House administration, urging them to take drastic steps to curtail the disease. NECSI later assembled EndCoronaVirus.org, which included over 4,000 volunteers by March 21, 2020. The network of volunteers built endCoronavirus.org with the goal to minimize the impact of COVID-19 by providing useful data and guidelines for action.

<text>USS &quot;Furse&quot; (DD-882/DDR-882) was a of the United States Navy in commission from 1945 to 1972. She served as &quot;Gravina&quot; (D62) in the [[Spanish Navy from 1972 to 1991.

==Namesake==
John Houseal Furse was born on 20 April 1880 in [[South Carolina]]. He was a member of the [[United States Naval Academy]] class of 1901. His first service was on the [[Asiatic Station]], where he served in [[Manila]] during a scientific expedition, as well as in other ships. Returning to the United States, he joined the on 29 September 1904, and served in [[Cuba]]n waters. Lieutenant Furse died on board &quot;Illinois&quot; on 30 September 1907, of injuries received fighting a storm which threatened the ship.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Furse&quot; was laid down by the [[Consolidated Steel Corporation]] at [[Orange, Texas]] on 23 September 1944, launched on 9 March 1945 by Miss Eugenia A. Furse, sister of Lieutenant Furse and commissioned on 10 July 1945.

==Service history==
&quot;Furse&quot; sailed from [[Norfolk, Virginia]] on 7 November 1945 for occupation duty in the Far East, calling at [[San Diego]], California and [[Pearl Harbor]] en route to [[Tokyo Bay]], where she arrived on 22 December. After acting as courier between [[Nagoya]] and [[Wakayama, Wakayama|Wakayama]], she conducted training operations out of [[Kobe]], then sailed back to Pearl Harbor to prepare for participation in &quot;[[Operation Crossroads]]&quot;. In this operation, atomic weapons tests in the [[Marshall Islands]] during the summer of 1946, &quot;Furse&quot; acted as [[plane guard]] to carriers of JTF 1.

The destroyer returned to San Diego on 12 August 1946, and until her transfer to the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]] in April 1949, operated on training along the west coast, and completed another tour of duty in the Far East. She was reclassified DDR-882 on 18 March 1949. She arrived at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], on 21 April 1949. On 10 September, she sailed on the first of her tours of duty with the [[United States Sixth Fleet|6th Fleet]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], which were annual, aside from 1951 and 1959, through 1960. From January 1951, &quot;Furse&quot; was homeported at Norfolk. (Her homeport from 1959 to 1962 was Charleston, South Carolina) Early in 1963 &quot;Furse&quot; was in the Shipyard in Philadelphia for FRAM overhaul.

Among the highlights of the destroyer&#x27;s operations were visits to ports of northern Europe between September 1950 and December, during which she represented the United States at the funeral of [[Gustaf V of Sweden|King Gustav V]] of Sweden. From 1952 onward, she often served with the [[Operational Test and Evaluation Force|Operational Development Force]], perfecting techniques in anti-submarine warfare. A [[midshipman]] summer cruise in 1952 again took her to ports of northern Europe. Marking her 1956 tour of duty in the Mediterranean was her participation in the evacuation of Americans from [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]] during the [[Suez Crisis]], and lengthy patrol duty in the eastern Mediterranean. The next year, she made two tours of duty in the Mediterranean because of the tense political situation prevailing, and in the summer of 1958, she sailed for [[NATO]] operations in northern waters, visiting [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], Spain; [[Stavanger]], Norway; and [[Ghent]], Belgium. In the periods between her deployments, &quot;Furse&quot; carried out the intensive training schedule of Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet, cruising the east coast and the Caribbean in operations with ships of all types and major fleet exercises.

&quot;Furse&quot; was part of the blockade in October 1962, during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].

During June 1965 &quot;Furse&quot; was a unit of recovery force for the fourth Gemini astronaut space shot. In the winter of 1967, &quot;Furse&quot; spent time in the Boston Naval Shipyard receiving her regular yard overhaul period in preparation for a WESTPAC cruise in the summer of 1968. For a fuller description of this cruise, the first on which Furse was in active combat and was hit by enemy fire, see &quot;School of Hard Knots&quot;, a memoir by junior officer on Furse, Henry (Hank) Abernathy. Captained by Michael T. Greeley USN, Furse operated with the Seventh Fleet in the Tonkin Gulf, including the recommissioned battleship USS New Jersey (BB 62). Shortly after her yard period, she took part in refresher training in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba followed by Fleet exercises in the Atlantic and Caribbean.

=== In Spanish Navy ===
&quot;Furse&quot; was decommissioned on 31 August 1972, and stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 2 June 1975. She was transferred to Spain and renamed &quot;Gravina&quot;. &quot;Gravina&quot; was scrapped in 1991.

<doc id="511801" wikidata="Q6815296" url="?curid=511801" title="Memon people">
<text>The Memon are a Muslim community in Gujarat India, and Sindh, Pakistan, the majority of whom follow the Hanafi fiqh of Sunni Islam. They are divided into different groups based on their origins: Kathiawari Memons, Kutchi Memons and Bantva Memons from the Kathiawar, Kutch and Bantva regions of Gujarat respectively, and Sindhi Memons from Sindh.

Memons have cultural similarities with the Khoja, Bohra, and other Gujarati peoples. They speak the Memoni language as their first language, which shares vocabulary with the Sindhi language, Kutchi language and Gujarati languages.

Today Memons are connected through globally recognized organisations such as the World Memon Organisation (WMO) and International Memon Organisation (IMO).

== History ==

=== Sindhi, Gujarati origins ===

Memon lineage traces back to the Lohanas who traditionally practiced Hinduism. The origin of the name comes from Mu&#x27;min (, &quot;believer&quot; in Arabic) and later evolved to present name Memon. The Memon community was founded in the 15th century by 700 families comprising 6,178 persons total. According to Anthovan, those Lohanas of Thatta, Sindh who converted from Hinduism to Islam became Memons and were invited by Rao Khengarji Jadeja, ruler of Bhuj in the 16th century, to settle in Bhuj. It is from there that Kutchi Memons migrated to Kathiawar and mainland Gujarat. Surat in Gujarat was an important trading centre from 1580 to 1680. 

=== Merchant tradesman ===

Due to the mercantile nature of the community, Memons began a significant migration beyond the borders of India in the 18th and 19th centuries. This led to communities developing in the Middle East, South Africa, Sri Lanka and East Asia. Memon traders set up a network of joint stock companies acting in coordination with other members in an area ranging from Central Africa to China. Memon donors made significant financial contributions to construct mosques during this time, including Juma Masjid Mosque and Jamia Mosque. By late 19th century several thousand Memons had settled in Mumbai due to trading. The area of Mumbai in which the Memon traders congregated later became known as the Memonwada.

=== 20th century ===
The early 20th century saw a consolidation of the Memon community in South Asia as well as South Africa. They began to organise important societies including Memon Education and Welfare Society and Memon Chamber of Commerce. Memon community made significant financial contributions to preserve the Ottoman Empire but were unable to prevent its decline. The partition of India led to significant migration in both directions for the community. The principal mass of Memons was and is composed of petty tradesmen,
shopkeepers, grocers, wandering peddlers, and agents and clerks in firms. In regions of Kutch (India), and near Karachi and on the Makran coast of present day Pakistan, the Memons are still engaged in commercial agriculture, gardening, and fishing.

=== Branches ===

====Subgroups of Memons from Kathiawar====
=== Languages ===
==Social structure==

===Cultural traditions===

While Memons are generally Sunni Muslims, many continue to follow Modern Hindu law in matters regarding property inheritance, community leadership structure and mutual support for members. Memon see themselves to be from the Buddhist Kshatriya lineage. Even within Memons, there are caste hierarchies that some follow regarding marriage practices.

According to folklore, the blessings of the Islamic saint Sayad Kadiri upon the Memons are responsible for their success in business and trade. A more pragmatic explanation for their success is that Memon have been historically considered honest brokers. Following commercial caste model, Memons also offer support community members in financial matters by giving loans and offering business assistance. The community annually celebrates 11 April as &quot;Memons Day&quot; through acts of humanitarian service.

===Memons worldwide===

Today, Memon communities are scattered throughout the world including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. However, major concentrations of Memon remain located in Karachi, Pakistan and Gujarat, India. In Karachi there is a community of Memon people from Bantva and their descendants known as Bantva Memons. United under the banner of Halari Memon General Jama&#x27;at, the Halari Memon are another category and followers of the Hanafi school.

Memons were also one of three classes living in South Africa when Mahatma Gandhi went there in 1893, Memons were traders serving the Indian diaspora in South Africa. Memons are known for their involvement in business and philanthropy, with Memons having played a major part in the building of Pakistani industry.

<text>USS &quot;Newman K. Perry&quot; (DD-883/DDR-883), was a of the United States Navy.

==Namesake==
Newman Kershaw Perry was born on 28 November 1880 in South Carolina. He was appointed Naval Cadet on 9 September 1897 and commissioned Ensign on 7 June 1903. Stationed on the , he was killed by a boiler explosion on that ship at San Diego on 21 July 1905.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Newman K. Perry&quot; was laid down by the Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas on 10 October 1944, launched on 17 March 1945 by Mrs. Laura P. Gunter, sister of Ensign Perry and commissioned on 26 July 1945.

==Service history==

===1945–1949===
Following shakedown, &quot;Newman K. Perry&quot; served briefly with the Atlantic Fleet. On 7 November 1945, she got underway for Pearl Harbor, whence she traveled to Japan for three months&#x27; occupation duty. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 28 March 1946 and was assigned to Joint Task Force 1 for &quot;Operation Crossroads&quot;, the 1946 atomic bomb test series at Bikini. Sailing for the Marshall Islands on 27 May, she witnessed tests &quot;Able&quot; and &quot;Baker&quot; and, in August, steamed for the United States.

On 18 August she arrived at San Diego whence she operated until 25 August 1947. Then, with DesDiv 132, she headed west, arriving at Yokosuka on 13 September. Three days later she sailed to Qingdao to commence a series of patrol, escort, search and rescue, ASW, and hydrographic survey missions and exercises along the China coast and off Taiwan and Okinawa. Relieved on 5 May 1948, she returned to San Diego, trained naval reservists through the summer, and in October entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul.

The destroyer departed San Francisco on 15 January 1949 and until April conducted exercises off the west coast. On 4 April, she departed San Diego with DesDiv 182 for Newport, Rhode Island, her new homeport, arriving 21 April.

===1950–1968===
After her return to Destroyer Forces, Atlantic Fleet, she rotated tours with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea and midshipmen and reservist training cruises, and fleet, squadron and type training exercises with the 2nd Fleet. Redesignated a radar picket destroyer in 1950, she conducted her scheduled operations as DDR–883 until 1964 when &quot;Newman K. Perry&quot; underwent the FRAM I refit at the Boston Naval Shipyard until February 1965. The most visible alteration were the new bridge, the addition of a hangar and landing deck aft for the Gyrodyne QH-50 DASH drone and the addition of an ASROC launcher between the funnels. Modernized into a &quot;regular&quot; destroyer again, she resumed the designation DD-883.

On 26 August 1965, she collided with the aircraft carrier off Sardinia, in the Mediterranean, killing one and injuring another. She was repaired at Naples. A change in operations in 1959 took her to Charleston, South Carolina, which served as her homeport for several years before she resumed operations out of Newport.

A second change in operations took her to the Western Pacific for her overseas deployment in 1966. Departing Newport with Destroyer Division 201 on 4 October, she transited the Panama Canal, stopped in Hawaii, Japan, Okinawa and the Philippines, and arrived on station in the Mekong Delta of South Vietnam on 23 November. Assigned to fire support duties, she shelled enemy coastal storage areas until the 28th. She then shifted to Phú Quốc island, off the Cambodian-South Vietnamese border, to support Vietnamese and Special Forces units for five days, returning to the Delta area in December. Other assignments on that tour with the 7th Fleet took her along the coast to the DMZ and then to the Gulf of Tonkin for plane guard and search and rescue missions. On 8 March 1967, she departed the combat zone for Hong Kong before returning to Subic Bay for the last time. On the 27th she departed the Philippines for the Mediterranean and Newport, arriving on 8 May.

After overhaul at Boston, &quot;Newman K. Perry&quot; began 1968, with Caribbean exercises and on 4 April departed Newport for the Mediterranean to resume her annual deployments with the 6th Fleet.

===1969–1981===

In the 1971 &quot;Newman K. Perry&quot; was assigned to the Naval Reserve Force (NRF) as a unit of Destroyer Squadron 28. She was based in Newport, Rhode Island with a composite crew of active and reserve sailors. In Oct 1974, she hit a buoy foundation in NY harbor, opening a hole in the scoop injection of the forward engine room. After emergency repairs, she spent the night tied to a pier in Hoboken, NJ. Choppy seas from a storm that night broke open a steam pipe in the forward boiler room, as the ship was slammed into the pier for most of the night. A month in drydock at Todd Shipyards in Brooklyn followed. Then she left for Norfolk to test guns, where a forward turret misfired, causing further damage. She was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 27 February 1981.

==ROKS &quot;Kyong Ki&quot;==
&quot;Newman K. Perry&quot; was transferred to South Korea in 1981 for service in the Republic of Korea Navy and renamed ROKS &quot;Kyong Ki&quot;. South Korea decommissioned &quot;Kyong Ki&quot; in 1997. She later was damaged by fire and scrapped in 1999.

<doc id="511806" wikidata="Q3646456" url="?curid=511806" title="Buddy Jewell">
<text>Buddy Jewell Jr. (born April 2, 1961) is an American country music singer who was the first winner on the USA Network talent show &quot;Nashville Star&quot;. Signed to Columbia Records in 2003, Jewell made his debut on the American country music scene with the release of his self-titled album, which produced the singles &quot;Help Pour Out the Rain&quot; and &quot;Sweet Southern Comfort&quot;. Another album, &quot;Times Like These&quot;, followed in 2005.

== Biography ==
Buddy Jewell was born in Lepanto, Arkansas, on April 2, 1961. He began playing guitar after buying one from a schoolmate during childhood, and saved the money that he earned bagging groceries to buy guitar lesson books. Jewell also listened to the music that his father, also named Buddy, played for him, and was taught by his uncle Clyde how to play &quot;What a Friend We Have in Jesus&quot;. By age 15, Jewell had also taught himself how to play Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;I Still Miss Someone.&quot; After graduating from Osceola High School, he attended Arkansas State University where he was a member of Pi Kappa Alpha. Jewell majored in television and radio in college, although he left in his junior year to marry, despite the marriage only lasting two-and-a-half years.

Jewell later moved to Camden, Arkansas, at age 21 in pursuit of a musical career. There, he discovered a band called White Oak, which was seeking a new lead singer. This band was sponsored by a booking agency whose roster also included Canyon and a band founded by a then-unknown Trace Adkins. After touring with White Oak for four years, he moved to Dallas, Texas, where he took a role in a gunfighting show at Six Flags over Texas. He later entered a singing competition that was sponsored by the band Alabama, whose music was also an inspiration to him. He won the competition&#x27;s top prize, which was an opening slot for the band.

After winning the competition, he competed on &quot;Star Search&quot; where he won Male Vocalist on several episodes. He later decided to move to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1993, and found work two years later as a demo singer. As a demo singer, he recorded more than 5,000 demos. Among the songs that Jewell recorded demos for were &quot;Write This Down&quot; for George Strait, &quot;A Little Past Little Rock&quot; for Lee Ann Womack, &quot;The One&quot; for Gary Allan and &quot;You&#x27;re Beginning to Get to Me&quot; for Clay Walker. Jewell also self-released albums entitled &quot;One in a Row&quot; and &quot;Far Enough Away&quot; in 2001 and 2002 respectively. In 1999, he appeared on comedian Bill Engvall&#x27;s album &quot;Dorkfish&quot;, providing vocals to the track &quot;I&#x27;m a Cowboy&quot; and appearing in its music video.

==&quot;Nashville Star&quot; and major-label music career==
In 2003, Jewell competed in the first season of the television singing competition &quot;Nashville Star&quot;. He became the show&#x27;s first winner that season, and was soon signed to a recording contract with Columbia Records Nashville.

===2003–2004: &quot;Buddy Jewell&quot;===
On May 5, 2003, two days after his win, Jewell&#x27;s debut single &quot;Help Pour Out the Rain&quot; was shipped to radio. It became the highest-debuting single by a new country artist since the singles charts were first tabulated via Nielsen SoundScan in 1990. This song reached number three on the country charts and 29 on the pop charts. It was the first single from his self-titled debut album, which was produced by former RCA Records artist Clint Black and was recorded in ten days. &quot;Buddy Jewell&quot; sold 500,000 copies and earned a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), in addition to producing a second number three country hit in &quot;Sweet Southern Comfort&quot;, which also reached number 40 on the pop charts. This song was followed by the number 38 country single &quot;One Step at a Time&quot;.

===2004–2005: &quot;Times Like These&quot;===
Jewell&#x27;s second album for Columbia, &quot;Times Like These&quot;, was released in 2005. This album did not perform as well at radio, with its first single (&quot;If She Were Any Other Woman&quot;) reaching number 27 on the charts, and the second single (&quot;So Gone&quot;) failing to chart entirely. By the end of the year, Jewell was dropped from Columbia&#x27;s roster.

===2005–2011: &quot;Country Enough&quot;===
He did not release another single until &quot;This Ain&#x27;t Mexico&quot; in 2008, a self-released single. This was included on an album entitled &quot;Country Enough&quot;, which was released on Diamond Dust Records in 2008. In May 2011 Jewell released a new album &quot;I Surrender All&quot;. He released two songs from this album &quot;Jesus, Elvis, And Me&quot; which was a country dance hit and &quot;Somebody Who Would Die For You&quot; which went up to No. 1 on the Christian Charts.

===2015: &quot;My Father&#x27;s Country&quot;===
In 2015, Jewell signed with Lamon Records in Nashville and recorded an album produced with Grammy nominated artist-producer Dave Moody. The album &quot;My Father&#x27;s Country&quot; featured a collection of classic country songs, including Abilene, Behind Closed Doors, Galveston and other songs Jewell grew up listening to his father sing. Buddy Jewell was inducted into the Arkansas Entertainers Hall of Fame on Tuesday, September 29, 2015, at the Noah&#x27;s Event Center in Little Rock, AR.

===2017–2019===

In 2017 Jewell recorded an EP album &quot;Reloaded&quot;. His single from the album is &quot;I&#x27;m There&quot; and it went to number one on the Power Source Christian Country charts.

<doc id="511809" wikidata="Q605817" url="?curid=511809" title="Jay-Jay Okocha">
<text>Augustine Azuka &quot;Jay-Jay&quot; Okocha ( ; born 14 August 1973) is a Nigerian former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. He had 73 caps for the Nigeria national team between 1993 and 2006, scoring 14 goals, and was a member of three FIFA World Cup squads. He is regarded as one of the greatest football players from Africa.

He played across multiple leagues, starting his career at Enugu Rangers in the Nigerian Professional Football League before moving to Borussia Neunkirchen in the Oberliga Südwest, Germany&#x27;s third division, in July 1990. He played in the Bundesliga, Süper Lig, Ligue 1, Premier League, EFL Championship, and Qatar Stars League before his retirement in 2008.

==Club career==
Okocha was born in Enugu, Enugu State. The name &quot;Jay-Jay&quot; was passed down from his elder brother James, who started playing football first; his immediate elder brother, Emmanuel was also called Emma Jay-Jay, but the name stuck with him instead. He began playing football on the streets just like many other football stars, usually with a makeshift ball.

In an interview with BBC Sport he said, &quot;As far as I can remember, we used to play with anything, with any round thing we could find, and whenever we managed to get hold of a ball, that was a bonus! I mean it was amazing!&quot; In 1990, he joined Enugu Rangers. In his time at the club he produced many spectacular displays, including one where he rounded off and scored a goal against experienced Nigerian goalkeeper Willy Okpara in a match against BCC Lions of Gboko. Later that year, he went on holiday to West Germany, the country that had just won the 1990 FIFA World Cup, so he could watch German league football. His friend Binebi Numa was playing in the Third Division for Borussia Neunkirchen, and one morning Okocha accompanied Numa to training, where he asked to join in. The Neunkirchen coach was impressed with Okocha&#x27;s skills and invited him back the next day before offering him a contract. A year later, he joined 1. FC Saarbrücken, but stayed only a few months with the 2. Bundesliga side before a move to the Bundesliga with Eintracht Frankfurt.

===Eintracht Frankfurt===
Okocha joined Eintracht Frankfurt in December 1991, where he linked up with many well-known players including Ghanaian international striker Tony Yeboah and later Thomas Doll. He continued to shine for the German side, one highlight being a goal he scored against Karlsruher SC, dribbling in the penalty box, even going past some players twice, and slotting the ball past goalkeeper Oliver Kahn. The goal was voted Goal of the Season by many football magazines, and also voted as the 1993 Goal of the Year by viewers of &quot;Sportschau&quot; (an ARD German TV sports programme). In 1995, Okocha, Yeboah and Maurizio Gaudino were all involved in a feud with manager Jupp Heynckes, which led to their departure from the club.

Yeboah and Gaudino later left for England, while Okocha stayed until the end of the season when Eintracht were relegated to the 2. Bundesliga, before signing for Süper Lig club Fenerbahçe. In the Bundesliga he scored 18 goals in 90 matches.

===Fenerbahçe===
Okocha joined Turkish club Fenerbahçe for approximately £1 million following Eintracht Frankfurt&#x27;s relegation to the 2. Bundesliga. In his two seasons with the team, he amassed 30 goals in 62 appearances, many of them coming from direct free kicks, which became something of a trademark for him at the club.

Okocha acquired Turkish citizenship during his time at the club and chose the name Muhammed Yavuz while playing.

===Paris Saint-Germain===
In 1998, French side Paris Saint-Germain spent around £14 million to sign Okocha, making him the most expensive African player at the time. In his four-year stint with PSG, he played 84 matches and scored 12 goals. He also served as a mentor for young Brazilian footballer and future Ballon d&#x27;Or winner Ronaldinho during his time in Paris.

In the 2001 UEFA Intertoto Cup Okocha would go on to score 5 goals and help PSG become joint champions along with Aston Villa F.C. and ES Troyes AC.

===Bolton Wanderers===
On 18 June Okocha joined Bolton Wanderers on a free transfer after leaving PSG in the summer of 2002 following the FIFA World Cup. His debut season, despite being hampered by injuries, made him a favourite with the Bolton fans, with the team printing shirts with the inscription &quot;Jay-Jay – so good they named him twice&quot;. He steered the team away from relegation with seven goals, including one later voted the team&#x27;s Goal of the Season in the vital league win against West Ham United. This was also chosen as Bolton&#x27;s best ever Premier League goal by a fan vote in 2008. The next season saw Okocha receive more responsibility as he was given the captain&#x27;s armband following Guðni Bergsson&#x27;s retirement. As captain he led Bolton to the 2004 Football League Cup final, their first cup final in nine years, where they finished runners-up to Middlesbrough.

In 2006, Okocha was stripped of the captaincy—something he said he had seen coming, as there had been a change in attitude from some staff members. This was likely due to his proposed move to the Middle East, which had been the subject of growing speculation. At the end of the season, he refused a one-year extension in order to move to Qatar.

Following Bolton&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League in 2012, Okocha stated that his spell at the club was now rendered a waste of time, because the club had not invested and improved on the foundations that were laid during his time there.

In 2017, Okocha was voted the best player to have ever played for Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok/Macron Stadium.

===Hull City===
After just one season in Qatar, Football League Championship side Hull City signed Okocha on a free transfer in 2007, after the player had been linked to Real Salt Lake and Sydney FC. It was a move he made saying that &quot;God had told him to do so&quot;. He was however unable to contribute greatly to Hull&#x27;s promotion campaign due to fitness and constant injury problems, playing only 18 games and scoring no goals. Hull still succeeded in winning promotion to the Premier League for the first time in their 104-year history. At the end of the season, after changing his mind on a proposed retirement due to Hull&#x27;s promotion, he was released by the club, which ultimately sent him into retirement.

In 2012 he came out of retirement and signed with Bengal Premier League Soccer team Durgapur Vox Champions. However, the season was postponed and the league itself folded in 2013 before him making any appearance for the team.

==International career==
Okocha made his official debut for Nigeria in their 2–1 1994 FIFA World Cup Qualifier away loss against Ivory Coast in May 1993. It was not until his second cap and home debut that he became a favourite with the Nigerian supporters. With Nigeria trailing 1–0 against Algeria, in a match they needed to win, he scored from a direct free kick to equalise, before helping the team to a 4–1 win, eventually securing qualification to their first World Cup. In 1994, he was a member of both the victorious 1994 African Cup of Nations squad and the World Cup squad who made it to the second round before losing a dramatic match against eventual runners-up Italy.

In 1996, Okocha became a key member of an arguably more successful Nigerian side, their Olympic gold winning side at the Atlanta Games, later nicknamed the &quot;Dream Team&quot; by the Nigerian press after the USA 1992 Olympics gold winning basketball team, as they overcame Brazil in the semi-finals, before coming back from 2–0 down to 3–2 up against Argentina in the final. At the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Okocha played for a disappointing Super Eagles side who failed to live up to expectations, again reaching the round of 16, albeit with less impressive performances save for their 3–2 opening win against Spain. This did not destroy interest in Okocha, who had entertained fans with his trademark skills and dribbles and went on to be named in the squad of the tournament.

Okocha again joined the Super Eagles in the 2000 African Cup of Nations, which Nigeria co-hosted with Ghana. He scored three goals in the tournament, two in the opening game against Tunisia, and was given a standing ovation by the nearly 60,000 in attendance when he left the field. The Super Eagles then went all the way to the final against Cameroon, with Okocha captaining his side and scoring the equaliser to tie the game 2–2 before losing in the penalty shootout at the end of extra time. He then captained the Super Eagles to the following 2002, 2004 and 2006, consecutively finishing all three tournaments in third place.

He made a return to the Super Eagles for a testimonial against an African select side in Warri. The game featured former players Daniel Amokachi, Alloysius Agu, John Fashanu, Benjani and Sulley Muntari. Nigeria won the match 2–1 with Okocha scoring the winning goal after appearing for the side in the second half. In March 2004, he was named one of the top 125 living footballers by Pelé.

==Style of play==
A quick, talented, agile, and skilful playmaker, Okocha usually played as an attacking midfielder, and is widely considered by pundits internationally as the best Nigerian footballer ever, and as one of the best African players of all time. Okocha was known for his confidence and clever trickery with the ball, technique, creativity, flair, close control, and smooth dribbling skills, as well as his turn of pace and his use of feints, in particular his version of the stepover (nicknamed the Okocha stepover) and his trademark turns. In 2012, Allan Jiang of &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; rated Okocha as one of the greatest dribblers of all time. Due to his range of passing, Okocha was capable of creating chances for teammates; he was also known for his ability to produce long throw-ins. While not being particularly prolific or consistent in his finishing or goalscoring, Okocha, possessed a powerful shot from long range and was an effective free-kick taker, which saw him score some spectacular and ingenious goals through his career. Due to his skill and nickname, he was described as being &#x27;so good that they named him twice&#x27; (a line immortalised in a terrace chant while Okocha played for Bolton Wanderers). He is still remembered by Fenerbahçe fans as one of the legends of the club and the Turkish football league. In addition to being an inspiration for many other African footballers, such as Asamoah Gyan, Okocha also was a major influence on the playing style of several other footballers across the globe, including German playmaker Mesut Özil, as well Brazilian playmaker Ronaldinho, whom Okocha played alongside during their time together at Paris Saint-Germain. Okocha became known as the &quot;African Maradona&quot; in the media, due to his skill and decisive performances for his country. Despite his ability, however, he was also known for being inconsistent, and for his lack of tactical discipline on the pitch.

==Post-playing career==
In late 2014 Okocha was added to the FIFA football game series as a &quot;Legend&quot; which honours his years as a great footballer.

Okocha was elected as the Chair of the Delta State Football Association on 21 February 2015. In April 2015, he expressed his interest in becoming the president of the Nigeria Football Federation. 

On 15 May 2016, Okocha played in a charity match as part of &quot;Team John McGinlay&quot; against &quot;Team Tony Kelly&quot; at the Macron Stadium and scored a hat-trick in his team&#x27;s 6–2 win.

In June 2019, it was reported that Okocha had been charged with alleged money laundering in Scotland.

Okocha has served as a football pundit for African sports broadcaster, Supersports since 2019, providing analysis for major tournaments, including the African Cup of Nations and the European championships.

On 14 November 2021, Okocha played in a charity match as part of a team of Bolton Wanderers Legends against the current Bolton first team, with the match helping to raise money for the mother of Bolton player Gethin Jones, after she was diagnosed with motor neuron disease. The Bolton first team won 7–4, with Okocha scoring a penalty for the Legends team.

In an interview he told why he never played for big clubs like Real Madrid CF was because of wage issues and racism. He also told them that the money they offer him was like he was doing them a favor.

==Personal life==
Okocha is a member of the Anioma (western Igbo) community, a sub-group of the Igbo people. His older brother Emmanuel is also a former footballer who played for the Nigerian national team. He has a nephew, Alex Iwobi, who plays for Fulham and Nigeria.

<text>USS &quot;Floyd B. Parks&quot; (DD-884) was a in service with the United States Navy from 1945 to 1973. She was scrapped in 1974.

==Namesake==

Floyd Bruce Parks was born on 16 January 1911 in Salisbury, Missouri, the first child of James B. Parks and his wife Elizabeth Ann Bowman. James Parks was a widower with one son from his first marriage. Floyd Parks also had a younger brother, Billy Bowman Parks, born in 1921. Their father died on 3 February 1924. He enlisted in the United States Navy in 1928 and served two years aboard destroyers. In 1930, he received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy. Parks earned the infamous Black &quot;N&quot; award, given for major infractions, on a number of occasions. He sang in the Midshipman Choir and was a member of Annapolis&#x27; water polo team, also participating in football and swimming. He graduated in the upper third of his class of 1934, and chose a commission in United States Marine Corps. He was appointed a second lieutenant on 1 June and assigned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard for a year, before serving on the cruiser . In May 1936, he reported to Naval Air Station Pensacola for flight training. While swimming in the Gulf of Mexico, Parks and an enlisted man rescued a Marine private from drowning, winning commendation for his &quot;quick action, good judgment and swimming ability&quot;.

Parks was designated a Naval Aviator on 12 June 1937, and in August reported to Naval Air Station San Diego, California. The following year, he married Margaret Elizabeth Murray of El Paso, Texas. In June 1940, he was reassigned to NAS Pensacola as a flight instructor. In May 1941, he transferred to the First Marine Aircraft Wing, Fleet Marine Force, Quantico, Virginia, and trained as a dive bomber pilot. He remained in that assignment until March 1942, when he joined the Second Marine Aircraft Wing in San Diego for deployment to Midway Atoll.

He was promoted to the rank of Major on 8 May 1942, and given command of Marine Fighting Squadron 221 (VMF-221). The squadron was predominantly equipped with Brewster F2A-3 (Model B-439) fighter aircraft, supplemented by a handful of Grumman F4F-3 Wildcats, all handed down from U.S. Navy squadrons. More than half of the aviators assigned to Parks&#x27; unit were fresh from flight training in San Diego. Parks was killed in action on the first day of the Battle of Midway on 4 June 1942, while leading his squadron against a superior force of Japanese fighters and bombers attacking the island. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.
==History==
The destroyer was laid down by the Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas on 30 October 1944, launched on 31 March 1945 by Mrs. Floyd B. Parks, widow of Major Parks and commissioned on 31 July 1945.

&quot;Floyd B. Parks&quot; arrived at San Diego, her home port, 16 November 1945, and sailed 20 November for her first tour of duty in the Far East, patrolling the coast of China and operating in the Marianas Islands until her return to San Diego 11 February 1947. In the period prior to the outbreak of war in Korea, &quot;Floyd B. Parks&quot; twice more deployed to the Far East for duty with the US 7th Fleet, returning from her second such cruise 13 June 1950, just before the North Koreans crossed the 38th parallel. At once she prepared to return to duty as a standby at Pearl Harbor, available should war spread, returning to San Diego 20 August.

===Korean War===
&quot;Floyd B. Parks&quot; operated with the Seventh Fleet in support of United Nations Forces during the Korean War. She sailed from San Diego 19 February 1951 to join in United Nations operations in Korea. On 16 March she joined the fast carrier task force, screening them during air operations off the east coast as well as spending a total of 60 days in Wonsan Harbor on blockade and bombardment duty. She returned to San Diego 10 October 1951, and after west coast operations, sailed for duty in the Far East again 31 May 1952. Along with duty similar to that of her first war cruise, she patrolled in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.

===Cold War===
During her 1955 Far Eastern cruise, &quot;Floyd B. Parks&quot; took part in evacuation of the Dachen Islands during the First Taiwan Strait Crisis, and while in the Orient once more 11 March 1956, collided with the heavy cruiser , losing two men and a section of her bow. Skillful work by her crew saved their ship, and brought her safely into Naval Station Subic Bay for temporary repairs. Upon her return to Long Beach Naval Shipyard 14 May 1956, &quot;Floyd B. Parks&quot;&#x27; damaged bow was replaced with that of the uncompleted destroyer and after completion of repairs and installation of new equipment &quot;Floyd B. Parks&quot; returned to her west coast-Far East rotation through 1962. She then entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and underwent an extensive Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul until February 1963.

===Vietnam War===
During the Vietnam War, &quot;Floyd B. Parks&quot; served as plane guard for aircraft carriers on Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf, participated in Operation Sea Dragon, patrolled on search and rescue duties, and carried out naval gunfire support missions.

&quot;Floyd B. Parks&quot; was decommissioned on 2 July 1973, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 2 July 1973, and sold for scrapping on 29 April 1974.

<doc id="511813" wikidata="Q3336186" url="?curid=511813" title="Nashville Star">
<text>Nashville Star is an American reality television singing competition program that aired for six seasons, from 2003 to 2008. Its first five seasons aired on USA Network, while the last season aired on NBC. Its five seasons on USA made it the longest-running competition series on cable television at the time. In Canada, the show aired on CMT through season 5, but moved to E! beginning with season 6. CMT in the United States reaired each episode in season 6.

It was similar to &quot;American Idol&quot;, in that performers had to sing to impress both celebrity judges and the public via call-in and/or internet votes. Unlike &quot;American Idol&quot;, however, the performers were limited to country music. This restriction was relaxed for Season 6, allowing for the finalists to choose from many genres of music, but the songs were arranged to maintain a country sound.

The show is credited with jump-starting the careers of singers Buddy Jewell, Miranda Lambert, Chris Young, and Kacey Musgraves among others. A &quot;Nashville Star&quot;-themed gifts and souvenirs shop featuring local items and city souvenirs opened in July 2008 at Nashville International Airport, one month before the show&#x27;s final episode, and closed after over a decade.

==Show format==
===Comparisons to &quot;American Idol&quot;===
In a format nearly identical to the final round of &quot;American Idol&quot;, finalists performed one song per week individually and face criticism and/or praise from a panel of three judges. At the end of the show, voting opened to the viewing public, who cast votes by calling a toll-free telephone number or logging on to the show&#x27;s official website (texting was added as a voting option in 2008). The performer with the fewest votes was eliminated.

However, because &quot;Nashville Star&quot; aired only once per week, eliminations were not announced until the following week. The finalists who have not been eliminated are called in random order to the stage one by one to perform until there are only two remaining. At that point, one was called to perform and the other was eliminated for receiving the fewest votes from the previous week. The finalists did not know the order in which they would perform and had less than one minute to prepare once their names were called. No votes are tallied on the season finale.

Much like &quot;American Idol&quot;, the judges were present to offer criticism to the finalists in an attempt to sway the voting public. Unlike &quot;Idol&quot;, however, &quot;Nashville Star&quot;&#x27;s judges did not participate in the preliminary auditions (leaving that task to the show&#x27;s producers), but they did act as mentors to the finalists (beginning with the 2008 season). The audition process was not seen on-air on USA Network versions, except for the first season (2003 season), but portions of it was seen in a montage during the premiere of the NBC version. Beginning with the 2008 move to NBC, the judges did assist producers in narrowing the field from 50 to 12. Each season (except for 2005), the judges eliminated finalists based on consensus on the premiere episode without sending the vote to the public (the process continued for a few more episodes during the first two seasons).

Whereas &quot;American Idol&quot; generally elevated people off the street to stardom, &quot;Nashville Star&quot; finalists were usually already somehow involved in the country music industry, but may not have attained a record deal on a major label. Past finalists have included studio musicians, background singers, and independent artists. Finalists were usually songwriters, in addition to being singers. In each season, one episode was dedicated to songs written by the finalists. &quot;Nashville Star&quot; did not have the same age limits as &quot;American Idol&quot;, and performers in their 30s and 40s were finalists, although most were in their 20s.

&quot;Nashville Star&quot; always featured a live band, led by John Bohlinger.

====Appearing on both shows in the same season====
In 2006, several musicians appeared on both &quot;American Idol&quot; and &quot;Nashville Star&quot;. Kenny Rogers made appearances as a guest performer live on both shows within two weeks of each other. Also, Patti LaBelle appeared as a guest judge on &quot;Star&quot; one week after mentoring on &quot;Idol&quot;. David Foster did the same, although two weeks apart.

In 2007, five days after Jewel&#x27;s debut as the new host of &quot;Nashville Star&quot;, she appeared as a guest judge on the season premiere of &quot;American Idol&quot;. The &quot;Idol&quot; segments, however, were taped several weeks before she was named host of &quot;Nashville Star&quot;.

===Broadcast===
Regular episodes of &quot;Nashville Star&quot; ran for 60 minutes each. The show occasionally had a longer runtime (90 or 120 minutes), usually on season premieres and finales. The first three seasons featured nine episodes each. The series&#x27; run was cut to eight episodes beginning in 2006.

Finalists lived together for the entire run of the show. During the first two seasons, the finalists lived in a large house near Nashville&#x27;s Music Row. Beginning with the 2005 season, finalists shared a large suite at the Gaylord Opryland Resort &amp; Convention Center. Excerpts of the finalists&#x27; interaction with each other in their living environment were often edited into the show.

In addition, most episodes included an established country music act making a guest appearance to perform a song.

&quot;Nashville Star&quot; was produced by Reveille Productions and originated live (except for each season&#x27;s premiere episode, which was taped) from the now-demolished Acuff Theatre at the Opry Entertainment Complex in Nashville, Tennessee. The competition took place over the months of March and April in its first four seasons, though it moved to January and February for the 2007 season and to the summer months in 2008.

===Prizes===
The winner of &quot;Nashville Star&quot; received a recording contract (through Sony Music in Seasons 1 and 2, Universal South Records in Season 3, RCA Label Group in Season 4, and Warner Bros. Music in Seasons 5 and 6), a performance on the Grand Ole Opry, and a pickup truck (Chevrolet from 2005–2007, Toyota in 2008). The 2008 season was to also award the winner a performance at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, though that was later canceled. The top four finalists each season were involved in &quot;The Nashville Star Tour&quot;, in which they performed together on a tour of small venues for a few months following the season.

==Criticisms==
&quot;Nashville Star&quot; was criticized from its inception as being an &quot;American Idol&quot; ripoff, but the show outlived many critics&#x27; initial predictions of failure.

Fifth-season judge Blake Shelton told the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;I think it&#x27;s disastrous that there hasn&#x27;t been a winner to go on to be a consistent star in Nashville. In order for the show to have credibility and for it to take another step, we need a Carrie Underwood to come out of it.&quot; Despite this, the show was a ratings hit for USA Network, and was moved to broadcast network television after five seasons.

==Controversies==
In 2004, Mal Rodgers was eliminated by the judges during one of the early rounds, despite being an obvious fan-favorite (at this time, two finalists were eliminated each episode: one by the judges, one by fan-vote). At the taping, the audience loudly booed the decision to eliminate Rodgers, continuing after the show had gone off-air. For 2005, the elimination process was altered, completely removing the judges from the equation. The process was again altered in 2006, allowing judges to remove one finalist (two in 2007, back to one in 2008) on the premiere episode only before fans get the chance to vote.

In 2005, finalist Tamika Tyler blamed producers for attempting to influence fans to vote against her, after she was voted off on an early-season episode. Tyler claims that video clips of a confrontation between her and eventual winner Erika Jo concerning the difference in their ages were doctored and taken out of context as they were presented on the show. The show&#x27;s producers would refute the claims; however, in 2006, the focus of the videos shifted from interactions between finalists to a behind-the-scenes look at each finalist preparing for his or her performance.

During the fifth episode of the 2007 season, no finalist was eliminated. However, host Jewel teased an elimination several times from the beginning of the episode, only to reveal at the very end that the previous week&#x27;s show experienced &quot;technical difficulties&quot; and the voting results were discarded. Neither USA Network nor Reveille Productions, would comment publicly on the &quot;technical difficulties&quot;. Had the show eliminated a finalist that week, the finale episode would have only featured two performers, instead of the usual three.

As stated below and on this page, the winner of season 6 was supposed to perform at the closing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, which was also shown on NBC in the U.S. However, that performance did not occur; no reason was ever given for the cancellation.

==Hosts==
The host for the first two seasons of &quot;Nashville Star&quot; was entertainment reporter Nancy O&#x27;Dell, who also served as a consulting producer. Before the third season (2005), USA Network announced the show would move from Saturday nights to a more desirable prime time slot on Tuesday nights. As a result of the move, O&#x27;Dell chose to leave the show due to her hosting commitments at &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;, which is taped in Los Angeles. Since then, the show has had a different host each year, consisting of hit-making country singers.

==Judges==
The show has seen a revolving door of judges as well, with recording industry executive Anastasia Brown serving the longest (a three-season stint from 2005–2007). 2008 marked the first time a recording industry executive was not a member of the panel, and also the first time judges co-acted as mentors.

A Weekly guest judges during 2006 mostly included bona fide musicians, but also included comedian Larry the Cable Guy and wrestler John Cena who both appeared in character for promotional consideration.

==Winners==
==Season 1 (2003)==
Season 1 was broadcast on USA Network and presented by Nancy O&#x27;Dell. Judges were country music historian Robert K. Oermann, record label executive Tracy Gershon, and singer/songwriter Charlie Robison.

The standings for 2003 were:

The first winner of &quot;Nashville Star&quot;, in the spring of 2003, was 41-year-old Buddy Jewell. On the strength of his win, Jewell&#x27;s self-titled album released via Columbia Records earned him a gold record and two top-five country hits in &quot;Help Pour Out the Rain (Lacey&#x27;s Song)&quot; and &quot;Sweet Southern Comfort&quot;, both at No. 3. With the release of a second album, &quot;Times Like These&quot;, Jewell saw declining sales and was dropped from the label. That season&#x27;s runner-up, John Arthur Martinez, has released several independently produced albums, and one under a major banner.

Miranda Lambert finished third. Her debut album, &quot;Kerosene&quot;, debuted on the Billboard country albums chart at No. 1 upon its 2005 release, and with a platinum certification from the RIAA, it is the best-selling album from a &quot;Nashville Star&quot; contestant. Her second album, &quot;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend&quot;, is certified platinum too and has produced three more Top 20 hits, one of which (&quot;Gunpowder &amp; Lead&quot;) reached No. 7 in 2008. Her third album, &quot;Revolution&quot;, which is also certified platinum, gave her her first No. 1 &quot;The House That Built Me&quot;. At the 2010 Academy of Country Music Awards, Lambert won three awards, including Top Female Vocalist, Video of the Year for &#x27;White Liar&#x27; and Album of the Year for &#x27;Revolution&#x27;. She has also been named Female Vocalist of the Year at the Academy of Country Music Awards and Country Music Association Awards for seven consecutive years (2010 to 2016). She is widely considered to be the most successful contestant in the history of the show; although Season 4 winner Chris Young has more No. 1 country singles (nine) than Lambert (four), Lambert has more No. 1 country albums (six) than Young (two).

==Season 2 (2004)==
Nancy O&#x27;Dell returned as host. Record label executive Tracy Gershon returned as a judge, joined by radio personality Billy Greenwood and country artists The Warren Brothers. The show was broadcast on USA Network.

The standings for 2004 were:

&quot;Nashville Star&quot; began its second season on March 6, 2004. In 2004, the winner was 33-year-old Brad Cotter, who enjoyed very limited success after his win. Cotter was one of ten finalists eliminated by the judges on the first episode, but was allowed back into the competition after he was selected by viewers to be the one of those ten saved. The format was changed after the 2004 season and that element of the competition was scrapped.

Cotter won a recording contract with Sony Music on its Epic Records label. His first album, &quot;Patient Man,&quot; performed poorly, selling less than 140,000 copies. He was subsequently dropped from the roster. Cotter remains on tour opening for other country artists, such as Mark Chesnutt and Restless Heart.

However, runner-up George Canyon (also 33 years old) experienced a result similar to Miranda Lambert. He did not win a record deal from the show and has not achieved success in the U.S., but he has become a country music star in his native Canada, where he was signed by Universal Music and has released three successful albums.

Following the season, third-place finisher Matt Lindahl began appearing in television, radio, billboard, and print advertisements for Purity Dairies, a regional dairy company based in Nashville. In the television and radio ads, Lindahl (along with his band) sings, acts, and plays the washboard - an instrument that he also played on &quot;Nashville Star&quot;.

In 2007, Lance Miller signed with Warner Bros. Records and appeared on &quot;Star&quot; to perform his first single.

Sixth-place finisher Brent Keith was a top 36 semi-finalist on the eighth season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, but was not voted through to the finals.

==Season 3 (2005)==
&quot;Nashville Star&quot; began its third season on March 1, 2005. The host was LeAnn Rimes and Cledus T. Judd was co-host, but credited as &quot;Special Correspondent&quot;. Sara Evans substituted for Rimes during episodes 7 and 8 due to vocal cord injury. Judges were singer/songwriter Phil Vassar, record label executive Anastasia Brown, and singer/songwriter (and Poison frontman) Bret Michaels.

The standings for 2005 were:

The 2005 winner was 18-year-old Erika Jo from Mount Juliet, Tennessee — the first female and youngest overall winner. Her victory was watched by the show&#x27;s largest-ever USA Network audience, when over three million people tuned in to see the finale on April 26. It marked the first time the show ranked among the top ten cable shows of the week.

Erika Jo&#x27;s self-titled album debuted at No. 5 on the country album charts, but quickly fell out of the top ten, selling just over 118,000 copies in the year following its release. The video for the first single, &quot;I Break Things&quot;, initially received heavy rotation on CMT and GAC, but the song was largely ignored by country radio and only reached No. 53 on the Billboard Magazine country charts. One subsequent single (a cover of Jessi Colter&#x27;s 1975 hit &quot;I&#x27;m Not Lisa&quot;) was released, but it also failed to attract substantial attention. She was later dropped from the Universal South roster. Erika Jo occasionally appeared on the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; shortly following her victory.

Second-place finisher Jason Meadows released an album &quot;100% Cowboy&quot; via the independent Baccerstick label in 2008, and although the album charted, none of its three singles did. Fourth place Jayron Weaver went on to form with Delnora Reed a duo named Blue-Eyed Grass.

==Season 4 (2006)==
Wynonna was the host of the series and Cowboy Troy was co-host. Two Foot Fred hosts &quot;Small Talk&quot; segment.

Phil Vassar and Anastasia Brown returned as regular judges, with a third seat occupied by guest judges, which included:
*Premiere (3/14/06) - Big &amp; Rich
*Week 2 (3/21/06) - comedian Larry the Cable Guy
*Week 3 (3/28/06) - World Wrestling Entertainment star John Cena
*Week 4 (4/4/06) - Naomi Judd
*Week 5 (4/11/06) - David Foster
*Week 6 (4/18/06) - Patti LaBelle
*Week 7 (4/25/06) - Scott Weiland &amp; Duff McKagan (of Velvet Revolver)
*Finale (5/2/06) - Big &amp; Rich

The standings for 2006 were:

The 2006 winner was 20-year-old Chris Young. &quot;Nashville Star&quot; began its fourth season on March 14, 2006, with a slightly altered set, two new hosts in Wynonna &amp; Cowboy Troy, and only two regular judges. A guest judge occupied the third seat each week. The format remained unaltered, though the length of the season was reduced by one week, and one finalist was eliminated on the season premiere (by judges&#x27; decision) to compensate. Two Foot Fred&#x27;s &quot;Small Talk&quot; segment also made its debut in 2006. The season ended on May 2, 2006, with Young—from nearby Murfreesboro, Tennessee—crowned champion. His self-titled debut album was released on October 3, 2006, and debuted at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart, although its singles both missed Top 40. Young charted in the Top 40 for the first time in 2008 with &quot;Voices&quot;, and reached number one in 2009 with &quot;Gettin&#x27; You Home (The Black Dress Song)&quot; and &quot;The Man I Want to Be&quot;. &quot;Voices&quot; was then re-released in 2010 and also went on to reach number one. Young also received a Grammy nomination in 2016 for &quot;Think of You&quot; with &quot;The Voice&quot; contestant Cassadee Pope. Sixth-place finisher Kristen McNamara was a top 36 finalist on the eighth season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, but was not voted into the Top 13. Fourth-place finisher Matt Mason would go on to win the first season of &quot;CMT&#x27;s Next Superstar&quot;.

==Season 5 (2007)==
Jewel hosted the show and Cowboy Troy returned as co-host. Two Foot Fred returned as host of the &quot;Small Talk&quot; segment. Judges included Anastasia Brown, who returned for her third season at the desk. Joining her were country singers Randy Owen (lead singer of Alabama) and Blake Shelton.

The standings for 2007 were:


The above ten were chosen from over fifty Regional Finalists, selected from local area callbacks and auditions. The Regional Finals were held in Nashville, TN, on November 1-3, 2006, at The Stage.

The 2007 winner of &quot;Nashville Star&quot; was 29-year-old Angela Hacker from Muscle Shoals, Alabama, who finished just ahead of her younger brother, Zac. It was the first time that siblings had competed, let alone finished in the top two.

The fifth season debuted on USA Network and CMT Canada at 10 pm EST on January 11, 2007. There were several changes to the show, including an earlier start date and a new night. The series moved to January and February, and aired live on Thursdays at 10 pm EST rather than Tuesdays. Jewel replaced Wynonna as host, with Cowboy Troy returning as co-host. The format remained mostly unaltered, except the judges eliminated two finalists (one male, one female) on the premiere episode. Sonic Drive-In was the presenting sponsor for 2007. The season finale aired on March 1, 2007.

Following the season, Angela Hacker&#x27;s album &quot;The Winner Is Angela Hacker&quot; was released on Warner Bros. Records. The album, composed of cover song demos she recorded while on the show, was only available at Walmart. She also appeared on Cowboy Troy&#x27;s &quot;Black in the Saddle&quot; album, singing guest vocals on &quot;Hick Chick&quot;. She left Warner in August 2008 without releasing any singles.

Fifth-placer Whitney Duncan, who had previously charted the duet &quot;My World Is Over&quot; with Kenny Rogers in 2004, signed to Warner as well, charting with &quot;When I Said I Would&quot;. Her debut album, &quot;Right Road Now&quot;, was first slated for release in mid-2008, but was delayed repeatedly due to poor performance of its singles. It was eventually released in early 2010, and Duncan soon after parted ways with the record label. Duncan would later compete in the CBS reality series &quot;&quot; and finished in 9th place. She would later participate in another CBS reality series &quot;The Amazing Race 25&quot;, with her fellow &quot;Survivor&quot; contestant and fiancé Keith Tollefson; they finished in 8th place.

Kacey Musgraves, who finished in seventh place, signed with Mercury Records in 2012 and released her debut single, &quot;Merry Go &#x27;Round&quot;, which was a top 20 country hit. Her major-label debut, &quot;Same Trailer Different Park&quot;, was released on March 19, 2013. It reached number 1 on the country albums chart and number 2 on the Billboard 200, and won the Academy of Country Music award for Album of the Year, and also the Grammy Award for Best Country Album. Her second major-label release, &quot;Pageant Material&quot; (2015), was nominated for Best Country Album at the 58th Grammy Awards. Her first Christmas-themed album, &quot;A Very Kacey Christmas&quot;, was released on October 28, 2016. Her fourth studio album, &quot;Golden Hour&quot; (2018), won four Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Best Country Album.

==Season 6 (2008)==
In Season 6, the show moved from USA Network to NBC. The move to NBC (and E! in Canada) came with a few format changes to the show, including the first time that auditions were shown on-air. Also, the on-screen judges presided over the initial auditions for the first time. The minimum age was lowered to 16 (from 18), and duos and trios were allowed to compete. The field was expanded to twelve finalists (groups counted as one finalist), the largest field since Season 1. The show also received a new set, opening, and theme song. Beginning with the second episode, the show was broadcast in HDTV for the first time; the premiere retained the NTSC format.

Season 6 of &quot;Nashville Star&quot; premiered on NBC on June 9, 2008, at 9PM Eastern/Pacific. Its heavily-promoted first broadcast, a two-hour premiere, earned a 2.2 rating, its first hour finishing fourth and its second hour finishing second among the four major networks. Despite the relatively low ratings for a network show, the premiere attracted the most viewers for a single episode in the show&#x27;s history, outdrawing all episodes broadcast on USA Network. The second episode lost 18 percent of its debut audience. The show during season 6 placed fourth in the first hour and placed second overall in the second hour of the broadcast. Billy Ray Cyrus hosted the sixth season. The winner of the first-ever NBC season was 32-year-old Melissa Lawson.

The finalists for 2008 were:
The sixth season featured judges Jeffrey Steele, John Rich, and Jewel (who hosted Season Five). For the first time, the judges also acted as mentors to the finalists, and Rich produced songs later included in the EP, United We Stand. The winner was promised a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records, a Toyota Tundra pickup truck, and the opportunity to perform at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

The sixth season also brought &quot;Nashville Star&quot; to the American CMT network for the first time. The cable network rebroadcast each episode the following Friday. Beginning with the show&#x27;s second episode, CMT&#x27;s Katie Cook joined the show as a correspondent.

For the first time in the show&#x27;s history, a companion radio show was developed to complement the television program. &quot;Nashville Star Radio&quot; debuted each Thursday evening on XM&#x27;s &quot;Highway 16&quot;. &quot;NSR&quot; featured the week&#x27;s performances from the television show, as well as exclusive in-studio performances and interviews with the finalists and judges.

AT&amp;T became a major sponsor of the show, placing their logo on screen with each finalist&#x27;s call-in vote line. AT&amp;T sponsored the same service on &quot;American Idol&quot;. Also, Toyota replaced Chevrolet as a sponsor, and offered its signature Tundra pickup as a prize to the winner.

Guest Performers for the 2008 season included Taylor Swift, Trace Adkins, Danity Kane, and Blake Shelton.

Thirty-two-year-old Melissa Lawson won. Lawson had made it to the Top 75 on season 4 of American Idol. She released a single &quot;What If It All Goes Right&quot; that charted at No. 43 on the US Country charts and No. 79 on the general US chart. Second-placed Gabe Garcia, went on to form the Gabe Garcia Band.

Coffey Anderson (also written Cofféy Anderson), a Los Angeles, California, resident but originally from Bangs, Texas, finished 4th. He had briefly been a contestant on season 2 of American Idol in 2003, making it to the Hollywood round. Coffey Anderson has released four albums: &quot;Southern Man&quot;, &quot;Me and You&quot; and the spiritual Christian albums &quot;Inspiration Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;Worship Unplugged 1&quot;. He enjoys huge popularity online, particularly with his compositions &quot;Memphis&quot;, &quot;Southern Man&quot;, &quot;Rock &#x27;n Roll Sally&quot;, &quot;All Ye&quot;, &quot;Let me Love You&quot; and &quot;Can I&quot;. He also has his own indie label Coffey Entertainment, LLC.

Third-placer Shawn Mayer is currently releasing songs digitally, and fifth-placer Ashlee Hewitt is currently songwriting and working with close friend and fellow country singer Katie Armiger.

With the release of &quot;Teddy Gentry&#x27;s Best New Nashville&quot; through the Cracker Barrel music program in all 601 Cracker Barrel locations in 42 states, sixth-placer Laura Fedor becomes the first-ever non-major-label-signed artist to be allowed in their music program, and the only artist besides the winner to have a prominent national release on a respected label.

<text>Sigma Octantis is a solitary star in the Octans constellation that forms the pole star of the Southern Hemisphere. Its name is also written as σ Octantis, abbreviated as Sigma Oct or σ Oct, and it is officially named Polaris Australis (). The star is positioned one degree away from the southern celestial pole of the Southern Hemisphere, lying in nearly opposite direction to the North Star on the celestial sphere.

Located approximately from Earth, it is classified as a subgiant with a spectral type of F0 IV. Sigma Octantis has an apparent magnitude of 5.5, but is slightly variable and is classified as a Delta Scuti variable.

== Nomenclature ==
&quot;σ Octantis&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Sigma Octantis&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation.

As the southern hemisphere&#x27;s pole star it bore the name &quot;Polaris Australis&quot;, first applied in the 1700s. In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name &quot;Polaris Australis&quot; for this star on 5 September 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names. It is the southernmost named star.

==Properties==
With a spectral class of F0IV, Sigma Octantis appears to be a subgiant, although it has also been classified as F0III. Evolutionary models place it at the very end of its main sequence life with an age of about 900 million years. It has expanded somewhat to a size 4.4 that of the Sun and emits 44 times as much electromagnetic radiation from its photosphere at an effective temperature of .

Sigma Octantis is a Delta Scuti variable, varying by about 0.03 magnitudes every 2.33 hours. It is thought to pulsate only in the fundamental mode.

==Southern pole star==
Sigma Octantis is the current southern pole star, whose counterpart is Polaris, the current North Star. To an observer in the southern hemisphere, Sigma Octantis appears almost motionless and all the other stars in the Southern sky appear to rotate around it. It is part of a small &quot;half hexagon&quot; shape. It is slightly more than a degree away from the true south pole, and the south celestial pole is moving away from it due to precession of the equinoxes.

At magnitude +5.42, Sigma Octantis is barely visible to the naked eye, making it unusable for navigation, especially by comparison with the much brighter and more easily visible Polaris.
Because of this, the constellation Crux is often preferred for determining the position of the South Celestial Pole.
Once Sigma Octantis&#x27; approximate position has been determined, either by the major stars in Octans or using the Southern Cross (Crux) method, it can be positively verified using an asterism: Sigma, Chi, Tau, and Upsilon Octantis are all stars of around magnitude 5.6, and form the distinctive shape of a trapezoid.

== In astrometrics ==
Sigma Octantis was used as a reference to measure the magnitudes of stars in the southern hemisphere for the 1908 Revised Harvard Photometry catalogue. The Pole Star and Lambda Ursae Minoris were used for the northern hemisphere. It was then noted that &quot;Neither of these stars appears to vary perceptibly&quot; but that, due to the procedures used &quot;if they did, the variation would have no effect on the final measures.&quot;

== In culture ==

Sigma Octantis is the dimmest star to be represented on a national flag. It appears on the flag of Brazil, symbolising the Brazilian Federal District.

<doc id="511818" wikidata="Q847304" url="?curid=511818" title="Fitzroya">
<text>Fitzroya is a monotypic genus in the cypress family. The single living species, Fitzroya cupressoides, is a tall, long-lived conifer native to the Andes mountains and coastal regions of southern Chile, and only to the Argentine Andes, where it is an important member of the Valdivian temperate forests. Common names include lawal (in Mapudungun, Hispanicized as lahual), alerce (, &quot;larch&quot; in Spanish), and Patagonian cypress. The genus was named in honour of Robert FitzRoy.

The genus is ancient with it dating back to the Cretaceous of South America. Fossils are also known from the Paleogene of Tasmania, Australia (particularly from the now extinct &quot;Fitzroya tasmanensis&quot;). 
==Description==
&quot;Fitzroya cupressoides&quot; is the largest tree species in South America, normally growing to 40–60 m, but occasionally more than 70 m, and up to 5 m in trunk diameter. Its rough pyramidal canopy provides cover for the southern beech, laurel and myrtle. The largest known living specimen is Alerce Milenario in Alerce Costero National Park, Chile. It is more than 60 m tall, with a trunk diameter of 4.26 m. Much larger specimens existed before the species was heavily logged in the 19th and 20th centuries; Charles Darwin reported finding a specimen of 12.6m circumference (some 4.01m in diameter).

The leaves are in decussate whorls of three, 3–6 mm long (to 8 mm long on seedlings) and 2 mm broad, marked with two white stomatal lines. This is a dioecious species, with male and female cones on separate trees. The cones are globose, 6–8 mm in diameter, opening flat to 12 mm across, with nine scales in three whorls of three. Only the central whorl of scales is fertile, bearing 2–3 seeds on each scale; the lower and upper whorls are small and sterile. The seeds are 2–3 mm long and flat, with a wing along each side. The seeds mature 6–8 months after pollination.

The thick bark of &quot;F. cupressoides&quot; may be an adaptation to wildfire.

In 1993 a specimen from Chile, &quot;Gran Abuelo&quot; or &quot;Alerce Milenario&quot;, was found to be 3622 years old, making it the second oldest fully verified (by counting growth rings) age for any living tree species, after the bristlecone pine. More recent research proposed that this individual corresponds to the oldest tree in the world.

A team of researchers from the University of Tasmania found fossilized foliage of a &quot;Fitzroya&quot; species on the Lea River of northwest Tasmania. The 35-million-year-old (Oligocene) fossil was named &quot;F. tasmanensis&quot;. The finding demonstrates the ancient floristic affinities between Australasia and southern South America, which botanists identify as the Antarctic flora.

About 40 to 50 thousand years ago, during the interstadials of the Llanquihue glaciation, &quot;Fitzroya&quot; and other conifers had a much larger and continuous geographical extent than at present including the eastern lowlands of Chiloé Island and the area west of Llanquihue Lake. At present &quot;Fitzroya&quot; grow mainly at some altitude above sea level. &quot;Fitzroya&quot; stands near sea level are most likely relicts.

==History==
&quot;Fitzroya cupressoides&quot; wood has been found in the site of Monte Verde, implying that it has been used since at least 13,000 years before present. The Huilliche people are known to have used the wood for making tools and weapons. Its high durability despite its light weight is ideal for roof shingles which can last longer than ordinary zinc counterparts.

By the time of the Spanish conquest of Chiloé Archipelago in 1567 most of the islands were covered by dense forest where &quot;F. cupressoides&quot; grew. The wood was economically important in colonial Chiloé and Valdivia, which exported planks to Peru. A single tree could yield 600 planks with a width of at least 0.5 m and a length of 5 m. The wood was highly valued in Chile and Peru for its elasticity and lightness. With the destruction of Valdivia in 1599 Chiloé gained increased importance as the only locale that could supply the Viceroyalty of Peru with &quot;F. cupressoides&quot; wood, the first large shipment of which left Chiloé in 1641.

&quot;Fitzroya cupressoides&quot; wood was the principal means of exchange in the trade with Peru, and even came to be used as a local currency, the real de alerce, in Chiloé Archipelago. It has been argued that the Spanish exclave of Chiloé prevailed over other Spanish settlements in Southern Chile due to the importance of alerce trade.

From about 1750 to 1943, when the land between Maullín River and Valdivia was colonized by Spain and then Chile, numerous fires of &quot;Fitzroya&quot; woods occurred in Cordillera Pelada. These fires were initiated by Spaniards, Chileans and Europeans. Earlier, from 1397 to 1750 the &quot;Fitzroya&quot; woods of Cordillera Pelada also suffered from fires that originated from lightning strikes and indigenous inhabitants.
In the 1850s and 1860s Vicente Pérez Rosales burned down huge tracts of forested lands to provide cleared lands for German settlers in Southern Chile. The area affected by the fires of Pérez Rosales spanned a strip in the Andean foothills from Bueno River to Reloncaví Sound. One of the most famous intentional fires was the one of the &quot;Fitzroya&quot; forests between Puerto Varas and Puerto Montt in 1863. This burning was done taking advantage of a drought in 1863. Burnings of forest were in many cases necessary for the survival of the settlers who had no means of subsistence other than agriculture.

Logging of &quot;Fitzroya&quot; continued until 1976 when it became forbidden by law, (with the exception of already dead trees and with the authorization of CONAF, a National Corporation) although illegal logging still occasionally occurs.

<text>USS &quot;John R. Craig&quot; (DD-885) was a in service with the United States Navy from 1945 to 1979. She was sunk as a target in June 1980.

==History==
===Namesake and commissioning===
The destroyer was named for Lieutenant Commander John R. Craig. Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Craig graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1930 and received flight training the following year. During 1935 and 1936 he underwent submarine training. Prior to the outbreak of World War II, he commanded . He took command of on 16 September 1942. During the next 6 months he led the submarine on high risk attacks against Japanese shipping. While on her sixth war patrol, &quot;Grampus&quot; was lost in the Southwest Pacific with all hands on 22 March 1943. He was declared dead on 23 March 1944. Craig was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously for his extraordinary heroism.

&quot;John R. Craig&quot; was laid down by the Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas, on 17 November 1944. &quot;John R. Craig&quot; was launched on 14 April 1945 by Mrs. Lilian Hyde Craig, Craig&#x27;s widow, and commissioned on 20 August 1945.

After shakedown in Caribbean &quot;John R. Craig&quot;, departed Charleston, South Carolina on 19 January 1946 for Naval Station San Diego, arriving 1 February. On 7 February it left to join the United States Seventh Fleet and assist in repatriating Japanese soldiers from North China. The destroyer returned San Diego on 31 January 1947. In the years prior to the Korean conflict it alternated Far Eastern deployments with periods of training off the California coast.

===Korean War===
In the lead-up to the Korean War, the USS Craig was dispatched to Jeju Island to enforce a naval blockade, preventing insurgents from obtaining mainland help. (see: Jeju Uprising) On May 19, Colonel Rothwell Brown was designated the supreme military commander on Jeju island and tasked with suppressing the revolt, declaring “I’m not interested in the cause of the uprising. My mission is to crack down only.” The crackdown would ultimately end in more than 30,000 dead, including more than 14,000 civilians.

After the Korean War broke out, &quot;John R. Craig&quot; arrived in the combat zone on 19 February 1951. She immediately commenced operations with Task Force 77, screening aircraft carrier strikes on enemy shore positions. During the Chinese spring offensive the destroyer performed shore bombardment in the Wonsan area, knocking out enemy installations and disrupting transportation. But for two brief periods in San Diego, she continued operations off Korea during the remainder of the conflict.

===Cold War===
Following the cessation of hostilities in July 1953, &quot;John R. Craig&quot; continued patrol operations south of the 38th parallel. From 1954 to 1962 the destroyer engaged in exercises off the West Coast with annual deployments to the Far East. During her 1955 cruise she took an active part in the evacuation of Chinese nationalists from the Dachen Islands during the First Taiwan Strait Crisis. Subsequent cruises consisted of exercises with the Japanese Self Defense Force in 1957, anti-submarine warfare exercises, Taiwan Strait patrol and maneuvers with the Republic of China Navy during the 1961 cruise.

She arrived San Diego 6 March 1962 and underwent an extensive Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul at the Hunter&#x27;s Point Naval Shipyard at San Francisco, California, between 6 March 1962 and 15 March 1963.

===Vietnam War===
During the Vietnam War, &quot;John R. Craig&quot; served as a plane guard for aircraft carriers on Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf, participated in Operation Sea Dragon, patrolled on search and rescue duties, and carried out naval gunfire support missions. While responding to a mayday on 28–29 July 1965 in the Da Nang area, &quot;John R. Craig&quot; supported U.S. Marine and Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) units with naval gunfire support. At night with danger close, she fired 348 5-inch rounds, preventing the overrun of 3rd Platoon, Hotel Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines on and near the beach as well as two platoons of the ARVN 2nd Regional Force by a larger Viet Cong (VC) unit. In doing so she effectively destroyed the 7th VC Battalion engaging Marines on the Ca De River Bridge and the northern sector of Da Nang.

On 9 April 1972 while supporting ARVN and American units close to the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone, the &quot;John R. Craig&quot; took North Vietnamese artillery fire, using 105 mm howitzers captured from the ARVN. Hundreds of artillery shells fell around her and she was struck by numerous fragments as well as five direct hits which started several fires. One hit at the waterline flooded a compartment with of water, and was dead in the water until the electrical systems and power could be restored. After a quick fix with a soft patch at Da Nang she returned to fight and support allied units the next day, again receiving enemy fire, but did not take any hits.

===Naval Reserve===
With newer destroyers coming on the scene during the Vietnam War, &quot;John R. Craig&quot; was assigned to United States Naval Reserve training at San Diego, California, in 1973. During this time the ship provided naval gunfire support for Naval Gunfire Liaison Officer training, performed plane guard duties for carrier training, and conducted goodwill cruises to ports on the United States West Coast. She made cruises to Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; Everett, Washington; San Francisco, California; Long Beach, California; Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia; Eureka, California; and Ensenada, Mexico.

&quot;John R. Craig&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 27 July 1979 and sunk as a target off California on 6 June 1980.

<doc id="511828" wikidata="Q7872490" url="?curid=511828" title="USS Orleck">
<text>USS &quot;Orleck&quot; (DD-886), is a that was in service with the United States Navy from 1945 to 1982. In October 1982 she was sold to Turkey and renamed &quot;Yücetepe&quot; (D 345). After her final decommissioning the Turkish government transferred &quot;Yücetepe&quot; to the Southeast Texas War Memorial and Heritage Foundation at Orange, Texas, where she was berthed as a museum ship. The Orleck Foundation then decided to move the ship to the Calcasieu River in Lake Charles, Louisiana. On 26 March 2022, she arrived in Jacksonville, FL, where she served as a Naval Museum on the downtown riverfront until 3 April 2023, when she docked to its permanent home at the Shipyards West.

==Namesake==
Joseph Orleck was born on 22 January 1906 in Columbus, Ohio. He enlisted in the Navy on 23 June 1924. Rising through the enlisted ranks, he was warranted Boatswain on 14 December 1938, and appointed Ensign on 15 June 1942. He assumed command of on 28 May 1943 with the rank of Lieutenant. He went down with his ship after a Luftwaffe bomber attack in the Gulf of Salerno on 9 September 1943. A recipient of the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for rescue work during the Casablanca invasion, he was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his firefighting and flood control efforts to prevent total loss of his ship during the Salerno assault.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Orleck&quot; was laid down by the Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas, on 28 November 1944, launched on 12 May 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Joseph Orleck, widow of Lieutenant Orleck, and commissioned on 15 September 1945. Her original cost was US$6,313,000.

==Service history==

===United States Navy (1945–1982)===
On 14 November 1947, &quot;Orleck&quot; collided with the submarine while &quot;Bugara&quot; was making a submerged practice attack against her in the Pacific Ocean off Southern California.
&quot;Orleck&quot; operated with the United States Seventh Fleet in support of United Nations forces during the Korean War, then it underwent an extensive FRAM I overhaul in 1962. On 7 June 1965, &quot;Orleck&quot; assisted in the recovery of the Gemini IV space capsule.

During the Vietnam War, &quot;Orleck&quot; served as plane guard for aircraft carriers on &quot;Yankee Station&quot; in the Gulf of Tonkin, participated in &quot;Operation Sea Dragon&quot;, patrolled on search and rescue duties, and carried out naval gunfire support missions.

&quot;Orleck&quot; was decommissioned on 1 October 1982 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 6 August 1987.

===Turkish Navy (1982–2000)===
&quot;Orleck&quot; was transferred to Turkey for service in the Turkish Navy. She was renamed TCG Yücetepe (D 345) in Turkish service.

===Museum ship (since 2000)===
On 12 August 2000, the Turkish government transferred &quot;Yücetepe&quot; to the Southeast Texas War Memorial and Heritage Foundation at Orange, Texas, for use as a memorial and museum under her old name, USS &quot;Orleck&quot;.

When Hurricane Rita struck the Texas coast in September 2005, &quot;Orleck&quot; was severely damaged. After repairs, &quot;Orleck&quot; was ready to return to her pier at Ochiltree-Inman Park; however, the City of Orange refused to allow her to return. &quot;Orleck&quot; was temporarily relocated to Levingston Island, then moored north of Orange Harbor Island.

On 6 May 2009, the Lake Charles, Louisiana, City Council voted in favor of an ordinance authorizing the city to enter into a Cooperative Endeavor Agreement with USS &quot;Orleck&quot;. On 20 May 2010 it moved to Lake Charles, Louisiana. The grand opening in Lake Charles occurred on 10 April 2011. In 2019, the ship was either going to be moved, sunk, or scrapped; however, the museum remained operational.

In 2019, following the failure of the USS &quot;Adams&quot; Association and the Jacksonville Naval Museum to acquire the as a museum ship in Jacksonville, Florida, it was proposed to acquire &quot;Orleck&quot; and move her to the proposed berth that was obtained for the &quot;Charles F. Adams.&quot; The USS &quot;Adams&quot; Association studied &quot;Orleck&quot; and deemed that she would survive the tow from Lake Charles to Jacksonville.
On 30 August 2019, the Jacksonville Naval Museum announced that the transfer of &quot;Orleck&quot; to Jacksonville has been approved and are waiting on finalizing plans with the Jacksonville city council.

In February 2020, the move to Jacksonville was confirmed. She would remain open in Lake Charles until 1 March 2020, before closing in preparation for an inspection by the US Coast Guard for towing to dry dock in Texas for repairs before making the tow to Jacksonville.

The tow to Jacksonville was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. She broke loose from her mooring in the Calcasieu River during Hurricane Laura, drifting a mile down stream before drifting aground with some damage.

In August 2021, the Jacksonville City Council unanimously approved the ship to be moored in downtown Jacksonville.

In December 2021, she was towed from Lake Charles, Louisiana to Port Arthur, Texas to be drydocked. Over the next few weeks she was deemed to be in much better shape than expected and restoration work was done which extended the ship&#x27;s life by 15 years.

On 11 January 2022, ownership was officially transferred to the museum association in preparation for its tow and set-up in Jacksonville.

With restoration work completed, she passed all inspections by the US Coast Guard, on 17 March 2022, she left Port Arthur, Texas under tow to Jacksonville.

She arrived in Jacksonville on 26 March 2022 and officially opened on 5 October 2022.

<text>The Frontier Thesis, also known as Turner&#x27;s Thesis or American frontierism, is the argument by historian Frederick Jackson Turner in 1893 that the settlement and colonization of the rugged American frontier was decisive in forming the culture of American democracy and distinguishing it from European nations. He stressed the process of &quot;winning a wilderness&quot; to extend the frontier line further for U.S. colonization, and the impact this had on pioneer culture and character. Turner&#x27;s text takes the ideas behind Manifest Destiny and uses them to explain how American culture came to be. The features of this unique American culture included democracy, egalitarianism, uninterest in bourgeois or high culture, and an ever-present potential for violence. &quot;American democracy was born of no theorist&#x27;s dream; it was not carried in the &quot;Susan Constant&quot; to Virginia, nor in the &quot;Mayflower&quot; to Plymouth. It came out of the American forest, and it gained new strength each time it touched a new frontier,&quot; wrote Turner.

In this view, the frontier experience established the distinctively American style of liberty contrasted to deferential European mindsets still affected by the expectations of feudalism. It eroded old, dysfunctional customs. Turner&#x27;s ideal of frontier had no need for standing armies, established churches, aristocrats, or nobles; there was no landed gentry who controlled the land or charged heavy rents and fees. Rather, pioneers went and claimed territory for themselves using only loose organizations, and the toughness of the experience gave them discipline and self-sufficiency that would be handed down over generations, even after the frontier advanced beyond the old boundaries. The Frontier Thesis was first published in a paper entitled &quot;The Significance of the Frontier in American History&quot;, delivered to the American Historical Association in 1893 in Chicago. He won wide acclaim among historians and intellectuals. Turner elaborated on the theme in his advanced history lectures and in a series of essays published over the next 25 years, published along with his initial paper as &quot;The Frontier in American History.&quot;

Turner&#x27;s emphasis on the importance of the frontier in shaping American character influenced the interpretation found in thousands of scholarly histories. By the time Turner died in 1932, 60% of the leading history departments in the U.S. were teaching courses in frontier history along Turnerian lines. It was not confined to academia, but rather was a popular and accepted view. For example, President John F. Kennedy described his programs in the 1960 election as a &quot;New Frontier&quot; to conquer, except meaning space and domestic issues. While this view remains reasonably common at a popular level, since the 1980s academic historians no longer hold to the Frontier Thesis, or only accept its most basic conclusions.

==Summary==
Turner begins the essay by calling to attention the fact that the western frontier line, which had defined the entirety of American history up to the 1880s, had ended. He elaborates by stating that,

According to Turner, American progress has repeatedly undergone a cyclical process on the frontier line as society has needed to redevelop with its movement westward. Everything in American history up to the 1880s somehow relates the western frontier, including slavery. In spite of this, Turner laments, the frontier has received little serious study from historians and economists.

The frontier line, which separates civilization from wilderness, is “the most rapid and effective Americanization” on the continent; it takes the European from across the Atlantic and shapes him into something new. American emigration west is not spurred by government incentives, but rather some &quot;expansive power&quot; inherent within them that seeks to dominate nature. Furthermore, there is a need to escape the confines of the State.

The most important aspect of the frontier to Turner is its effect on democracy. The frontier transformed Jeffersonian democracy into Jacksonian democracy. The individualism fostered by the frontier&#x27;s wilderness created a national spirit complementary to democracy, as the wilderness defies control. Therefore, Andrew Jackson&#x27;s brand of popular democracy was a triumph of the frontier.

Turner sets up the East and the West as opposing forces; as the West strives for freedom, the East seeks to control it. He cites British attempts to stifle western emigration during the colonial era and as an example of eastern control. Even after independence, the eastern coast of the United States sought to control the West. Religious institutions from the eastern seaboard, in particular, battled for possession of the West. The tensions between small churches as a result of this fight, Turner states, exist today because of the religious attempt to master the West.

American intellect owes its form to the frontier as well. The traits of the frontier are &quot;coarseness and strength combined with acuteness and inquisitiveness; that practical, inventive turn of mind, quick to find expedients; that masterful grasp of material things, lacking in the artistic but powerful to effect great ends; that restless, nervous energy; that dominant individualism, working for good and for evil, and withal that buoyancy and exuberance which comes with freedom.&quot;

Turner concludes the essay by saying that with the end of the frontier, the first period of American history has ended.

==Intellectual context==
===Germanic germ theory===
The Frontier Thesis came about at a time when the Germanic germ theory of history was popular. Proponents of the germ theory believed that political habits are determined by innate racial attributes. Americans inherited such traits as adaptability and self-reliance from the Germanic peoples of Europe. According to the theory, the Germanic race appeared and evolved in the ancient Teutonic forests, endowed with a great capacity for politics and government. Their germs were, directly and by way of England, carried to the New World where they were allowed to germinate in the North American forests. In so doing, the Anglo-Saxons and the Germanic people&#x27;s descendants, being exposed to a forest like their Teutonic ancestors, birthed the free political institutions that formed the foundation of American government.

Historian and ethnologist Hubert Howe Bancroft articulated the latest iteration of the Germanic germ theory just three years before Turner&#x27;s paper in 1893. He argued that the &quot;tide of intelligence&quot; had always moved from east to west. According to Bancroft, the Germanic germs had spread across of all Western Europe by the Middle Ages and had reached their height. This Germanic intelligence was only halted by &quot;civil and ecclesiastical restraints&quot; and a lack of &quot;free land.&quot; This was Bancroft&#x27;s explanation for the Dark Ages.

Turner&#x27;s theory of early American development, which relied on the frontier as a transformative force, opposed Bancroftian racial determinism. Turner referred to the Germanic germ theory by name in his essay, claiming that “too exclusive attention has been paid by institutional students to the Germanic origins.” Turner believed that historians should focus on the settlers’ struggle with the frontier as the catalyst for the creation of American character, not racial or hereditary traits.

Though Turner&#x27;s view would win over the Germanic germ theory&#x27;s version of Western history, the theory persisted for decades after Turner&#x27;s thesis enraptured the American Historical Association. In 1946, medieval historian Carl Stephenson published an extended article refuting the Germanic germ theory. Evidently, the belief that free political institutions of the United States spawned in ancient Germanic forests endured well into the 1940s.

===Racial warfare===
A similarly race-based interpretation of Western history also occupied the intellectual sphere in the United States before Turner. The racial warfare theory was an emerging belief in the late nineteenth century advocated by Theodore Roosevelt in &quot;The Winning of the West&quot;. Though Roosevelt would later accept Turner&#x27;s historiography on the West, calling Turner&#x27;s work a correction or supplementation of his own, the two certainly contradict.

Roosevelt was not entirely unfounded in saying that he and Turner agreed; both Turner and Roosevelt agreed that the frontier had shaped what would become distinctly American institutions and the mysterious entity they each called “national character.” They also agreed that studying the history of the West was necessary to face the challenges to democracy in the late 1890s.

Turner and Roosevelt diverged on the exact aspect of frontier life that shaped the contemporary American. Roosevelt contended that the formation of the American character occurred not with early settlers struggling to survive while learning a foreign land, but “on the cutting edge of expansion” in the early battles with Native Americans in the New World. To Roosevelt, the journey westward was one of nonstop encounters with the “hostile races and cultures” of the New World, forcing the early colonists to defend themselves as they pressed forward. Each side, the Westerners and the native savages, struggled for mastery of the land through violence.

Whereas Turner saw the development of American character occur just behind the frontier line, as the colonists tamed and tilled the land, Roosevelt saw it form in battles just beyond the frontier line. In the end, Turner&#x27;s view would win out among historians, which Roosevelt would accept.

==Evolution==

Turner set up an evolutionary model (he had studied evolution with a leading geologist, Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin), using the time dimension of American history, and the geographical space of the land that became the United States. The first settlers who arrived on the east coast in the 17th century acted and thought like Europeans. They adapted to the new physical, economic and political environment in certain ways—the cumulative effect of these adaptations was Americanization.&lt;ref name=&quot;SM 2023-01/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Successive generations moved further inland, shifting the lines of settlement and wilderness, but preserving the essential tension between the two. European characteristics fell by the wayside and the old country&#x27;s institutions (e.g., established churches, established aristocracies, standing armies, intrusive government, and highly unequal land distribution) were increasingly out of place. Every generation moved further west and became more American, more democratic, and more intolerant of hierarchy. They also became more violent, more individualistic, more distrustful of authority, less artistic, less scientific, and more dependent on ad-hoc organizations they formed themselves. In broad terms, the further west, the more American the community.

==Closed frontier==
Turner saw the land frontier was ending, since the U.S. Census of 1890 had officially stated that the American frontier had broken up.

By 1890, settlement in the American West had reached sufficient population density that the frontier line had disappeared; in 1890 the Census Bureau released a bulletin declaring the closing of the frontier, stating: &quot;Up to and including 1880 the country had a frontier of settlement, but at present the unsettled area has been so broken into by isolated bodies of settlement that there can hardly be said to be a frontier line. In the discussion of its extent, its westward movement, etc., it can not, therefore, any longer have a place in the census reports.&quot;

However, Turner argued that as the North American frontier was ending, a new frontier would have to be pursued, because the country could not maintain its self-concept of being a nation based on ideals without some kind of savage &#x27;other&#x27; to contend with. To this end, he claimed that the rising American influence in the Asia-Pacific constituted a new frontier.

==Comparative frontiers==
Historians, geographers, and social scientists have studied frontier-like conditions in other countries, with an eye on the Turnerian model. South Africa, Canada, Russia, Brazil, Argentina and Australia—and even ancient Rome—had long frontiers that were also settled by pioneers. However these other frontier societies operated in a very difficult political and economic environment that made democracy and individualism much less likely to appear and it was much more difficult to throw off a powerful royalty, standing armies, established churches and an aristocracy that owned most of the land. The question is whether their frontiers were powerful enough to overcome conservative central forces based in the metropolis. Each nation had quite different frontier experiences. For example, the Dutch Boers in South Africa were defeated in war by Britain. In Australia, &quot;mateship&quot; and working together was valued more than individualism. Alexander Petrov noted that Russia had its own frontier and Russians moved over centuries across Siberia all the way from the Urals to the Pacific, struggling with nature in many physical ways similar to the American move across North America—without developing the social and political characteristics noted by Turner. To the contrary, Siberia—the Russian Frontier Land—became emblematic of the oppression of Czarist Absolute Monarchy. This comparison, Petrov suggests, shows that it is far from inevitable that an expanding settlement of wild land would produce the American type of cultural and political institutions. Other factors need to be taken into consideration, such as the great difference between British society from which settlers went across the Atlantic and the Russian society which sent its own pioneers across the Urals. Mexico inherited a vast Northern Frontier from the Spanish Empire, and largely continued existing Spanish institutions in the new world such as the Mission and the Presidio with few exceptions, and lost this new territory to the Americans shortly thereafter before significant development could take place.

==Impact and influence==
Turner&#x27;s thesis quickly became popular among intellectuals. It explained why the American people and American government were so different from their European counterparts. It was popular among New Dealers—Franklin D. Roosevelt and his top aides thought in terms of finding new frontiers. FDR, in celebrating the third anniversary of Social Security in 1938, advised, &quot;There is still today a frontier that remains unconquered—an America unreclaimed. This is the great, the nation-wide frontier of insecurity, of human want and fear. This is the frontier—the America—we have set ourselves to reclaim.&quot; Historians adopted it, especially in studies of the west, but also in other areas, such as the influential work of Alfred D. Chandler Jr. (1918–2007) in business history.

Many believed that the end of the frontier represented the beginning of a new stage in American life and that the United States must expand overseas. However, others viewed this interpretation as the impetus for a new wave in the history of United States imperialism. William Appleman Williams led the &quot;Wisconsin School&quot; of diplomatic historians by arguing that the frontier thesis encouraged American overseas expansion, especially in Asia, during the 20th century. Williams viewed the frontier concept as a tool to promote democracy through both world wars, to endorse spending on foreign aid, and motivate action against totalitarianism. However, Turner&#x27;s work, in contrast to Roosevelt&#x27;s work &quot;The Winning of the West&quot;, places greater emphasis on the development of American republicanism than on territorial conquest. Other historians, who wanted to focus scholarship on minorities, especially Native Americans and Hispanics, started in the 1970s to criticize the frontier thesis because it did not attempt to explain the evolution of those groups. Indeed, their approach was to reject the frontier as an important process and to study the West as a region, ignoring the frontier experience east of the Mississippi River.

Turner never published a major book on the frontier for which he did 40 years of research. However his ideas presented in his graduate seminars at Wisconsin and Harvard influenced many areas of historiography. In the history of religion, for example, Boles (1993) notes that William Warren Sweet at the University of Chicago Divinity School as well as Peter G. Mode (in 1930), argued that churches adapted to the characteristics of the frontier, creating new denominations such as the Mormons, the Church of Christ, the Disciples of Christ, and the Cumberland Presbyterians. The frontier, they argued, shaped uniquely American institutions such as revivals, camp meetings, and itinerant preaching. This view dominated religious historiography for decades. Moos (2002) shows that the 1910s to 1940s black filmmaker and novelist Oscar Micheaux incorporated Turner&#x27;s frontier thesis into his work. Micheaux promoted the West as a place where blacks could experience less institutionalized forms of racism and earn economic success through hard work and perseverance.

Slatta (2001) argues that the widespread popularization of Turner&#x27;s frontier thesis influenced popular histories, motion pictures, and novels, which characterize the West in terms of individualism, frontier violence, and rough justice. Disneyland&#x27;s Frontierland of the mid to late 20th century reflected the myth of rugged individualism that celebrated what was perceived to be the American heritage. The public has ignored academic historians&#x27; anti-Turnerian models, largely because they conflict with and often destroy the icons of Western heritage. However, the work of historians during the 1980s–1990s, some of whom sought to bury Turner&#x27;s conception of the frontier, and others who sought to spare the concept but with nuance, have done much to place Western myths in context.

A modern interpretation describes it as appropriating Indigenous land by means of &quot;American ingenuity&quot;, in the process creating a unique cultural identity different from their European ancestors.

A 2020 study in Econometrica found empirical support for the frontier thesis, showing that frontier experience had a causal impact on individualism.

==Early anti-Turnerian thought==
Though Turner&#x27;s work was massively popular in its time and for decades after, it received significant intellectual pushback in the midst of World War II. This quote from Turner&#x27;s The Frontier in American History is arguably the most famous statement of his work and, to later historians, the most controversial:

This assertion&#x27;s racial overtones concerned historians as Adolf Hitler and the Blood and soil ideology, stoking racial and destructive enthusiasm, rose to power in Germany. An example of this concern is in George Wilson Pierson’s influential essay on the frontier. He asked why the Turnerian American character was limited to the Thirteen Colonies that went on to form the United States, why the frontier did not produce that same character among pre-Columbian Native Americans and Spaniards in the New World.

Despite Pierson and other scholars’ work, Turner&#x27;s influence did not end during World War II or even after the war. Indeed, his influence was felt in American classrooms until the 1970s and 80s.

== Criticisms ==
The Frontier Thesis has met scrutiny in the time since publication. Criticisms of the Thesis include the lack of information regarding how the thesis applies to indigenous Americans, African Americans, and Women. It has been argued that Frontier Thesis is Eurocentric and offers nothing to non-whites. Others postulate that the Thesis simply forgot about them, as in the case of Glenda Riley&#x27;s Article. Indigenous Peoples, Mexican/Hispanic Americans, and African Americans are encouraged by modern scholars to adopt a thesis of their own rather than look towards a Turnerian model. David J Weber&#x27;s article, utilizing the Bolton Thesis, has argued that the Turner Thesis is not applicable to the Mexican Frontier and that cultures have just as much to do with political development than environment, and that isolation from the metropolis can foster despotism as much as foster liberty. Obstacles to Turnerian development in Mexican Frontier history include Geographic isolation promoting caudillismo and disunion, inarable desert and jungle, and rebellious independent indigenous peoples who were at odds with and fought Mexican people. The idea of the frontier thesis has been traded in by certain Historians for a Boltonian outlook that postulates that the culture of the colonizing people shapes the environment rather than the environment shaping the people. Other scholars and contemporary individuals postulate that the equality, unity and liberty promoted by western expansion was illusory and does not account for the Chinese Exclusion Act, or the expansion of poverty and during the Gilded Age, or the spread of slavery westward and disenfranchisement of Mexican-Americans as a result of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. African Slave Marronage in the Southeast and Black Pioneers such as Jim Beckwourth are also ignored despite advancements in the field. Despite criticism, scholars still work to apply the Turnerian Frontier Thesis to Mexico and other Latin American nations.

==New frontiers==
Subsequent critics, historians, and politicians have suggested that other &#x27;frontiers,&#x27; such as scientific innovation, could serve similar functions in American development. Historians have noted that John F. Kennedy in the early 1960s explicitly called upon the ideas of the frontier. At his acceptance speech upon securing the Democratic Party nomination for U.S. president on July 15, 1960, Kennedy called out to the American people, &quot;I am asking each of you to be new pioneers on that New Frontier. My call is to the young in heart, regardless of age—to the stout in spirit, regardless of party.&quot; Mathiopoulos notes that he &quot;cultivated this resurrection of frontier ideology as a motto of progress (&#x27;getting America moving&#x27;) throughout his term of office.&quot; He promoted his political platform as the &quot;New Frontier,&quot; with a particular emphasis on space exploration and technology. Limerick points out that Kennedy assumed that &quot;the campaigns of the Old Frontier had been successful, and morally justified.&quot; The frontier metaphor thus maintained its rhetorical ties to American social progress.

===Fermilab===
Adrienne Kolb and Lillian Hoddeson argue that during the heyday of Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;New Frontier,&quot; the physicists who built Fermilab explicitly sought to recapture the excitement of the old frontier. They argue that, &quot;Frontier imagery motivates Fermilab physicists, and a rhetoric remarkably similar to that of Turner helped them secure support for their research.&quot; Rejecting the East and West coast life styles that most scientists preferred, they selected a Chicago suburb on the prairie as the location of the lab. A small herd of American bison was started at the lab&#x27;s founding to symbolize Fermilab&#x27;s presence on the frontier of physics and its connection to the American prairie. This herd, known as the Fermilab bison herd, still lives on the grounds of Fermilab.
Architecturally, The lab&#x27;s designers rejected the militaristic design of Los Alamos and Brookhaven as well as the academic architecture of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Instead Fermilab&#x27;s planners sought to return to Turnerian themes. They emphasized the values of individualism, empiricism, simplicity, equality, courage, discovery, independence, and naturalism in the service of democratic access, human rights, ecological balance, and the resolution of social, economic, and political issues. Milton Stanley Livingston, the lab&#x27;s associate director, said in 1968, &quot;The frontier of high energy and the infinitesimally small is a challenge to the mind of man. If we can reach and cross this frontier, our generations will have furnished a significant milestone in human history.&quot;

===Electronic frontier===
John Perry Barlow, along with Mitch Kapor, promoted the idea of cyberspace (the realm of telecommunication) as an &quot;electronic frontier&quot; beyond the borders of any physically based government, in which freedom and self-determination could be fully realized. Scholars analyzing the Internet have often cited Frederick Jackson Turner&#x27;s frontier model. Of special concern is the question whether the electronic frontier will broadly replicate the stages of development of the American land frontier.

==Reception==
Alan Escher of allmusic suggested that the album&#x27;s lyrics may be &quot;trying to tap into the incredibly dark overtones&quot; used by Nine Inch Nails&#x27; Trent Reznor, but that the music &quot;is almost always interesting, and [Skold] knows how to rock&quot;. He concluded that the album is good, although not &quot;groundbreaking&quot;.

<text>Lesley Garrett, CBE (born 10 April 1955) is an English soprano singer, musician, broadcaster and media personality. She is noted for being at home in opera and &quot;crossover music&quot;.

==Early life==
Garrett was born in the town of Thorne, near Doncaster (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire), into a musical family. She attended Thorne Fieldside Infant and Junior Schools and Thorne Grammar School. As she grew up she inherited her family&#x27;s love of music. Her grandfather Colin Wall was a classical pianist; her father Derek worked as a railway signalman and then as a schoolteacher at Hatfield Woodhouse Primary School, eventually going on to become a headmaster. They lived nearby just south of the village; her mother Margaret (née Wall) was a talented singing seamstress and became the school secretary at Lesley&#x27;s primary school. She has two sisters, Jill and Kay, one step-sister, Louise, and two step-brothers named Robert and Nicholas. While a student at the Royal Academy of Music she worked as a life model, something of which she is still proud.

==Music==
Garrett has had an extensive music career. A graduate of the Royal Academy of Music and an alumna of the prestigious National Opera Studio, she won the Decca Prize of the Kathleen Ferrier Award in 1979, thereby launching her career. Her professional debut, in 1979, was as Amor in &quot;Orontea&quot; at the music festival in Batignano. She subsequently sang, in 1980, Alice in &quot;Le comte Ory&quot; at the London Coliseum and Dorinda in &quot;Orlando&quot; at the Wexford Festival, in 1981, also at Wexford, the title role in &quot;Zaide&quot;, in 1982 Sophie in &quot;Werther&quot; with Opera North and in 1984 Damigella in &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; at Glyndebourne. From 1984, as principal soprano at English National Opera, she became well known for her performances in productions of the operas &quot;Serse&quot;, &quot;Le Nozze di Figaro&quot;, &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot;.

Garrett has performed across the world, in countries throughout Europe, and also the United States, Australia, Russia, Brazil, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea. She has also sung opera and pop classics with Bryan Ferry, Eurythmics and Mick Hucknall to celebrate the arrival of the new century on Millennium Eve in the grounds at the Royal Observatory and National Maritime Museum.

She played the lead role of Hanna Glawari in the Welsh National Opera&#x27;s production of &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, which toured the United Kingdom in 2005. In 2006 she sang the role of Mother Abbess in Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s revival of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. In 2008, she joined the cast of &quot;Carousel&quot; as Nettie Fowler. The production toured the UK and then transferred to the West End&#x27;s Savoy Theatre. In 2013 she returned to opera with the monodrama &quot;La Voix humaine&quot; for Opera North.

She created the role of Val in &quot;Pleasure&quot;, the first opera by Mark Simpson, directed by Tim Albery and premiered at the Howard Assembly Room by Opera North, in April 2016.

Garrett is a member of the board of the English National Opera and a vice president of Harrogate International Festivals.

In 2002 Garrett was appointed a CBE for her services to music. She was also awarded with a BASCA Gold Badge Award in October 2010, in recognition of her contribution to music.

===Performances at sporting events===
Garrett has performed at several FA Cup Finals, including the 2000 Final, the last to be held at the old Wembley Stadium, the 2007 final held at the new Wembley Stadium (alongside Sarah Brightman), and the 2008 Final (alongside Katherine Jenkins).

She also sang the British national anthem on the Champs-Élysées in Paris in 2012 after Bradley Wiggins became the first Briton to win the Tour de France, though her performance was not universally appreciated.

==Television and radio==
In 2004, Garrett was one of the participants in the first series of the celebrity talent contest &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;; she and her dance partner Anton du Beke finished third. In the same year she took part in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, a genealogy documentary series, in which she journeyed through her home town of Thorne in search of her family history. She was delighted to discover that the musical gene stretched far back and had run in her family for several generations: her maternal grandfather made a living playing the piano with a small orchestra that accompanied silent films at cinemas in and around Sheffield. A great-grandfather was a travelling musician, working across northern England in the 19th century, playing to workers in pubs and clubs. During the First World War he entertained troops on the piano. Garrett is a veteran of Dictionary Corner on the Channel 4 game show &quot;Countdown&quot;, and in June 2005 it was thought that she was to become one of the show&#x27;s rotating guest hosts while Richard Whiteley was recovering from illness. After Whiteley&#x27;s death, however, the plan for rotating guest hosts was abandoned and Des Lynam took the role for the next fifteen months. Garrett did not appear on &quot;Countdown&quot; again until October 2009.

On Christmas Day 2004, BBC Two broadcast &quot;Lesley Garrett – Music from the Movies&quot;, co-starring her with Ruthie Henshall, Michael McCarthy with the backing of the Opera North orchestra. The programme was recorded at the &quot;Opera In The Park&quot; concert which had taken place in the grounds of Temple Newsam, West Yorkshire on 19 July 2003.

In February 2005, Garrett was selected to be one of the judges for BBC&#x27;s &quot;Comic Relief does Fame Academy&quot;, and in May she hosted and sang at the 2005 Classical BRIT Awards at the Royal Albert Hall on ITV. She was a regular panellist on the ITV daytime show &quot;Loose Women&quot; during 2006; she featured there again in 2009 and 2010, before returning in May 2014. Garrett also appeared on &quot;This Morning&quot; and &quot;Loose Women&quot; in 2007, to perform a song from her latest album &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;. She also continued the post as a judge on &quot;Comic Relief Does Fame Academy&quot; in 2007. She currently presents a show on the British classical radio station Classic FM.

From February 2008 Garrett presented the show &quot;Lesley Garrett&#x27;s 20 Operas to See Before You Die&quot; on &quot;Sky Arts&quot;.

Over four weeks, beginning on 30 November 2008, she presented the Sunday morning BBC1 programme &quot;Christmas Voices&quot;.

In November 2010 she joined a long line of panellists on Five&#x27;s &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot;.

Along with Larry Lamb, Garrett presented a short BBC series entitled &quot;When Royals Wed&quot; to celebrate the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in April 2011.

On 30 May 2014 she made her return to the ITV daytime show &quot;Loose Women&quot;. It was announced on the programme that she would become a regular panellist again.

She featured on the TV show &quot;My Life on a Plate&quot; on 10 September 2017; chef Brian Turner accompanied her on a trip to key locations from her childhood in Yorkshire, where she was taught by her parents to make the most out of what was available. The chef then created two dishes that wove nostalgia and the taste of home together.

==Personal life==
Garrett married in May 1991: her husband, Dr. Peter Christian, is a retired G.P. in Muswell Hill. They have a son, Jeremy, and a daughter, Chloe. The family home is in north London.

==Discography==
As a recording artist, Garrett has released eleven solo albums. Many of them have been successful, receiving gold and silver status. &quot;Soprano in Red&quot; received the Gramophone Award for &quot;Best-selling Classical Artist of the Year&quot;. Garrett was also a featured artist on the platinum selling &quot;Perfect Day&quot; single released by the BBC in aid of Children in Need.

Garrett created the role of Cathy in the London studio recording of Bernard J. Taylor&#x27;s operatic version of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, which also featured Dave Willetts, Bonnie Langford and other leading British musical theatre performers. Her rendition of &quot;I Belong to the Earth&quot; was included on two of her solo albums.

Other recordings include complete audio operas: Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (Papagena) conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras, Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (Despina), also conducted by Mackerras and Yum-Yum in the audio and video recordings of the Jonathan Miller production of &quot;The Mikado&quot; from ENO, in which she played the leading soprano role, Yum-Yum. She appears on two other DVDs of complete works from English National Opera, Handel&#x27;s &quot;Ariodante&quot; (Dalinda) and &quot;Xerxes&quot; (Atalanta). In the video of the 1984 Glyndebourne &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; under Raymond Leppard, she sings Nutrice and Valletto.

Garrett&#x27;s only credit on a hit single was on a version of &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, which she performed with leukaemia sufferer Amanda Thompson for the television programme Hearts of Gold, which reached no. 16 in the UK singles charts at the end of the November 1993.

The destroyer was laid down by the Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas on 20 December 1944, launched on 26 May 1945 by Mrs. Percy Bass, mother of Lt. Cmdr. Bass and commissioned on 1 October 1945.

==History==

===United States Navy service===
USS &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; (DD-887) was laid down on 20 December 1944 at Orange, Texas, by the Consolidated Steel Corporation and launched on 26 May 1945 sponsored by Mrs. Verna Maulding Bass. The destroyer was commissioned on 1 October 1945.

The destroyer spent the remainder of 1945 outfitting and conducting shakedown training in the Gulf of Mexico. She then put into Charleston, South Carolina, for post-shakedown availability. On 2 February 1946, the warship stood out of Charleston on her way to the U.S. West Coast. After transiting the Panama Canal, &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; arrived in San Diego on 20 February. She remained at San Diego less than a week. On the 26th, the destroyer was underway bound for the western Pacific Ocean. Early that spring the destroyer arrived in Shanghai, China, and began duty transporting mail between the various naval commands in China. She made the rounds between Shanghai, Tsingtao, and Hong Kong, and conducted maneuvers with Task Forces (TF) 58 and 77. In December, the destroyer began the voyage home, stopping at Guam and at Pearl Harbor before arriving back in San Diego in February 1947.

For the next year, &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; participated in type training and independent ship&#x27;s exercises along the coast of southern California. During the summer of 1947, she entered Hunters Point Naval Shipyard for regular overhaul. The repair period lasted until November, at which time the destroyer resumed local operations. In February 1948, she headed back to the Far East for a deployment of about eight months. During that cruise, she visited Tsingtao, China; as well as the Japanese port cities of Fukuoka, Osaka, Sasebo, Yokohama, and Yokosuka. The warship returned to San Diego in October and resumed local operations out of her home port. In February 1949, she departed the waters of southern California to participate in Operation &quot;Micowex&quot; conducted in Alaskan waters. &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; reentered San Diego in March, and April saw her begin another regular overhaul, that time at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard.

In July, the warship resumed operations along the coast of southern California. In October, &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; embarked upon her third tour of duty in the Orient. During that deployment, she alternated port visits in Japan, China, Okinawa, and the Philippines with training evolutions and patrols in Tsushima Strait. Returning via Guam and Pearl Harbor, the destroyer arrived back home in June 1950.

====Korean War====
On 25 June 1950, the Korean War broke out. &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot;, however, did not get into the conflict immediately. Scheduled for regular overhaul, she entered the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard on 16 August and remained there until 8 October. After about a month of normal operations, the destroyer departed San Diego on 6 November, bound for her first tour of duty in the Korean combat zone. She made the normal stops, Pearl Harbor, Midway Island, and Sasebo, Japan before joining Task Force 77 off the Korean coast on 25 November. &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; served the carriers of TF 77 as plane guard and anti-submarine escort.

Such remained her mission until late in April 1951 when she and her division mates were detached to escort a convoy of transports to Japanese ports. On 16 May, she reported for duty with TF 95, the &quot;Blockading and Escort Force&quot;, for duty off Wonsan harbour. For the next 30 days, the warship shelled enemy installations continually and vectored in air strikes on other targets. On 20 May, a North Korean shore battery succeeded in wounding 10 &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; crewmembers, one of them fatally, with shell fragments from a near-miss to starboard. On 27 June, she resumed duty as plane guard and escort to the carriers of TF 77. She and her division were relieved by Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 91 on 18 July, and they headed home via Yokosuka and Pearl Harbor. &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; reentered San Diego on 6 August. After a post-deployment leave and upkeep period, the destroyer resumed normal operations out of San Diego.

That employment lasted until the first month of 1952. On 26 January 1952, she stood out of San Diego in company with and bound for the Korean War once more. After stops at Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Yokosuka, she reported for duty in the screen of TF 77 on 25 February 1952. That assignment lasted until 19 March when she rejoined TF 95 at Wonsan harbour. Over the next two weeks, the destroyer delivered gunfire on enemy installations. She also received return fire from shore batteries; and, on 25 March, she took a hit on the centerline amidships that injured three crewmen. Relieved of duty at Wonsan on 1 April, &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; headed for Yokosuka and repairs.

Back on station with TF 77 by mid-April, the warship screened the carriers and participated in shore bombardments for the next six weeks. The last week of that tour saw her assisting the Republic of Korea frigate ROKS &quot;Apnok&quot; 62 which had nearly been severed in half in a collision. On 27 May, she was detached from TF 77 for an eight-day respite at Sasebo. The warship was back off Wonsan on 6 June and spent two weeks bombarding the North Koreans. On 22 June, her division, DesDiv 52, was relieved at Wonsan and shaped a course for Okinawa whence she conducted two weeks of antisubmarine warfare training. Following that, &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; served a two-week tour with the Taiwan Strait patrol. On 28 July, the destroyer rejoined the screen of TF 77. On 31 July, she performed her last mission of the deployment—a gunfire mission on the eastern coast of Korea.

&quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; returned to San Diego on 26 August 1952 and began post-deployment leave and upkeep. On 15 September, the warship departed San Diego on her way to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. The overhaul lasted until late January 1953. On the 26th, she got underway to return to San Diego whence she operated through the second week in April. On 18 April, the destroyer stood out of San Diego on her way back to the Far East. Once again, she alternated between assignments with TF 77, TF 95, and the Taiwan Strait patrol. The mission lasted until 2 November 1953 at which time she departed Yokosuka to return to San Diego. Following a December of leave and upkeep, &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; entered the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard for another overhaul. After those repairs, the warship resumed training operations out of San Diego in preparation for another deployment to the Far East.

The armistice ending hostilities in Korea had taken effect on 27 July 1953 during the warship&#x27;s most recent deployment to the western Pacific. Consequently, her tours of duty in the Far East over the ensuing decade assumed a more peaceful and routine character. Between July 1953 and June 1963, &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; deployed to the Orient seven times. In each instance, she coupled visits to various Asiatic ports with exercises with units of the United States Seventh Fleet and intermittent duty on the Taiwan Strait patrol. Only during 1961 did she see no time overseas because of an extensive Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul.

The last of those peacetime cruises ended at Long Beach in June 1963. That was followed by 27 months of duty along the California coast that also included a four-month regular overhaul at the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard between April and August 1964. Just as she was preparing to leave the yard, an event, the Tonkin Gulf incident, occurred off the coast of Vietnam. It helped to bring the United States into the Vietnamese civil war as a full belligerent. Though &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; spent another year in peaceful operations along the west coast, that incident meant that her remaining Far East deployments would be of a combat nature.

====Vietnam War====
On 28 September 1965, the destroyer departed Long Beach in a task group built around the aircraft carrier . The task group spent about two weeks engaged in exercises in the Hawaii operating area before continuing its voyage west. The warships arrived in Subic Bay in the Philippines on 30 October. Three days later, she was on her way to Vietnamese waters where she screened and served as her plane guard during air strikes on North Vietnam. That brief line tour ended 10 days later back at Naval Station Subic Bay. On 21 November, the destroyer put to sea once again. After type training at the Tabones shore bombardment range, she headed for Da Nang, South Vietnam, where she trained for duty as a search and rescue (SAR) ship in the Gulf of Tonkin. She then began a 30-day tour of duty on her SAR station.

Still engaged in SAR duties at the beginning of 1966, &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; was not relieved of that mission until 5 February 1966. That relief occurred as a result of damage to her bow which she suffered in a collision with on the night of 4 and 5 February. After a stop at Da Nang where the damage was inspected, the destroyer moved on to Subic Bay where she received a false bow. On 7 March, the warship departed Subic Bay on her way to the United States and permanent repairs. Following stops at Guam, Midway, and Pearl Harbor, she arrived in Long Beach on 8 April. About a month later, the destroyer began repairs at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. She left the drydock on 21 June and, soon thereafter, began normal west coast operations. That employment carried her through most of the remainder of 1966.

On 27 December 1966, &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; stood out of Long Beach to return to the Far East. She made the usual stopover at Pearl Harbor and arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 15 January 1967. Four days later, the destroyer began the transit to Subic Bay where she arrived on the 24th. Following gunfire support training at the Tabones range early in February, she shaped a course for the south SAR station in company with . The two warships arrived on station on 6 February. Over the next month, Brinkley Bass participated in one gunfire support mission and four SAR incidents. Relieved by on 5 March, the destroyer headed for the northern fire support area of I Corps zone where she conducted one fire support mission on 8 March. She then steamed in company with on Yankee Station before putting into Kaohsiung, Taiwan, on 19 March.

The warship remained at Kaohsiung until 27 March at which time she headed back to Vietnam. On the 29th, she relieved Waddell as gunfire support ship in the I Corps zone. She joined in supporting the closing phase of Operation &quot;Beacon Hill,&quot; a combination vertical and horizontal amphibious assault on Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces threatening the United States Marine Corps Firebase Gio Linh. That operation ended on 1 April; and, the next day, &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; relieved along the shores of the II Corps zone. She spent the next six days supporting the 9th Republic of Korea (ROK) Regiment&#x27;s Operation &quot;Pang Ma Tao.&quot; On 7 April, the destroyer joined the screen of on Yankee Station. That assignment lasted until 13 April when she transferred to a task group built around USS &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;. Ten days later, the warship returned to gunfire support missions in the northern portion of the II Corps zone.

Relieved of that duty on 27 April, she joined &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and &quot;Waddell&quot; on the 25th for the passage to Subic Bay. Stops at Subic Bay, Hong Kong, and Yokosuka occupied her during the first half of May. On 19 May, &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; departed Yokosuka on her way back to the United States. The warship arrived back in Long Beach on the 29th. After the usual post-deployment standdown period, she began normal operations out of Long Beach. That employment lasted until 1 September when the destroyer began preparations for her overhaul. She entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 17 October and remained there through the end of the year.

&quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; completed her overhaul on 13 January 1968 and resumed local operations out of Long Beach. Those operations continued until 18 July when she departed Long Beach for the Far East in company with , , and . The warships arrived in Pearl Harbor on 24 July and then put to sea again on the 25th to escort during the carrier&#x27;s operational readiness inspection. Upon completion of that mission, the destroyer continued her voyage to the Orient in company with &quot;Hancock&quot; and arrived in Yokosuka on 8 August. The task group remained in Yokosuka until 11 August and then got underway for Subic Bay where it arrived on 15 August. Three days later, she was on her way to the Gulf of Tonkin. For almost five months, the destroyer divided her time between carrier escort duties and gunfire support missions. She completed her last line period on 8 January 1969 and headed for the Philippines. &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; visited Subic Bay from 9 to 13 January and Yokosuka from 17 to 20 January. On the latter day, she got underway for home.

The warship arrived in Long Beach on 31 January 1969. There she began a leave and upkeep period that lasted until mid-April. On 14 April, she returned to sea to begin normal operations along the California coast. Training operations—including a midshipman training cruise to Pearl Harbor in July—occupied her time through the summer and fall of 1969. At the end of the year, Brinkley Bass began preparations for another tour of duty in the Far East. The destroyer departed Long Beach on 12 January 1970. After stops at Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Guam, she arrived in Subic Bay on 2 February. Once again, the warship spent five months alternating between Vietnamese waters and various ports in the Far East. When off Vietnam, she screened aircraft carriers and provided gunfire support for the troops ashore. In addition, she served one tour of duty on the Taiwan Strait patrol and conducted surveillance on Soviet trawlers snooping the American warships. &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; departed Subic Bay and shaped a course via Guam, Midway, and Pearl Harbor for California. She arrived in Long Beach on 2 July.

After post-deployment leave and upkeep, the destroyer resumed training missions out of Long Beach. On 10 September, she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for a three-month overhaul. The warship left the shipyard on 10 December and resumed normal operations along the California coast. That employment continued through the end of the year and well into 1971. On 14 May 1971, Brinkley Bass embarked upon her last deployment to the Orient. Steaming in company with , she made a stop at Pearl Harbor before arriving in Subic Bay on 29 May. For almost four months, the warship served the familiar line periods off the coast of Vietnam screening carriers and providing gunfire support for the ground troops. She completed her last mission on 5 September and headed for Subic Bay. From there on 19 September, the warship embarked upon a circuitous voyage home. She made stops at the Australian ports of Darwin, Townsville, Sydney, and Napier before shaping a course for Long Beach on 11 October. She stopped at Pago Pago, Samoa, for fuel and at Pearl Harbor before returning to her home port on 24 October.

&quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; spent the rest of her active career in operations conducted between the west coast and Hawaii. For the most part, her duties consisted of training; and, after 1 July 1972, she became a Naval Reserve training ship. Thus, she trained reservists during their annual two weeks of active duty. At that same time, her home port was changed to Tacoma, Washington. She conducted her training missions from that port until decommissioned at San Diego on 3 December 1973. Her name was struck from the Navy list that same day and, she was simultaneously transferred to Brazil.

&quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; earned seven battle stars during the Korean conflict and nine battle stars for service in Vietnamese waters.

===Brazilian Navy service===

&quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; was transferred to Brazil and renamed &quot;Mariz e Barros&quot; (D-26). The Brazilian Navy decommissioned &quot;Mariz e Barros&quot; on 1 September 1997. She then served as a pierside training ship until expended as a target in December 2000.
