== Romances sans paroles ==

So many composers in the French tradition wrote &quot;Romances sans paroles&quot;, &quot;Romances without words&quot;, from the 1840s onwards that the radical poet Paul Verlaine in turn published a collection of his impressionistic poems as &quot;Romances sans paroles&quot; (1874).

== Russian romance ==
During the 19th century Alexander Alyabyev (1787–1851), Alexander Varlamov (1801–48) and Alexander Gurilyov (1803–58) developed the French variety of the romance as a sentimental category of Russian art song. &quot;Black Eyes&quot; is perhaps the best known example. Among other notable examples of the Russian Romance are &quot;Shine, Shine, My Star&quot; and &quot;Along the Long Road&quot;.

British singer Marc Almond is the only Western artist to receive acclaim in Western Europe as well as in Russia for singing English versions of Russian romances and Russian chanson on his albums &quot;Heart on Snow&quot; and &quot;Orpheus in Exile&quot;.

<text>Pierre-Henri Clostermann (28 February 1921 – 22 March 2006) was a World War II French ace fighter pilot.

During the conflict he has been claimed to have achieved 33 air-to-air combat victories, earning the accolade &quot;France&#x27;s First Fighter&quot; from General Charles de Gaulle. His wartime memoir, &quot;The Big Show (Le Grand Cirque)&quot; became a notable bestseller. After the war, he worked as an engineer and was the youngest Member of France&#x27;s Parliament.

==Early life between Brazil, France and the USA==
Clostermann was born and raised in Curitiba, Brazil, into a French diplomatic family. He was the only son of Madeleine Carlier from Lorraine and Jacques Clostermann from Alsace. He was perfectly fluent in Portuguese. There, he met French superstars of the time Jean Mermoz and Henri Guillaumet, then Aéropostale pilots. In 1935, he received his first flight on the seaplane Latécoère 521 &quot;Lieutenant de Vaisseau Paris&quot; on the Lac de Biscarrosse in South West France. In 1937, at the age of sixteen, he learned to fly at the Brazilian flying club in Manguinhos on Bücker Bü 131 Jungmann and Bü 133 Jungmeister with German pilot Karl Benitz (died in 1943, Russia). After receiving flying tuition , he completed his secondary education in France and gained his private pilot&#x27;s licence in 1937.
In 1937, he studied at the Franco-Brazilian high school Molière, in Rio de Janeiro. At the same time, he began writing columns for the newspaper &quot;Correio da Manhã&quot;.
From 1938 to 1940, he took aeronautical engineering courses at the Ryan School of Aeronautics in San Diego, in the United States of America. In 1940, he obtained his aeronautical engineering diploma and his professional pilot&#x27;s license. He then joined England, via Brazil, Uruguay and South Africa, to join the Free French Air Force. He already had 315 flight hours under his belt.

==World War II==
On the outbreak of war in 1939 the French authorities refused his application for service, so he travelled to Los Angeles to become a commercial pilot, studying at the California Institute of Technology. Clostermann joined the Free French Air Force in the United Kingdom in March 1942. After training at RAF Cranwell and 61 OTU, Clostermann, a sergeant pilot, was posted in January 1943 to No. 341 Squadron RAF (known to the Free French as &quot;Groupe de Chasse n° 3/2 &quot;Alsace&quot;&quot;), flying the Supermarine Spitfire.

On 15 July 1943 he crash-landed after combat when unable to lower his undercarriage (Cat.B). He scored his first two victories on 27 July 1943, also as Yellow 2, claiming destruction of two Focke-Wulf Fw 190s over France.
In October 1943, Clostermann received a commission as an officer, and was assigned to the British No. 602 Squadron RAF, remaining with the unit for the next ten months. He flew a variety of operations including fighter sweeps, bomber escorts, high-altitude interdiction over the Royal Navy&#x27;s Scapa Flow base, and strafing or dive-bombing attacks on V-1 launch sites on the French coast. He flew air-cover for the Normandy Landings, and, on 11 June, was one of the first Free French pilots to land on French soil, at temporary airstrip B-2 near Bazenville, before moving to B-11, near Longues-sur-Mer, Normandy on 18 June 1944. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross shortly afterwards, after which he was reassigned to French Air Force Headquarters.
In December 1944 he returned to the front line on re-secondment to the Royal Air Force as a supernumerary flight lieutenant. He joined No. 274 Squadron RAF flying the new Hawker Tempest Mk V. In an aircraft which he named &quot;Le Grand Charles&quot; (named after both the &quot;Vieux Charles&quot;, the aircraft of 53-kill French WWI ace Georges Guynemer, and the Free French leader Charles de Gaulle, who was known for his height) , Clostermann flew an intensive and highly successful round of fighter sweeps, airfield attacks, &quot;rat scramble&quot; interceptions of Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters, and rail interdiction missions over northern Germany over the next two months.

In March 1945 he briefly served with No. 56 Squadron, before transfer to No. 3 Squadron. On 24 March 1945 he was wounded in the leg by German flak, and after belly-landing his badly damaged aircraft was hospitalised for a week. From 8 April 1945 he was commander of &quot;A&quot; Flight, No. 3 Squadron RAF. He was awarded a bar to his DFC. He was later promoted to Wing Commander (flying) of 122 Wing, the most prestigious wing in the R.A.F., at the age of 24.

On 12 May 1945 during a victory fly-past to mark the war&#x27;s conclusion, another Tempest collided with his, and as a result an air pile-up occurred with four close formation low-flying aeroplanes of his flight involved, with three pilots being killed. Clostermann bailed out, his parachute opening just a few metres above the ground. He continued operations with No. 122 Wing RAF until he left the military altogether on 27 July 1945 with the RAF rank of wing commander and the French rank of &quot;lieutenant&quot;.

In his 432 sorties, Clostermann has been credited with 33 victories (19 solo, 14 shared, most of them against fighters), a predominant source being his own book “The big show”, and five &quot;probables&quot;, with eight more &quot;damaged&quot;. He also claimed 225 motor vehicles destroyed, 72 locomotives, five tanks, and two E-boats (fast torpedo boats). Many references credit him with 29 to 33 victories, although these probably include his &quot;ground&quot; kills of enemy aircraft. Recent, more detailed analysis of his combat reports and squadron accounts indicate that his actual score was 11 destroyed, with possibly another seven, for a total of 15–18 victories.

==Later life==
In 1951, Clostermann authored an account of his wartime experiences entitled &quot;Le Grand Cirque&quot; (published in English as &quot;The Big Show&quot;). One of the first post-war fighter pilot memoirs, its various editions have sold over two and a half million copies. William Faulkner commented that this is the finest aviation book to come out of World War II. The book was reprinted, in expanded form, in both paperback and hardcover editions in 2004. It was also adapted in comic book form by Manuel Perales, in close collaboration with Clostermann. Clostermann also wrote &quot;Feux du Ciel&quot; (&quot;Flames in the Sky&quot;) published in 1957, a collection of heroic air combat exploits from both Allied and Axis sides.

After the war, Clostermann continued his career as an engineer, participating in the creation of Reims Aviation, supporting the Max Holste Broussard prototype, acting as a representative for Cessna, and working for Renault.

He served eight terms as a (member of parliament) in the French National Assembly between 1946 and 1969. As a deputy for Marne he resigned from the Gaullist group in 1955 over their treatment of the Resident-General in French Morocco during the negotiations with nationalist movement.

He also briefly re-enlisted in the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; in 1956–57 to fly ground-attack missions during the Algerian War. He subsequently published a novel based on his experiences there, entitled &quot;Leo 25 Airborne&quot;.

During the Falklands War in early 1982 comments publicly emerged from Clostermann expressing praise for the courage displayed by Argentine Air Force and Argentine Navy pilots during their air-to-sea attacks on the Royal Navy. Clostermann had written the comments, which were partly motivated by ethnic insults towards Argentinians that he had become aware of in the British press during the conflict, in a letter to a class of Argentine fighter-pilots who were being trained at that time in France at an &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; establishment, at which his son was an instructor. The private letter&#x27;s comments, from a renowned World War II military hero, swiftly found their way across the Atlantic Ocean to Buenos Aires, where they were published in newspapers as war propaganda. As a result of this perceived &quot;betrayal&quot; of his links with the United Kingdom via his war service in the Royal Air Force, Clostermann attracted hostility from parts of the British press.

He also attracted controversy in France for his vehement anti-war stance in the run-up to the 1991 Gulf War.

==Death==
Clostermann died on 22 March 2006 at his home at Montesquieu-des-Albères, in the French Pyrenees.

==Private life==
While serving in Lincolnshire, Pierre met and married Lydia Jeanne Starbuck at St Denys Church in Sleaford on the 28th of April 1943. They had three sons.

==Honours==

On 6 June 2004, a road in Longues-sur-Mer, near temporary airstrip B-11, was named after Clostermann.

<text>Abiezer Coppe (1619 – 1672) was one of the English Ranters and a writer of prophetic religious pamphlets.

==Biography==

He was born in Warwick on 20 May 1619 and was a pupil of Thomas Dugard at The King&#x27;s School, Warwick. From there he went to All Souls College, Oxford and also Merton College, Oxford. One of Coppe&#x27;s major works is the &quot;Fiery Flying Roll&quot; of 1649, a (highly heretical) tirade against inequality and hypocrisy which vividly evokes the charged and visionary atmosphere that swept over England during the civil war and interregnum.

While Coppe&#x27;s views were unpopular with Royalists, they were equally disliked by Parliamentarians, and shortly after the &quot;Fiery Flying Roll&quot; was published he was imprisoned at Newgate Prison and the book burned.

Coppe was later released and celebrated by publishing &quot;Coppe&#x27;s return to the ways of righteousness&quot;, in which he retracted his previous heresies, while adding a few more. Like Lodowick Muggleton and the Diggers&#x27; leader Gerrard Winstanley, Coppe combined an egalitarian social vision with an apocalyptic religious one.

In 1657 he apparently changed his name to Dr Higham, and was buried under that name at Barnes church on 23 August 1672.

==Reception==

Coppe has been written about by Norman Cohn, &quot;M.A. Poultney&quot; and the Marxist historians A. L. Morton and Christopher Hill.

He has also been celebrated in modern folk music; there is a folk song about him with the eponymous title &quot;Abiezer Coppe&quot; on the Leon Rosselson album &quot;Love, Loneliness, Laundry&quot;, which has since been released on CD on Rosselson&#x27;s compilation &quot;Guess What They&#x27;re Selling At The Happiness Counter&quot;.

In 2018 the band Barnstormer 1649, led by poet Attila the Stockbroker, included a different song about Coppe with the same title on their album Restoration Tragedy.

Coppe appears as a character in Caryl Churchill&#x27;s 1976 play Light Shining in Buckinghamshire.

<doc id="521452" wikidata="Q2379871" url="?curid=521452" title="Stalin's speech of 19 August 1939">
<text>A secret speech was allegedly given by Joseph Stalin, on 19 August 1939, to members of the Politburo, wherein he justified the Soviet strategy to promote military conflict in Europe, which would be beneficial for the future territorial expansion of the Communist system. The strategy included Soviet-Nazi collaboration and the suggestion of what has become the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.

The historicity of the speech is still the subject of academic debate. Plausible textual evidence of this speech found in various reputable archives has been academically studied and published, however no formal first-hand evidence of a Politburo &quot;meeting&quot; held on 19 August 1939 or the delivery of the quoted speech has yet been proven.

== Source material and timeline ==
The first version of this speech was published partially on 28 November 1939, in the Paris newspaper &quot;Le Temps&quot; by the news agency &quot;Havas&quot; despatch from Geneva. Since then several versions, varying in content, have been in circulation.

In 1994, the Russian publicist Tatiana Bushuyeva () published the text of the speech in an article printed in the &quot;Novy Mir&quot; magazine based on what she claimed was recent findings in the Special Archive of the USSR of a text, which according to her was supposedly recorded by a Comintern member present at the meeting (and she published the Russian translation thereof). Sergey Sluch questions its authenticity remarking that the document was in French and stored in the &quot;Trophies Funds&quot; of the Archive, and that the text mostly matches the one from Havas, but Bushueva skipped some dubious passages.

== Historicity and debate ==
Whether this speech was ever given by Stalin is still the subject of dispute by historians. According to Viktor Suvorov&#x27;s book &quot;Icebreaker&quot;, Soviet historians laid special emphasis on claiming that no Politburo meeting took place on 19 August 1939, but the Russian military historian Dmitri Volkogonov has found the evidence that a meeting really took place on that day. However the only military issue in the agenda of the meeting, according to Volkogonov, was the deferment from conscription of the construction workers of the Akmolinsk–Kartaly railway.

The speech took place according to research book &quot;Stalin&#x27;s Missed Chance&quot; by the military historian Mikhail Meltyukhov, which covers the alleged offensive plans by Stalin. However, the third edition of the book, in 2008, omits any mention of 1939 speech.

Historian of the Russian Academy of Sciences also reviewed the history of the subject.

She attended Washington Junior High School in Naperville and later graduated from Naperville Central High School in 1974. Zahn also competed in several beauty pageants, making the semi-finals of the 1973 Miss Teenage America Pageant. She continued her education at Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, on a cello scholarship, and received firsthand knowledge of the news business by working as an intern at WBBM-TV in Chicago. She graduated in 1978 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism. Zahn then spent the next 10 years working at local stations around the country, including WFAA-TV in Dallas, KFMB-TV in San Diego, KPRC-TV in Houston, WHDH-TV (then WNEV) in Boston, and KCBS-TV in Los Angeles.

In 1987, Zahn accepted an offer to work at ABC News, initially anchoring &quot;The Health Show&quot;, a weekend program on health and medical issues. Within a few months she was co-anchoring &quot;World News This Morning&quot;, the network&#x27;s early morning newscast, and anchoring news segments on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; as well as substituting for co-host Joan Lunden.

===CBS===
In 1990, Zahn was offered a job at CBS News, which she took beginning on February 26, 1990, co-anchoring &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; with Harry Smith. During this time, she helped cover the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France with Tim McCarver and the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, as well as covering the Waco siege. Both she and Smith left after changes were made at the morning show in 1996 with their last day being on June 14, 1996. Zahn then went on to work as anchor of the Saturday edition of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, as well as substituting for Dan Rather during the week, and contributing reports to &quot;48 Hours&quot;, &quot;Public Eye with Bryant Gumbel&quot;, and &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;.

===Fox News Channel===
In 1999, after nine years at CBS News, Zahn moved to the world of cable news, joining Fox News Channel (FNC), where she anchored &quot;Fox Report&quot;, the network&#x27;s nightly newscast. Months later, she helped launch her own prime time news program, &quot;The Edge with Paula Zahn&quot;.

===CNN===
Zahn began her work at CNN on September 11, 2001, joining anchor Aaron Brown in the coverage of that day&#x27;s terrorist attacks as her reaction to the events she witnessed. Although not scheduled to appear on a CNN program, which was still in development, she began a regular morning news shift the next day. By January, she launched her CNN morning news program, &quot;American Morning with Paula Zahn&quot;.
In 2003, during the Iraq War, Zahn moved back to prime time, hosting a two-hour program labeled &quot;Live from the Headlines&quot; which offered continuing coverage of the war and other events. Anderson Cooper took over the first of the two hours by early summer, and by September, her show, &quot;Paula Zahn Now&quot;, premiered.

On July 24, 2007, she announced her resignation from CNN. The final broadcast of &quot;Paula Zahn Now&quot; aired August 2, 2007. The announcement came less than a day after CNN hired Campbell Brown, the former co-host of &quot;Weekend Today&quot;. Initially, guest hosts essentially continued Zahn&#x27;s program under the title &quot;Out in the Open&quot;. This was later replaced by election campaign coverage and ultimately Brown&#x27;s program, &quot;Campbell Brown: No Bias, No Bull&quot;.

According to Zahn&#x27;s goodbye letter penned to CNN staff, she stated &quot;I plan to take a break between jobs and catch my breath before I take on my next role.&quot; In a &quot;New York Times&quot; interview, which was conducted right after the announcement of her resignation broke, Zahn told Jacques Steinberg that &quot;she had no idea what she would be doing next&quot;.

===WNET===
On November 9, 2008, Zahn became the new co-host of &quot;SundayArts&quot; on New York City PBS stations WNET and WLIW. The program, which covers the fine arts scene in New York City, is now called &quot;NYC-ARTS&quot; and airs Thursday evenings.

===Investigation Discovery===
On January 9, 2009, Discovery Communications announced that Zahn, along with producing partners Scott Weinberger and Scott Sternberg, had entered into a development deal for a true crime documentary series. &quot;On the Case with Paula Zahn&quot; premiered October 18, 2009 on the Investigation Discovery cable channel.

===PBS===
On New Year&#x27;s Day 2011, Zahn hosted the annual &quot;From Vienna: The New Year&#x27;s Celebration&quot; episode of the anthology series &quot;Great Performances&quot; on PBS.

==Personal life==
Zahn has three children, Austin, Jared, and Haley, with Richard Cohen, a New York City real estate developer. Cohen is Jewish and they raised the children in his faith.

The couple was in the news in 2004 when the nest of the well-publicized red-tailed hawk Pale Male was removed from their Manhattan co-op building. Cohen, president of the co-op board, supported the removal; in 2001 Zahn had spoken approvingly of the hawk and its habit of feeding on rats and pigeons.

In April 2007, Zahn announced she was divorcing Cohen after 20 years of marriage. That same year, Zahn filed a lawsuit against Cohen alleging he had mismanaged 20 years&#x27; worth of her career earnings. The lawsuit was dismissed by the New York state court, ruling it &quot;is not a commercial case, rather, it is a matrimonial dispute masquerading as a commercial dispute.&quot;

Zahn played cello at Carnegie Hall in May 1992 with the New York Pops orchestra. She is also an honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, and has been an active advocate for issues of cancer awareness in general, and breast cancer in particular.

In May 2003, Zahn received an honorary degree from Dowling College of Oakdale, New York.

<doc id="521463" wikidata="Q2915355" url="?curid=521463" title="Key Largo">
<text>Key Largo () is an island in the upper Florida Keys archipelago and is the largest section of the keys, at long. It is one of the northernmost of the Florida Keys in Monroe County, and the northernmost of the keys connected by U.S. Highway 1 (the Overseas Highway). Three census-designated places (CDPs) are on the island of Key Largo: North Key Largo (near the Card Sound Bridge), Key Largo (roughly from the island&#x27;s southernmost point) and Tavernier (at the island&#x27;s south end). As of 2010, these three CDPs have a combined population of 13,850. None of Key Largo is an incorporated municipality; it is governed, at the local level, by Monroe County.

Key Largo is connected to the mainland of Miami-Dade County by two routes, the first being the Overseas Highway—the southernmost portion of U.S. Highway 1—which enters Key Largo at Jewfish Creek (near the middle of the island) before turning southwest. The second route is via Card Sound Road, which connects to the northern end of Key Largo and runs southeastward, connecting with County Road 905, which runs southwest and joins U.S. 1 at about mile marker 106. These routes originate at Florida City on the mainland.

Key Largo is a popular destination for many. It has been dubbed the &quot;Diving Capital of the World&quot; as the living coral reefs, a few miles offshore, attract thousands of scuba divers, sport-fishing enthusiasts and scientific researchers each year.

Key Largo&#x27;s proximity to the Everglades also makes it an ideal starting point for scientists, kayakers and ecotourists, among others. Automotive and highway pioneer (and Miami Beach developer) Carl G. Fisher built the Caribbean Club in 1938 as his last project.

Key Largo is situated between Everglades National Park, to the northwest, and John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, to the east, the first underwater park in the United States. The latter state park protects part of the Florida Reef, the only living coral barrier reef in the continental United States. Barrier reefs are critical to coastal communities and environments as they are able to dissipate up to 97% of the oceanic wave forces exerted during hurricanes and other tropical storms, with the reef serving as a protective buffer against flooding further inland. The barrier reef, itself, provides over $675 million in storm surge protection, annually.

==History==
When Europeans first arrived in the Florida Keys in the 16th century, the area was uninhabited or only sparsely inhabited by indigenous peoples such as the Calusa and the Tequesta. The earliest description of the area and its inhabitants was by Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, a survivor of a shipwreck who lived among the Calusa people from 1549 to 1566. The earliest reference to Key Largo is found on a map prepared in 1639 by Dutch cartographer Johannes Vingboons, in which it is named &quot;Caio des 12 Leguas&quot; (islet of twelve leagues). Some time later, it was named &quot;Cayo Largo&quot; — meaning long islet — by Spanish explorers.

In 1770, Dutch surveyor Bernard Romans reported that the area was uninhabited, although evidence was found that indigenous people visited the area from time to time. By the end of the Third Seminole War in 1858, the area was under control by the United States government, though it remained largely uninhabited. In 1870, a post office was established at &quot;Cayo Largo&quot; (in the current Rock Harbor area). It closed and another was opened called &quot;Largo&quot; in 1881. Additional post offices opened in Planter in 1891 and Aiken in 1895.

The island gained fame as the setting for the 1948 film &quot;Key Largo&quot;, but apart from background filming used for establishing shots, the film was shot on a Warner Bros. sound stage in Hollywood. After the film&#x27;s success, pressure from local businesses resulted in a change in the name of the post office serving the northern part of the island, from &quot;Rock Harbor&quot; to &quot;Key Largo&quot;, on June 1, 1952. After that, every resident north of Tavernier had a Key Largo address and the postmark read &quot;Key Largo&quot;.

==Geology and geography==
The island of Key Largo is an exposed, fossilized remnant of a coral reef formed during a period of higher sea level and then uncovered and eroded during a subsequent ice age. The highest elevation is a slight ridge forming the spine of the island, which rises to about .

The island&#x27;s substrate is called Key Largo Limestone; in many places, fossilized corals are visible at the surface. Solution holes, which are pockets dissolved in the limestone by acidic rainwater, form shallow depressions in the land. The natural shoreline of the island is generally rocky. A slippery, gray, limestone-based clay called &quot;marl&quot; is the shoreline and near-shore soil. No natural sand beaches occur on the island. Inland, decomposed vegetation forms a rich, acidic humus soil up to about 6 in (15 cm) thick, topped by &quot;leaf litter&quot;. The soil supports a diverse flora of herbaceous plants, woody shrubs, and hardwood trees.

==Climate==
Key Largo has a tropical savanna climate (Aw). Frost has never been recorded on the island. Key Largo enjoys close to 3,000 hours of sunshine annually.

<text>Lynmouth is a village in Devon, England, on the northern edge of Exmoor. The village straddles the confluence of the West Lyn and East Lyn rivers, in a gorge directly below the neighbouring town of Lynton, which was the only place to expand to once Lynmouth became as built-up as possible. The villages are connected by the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway, which works two cable-connected cars by gravity, using water tanks.

The two villages are a civil parish governed by Lynton and Lynmouth Town Council. The parish boundaries extend southwards from the coast, and include hamlets such as Barbrook and small moorland settlements such as East Ilkerton, West Ilkerton and Shallowford.

The South West Coast Path and Tarka Trail pass through, and the Two Moors Way runs from Ivybridge in South Devon to Lynmouth; the Samaritans Way South West runs from Bristol to Lynton, and the Coleridge Way from Nether Stowey to Lynmouth.

Lynmouth was described by Thomas Gainsborough, who honeymooned there with his bride Margaret Burr, as &quot;the most delightful place for a landscape painter this country can boast&quot;.

The Sillery Sands beach is just off the South West Coast Path and is used by naturists.

Percy Bysshe Shelley, his wife Harriet and his sister-in-law Eliza stayed in Lynmouth between June and August 1812. Shelley worked on political pamphlets and on the poem &quot;Queen Mab&quot;. He was delighted with the village.

== Lynmouth Lifeboat ==

A lifeboat station was established in Lynmouth on 20 January 1869, five months after the sailing vessel &quot;Home&quot; was wrecked nearby. The lifeboat was kept in a shed on the beach, until a purpose-built boat house was built at the harbour. This was rebuilt in 1898 and enlarged in 1906–07. It was closed at the end of 1944 because other stations in the area could provide cover with their newer motor lifeboats. The boat house was then used as a club, but was washed away in the flood of 15 August 1952. It has since been rebuilt, and now includes a public shelter.

At 7:52 pm on 12 January 1899, the 1,900 ton three-masted ship &quot;Forrest Hall&quot;, carrying thirteen crew and five apprentices, was in trouble off Porlock Weir on the north Somerset coast, owing to a severe gale that had been blowing all day. She had been under tow, but the tow rope had broken. She was dragging her anchor and had lost her steering gear. The ship&#x27;s destruction was probable. The alarm was raised for the &quot;Louisa&quot;, the Lynmouth lifeboat, to be launched to assist. However, launching was impossible because of the terrible weather. Jack Crocombe, the coxswain of the &quot;Louisa&quot;, proposed to take the boat by road to Porlock&#x27;s sheltered harbour, around the coast, and launch it from there.

The boat plus its carriage weighed about 10 tons, and transporting it would not be easy. 20 horses and 100 men started by hauling the boat up the 1 in 4 Countisbury Hill out of Lynmouth. Six of the men were sent ahead with picks and shovels to widen the road. The highest point is above sea level. After they had crossed the of wild Exmoor paths, they had to descend the dangerous Porlock Hill, with horses and men pulling ropes to stall the descent. During this, they had to demolish part of a garden wall and fell a large tree to make a way. The lifeboat reached Porlock Weir at 6:30 am, and was launched. Although cold, wet, hungry and exhausted, the crew rowed for over an hour in heavy seas to reach the stricken &quot;Forrest Hall&quot; and rescue the thirteen men and five apprentices with no casualties. However, four of the horses employed died of exhaustion. The &quot;Forrest Hall&quot; was towed into Barry, Wales. 

The feat was immortalised in C Walter Hodges&#x27; 1969 children&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Overland Launch&quot;, and was re-enacted 100 years after the event, in daylight, on today&#x27;s much better roads.

== 1952 Lynmouth flood ==

On 15 and 16 August 1952, a storm of tropical intensity broke over South West England, depositing of rain within 24 hours on an already waterlogged Exmoor. It is thought that a cold front scooped up a thunderstorm, and the orographic effect worsened the storm. Debris-laden floodwaters cascaded down the northern escarpment of the moor, converging upon the village of Lynmouth. In particular, in the upper West Lyn valley, a dam was formed by fallen trees and other debris; this in due course gave way, sending a huge wave of water and debris down that river. The River Lyn through the town had been culverted in order to gain land for business premises; this culvert soon choked with flood debris, and the river flowed through the town. Much of the debris was boulders and trees.

Overnight, over 100 buildings were destroyed or seriously damaged along with 28 of the 31 bridges, and 38 cars were washed out to sea. In total, 34 people died and a further 420 were made homeless.

Similar events had been recorded at Lynmouth in 1607 and 1796. After the 1952 disaster, the village was rebuilt, including diverting the river around the village.

A conspiracy theory has circulated that the 1952 flood was caused by secret cloud seeding experiments conducted by the RAF. Weather historian Philip Eden has described this theory as &quot;preposterous&quot;.

The small group of houses on the bank of the East Lyn River called Middleham, between Lynmouth and Watersmeet, was destroyed and never rebuilt. Today, a memorial garden stands on the site.

A memorial hall dedicated to the disaster is on the front toward the harbour; it contains photographs, newspaper reports and a scale model of the village, showing how it looked before the flood. A further photo and information display is found in St John the Baptist parish church.

The town of Lynton and Lynmouth is twinned with Bénouville in France.

==Cultural references==
In her poetical illustration &quot;Linmouth&quot;, to an engraving of a painting by Thomas Allom, Letitia Elizabeth Landon describes the beauties of rural nature but ends with the words: &#x27;Aye beautiful the dreaming brought By valleys and green fields; But deeper feeling, higher thought, Is what the city yields.&#x27; and in the footnote she speaks of her great love for London. Another of her poetical illustrations, again to a Thomas Allom picture but in a different vein, is 

The British technical modern rock band InMe make recurring references to the Lynton/Lynmouth area in their lyrical material. Lynton is mentioned in &quot;In Loving Memory&quot; on their third album &quot;Daydream Anonymous&quot;, and Lynmouth is mentioned in &quot;Saccharine Arcadia&quot; on &quot;&quot;. Lead singer Dave McPherson also has a song entitled &quot;Sunny Lynton&quot; on his EP &quot;Crescent Summer Sessions&quot; and refers to Watersmeet in &quot;Waltzing in a Supermarket&quot; on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Do Requests&quot;.

The village of Hollow Bay in &quot;The Secret of Crickley Hall&quot; by James Herbert is based on Lynmouth; Devil&#x27;s Cleave is based on the East Lyn Valley and Watersmeet. The book brings together two stories, that of child evacuees during the Second World War and that of the 1952 flood disaster that devastated Lynmouth.

Suzanne Goldring&#x27;s novel &quot;The Girl Without a Name&quot; features a woman who disappears during the 1952 Lynmouth flood while on holiday with her married lover. Like &quot;The Secret of Crickley Hall&quot;, part of the plot revolves around World War II child evacuees from London.

The Song &quot;13 Miles&quot; by the punk folk band Skinny Lister details the story of the 1899 Lynmouth lifeboat launch from Porlock; where a lifeboat had to be carried 13 miles over the moor due to poor weather conditions at Lynmouth Lifeboat Station. The launch saved all 18 souls stranded at sea.

==Transport==
Lynmouth is served by the following bus services:
*309/310 Lynton &amp; Lynmouth - Barnstaple (Filers)

==Sport==

The Lynton &amp; Lynmouth Cricket Club, founded in August 1876, meet at the Valley of the Rocks.

<doc id="521473" wikidata="Q14934759" url="?curid=521473" title="Balonne River">
<text>The Balonne River, part of the Murray-Darling Basin system, is a short yet significant part of the inland river group of South West Queensland, Australia.

==Course and features==
The river is a continuation of the Condamine River. After flowing through Surat the river flows south south-westerly down through the E.J. Beardmore Dam (Lake Kajarabie). Passing through St George it continues in the same south-west direction, until about north of Dirranbandi, where it branches, with the western branch then being called the Culgoa River. The eastern branch continues on as the Balonne River through Dirranbandi. Shortly after flowing through Dirranbandi, the Balonne River again branches into the Bokhara River on the west side (the right side when going down stream) and the Narran River on the eastern (left) side. The Narran River flows into Narran Wetlands. The Bokhara River joins with the Barwon River west of Brewarrina. The confluence of the Culgoa River (a western branch of the Balonne River) and the Barwon River (which includes a former central branch of the Balonne) forms the start of the Darling River.

The Balonne-Condamine catchment area is , of which an area of is composed of riverine wetlands and is estuarine wetlands.

The five longest tributaries of the Balonne River are the Condamine River, the Maranoa River, Dogwood Creek, Yuleba Creek and Tartulla Creek. At St George, the river is crossed by the Andrew Nixon Bridge which carries the Balonne Highway.

===Water storage===

E.J. Beardmore Dam was formed by the construction of a weir in 1972 at the junction of the Maranoa and Balonne Rivers. When the dam is full the water backs up for along the Balonne. Downstream from Beardmore Dam is the Jack Taylor Weir, which was built in 1953. On the Balonne tributary, Dogwood Creek there is another weir, the Gill Weir, which can hold .

==History==
Major Thomas Mitchell crossed the Balonne River on St George&#x27;s Day, 23 April 1846. Mitchell named the river after the Mandandanji word for water or running stream, &quot;balun&quot; or &quot;balonn&quot; or &quot;balonne&quot;.

<text>San Antonio ( ; Spanish for &quot;Saint Anthony&quot;), officially the Municipality of San Antonio (; ; Sambal: &quot;Babali nin San Antonio&quot;), is a municipality in the province of Zambales, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 37,450 people.

San Antonio is from Iba and from Manila.

==History==
San Antonio was a hunting region where indigenous hunters from the northern towns of Zambales would hunt, and gather. The first settlers from the Paoay area in Ilocos Norte arrived in 1830, and founded the first Spanish settlement that developed into what is now San Antonio.

San Antonio was given the status of district or barrio in 1836. The town mayor in that period was Don Gregorio Banaga. He governed the town from 1836 to 1849. He was succeeded by Don Vicente Lacuesta in 1849, from Teniente Primero to Teniente Absoluto. The last mayor was Don Santiago Ladrillono. He was succeeded by Don Dimas Pascasio as governor in 1856. They selected their leaders every year. In 1891 to 1898, Don Pablo Corpus was the only Capitan Municipal selected then appointed Don Felix Magsaysay as the first President municipal, and many more followed up to 1931 to 1945.

The town was the site of the United States Navy Base known as the U.S. Naval Communications Station San Miguel. After the earthquake and eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, the United States Military decided to abandon its military bases in the Philippines.

== Economy ==
==Tourism==
San Antonio is increasingly known for its beaches, mountains and coves, and is a destination for campers and beach goers.


* Casa San Miguel: Founded by violinist Coke Bolipata, the community center provides its members the time and space for developing their interest and talent in classical music.
*Tiklados Applied Music Center (Tiklados): Located at Barangay Antipolo, it was founded by Dr. Ceferino Cariaso III in 2002, to tutor young pianists and guitarists. The center caters to the following instruments: piano, violin, guitar, organ, flute, and voice. Solfege and music theory are also offered in the center. At present, Tiklados has three piano rooms, one violin/voice room, a spacious faculty and staff lounge, and a 60-seater concert hall.
*Pundaquit: Nestled in the navel of the Zambales coastline, a Spanish Light House from the 1800s is found atop the &quot;Islas de Punta Capones.&quot; This is reminiscent of places such as &quot;Sierra Leone.&quot; Zambales is also home to the famous Crystal Beach surf in the town of San Narciso. This surf spot is known as a &quot;surfing paradise&quot; closest to Manila.
*Redondo Peninsula: A short mountainous peninsula extending about 15 kilometers (9 miles) to the south of Zambales on western Luzon in the Philippines. It separates Subic Bay and the coasts around the Subic Bay Metropolitan Area of Subic and Olongapo from the South China Sea. It is known for its secluded coves, beaches and pine-forested mountains.
*Anawangin Cove: It is a crescent shaped cove with a pristine white sand beach. What makes the place unique is the unusual riddle of tall pine-like trees flourishing round its vicinity. In fact they are not pine trees; they are agoho trees, a species endemic to the Philippines, some Southeast Asian countries and north-eastern parts of Australia. There are no roads leading to Anawangin. It is only accessible by a 30-minute boat ride from Pundaquit, San Antonio, or by a six-hour trek through hot, open trails thru the Pundaquit range. The cove&#x27;s relative isolation has kept it free from development. Just behind the beach is the pine forest and a marsh, where there are natural springs feeding to the sea. The area is home to a number of bird species.

San Antonio, influenced by the presence of the United States Naval Communication Station in the late &#x27;50s, is the baseball and softball capital of Zambales. Mayor Zozimo Pascasio and the Holy Name Society adopted the program in the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s. Their partnership produced players who became athletic scholars in various colleges and universities in Manila. In the early &#x27;80s, JJ Henry &amp; Chuck Jones of FRA Branch 367 (US Navy retirees) living in San Antonio, further enhanced the enthusiasm for the sport through the Shipmates, a team of 10- to 12-year-old boys coming from the different barangays who competed in the PABA (Philippine Amateur Baseball Association) Invitational. In 1985, the core of the team intact &amp; playing for TR Yangco Educational Institute, the Shipmates coached by Butch Echiverre, won the baseball gold in the CLRAA (Central Luzon Regional Athletic Association), a first for Zambales. The San Antonio &quot;TNT&quot; Jaycees, most of whom are employees at the US Navy base, continued the program with their annual San Antonio Summer Baseball Cup successfully.

After the eruption of Mt Pinatubo in 1991, due to the destruction of the playing fields and the withdrawal of the US bases, support for the baseball program dwindled. Eager to find an alternative sports activity, Butch Echiverre and some friends introduced darts to the community. From its humble beginnings at a place called &quot;Kubo,&quot; presently, the Zambales Darters Federation is considered as one of the best dart organizations in the country for having hosted several national competitions. Its &quot;no-school, no-play&quot; policy is now adopted nationwide and the NDFP (National Darts Federation of the Philippines) conferred the President&#x27;s Award to the group during the Darterong Pinoy 2012.

The community&#x27;s love for baseball was rekindled in the late &#x27;90s after losing the provincial baseball crown to Botolan, Zambales. The SADTEA (San Antonio District Teachers &amp; Employees Association) took the initiative of organizing an inter-school tournament. This time, a softball tournament for girls is included. Supported by some officials of the local government and equipment donated by San Antonians locally &amp; abroad, San Antonio baseball/softball is better than it ever was. As a member of the Little League Asia Pacific Region, San Antonio has always reached the quarterfinals of the Philippine Series. Irwin Mata is the Little League President of San Antonio.

Aside from fast becoming a surfing capital of Luzon, San Antonio has an 18-hole golf course at the Naval Education and Training Command of the Philippine Navy (formerly US Naval Communication Station).

<text>Hipercor S.A. is an upscale chain of hypermarkets in Spain, belonging to the same group as El Corte Inglés. It has its head office in the El Corte Inglés head office building in Madrid.

Hipercor generally stocks a wide range of household and food products across large floorspaces (1 or 2 storeys) and are usually located as part of the same building complexes (styled as centro commercial) as the El Corte Inglés department store. The first Hipercor hypermarket was inaugurated on 5 September 1980 in Seville.

Other &#x27;Cor&#x27; supermarkets include SuperCor (average sized units) and OpenCor, smaller convenience stores that open all year round from 07/08:00 and closing at 01/02:00 the following morning.

On 19 June 1987, a car bomb exploded in the underground car park of a Hipercor supermarket in Barcelona, killing 21 civilians and injuring 45, amongst them several small children. Santiago Arrospide, also known as Santi Potros, and Rafael Caride Simon were sentenced to 790 years in prison for their role in the attack. Both Arrospide and Simon were members of the Basque separatist group ETA.

<doc id="521487" wikidata="Q247524" url="?curid=521487" title="Gerald Regan">
<text>Gerald Augustine Paul Regan (February 13, 1928 – November 26, 2019) was a Canadian politician (as federal MP and later as Nova Scotia MLA), who served as the 19th premier of Nova Scotia from 1970 to 1978.

==Early life and education==
Regan was born in Windsor, Nova Scotia, of partial Irish descent, the son of Rose Mary (née Greene) and Walter Edward Regan. He graduated from Dalhousie Law School and was admitted to the Nova Scotia Barristers&#x27; Society in 1954.

==Legal career==
He became one of the region&#x27;s best known labour lawyers, and his high-profile image led to an invitation to enter politics.

==Political career==
He was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1963 federal election. He resigned his seat in 1965 when he was named leader of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party. Regan entered the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in 1967, and aggressively pursued the government of Premier George Isaac Smith as Leader of the opposition. Regan led a fourteen-hour filibuster against the government&#x27;s plans to increase the sales tax in 1969.

Regan&#x27;s Liberals won a minority government in 1970, and were re-elected with a majority in 1974.

As premier, Regan supported industrialization and the development of offshore gas and oil. His first government amended the province&#x27;s labour code to prevent courts from issuing injunctions to prevent picketing in labour disputes, and the office of the provincial ombudsman was established. In its second term, the Regan government nationalized the Nova Scotia Light and Power electrical utility, and consolidated electricity supply under the Nova Scotia Power Corporation. A massive plan for the development of tidal power in the Bay of Fundy was also announced.

His government was defeated by John Buchanan&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Party in the 1978 general election, in part due to the oil shock&#x27;s effect on the economy.

Regan returned to the federal House of Commons in the 1980 federal election, and was appointed Minister of Labour and Minister of State for International Trade in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Regan was defeated along with the Liberal government in the 1984 election.

==Criminal charges and controversy==
On October 27, 1993, CBC News revealed that the RCMP were investigating Regan for sexual misconduct. In March 1995 and May 1995 he was charged with a total of nineteen counts of sexual offences. As of April 2, 1998, there were eighteen charges, but nine were stayed by Justice J. Michael MacDonald of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.

Regan ultimately faced trial on eight charges including rape, attempted rape and forcible confinement, for crimes allegedly committed in 1956 and 1969 against victims aged 14 and 18 at the time. On December 18, 1998, he was acquitted on all eight charges by a jury.

On September 10, 1999, by a margin of 2–1, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal reinstated the nine stayed charges regarding alleged incidents in the mid-1960s and &#x27;70s involving girls and women aged 14 to 24 at the time; two were later dropped, but the others were to be tried together with the other remaining charge. The ruling reinstating the charges was upheld in a 5–4 decision by the Supreme Court of Canada in February 2002. But in April 2002, the crown attorney&#x27;s office announced that it would not continue prosecution on the remaining charges of sexual assault due to the age of the allegations, the cost and the age of the defendant.

==Personal life==
Regan&#x27;s wife was Anita Carole Thomas (Harrison), whose father, John Harrison, was a Saskatchewan Liberal Member of Parliament. They had six children, including Geoff Regan, 36th Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, who also served as Minister of Fisheries and Oceans in the government of Paul Martin from 2000 until 2006, and who served as MP for Halifax West; Nancy Regan, a local television personality with ATV; and Laura Regan, an actress.

Regan died on November 26, 2019, at the age of 91.

<doc id="521492" wikidata="Q963114" url="?curid=521492" title="Lisbon Strategy">
<text>The Lisbon Strategy, also known as the Lisbon Agenda or Lisbon Process, was an action and development plan devised in 2000, for the economy of the European Union between 2000 and 2010. A pivotal role in its formulation was played by the Portuguese economist Maria João Rodrigues.

Its aim was to make the EU &quot;the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion&quot;, by 2010. It was set out by the European Council in Lisbon in March 2000. By 2010, most of its goals were not achieved. It has been succeeded by the Europe 2020 strategy.

==Background and objectives==
The Lisbon Strategy intended to deal with the low productivity and stagnation of economic growth in the EU, through the formulation of various policy initiatives to be taken by all EU member states. The broader objectives set out by the Lisbon strategy were to be attained by 2010.

It was adopted for a ten-year period in 2000 in Lisbon, Portugal by the European Council. It broadly aimed to &quot;make Europe, by 2010, the most competitive and the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world&quot;.

===Strategy===
The main fields were economic, social, and environmental renewal and sustainability. The Lisbon Strategy was heavily based on the economic concepts of:

* Innovation as the motor for economic change (based on the writings of Joseph Schumpeter)
* The &quot;learning economy&quot;
* Social and environmental renewal

Under the strategy, a stronger economy would create employment in the EU, alongside inclusive social and environmental policies, which would themselves drive economic growth even further.

An EU research group found in 2005 that current progress had been judged &quot;unconvincing&quot;, so a reform process was introduced wherein all goals would be reviewed every three years, with assistance provided on failing items.

Translation of the Lisbon Strategy goals into concrete measures led to the extension of the Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development (FPs) into FP7 and the Joint Technology Initiatives (JTI).

===Key thinkers and concepts===
Contemporary key thinkers on whose works the Lisbon Strategy was based and/or who were involved in its creation include Maria João Rodrigues, Christopher Freeman, Bengt-Åke Lundvall, Luc Soete, Daniele Archibugi Carlota Perez, Manuel Castells, Giovanni Dosi, and Richard Nelson.

Key concepts of the Lisbon Strategy include those of the knowledge economy, innovation, techno-economic paradigms, technology governance, and the &quot;open method of coordination&quot; (OMC).

==Midterm review==
Between April and November 2004, Wim Kok headed up a review of the program and presented a report on the Lisbon strategy concluding that even if some progress was made, most of the goals were not achieved:

The European Commission used this report as a basis for its proposal in February 2005 to refocus the Lisbon Agenda on actions that promote growth and jobs in a manner that is fully consistent with the objective of sustainable development. The Commission&#x27;s communication stated that &quot;making growth and jobs the immediate target goes hand in hand with promoting social or environmental objectives.&quot;

In its resolution on the midterm review of the Lisbon strategy in March 2005, the European Parliament expressed its belief that &quot;sustainable growth and employment are Europe&#x27;s most pressing goals and underpin social and environmental progress&quot; and &quot;that well-designed social and environmental policies are themselves key elements in strengthening Europe&#x27;s economic performance&quot;.

These declarations were classed as unrealistic by some, and the failure of the &quot;relaunch&quot; initiative was predicted if the existing approach was not changed.

==Closing review==
In 2009 Swedish prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt admitted:

The alleged failure of the Lisbon Strategy was widely commented on in the news and by member states leaders.

Spain&#x27;s prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero pointed out that the non-binding character of the Lisbon Strategy contributed to the failure, and this lesson needed to be taken into account by the new Europe 2020 strategy.

Official appraisal of the Lisbon Strategy took place in March 2010 at a European Summit, where the new Europe 2020 strategy was also launched.

<text>The (JT) is a Japanese diversified tobacco company. It was established in 1985 as a that inherited the right to monopolize and manufacture cigarettes from the Japan Tobacco and Salt Public Corporation and required the government to hold at least 50% of its shares. In addition to tobacco, JT diversified its businesses, establishing the pharmaceutical research institute in 1993 and making a full-scale entry into the food and beverage industry in 1998. In 2008, it acquired the food manufacturer Katokichi, now TableMark, as a wholly-owned subsidiary, integrating its food business.

It is part of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Large70 indices. In 2009 the company was listed at number 312 on the Fortune 500 list. The company is headquartered in Toranomon, Minato, Tokyo, and Japan Tobacco International&#x27;s headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland. As of 2012 the chairman is Hiroshi Kimura and the CEO is Mitsuomi Koizumi.

==History==
Japan Tobacco is the successor entity to a nationalized tobacco monopoly first established by the Government of Japan in 1898 to secure tax revenue collections from tobacco leaf sales. In 1904, the government&#x27;s leaf monopoly was extended completely to take over all tobacco business operations in the nation, including all manufactured tobacco products such as cigarettes. The ostensible reason for the expansion of control was to help fund the 1904–1905 Russo-Japanese War, but because all foreign tobacco interests in Japan at the time were forcibly evicted under the monopolization scheme, this also protected the domestic tobacco business for the following eighty years.

The business operated within the Japanese government as an arm of the nation&#x27;s Japanese Ministry of Finance until 1949 when the was established to enforce restrictive labor relations policies under the U.S. and allied forces&#x27; Occupation of Japan. The Japan Tobacco and Salt Public Corporation remained a complete state monopoly under direct Japanese Ministry of Finance authority until 1985, when Japan Tobacco, Inc. was formed as a publicly traded stock company. Periodic incremental sales of share to the public began in October 1994. Japan Tobacco became two-thirds owned by the Japanese Ministry of Finance in June 2003, and the ministry continued to own 50% until March 2013. It was announced in May 2012 that the government would sell one-sixth of the company&#x27;s outstanding shares to raise ¥500 billion to finance reconstruction from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. In 2013 the Japanese government disclosed the details of its plans to reduce its equity interest in Japan Tobacco by $10 billion, devoting the proceeds to reconstruction in northeastern Japan. The ministry of finance sold the stock in March 2013, selling about 333 million of the 1 billion shares it owned at that time. The government remains required by law to own at least one-third of JT&#x27;s stock.

==JT today==
Japan Tobacco has 66.4% of the cigarette market in Japan. Although tobacco consumption is declining, the Japanese remain heavy smokers, consuming an average of 1,800 cigarettes per capita in 2013, compared to about 1,000 per capita in the United States.

In April 2012 it was announced that Mitsuomi Koizumi would become president, and president Hiroshi Kimura would become chairman of JT. and Chairman Yoji Wakui would retire. Wakui had previously been a bureaucrat at the ministry of finance. Koizumi assuming the presidency meant that for the first time since the 1985 privatization neither president nor chairman was from the Ministry of Finance. Koizumi, who had been Executive Deputy President, became president in June 2012.

On 30 October 2013 JT announced that it would close four Japanese factories and cut 1,600 jobs in Japan through voluntary retirements. This was planned to be completed by March 2016. JT also planned to consolidate 25 branch offices into 15 regional headquarters, and close leaf-processing and vending machine operations.

Japan Tobacco also operates in foods, pharmaceuticals, agribusiness, engineering, and real estate. It left the beverage industry in September 2015. As part of the company&#x27;s pharma activities, it divested a compound collection of potassium channel inhibitors to Metrion Biosciences in 2018.

==Japan Tobacco International==
JT International (JTI), acquired in 1999 from R.J. Reynolds, is an operating division of Japan Tobacco Inc., and produces, markets and sells the group&#x27;s cigarette brands internationally. It sells Camel, Salem, and Winston brands outside the USA.

Japan Tobacco completed the largest ever foreign takeover in Japanese history through acquisition of Gallaher Group plc in April 2007. Japan Tobacco runs the Tobacco and Salt Museum in Sumida-ku, Tokyo.

In 2006/2007 Japan Tobacco planned to start Serbia production, and also planned to invest another $100 million. JT paid &quot;$35 million euros&quot; for 98.5 percent of Senta Tobacco Industry in May 2006, with a further $10 million invested since then. The plant has a production capacity of some five billion cigarettes a year.

On 12 June 2014 JT concluded an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of British e-cigarettes producer &quot;Zandera Ltd&quot;, best known for its E-Lites brand. On 30 April 2015 JT announced it had agreed to buy Florida-based e-cigarette maker &quot;Logic Technology Development LLC&quot;.

In September 2015 it was announced that JT would buy the rights for Natural American Spirit outside the US for $5 billion.

In August 2017, the company announced it would acquire the Indonesian Kretek producers &quot;Karyadibya Mahardhika&quot; and &quot;Surya Mustika Nusantara&quot; from Gudang Garam for $677 million. PT Karya Dibya Mahardhika has a main brand in Indonesia, Apache, Extreme Mild, &amp; Minna International. 
After that, the Philippines&#x27; Mighty Corporation for $936 million.

In 2018, JT acquired Donskoy Tabak corporation, Russia&#x27;s fourth largest cigarette manufacturer for $1.6 billion.

==Lawsuits==
There have been a number of Japanese court cases related to smoking, either directly or indirectly related to JT.

===1980–1987 JNR Shinkansen lawsuit===
A group of nonsmokers sued at the Tokyo District Court demanding that Japanese National Railways shinkansen (bullet trains) provide more non-smoking cars. The case was filed in 1980 and while the court recognized tobacco&#x27;s health risks the 27 March 1987 ruling rejected the lawsuit on the basis that the plaintiffs had failed to prove their harm to be &quot;beyond the limits of toleration&quot;.

===1998–2005 Tokyo lawsuit===
In 1998 seven plaintiffs represented by lawyer Yoshio Isayama sued JT at the Tokyo District Court for ¥70 million compensation (¥10 million per plaintiff) for health damage caused by smoking JT cigarettes. While similar cases had been filed in Nagoya, this was the first such case in Tokyo. In addition to financial compensation, the plaintiffs also demanded:
* That tobacco sales through vending machines be banned;
* That advertising on television and radio be stopped;
* That promotions at public and sports events be halted;
* That a more stringent warning label be printed on cigarette boxes.

The plaintiffs&#x27; case was dismissed by the district court on 21 October 2003. The court agreed with the 1980s ruling that tobacco had health risks, but said that there was no causal link between the smoking habits and the specific diseases of plaintiffs. In addition, Judge Kikuo Asaka denied that nicotine was highly addictive. Isayama said that the group would appeal the decision to the Tokyo High Court.

On 22 June 2005 the Tokyo High Court dismissed the case; by that time brought by only six plaintiffs. Three of the plaintiffs had died during the course of the case. Judge Toshinobu Akiyama said he agreed with the District Court decision. Jun Araki, the son of one of the deceased plaintiffs, said: &quot;This ruling placed priority on the annual 2.3 trillion yen in [tobacco] tax revenue over the precious lives and health of the Japanese people&quot;. He also said the plaintiffs would appeal to the Supreme Court.

===2005–2010 Yokohama lawsuit===
In January 2005 plaintiffs Kenichi Morishita, Koreyoshi Takahashi, and Masanobu Mizuno filed a case in the Yokohama District Court against JT seeking ¥30 million in damages for smoking related illness. Morishita died of pneumonia while the case was being fought, and JT used the same argument as in the 1998–2005 Tokyo case, that smokers were free to quit any time and that cancer and other illnesses had multiple causes.

On 20 January 2010 the court clearly ruled that there was a link between smoking and lung cancer and respiratory illnesses, and said that smoking may be addictive. However, the court rejected the demand for damages, and said that the plaintiffs had smoked of their own free will and that there was no proof that smoking had directly caused their sicknesses.

==Smoking etiquette posters==

JTI runs a series of posters designed to educate smokers about smoking etiquette. They can be seen widely around Japan, especially located near train stations. Poster gallery 

==Environmental record==
In 2008, Japan Tobacco had health issues involving their company: Contaminated gyoza dumplings made by a Chinese company&#x27;s factory in China, which sold its products to JT, poisoned ten people, including a five-year-old girl. Thousands of other Japanese people were going to the hospital because of stomach issues as well. A number of dumplings were found containing dichlorvos and methamidophos from pesticide. The health minister of Japan said the contamination at the Chinese factory was possibly intentional, and the police are investigating for an attempted homicide. The dumplings were from China, but Japan Tobacco has said it does not plan to cease its manufacturing in China. Frozen food sales went down by 60% for the business since this health scare. Japan Tobacco&#x27;s stock price fell 7.1% after they were forced to recall their products, and the company also lost a $500 million merger deal with Nissin Foods because of this incident.

== Anti-illicit trade compliance ==
Japan Tobacco Inc, through its international operating divisions JT International S.A. and JT International Holding BV, signed a Cooperation Agreement with the European Commission in 2007 to combat the illicit trade in cigarettes under Article 9 of which the company agreed to &quot;pro-actively disclose&quot; to the European Commission&#x27;s Anti-Fraud Office (Office Europeen de Lutte Antifraude – OLAF) &quot;...all material information coming into (its) possession after the Execution Date relating to potentially Illegal Product.&quot; The Agreement defines &quot;Illegal Product&quot; as Contraband or Counterfeit Cigarettes. Both Japan Tobacco Inc and JT International S.A. claim to adhere to a &quot;zero-tolerance approach&quot; to illicit trade.

JT International S.A. and several of its distributors, including Megapolis in Russia and IBCS Trading in Cyprus, however, have been implicated as recently as 2011 in widespread smuggling to include selling cigarettes to a buyer in Syria subject to EU, Swiss, and US Sanctions and diverting cigarettes from Russia into the European Union and smuggling Winston and other popular cigarette brands into Iran. A JT International S.A. executive told the Wall Street Journal in August 2012 that the firm had continued to ship cigarettes to Syria until as recently as February 2012, almost a full year after the imposition of EU and US sanctions. The Journal cited Syrian dissident sources who claimed that the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad uses cigarettes as payment for the irregular military forces and militias, known as the shabeeha, who have had a central role in its violent crackdown.

Company documents show that in 2010 the head of the JT International SA security office – who performed a similar function at the former Gallaher Group PLC – sought to destroy evidence linking up to 13 company officers to smugglers in the Balkans region; a parallel effort was then being run by company management to hack into the emails of company anti-smuggling investigators, competitors, and law enforcement.

The firm also announced in 2011 that it had purchased the largest cigarette producer in Sudan and South Sudan as part of an effort to expand sales in the war-torn region, which has emerged as an entrepot for cigarette smuggling.

<text>In computer science, priority inversion is a scenario in scheduling in which a high-priority task is indirectly superseded by a lower-priority task, effectively inverting the assigned priorities of the tasks. This violates the priority model that high-priority tasks can only be prevented from running by higher-priority tasks. Inversion occurs when there is a resource contention with a low-priority task that is then preempted by a medium-priority task.

== Formulation ==
Consider two tasks &quot;H&quot; and &quot;L&quot;, of high and low priority respectively, either of which can acquire exclusive use of a shared resource &quot;R&quot;. If &quot;H&quot; attempts to acquire &quot;R&quot; after &quot;L&quot; has acquired it, then &quot;H&quot; becomes blocked until &quot;L&quot; relinquishes the resource. Sharing an exclusive-use resource (&quot;R&quot; in this case) in a well-designed system typically involves &quot;L&quot; relinquishing &quot;R&quot; promptly so that &quot;H&quot; (a higher-priority task) does not stay blocked for excessive periods of time. Despite good design, however, it is possible that a third task &quot;M&quot; of medium priority becomes runnable during &quot;L&quot;&#x27;s use of &quot;R&quot;. At this point, &quot;M&quot; being higher in priority than &quot;L&quot;, preempts &quot;L&quot; (since &quot;M&quot; does not depend on &quot;R&quot;), causing &quot;L&quot; to not be able to relinquish &quot;R&quot; promptly, in turn causing &quot;H&quot;—the highest-priority process—to be unable to run (that is, &quot;H&quot; suffers unexpected blockage indirectly caused by lower-priority tasks like &quot;M&quot;).

==Consequences==
In some cases, priority inversion can occur without causing immediate harm—the delayed execution of the high-priority task goes unnoticed, and eventually, the low-priority task releases the shared resource. However, there are also many situations in which priority inversion can cause serious problems. If the high-priority task is left starved of the resources, it might lead to a system malfunction or the triggering of pre-defined corrective measures, such as a watchdog timer resetting the entire system. The trouble experienced by the Mars Pathfinder lander in 1997 is a classic example of problems caused by priority inversion in realtime systems.

Priority inversion can also reduce the perceived performance of the system. Low-priority tasks usually have a low priority because it is not important for them to finish promptly (for example, they might be a batch job or another non-interactive activity). Similarly, a high-priority task has a high priority because it is more likely to be subject to strict time constraints—it may be providing data to an interactive user, or acting subject to real-time response guarantees. Because priority inversion results in the execution of a lower-priority task blocking the high-priority task, it can lead to reduced system responsiveness or even the violation of response time guarantees.

A similar problem called deadline interchange can occur within earliest deadline first scheduling (EDF).

==Solutions==
The existence of this problem has been known since the 1970s. Lampson and Redell published one of the first papers to point out the priority inversion problem. Systems such as the UNIX kernel were already addressing the problem with the splx() primitive. There is no foolproof method to predict the situation. There are however many existing solutions, of which the most common ones are:

;Disabling all interrupts to protect critical sections
:When disabling interrupts is used to prevent priority inversion, there are only two priorities: &quot;preemptible&quot;, and &quot;interrupts disabled.&quot; With no third priority, inversion is impossible. Since there&#x27;s only one piece of lock data (the interrupt-enable bit), misordering locking is impossible, and so deadlocks cannot occur. Since the critical regions always run to completion, hangs do not occur. Note that this only works if all interrupts are disabled. If only a particular hardware device&#x27;s interrupt is disabled, priority inversion is reintroduced by the hardware&#x27;s prioritization of interrupts. In early versions of UNIX, a series of primitives named splx(0) ... splx(7) disabled all interrupts up through the given priority. By properly choosing the highest priority of any interrupt that ever entered the critical section, the priority inversion problem could be solved without locking out all of the interrupts. Ceilings were assigned in rate-monotonic order, i.e. the slower devices had lower priorities.
:In multiple CPU systems, a simple variation, &quot;single shared-flag locking&quot; is used. This scheme provides a single flag in shared memory that is used by all CPUs to lock all inter-processor critical sections with a busy-wait. Interprocessor communications are expensive and slow on most multiple CPU systems. Therefore, most such systems are designed to minimize shared resources. As a result, this scheme actually works well on many practical systems. These methods are widely used in simple embedded systems, where they are prized for their reliability, simplicity and low resource use. These schemes also require clever programming to keep the critical sections very brief. Many software engineers consider them impractical in general-purpose computers.

;Priority ceiling protocol
:With priority ceiling protocol, the shared mutex process (that runs the operating system code) has a characteristic (high) priority of its own, which is assigned to the task of locking the mutex. This works well, provided the other high-priority task(s) that tries to access the mutex does not have a priority higher than the ceiling priority.

;Priority inheritance
:Under the policy of priority inheritance, whenever a high-priority task has to wait for some resource shared with an executing low-priority task, the low-priority task is temporarily assigned the priority of the highest waiting priority task for the duration of its own use of the shared resource, thus keeping medium priority tasks from pre-empting the (originally) low priority task, and thereby affecting the waiting high priority task as well. Once the resource is released, the low-priority task continues at its original priority level.

;Random boosting
:Ready tasks holding locks are randomly boosted in priority until they exit the critical section. This solution was used in Microsoft Windows until it was replaced by AutoBoost a form of priority inheritance.

;Avoid blocking
:Because priority inversion involves a low-priority task blocking a high-priority task, one way to avoid priority inversion is to avoid blocking, for example by using non-blocking algorithms such as read-copy-update.

<text>Bar-Ilan University (BIU, , &quot;Universitat Bar-Ilan&quot;) is a public research university in the Tel Aviv District city of Ramat Gan, Israel. Established in 1955, Bar Ilan is Israel&#x27;s second-largest academic university institution. It has 20,000 students and 1,350 faculty members.

Bar-Ilan&#x27;s mission is to &quot;blend Jewish tradition with modern technologies and scholarship and the university endeavors to ... teach the Jewish heritage to all its students while providing [an] academic education.&quot; The university is among the best in the Middle East in the fields of computer science, engineering, engineering physics and applied physics. In 2024, the university was donated $260 million, one of the biggest donations to a university in Israeli history.

==History==


Bar-Ilan University has Jewish-American roots: It was conceived in Atlanta in a meeting of the American Mizrahi organization in 1950, and was founded by Professor Pinkhos Churgin, an American Orthodox rabbi and educator, who was president from 1955 to 1957 where he was succeeded by Joseph H. Lookstein who was president from 1957 to 1967. When it was opened in 1955, it was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;as Cultural Link Between the [Israeli] Republic and America&quot;. Presidents who followed were Max Jammer (1967–77), Emanuel Rackman (1977–86), Michael Albeck (1986–89), Ernest Krausz (1989), Zvi Arad (1989–92), and Shlomo Eckstein (1992–96).

The university was named for Rabbi Meir Bar-Ilan (originally &quot;Meir Berlin&quot;), a Religious Zionist leader who served as the inspiration for its establishment. Although he was trained in Orthodox seminaries in Berlin, he believed there was a need for an institution providing a dual curriculum of secular academic studies and religious Torah studies.

BIU&#x27;s student population is diverse and includes both Jewish and non-Jewish students.

Jewish students must take at least five courses in Jewish studies in order to graduate; non-Jewish students can choose general courses instead. These are available as academic Jewish studies courses, as well as through more traditional Torah study, offered primarily by the &quot;Machon HaGavoah LeTorah&quot;, established in the 1970s. The &quot;Machon&quot; operates a Kollel / Bet midrash for men, and a Midrasha for women. The Kollel offers traditional yeshiva studies with an emphasis on Talmud and Halakha (Jewish law), while the midrasha offers courses in &quot;Tanakh&quot; (The Bible), practical Halakha, and &quot;Machshavah&quot; (Jewish philosophy). The Midrasha is the largest in Israel. These programs are open to all students free of charge.

Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s convicted assassin, Yigal Amir, was a student of law and computer science at Bar-Ilan, prompting charges that the university had become a hotbed of political extremism. One of the steps taken by the university following the 1995 assassination was to encourage dialogue between left-wing and right-wing students.

Under university president Moshe Kaveh (1996–2013), Bar-Ilan underwent a major expansion, with new buildings added on the northern side of the campus. New science programs have been introduced, including a multidisciplinary brain research center and a center for nanotechnology. The university has placed archaeology as one of its priorities, and this includes excavations such as the Tell es-Safi/Gath archaeological excavations and the recently opened Bar-Ilan University/Weizmann Institute of Science joint program in Archaeological Sciences.

Bar-Ilan&#x27;s Faculty of Law made headlines in 2008 by achieving the highest average Israeli bar exam grade of 81.9 by its graduates. Daniel Hershkowitz was university president from 2013 to 2017.

Arie Zaban was elected as the president of the university in 2017.

In June 2024, the university received a $260 million donation from the estate of an anonymous American donor, the largest bequest in the university&#x27;s history and the second largest ever to an Israeli university. The donation is earmarked for science and technology, specifically to recruit researchers, build laboratories, and create partnerships.

==Academics==
Bar-Ilan University has nine faculties: Exact Sciences, Life Sciences, Social Sciences, Education, Humanities, Jewish Studies, Medicine, Engineering, and Law. There is also a special Unit of Interdisciplinary Studies. At the undergraduate level, as mentioned, ten courses in Jewish studies related subjects are required from all students.

Bar-Ilan offers several special programs, including its international B.A. program, taught entirely in English, and is the first university in Israel to offer a full undergraduate program taught entirely in English. Currently, students can choose between a B.A. degree in interdisciplinary social sciences, where students can choose between a macro track in economics, political sciences, and sociology, or the Micro Track in Criminology, Psychology, and Sociology, or a major in communications, with a minor in either English literature or political science. The degrees are internationally recognized and are open to students from all over the world.

In addition, Bar-Ilan offers a preparatory program that readies new immigrants for Israeli colleges. The university also runs a one-year overseas program called &quot;Torah Im Derech Eretz Program&quot;, which combines traditional Kollel Torah studies in the morning, separate for men and women, as well as co-ed general university studies and Jewish history classes in the afternoon. Many American students enrolled in regular programs of study in the university also take these Jewish history classes to fulfill their Jewish studies requirements.

Bar-Ilan also houses several research institutions such as the above-mentioned Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center, focused on neuroscience, which may have their own requirements.

==Awards and recognition==
The Bar Ilan Responsa Project was awarded the Israel Prize in 2007. The university&#x27;s Bible project, in danger of being eliminated by continued budget cuts, was saved at the last minute by an anonymous donor.

In its capacity as a business school, Bar-Ilan was placed as the fourth best business school in Africa and the Middle East in the 2010 QS Global 200 Business Schools Report.

<text>A resonator is a device or system that exhibits resonance or resonant behavior. That is, it naturally oscillates with greater amplitude at some frequencies, called resonant frequencies, than at other frequencies. The oscillations in a resonator can be either electromagnetic or mechanical (including acoustic). Resonators are used to either generate waves of specific frequencies or to select specific frequencies from a signal. Musical instruments use acoustic resonators that produce sound waves of specific tones. Another example is quartz crystals used in electronic devices such as radio transmitters and quartz watches to produce oscillations of very precise frequency.
A cavity resonator is one in which waves exist in a hollow space inside the device. In electronics and radio, microwave cavities consisting of hollow metal boxes are used in microwave transmitters, receivers and test equipment to control frequency, in place of the tuned circuits which are used at lower frequencies. Acoustic cavity resonators, in which sound is produced by air vibrating in a cavity with one opening, are known as Helmholtz resonators.

==Explanation==

A physical system can have as many resonant frequencies as it has degrees of freedom; each degree of freedom can vibrate as a harmonic oscillator. Systems with one degree of freedom, such as a mass on a spring, pendulums, balance wheels, and LC tuned circuits have one resonant frequency. Systems with two degrees of freedom, such as coupled pendulums and resonant transformers can have two resonant frequencies. A crystal lattice composed of &quot;N&quot; atoms bound together can have &quot;N&quot; resonant frequencies. As the number of coupled harmonic oscillators grows, the time it takes to transfer energy from one to the next becomes significant. The vibrations in them begin to travel through the coupled harmonic oscillators in waves, from one oscillator to the next.

The term &quot;resonator&quot; is most often used for a homogeneous object in which vibrations travel as waves, at an approximately constant velocity, bouncing back and forth between the sides of the resonator. The material of the resonator, through which the waves flow, can be viewed as being made of millions of coupled moving parts (such as atoms). Therefore, they can have millions of resonant frequencies, although only a few may be used in practical resonators. The oppositely moving waves interfere with each other, and at its resonant frequencies reinforce each other to create a pattern of standing waves in the resonator. If the distance between the sides is formula_1, the length of a round trip is formula_2. To cause resonance, the phase of a sinusoidal wave after a round trip must be equal to the initial phase so the waves self-reinforce. The condition for resonance in a resonator is that the round trip distance, formula_2, is equal to an integer number of wavelengths formula_4 of the wave:

:formula_5

If the velocity of a wave is formula_6, the frequency is formula_7 so the resonant frequencies are:

:formula_8

So the resonant frequencies of resonators, called normal modes, are equally spaced multiples (harmonics) of a lowest frequency called the fundamental frequency. The above analysis assumes the medium inside the resonator is homogeneous, so the waves travel at a constant speed, and that the shape of the resonator is rectilinear. If the resonator is inhomogeneous or has a nonrectilinear shape, like a circular drumhead or a cylindrical microwave cavity, the resonant frequencies may not occur at equally spaced multiples of the fundamental frequency. They are then called overtones instead of harmonics. There may be several such series of resonant frequencies in a single resonator, corresponding to different modes of vibration.

==Electromagnetics==
===Resonant circuits===
An electrical circuit composed of discrete components can act as a resonator when both an inductor and capacitor are included. Oscillations are limited by the inclusion of resistance, either via a specific resistor component, or due to resistance of the inductor windings. Such resonant circuits are also called RLC circuits after the circuit symbols for the components.

A distributed-parameter resonator has capacitance, inductance, and resistance that cannot be isolated into separate lumped capacitors, inductors, or resistors. An example of this, much used in filtering, is the helical resonator.

An inductor consisting of a coil of wire, is self-resonant at a certain frequency due to the parasitic capacitance between its turns. This is often an unwanted effect that can cause parasitic oscillations in RF circuits. The self-resonance of inductors is used in a few circuits, such as the Tesla coil.

===Cavity resonators===

A &quot;cavity resonator&quot; is a hollow closed conductor such as a metal box or a cavity within a metal block, containing electromagnetic waves (radio waves) reflecting back and forth between the cavity&#x27;s walls. When a source of radio waves at one of the cavity&#x27;s resonant frequencies is applied, the oppositely-moving waves form standing waves, and the cavity stores electromagnetic energy.

Since the cavity&#x27;s lowest resonant frequency, the fundamental frequency, is that at which the width of the cavity is equal to a half-wavelength (λ/2), cavity resonators are only used at microwave frequencies and above, where wavelengths are short enough that the cavity is conveniently small in size.

Due to the low resistance of their conductive walls, cavity resonators have very high Q factors; that is their bandwidth, the range of frequencies around the resonant frequency at which they will resonate, is very narrow. Thus they can act as narrow bandpass filters. Cavity resonators are widely used as the frequency determining element in microwave oscillators. Their resonant frequency can be tuned by moving one of the walls of the cavity in or out, changing its size.

====Cavity magnetron====

The cavity magnetron is a vacuum tube with a filament in the center of an evacuated, lobed, circular cavity resonator. A perpendicular magnetic field is imposed by a permanent magnet. The magnetic field causes the electrons, attracted to the (relatively) positive outer part of the chamber, to spiral outward in a circular path rather than moving directly to this anode. Spaced about the rim of the chamber are cylindrical cavities. The cavities are open along their length and so they connect with the common cavity space. As electrons sweep past these openings they induce a resonant high frequency radio field in the cavity, which in turn causes the electrons to bunch into groups. A portion of this field is extracted with a short antenna that is connected to a waveguide (a metal tube usually of rectangular cross section). The waveguide directs the extracted RF energy to the load, which may be a cooking chamber in a microwave oven or a high gain antenna in the case of radar.

====Klystron====

The klystron, tube waveguide, is a beam tube including at least two apertured cavity resonators. The beam of charged particles passes through the apertures of the resonators, often tunable wave reflection grids, in succession. A collector electrode is provided to intercept the beam after passing through the resonators. The first resonator causes bunching of the particles passing through it. The bunched particles travel in a field-free region where further bunching occurs, then the bunched particles enter the second resonator giving up their energy to excite it into oscillations. It is a particle accelerator that works in conjunction with a specifically tuned cavity by the configuration of the structures.

The reflex klystron is a klystron utilizing only a single apertured cavity resonator through which the beam of charged particles passes, first in one direction. A repeller electrode is provided to repel (or redirect) the beam after passage through the resonator back through the resonator in the other direction and in proper phase to reinforce the oscillations set up in the resonator.

====Application in particle accelerators====
On the beamline of an accelerator system, there are specific sections that are cavity resonators for radio frequency (RF) radiation. The (charged) particles that are to be accelerated pass through these cavities in such a way that the microwave electric field transfers energy to the particles, thus increasing their kinetic energy and thus accelerating them.
Several large accelerator facilities employ superconducting niobium cavities for improved performance compared to metallic (copper) cavities.

===Loop-gap resonator===

The loop-gap resonator (LGR) is made by cutting a narrow slit along the length of a conducting tube. The slit has an effective capacitance and the bore of the resonator has an effective inductance. Therefore, the LGR can be modeled as an RLC circuit and has a resonant frequency that is typically between 200 MHz and 2 GHz. In the absence of radiation losses, the effective resistance of the LGR is determined by the resistivity and electromagnetic skin depth of the conductor used to make the resonator.

One key advantage of the LGR is that, at its resonant frequency, its dimensions are small compared to the free-space wavelength of the electromagnetic fields. Therefore, it is possible to use LGRs to construct a compact and high-Q resonator that operates at relatively low frequencies where cavity resonators would be impractically large.

===Dielectric resonators===

If a piece of material with large dielectric constant is surrounded by a material with much lower dielectric constant, then this abrupt change in dielectric constant can cause confinement of an electromagnetic wave, which leads to a resonator that acts similarly to a cavity resonator.

===Transmission-line resonators===
Transmission lines are structures that allow broadband transmission of electromagnetic waves, e.g. at radio or microwave frequencies. Abrupt change of impedance (e.g. open or short) in a transmission line causes reflection of the transmitted signal. Two such reflectors on a transmission line evoke standing waves between them and thus act as a one-dimensional resonator, with the resonance frequencies determined by their distance and the effective dielectric constant of the transmission line. A common form is the resonant stub, a length of transmission line terminated in either a short circuit or open circuit, connected in series or parallel with a main transmission line. 

Planar transmission-line resonators are commonly employed for coplanar, stripline, and microstrip transmission lines. Such planar transmission-line resonators can be very compact in size and are widely used elements in microwave circuitry. In cryogenic solid-state research, superconducting transmission-line resonators contribute to solid-state spectroscopy and quantum information science.

===Optical cavities===
In a laser, light is amplified in a cavity resonator that is usually composed of two or more mirrors. Thus an &quot;optical cavity&quot;, also known as a resonator, is a cavity with walls that reflect electromagnetic waves (i.e. light). This allows standing wave modes to exist with little loss.

== Mechanical ==

Mechanical resonators are used in electronic circuits to generate signals of a precise frequency. For example, piezoelectric resonators, commonly made from quartz, are used as frequency references. Common designs consist of electrodes attached to a piece of quartz, in the shape of a rectangular plate for high frequency applications, or in the shape of a tuning fork for low frequency applications. The high dimensional stability and low temperature coefficient of quartz helps keeps resonant frequency constant. In addition, the quartz&#x27;s piezoelectric property converts the mechanical vibrations into an oscillating voltage, which is picked up by the attached electrodes. These crystal oscillators are used in quartz clocks and watches, to create the clock signal that runs computers, and to stabilize the output signal from radio transmitters.

Mechanical resonators can also be used to induce a standing wave in other media. For example, a multiple degree of freedom system can be created by imposing a base excitation on a cantilever beam. In this case the standing wave is imposed on the beam. This type of system can be used as a sensor to track changes in frequency or phase of the resonance of the fiber. One application is as a measurement device for dimensional metrology.

== Acoustic ==
The most familiar examples of acoustic resonators are in musical instruments. Every musical instrument has resonators. Some generate the sound directly, such as the wooden bars in a xylophone, the head of a drum, the strings in stringed instruments, and the pipes in an organ. Some modify the sound by enhancing particular frequencies, such as the sound box of a guitar or violin. Organ pipes, the bodies of woodwinds, and the sound boxes of stringed instruments are examples of acoustic cavity resonators.

===Automobiles===

The exhaust pipes in automobile exhaust systems are designed as acoustic resonators that work with the muffler to reduce noise, by making sound waves &quot;cancel each other out&quot;. The &quot;exhaust note&quot; is an important feature for some vehicle owners, so both the original manufacturers and the after-market suppliers use the resonator to enhance the sound. In &quot;tuned exhaust&quot; systems designed for performance, the resonance of the exhaust pipes can also be used to remove combustion products from the combustion chamber at a particular engine speed or range of speeds.

=== Percussion instruments ===

In many keyboard percussion instruments, below the centre of each note is a tube, which is an acoustic cavity resonator. The length of the tube varies according to the pitch of the note, with higher notes having shorter resonators. The tube is open at the top end and closed at the bottom end, creating a column of air that resonates when the note is struck. This adds depth and volume to the note. In string instruments, the body of the instrument is a resonator. The tremolo effect of a vibraphone is achieved via a mechanism that opens and shuts the resonators.

=== Stringed instruments ===

String instruments such as the bluegrass banjo may also have resonators. Many five-string banjos have removable resonators, so players can use the instrument with a resonator in bluegrass style, or without it in folk music style. The term &quot;resonator&quot;, used by itself, may also refer to the resonator guitar.

The modern ten-string guitar, invented by Narciso Yepes, adds four sympathetic string resonators to the traditional classical guitar. By tuning these resonators in a very specific way (C, B♭, A♭, G♭) and making use of their strongest partials (corresponding to the octaves and fifths of the strings&#x27; fundamental tones), the bass strings of the guitar now resonate equally with any of the 12 tones of the chromatic octave. The guitar resonator is a device for driving guitar string harmonics by an electromagnetic field. This resonance effect is caused by a feedback loop and is applied to drive the fundamental tones, octaves, 5th, 3rd to an infinite sustain.

<doc id="521511" wikidata="Q1165434" url="?curid=521511" title="The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex">
<text>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex is a book by English naturalist Charles Darwin, first published in 1871, which applies evolutionary theory to human evolution, and details his theory of sexual selection, a form of biological adaptation distinct from, yet interconnected with, natural selection. Darwin used the word &quot;descent&quot; to mean lineal descendant of ancestors. The book discusses many related issues, including evolutionary psychology, evolutionary ethics, evolutionary musicology, differences between human races, differences between sexes, the dominant role of women in mate choice, and the relevance of the evolutionary theory to society.

==Publication==
As Darwin wrote, he sent chapters to his daughter Henrietta for editing to ensure that damaging inferences could not be drawn, and also took advice from his wife Emma. The zoological illustrator T. W. Wood, (who had also illustrated Wallace&#x27;s &quot;The Malay Archipelago&quot; (1869)), drew many of the figures in this book. The corrected proofs were sent off on 15 January 1871 to the publisher John Murray and published on 24 February 1871 as two 450-page volumes, which Darwin insisted was one complete, coherent work, and were priced at £14 shillings.

Within three weeks of publication a reprint had been ordered, and 4,500 copies were in print by the end of March 1871, netting Darwin almost £1,500. Darwin&#x27;s name created demand for the book, but the ideas were old news. &quot;Everybody is talking about it without being shocked,&quot; which he found &quot;proof of the increasing liberality of England&quot;.

===Editions and reprints===
Darwin and some of his children edited many of the large number of revised editions, some extensively. In late 1873, Darwin tackled a new edition of the &quot;Descent of Man&quot;. Initially, he offered Wallace the work of assisting him, but, when Emma found out, she had the task given to their son George, so Darwin had to write apologetically to Wallace. Huxley assisted with an update on ape-brain inheritance, which Huxley thought &quot;pounds the enemy into a jelly... though none but anatomists&quot; would know it. The manuscript was completed in April 1874 and published on 13 November that year. This has been the edition most commonly reprinted after Darwin&#x27;s death and to the present day.

==Content==
===Part I: The evolution of man===

====Evolution of physical traits====
In the introduction to &quot;Descent&quot;, Darwin lays out the purpose of his text:
:&quot;The sole object of this work is to consider, firstly, whether man, like every other species, is descended from some pre-existing form; secondly, the manner of his development; and thirdly, the value of the differences between the so-called races of man.&quot;
Darwin&#x27;s approach to arguing for the evolution of human beings is to outline how similar human beings are to other animals. He begins by using anatomical similarities, focusing on body structure, embryology, and &quot;rudimentary organs&quot; that presumably were useful in one of man&#x27;s &quot;pre-existing&quot; forms. He then moves on to argue for the similarity of &quot;mental&quot; characteristics.

====Evolution of mental traits====

Based on the work of his cousin, Francis Galton, Darwin asserts that human character traits and mental characteristics are inherited in the same way as physical characteristics, and argues against the mind/body distinction for the purposes of evolutionary theory. From this Darwin then provides evidence for similar mental powers and characteristics in certain animals, focusing especially on apes, monkeys, and dogs for his analogies for love, cleverness, religion, kindness, and altruism. He concludes on this point that &quot;Nevertheless the difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind.&quot; He additionally turns to the behaviour of &quot;savages&quot; to show how many aspects of Victorian England&#x27;s society can be seen in more primitive forms.

In particular, Darwin argues that even moral and social instincts are evolved, comparing religion in man to fetishism in &quot;savages&quot; and his dog&#x27;s inability to tell whether a wind-blown parasol was alive or not. Darwin also argues that all civilisations had risen out of barbarism, and that he did not think that barbarism is a &quot;fall from grace&quot; as many commentators of his time had asserted.

====Natural selection and civilised society====

In this section of the book, Darwin also turns to the questions of what after his death would be known as social Darwinism and eugenics. Darwin notes that, as had been discussed by Alfred Russel Wallace and Galton, natural selection seemed to no longer act upon civilised communities in the way it did upon other animals:

Darwin felt that these urges towards helping the &quot;weak members&quot; was part of our evolved instinct of sympathy, and concluded that &quot;nor could we check our sympathy, even at the urging of hard reason, without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature&quot;. As such, &#x27;&quot;we must therefore bear the undoubtedly bad effects of the weak surviving and propagating their kind&quot;. Darwin did feel that the &quot;savage races&quot; of man would be subverted by the &quot;civilised races&quot; at some point in the near future, as stated in the human races section below. He did show a certain disdain for &quot;savages&quot;, professing that he felt more akin to certain altruistic tendencies in monkeys than he did to &quot;a savage who delights to torture his enemies&quot;. However, Darwin is not advocating genocide, but clinically predicting, by analogy to the ways that &quot;more fit&quot; varieties in a species displace other varieties, the likelihood that indigenous peoples will eventually die out from their contact with &quot;civilization&quot;, or become absorbed into it completely.

His political opinions (and Galton&#x27;s as well) were strongly inclined against the coercive, authoritarian forms of eugenics that became so prominent in the 20th century. Note that even Galton&#x27;s ideas about eugenics were not the compulsory sterilisation which became part of eugenics in the United States, or the later genocidal programs of Nazi Germany, but rather further education on the genetic aspects of reproduction, encouraging couples to make better choices for their wellbeing.

For each tendency of society to produce negative selections, Darwin also saw the possibility of society to itself check these problems, but also noted that with his theory &quot;progress is no invariable rule.&quot; Towards the end of &quot;Descent of Man&quot;, Darwin said that he believed man would &quot;sink into indolence&quot; if severe struggle was not continuous, and thought that &quot;there should be open competition for all men; and the most able should not be prevented by laws or customs from succeeding best and rearing the largest number of offspring&quot;, but also noted that he thought that the moral qualities of man were advanced much more by habit, reason, learning, and religion than by natural selection. The question plagued him until the end of his life, and he never concluded fully one way or the other about it.

====On the Races of Man====
In the first chapters of the book, Darwin argued that there is no fundamental gap between humans and other animals in intellectual and moral faculties as well as anatomy. Retreating from his egalitarian ideas of the 1830s, he ranked life on a hierarchic scale which he extended to human races on the basis of anthropology published since 1860: human prehistory outlined by John Lubbock and Edward Burnett Tylor combined archaeology and studies of modern indigenous peoples to show progressive evolution from Stone Age to steam age; the human mind as the same in all cultures but with modern &quot;primitive&quot; peoples giving insight into prehistoric ways of life. Darwin did not support their view that progress was inevitable, but he shared their belief in human unity and held the common attitude that male European liberalism and civilisation had progressed further in morality and intellect than &quot;savage&quot; peoples.

He attributed the &quot;great break in the organic chain between man and his nearest allies&quot; to extinction, and as spreading civilisation wiped out wildlife and native human cultures, the gap would widen to somewhere &quot;between man in a more civilised state, as we may hope, than the Caucasian, and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as at present between the negro or Australian and the gorilla.&quot; While there &quot;can be no doubt that the difference between the mind of the lowest man and that of the highest animal is immense&quot;, the &quot;difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, is certainly one of degree and not of kind.&quot; At the same time, all human races had many mental similarities, and early artefacts showing shared culture were evidence of evolution through common descent from an ancestral species which was likely to have been fully human.

Introducing Chapter 7 (&quot;On the Races of Man&quot;), Darwin wrote: &quot;It is not my intention here to describe the several so-called races of men; but to inquire what is the value of the differences between them under a classificatory point of view, and how they have originated.&quot; In answering the question of whether the races should rank as varieties of the same species or count as different species, Darwin discussed arguments which could support the idea that human races were distinct species. This included the geographical distribution of mammal groups which was correlated with the distribution of human races, and the finding of Henry Denny that different species of lice affected different races differently.
Darwin then presented the stronger evidence that human races are all the same species, noting that when races mixed together, they intercrossed beyond the &quot;usual test of specific distinctness&quot; and that characteristics identifying races were highly variable. He put great weight on the point that races graduate into each other, writing &quot;But the most weighty of all the arguments against treating the races of man as distinct species, is that they graduate into each other, independently in many cases, as far as we can judge, of their having intercrossed&quot;, and concluded that the stronger evidence was that they were not different species.

This conclusion on human unity was supported by monogenism, including John Bachman&#x27;s evidence that intercrossed human races were fully fertile. Proponents of polygenism opposed unity, but the gradual transition from one race to another confused them when they tried to decide how many human races should count as species: Louis Agassiz said eight, but Morton said twenty-two. Darwin commented that the &quot;question whether mankind consists of one or several species has of late years been much agitated by anthropologists, who are divided into two schools of monogenists and polygenists.&quot; The latter had to &quot;look at species either as separate creations or as in some manner distinct entities&quot; but those accepting evolution &quot;will feel no doubt that all the races of man are descended from a single primitive stock&quot;. Although races differed considerably, they also shared so many features &quot;that it is extremely improbable that they should have been independently acquired by aboriginally distinct species or races.&quot; He drew on his memories of Jemmy Button and John Edmonstone to emphasise &quot;the numerous points of mental similarity between the most distinct races of man. The American aborigines, Negroes and Europeans differ as much from each other in mind as any three races that can be named; yet I was incessantly struck, whilst living with the Fuegians on board the &quot;Beagle,&quot; with the many little traits of character, shewing how similar their minds were to ours; and so it was with a full-blooded negro with whom I happened once to be intimate.&quot; Darwin concluded that &quot;when the principles of evolution are generally accepted, as they surely will be before long, the dispute between the monogenists and the polygenists will die a silent and unobserved death.&quot;

Darwin rejected both the idea that races had been separately created, and also the concept that races had evolved in parallel from separate ancestral species of apes. He reviewed possible explanations of divergence into racial differences such as adaptations to different climates and habitats, but found inadequate evidence to support them, and proposed that the most likely cause was sexual selection, a subject to which he devoted the greater part of the book, as described in the following section.

===Part II and III: Sexual selection===
Part II of the book begins with a chapter outlining the basic principles of sexual selection, followed by a detailed review of many different taxa of the kingdom Animalia which surveys various classes such as molluscs and crustaceans. The tenth and eleventh chapters are both devoted to insects, the latter specifically focusing on the order Lepidoptera, the butterflies and moths. The remainder of the book shifts to the vertebrates, beginning with cold blooded vertebrates (fishes, amphibians and reptiles) followed by four chapters on birds. Two chapters on mammals precede those on humans. Darwin explained sexual selection as a combination of &quot;female choosiness&quot; and &quot;direct competition between males&quot;.
Darwin&#x27;s theories of evolution by natural selection were used to try to show women&#x27;s place in society was the result of nature. One of the first women to critique Darwin, Antoinette Brown Blackwell published &quot;The Sexes Throughout Nature&quot; in 1875. She was aware she would be considered presumptuous for criticising evolutionary theory but wrote that &quot;disadvantages under which we [women] are placed...will never be lessened by waiting&quot;. Blackwell&#x27;s book answered Darwin and Herbert Spencer, who she thought were the two most influential living men. She wrote of &quot;defrauded womanhood&quot; and her fears that &quot;the human race, forever retarding its own advancement...could not recognize and promote a genuine, broad, and healthful equilibrium of the sexes&quot;.

In the &quot;Descent of Man&quot;, Darwin wrote that by choosing tools and weapons over the years, &quot;man has ultimately become superior to woman&quot;, but Blackwell&#x27;s argument for women&#x27;s equality went largely ignored until the 1970s when feminist scientists and historians began to explore Darwin. As recently as 2004, Griet Vandermassen, aligned with other Darwinian feminists of the 1990s and early 2000s (decade), wrote that a unifying theory of human nature should include sexual selection. But then the &quot;opposite ongoing integration&quot; was promoted by another faction as an alternative in 2007. Nonetheless, Darwin&#x27;s explanation of sexual selection continues to receive support from both social and biological scientists as &quot;the best explanation to date&quot;.

====Apparently non-adaptive features====
In Darwin&#x27;s view, anything that could be expected to have some adaptive feature could be explained easily with his theory of natural selection. In &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, Darwin wrote that to use natural selection to explain something as complicated as a human eye, &quot;with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration&quot; might at first appear &quot;absurd in the highest possible degree,&quot; but nevertheless, if &quot;numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist&quot;, then it seemed quite possible to account for within his theory.

More difficult for Darwin were highly evolved and complicated features that conveyed apparently no adaptive advantage to the organism. Writing to colleague Asa Gray in 1860, Darwin commented that he remembered well a &quot;time when the thought of the eye made me cold all over, but I have got over this stage of the complaint, &amp; now small trifling particulars of structure often make me very uncomfortable. The sight of a feather in a peacock&#x27;s tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!&quot; Why should a bird like the peacock develop such an elaborate tail, which seemed at best to be a hindrance in its &quot;struggle for existence&quot;? To answer the question, Darwin had introduced in the &quot;Origin&quot; the theory of sexual selection, which outlined how different characteristics could be selected for if they conveyed a &quot;reproductive&quot; advantage to the individual. In this theory, male animals in particular showed heritable features acquired by sexual selection, such as &quot;weapons&quot; with which to fight over females with other males, or beautiful plumage with which to woo the female animals. Much of &quot;Descent&quot; is devoted to providing evidence for sexual selection in nature, which he also ties into the development of aesthetic instincts in human beings, as well as the differences in coloration between the human races.

Darwin had developed his ideas about sexual selection for this reason since at least the 1850s, and had originally intended to include a long section on the theory in his large, unpublished book on species. When it came to writing &quot;Origin&quot; (his &quot;abstract&quot; of the larger book), though, he did not feel he had sufficient space to engage in sexual selection to any strong degree, and included only three paragraphs devoted to the subject. Darwin considered sexual selection to be as much of a theoretical contribution of his as was his natural selection, and a substantial amount of &quot;Descent&quot; is devoted exclusively to this topic.

==Darwin&#x27;s background issues and concerns==
It was Darwin&#x27;s second book on evolutionary theory, following his 1859 work, &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, in which he explored the concept of natural selection and which had been met with a firestorm of controversy in reaction to Darwin&#x27;s theory. A single line in this first work hinted at such a conclusion: &quot;light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.&quot; When writing &quot;The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication&quot; in 1866, Darwin intended to include a chapter including humans in his theory, but the book became too big and he decided to write a separate &quot;short essay&quot; on ape ancestry, sexual selection and human expression, which became &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;.

The book is a response to various debates of Darwin&#x27;s time far more wide-ranging than the questions he raised in &quot;Origin&quot;. It is often erroneously assumed that the book was controversial because it was the first to outline the idea of human evolution and common descent. Coming out so late into that particular debate, while it was clearly Darwin&#x27;s intent to weigh in on this question, his goal was to approach it through a specific theoretical lens (sexual selection), which other commentators at the period had not discussed, and consider the evolution of morality and religion. The theory of sexual selection was also needed to counter the argument that beauty with no obvious utility, such as exotic birds&#x27; plumage, proved divine design, which had been put strongly by the Duke of Argyll in his book &quot;The Reign of Law&quot; (1868).

===Human faculties===
The major sticking point for many in the question of human evolution was whether human mental faculties could have possibly been evolved. The gap between humans and even the smartest ape seemed too large, even for those who were sympathetic to Darwin&#x27;s basic theory. Alfred Russel Wallace, the co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection, believed that the human mind was too complex to have evolved gradually, and began over time to subscribe to a theory of evolution that took more from spiritualism than it did the natural world. Darwin was deeply distressed by Wallace&#x27;s change of heart, and much of the &quot;Descent of Man&quot; is in response to opinions put forth by Wallace. Darwin focuses less on the question of whether humans evolved than he does on showing that each of the human faculties considered to be so far beyond those of beasts—such as moral reasoning, sympathy for others, beauty, and music—can be seen in kind (if not degree) in other animal species (usually apes and dogs).

===Human races===

Darwin was a long-time abolitionist who had been horrified by slavery when he first came into contact with it in Brazil while touring the world on the &quot;Beagle&quot; voyage many years before (slavery had been illegal in the British Empire since 1833). Darwin also was perplexed by the &quot;savage races&quot; he saw in South America at Tierra del Fuego, which he saw as evidence of man&#x27;s more primitive state of civilisation. During his years in London, his private notebooks were riddled with speculations and thoughts on the nature of the human races, many decades before he published &quot;Origin&quot; and &quot;Descent&quot;.

When making his case that human races were all closely related and that the apparent gap between humans and other animals was due to closely related forms being extinct, Darwin drew on his experiences on the voyage showing that &quot;savages&quot; were being wiped out by &quot;civilized&quot; peoples.
When Darwin referred to &quot;civilised races&quot; he was almost always describing European cultures, and apparently drew no clear distinction between biological races and cultural races in humans. Few made that distinction at the time, an exception being Alfred Russel Wallace.

===Social implications of Darwinism===
Since the publication of &quot;Origin&quot;, a wide variety of opinions had been put forward on whether the theory had implications towards human society. One of these, later known as Social Darwinism, has been attributed to Herbert Spencer&#x27;s writings before publication of &quot;Origin&quot;, and argued that society would naturally sort itself out, and that the more &quot;fit&quot; individuals would rise to positions of higher prominence, while the less &quot;fit&quot; would succumb to poverty and disease. On this interpretation, Spencer alleged that government-run social programmes and charity hinder the &quot;natural&quot; stratification of the populace. But while Spencer did first introduce the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; in 1864, he always vigorously denied this interpretation of his works, arguing that the natural course of social evolution is toward greater altruism, and that the good done by charity and giving aid to the less fortunate, so long as done without coercion and in such a way as to foster independence rather than dependence, outweighs any harm done by saving the less fit. In any case, Spencer was primarily a Lamarckian evolutionist; hence, fitness could be acquired in a single generation and thus in no way did &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; as a tenet of Darwinian evolution predate it.

Another of these interpretations, later known as eugenics, was put forth by Darwin&#x27;s cousin, Francis Galton, in 1865 and 1869. Galton argued that just as physical traits were clearly inherited among generations of people, so could be said for mental qualities (genius and talent). Galton argued that social mores needed to change so that heredity was a conscious decision, to avoid over-breeding by &quot;less fit&quot; members of society and the under-breeding of the &quot;more fit&quot; ones. In Galton&#x27;s view, social institutions such as welfare and insane asylums were allowing &quot;inferior&quot; humans to survive and reproduce at levels faster than the more &quot;superior&quot; humans in respectable society, and if corrections were not soon taken, society would be awash with &quot;inferiors.&quot; Darwin read his cousin&#x27;s work with interest, and devoted sections of &quot;Descent of Man&quot; to discussion of Galton&#x27;s theories. Neither Galton nor Darwin, though, advocated any eugenic policies such as those undertaken in the early 20th century, as government coercion of any form was very much against their political opinions.

==Sexual selection==
Darwin&#x27;s views on sexual selection were opposed strongly by his co-discoverer of natural selection, Alfred Russel Wallace, though much of his &quot;debate&quot; with Darwin took place after Darwin&#x27;s death. Wallace argued against sexual selection, saying that the male-male competition aspects were simply forms of natural selection, and that the notion of female mate choice was attributing the ability to judge standards of beauty to animals far too cognitively undeveloped to be capable of aesthetic feeling (such as beetles).

Wallace also argued that Darwin too much favoured the bright colours of the male peacock as adaptive without realising that the &quot;drab&quot; peahen&#x27;s coloration is itself adaptive, as camouflage. Wallace more speculatively argued that the bright colours and long tails of the peacock were &quot;not&quot; adaptive in any way, and that bright coloration could result from non-adaptive physiological development (for example, the internal organs of animals, not being subject to a visual form of natural selection, come in a wide variety of bright colours). This has been questioned by later scholars as quite a stretch for Wallace, who in this particular instance abandoned his normally strict &quot;adaptationist&quot; agenda in asserting that the highly intricate and developed forms such as a peacock&#x27;s tail resulted by sheer &quot;physiological processes&quot; that were somehow not at all subjected to adaptation.

Apart from Wallace, a number of scholars considered the role of sexual selection in human evolution controversial. Darwin was accused of looking at the evolution of early human ancestors through the moral lens of the 19th century Victorian society. Joan Roughgarden, citing many elements of sexual behaviour in animals and humans that cannot be explained by the sexual selection model, suggested that the function of sex in human evolution was primarily social. Joseph Jordania suggested that in explaining such human morphological and behavioural characteristics as singing, dancing, body painting, wearing of clothes, Darwin (and proponents of sexual selection) neglected another important evolutionary force, intimidation of predators and competitors with the ritualised forms of warning display. Warning display uses virtually the same arsenal of visual, audio, olfactory and behavioural features as sexual selection. According to the principle of aposematism (warning display), to avoid costly physical violence and to replace violence with the ritualised forms of display, many animal species (including humans) use different forms of warning display: visual signals (contrastive body colours, eyespots, body ornaments, threat display and various postures to look bigger), audio signals (ing, growling, group vocalisations, drumming on external objects), olfactory signals (producing strong body odors, particularly when excited or scared), behavioural signals (demonstratively slow walking, aggregation in large groups, aggressive display behaviour against predators and conspecific competitors). According to Jordania, most of these warning displays were incorrectly attributed to the forces of sexual selection.

While debates on the subject continued, in January 1871 Darwin started on another book, using leftover material on emotional expressions, which became &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot;.

In recent years controversy also involved the peacock tail, the most famous symbol of the principle of sexual selection. A seven-year Japanese study of free-ranging peafowl came to the conclusion that female peafowl do not select mates merely on the basis of their trains. Mariko Takahashi found no evidence that peahens expressed any preference for peacocks with more elaborate trains, such as trains having more ocelli, a more symmetrical arrangement or a greater length. Takahashi determined that the peacock&#x27;s train was not the universal target of female mate choice, showed little variance across male populations, and, based on physiological data collected from this group of peafowl, do not correlate to male physical conditions. Adeline Loyau and her colleagues responded to Takahashi&#x27;s study by voicing concern that alternative explanations for these results had been overlooked and that these might be essential for the understanding of the complexity of mate choice. They concluded that female choice might indeed vary in different ecological conditions. Jordania suggested that peacock&#x27;s display of colourful and oversize train with plenty of eyespots, together with their extremely loud call and fearless behaviour has been formed by the forces of natural selection (not sexual selection), and served as a warning (aposematic) display to intimidate predators and rivals.

===Effect on society===
In January 1871, Thomas Huxley&#x27;s former disciple, the anatomist St. George Mivart, had published &quot;On the Genesis of Species&quot; as a critique of natural selection. In an anonymous &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; article, he claimed that the &quot;Descent of Man&quot; would unsettle &quot;our half educated classes&quot; and talked of people doing as they pleased, breaking laws and customs. An infuriated Darwin guessed that Mivart was the author and, thinking &quot;I shall soon be viewed as the most despicable of men&quot;, looked for an ally. In September, Huxley wrote a cutting review of Mivart&#x27;s book and article and a relieved Darwin told him &quot;How you do smash Mivart&#x27;s theology... He may write his worst &amp; he will never mortify me again&quot;. As 1872 began, Mivart politely inflamed the argument again, writing &quot;wishing you very sincerely a happy new year&quot; while wanting a disclaimer of the &quot;fundamental intellectual errors&quot; in the &quot;Descent of Man&quot;. This time, Darwin ended the correspondence.

<text>Michael Andrews (born November 17, 1967), also known as Elgin Park, is an American multi-instrumental musician, producer, and film score composer. He is best known for a cover version of the Tears for Fears song &quot;Mad World&quot;, which he recorded with Gary Jules for the &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; soundtrack, and which became the 2003 UK Christmas number one. He is a founding member of the San Diego soul-jazz band The Greyboy Allstars, where he goes by the moniker Elgin Park.

==Soundtrack Composing + Production==
After joining The Greyboy Allstars following the dissolution of his band The Origin, Andrews fell into film score composition by chance in 1998 when The Greyboy Allstars were asked to score Jake Kasdan&#x27;s first feature &quot;Zero Effect&quot; and worked on the music for the highly regarded (though short-lived) TV series, &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;. In 2000, Richard Kelly commissioned him to do the soundtrack for the film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;. Its original score album went on to sell over 100,000 copies (in part because of Andrews&#x27;s remake of Tears for Fears&#x27; &quot;Mad World&quot;, featuring Gary Jules), and Andrews became a composer to watch. He has since gone on to compose scores for the movies &quot;Out Cold&quot;, &quot;Nothing&quot;, &quot;Cypher&quot;, &quot;Orange County&quot;, &quot;My Suicidal Sweetheart&quot;, &quot;Me and You and Everyone We Know&quot;, &quot;The TV Set&quot;, a segment of &quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot;, &quot;Unaccompanied Minors&quot;, &quot;Bridesmaids&quot;, &quot;Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story&quot; and Daddy&#x27;s Home among others.

===&quot;Donnie Darko&quot;===
In early 2000, Jim Juvonen gave Andrews a copy of the script for the as-yet-unmade feature film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;. Director Richard Kelly knew Andrews worked with The Greyboy Allstars, and made music under the name Elgin Park.

Like his role models John Barry and Ennio Morricone, Andrews wanted a song on his otherwise instrumental score. He chose &quot;Mad World&quot; by Tears for Fears (originally released in 1982), which his childhood friend Gary Jules sang as Andrews played piano.

The first soundtrack record was released by Andy Factor, a friend of Andrews, through his Everloving Records label in 2002. As &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; was not a hit at first, there was little interest in the soundtrack in the US. The film was more popular in Europe, especially in the UK, where it outgrossed the US release.

This sparked interest in the soundtrack and &quot;Mad World&quot;, which was a 2003 Christmas #1 on the UK Singles Chart. It reached the top 30 of the American &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock chart in 2004 and hit No. 1 on the Canadian Digital Singles chart in January 2007. It charted in countries like Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Australia in 2003 and 2004, and a snippet was used in the television commercial for the 2006 Xbox 360 video game &quot;Gears of War&quot;.

===&quot;Me and You and Everyone We Know&quot;===
In 2005, Andrews scored &quot;Me and You and Everyone We Know&quot;, a film by Miranda July praised at both Sundance and Cannes film festivals. The score to the film was released on Everloving Records on July 12, 2005.

Initially taking cues from the characters&#x27; dialogue, Andrews began writing the score. He came to understand the film&#x27;s world as a kind of alternate reality where people believe in fate and chance—and this was the world he needed to paint with his music. He also saw the feelings July was trying to get across in her film as very primary. &quot;She tries to break things down to very basic, simple shapes—the simplest shapes possible, and that totally influenced me in my music&quot;.

Working out of his custom-built backyard studio in Glendale, California, Andrews spent three months creating the score using an orchestra of obscure vintage synthesizers (a miniature hotwired Casio keyboard was unearthed at a garage sale for $10) and drum machines. His concept was to play what he termed amateurish, emotional, naïve, magical and simple music on highly unemotional, inorganic instruments—for example, a calculator with built-in twelve-note keyboard that lends a haunting portamento melody to one of the film&#x27;s motifs.

Other instruments used in the score include Andrews&#x27;s modified piano (rather than hitting the strings directly, the hammers first make contact with a piece of soft felt, creating a warmer, slightly muffled tone), as well as his Moog and Vocoder synthesizers. Despite all the electronic gear, no MIDI was used in the recording, so that all the humanness, all the subtle variations of rhythm, are intact. Inara George adds vocals in several climactic moments throughout the film. In some cases, cues were composed of only two or three tracks in order to attain the magical simplicity for which the film called out.

==Solo career==
Andrews released his first solo album, &quot;Hand on String&quot;, on his own newly established label, Elgin Park Recordings, in summer 2006. He is credited on the album as Mike Andrews.

In August 2012, Andrews&#x27;s second solo record, &quot;Spilling A Rainbow&quot;, was released on Everloving Records performed mostly alone, and with Dan Long and Steve Kaye recording.

<doc id="521520" wikidata="Q801289" url="?curid=521520" title="Ochanomizu Station">
<text>is a railway station in Tokyo, Japan, operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) and Tokyo subway operator Tokyo Metro. The station straddles the boundary between the Chiyoda and Bunkyō special wards; the JR station is in the former while the Tokyo Metro station is in the latter.

==Lines==
Ochanomizu Station is serviced by the following lines:
**Chūō Main Line (including Chūō Line and Chūō-Sōbu Line)
**Sōbu Main Line (including Chūō-Sōbu Line)
**

Passengers can also transfer to nearby Shin-ochanomizu Station on the Tokyo Metro Chiyoda Line.

==Location==
JR East&#x27;s Ochanomizu station lies south of the Kanda River in Chiyoda ward. During the Edo period, the Kanda River was rerouted to pass through Ochanomizu, which was otherwise a highland between two valleys. Hijiribashi (聖橋, Hijiri Bridge) crosses over the river near a station exit. The subway Marunouchi Line makes a short above-ground appearance as it passes over the river. Holy Resurrection Cathedral (Nicholai-dō) is easily accessible from the Hijiribashi Exit of this station. The Ochanomizu neighborhood is known for its many guitar and instrument shops.

The Tokyo Metro station is located in Bunkyō Ward, separate from the JR East station, and is served by the Marunouchi Line. The area is also served by the at , which is connected to on the .

==JR East==

The JR East portion of the station has two island platforms serving four tracks, forming a Cross-platform interchange. Tracks 1 and 4 (the outer tracks) serve trains on the Chūō Line whilst tracks 2 and 3 are used by trains on the Chūō-Sōbu Line.

===Platforms===


There are two exits from Ochanomizu to street level. The larger of the two is the Ochanomizu-bashi exit on the western end of the station which features ticket vending machines, a JR reservation office, toilets, and lockers. The other is the Hijiri-bashi exit which only has ticket vending machines and toilets.

==Tokyo Metro==

The Tokyo Metro station consists of two side platforms serving two tracks.

===Platforms===

==History==
The JR East station opened on 31 December 1904. The Tokyo Metro station opened on 20 January 1954.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2013, the JR East station was used by 104,737 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the 34th-busiest station operated by JR East. In fiscal 2013, the Tokyo Metro station was used by an average of 55,529 passengers per day (exiting and entering passengers), making it the 66th-busiest station operated by Tokyo Metro. The average daily passenger figures for each operator in previous years are as shown below.

<doc id="521529" wikidata="Q62357" url="?curid=521529" title="Erwin Stresemann">
<text>Erwin Friedrich Theodor Stresemann (22 November 1889, in Dresden – 20 November 1972, in East Berlin) was a German naturalist and ornithologist. Stresemann was an ornithologist of extensive breadth who compiled one of the first and most comprehensive accounts of avian biology of its time as part of the &quot;Handbuch der Zoologie&quot; (Handbook of Zoology). In the process of his studies on birds, he also produced one of the most extensive historical accounts on the development of the science of ornithology. He influenced numerous ornithologists around him and oversaw the development of ornithology in Germany as editor of the &quot;Journal für Ornithologie&quot;. He also took an interest in poetry, philosophy and linguistics. He published a monograph on the Paulohi language based on studies made during his ornithological expedition to the Indonesian island.

==Early life==
Stresemann was born in Dresden to Richard, an apothecary and Marie. His grandfather Theodor owned the &quot;Zum Roten Adler&quot; pharmacy in Berlin-Kölln while his father and a brother Gustav owned the &quot;Mohrenapotheke&quot; in Dresden from 1876. The family was affluent, providing a stimulating environment and he took an interest in beetles and maintained a vivarium. When he joined the Vitzthum Gymnasium, the teacher of mathematics and biology, Dr. Otto Koepert, gave Erwin the job of organizing the school&#x27;s collection of American and African birds. At a comparatively young age he was able to travel to Heligoland, Bornholm and Moscow. After high school he went to study zoology at the University of Jena in 1908, and then transferred to the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich to study under Richard von Hertwig, and still later at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology. He made contact with Ernst Haeckel and studied marine biology at Bergen. He took a break from 1910 to 1912 to join as an ornithologist the &quot;Second Freiburg Expedition&quot; to the Moluccas (1910–12). The expedition was led by Karl Deninger, a geologist who had visited the islands in 1906–1907. They were joined by ethnologist Odo Deodatus Tauern. The cost had to be borne by the participants, and Stresemann prepared himself on fauna, geology and ethnology of the Moluccas. He went to Tring and consulted with Ernst Hartert and then climbed hills and trained to stand the heat by climbing Mount Vesuvius. The three had a custom built boat but it did not arrive in the Mollucas when they reached Singapore by a Lloyd Steamer in September 1910. They interacted with the Sekai through the Italian explorer G. Emilio Cerruti who had lived there for two decades (as the king of the tribe!). Their boat &quot;Friborg&quot; arrived in November but the boat did not do well and they were stranded in Bali. Repair of the boat in Java would take three weeks with Deninger handling it while Stresemann and Tauern crossed Bali examining the fauna (adding 53 new species of birds from Bali). The &quot;Friborg&quot; sank while Deninger was returning to Bali and subsequently all journey were made on a Dutch steamer. They travelled into central Seram and during this time Stresemann took a great deal of interest in the native Alfurians. He spent six months studying the language and exploring Buru. They finally returned to Europe on 1 April 1912 with 1,200 bird skins. Stresemann then studied the bird collections at the Rothschild Museum in Tring where Ernst Hartert worked. His study was supported by Rothschild, and several new species were named in his honour. Stresemann also published his studies on the now near-extinct &quot;Paulohi&quot; language and wrote a monograph on the topic and a paper on language relations. He also published on the religious customs on Seran. Stresemann also took an interest in poetry, the writings of Goethe, Descartes and Bismarck. Stresemann&#x27;s studies were interrupted by the First World War and he was conscripted, serving initially in an artillery unit on the Western Front. From an anchored balloon used to study the accuracy of artillery, he made studies using rangefinders on the heights of flight of swifts. He was transferred to Italy and was wounded in November 1917. He returned to Munich and resumed his studies and graduated with majors in zoology and minors in botany and anthropology. He briefly studied under Richard von Hertwig in Munich and examined the avifauna of Macedonia. He graduated summa cum laude in March 1920.

==&quot;Aves&quot;==

One of Stresemann&#x27;s early achievements was his authorship of the parts on &quot;Aves&quot; in the &quot;Handbuch der Zoologie&quot;. In 1914, the editor of the series, Willy Kükenthal (1861–1922), offered the task to him after others like Anton Reichenow (1847–1941), Valentin Haecker (1864–1927) and Oskar Heinroth (1871–1945) refused to take it up as they were preoccupied. His position as a 24-year old zoology student in comparison to the others was remarkable and Jurgen Haffer notes that this work acted as a springboard for his future career. Stresemann had eminent peers and mentors in Ernst Hartert, Carl Zimmer, Otto Kleinschmidt and Carl Eduard Hellmayr. The &quot;Aves&quot; work continued to be updated until 1934 and Stresemann produced one of the most comprehensive treatises on birds. It covered anatomy, morphology, behaviour, physiology, and evolution in ways that no other work had done before. It was not until the 1960s that anything comparable was produced in the English language in the multi-author work edited by A.J. Marshall (1960–1961) and later in the multi-volume series on &quot;Avian Biology&quot; edited by Farner and King.

==Berlin==

In 1920 he succeeded Anton Reichenow (in his seventies) as curator of ornithology at the Zoological Museum in Berlin, a position he stayed in until his retirement in 1961. The surprise appointment was through Kükenthal&#x27;s influence. He attended meetings of the Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft where he was known for his argumentation. He proved himself as a person of wide reading and immense knowledge. His first student was Bernard Rensch. This was followed by Theodor Elsässer who studied iridescent feathers for his doctorate. This was followed by Ernst Mayr on zoogeography, Ernst Schüz on the evolution of powder down, Wilhelm Meise on systematics, Emil Kattinger and Fritz Frank. They pursued diverse topics in ornithology. He was made professor in 1930 and from 1946 to 1961 he was tenured professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin. In November 1935, Stresemann was invited to Yale University by Leonard Cutler Sanford and was offered a position there. Stresemann however felt that he belonged to Berlin. He wrote that he could have worked there but could not live there. During the war years from 1941, he ensured that the 40,000 bird skins and rare books were safely stored in an underground locker. They were safely restored after the war. He also kept up communication with European ornithologists who became German prisoners of war such as David Bannerman. He ensured that they obtained the latest research papers as well. During his career, he worked continuously on several areas of ornithology and maintained a broad interest that allowed him to produce a major treatise on the history and development of the field of ornithology. Towards the 1960s he recognized his own weaknesses in not understanding the applications of statistics in ornithology or the biochemical approaches to systematics. At this point, he shifted focus, along with his second wife Vesta, to the study of the patterns of moults in birds. The Frank M. Chapman Memorial Fund allowed him to examine bird collections around the world to study moult. In his 1966 work dedicated to Oskar Heinroth, he examined moulting patterns and sought to see if there were phylogenetic patterns in them and concluded that they did not show any clear relationship. He found several other biological traits that seemed to influence moult, at least of the flight feathers. He was decorated with GDR Patriotic Order of Merit. In the 1960s and 70s he and his wife were provided special permissions to pass through the Berlin wall at any time to visit the Zoological Museum.

When the Natural History Museum in London established their ornithology collections at Tring in July 1972, Stresemann and his wife were special invitees at the inauguration.

==Influences==

Stresemann was one of the outstanding ornithologists of the 20th century but is often not recognized outside Germany because most of his works were written in German and ignored due to the wartime rivalries. At the age of 40, Stresemann was elected President of the 8th International Congress. He encouraged a number of young German scientists, including his most famous student Ernst Mayr and Bernhard Rensch. Stresemann had proposed that geographic isolation was key to the speciation of birds, an idea which was developed further by Mayr. Stresemann&#x27;s influence in ornithology was through his work &quot;Aves&quot;, the editorship of the &quot;Journal für Ornithologie&quot;, the leadership of the DO-G and through mentoring students. He established what has been called the &quot;New Avian Biology.&quot; Mayr however noted that despite being progressive, Stresemann did not fully grasp or understand the synthesis of evolution and genetics.

Stresemann was the long-standing editor of the &quot;Journal für Ornithologie&quot; (1922 onwards). As editor, he moved away from the traditional emphasis on faunistics and collections to a preference for articles dealing with the anatomy, physiology, life-history studies and the behaviour of birds. His major publication was the volume &quot;Aves&quot; (1927–1934) in the &quot;Handbuch der Zoologie&quot; (Handbook of Zoology). He also wrote &quot;Entwicklung der Ornithologie von Aristoteles bis zur Gegenwart&quot; (1951), a review of the development of ornithology from Aristotle to modern times, translated into English in 1975 as &quot;Ornithology from Aristotle to the Present&quot;.

==Personal life==
Stresemann married Elisabeth Deninger, sister of his expedition-mate Karl Deninger, in 1916. She was the daughter of chemist Albert Deninger, known for his work on fluoride toothpastes. They divorced in 1939. Stresemann married Vesta née Grote (who was widowed after her husband Friedrich Hauchecorne (1894 – 1938), director of the Halle zoo, was killed in a hunting accident) during the war years in 1941 and they worked on many ornithological papers, especially on moult, and she survived him to live to 103 years. Stresemann was known for his impeccable sense of dressing, his affable personality and excellent dancing in his youth. He was an excellent speaker, carefully adding wit and humour, and proud of the German language despite knowing excellent English. At the Ornithological Congress at Oxford in 1934 he intentionally gave a one-hour presidential speech in German. His German pride was always tempered by his meticulousness and when surprise was expressed after turkey frescoes were found in the Schleswig Cathedral during restoration Stresemann carefully examined the evidence to see if indeed the pictures were made in the 13th century. It however turned out that the frescoes were added by Hanover artist August Olbers who confessed adding them when restoring damage in 1890.

Stresemann died after suffering from poor health since his 80th birthday. In February 1972 he had a cataract removal for his eyes and was delighted with his new found vision. He however suffered that autumn with a heart-trouble and he had wished to be buried alongside his mentor Ernst Hartert. He was cremated and according to his wishes the ashes were interred into the grave of Ernst Hartert in the Waldfriedhof (forest cemetery) at Dahlem.

==Legacy==
Stresemann is commemorated in the scientific names of numerous species of animals including a species of gecko, &quot;Cyrtodactylus stresemanni&quot;, at least two butterflies (Walter Rothschild named some butterflies from the Mollucca expedition after Stresemann. One of them, &quot;Papilio stresemanni&quot;, was mistaken by the German press who thought it linked Gustav Stresemann, then foreign minister, with the Jewish banking magnate), a grasshopper &quot;Oxya stresemanni&quot; and several birds (&quot;Hylexetastes stresemanni&quot; described by Emilie Snethlage in 1925 and &quot;Zaratornis stresemanni&quot; are full species but a much larger number of birds honour him in their subspecific name), a bat &quot;Rousettus stresemanni&quot;, and a mollusc &quot;Isidora stresemanni&quot;. Some of these species were described from Stresemann&#x27;s Molluccas expedition.

==Nazi affiliation==

Stresemann&#x27;s association with and affinity for Nazi ideology is ambiguous. There is no evidence that he was a member of the NSDAP; however, when Stresemann visited the bird collection at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia in January 1936, he was questioned by a newspaper reporter about Hitler’s imperialist agenda and its vision of Aryan supremacy. Stresemann reportedly stated that “There is a pure Aryan race politically—if not anthropologically ... The Hitler Government preaches the idea of the emergence of a race of tall, fair, blue-eyed men and women which we shall believe to be superior, racially, economically and artistically ... I do not believe Germany can be great if the German strain is mixed with the blood of alien races.”

Stresemann also stated, in response to a question about the anti-Jewish Nuremberg Laws in Germany that, &quot;the Government is trying to work out a plan—a solution. I believe in time it will be found”, presumably referring to the Final Solution. Stresemann however supported British prisoners of war including John Buxton, Peter Conder, and George Waterston in Nazi Germany who were interested in birds, providing them books and supporting their bird studies.

<text>Temple blocks are a type of percussion instrument consisting of a set of woodblocks. It is descended from the muyu, an instrument originating from eastern Asia, where it is commonly used in religious ceremonies.

==Description==
It is a carved hollow wooden instrument with a large slit. In its traditional form, the muyu, the shape is somewhat bulbous like a bell, but modern instruments are often rectangular in shape. They are generally played in sets of four or more to give a variety of pitches, in which they are also known as &quot;tone blocks&quot;. In Western music, they can be traced back to early jazz drummers where they were used as exotic instruments before being later adopted into widespread orchestral use. An updated version of the instrument made by Latin Percussion, known as &quot;granite blocks&quot;, is made out of plastic rather than wood.

The sound of temple blocks is similar to that of normal woodblocks, although temple blocks have a darker, more &quot;hollow&quot; timbre. In their most common configuration of five, temple blocks are typically tuned to a pentatonic scale. Chromatic and diatonic sets have also been made. Despite this, they are not commonly treated as pitched percussion.

Temple blocks are often used as sound effects, such as in Leroy Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Syncopated Clock&quot; and &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; where they mimic a ticking clock and a galloping horse, respectively. They can also be used to reinforce the melody. John Barnes Chance&#x27;s &quot;Incantation and Dance&quot; and &quot;Variations on a Korean Folk Song&quot; both have temple blocks introduce and double the motifs that appear within the music, with the latter using the pentatonic nature of the temple blocks to evoke the sound of the Orient.

<text>South Africa is the southernmost country in Africa. It is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 60 million people, is the world&#x27;s 24th-most populous nation.

The World Bank classifies South Africa as an upper-middle-income economy, and a newly industrialised country. Its economy is the largest in Africa, and the 34th-largest in the world. In terms of purchasing power parity, South Africa has the seventh-highest per capita income in Africa. However, poverty and inequality remain widespread, with about a quarter of the population unemployed and living on less than US$1.25 a day. Nevertheless, South Africa has been identified as a middle power in international affairs, and maintains significant regional influence.

<text>In art history, the French term objet d&#x27;art (; ) describes an ornamental work of art, and the term objets d’art describes a range of works of art, usually small and three-dimensional, made of high-quality materials, and a finely-rendered finish that emphasises the aesthetics of the artefact. Artists create and produce &quot;objets d’art&quot; in the fields of the decorative arts and metalwork, porcelain and vitreous enamel; figurines, plaquettes, and engraved gems; ivory carvings and semi-precious hardstone carvings; tapestries, antiques, and antiquities; and books with fine bookbinding.

The National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London, describes their accumulated artworks as a: &quot;collection of &quot;objets d’art&quot; [which] comprises over 800 objects. These are mostly small, decorative art items that fall outside the scope of the Museum’s ceramic, plate, textiles and glass collections.&quot; The artwork collection also includes metal curtain ties, a lacquered &quot;papier-maché&quot; tray, tobacco boxes, cigarette cases, &quot;découpage&quot; (cut-paper items), portrait miniatures, a gilt-brass clock finial, plaques, statuettes, plaquettes, a horse brass, a metal pipe tamper, a small glass painting, et cetera.

==Objet de vertu==

The &quot;objet de vertu&quot;, wherein &quot;vertu&quot; suggests rich materials and a higher standard of refined manufacture and finish; the classification usually excludes objects made for realising a practical function. As works of art, &quot;objets de vertu&quot; reflect the rarified aesthetic and conspicuous consumption characteristic of an aristocratic court—of the late-medieval Burgundian dukes, the Mughal emperors, or Ming China—such as the Lycurgus Cup, which is a cage cup made of Roman glass; the Byzantine agate &quot;Rubens vase&quot;; the Roman glass &quot;Portland Vase&quot;, and onyx and chalcedony cameo carvings, whilst the pre–World War I production of &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot; featured Fabergé eggs made of precious metals and decorated with gemstones.

A comparable term that appears in 18th- and 19th-century French sale catalogs, though now less used, is objets de curiosité, &quot;objects of curiosity&quot;, now devolved into the less-valued &quot;curio&quot;. Elaborate late Renaissance display pieces in silver that incorporate organic elements such as ostrich eggs, nuts of the coco de mer and sea-shells are grouped in a volume, published in 1991, as &quot;The Curiousities&quot; in the catalogues of the Waddesdon Bequest at the British Museum.

<text>Richard and Judy is a term used to refer to British television presenters Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan, who are married. They co-hosted the ITV programme &quot;This Morning&quot; from 1988 to 2001 and later presented the chat show &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot; from 2001 to 2009.

==Marriage and family==
Madeley and Finnigan met in 1982 while working on separate television programmes for Granada Television. Both were married to other people at the time. After divorcing their previous spouses, they began a relationship and married in 1986 in Manchester. The couple had two children together: Jack Christopher (born 1986) and Chloe Susannah (born 1987), both born in Manchester.

==&quot;This Morning&quot;==

They presented &quot;This Morning&quot; from its launch in 1988 until 2001. The programme featured a range of segments, including celebrity interviews, household tips, cookery, and phone-ins, and typically aired for around two hours each weekday morning on ITV. Initially broadcast from the Albert Dock in Liverpool, production moved to London in 1996. 

Since leaving, Madeley has appeared on &quot;This Morning&quot; solo to promote his autobiography. On 5 October 2009, he and his co-presenter joined the show&#x27;s then-current hosts, Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, to celebrate its 21st anniversary. The couple also returned for a special one-off episode to mark the programme&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

==&quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot;==
In 2001, they left &quot;This Morning&quot; after being approached by Channel 4 to host a programme titled &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot;, which aired for one hour in the teatime slot.

The show was produced by Cactus TV, a company run by Simon Ross, the brother of Jonathan Ross, and his wife Amanda Ross. In February 2007, the couple issued a public apology on air following the discovery of a phone scam related to the daily quiz You Say We Pay, in which winners were selected in advance while viewers were still encouraged to call the premium-rate entry number. On the same broadcast, Madeley and Finnigan announced that the quiz would be suspended until further notice. Later that week, it was reported that police investigations would be conducted, potentially leading to interviews with the hosts. Channel 4 stated that the scam might have occurred over two series of the show. Both hosts denied involvement in the scam, which was exposed by &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; after receiving the story from media publicist Jonathan Hartley.

The show introduced two clubs: the Richard &amp; Judy Book Club and the Richard &amp; Judy Wine Club, which were similar in format to those associated with Oprah Winfrey. The Book Club focused on literature by new and emerging authors, with one book reviewed each week. An awards ceremony was held annually to announce the book selected as &quot;Read of the Year.&quot;

In July 2008, Finnigan underwent knee surgery and took a brief leave of absence from the show to recover. During this period, Madeley was joined by guest presenters Emma Bunton and Myleene Klass, and presented one edition of the show alone on 23 July 2008.

In 2008, it was announced that their Channel 4 series which began in June would be the last for the programme, and ended on 22 August 2008. However, they signed a contract for a new prime-time show on UKTV&#x27;s new channel, Watch. Their new show still contained features such as the &quot;Book Club&quot; and &quot;Summer Read.&quot;

===Move to Watch===
Richard and Judy began hosting a new topical chat show on UKTV&#x27;s digital channel, Watch, after seven years at Channel 4. The programme, &quot;Richard and Judy&#x27;s New Position&quot;, premiered on 7 October 2008 and aired weeknights at 8:00 PM. The first episode was viewed by 200,000 people, but viewership declined over time, with the second episode attracting 53,000 viewers and numbers eventually falling to 11,000. This contrasted with their previous show on Channel 4, which had garnered up to 2.5 million viewers. Due to the decline in viewership, it was announced on 8 May 2009 that the show would be discontinued in July. The presenters commented that the low ratings were due to a lack of audience engagement.

==Other work together==
Richard and Judy co-wrote an autobiography, &quot;Richard and Judy: The Autobiography&quot;, which was published in 2002 by Hodder &amp; Stoughton.

==Political views==
Madeley has expressed support for former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his stance on the Iraq War, noting that international law on the issue was &quot;incredibly complicated.&quot; He has been described by some as aligning with neoconservative views. Madeley has also criticized former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.

In an interview, Madeley identified Cuban leader Fidel Castro as the person he most disliked.

<doc id="521539" wikidata="Q2556223" url="?curid=521539" title="Hoddle Grid">
<text>The Hoddle Grid is the contemporary name given to the approximately grid of streets that form the Melbourne central business district, Australia. Bounded by Flinders Street, Spring Street, La Trobe Street, and Spencer Street, it lies at an angle to the rest of the Melbourne suburban grid, and so is easily recognisable. It is named after the surveyor Robert Hoddle, who marked it out in 1837 (to Lonsdale Street, extended to La Trobe Street the next year), based on the city grid established in the first survey of Melbourne conducted by Robert Russell (architect) in 1836, establishing the first formal town plan. This grid of streets, laid out when there were only a few hundred settlers, became the nucleus for what is now Melbourne, a city of over five million people.

==History==


In 1835 John Batman and John Pascoe Fawkner organised rival groups of free settlers from Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now called Tasmania) to cross Bass Strait and illegally settle on the site of what would become Melbourne. In response, the Imperial authority in London authorised William Lonsdale to lead a party to establish an official settlement the following year. As part of this Robert Russell was appointed as Surveyor and assigned Frederick Robert D&#x27;Arcy and William Wedge Darke as assistants. The grid of streets that is now central Melbourne was established by Robert Russell and his assistants while conducting the first survey of Melbourne in 1836, before Russell returned to Sydney in early 1837.

This grid layout was later adopted by surveyor Robert Hoddle when he arrived in early 1837 with New South Wales Governor Bourke in order to continue survey of the area and regularise the fledgling unauthorised settlement. As Robert Hoddle was the colony&#x27;s surveyor when his plan of Melbourne was officially published this led to the city design being dubbed the Hoddle Grid.

The unusual dimensions of the allotments and the incorporation of narrow &#x27;little&#x27; streets were the result of compromise between Hoddle&#x27;s desire to employ the regulations established in 1829 by previous NSW Governor Ralph Darling, requiring square blocks and wide streets, and Bourke&#x27;s desire for rear access ways (now the &#x27;little&#x27; streets).

The placement of the grid was determined firstly by the fact that the fledgling settlement was already established at that point on the Yarra River, next to a natural shipping basin, just below a rocky outcrop known as &#x27;the falls&#x27;, above which the water was usually fresh. It was placed to run roughly parallel to the course of the river, with its western half closest to the basin, and spanned the mostly gently undulating area between the small hills of Batman&#x27;s Hill to the west, and Eastern Hill. Elizabeth Street, Melbourne in the centre of the grid coincided with the lowest point and roughly paralleled an existing gully.

The streets were surveyed 1 1/2 chains (a chain being 66ft, so they were 99ft; 30m), the blocks at square, with allotments wide, as per Darling&#x27;s Regulations). However, at Governor Bourke&#x27;s insistence, &#x27;little streets&#x27; were inserted east west through the middle of the blocks to allow for rear access to the long, narrow allotments. These were to be , but Bourke&#x27;s suggestion of keeping the allotments the standard size by making the main streets narrower was resisted by Hoddle, leaving them as surveyed, so they became 1/2 chain (33ft; 10m), taken out of the depth of the blocks either side, the end result making the allotments smaller than usual. As per the Darling regulations, the area around the grid was reserved for future expansion and government purposes, and some blocks and allotments were held back from sale and were allocated for government use, a market and a church. The first land sale, of allotments around a block reserved as the site for the Customs House, took place in the settlement on 1 June 1837.

The lack of a public square or formal open space within the grid was criticised as early as 1850, and it has been claimed that Governor Bourke specifically discouraged the inclusion of such spaces “to deter a ‘spirit of democracy’ from breaking out”. However there is little evidence that Bourke had a view on the matter, and the Darling regulations made no mention of including a central square (as either desirable or not). Instead, simple grid plans, with lots or blocks set aside for public buildings and sometimes a park, were standard practice across Australia in government settlements, to facilitate the creation of regular allotments for sale. Notable exceptions include the five central squares of the privately developed plan of Adelaide (also 1839), and the axially placed, though not central, church square set aside in the 1829 plan for Perth. Most of today&#x27;s well known public squares, such as King George Square in Brisbane, Martin Place in Sydney, and Melbourne&#x27;s City Square, were created in the 20th century, by widening streets and demolishing buildings.

Robert Hoddle remained the surveyor for the district until 1853, and laid out all the surrounding subdivisions in a north south, east west grid, excepting the area between La Trobe Street and Victoria Street, which is sometimes included in the &#x27;Hoddle Grid&#x27;, and is usually officially included in the CBD.

This has meant that the original grid sits at a marked angle to the rest of the city, and is easily recognised on any map. Most inhabitants of Melbourne know all the streets of the Hoddle Grid by name, and the order they occur.

The whole town was at first accommodated within the Hoddle Grid, but the huge surge in immigration brought about by the Victorian gold rush in the 1850s quickly outgrew the grid, spreading into the first suburbs in Fitzroy, South Melbourne (Emerald Hill), and beyond.

The Hoddle Grid and its fringes remained the centre and most active part of the city into the mid 20th century, with retail in the centre, fine hotels, banking and prime office space on Collins Street, medical professionals on the Collins Street hill, legal professions around William Street, and warehousing along Flinders Lane and in the western end. Government buildings like GPO, State Library, Supreme Court, and Customs House occupied various blocks, while Parliament House and a government precinct developed on the east side of Spring Street. The swampy area to the south soon hosted rail lines, with many suburban trains converging on Flinders Street railway station near Princes Bridge, the gateway to the city from the south, and Spencer Street station on the western edge was the terminus for country trains, as well as more suburban lines. Up until 1930s, the river bank west of Queen Street River was lined with wharfs for cargo and passenger ships.

Residential uses, most notably the slums of Little Lonsdale Street, were largely replaced by commercial uses by the 1950s, with residential not making a return until the 1990s with the conversion of older buildings. Since the 2000s this has accelerated with numerous high rise apartment buildings and student housing projects. The CBD still retains a central role for retail, with flagship department stores, specialist shops, and luxury brands, and the upper floors of older buildings and down the city&#x27;s famous laneways host a busy nightlife of numerous bars and restaurants, and a street art culture.

==Use of the phrase==

The term &#x27;Hoddle Grid&#x27; emerged in common use only in the 21st century. While it has long been well known that Robert Hoddle surveyed the first officially published plan of the central grid of streets most commonly referred to as &#x27;the City&#x27;, it was not traditionally named after him. In the 19th and early 20th Century the focus was more on Collins Street, the grandest thoroughfare, with the most expensive and exclusive buildings along its length, while the western and northern edges comprised unremarkable low rise residential and light industrial development.

By the 1950s the phrase &#x27;Golden Mile&#x27; comes into use, describing Collins Street itself.

The &quot;Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme Report&quot;, published by the Board of Works in 1954 refers to the area as &#x27;The Central Business Area&#x27;.

The phrase &#x27;CBD&#x27; or Central Business District appears in the 1960s, probably within the publication of the &#x27;Borrie Report&#x27; in 1964, and the subsequent Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme, enacted in 1968. CBD is still the most common phrase to refer to the central grid area of Melbourne.

Official planning strategies in the 1980s and 90s did not use the phrase &#x27;Hoddle Grid&#x27;; for instance the State Government&#x27;s &quot;Central Melbourne : Framework for the Future&quot;, published December 1984, identifies it as &#x27;the formal city grid&#x27; (p25), while the City of Melbourne&#x27;s &#x27;Grids and Greenery&#x27;, published 1987, picks out the skewed grid of streets in various graphics, but only names it as &#x27;the city centre&#x27;.

More recently the Encyclopedia of Melbourne, published in book form in 2005, and online in 2008, calls it the &quot;City Grid&#x27;, while another entry on Roads, describing the wider subdivision of Melbourne, calls the central area &#x27;the Hoddle grid&#x27;.

The phrase appeared in &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper as early as 2002.

==Specifications==

All major streets are in width, while all blocks are exactly square. The total dimensions, including widths of streets, are thus by . The grid&#x27;s longest axis is oriented 70 degrees clockwise from true north, to align better with the course of the Yarra River. The majority of Melbourne is oriented at 8 degrees clockwise from true north - noting that magnetic north was 8.05° E in 1900, increasing to 11.7° E in 2009.

==The Mile Grid==

Robert Hoddle also surveyed a separate north-south grid of streets at one mile spacing around the central city grid. The origin of this grid, marked on the 1837 map, was on the crest of Batman&#x27;s Hill, striking magnetic north for one mile, to an east west line (now Victoria Street/Parade) marking the northern extent of the government reserve outside the central grid. The rest of metropolitan Melbourne generally follows this grid pattern.

<text>Judith Adele Finnigan (born 16 May 1948) is an English television presenter and writer. She co-presented ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; (1988–2001, 2019–2020) and the Channel 4 chat show, &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot; (2001–2008) alongside her husband Richard Madeley. Her debut novel &quot;Eloise&quot;, published in 2012, was a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; bestseller. Her second novel, &quot;I Do Not Sleep&quot;, was published in 2015.

==Early life==
Finnigan was born in Newton Heath, Manchester, on 16 May 1948. The second of three children, she has two brothers: Callum, who is older and Roger, who is younger. Finnigan attended the local Briscoe Lane Primary School. Finnigan then went on to attend Manchester High School for Girls, an independent school in the city, and later studied English and Drama at the University of Bristol.

==Career==
In 1971, Finnigan joined Granada Television as a researcher and in 1974, she moved to Anglia Television in Norwich to become the first female reporter on the &quot;About Anglia&quot; news team. In 1980, Finnigan returned to Granada in Manchester, working on a range of programmes including &quot;Flying Start&quot; (with Anthony Wilson), &quot;Granada Reports&quot; and &quot;Scramble&quot;.

===&quot;This Morning&quot;===
The couple&#x27;s best known programme was &quot;This Morning&quot;, which they hosted from 1988 to 2001. The series, a mix of celebrity interviews, household tips, cookery and phone-ins lasted approximately two hours each weekday morning on ITV. It first aired in October 1988 and was broadcast from the Albert Dock in Liverpool, although production moved to London in 1996. Madeley and Finnigan were so closely associated with the show, that many people referred to the show as &quot;This Morning with Richard and Judy&quot; or simply &quot;Richard and Judy&quot;. In December 2000, at the 6th National Television Awards, &quot;This Morning&quot; won the Daytime Programme category. Both Richard and Judy accepted the award, in which Finnigan suffered a wardrobe malfunction which exposed her bra to the audience at the Royal Albert Hall and television viewers. Once Madeley had noticed the malfunction, he said: &quot;If you vote for us next year she&#x27;ll show you both of them!&quot;

The couple have returned to the show as guests since leaving. In October 2013, they were guests for the show&#x27;s 25th birthday show live from the Albert Dock in Liverpool – the original home of &quot;This Morning&quot;.

===&quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot;===
In 2001, the couple left &quot;This Morning&quot;, having been approached by Channel 4 to host a similar show, simply called &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot;, shown for an hour in the early evenings. The show was produced by Cactus TV, run by Jonathan Ross&#x27; brother, Simon Ross and his wife Amanda.

In February 2007, the couple publicly apologised live on air due to the discovery of a TV quiz phone scam regarding the daily phone in &quot;You Say We Pay&quot;. On the same show, Madeley and Finnigan made the decision to suspend the daily quiz until further notice. Later that week, the media confirmed that police investigations would be pursued, meaning the couple could be subject to a police interview. Channel 4 have admitted the scam may have been in force for two series of the show. While Madeley and Finnigan urged callers to continue entering, it was confirmed that winners were picked in the first ten minutes of the show. The couple both deny being involved in the scam that was revealed by &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; newspaper after it was sold the story through media publicist Jonathan Hartley.

The television show also launched two very successful &quot;clubs&quot;, the &quot;Richard &amp; Judy Book Club&quot; and the &quot;Richard &amp; Judy Wine Club&quot;, both of which are similar in style to those made popular by US TV presenter Oprah Winfrey. The book club featured literature by new and unknown writers. One book was reviewed each week and the winner, named &quot;Read of the Year,&quot; was announced at an awards ceremony.

In July 2008, Finnigan finally underwent a long-awaited knee operation and took a short leave of absence from the show to recuperate fully from the surgery. During this time, Madeley was joined by guest presenters Emma Bunton and Myleene Klass and on 23 July, he presented the episode by himself. On 22 August 2008, the couple&#x27;s Channel 4 series aired its final episode.

After seven years at Channel 4, Finnigan and Madeley began hosting a topical prime-time chat show on UKTV&#x27;s new digital channel, Watch. From 7 October 2008, &quot;Richard and Judy&#x27;s New Position&quot; aired on weeknights from 8pm. The programme still contained popular features such as the &quot;Book Club&quot; and &quot;Summer Read&quot;. The show attracted very low viewing figures, with only 200,000 people for the first episode, and 53,000 for the second. Viewing figures since had consistently fallen, reaching new lows of just 11,000 viewers; their Channel 4 programme would see figures as high as 2,500,000. Consequently, on 8 May 2009, it was announced that the show would end in July, claiming in a statement that viewers &quot;simply couldn&#x27;t find us&quot;.

===&quot;Loose Women&quot;===

On 13 October 2014, it was announced that Finnigan had joined ITV chat show &quot;Loose Women&quot; as a regular panellist.

On her first day, 13 October 2014, Finnigan was criticised when the panel discussed footballer Ched Evans, who was convicted of rape in 2012 before being acquitted in 2016 after two witnesses, who were offered a £50,000 reward for testimony leading to an acquittal, testified to having consensual sex with Evans&#x27; alleged victim around the time of the alleged rape. Finnigan stated that Evans should be able to return to his club as the victim was drunk and the alleged rape was &quot;unpleasant&quot; but &quot;not violent&quot;.

Finnigan stated later in the day: &quot;I apologise unreservedly for any offence that I may have caused as a result of the wording I used.&quot; She continued to make intermittent appearances on the programme, her final appearance on the series being in 2015. Evans was acquitted of any wrongdoing in October 2016.

==Other work==
Finnigan presented a series of video-only specials, looking at a particular character of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and were released in 1995 to mark the soap&#x27;s 35th anniversary.

Finnigan, and her husband, Richard Madeley, were the subjects of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1997 when they were surprised by Michael Aspel live on air while broadcasting &quot;This Morning&quot;.

In 1998, Finnigan presented the ITV &quot;Watchdog&quot; style show &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; in its first series before Caron Keating took over.

Madeley and Finnigan co-wrote their autobiography, &quot;Richard and Judy: The Autobiography&quot;, published in 2002 by Hodder &amp; Stoughton. In 2012, her novel, &quot;Eloise&quot;, was published and became a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; best seller. A second novel, &quot;I Do Not Sleep&quot;, followed in 2015 and a further novel, &quot;Roseland&quot;, in 2023.

==Personal life==
Finnigan met Madeley in 1982 when they worked on separate programmes for Granada TV. At this time, each was in their first marriage. The couple married in 1986 in Manchester and have two children together, both born in Manchester: Jack Christopher (born 1986) and Chloe Susannah (born 1987). Finnigan has twin sons – Dan and Tom (born 1977) – from her first marriage with journalist David Henshaw.

<text>Richard Holt Madeley ( born 13 May 1956) is an English television presenter and writer. Alongside his wife Judy Finnigan, he presented ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; (1988–2001) and the Channel 4 chat show &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot; (2001–2008). Madeley&#x27;s solo projects include the series &quot;&quot; (2007) and covering for &quot;The Chris Evans Breakfast Show&quot; on BBC Radio 2. He was the main relief presenter of Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot; (2012–2017), and since 2017, he has been one of three main relief presenters of ITV breakfast show &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;.

== Early life ==
Madeley was born in Romford, Essex on 13 May 1956, the son of journalist Christopher Holt Madeley (died 1977), from a family of tenant farmers at Kiln Farm, Shawbury, Shropshire, and Mary Claire (&quot;née&quot; McEwan). His mother was Canadian. He attended Shenfield High School in Brentwood.

In 2008, Madeley told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that his father was physically abusive, with little provocation. He estimated that during a period of two years his father beat him with a stick about 25 times. The final and most vicious beating occurred when Richard was aged 10. His father ordered him to remove his shirt and then hit Richard &quot;repeatedly, dementedly, with a stick&quot;. The wounds he suffered kept him away from school. The abuse stopped when his mother, previously out at work so unaware of her husband&#x27;s harsh discipline, told him that she would call the police if it happened again; Madeley stated that after this, his father gave a full and frank apology and he never hit Richard again.

In 2014, Madeley said he was surprised by the level of media interest the beatings generated, &quot;because to me, it was abnormal not to be hit back then&quot;, and said he almost regretted writing about it in his 2008 book &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot;, noting to the general public the beatings are not the defining thing about his father, and calling his father &quot;fun, bright, warm and tactile&quot;. Christopher Madeley had himself been subject to physical abuse by his father, Geoffrey.

== Career ==

Madeley joined BBC Radio Carlisle at the age of 19. He moved to &quot;Granada Reports&quot; in the early 1980s where he met his future wife Judy Finnigan.

=== &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot; ===
The couple left &quot;This Morning&quot; in 2001, having been approached by Channel 4 to host a similar show, called &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot;, shown for an hour in the early evenings. The show was produced by Cactus TV.

In February 2007, Madeley and Finnigan apologised live on air due to the discovery of a TV quiz phone scam regarding the daily phone-in competition &quot;You Say We Pay&quot;. Madeley and Finnigan took the decision to suspend the daily quiz until further notice. Later that week, the news media confirmed that police investigations would be pursued, meaning the couple could be subject to a police interview. Channel 4 admitted the scam may have been in force for two series of the show. Whilst Madeley and Finnigan had urged callers to continue entering, it was confirmed that winners were picked in the first 10 minutes of the show. The couple both denied being involved in the scam.

Due to low audience numbers, the show ended in July 2009. The presenters stated that viewers &quot;simply couldn&#x27;t find us&quot;.

Madeley and Finnigan&#x27;s show &quot;Richard &amp; Judy Book Club&quot; was shown on digital channel Watch.

===Other work===
Whilst working on their daytime show, the couple have been involved in other projects. Madeley and Finnigan won on the season finale of season 2 of a TV version of the classic board game &quot;Cluedo&quot; in 1991. Madeley presented the last two seasons of the game show, quiz show &quot;Connections&quot;, from 1988–1989, and the daytime quiz &quot;Runway&quot; from 1988–1993. In 1991, he presented a series on the world&#x27;s wildest weather, &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot;. He hosted the ITV1 show &quot;&quot; in 2007, and was the presenter for the unaired pilot of the home video show &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Framed&quot; in 1990.

Madeley hosted the news quiz &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; on 14 December 2007, and then featured as a guest panellist in May 2011. He sat in for Richard Bacon on BBC Radio 5 Live. Madeley also covered for &quot;Dawn Patrol&quot; presenter Sarah Kennedy during the week of 27–30 April 2009, for Zoe Ball for two months until 27 February, and on numerous occasions for Chris Evans&#x27; Breakfast Show, all on BBC Radio 2. He appeared on &quot;Piers Morgan&#x27;s Life Stories&quot; in April 2009 and was a guest on &quot;BBC Question Time&quot; in January 2010. In 2011, Madeley was featured in the eighth season of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, tracing his mother&#x27;s ancestors to Canada and the United States. In April 2013, he appeared as a Dictionary Corner guest on &quot;Countdown&quot; for five shows.

Madeley presented his own show on Radio 2, &quot;Madeley on Sunday&quot; (previously &quot;Made on Sunday&quot;), covering for Terry Wogan&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Wogan&quot; over Wogan&#x27;s holidays. Wogan died in January 2016, and Madeley&#x27;s show became a semi-permanent replacement. From April 2016, the slot was shared between Madeley and Michael Ball, with Madeley presenting for approximately 10 weeks a year and Ball taking the remainder.

In 2002, the couple co-wrote their autobiography, &quot;Richard and Judy: The Autobiography&quot;, published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton. In 2008, Madeley wrote the book &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot;, which charts his family history; it was published by Simon &amp; Schuster. Madeley is the author of three novels: &quot;Some Day I&#x27;ll Find You&quot; (2013), &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; (2014) and &quot;The Night Book&quot; (2016).

Madeley and Finnigan were the subjects of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1997 when they were surprised by Michael Aspel live on air while broadcasting &quot;This Morning&quot;.

Since August 2017, Madeley has been a relief presenter on ITV&#x27;s breakfast programme &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;. He has been compared by viewers to the fictional talk show and radio host Alan Partridge for his perceived parallels to Steve Coogan&#x27;s bumbling, tone-deaf comedy character. Madeley himself has remarked that he believes this comparison is &quot;a bit unfair&quot;.

In November 2018, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; appointed Madeley as their agony uncle to succeed Graham Norton who had stood down the previous month. In June 2020, he apologised after being criticised for the advice he gave a reader who thought their neighbour could be experiencing domestic violence. It included the line &quot;If they were going to kill each other, they&#x27;d have done it by now.&quot; The charity Refuge said he had written &quot;appalling and dangerous advice&quot;.

In January 2021, Madeley covered for Steph McGovern on her Channel 4 programme &quot;Steph&#x27;s Packed Lunch&quot; while she had to self-isolate due to the coronavirus pandemic. In November 2021, Madeley was a contestant on the twenty-first series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;., but withdrew after being taken to hospital due to an unspecified illness.

== Personal life ==
Madeley&#x27;s first marriage to Lynda Hooley, at age 21, lasted five years and ended in divorce. Madeley has said that he believes the marriage was a mistake, and he had ten affairs during that time. Nine days after the wedding, while the couple were still on their honeymoon, his father died at the age of 49.

Madeley met Judy Finnigan in 1982 when they worked on separate programmes for Granada Television. At the time, they were both married to other people. The couple married in 1986 in Manchester. They have two children together, both born in Manchester: Jack Christopher (born 1986) and Chloe Susannah (born 1987). They previously lived in Didsbury, Manchester, and moved to Hampstead Garden Suburb, London in 1996 when Granada relocated &quot;This Morning&quot; from Liverpool to London. They also have a second home at Talland Bay, near Polperro, Cornwall having been on holiday together there before their marriage. Madeley is also stepfather to twin sons from Finnigan&#x27;s first marriage to journalist David Henshaw.

In October 2011, Madeley was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Letters from Anglia Ruskin University for his contribution to television, reading, entertainment and media.

In 1994, while the co-host of &quot;This Morning&quot;, Madeley faced legal issues when he was arrested at a Tesco supermarket in Manchester for allegedly failing to pay for certain items, including champagne. He was subsequently acquitted of all shoplifting charges. Madeley attributed the incident to a lapse in memory, stating that he had simply forgotten to pay for the champagne while going through the checkout. Reflecting on the experience years later, he described the incident as a &#x27;horrible cropper&#x27; and said the negative publicity was &#x27;mortifying&#x27;, although he has since been able to joke about it.

==Political views==
Madeley has expressed strong support for former Prime Minister Tony Blair. In a 2001 interview for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he said the UK had got better under New Labour, identified independent MP Martin Bell as his favourite politician, and expressed support for the euro. He supported the Iraq War, saying international law on the issue was &quot;incredibly complicated&quot;.

Madeley was critical of the UK government&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 virus, especially the lockdown response after 24 March 2020, saying there was &quot;no point in running away and hiding from the virus&quot;.

<doc id="521547" wikidata="Q800953" url="?curid=521547" title="Iidabashi Station">
<text>is a major interchange railway station which straddles Tokyo&#x27;s Chiyoda, Shinjuku and Bunkyō wards. It was originally built as Iidamachi Station (albeit in a slightly different location), terminus of the then Kōbu Railway, precursor to today&#x27;s Chūō Line. The Ōedo Line addition to the station in 2000 was designed by architect Makoto Sei Watanabe.

== Lines ==
Iidabashi Station is served by the following above-ground and subway lines.

===Above ground===
* Chūō-Sōbu Line (JB16)

===Subway lines===
* Tokyo Metro Tōzai Line (T-06)
* Tokyo Metro Yūrakuchō Line (Y-13)
* Tokyo Metro Namboku Line (N-10)
* Toei Ōedo Line (E-06)

==Station layout==
The JR East station has one island platform, serving the up and down local lines; there is no platform for the parallel rapid double track (for longer-distance commuter and express Chūō Line trains). The station is located on the inside of the Outer Moat. It is elevated over Mejiro-dori, a major thoroughfare from the Imperial Palace towards Ikebukuro.

===JR East===


===Tokyo Metro===


===Toei===


==History==
The present-day JR East station opened on 15 November 1928.

The station facilities of the Tozai, Namboku and Yurakucho Lines were inherited by Tokyo Metro after the privatization of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA) in 2004.

In 2014, it was announced that the JR East platforms were to be moved and rebuilt approximately 200 m southwest to reduce platform gaps on a sharply curved section of the platform. The new platforms, along with a new west station building, opened on July 12, 2020. In 2022, a large-scale renovation and redevelopment of the station and its environs was launched. With completion scheduled for 2026, the &quot;Iidabashi Station East Area Redevelopment Project&quot; will add a 24-floor mixed-use building to the station complex, containing residential, commercial, and shopping space as well as restaurants.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2013, the JR East station was used by an average of 91,196 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the 46th-busiest JR East station. Over the same fiscal year, the Tokyo Metro station was used by an average of 173,224 passengers daily (exiting and entering passengers), making it the twelfth-busiest station operated by Tokyo Metro. In fiscal 2013, the Toei station was used by an average of 14,577 passengers daily (boarding passengers only). The average daily passenger figures for JR East and Tokyo Metro in previous years are as shown below.

* Note that JR East figures are for boarding passengers only.
The Number of Passengers on Iidabashi as recorded by the East Japan Railway Company Trains in 2017-2022 was 20,197 (（単位　千人）).

==Surrounding area==
Koishikawa Kōrakuen Garden can be reached by walking from this station.
The Iidabashi district extends south and west of the station, and the Kagurazaka extends north and east. The station spans the Kanda River, which separates these two neighborhoods and at this point runs from the southwest towards the northeast.

<doc id="521549" wikidata="Q325082" url="?curid=521549" title="Charles Rocket">
<text>Charles Adams Claverie (August 28, 1949 – October 7, 2005), known by stage names Charlie Hamburger, Charlie Kennedy, and Charles Rocket, was an American actor. He was a cast member on &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; played the villain Nicholas Andre in the film &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;, and played Dave Dennison in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;.

==Early life==
Rocket was born in Bangor, Maine, the son of Mary Aurelia (née Fogler) and Sumner Abbott &quot;Ham&quot; Claverie. He attended Winnacunnet High School and the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in the late 1960s and was part of the Rhode Island underground culture scene in the 1970s that also included Talking Heads frontman David Byrne and film director Gus Van Sant.

==Career==
Rocket made several short films and fronted his band, the Fabulous Motels, on accordion (which he later used in an &quot;SNL&quot; sketch about a crazed criminal who uses an accordion to kill his dates and is killed himself by a bagpipe band). 

He was then a news anchor at WPRI-TV in Providence, Rhode Island and KOAA-TV in Pueblo, Colorado under his own name, and WTVF Nashville under the name Charles Kennedy.

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===
Rocket was cast for the 1980–1981 season, which followed the departure of the remaining members of the show&#x27;s original cast and executive producer Lorne Michaels. Singled out by new executive producer Jean Doumanian, he was promoted as a cross between Bill Murray and Chevy Chase. Rocket was tapped to anchor &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, and was featured in more sketches than any other male cast member that season, with the exception of Joe Piscopo.

Rocket portrayed recurring character Phil Lively, a game show host who took his larger-than-life persona home and treated life as if it were a game show. His celebrity impersonations on &quot;SNL&quot; included Ronald Reagan, David Rockefeller, Prince Charles, and Marlin Perkins. He also hosted &quot;The Rocket Report&quot;, a series of filmed segments where he posed as a roving reporter around New York; in later years, reviewers considered them one of the few consistently strong parts of Doumanian&#x27;s shows.

====Dismissal====
The &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; episode of February 21, 1981, hosted by &quot;Dallas&quot; star Charlene Tilton, featured a parody of the famed &quot;Who shot J.R.?&quot; story arc from the popular nighttime soap. During the show a plot line had Rocket and Tilton flirting while other cast members expressed jealousy, leading to Rocket being shot in the chest by a sniper in the middle of a sketch. In the show&#x27;s closing moments, as cast members gathered with the host to say good night, Tilton asked Rocket how he felt about being shot. In character, Rocket replied &quot;Oh man, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever been shot in my life. I&#x27;d like to know who fuckin&#x27; did it.&quot; 

Due partially to the violation of broadcast standards (though FCC rules weren&#x27;t violated as it was uttered past safe harbor), along with negative press regarding the new cast and declining ratings for both the series and the network in general, NBC replaced Doumanian with Dick Ebersol after one further episode. Ebersol, who placed the show on hiatus for a month to retool, dismissed Rocket, along with several of the writers and fellow cast members Gilbert Gottfried and Ann Risley, before the next episode. A writers&#x27; strike led to the suspension of the rest of the season, and when the show returned in October 1981, Joe Piscopo and Eddie Murphy were the only cast members who were held over from Doumanian&#x27;s era. &quot;Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live&quot; revealed that Rocket was particularly hostile toward Murphy and Piscopo, as he believed the two isolated themselves from the rest of the cast.

===Post-&quot;SNL&quot; career===
After SNL, Rocket worked steadily in film, with roles in such films as &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;, &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot;, &quot;Steal Big Steal Little&quot;, &quot;How I Got into College&quot;, &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; and &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;, often playing comic foils.

On television, in addition to guest spots on several 1980s sitcoms, he played antagonist network president Ned Grossberg on the cyberpunk series &quot;Max Headroom&quot;, Richard Addison (brother to Bruce Willis&#x27;s David Addison) on the comedy-drama &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, and Adam, an angel of death, on &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;. He later guest starred in other series including &quot;Wings&quot; as Danny, a long time friend to Brian Hackett (Steven Weber), &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; as Grant, a physics professor, and &quot;The King of Queens&quot; as Steve Moscow, a Russian contractor who is hired to remove mold from Doug and Carrie Heffernan&#x27;s house.

In addition to his acting work, Rocket played accordion on the David Byrne-produced B-52&#x27;s album &quot;Mesopotamia &quot;on the track &quot;Loveland&quot;, and the album &quot;Amarcord Nino Rota&quot; on the track &quot;La Dolce Vita Suite&quot;, produced by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; music coordinator Hal Willner.

He also provided the voice of Leo Lionheart Jr. in the &quot;MGM Sing-Alongs&quot; videos in 1996.

==Personal life==
Rocket married his college girlfriend, Beth Crellin, on board the battleship USS &quot;Massachusetts&quot; anchored in Fall River, Massachusetts, in 1972. Their son, Zane, was born in 1976.

===Death===
Rocket was found dead in a field on his Connecticut property on October 7, 2005, with his throat slit. He was 56 years old. Ten days later, the state medical examiner ruled the death as suicide. The police investigation determined that there was no criminal aspect to the case.

<doc id="521550" wikidata="Q3117457" url="?curid=521550" title="Jean Coutu Group">
<text>Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc. is a Canadian drugstore chain headquartered in Varennes, Quebec. It has more than 400 franchised locations in New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec under the PJC Jean Coutu, PJC Clinique, and PJC Santé banners. The company was once the third largest distributor and retailer of pharmaceuticals and related products in North America, with nearly 2,200 drug stores. It previously operated stores in the United States under its U.S. subsidiary The Jean Coutu Group (PJC) USA, Inc., using the Brooks Pharmacy and Eckerd Drugs banners, until it was sold to Rite Aid in 2007 (the subsidiary itself is still active and operates in-name-only under Rite Aid, but its stores have since been converted to Rite Aid).

The company is also known for its private line &quot;Personnelle&quot;, which produces a wide variety of products such as cosmetics, papers, and pharmaceutical products. Since 2017, the main distribution warehouse is located in Varennes, Quebec (after Longueuil 1976-2015), though there is also a large distribution warehouse in Hawkesbury, Ontario, since 2005.

== History ==
The company was co-founded in 1969 by Jean Coutu and Louis Michaud, as a pharmacy in the east end of Montreal under the name Pharm-Escomptes Jean Coutu.

The company became incorporated in 1973 under the name Services Farmico, enticed by the five branches already set up in Montreal. The name was changed 13 years later to its current name, the Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc., and was put on the stock exchange. In 1982 it entered the New Brunswick market and then the Ontario market in 1983. Beginning in 1987, the company began a series of acquisitions that continues. Over the past 20 years, the Jean Coutu Group has acquired Cadieux drugstores, twelve Cloutier Pharmacy outlets, sixteen Douglas Drug Inc. outlets, 221 outlets of the Brooks Drug Store, Rite Aid drugstores, retail properties, eight Mayrand drugstores, 19 Cumberland stores, and many more in the United States. The Jean Coutu Group was the first in Canada to set up an online service allowing customers to refill their prescriptions, expanding the concept a year later with the same functionality that could be done over the telephone. Some of the titles this corporation has earned include &quot;Canada’s Most Respected Corporations&quot;, and &quot;The Most Admired Company in Quebec&quot;, which it has won seven times.

With the majority of its franchises in Quebec, it is the province from which it receives most of its revenue, although it has also gotten a great deal of profit from the United States. The main competition are Loblaws and Shoppers Drug Mart, Wal-Mart, Familiprix, Brunet, and Uniprix.

Since the end of the 1980s, the corporation has merged and acquired much of its competition. It has become one of the leading companies in Quebec and has been growing throughout the other provinces and into the United States because of its successful integration of acquisitions. There are many different trademarks and they are continuously increasing due to these mergers. Jean Coutu is a public company and is listed under PJC.A.TO. on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

In May 2013, Jean Coutu announced that it would move its head office from Longueuil to Varennes, because the present head office is too small. At a cost of $190 million, the new building will be near Autoroute 30 and it will be ready for 2016.

In September 2017, Jean Coutu announced it was in talks to be acquired by Metro Inc, a Canadian supermarket chain, for approximately C$4.50bn. The deal closed in May 2018.
=== Jean Coutu Group USA ===

Coutu&#x27;s U.S. subsidiary, Warwick, Rhode Island–based Jean Coutu Group (PJC) USA, Inc., operated primarily along the east coast, under the Brooks Pharmacy banner in New England and Eckerd Pharmacy from Upstate New York and Pennsylvania south to Georgia. Coutu sold off its U.S. operations in a deal with Rite Aid in 2007. (Despite this, the subsidiary itself remains active as an in-name only subsidiary of Rite Aid Corporation, also notwithstanding the rebranding of the ex-Coutu chains as Rite Aids in 2007.) Coutu had purchased Brooks in 1994 from the now-defunct Revco drug chain. (Revco had acquired Brooks a few months earlier as part of its acquisition of Hook&#x27;s-SupeRx, Inc, once a large operator of several pharmacy chains.)

In mid-2004, Coutu acquired more than half of the Eckerd store network (mainly units along the eastern seaboard) from department store retailer J.C. Penney. It continued to operate those stores under the Eckerd name. (The remainder of Eckerd&#x27;s stores were sold to CVS Pharmacy.) From 1999 to 2004 the chain was the second fastest-growing retailer in the world. In the second quarter of 2005, the company recorded a $19.7 million US foreign exchange loss on items related to the Eckerd acquisition. On August 24, 2006, Rite Aid announced that it would acquire 1,858 Jean Coutu&#x27;s Eckerd and Brooks U.S. operations for $1.45 billion in cash and issuing stock, giving Jean Coutu a 32% equity stake in Rite Aid. Rite Aid announced the acquisition completed on June 4, 2007.

In July 2013, Coutu proceeded to the sale of its last shares of Rite Aid that it held. Jean Coutu no longer holds any shares of Rite Aid.

In 2023, Rite Aid filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Despite Jean Coutu being separated from Rite Aid 10 years prior, Jean Coutu was still listed in the filing.

=== Jean Coutu Controversies ===

In August 2022, a Quebec pharmacist made headlines by refusing to sell a customer emergency oral contraception, better known as the morning-after pill, because it went against his religious beliefs.

<doc id="521553" wikidata="Q193183" url="?curid=521553" title="Alès">
<text>Alès () is a commune and subprefecture in the Gard department in the Occitania region in Southern France. Until 1926, it was officially known as &quot;Alais&quot;.

==Geography==
Alès lies north-northwest of Nîmes, on the left bank of the river Gardon d&#x27;Alès, which half surrounds it. It is located at the foot of the Cévennes, near the Cévennes National Park. Alès station has rail connections to Nîmes, Mende and Clermont-Ferrand.

==History==

Alès may be the modern successor of Arisitum, where, in about 570, Sigebert, King of Austrasia, created a bishopric. In his campaign against the Visigoths, the Merovingian king Theudebert I (533–548) conquered part of the territory of the Diocese of Nîmes. His later successor Sigebert set up the new diocese, comprising fifteen parishes in the area controlled by the Franks, which included a number of towns to the north of the Cevenne: Alès, Le Vigan, Arre, Arrigas, Meyrueis, Saint-Jean-du-Gard, Anduze, and Vissec. The diocese disappeared in the 8th century with the conquest of the whole of Septimania by the Franks. No longer a residential bishopric, Arisitum is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

After the Edict of Nantes, Alès was one of the &quot;places de sûreté&quot; given to the Huguenots. Louis XIII took back the town in 1629, and the Peace of Alès, signed on 29 June of that year, suppressed the political privileges of the Protestants, while continuing to guarantee toleration.

At the request of Louis XIV, a see was again created at Alais by Pope Innocent XII, in 1694. The future Cardinal de Bausset, Bossuet&#x27;s biographer, was Bishop of Alais from 1784 to 1790. It was suppressed after the French Revolution, and its territory was divided between the diocese of Avignon and the diocese of Mende.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
Alès is the centre of a mining district and hosts the École des Mines d&#x27;Alès.

Historically, according to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition (1911):
:&quot;The town is one of the most important markets for raw silk and cocoons in the south of France, and the Gardon supplies power to numerous silk-mills. It is also the centre of a mineral field, which yields large quantities of coal, iron, zinc and lead; its blast-furnaces, foundries, glass-works and engineering works afford employment to many workmen.&quot;

==Sports==
The town has one association football team called Olympique Alès who currently play in the Championnat National.

==Sights==
Historically, according to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition:
:&quot;The streets are wide and its promenades and fine plane-trees make the town attractive; but the public buildings, the chief of which are the Saint-Jean-Baptiste cathedral, a heavy building of the 18th century, and the citadel, which serves as barracks and prison, are of small interest.&quot;

<doc id="521555" wikidata="Q1747689" url="?curid=521555" title="Ancient Rome">
<text>In modern historiography, ancient Rome is the Roman civilisation from the founding of the Italian city of Rome in the 8th century BC to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. It encompasses the Roman Kingdom (753–509 BC), the Roman Republic (50927 BC), and the Roman Empire (27 BC476 AD) until the fall of the western empire.

Ancient Rome began as an Italic settlement, traditionally dated to 753 BC, beside the River Tiber in the Italian peninsula. The settlement grew into the city and polity of Rome, and came to control its neighbours through a combination of treaties and military strength. It eventually controlled the Italian Peninsula, assimilating the Greek culture of southern Italy (Magna Graecia) and the Etruscan culture, and then became the dominant power in the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. At its height it controlled the North African coast, Egypt, Southern Europe, and most of Western Europe, the Balkans, Crimea, and much of the Middle East, including Anatolia, the Levant, and parts of Mesopotamia and Arabia. That empire was among the largest empires in the ancient world, covering around in AD 117, with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants, roughly 20% of the world&#x27;s population at the time. The Roman state evolved from an elective monarchy to a classical republic and then to an increasingly autocratic military dictatorship during the Empire.

Ancient Rome is often grouped into classical antiquity together with ancient Greece, and their similar cultures and societies are known as the Greco-Roman world. Ancient Roman civilisation has contributed to modern language, religion, society, technology, law, politics, government, warfare, art, literature, architecture, and engineering. Rome professionalised and expanded its military and created a system of government called , the inspiration for modern republics such as the United States and France. It achieved impressive technological and architectural feats, such as the empire-wide construction of aqueducts and roads, as well as more grandiose monuments and facilities.

== History ==

=== Early Italy and the founding of Rome ===

Archaeological evidence of settlement around Rome starts to emerge . Large-scale organisation appears only , with the first graves in the Esquiline Hill&#x27;s necropolis, along with a clay and timber wall on the bottom of the Palatine Hill dating to the middle of the 8th century BC. Starting from , the Romans started to drain the valley between the Capitoline and Palatine Hills, where today sits the Roman Forum. By the 6th century BC, the Romans were constructing the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline and expanding to the Forum Boarium located between the Capitoline and Aventine Hills.

The Romans themselves had a founding myth, attributing their city to Romulus and Remus, offspring of Mars and a princess of the mythical city of Alba Longa. The sons, sentenced to death, were rescued by a wolf and returned to restore the Alban king and found a city. After a dispute, Romulus killed Remus and became the city&#x27;s sole founder. The area of his initial settlement on the Palatine Hill was later known as Roma quadrata (&#x27;Square Rome&#x27;). The story dates at least to the 3rd century BC, and the later Roman antiquarian Marcus Terentius Varro placed the city&#x27;s foundation to 753 BC. Another legend, recorded by Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus, says that Prince Aeneas led a group of Trojans on a sea voyage to found a new Troy after the Trojan War. They landed on the banks of the Tiber River and a woman travelling with them, Roma, torched their ships to prevent them leaving again. They named the settlement after her. The Roman poet Virgil recounted this legend in his classical epic poem the &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

=== Kingdom ===

Literary and archaeological evidence is clear on there having been kings in Rome, attested in fragmentary 6th-century BC texts. Long after the abolition of the Roman monarchy, a vestigial was retained to exercise the monarch&#x27;s former priestly functions. The Romans believed that their monarchy was elective, with seven legendary kings who were largely unrelated by blood.

Evidence of Roman expansion is clear in the 6th century BC; by its end, Rome controlled a territory of some with a population perhaps as high as 35,000. A palace, the Regia, was constructed ; the Romans attributed the creation of their first popular organisations and the Senate to the regal period as well. Rome also started to extend its control over its Latin neighbours. While later Roman stories like the &quot;Aeneid&quot; asserted that all Latins descended from the character Aeneas, a common culture is attested to archaeologically. Attested to reciprocal rights of marriage and citizenship between Latin cities—the —along with shared religious festivals, further indicate a shared culture. By the end of the 6th century, most of this area had become dominated by the Romans.

=== Republic ===

By the end of the sixth century, Rome and many of its Italian neighbours entered a period of turbulence. Archaeological evidence implies some degree of large-scale warfare. According to tradition and later writers such as Livy, the Roman Republic was established , when the last of the seven kings of Rome, Tarquin the Proud, was deposed and a system based on annually elected magistrates and various representative assemblies was established. A constitution set a series of checks and balances, and a separation of powers. The most important magistrates were the two consuls, who together exercised executive authority such as , or military command. The consuls had to work with the Senate, which was initially an advisory council of the ranking nobility, or patricians, but grew in size and power.

Other magistrates of the Republic include tribunes, quaestors, aediles, praetors and censors. The magistracies were originally restricted to patricians, but were later opened to common people, or plebeians. Republican voting assemblies included the (&#x27;centuriate assembly&#x27;), which voted on matters of war and peace and elected men to the most important offices, and the (&#x27;tribal assembly&#x27;), which elected less important offices.

In the 4th century BC, Rome had come under attack by the Gauls, who now extended their power in the Italian peninsula beyond the Po Valley and through Etruria. On 16 July 390 BC, a Gallic army under the leadership of tribal chieftain Brennus, defeated the Romans at the Battle of the Allia and marched to Rome. The Gauls looted and burned the city, then laid siege to the Capitoline Hill, where some Romans had barricaded themselves, for seven months. The Gauls then agreed to give the Romans peace in exchange for 1000 pounds of gold. According to later legend, the Roman supervising the weighing noticed that the Gauls were using false scales. The Romans then took up arms and defeated the Gauls. Their victorious general Camillus remarked &quot;With iron, not with gold, Rome buys her freedom.&quot;

The Romans gradually subdued the other peoples on the Italian peninsula, including the Etruscans. The last threat to Roman hegemony in Italy came when Tarentum, a major Greek colony, enlisted the aid of Pyrrhus of Epirus in 281 BC, but this effort failed as well. The Romans secured their conquests by founding Roman colonies in strategic areas, thereby establishing stable control over the region.

==== Punic Wars ====

In the 3rd century BC Rome faced a new and formidable opponent: Carthage, the other major power in the Western Mediterranean. The First Punic War began in 264 BC, when the city of Messana asked for Carthage&#x27;s help in their conflicts with Hiero II of Syracuse. After the Carthaginian intercession, Messana asked Rome to expel the Carthaginians. Rome entered this war because Syracuse and Messana were too close to the newly conquered Greek cities of Southern Italy and Carthage was now able to make an offensive through Roman territory; along with this, Rome could extend its domain over Sicily.

Carthage was a maritime power, and the Roman lack of ships and naval experience made the path to the victory a long and difficult one for the Roman Republic. Despite this, after more than 20 years of war, Rome defeated Carthage and a peace treaty was signed. Among the reasons for the Second Punic War was the subsequent war reparations Carthage acquiesced to at the end of the First Punic War. The war began with the audacious invasion of Hispania by Hannibal, who marched through Hispania to the Italian Alps. Hannibal&#x27;s invasion lasted over 16 years, ravaging Italy, but ultimately Carthage was defeated in the decisive Battle of Zama in October 202 BC.

More than a half century after these events, Carthage was left humiliated and the Republic&#x27;s focus was now directed towards the Hellenistic kingdoms of Greece and revolts in Hispania. However, Carthage, having paid the war indemnity, felt that its commitments and submission to Rome had ceased, a vision not shared by the Roman Senate. The Third Punic War began when Rome declared war against Carthage in 149 BC. Carthage resisted well at the first strike but could not withstand the attack of Scipio Aemilianus, who entirely destroyed the city, enslaved all the citizens and gained control of that region, which became the province of Africa. All these wars resulted in Rome&#x27;s first overseas conquests (Sicily, Hispania and Africa) and the rise of Rome as a significant imperial power.

=== Late Republic ===
After defeating the Macedonian and Seleucid Empires in the 2nd century BC, the Romans became the dominant people of the Mediterranean Sea. The conquest of the Hellenistic kingdoms brought the Roman and Greek cultures in closer contact and the Roman elite, once rural, became cosmopolitan.
Foreign dominance led to internal strife. Senators became rich at the provinces&#x27; expense; soldiers, who were mostly small-scale farmers, were away from home longer and could not maintain their land; and the increased reliance on foreign slaves and the growth of reduced the availability of paid work. Income from war booty, mercantilism in the new provinces, and tax farming created new economic opportunities for the wealthy, forming a new class of merchants, called the equestrians. The &quot;&quot; forbade members of the Senate from engaging in commerce, so while the equestrians could theoretically join the Senate, they were severely restricted in political power. The Senate squabbled perpetually, repeatedly blocked important land reforms and refused to give the equestrian class a larger say in the government.

Violent gangs of the urban unemployed, controlled by rival Senators, intimidated the electorate through violence. The situation came to a head in the late 2nd century BC under the Gracchi brothers, a pair of tribunes who attempted to pass land reform legislation that would redistribute the major patrician landholdings among the plebeians. Both brothers were killed and the Senate passed reforms reversing the Gracchi brother&#x27;s actions. This led to the growing divide of the plebeian groups () and equestrian classes ().

Gaius Marius soon became a leader of the Republic, holding the first of his seven consulships (an unprecedented number) in 107 BC by arguing that his former patron Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus was not able to defeat and capture the Numidian king Jugurtha. Marius then started his military reform: in his recruitment to fight Jugurtha, he levied the very poor (an innovation), and many landless men entered the army. Marius was elected for five consecutive consulships from 104 to 100 BC, as Rome needed a military leader to defeat the Cimbri and the Teutones, who were threatening Rome. After Marius&#x27;s retirement, Rome had a brief peace, during which the Italian (&#x27;allies&#x27;) requested Roman citizenship and voting rights. The reformist Marcus Livius Drusus supported their legal process but was assassinated, and the revolted against the Romans in the Social War. At one point both consuls were killed; Marius was appointed to command the army together with Lucius Julius Caesar and Lucius Cornelius Sulla.

By the end of the Social War, Marius and Sulla were the premier military men in Rome and their partisans were in conflict, both sides jostling for power. In 88 BC, Sulla was elected for his first consulship and his first assignment was to defeat Mithridates VI of Pontus, whose intentions were to conquer the Eastern part of the Roman territories. However, Marius&#x27;s partisans managed his installation to the military command, defying Sulla and the Senate. To consolidate his own power, Sulla conducted a surprising and illegal action: he marched to Rome with his legions, killing all those who showed support to Marius&#x27;s cause. In the following year, 87 BC, Marius, who had fled at Sulla&#x27;s march, returned to Rome while Sulla was campaigning in Greece. He seized power along with the consul Lucius Cornelius Cinna and killed the other consul, Gnaeus Octavius, achieving his seventh consulship. Marius and Cinna revenged their partisans by conducting a massacre.

Marius died in 86 BC, due to age and poor health, just a few months after seizing power. Cinna exercised absolute power until his death in 84 BC. After returning from his Eastern campaigns, Sulla had a free path to reestablish his own power. In 83 BC he made his second march on Rome and began a time of terror: thousands of nobles, knights and senators were executed. Sulla held two dictatorships and one more consulship, which began the crisis and decline of Roman Republic.

==== Caesar and the First Triumvirate ====
In the mid-1st century BC, Roman politics were restless. Political divisions in Rome split into one of two groups, (who hoped for the support of the people) and (the &#x27;best&#x27;, who wanted to maintain exclusive aristocratic control). Sulla overthrew all populist leaders and his constitutional reforms removed powers (such as those of the tribune of the plebs) that had supported populist approaches. Meanwhile, social and economic stresses continued to build; Rome had become a metropolis with a super-rich aristocracy, debt-ridden aspirants, and a large proletariat often of impoverished farmers. The latter groups supported the Catilinarian conspiracy—a resounding failure since the consul Marcus Tullius Cicero quickly arrested and executed the main leaders.

Gaius Julius Caesar reconciled the two most powerful men in Rome: Marcus Licinius Crassus, who had financed much of his earlier career, and Crassus&#x27; rival, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (anglicised as Pompey), to whom he married his daughter. He formed them into a new informal alliance including himself, the First Triumvirate (&#x27;three men&#x27;). Caesar&#x27;s daughter died in childbirth in 54 BC, and in 53 BC, Crassus invaded Parthia and was killed in the Battle of Carrhae; the Triumvirate disintegrated. Caesar conquered Gaul, obtained immense wealth, respect in Rome and the loyalty of battle-hardened legions. He became a threat to Pompey and was loathed by many . Confident that Caesar could be stopped by legal means, Pompey&#x27;s party tried to strip Caesar of his legions, a prelude to Caesar&#x27;s trial, impoverishment, and exile.

To avoid this fate, Caesar crossed the Rubicon River and invaded Rome in 49 BC. The Battle of Pharsalus was a brilliant victory for Caesar and in this and other campaigns, he destroyed all of the &quot;optimates&quot; leaders: Metellus Scipio, Cato the Younger, and Pompey&#x27;s son, Gnaeus Pompeius. Pompey was murdered in Egypt in 48 BC. Caesar was now pre-eminent over Rome: in five years he held four consulships, two ordinary dictatorships, and two special dictatorships, one for perpetuity. He was murdered in 44 BC, on the Ides of March by the &quot;Liberatores&quot;.

==== Octavian and the Second Triumvirate ====
Caesar&#x27;s assassination caused political and social turmoil in Rome; the city was ruled by his friend and colleague, Marcus Antonius. Soon afterward, Octavius, whom Caesar adopted through his will, arrived in Rome. Octavian (historians regard Octavius as Octavian due to the Roman naming conventions) tried to align himself with the Caesarian faction. In 43 BC, along with Antony and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Caesar&#x27;s best friend, he legally established the Second Triumvirate. Upon its formation, 130–300 senators were executed, and their property was confiscated, due to their supposed support for the &quot;Liberatores&quot;.

In 42 BC, the Senate deified Caesar as &quot;Divus Iulius&quot;; Octavian thus became &quot;Divi filius&quot;, the son of the deified. In the same year, Octavian and Antony defeated both Caesar&#x27;s assassins and the leaders of the &quot;Liberatores&quot;, Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus, in the Battle of Philippi. The Second Triumvirate was marked by the proscriptions of many senators and &quot;equites&quot;: after a revolt led by Antony&#x27;s brother Lucius Antonius, more than 300 senators and &quot;equites&quot; involved were executed, although Lucius was spared.

The Triumvirate divided the Empire among the triumvirs: Lepidus was given charge of Africa, Antony, the eastern provinces, and Octavian remained in Italia and controlled Hispania and Gaul. The Second Triumvirate expired in 38 BC but was renewed for five more years. However, the relationship between Octavian and Antony had deteriorated, and Lepidus was forced to retire in 36 BC after betraying Octavian in Sicily. By the end of the Triumvirate, Antony was living in Ptolemaic Egypt, ruled by his lover, Cleopatra VII. Antony&#x27;s affair with Cleopatra was seen as an act of treason, since she was queen of another country. Additionally, Antony adopted a lifestyle considered too extravagant and Hellenistic for a Roman statesman. Following Antony&#x27;s Donations of Alexandria, which gave to Cleopatra the title of &quot;Queen of Kings&quot;, and to Antony&#x27;s and Cleopatra&#x27;s children the regal titles to the newly conquered Eastern territories, war between Octavian and Antony broke out. Octavian annihilated Egyptian forces in the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide. Now Egypt was conquered by the Roman Empire.

=== Empire – the Principate ===

In 27 BC and at the age of 36, Octavian was the sole Roman leader. In that year, he took the name &quot;Augustus&quot;. That event is usually taken by historians as the beginning of Roman Empire. Officially, the government was republican, but Augustus assumed absolute powers. His reform of the government brought about a two-century period colloquially referred to by Romans as the Pax Romana.

==== Julio-Claudian dynasty ====
The Julio-Claudian dynasty was established by Augustus. The emperors of this dynasty were Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero. The Julio-Claudians started the destruction of republican values, but on the other hand, they boosted Rome&#x27;s status as the central power in the Mediterranean region. While Caligula and Nero are usually remembered in popular culture as dysfunctional emperors, Augustus and Claudius are remembered as successful in politics and the military. This dynasty instituted imperial tradition in Rome and frustrated any attempt to reestablish a Republic.

Augustus () gathered almost all the republican powers under his official title, , and diminished the political influence of the senatorial class by boosting the equestrian class. The senators lost their right to rule certain provinces, like Egypt, since the governor of that province was directly nominated by the emperor. The creation of the Praetorian Guard and his reforms in the military, creating a standing army with a fixed size of 28 legions, ensured his total control over the army. Compared with the Second Triumvirate&#x27;s epoch, Augustus&#x27; reign as was very peaceful, which led the people and the nobles of Rome to support Augustus, increasing his strength in political affairs. His generals were responsible for the field command, gaining such commanders as Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, Nero Claudius Drusus and Germanicus much respect from the populace and the legions. Augustus intended to extend the Roman Empire to the whole known world, and in his reign, Rome conquered Cantabria, Aquitania, Raetia, Dalmatia, Illyricum and Pannonia.
Under Augustus&#x27; reign, Roman literature grew steadily in what is known as the Golden Age of Latin Literature. Poets like Virgil, Horace, Ovid and Rufus developed a rich literature, and were close friends of Augustus. Along with Maecenas, he sponsored patriotic poems, such as Virgil&#x27;s epic &quot;Aeneid&quot; and historiographical works like those of Livy. Augustus continued the changes to the calendar promoted by Caesar, and the month of August is named after him. Augustus brought a peaceful and thriving era to Rome, known as &quot;Pax Romana&quot;.
The Julio-Claudians continued to rule Rome after Augustus&#x27; death in 14 AD and remained in power until the death of Nero in 68 AD. Influenced by his wife, Livia Drusilla, Augustus appointed her son from another marriage, Tiberius, as his heir. The Senate agreed with the succession, and granted to Tiberius the same titles and honours once granted to Augustus: the title of and , and the Civic Crown. However, Tiberius was not an enthusiast for political affairs: after agreement with the Senate, he retired to Capri in 26 AD, and left control of the city of Rome in the hands of the praetorian prefect Sejanus (until 31 AD) and Macro (from 31 to 37 AD).

Tiberius died (or was killed) in 37 AD. The male line of the Julio-Claudians was limited to Tiberius&#x27; nephew Claudius, his grandson Tiberius Gemellus and his grand-nephew Caligula. As Gemellus was still a child, Caligula was chosen to rule the empire. He was a popular leader in the first half of his reign, but became a crude and insane tyrant in his years controlling government. The Praetorian Guard murdered Caligula four years after the death of Tiberius, and, with belated support from the senators, proclaimed his uncle Claudius as the new emperor. Claudius was not as authoritarian as Tiberius and Caligula. Claudius conquered Lycia and Thrace; his most important deed was the beginning of the conquest of Britannia. Claudius was poisoned by his wife, Agrippina the Younger in 54 AD. His heir was Nero, son of Agrippina and her former husband, since Claudius&#x27; son Britannicus had not reached manhood upon his father&#x27;s death.

Nero sent his general, Suetonius Paulinus, to invade modern-day Wales, where he encountered stiff resistance. The Celts there were independent, tough, resistant to tax collectors, and fought Paulinus as he battled his way across from east to west. It took him a long time to reach the north-west coast, and in 60 AD he finally crossed the Menai Strait to the sacred island of Mona (Anglesey), the last stronghold of the druids. His soldiers attacked the island and massacred the druids: men, women and children, destroyed the shrine and the sacred groves and threw many of the sacred standing stones into the sea. While Paulinus and his troops were massacring druids in Mona, the tribes of modern-day East Anglia staged a revolt led by queen Boadicea of the Iceni. The rebels sacked and burned Camulodunum, Londinium and Verulamium (modern-day Colchester, London and St Albans respectively) before they were crushed by Paulinus. Boadicea, like Cleopatra before her, committed suicide to avoid the disgrace of being paraded in triumph in Rome. Nero is widely known as the first persecutor of Christians and for the Great Fire of Rome, rumoured to have been started by the emperor himself. A conspiracy against Nero in 65 AD under Calpurnius Piso failed, but in 68 AD the armies under Julius Vindex in Gaul and Servius Sulpicius Galba in modern-day Spain revolted. Deserted by the Praetorian Guards and condemned to death by the senate, Nero killed himself.

==== Flavian dynasty ====

The Flavians were the second dynasty to rule Rome. By 68 AD, the year of Nero&#x27;s death, there was no chance of a return to the Republic, and so a new emperor had to arise. After the turmoil in the Year of the Four Emperors, Titus Flavius Vespasianus (anglicised as Vespasian) took control of the empire and established a new dynasty. Under the Flavians, Rome continued its expansion, and the state remained secure. Under Trajan, the Roman Empire reached the peak of its territorial expansion. Rome&#x27;s dominion now spanned .

The most significant military campaign undertaken during the Flavian period was the siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD by Titus. The destruction of the city was the culmination of the Roman campaign in Judea following the Jewish uprising of 66 AD. The Second Temple was completely demolished, after which Titus&#x27; soldiers proclaimed him &quot;imperator&quot; in honour of the victory. Jerusalem was sacked and much of the population killed or dispersed. Josephus claims that 1,100,000 people were killed during the siege, of whom a majority were Jewish. 97,000 were captured and enslaved. Many fled to areas around the Mediterranean.

Vespasian was a general under Claudius and Nero and fought as a commander in the First Jewish-Roman War. Following the turmoil of the Year of the Four Emperors, in 69 AD, four emperors were enthroned in turn: Galba, Otho, Vitellius, and, lastly, Vespasian, who crushed Vitellius&#x27; forces and became emperor. He reconstructed many buildings which were uncompleted, like a statue of Apollo and the temple of &quot;Divus Claudius&quot; (&quot;the deified Claudius&quot;), both initiated by Nero. Buildings destroyed by the Great Fire of Rome were rebuilt, and he revitalised the Capitol. Vespasian started the construction of the Flavian Amphitheater, commonly known as the Colosseum. The historians Josephus and Pliny the Elder wrote their works during Vespasian&#x27;s reign. Vespasian was Josephus&#x27; sponsor and Pliny dedicated his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; to Titus, son of Vespasian. Vespasian sent legions to defend the eastern frontier in Cappadocia, extended the occupation in Britannia (modern-day England, Wales and southern Scotland) and reformed the tax system. He died in 79 AD.

Titus became emperor in 79. He finished the Flavian Amphitheater, using war spoils from the First Jewish-Roman War, and hosted victory games that lasted for a hundred days. These games included gladiatorial combats, horse races and a sensational mock naval battle on the flooded grounds of the Colosseum. Titus died of fever in 81 AD, and was succeeded by his brother Domitian. As emperor, Domitian showed the characteristics of a tyrant. He ruled for fifteen years, during which time he acquired a reputation for self-promotion as a living god. He constructed at least two temples in honour of Jupiter, the supreme deity in Roman religion. He was murdered following a plot within his own household.

==== Nerva–Antonine dynasty ====

Following Domitian&#x27;s murder, the Senate rapidly appointed Nerva as Emperor. Nerva had noble ancestry, and he had served as an advisor to Nero and the Flavians. His rule restored many of the traditional liberties of Rome&#x27;s upper classes, which Domitian had over-ridden. The Nerva–Antonine dynasty from 96 AD to 192 AD included the &quot;five good emperors&quot; Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius. Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius were part of Italic families settled in Roman colonies outside of Italy: the families of Trajan and Hadrian had settled in Italica (Hispania Baetica), that of Antoninus Pius in Colonia Agusta Nemausensis (Gallia Narbonensis), and that of Marcus Aurelius in Colonia Claritas Iulia Ucubi (Hispania Baetica). The Nerva-Antonine dynasty came to an end with Commodus, son of Marcus Aurelius.

Nerva abdicated and died in 98 AD, and was succeeded by the general Trajan. Trajan is credited with the restoration of traditional privileges and rights of commoner and senatorial classes, which later Roman historians claim to have been eroded during Domitian&#x27;s autocracy. Trajan fought three Dacian wars, winning territories roughly equivalent to modern-day Romania and Moldova. He undertook an ambitious public building program in Rome, including Trajan&#x27;s Forum, Trajan&#x27;s Market and Trajan&#x27;s Column, with the architect Apollodorus of Damascus. He remodelled the Pantheon and extended the Circus Maximus. When Parthia appointed a king for Armenia without consulting Rome, Trajan declared war on Parthia and deposed the king of Armenia. In 115 he took the Northern Mesopotamian cities of Nisibis and Batnae, organised a province of Mesopotamia (116), and issued coins that claimed Armenia and Mesopotamia were under the authority of the Roman people. In that same year, he captured Seleucia and the Parthian capital Ctesiphon (near modern Baghdad). After defeating a Parthian revolt and a Jewish revolt, he withdrew due to health issues, and in 117, he died of edema.

 Trajan&#x27;s successor Hadrian withdrew all the troops stationed in Parthia, Armenia and Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq), abandoning Trajan&#x27;s conquests. Hadrian&#x27;s army crushed a revolt in Mauretania and the Bar Kokhba revolt in Judea. This was the last large-scale Jewish revolt against the Romans, and was suppressed with massive repercussions in Judea. Hundreds of thousands of Jews were killed. Hadrian renamed the province of Judea &quot;Provincia Syria Palaestina&quot;, after one of Judea&#x27;s most hated enemies. He constructed fortifications and walls, like the celebrated Hadrian&#x27;s Wall which separated Roman Britannia and the tribes of modern-day Scotland. Hadrian promoted culture, especially the Greek. He forbade torture and humanised the laws. His many building projects included aqueducts, baths, libraries and theatres; additionally, he travelled nearly every province in the Empire to review military and infrastructural conditions. Following Hadrian&#x27;s death in 138 AD, his successor Antoninus Pius built temples, theatres, and mausoleums, promoted the arts and sciences, and bestowed honours and financial rewards upon the teachers of rhetoric and philosophy. On becoming emperor, Antoninus made few initial changes, leaving intact as far as possible the arrangements instituted by his predecessor. Antoninus expanded Roman Britannia by invading what is now southern Scotland and building the Antonine Wall. He also continued Hadrian&#x27;s policy of humanising the laws. He died in 161 AD.

Marcus Aurelius, known as the Philosopher, was the last of the Five Good Emperors. He was a stoic philosopher and wrote the &quot;Meditations&quot;. He defeated barbarian tribes in the Marcomannic Wars as well as the Parthian Empire. His co-emperor, Lucius Verus, died in 169 AD, probably from the Antonine Plague, a pandemic that killed nearly five million people through the Empire in 165–180 AD.

From Nerva to Marcus Aurelius, the empire achieved an unprecedented status. The powerful influence of laws and manners had gradually cemented the union of the provinces. All the citizens enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth. The image of a free constitution was preserved with decent reverence. The Roman senate appeared to possess the sovereign authority, and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of government. Gibbon declared the rule of these &quot;Five Good Emperors&quot; the golden era of the Empire. During this time, Rome reached its greatest territorial extent.

Commodus, son of Marcus Aurelius, became emperor after his father&#x27;s death. He is not counted as one of the Five Good Emperors, due to his direct kinship with the latter emperor; in addition, he was militarily passive. Cassius Dio identifies his reign as the beginning of Roman decadence: &quot;(Rome has transformed) from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust.&quot;

==== Severan dynasty ====

Commodus was killed by a conspiracy involving Quintus Aemilius Laetus and his wife Marcia in late 192 AD. The following year is known as the Year of the Five Emperors, during which Helvius Pertinax, Didius Julianus, Pescennius Niger, Clodius Albinus and Septimius Severus held the imperial dignity. Pertinax, a member of the senate who had been one of Marcus Aurelius&#x27;s right-hand men, was the choice of Laetus, and he ruled vigorously and judiciously. Laetus soon became jealous and instigated Pertinax&#x27;s murder by the Praetorian Guard, who then auctioned the empire to the highest bidder, Didius Julianus, for 25,000 sesterces per man. The people of Rome were appalled and appealed to the frontier legions to save them. The legions of three frontier provinces—Britannia, Pannonia Superior, and Syria—resented being excluded from the &quot;donative&quot; and replied by declaring their individual generals to be emperor. Lucius Septimius Severus Geta, the Pannonian commander, bribed the opposing forces, pardoned the Praetorian Guards and installed himself as emperor. He and his successors governed with the legions&#x27; support. The changes on coinage and military expenditures were the root of the financial crisis that marked the Crisis of the Third Century.
Severus was enthroned after invading Rome and having Didius Julianus killed. Severus attempted to revive totalitarianism and, addressing the Roman people and Senate, praised the severity and cruelty of Marius and Sulla, which worried the senators. When Parthia invaded Roman territory, Severus successfully waged war against that country. Notwithstanding this military success, Severus failed in invading Hatra, a rich Arabian city. Severus killed his legate, who was gaining respect from the legions; and his soldiers fell victim to famine. After this disastrous campaign, he withdrew. Severus also intended to vanquish the whole of Britannia. To achieve this, he waged war against the Caledonians. However, he became ill and died in 211 AD.
His sons Caracalla and Geta were made emperors. Caracalla had his brother, a youth, assassinated in his mother&#x27;s arms, and may have murdered 20,000 of Geta&#x27;s followers. Like his father, Caracalla was warlike. He continued Severus&#x27; policy and gained respect from the legions. Knowing that the citizens of Alexandria disliked him and were denigrating his character, Caracalla served a banquet for its notable citizens, after which his soldiers killed all the guests. From the security of the temple of Sarapis, he then directed an indiscriminate slaughter of Alexandria&#x27;s people. In 212, he issued the Edict of Caracalla, giving full Roman citizenship to all free men living in the Empire, with the exception of the &quot;dediticii&quot;, people who had become subject to Rome through surrender in war, and freed slaves.

Mary Beard points to the edict as a fundamental turning point, after which &quot;Rome&quot; was &quot;effectively a new state masquerading under an old name&quot;.

Macrinus conspired to have Caracalla assassinated by one of his soldiers during a pilgrimage to the Temple of the Moon in Carrhae, in 217 AD. Macrinus assumed power, but soon removed himself from Rome to the east and Antioch. His brief reign ended in 218, when the youngster Bassianus, high priest of the temple of the Sun at Emesa, and supposedly illegitimate son of Caracalla, was declared Emperor by the disaffected soldiers of Macrinus. He adopted the name of Antoninus but history has named him after his Sun god Elagabalus, represented on Earth in the form of a large black stone. An incompetent and lascivious ruler, Elagabalus adopted his cousin Severus Alexander, as Caesar, but subsequently grew jealous and attempted to assassinate him. However, the Praetorian guard preferred Alexander, murdered Elagabalus, dragged his mutilated corpse through the streets of Rome, and threw it into the Tiber. Severus Alexander then succeeded him. Alexander waged war against many foes, including the revitalised Persia and also the Germanic peoples, who invaded Gaul. His losses generated dissatisfaction among his soldiers, and some of them murdered him during his Germanic campaign in 235 AD.

==== Crisis of the Third Century ====

A disastrous scenario emerged after the death of Alexander Severus: the Roman state was plagued by civil wars, external invasions, political chaos, pandemics and economic depression. The old Roman values had fallen, and Mithraism and Christianity had begun to spread through the populace. Emperors were no longer men linked with nobility; they usually were born in lower-classes of distant parts of the Empire. These men rose to prominence through military ranks, and became emperors through civil wars.

There were 26 emperors in a 49-year period, a signal of political instability. Maximinus Thrax was the first ruler of that time, governing for just three years. Others ruled just for a few months, like Gordian I, Gordian II, Balbinus and Hostilian. The population and the frontiers were abandoned, since the emperors were mostly concerned with defeating rivals and establishing their power. The economy also suffered: massive military expenditures from the Severi caused a devaluation of Roman coins. Hyperinflation came at this time as well. The Plague of Cyprian broke out in 250 and killed a huge portion of the population. In 260 AD, the provinces of Syria Palaestina, Asia Minor and Egypt separated from the rest of the Roman state to form the Palmyrene Empire, ruled by Queen Zenobia and centered on Palmyra. In that same year the Gallic Empire was created by Postumus, retaining Britannia and Gaul. These countries separated from Rome after the capture of emperor Valerian by the Sassanids of Persia, the first Roman ruler to be captured by his enemies; it was a humiliating fact for the Romans. The crisis began to recede during the reigns of Claudius Gothicus (268–270), who defeated the Gothic invaders, and Aurelian (271–275), who reconquered both the Gallic and Palmyrene Empires. The crisis was overcome during the reign of Diocletian.

=== Empire – The Tetrarchy ===
==== Diocletian ====

In 284 AD, Diocletian was hailed as Imperator by the eastern army. Diocletian healed the empire from the crisis, by political and economic shifts. A new form of government was established: the Tetrarchy. The Empire was divided among four emperors, two in the West and two in the East. The first tetrarchs were Diocletian (in the East), Maximian (in the West), and two junior emperors, Galerius (in the East) and Flavius Constantius (in the West). To adjust the economy, Diocletian made several tax reforms.

Diocletian expelled the Persians who plundered Syria and conquered some barbarian tribes with Maximian. He adopted many behaviours of Eastern monarchs. Anyone in the presence of the emperor had now to prostrate himself—a common act in the East, but never practised in Rome before. Diocletian did not use a disguised form of Republic, as the other emperors since Augustus had done. Between 290 and 330, half a dozen new capitals had been established by the members of the Tetrarchy, officially or not: Antioch, Nicomedia, Thessalonike, Sirmium, Milan, and Trier. Diocletian was also responsible for a significant Christian persecution. In 303 he and Galerius started the persecution and ordered the destruction of all the Christian churches and scripts and forbade Christian worship. Diocletian abdicated in 305 AD together with Maximian, thus, he was the first Roman emperor to resign. His reign ended the traditional form of imperial rule, the Principate (from princeps) and started the Tetrarchy.
==== Constantine and Christianity ====
Constantine assumed the empire as a tetrarch in 306. He conducted many wars against the other tetrarchs. Firstly he defeated Maxentius in 312. In 313, he issued the Edict of Milan, which granted liberty for Christians to profess their religion. Constantine was converted to Christianity, enforcing the Christian faith. He began the Christianization of the Empire and of Europe—a process concluded by the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages. He was defeated by the Franks and the Alamanni during 306–308. In 324 he defeated another tetrarch, Licinius, and controlled all the empire, as it was before Diocletian. To celebrate his victories and Christianity&#x27;s relevance, he rebuilt Byzantium and renamed it Nova Roma (&quot;New Rome&quot;); but the city soon gained the informal name of Constantinople (&quot;City of Constantine&quot;).

The reign of Julian, who under the influence of his adviser Mardonius attempted to restore Classical Roman and Hellenistic religion, only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. Constantinople served as a new capital for the Empire. In fact, Rome had lost its central importance since the Crisis of the Third Century—Mediolanum was the western capital from 286 to 330, until the reign of Honorius, when Ravenna was made capital, in the 5th century. Constantine&#x27;s administrative and monetary reforms, that reunited the Empire under one emperor, and rebuilt the city of Byzantium, as Constantinopolis Nova Roma, changed the high period of the ancient world.

=== Fall of the Western Roman Empire ===

In the late 4th and 5th centuries the Western Empire entered a critical stage which terminated with the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Under the last emperors of the Constantinian dynasty and the Valentinianic dynasty, Rome lost decisive battles against the Sasanian Empire and Germanic barbarians: in 363, emperor Julian the Apostate was killed in the Battle of Samarra, against the Persians and the Battle of Adrianople cost the life of emperor Valens (364–378); the victorious Goths were never expelled from the Empire nor assimilated. The next emperor, Theodosius I (379–395), gave even more force to the Christian faith, and after his death, the Empire was divided into the Eastern Roman Empire, ruled by Arcadius and the Western Roman Empire, commanded by Honorius, both of which were Theodosius&#x27; sons.
The situation became more critical in 408, after the death of Stilicho, a general who tried to reunite the Empire and repel barbarian invasion in the early years of the 5th century. The professional field army collapsed. In 410, the Theodosian dynasty saw the Visigoths sack Rome. During the 5th century, the Western Empire experienced a significant reduction of its territory. The Vandals conquered North Africa, the Visigoths claimed the southern part of Gaul, Gallaecia was taken by the Suebi, Britannia was abandoned by the central government, and the Empire suffered further from the invasions of Attila, chief of the Huns. General Orestes refused to meet the demands of the barbarian &quot;allies&quot; who now formed the army, and tried to expel them from Italy. Unhappy with this, their chieftain Odoacer defeated and killed Orestes, invaded Ravenna and dethroned Romulus Augustus, son of Orestes. This event of 476, usually marks the end of Classical antiquity and beginning of the Middle Ages. The Roman noble and former emperor Julius Nepos continued to rule as emperor from Dalmatia even after the deposition of Romulus Augustus until his death in 480. Some historians consider him to be the last emperor of the Western Empire instead of Romulus Augustus.

After 1200 years of independence and nearly 700 years as a great power, the rule of Rome in the West ended. Various reasons for Rome&#x27;s fall have been proposed, including loss of Republicanism, moral decay, military tyranny, class war, slavery, economic stagnation, environmental change, disease, the decline of the Roman race, as well as the inevitable ebb and flow that all civilisations experience.
The Eastern Empire survived for almost 1000 years after the fall of its Western counterpart and became the most stable Christian realm during the Middle Ages. During the 6th century, Justinian reconquered the Italian peninsula from the Ostrogoths, North Africa from the Vandals, and southern Hispania from the Visigoths. But within a few years of Justinian&#x27;s death, Byzantine possessions in Italy were greatly reduced by the Lombards who settled in the peninsula. In the east, partially due to the weakening effect of the Plague of Justinian as well as a series of mutually destructive wars against the Persian Sassanian Empire, the Byzantines were threatened by the rise of Islam. Its followers rapidly brought about the conquest of the Levant, the conquest of North Africa and the conquest of Egypt during the Arab–Byzantine wars, and soon presented a direct threat to Constantinople. In the following century, the Arabs captured southern Italy and Sicily. In the west, Slavic populations penetrated deep into the Balkans.

The Byzantine Romans, however, managed to stop further Islamic expansion into their lands during the 8th century and, beginning in the 9th century, reclaimed parts of the conquered lands. In 1000 AD, the Eastern Empire was at its height: Basil II reconquered Bulgaria and Armenia, and culture and trade flourished. However, soon after, this expansion was abruptly stopped in 1071 with the Byzantine defeat in the Battle of Manzikert. The aftermath of this battle sent the empire into a protracted period of decline. Two decades of internal strife and Turkic invasions ultimately led Emperor Alexios I Komnenos to send a call for help to the Western European kingdoms in 1095. The West responded with the Crusades, eventually resulting in the Sack of Constantinople by participants of the Fourth Crusade. The conquest of Constantinople in 1204 fragmented what remained of the Empire into successor states; the ultimate victor was the Empire of Nicaea. After the recapture of Constantinople by Imperial forces, the Empire was little more than a Greek state confined to the Aegean coast. The Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire collapsed when Mehmed the Conqueror conquered Constantinople on 29 May 1453.

== Society ==

The imperial city of Rome was the largest urban center in the empire, with a population variously estimated from 450,000 to close to one million. Around 20 per cent of the population under jurisdiction of ancient Rome (25–40%, depending on the standards used, in Roman Italy) lived in innumerable urban centers, with population of 10,000 and more and several military settlements, a very high rate of urbanisation by pre-industrial standards. Most of those centers had a forum, temples, and other buildings similar to Rome&#x27;s. The average life expectancy in the Middle Empire was about 26–28 years.

=== Law ===

The roots of the legal principles and practices of the ancient Romans may be traced to the Law of the Twelve Tables promulgated in 449 BC and to the codification of law issued by order of Emperor Justinian I around 530 AD (see ). Roman law as preserved in Justinian&#x27;s codes continued into the Byzantine Roman Empire, and formed the basis of similar codifications in continental Western Europe. Roman law continued, in a broader sense, to be applied throughout most of Europe until the end of the 17th century.

The major divisions of the law of ancient Rome, as contained within the Justinian and Theodosian law codes, consisted of , , and . The (&#x27;citizen law&#x27;) was the body of common laws that applied to Roman citizens. The ( ) were the people who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens. The (&#x27;law of nations&#x27;) was the body of common laws that applied to foreigners, and their dealings with Roman citizens. The ( ) were the people who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens and foreigners. encompassed natural law, the body of laws that were considered common to all beings.

=== Class structure ===
Roman society is largely viewed as hierarchical, with slaves () at the bottom, freedmen () above them, and free-born citizens () at the top. Free citizens were subdivided by class. The broadest, and earliest, division was between the patricians, who could trace their ancestry to one of the 100 patriarchs at the founding of the city, and the plebeians, who could not. This became less important in the later Republic, as some plebeian families became wealthy and entered politics, and some patrician families fell economically. Anyone, patrician or plebeian, who could count a consul as his ancestor was a noble (); a man who was the first of his family to hold the consulship, such as Marius or Cicero, was known as a (&#x27;new man&#x27;) and ennobled his descendants. Patrician ancestry, however, still conferred considerable prestige, and many religious offices remained restricted to patricians.

A class division originally based on military service became more important. Membership of these classes was determined periodically by the censors, according to property. The wealthiest were the Senatorial class, who dominated politics and command of the army. Next came the equestrians (, sometimes translated &quot;knights&quot;), originally those who could afford a warhorse, and who formed a powerful mercantile class. Several further classes, originally based on the military equipment their members could afford, followed, with the , citizens who had no property other than their children, at the bottom. Before the reforms of Marius they were ineligible for military service and are often described as being just above freed slaves in wealth and prestige.

Voting power in the Republic depended on class. Citizens were enrolled in voting &quot;tribes&quot;, but the tribes of the richer classes had fewer members than the poorer ones, all the being enrolled in a single tribe. Voting was done in class order, from top down, and stopped as soon as most of the tribes had been reached, so the poorer classes were often unable to cast their votes.

Women in ancient Rome shared some basic rights with their male counterparts, but were not fully regarded as citizens and were thus not allowed to vote or take part in politics. At the same time the limited rights of women were gradually expanded (due to emancipation) and women reached freedom from , gained property rights and even had more juridical rights than their husbands, but still no voting rights, and were absent from politics.

Allied foreign cities were often given the Latin Rights, an intermediary level between full citizens and foreigners (), which gave their citizens rights under Roman law and allowed their leading magistrates to become full Roman citizens. While there were varying degrees of Latin rights, the main division was between those (&#x27;with vote&#x27;; enrolled in a Roman tribe and able to take part in the ) and (&#x27;without vote&#x27;; could not take part in Roman politics). Most of Rome&#x27;s Italian allies were given full citizenship after the Social War of 91–88 BC, and full Roman citizenship was extended to all free-born men in the Empire by Caracalla in 212, with the exception of the , people who had become subject to Rome through surrender in war, and freed slaves.

=== Education ===

In the early Republic, there were no public schools, so boys were taught to read and write by their parents, or by educated slaves, called , usually of Greek origin. The primary aim of education during this period was to train young men in agriculture, warfare, Roman traditions, and public affairs. Young boys learned much about civic life by accompanying their fathers to religious and political functions, including the Senate for the sons of nobles. The sons of nobles were apprenticed to a prominent political figure at the age of 16, and campaigned with the army from the age of 17. Educational practices were modified after the conquest of the Hellenistic kingdoms in the 3rd century BC and the resulting Greek influence, although Roman educational practices were still much different from Greek ones. If their parents could afford it, boys and some girls at the age of 7 were sent to a private school outside the home called a , where a teacher (called a or a , and often of Greek origin) taught them basic reading, writing, arithmetic, and sometimes Greek, until the age of 11.

Beginning at age 12, students went to secondary schools, where the teacher (now called a ) taught them about Greek and Roman literature. At the age of 16, some students went on to rhetoric school (where the teacher, usually Greek, was called a ). Education at this level prepared students for legal careers, and required that the students memorise the laws of Rome.

=== Government ===
Initially, Rome was ruled by kings, who were elected from each of Rome&#x27;s major tribes in turn. The exact nature of the king&#x27;s power is uncertain. He may have held near-absolute power, or may have merely been the chief executive of the Senate and the people. In military matters, the king&#x27;s authority () was likely absolute. He was also the head of the state religion. In addition to the authority of the King, there were three administrative assemblies: the Senate, which acted as an advisory body for the King; the Comitia Curiata, which could endorse and ratify laws suggested by the King; and the Comitia Calata, which was an assembly of the priestly college that could assemble the people to bear witness to certain acts, hear proclamations, and declare the feast and holiday schedule for the next month.
The class struggles of the Roman Republic resulted in an unusual mixture of democracy and oligarchy. The word republic comes from the Latin , which literally translates to &#x27;public business&#x27;. Roman laws traditionally could only be passed by a vote of the Popular assembly (Comitia Tributa). Likewise, candidates for public positions had to run for election by the people. However, the Roman Senate represented an oligarchic institution, which acted as an advisory body.

In the Republic, the Senate held actual authority (), but no real legislative power; it was technically only an advisory council. However, as the Senators were individually very influential, it was difficult to accomplish anything against the collective will of the Senate. New senators were chosen from among the most accomplished patricians by censors (), who could also remove a senator from his office if he was found &quot;morally corrupt&quot;. Later, under the reforms of the dictator Sulla, quaestors were made automatic members of the Senate, though most of his reforms did not survive.

The Republic had no fixed bureaucracy, and collected taxes through the practice of tax farming. Government positions such as quaestor, aedile, or praefect were funded by the office-holder. To prevent any citizen from gaining too much power, new magistrates were elected annually and had to share power with a colleague. For example, under normal conditions, the highest authority was held by two consuls. In an emergency, a temporary dictator could be appointed. Throughout the Republic, the administrative system was revised several times to comply with new demands. In the end, it proved inefficient for controlling the ever-expanding dominion of Rome, contributing to the establishment of the Roman Empire.

In the early Empire, the pretense of a republican form of government was maintained. The Roman emperor was portrayed as only a , or &#x27;first citizen&#x27;, and the Senate gained legislative power and all legal authority previously held by the popular assemblies. However, the rule of the Emperors became increasingly autocratic, and the Senate was reduced to an advisory body appointed by the Emperor. The Empire did not inherit a set bureaucracy from the Republic, since the Republic did not have any permanent governmental structures apart from the Senate. The Emperor appointed assistants and advisers, but the state lacked many institutions, such as a centrally planned budget. Some historians have cited this as a significant reason for the decline of the Roman Empire.

=== Military ===


The early Roman army () was, like those of other contemporary city-states influenced by Greek civilisation, a citizen that practised hoplite tactics. It was small and organised in five classes (in parallel to the , the body of citizens organised politically), with three providing hoplites and two providing light infantry. The early Roman army was tactically limited and its stance during this period was essentially defensive.

By the 3rd century BC, the Romans abandoned the hoplite formation in favour of a more flexible system in which smaller groups of 120 (or sometimes 60) men called &#x27; could manoeuvre more independently on the battlefield. Thirty maniples arranged in three lines with supporting troops constituted a legion, totalling between 4,000 and 5,000 men. The early Republican legion consisted of five sections: manipular heavy infantry (, and ), a force of light infantry (), and the cavalry (). With the new organisation came a new orientation toward the offensive and a much more aggressive posture toward adjoining city-states.

Until the late Republican period, the typical legionary was a property-owning citizen farmer from a rural area (an ) who served for particular (often annual) campaigns, and who supplied his own equipment. After 200 BC, economic conditions in rural areas deteriorated as manpower needs increased, so that the property qualifications for compulsory service were gradually reduced. Beginning in the 3rd century BC, legionaries were paid a stipend. By the time of Augustus, the ideal of the citizen-soldier had been abandoned and the legions had become fully professional. At the end of the Civil War, Augustus reorganised Roman military forces, discharging soldiers and disbanding legions. He retained 28 legions, distributed through the provinces of the Empire.

During the Principate, the tactical organisation of the Army continued to evolve. The remained independent cohorts, and legionary troops often operated as groups of cohorts rather than as full legions. A new and versatile type of unit, the , combined cavalry and legionaries in a single formation. They could be stationed at garrisons or outposts and could fight on their own as balanced small forces or combine with similar units as a larger, legion-sized force. This increase in organizational flexibility helped ensure the long-term success of Roman military forces. The Emperor Gallienus (253–268 AD) began a reorganisation that created the last military structure of the late Empire. Withdrawing some legionaries from the fixed bases on the border, Gallienus created mobile forces (the , or field armies) and stationed them behind and at some distance from the borders as a strategic reserve. The border troops () stationed at fixed bases continued to be the first line of defence. The basic units of the field army were regimental; or for infantry and for cavalry. Nominal strengths may have been 1,200 men for infantry regiments and 600 for cavalry, but actual troop levels could have been much lower—800 infantry and 400 cavalry. Many infantry and cavalry regiments operated in pairs under the command of a . Field armies included regiments recruited from allied tribes and known as . By 400 AD, regiments had become permanently established units of the Roman army, paid and equipped by the Empire, led by a Roman tribune and used just as Roman units were used. The Empire also used groups of barbarians to fight along with the legions as allies without integration into the field armies, under overall command of a Roman general, but led by their own officers.

Military leadership evolved over the course of the history of Rome. Under the monarchy, the hoplite armies were led by the kings. During the early and middle Roman Republic, military forces were under the command of one of the two elected consuls for the year. During the later Republic, members of the Roman Senatorial elite, as part of the normal sequence of elected public offices known as the , would have served first as (often posted as deputies to field commanders), then as . Following the end of a term as praetor or consul, a Senator might be appointed by the Senate as a or (depending on the highest office held before) to govern a foreign province. Under Augustus, whose most important political priority was to place the military under a permanent and unitary command, the Emperor was the legal commander of each legion but exercised that command through a (legate) he appointed from the Senatorial elite. In a province with a single legion, the legate commanded the legion () and served as provincial governor, while in a province with more than one legion, each legion was commanded by a legate and the legates were commanded by the provincial governor (also a legate but of higher rank).

During the later stages of the Imperial period (beginning perhaps with Diocletian), the Augustan model was abandoned. Provincial governors were stripped of military authority, and command of the armies in a group of provinces was given to generals () appointed by the Emperor. These were no longer members of the Roman elite but men who came up through the ranks and had seen much practical soldiering. With increasing frequency, these men attempted (sometimes successfully) to usurp the positions of the Emperors. Decreased resources, increasing political chaos and civil war eventually left the Western Empire vulnerable to attack and takeover by neighbouring barbarian peoples.

==== Roman navy ====
Less is known about the Roman navy than the Roman army. Prior to the middle of the 3rd century BC, officials known as commanded a fleet of twenty ships used mainly to control piracy. This fleet was given up in 278 AD and replaced by allied forces. The First Punic War required that Rome build large fleets, and it did so largely with the assistance of and financing from allies. This reliance on allies continued to the end of the Roman Republic. The quinquereme was the main warship on both sides of the Punic Wars and remained the mainstay of Roman naval forces until replaced by the time of Caesar Augustus by lighter and more manoeuvrable vessels.

As compared with a trireme, the quinquereme permitted the use of a mix of experienced and inexperienced crewmen (an advantage for a primarily land-based power), and its lesser manoeuvrability permitted the Romans to adopt and perfect boarding tactics using a troop of about 40 marines in lieu of the ram. Ships were commanded by a , a rank equal to a centurion, who was usually not a citizen. Potter suggests that because the fleet was dominated by non-Romans, the navy was considered non-Roman and allowed to atrophy in times of peace.

Information suggests that by the time of the late Empire (350 AD), the Roman navy comprised several fleets including warships and merchant vessels for transportation and supply. Warships were oared sailing galleys with three to five banks of oarsmen. Fleet bases included such ports as Ravenna, Arles, Aquilea, Misenum and the mouth of the Somme River in the West and Alexandria and Rhodes in the East. Flotillas of small river craft () were part of the (border troops) during this period, based at fortified river harbours along the Rhine and the Danube. That prominent generals commanded both armies and fleets suggests that naval forces were treated as auxiliaries to the army and not as an independent service. The details of command structure and fleet strengths during this period are not well known, although fleets were commanded by prefects.

=== Economy ===
Ancient Rome commanded a vast area of land, with tremendous natural and human resources. As such, Rome&#x27;s economy remained focused on farming and trade. Agricultural free trade changed the Italian landscape, and by the 1st century BC, vast grape and olive estates had supplanted the yeoman farmers, who were unable to match the imported grain price. The annexation of Egypt, Sicily and Tunisia in North Africa provided a continuous supply of grains. In turn, olive oil and wine were Italy&#x27;s main exports. Two-tier crop rotation was practised, but farm productivity was low.

Industrial and manufacturing activities were small. The largest such activities were the mining and quarrying of stones, which provided basic construction materials for the buildings of that period. In manufacturing, production was on a relatively small scale, and generally consisted of workshops and small factories that employed at most dozens of workers. However, some brick factories employed hundreds of workers.

The economy of the early Republic was largely based on smallholding and paid labour. However, foreign wars and conquests made slaves increasingly cheap and plentiful, and by the late Republic, the economy was largely dependent on slave labour for both skilled and unskilled work. Slaves are estimated to have constituted around 20% of the Roman Empire&#x27;s population at this time and 40% in the city of Rome. Only in the Roman Empire, when the conquests stopped and the prices of slaves increased, did hired labour become more economical than slave ownership.
Although barter was used in ancient Rome, and often used in tax collection, Rome had a very developed coinage system, with brass, bronze, and precious metal coins in circulation throughout the Empire and beyond—some have even been discovered in India. Before the 3rd century BC, copper was traded by weight, measured in unmarked lumps, across central Italy. The original copper coins () had a face value of one Roman pound of copper, but weighed less. Thus, Roman money&#x27;s utility as a unit of exchange consistently exceeded its intrinsic value as metal. After Nero began debasing the silver denarius, its legal value was an estimated one-third greater than its intrinsic value.

Horses were expensive and other pack animals were slower. Mass trade on the Roman roads connected military posts, where Roman markets were centered. These roads were designed for wheels. As a result, there was transport of commodities between Roman regions, but increased with the rise of Roman maritime trade in the 2nd century BC. During that period, a trading vessel took less than a month to complete a trip from Gades to Alexandria via Ostia, spanning the entire length of the Mediterranean. Transport by sea was around 60 times cheaper than by land, so the volume for such trips was much larger.

Some economists consider the Roman Empire a market economy, similar in its degree of capitalistic practices to the 17th-century Netherlands and 18th-century England.

=== Family ===


The basic units of Roman society were households and families. Groups of households connected through the male line formed a family (), based on blood ties, a common ancestry or adoption. During the Republic, some powerful families, or , came to dominate political life. Families were headed by their oldest male citizen, the (father of the family), who held lawful authority (, &#x27;father&#x27;s power&#x27;) over wives, sons, daughters, and slaves of the household, and the family&#x27;s wealth.

The extreme expressions of this power—the selling or killing of family members for moral or civil offences, including simple disobedience—were very rarely exercised, and were forbidden in the Imperial era. A had moral and legal duties towards all family members. Even the most despotic was expected to consult senior members of his household and over matters that affected the family&#x27;s well-being and reputation. Traditionally, such matters were regarded as outside the purview of the state and its magistrates; under the emperors, they were increasingly subject to state interference and legislation.

Once accepted into their birth family by their fathers, children were potential heirs. They could not be lawfully given away, or sold into slavery. If parents were unable to care for their child, or if its paternity was in doubt, they could resort to infant exposure (Boswell translates this as being &quot;offered&quot; up to care by the gods or strangers). If a deformed or sickly newborn was patently &quot;unfit to live&quot;, killing it was a duty of the . A citizen father who exposed a healthy freeborn child was not punished, but automatically lost his over that child. Abandoned children were sometimes adopted; some would have been sold into slavery. Slavery was near-ubiquitous and almost universally accepted. In the early Republic, citizens in debt were allowed to sell their labour, and perhaps their sons, to their debtor in a limited form of slavery called but this was abolished in the middle Republic. Freedom was considered a natural and proper state for citizens; slaves could be lawfully freed, with consent and support of their owners, and still serve their owners&#x27; family and financial interests, as freedmen or freed women. This was the basis of the client-patron relationship, one of the most important features of Rome&#x27;s economy and society.

In law, a held over his adult sons with their own households. This could give rise to legal anomalies, such as adult sons also having the status of minors. No man could be considered a , nor could he truly hold property under law, while his own father lived. During Rome&#x27;s early history, married daughters came under the control () of their husbands&#x27; . By the late Republic, most married women retained lawful connection to their birth family, though any children from the marriage belonged to her husband&#x27;s family. The mother or an elderly relative often raised both boys and girls. Roman moralists held that marriage and child-raising fulfilled a basic duty to family, , and the state. Multiple remarriages were not uncommon. Fathers usually began seeking husbands for their daughters when these reached an age between twelve and fourteen, but most commoner-class women stayed single until their twenties, and in general seem to have been far more independent than wives of the elite. Divorce required the consent of one party, along with the return of any dowry. Both parents had power over their children during their minority and adulthood, but husbands had much less control over their wives.

Roman citizen women held a restricted form of citizenship; they could not vote but were protected by law. They ran families, could own and run businesses, own and cultivate land, write their own wills, and plead in court on their own behalf, or on behalf of others, all under dispensation of the courts and the nominal supervision of a senior male relative. Throughout the late Republican and Imperial eras, a declining birthrate among the elite, and a corresponding increase among commoners was cause of concern for many ; Augustus tried to address this through state intervention, offering rewards to any woman who gave birth to three or more children, and penalising the childless. The latter was much resented, and the former had seemingly negligible results. Aristocratic women seem to have been increasingly disinclined to childbearing.

=== Time and dates ===

Roman hours were counted ordinally from dawn to dawn. Thus, if sunrise was at 6 am, then 6 to 7 am was called the &#x27;first hour&#x27;. Midday was called , and it is from this word that the terms &quot;am&quot; ( and &quot;pm&quot; () stem. The English word &quot;noon&quot; comes from (&#x27;ninth (hour)&#x27;), which referred to 3 pm in ancient Rome. The Romans had clocks ), which included giant public sundials () and water clocks ().

The ancient Roman week originally had eight days, which were identified by letters A to H, with the eighth day being the , or market day, a kind of weekend when farmers sold their produce on the streets. The seven-day week, introduced from the East during the early Empire, was officially adopted during the reign of Constantine. Romans named week days after celestial bodies from at least the 1st century AD.

The Roman year originally had ten months from Martius (March) to December, with the winter period not included in the calendar. The first four months were named after gods (Martius, Aprilis, Maius, Junius) and the others were numbered (Quintilis, Sextilis, September, October, November, and December). Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome (716–673 BC), is said to have introduced the months of January and February, both also named after gods, beginning the 12-month calendar still in use today. In 44 BC, the month Quintilis was renamed to Julius (July) after Julius Caesar and in 8 BC, Sextilis was renamed to Augustus (August) after Augustus Caesar.

The Romans had several ways of tracking years. One widespread way was the consular dating, which identified years by the two consuls who ruled each year. Another way, introduced in the late 3rd century AD, was counting years from the , a 15-year period based on the announcement of the delivery of food and other goods to the government. Another way, less popular but more similar to present day, was , which counted years from the mythical foundation of Rome in 753 BC.

== Culture ==
Life in ancient Rome revolved around the city of Rome, located on seven hills. The city had a vast number of monumental structures like the Colosseum, the Trajan&#x27;s Forum and the Pantheon. It had theatres, gymnasiums, marketplaces, functional sewers, bath complexes complete with libraries and shops, and fountains with fresh drinking water supplied by hundreds of miles of aqueducts. Throughout the territory under the control of ancient Rome, residential architecture ranged from modest houses to country villas.

In Rome, there were imperial residences on Palatine Hill. The low plebeian and middle equestrian classes lived in the city center, packed into apartments, or insulae, which were almost like modern ghettos. These areas, often built by upper class property owners to rent, were often centred upon collegia or taberna. These people, provided with a free supply of grain, and entertained by gladiatorial games, were enrolled as clients of patrons among the upper class patricians, whose assistance they sought and whose interests they upheld.

=== Language ===

The native language of the Romans was Latin, an Italic language the grammar of which relies little on word order, conveying meaning through a system of affixes attached to word stems. Its alphabet was based on the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn based on the Greek alphabet. Although surviving Latin literature consists almost entirely of Classical Latin, an artificial and highly stylised and polished literary language from the 1st century BC, the spoken language of the Roman Empire was Vulgar Latin, which significantly differed from Classical Latin in grammar and vocabulary, and eventually in pronunciation. Speakers of Latin could understand both until the 7th century when spoken Latin began to diverge so much that &#x27;Classical&#x27; or &#x27;Good Latin&#x27; had to be learned as a second language.

While Latin remained the main written language of the Roman Empire, Greek came to be the language spoken by the well-educated elite, as most of the literature studied by Romans was written in Greek. Most of the emperors were bilingual but had a preference for Latin in the public sphere for political reasons, a practice that first started during the Punic wars. In the eastern part of the Roman Empire (and later the Eastern Roman Empire), Latin was never able to replace Greek, a legacy of the Hellenistic period. Justinian would be the last emperor to use Latin in government and marks when Greek officially took over. The expansion of the Roman Empire spread Latin throughout Europe, and Vulgar Latin evolved into many distinct Romance languages.

=== Religion ===

Archaic Roman religion, at least concerning the gods, was made up not of written narratives, but rather of complex interrelations between gods and humans. Unlike in Greek mythology, the gods were not personified, but were vaguely defined sacred spirits called . Romans also believed that every person, place or thing had its own , or divine soul. During the Roman Republic, Roman religion was organised under a strict system of priestly offices, which were held by men of senatorial rank. The College of Pontifices was uppermost body in this hierarchy, and its chief priest, the , was the head of the state religion. Flamens took care of the cults of various gods, while augurs were trusted with taking the auspices. The sacred king took on the religious responsibilities of the deposed kings. In the Roman Empire, deceased emperors who had ruled well were deified by their successors and the Senate. and the formalised imperial cult became increasingly prominent.

As contact with the Greeks increased, the old Roman gods became increasingly associated with Greek gods. Under the Empire, the Romans absorbed the mythologies of their conquered subjects, often leading to situations in which the temples and priests of traditional Italian deities existed side by side with those of foreign gods.

Beginning with Emperor Nero in the 1st century AD, Roman official policy towards Christianity was negative, and at some point, being a Christian could be punishable by death. Under Emperor Diocletian, the persecution of Christians reached its peak. However, it became an officially supported religion in the Roman state under Diocletian&#x27;s successor, Constantine I, with the signing of the Edict of Milan in 313, and quickly became dominant. All religions except Christianity were prohibited in 391 AD by an edict of Emperor Theodosius I.

=== Ethics and morality ===
Like many ancient cultures, concepts of ethics and morality, while sharing some commonalities with modern society, differed greatly in several important ways. Because ancient civilisations like Rome were under constant threat of attack from marauding tribes, their culture was necessarily militaristic with martial skills being a prized attribute. Whereas modern societies consider compassion a virtue, Roman society considered compassion a vice, a moral defect. Indeed, one of the primary purposes of the gladiatorial games was to inoculate Roman citizens from this weakness. Romans instead prized virtues such as courage and conviction (), a sense of duty to one&#x27;s people, moderation and avoiding excess (), forgiveness and understanding (), fairness (), and loyalty ().

Roman society had well-established and restrictive norms related to sexuality, though as with many societies, the lion&#x27;s share of the responsibilities fell on women. Women were generally expected to be monogamous having only a single husband during their life (), though this was much less regarded by the elite, especially under the empire. Women were expected to be modest in public avoiding any provocative appearance and to demonstrate absolute fidelity to their husbands (). Indeed, wearing a veil was a common expectation to preserve modesty. Sex outside of marriage was generally frowned upon for men and women and indeed was made illegal during the imperial period. Nevertheless, prostitution was an accepted and regulated practice.

Public demonstrations of death, violence, and brutality were used as a source of entertainment in Roman communities; however it was also a way to maintain social order, demonstrate power, and signify communal unity.

=== Art, music and literature ===


Roman painting styles show Greek influences, and surviving examples are primarily frescoes used to adorn the walls and ceilings of country villas, though Roman literature includes mentions of paintings on wood, ivory, and other materials. Several examples of Roman painting have been found at Pompeii, and from these art historians divide the history of Roman painting into four periods.

The first style of Roman painting was practised from the early 2nd century BC to the early- or mid-1st century BC. It was mainly composed of imitations of marble and masonry, though sometimes including depictions of mythological characters.
The second style began during the early 1st century BC and attempted to depict realistically three-dimensional architectural features and landscapes. The third style occurred during the reign of Augustus (27 BC – 14 AD), and rejected the realism of the second style in favour of simple ornamentation. A small architectural scene, landscape, or abstract design was placed in the center with a monochrome background. The fourth style, which began in the 1st century AD, depicted scenes from mythology, while retaining architectural details and abstract patterns.

Portrait sculpture used youthful and classical proportions, evolving later into a mixture of realism and idealism. During the Antonine and Severan periods, ornate hair and bearding, with deep cutting and drilling, became popular. Advancements were also made in relief sculptures, usually depicting Roman victories.

Roman music was largely based on Greek music, and played an important part in many aspects of Roman life. In the Roman military, musical instruments such as the (a long trumpet) or the were used to give various commands, while the (possibly a trumpet or horn) and the (probably an elongated J-shaped instrument), were used in ceremonial capacities. Music was used in the Roman amphitheatres between fights and in the , and in these settings is known to have featured the and the (a type of water organ). Most religious rituals featured musical performances. Some music historians believe that music was used at almost all public ceremonies.

The graffiti, brothels, paintings, and sculptures found in Pompeii and Herculaneum suggest that the Romans had a sex-saturated culture.

==== Literature and libraries ====
Latin literature was, from its start, influenced heavily by Greek authors. Some of the earliest extant works are of historical epics telling the early military history of Rome. As the Republic expanded, authors began to produce poetry, comedy, history, and tragedy.

Ancient Rome&#x27;s literary contributions are still recognised today and the works by ancient Roman authors were available in bookshops as well as in public and private libraries. Many scholars and statesmen of ancient Rome cultivated private libraries that were used both as demonstrations of knowledge and displays of wealth and power.

Although Julius Caesar had intended to establish public libraries to further establish Rome as a great cultural center like Athens and Alexandria, he died before this was accomplished. Caesar&#x27;s former lieutenant, Gaius Asinius Pollio, took up the project and opened the first public library in Rome in the Atrium Libertatis. Emperors Augustus, Tiberius, Vespasian, Domitian, and Trajan also founded or expanded public libraries in Rome during their reigns. These included the Ulpian Library in Trajan&#x27;s Forum and libraries in the Temple of Apollo Palatinus, the Temple of Peace in the Roman Forum, the Temple of Divus Augustus, which was dedicated to Minerva when it was  rebuilt under Emperor Domitian&#x27;s orders. By the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the city of Rome had more than two dozen public libraries. As the Roman Empire spread, public libraries were established in other major cities and cultural centers including Ephesos, Athens, and Timgad.

=== Cuisine ===
Ancient Roman cuisine changed over the long duration of this ancient civilisation. Dietary habits were affected by the influence of Greek culture, the political changes from Kingdom to Republic to Empire, and the Empire&#x27;s enormous expansion, which exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. In the beginning the differences between social classes were relatively small, but disparities evolved with the Empire&#x27;s growth. Men and women drank wine with their meals.

The ancient Roman diet included many items that are staples of modern Italian cooking. Pliny the Elder discussed more than 30 varieties of olive, 40 kinds of pear, figs (native and imported from Africa and the eastern provinces), and a wide variety of vegetables, including carrots (of different colours, but not orange) as well as celery, garlic, some flower bulbs, cabbage and other brassicas (such as kale and broccoli), lettuce, endive, onion, leek, asparagus, radishes, turnips, parsnips, beets, green peas, chard, cardoons, olives, and cucumber.

However, some foods now considered characteristic of modern Italian cuisine were not used. In particular, spinach and eggplant (aubergine) were introduced later from the Arab world, and tomatoes, potatoes, capsicum peppers, and maize (the modern source of polenta) only appeared in Europe following the discovery of the New World and the Columbian Exchange. The Romans knew of rice, but it was very rarely available to them. There were also few citrus fruits.

Butcher&#x27;s meat such as beef was an uncommon luxury. The most popular meat was pork, especially sausages. Fish was more common than meat, with a sophisticated aquaculture and large-scale industries devoted to oyster farming. The Romans also engaged in snail farming and oak grub farming. Some fish were greatly esteemed and fetched high prices, such as mullet raised in the fishery at Cosa, and &quot;elaborate means were invented to assure its freshness&quot;.

Traditionally, a breakfast called was served at dawn. At mid-day to early afternoon, Romans ate , the main meal of the day, and at nightfall a light supper called . With the increased importation of foreign foods, the grew larger in size and included a wider range of foods. Thus, it gradually shifted to the evening, while the was abandoned completely over the course of the years. The mid-day meal became a light meal to hold one over until .

=== Fashion ===

The toga, a common garment during the era of Julius Caesar, was gradually abandoned by all social classes of the Empire. At the early 4th century, the toga had become just a garment worn by senators in Senate and ceremonial events. At the 4th century, the toga was replaced by the (a garment similar to a poncho) as the everyday garment of the Romans, from the lower classes to the upper classes. Another garment that was popular among the Romans in the later years of the Western Roman Empire was the , which was mostly worn by philosophers and scholars in general. Due to external influences, mainly from the Germanic peoples, the Romans adopted tunics very similar to those used by the Germanic peoples with whom they interacted in the final years of the Western Empire, also adopted trousers and hats like the . During the Late Empire, the (a type of military clothing) was used only by the Emperor of Rome (since the reign of Augustus, the first emperor) while the dalmatic (also used by the Christian clergy) began to spread throughout the empire.

=== Games and recreation ===

The youth of Rome had several forms of athletic play and exercise. Play for boys was supposed to prepare them for active military service, such as jumping, wrestling, boxing, and racing. In the countryside, pastimes for the wealthy also included fishing and hunting. The Romans also had several forms of ball playing, including one resembling handball. Dice games, board games, and gamble games were popular pastimes. For the wealthy, dinner parties presented an opportunity for entertainment, sometimes featuring music, dancing, and poetry readings. The majority, less well-off, sometimes enjoyed similar parties through clubs or associations, but for most Romans, recreational dining usually meant patronising taverns. Children entertained themselves with toys and such games as leapfrog.

Public games and spectacles were sponsored by leading Romans who wished to advertise their generosity and court popular approval; in Rome or its provinces, this usually meant the emperor or his governors. Venues in Rome and the provinces were developed specifically for public games. Rome&#x27;s Colisseum was built in 70 AD under the Roman emperor Vespasian and opened in 80 AD to host other events and gladiatorial combats. Gladiators sometimes fought to the death, but more often to an adjudicated victory, usually in keeping with the mood of the watching crowd. Shows of exotic animals were popular in their own right; but sometimes animals were pitted against human beings, either armed professionals or unarmed criminals who had been condemned to public death.

Chariot racing was extremely popular among all classes. In Rome, these races were usually held at the Circus Maximus, which had been purpose-built for chariot and horse-racing and, as Rome&#x27;s largest public place, was also used for festivals and animal shows. It could seat around 150,000 people;

== Technology ==
Ancient Rome boasted impressive technological feats, using many advancements that were lost in the Middle Ages and not rivalled again until the 19th and 20th centuries. An example of this is insulated glazing, which was not invented again until the 1930s. Many practical Roman innovations were adopted from earlier Greek designs. Advancements were often divided and based on craft. Artisans guarded technologies as trade secrets.

Roman civil engineering and military engineering constituted a large part of Rome&#x27;s technological superiority and legacy, and contributed to the construction of hundreds of roads, bridges, aqueducts, public baths, theatres and arenas. Many monuments, such as the Colosseum, Pont du Gard, and Pantheon, remain as testaments to Roman engineering and culture.

The Romans were renowned for their architecture, which is grouped with Greek traditions into &quot;Classical architecture&quot;. Although there were many differences from Greek architecture, Rome borrowed heavily from Greece in adhering to strict, formulaic building designs and proportions. Aside from two new orders of columns, composite and Tuscan, and from the dome, which was derived from the Etruscan arch, Rome had relatively few architectural innovations until the end of the Republic.

In the 1st century BC, Romans started to use Roman concrete widely. Concrete was invented in the late 3rd century BC. It was a powerful cement derived from pozzolana, and soon supplanted marble as the chief Roman building material and allowed many daring architectural forms. Also in the 1st century BC, Vitruvius wrote , possibly the first complete treatise on architecture in history.

The Romans also largely built using timber, causing a rapid decline of the woodlands surrounding Rome. The first evidence of long-distance wood trading come from the discovery of wood planks, felled between AD 40 and 60, coming from the Jura mountains in northeastern France and ending up more than away, in the foundations of a lavish portico that was part of a vast wealthy patrician villa, in Central Rome. It is suggested that timber, around long, came up to Rome via the Tiber River on ships travelling across the Mediterranean Sea from the confluence of the Saône and Rhône rivers in what is now the city of Lyon in present-day France.
With solid foundations and good drainage, Roman roads were known for their durability and many segments of the Roman road system were still in use a thousand years after the fall of Rome. The construction of a vast and efficient travel network throughout the Empire dramatically increased Rome&#x27;s power and influence. They allowed Roman legions to be deployed rapidly, with predictable marching times between key points of the empire, no matter the season. These highways also had enormous economic significance, solidifying Rome&#x27;s role as a trading crossroads—the origin of the saying &quot;all roads lead to Rome&quot;. The Roman government maintained a system of way stations, known as the , and established a system of horse relays allowing a dispatch to travel up to a day.

The Romans constructed numerous aqueducts to supply water to cities and industrial sites and to aid in their agriculture. By the third century, the city of Rome was supplied by 11 aqueducts with a combined length of . The Romans also made major advancements in sanitation. Romans were particularly famous for their public baths, called , which were used for both hygienic and social purposes. Many Roman houses had flush toilets and indoor plumbing, and a complex sewer system, the , was used to drain the local marshes and carry waste into the Tiber. Some historians have speculated that lead pipes in the sewer and plumbing systems led to widespread lead poisoning, which contributed to fall of Rome; however, lead content would have been minimised.

== Legacy ==

Ancient Rome is the progenitor of Western civilisation. The customs, religion, law, technology, architecture, political system, military, literature, languages, alphabet, government and many factors and aspects of western civilisation are all inherited from Roman advancements. The rediscovery of Roman culture revitalised Western civilisation, playing a role in the Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment.

== Historiography ==
=== Primary and secondary sources ===

The two longest ancient accounts of the Roman history, the histories of Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, were composed 500 years later than the date for the founding of the republic and 200 years from the defeat of Hannibal. Although there has been a diversity of works on ancient Roman history, many of them are lost. As a result of this loss, there are gaps in Roman history, which are filled by unreliable works, such as the &quot;&quot;. Caesar wrote his own accounts of his military campaigns in Gaul and during the Civil War in part to impress his contemporaries.

In the Empire, the biographies of famous men and early emperors flourished, examples being &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot; of Suetonius, and Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;. Other major works of Imperial times were that of Livy and Tacitus.
* Polybius – &quot;The Histories&quot;
* Sallust – &#x27; and &#x27;
* Julius Caesar – &#x27; and &#x27;
* Livy – &quot;&quot;
* Dionysius of Halicarnassus – &quot;Roman Antiquities&quot;
* Pliny the Elder – &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;
* Josephus – &quot;The Jewish War&quot;
* Suetonius – &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot; (&quot;)
* Tacitus – &quot; and &quot;Histories&quot;
* Plutarch – &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; (a series of biographies of famous Roman and Greek men)
* Cassius Dio – &quot;&quot;
* Herodian – &quot;History of the Roman Empire since Marcus Aurelius&quot;
* Ammianus Marcellinus – &quot;&quot;

Interest in studying, and idealising, ancient Rome became prevalent during the Italian Renaissance. Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; &quot;began the modern study of Roman history in the English-speaking world&quot;. Barthold Georg Niebuhr was a founder of the examination of ancient Roman history and wrote &quot;The Roman History&quot;, tracing the period until the First Punic War. During the Napoleonic, &quot;The History of Romans&quot; by Victor Duruy highlighted the Caesarean period popular at the time. &quot;History of Rome&quot;, &quot;Roman constitutional law&quot; and , all by Theodor Mommsen, became milestones.

<text>Annemasse (; Arpitan: &quot;Anemâsse&quot;) is a commune in the Haute-Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in Eastern France. Even though it covers a relatively small territory (4.98 km2 or 1.92 sq mi), it is Haute-Savoie&#x27;s second most populous commune after the prefecture Annecy, with 36,250 residents as of 2018.

Annemasse is part of the Grand Genève (Greater Geneva), a transborder agglomeration between France and Switzerland, which encompasses the developed areas on the southwestern shore of Lake Geneva. It lies near the Swiss border, approximately 8 km (5 mi) east of Geneva. Its railway station is served by TGV, RegioExpress, Léman Express and TER Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes trains.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name Annemasse is uncertain. It could come from an Allobroges tribe; it could be derived from the Gallic name Adnamatius; it could be a reference to the Roman city of Annamatia in Pannonia (current-day Hungary). In ancient Roman times, Annemasse, a &quot;vicus&quot;, was known as Namascae.

Annemasse is part of the metropolitan area of Geneva. It is located 2 km (1.2 mi) southeast of the Swiss border and 45 km (27.9 mi) north of Annecy, the prefecture of Haute-Savoie. The city is surrounded by the Voirons (alt. 1,450 m) to the east and the Salève (alt. 1,300 m) and the Arve River to the west.

==Climate==
The climate is temperate with influences from the Bornes Massif and Lake Geneva. The coldest months are January and February; the hottest are July and August. There is an annual average of 80 days with below zero temperatures. The minimum average is -1 °C and the maximum average is 26 °C. The annual rainfall is 975.7 mm with 118 rainy days a year.
==Demographics==
==Politics==

The urban area of Annemasse, the agglomeration community of Annemasse – Les Voirons, which consists of twelve communes, is the second largest agglomeration in the Haute-Savoie department in terms of population, after the Grand Annecy (Greater Annecy). The Hôtel de Ville (town hall) was completed in 1885.

Robert Borrel of the Socialist Party (PS) held the mayorship in Annemasse from 1977 to 2008. Fellow party member Christian Dupessay was elected to succeed him following his retirement in 2008. Dupessay was reelected in 2014 and 2020.

==Economy==
The main activity is commerce: due to the current foreign exchange situation, many Swiss residents come to Annemasse to purchase food and other commodities. A large proportion of the population work in Geneva, where the salaries are higher than in France.

Annemasse has 1,898 company locations on its territory, a large share of it being shops and services. The three main companies operating in Annemasse are Parker Hannifin (turnover: €134 million), Siegwerk (€107 million) and Géant Casino Annemasse (€17 million, enlarged in 2003).

==Transport==

Annemasse is an important crossroad. It is the last exit of the French motorway A40 before the border and is thus well connected with the other cities of the region. It is also connected to Annecy via motorway A41.

Local transport is done with 6 bus lines by the TP2A company (&quot;Transports publics de l&#x27;Agglomération d&#x27;Annemasse&quot;). A tram is connected to the Swiss border.

Annemasse has had a railway station since 1880. It is the second most important station of the department with 2,000 passengers a day. To encourage mobility, the CEVA project has extended the existing rail connection between Annemasse and Gare de Cornavin through Genève Eaux-Vives.

Annemasse also has a small airport for small tourist and business planes.

==Religion==
Annemasse has several religious places. There are two Roman Catholic churches (Saint-André and Saint-Joseph), one synagogue, two Muslim religious organisations, as well as several Protestant churches.
==Servetus Monument==
In 1903, 350 years after the dissident Michael Servetus was executed in Geneva at the instigation of John Calvin, a committee was formed to erect a monument in Servetus&#x27; honour - led by a French Senator, Auguste Dide, an author of a book on heretics and revolutionaries. The committee commissioned a local Geneva sculptor, Clothilde Roch, to do a statue showing a suffering Servetus. The work was three years in the making and was finished in 1907. However, supporters of Calvin were still strong in Geneva, and the statue was rejected.

The committee then offered the statue to the neighboring Annemasse, which in 1908 placed it in front of the city hall, with the following inscriptions:
“The arrest of Servetus in Geneva, where he did neither publish nor dogmatize, hence he was not subject to its laws, has to be considered as a barbaric act and an insult to the Right of Nations.” Voltaire
&quot;I beg you, shorten please these deliberations. It is clear that Calvin for his pleasure wishes to make me rot in this prison. The lice eat me alive. My clothes are torn and I have nothing for a change, nor shirt, only a worn out vest.”
Servetus, 1553

In 1942, the pro-Nazi Vichy Government took down the statue, as it was a celebration of freedom of conscience, and melted it. In 1960, having found the original molds, Annemasse had it recast and returned the statue to its previous place.

<text>The Peshitta ( &quot;or&quot; &quot;&quot;) is the standard version of the Bible for churches in the Syriac tradition. 

The consensus within biblical scholarship, although not universal, is that the Old Testament of the Peshitta was translated into Syriac from Biblical Hebrew, probably in the 2nd century CE, and that the New Testament of the Peshitta was translated from Koine Greek, probably in the early 5th century. This New Testament, originally excluding certain disputed books (2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, Revelation), had become a standard by the early 5th century. The five excluded books were added in the Harklean Version (616 CE) of Thomas of Harqel. The New Testament of the Peshitta often reflects the Byzantine text-type, although with some variations.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Peshitta&quot; is derived from the Syriac &quot;mappaqtâ pšîṭtâ&quot; (ܡܦܩܬܐ ܦܫܝܛܬܐ), literally meaning &quot;simple version&quot;. However, it is also possible to translate &quot;pšîṭtâ&quot; as &quot;common&quot; (that is, for all people), or &quot;straight&quot;, as well as the usual translation as &quot;simple&quot;. 

Syriac is a dialect, or group of dialects, of Eastern Aramaic, originating around Edessa and is written in its own alphabet. This is transliterated into the Latin script in a number of ways, generating different spellings of the name: &quot;Peshitta&quot;, &quot;Peshittâ&quot;, &quot;Pshitta&quot;, &quot;Pšittâ&quot;, &quot;Pshitto&quot;, &quot;Fshitto&quot;. All of these are acceptable, but &quot;Peshitta&quot; is the most conventional spelling in English.

== Brief history ==
The Peshitta had from the 5th century onward a wide circulation in Asia, and was accepted and honored by the whole diversity of sects of Syriac Christianity. It had a great missionary influence: the Armenian and Georgian versions, as well as the Arabic and the Persian, owe not a little to the Syriac. The Nestorian tablet of Chang&#x27;an shows the presence of the Syriac scriptures in China in the 8th century. 

The Peshitta was first brought to Europe by Moses of Mardin, a noted Syrian ecclesiastic who unsuccessfully sought a patron for the work of printing it in Rome and Venice. However, he was successful in finding such a patron in the Imperial Chancellor of the Holy Roman Empire at Vienna in 1555—Albert Widmanstadt. He undertook the printing of the New Testament, and the emperor bore the cost of the special types which had to be cast for its issue in Syriac. Immanuel Tremellius, the converted Jew whose scholarship was so valuable to the English reformers and divines, made use of it, and in 1569 issued a Syriac New Testament in Hebrew script. In 1645, the &quot;editio princeps&quot; of the Old Testament was published by Gabriel Sionita for the Paris Polyglot, and in 1657 the whole Peshitta was included in Walton&#x27;s &quot;London Polyglot&quot;. An edition of the Peshitta was that of John Leusden and Karl Schaaf, and it is still quoted under the symbol &quot;Syrschaaf&quot;, or &quot;SyrSch&quot;.

== New Testament ==
In a detailed examination of Matthew 1–14, George Gwilliam found that where texts differ, the Peshitta agrees with the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; only 108 times and with the &quot;Codex Vaticanus&quot; 65 times. Meanwhile, in 137 instances it differs from both, usually with the support of the Old Syriac and the Old Latin, and in 31 instances it stands alone.

A statement by Eusebius that Hegesippus &quot;made some quotations from the Gospel according to the Hebrews and from the Syriac Gospel,&quot; means we should have a reference to a Syriac New Testament as early as 160–180 CE, the time of that Hebrew Christian writer. The translation of the New Testament has been admired by Syriac scholars, who have deemed it &quot;careful, faithful, and literal&quot; with it sometimes being referred to as the &quot;Queen of the versions&quot;.

== Critical edition of the New Testament ==
The standard United Bible Societies 1905 edition of the New Testament of the Peshitta was based on editions prepared by Syriacists Philip E. Pusey (d. 1880), Gwilliam (d. 1914) and John Gwynn. These editions comprised Gwilliam &amp; Pusey&#x27;s 1901 critical edition of the gospels, Gwilliam&#x27;s critical edition of Acts, Gwilliam &amp; Pinkerton&#x27;s critical edition of Paul&#x27;s Epistles and John Gwynn&#x27;s critical edition of the General Epistles and later Revelation. This critical Peshitta text is based on a collation of more than seventy Peshitta and a few other Aramaic manuscripts. All 27 books of the common Western Canon of the New Testament are included in this British &amp; Foreign Bible Society&#x27;s 1905 Peshitta edition, as is the adultery pericope (John 7:53–8:11). The 1979 Syriac Bible, United Bible Society, uses the same text for its New Testament. The Online Bible reproduces the 1905 Syriac Peshitta NT in Hebrew characters.

<text>Auch (; ) is a commune in southwestern France. Located in the region of Occitanie, it is the capital of the Gers department. 

==Geography==

=== Localization ===

The commune of Auch is located in the arrondissement of Auch and in the Gers valley, roughly in the centre of the Gers département. Auch is west of Toulouse, the capital of the Occitanie region, and from Montauban, from Agen, from Mont-de-Marsan, from Pau and from Tarbes, the capitals of the neighbouring départements. It is 162 km from Bordeaux, from Marseille and from Lyon, the capitals of the neighbouring regions, and south-west of Paris.

The commune covers an area of .

===Surrounding communes===
Auch borders thirteen other communes: Barran, Castillon-Massas, Castin, Duran, Lasséran, Leboulin, Montaut-les-Créneaux, Montégut, Ordan-Larroque, Pavie, Pessan, Preignan and Roquelaure.

===Geology and relief===
Auch has a minimum altitude of and a maximum of . Its average altitude is , while that of its town hall is The town and its surroundings have a hillside landscape.

Centred on the middle Baïse valley, Armagnac is distributed along an east-west axis between Eauze and Auch. It includes Fezensac and Vic.

The commune is located in seismicity zone 1 (very low seismicity).

=== Hydrography ===
The Gers, a tributary of the Garonne, flows through the town and divides the city between the upper town, on the left bank, the site of the medieval city built on a hill where most of the ancient monuments are to be found, and the lower town, built on the plain on the right bank. The upper town is linked to the banks of the Gers by the medieval &quot;pousterles&quot;, typical narrow streets with steep inclines, and by the monumental staircase inaugurated in 1863. The north of the town is also watered by the Arçon and Talouch rivers, tributaries of the Gers.

The lower town was devastated on several occasions (1897, 1952 for the most significant river overflow) before the course of the Gers was recalibrated following the 1977 floods in Gascony.

=== Transportation ===
Auch is well connected to nearby cities and towns such as Agen, Toulouse and Tarbes by Routes Nationales and by train to Toulouse.

===Climate===
==History and population==


Auch is a very ancient town, whose settlement was noted by the Romans during their conquest of the area in the . At that time, it was settled by an Aquitanian tribe known to the Romans as the Ausci. Their name for the town was Climberrum or Elimberris. This has been tentatively etymologized from the Iberian &quot;iltir&quot; (&quot;town, oppidum&quot;) and a cognate of the Basque &quot;berri&quot; (&quot;new&quot;), although another Iberian settlement in Granada recorded by the Romans as &quot;Iliberi&quot; probably had no contact with proto-Basque speaking peoples. The Romans renamed the town Augusta Auscorum or Ausciorum (&quot;Augusta of the Ausci&quot;). Augusta Auscorum was one of the twelve civitates of the province of Novempopulana (Gascony) and became the provincial capital after the 409 destruction of Eauze by the Vandals.

The common term Augusta was eventually dropped and the name evolved into the modern Gascon &quot;Aush&quot; and French &quot;Auch&quot;.

In 732, Abdul Rahman&#x27;s army inflicted severe damage upon the town as they advanced towards Bordeaux, securing victory over Odo in the Battle of the River Garonne, and
ultimately meeting defeat in the crucial Battle of Tours.

The town became the seat of a Catholic archdiocese which lasted until the French Revolution. Its archbishops claimed the title of Primate of Aquitaine, Novempopulana, and Navarre.

<doc id="521565" wikidata="Q358399" url="?curid=521565" title="Wilhelm Marstrand">
<text>Nicolai Wilhelm Marstrand (24 December 1810 – 25 March 1873), painter and illustrator, was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, to Nicolai Jacob Marstrand, instrument maker and inventor, and Petra Othilia Smith. Marstrand is one of the most renowned artists belonging to the Golden Age of Danish Painting.

== Early development and academy training ==
Marstrand studied at Copenhagen&#x27;s Metropolitan School (&quot;Metropolitanskolen&quot;), but had little interest in books, and left around 16 years of age. Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, painter and professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Art () in Copenhagen, was a close friend of Wilhelm&#x27;s father, and it was to all appearance Eckersberg who recommended an artistic career for young Wilhelm. Wilhelm had already shown artistic talent, tackling difficult subjects such as group scenes with many figures and complicated composition.

At 16 years of age Marstrand thus began his studies at the Academy under Eckersberg, attending the school from 1826 to 1833. Although his interests had a firm hold in genre themes – depiction of the daily life he observed around him in Copenhagen&#x27;s streets, especially middle-class society – he would soon reach for the pinnacle of academic acceptability: the history painting.

History painting displayed what was grand – classical themes from mythology and history, rather than daily life. The traditions, and the taste of traditional art critics, strongly favored it. It was therefore something to strive for, in spite of Marstrand&#x27;s equal skill at depicting more modest themes, and of the enjoyment he had in portraying the crowds, the diversions of the city, and the humor and story behind the hustle and bustle. Marstrand&#x27;s creative production would, through many paintings and illustrations made not only during the 1830s but throughout his life, never abandon this inclination toward displaying the simple life of his times.

At the same time Christian Waagepetersen, wine merchant to the Danish court and supporter of the arts, also became an important patron for Marstrand during this early period. His painting &quot;A musical evening party&quot; () (1834), depicts such an occasion at the home of Waagepetersen, and was an important transition painting for Marstrand.

Despite an unmistakably growing recognition, Marstrand never received the Academy&#x27;s gold medal. This medal was coveted not only for its great prestige, but also because it came with a travel stipend for furthering the laureate&#x27;s artistic training. Marstrand&#x27;s attempts at winning the medal were unsuccessful both in 1833 with his neoclassical &quot;Flight to Egypt&quot; () and in 1835 with &quot;Odysseus and Nausikaa&quot;. This was a disappointment, as he had won both available silver medals in 1833.

== Foreign travel ==

Gold medal or not however, the Academy did award Marstrand a travel stipend. In August 1836 he began the first of his many travels, going by way of Germany to Rome in Italy, stopping on the way at Berlin, Dresden, Nuremberg and Munich. In Italy, where he stayed for four years, he painted many idealized depictions of daily life, especially festivities. He returned to Italy several times, the last visit being in 1869, and when in Rome he spent summer months each year in the hill towns Olevano Romano, Civitella and Subiaco. He was enchanted with Italy and with the ways of life of the Italian people. He portrayed a colorful, joyous, and romantic view of them, infused with a newfound ideal of beauty.

He also painted a number of portraits during this first stay in Italy. Among these are portraits of other travelling Danish artists, such as Christen Købke and travelling partner Johan Adolph Kittendorff. He completed sketches for a large portrait of botanist and politician, J. F. Schouw, which would be later realized as a painting.

== Career development ==

Marstrand returned to Denmark at the end of 1841, stopping in Munich and Paris on the way. In Denmark he strove to bring back that which he learned in Italy, and allow it to develop in his home culture.

He became a member of the art Academy on 19 June 1843, after submitting the painting &quot;Erasmus Montanus&quot; as his admissions piece. He became a professor at the Academy in 1848. He endeavored to let his students evolve according to their own skills and interests. Among these were the two most renowned Skagen painters Peder Severin Krøyer and Michael Ancher, as well as Carl Bloch and Kristian Zahrtmann.

Marstrand continued to travel regularly around Europe throughout his life, to (London, Vienna, Belgium, but especially to Italy and Rome), at times in the company of such fellow artists such as P. C. Skovgaard and Johan Adolph Kittendorff, or of art historian and critic Niels Lauritz Høyen.

Marstrand also continued to apply inspiration from Italy in his paintings. He now supplied it with themes from literature and the theatre, portraying scenes from &quot;Don Quixote&quot; by Cervantes, as well as from &quot;Erasmus Montanus,&quot; or other plays by Ludvig Holberg. Holberg&#x27;s works would in fact provide Marstrand with an endless stream of inspiration. He also continued to paint genre paintings, and to make sketches, caricatures, and drawings, capturing the spirit of his time with gentle or more biting satire.

On 8 June 1850, Marstrand married Margrethe Christine Weidemann, with whom he was to have five children. His family became yet a new source for his art. There are similarities in his portraits with children to those made by Constantin Hansen, a contemporary, friend, and also student of Eckersberg.

Marstrand returned to portrait painting with even more seriousness in the late 1850s, depicting some of the key figures of the age, including Constantin Hansen (1852, 1862), Bernhard Severin Ingemann (1860), Grundtvig (1863), Høyen (1869), the architect Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll, not forgetting his earlier portraiture of Købke in 1839.

During the 1850s and 1860s, and especially after the death of his wife in 1867, he finally turned to religious themes. He also gave renewed attention to mythology and history. He painted two remarkable great murals for King Christian IV&#x27;s chapel in Roskilde Cathedral in 1864–1866, both of which have contributed to this popular monarch&#x27;s enduring fame. He painted an important altarpiece at Faaborg Church. In 1871, not long before his death, he delivered several massive wall paintings commissioned for the University of Copenhagen&#x27;s Celebration Hall. This historical, religious, and monumental development added yet an essential dimension to the already broad scope of Marstrand&#x27;s work.

At the same time, during the last ten years of his life, part of his work became very intimate. A series of paintings made during the last 6 years of his life featured a naked woman, while others were deeply religious, more inwardly so than the monumental work.

Marstrand was named Director (Chancellor) of the art Academy during two periods: the first period from 1853–1857, the second from 1863 until his death. In 1867 he was awarded the rank of State Councillor (&quot;etatsråd&quot;).

In October 1871 Marstrand was struck with a brain hemorrhage and partially paralysed, losing much of his work capacity before his death in 1873.

== Posthumous reception ==
To his contemporaries and a further few generations, Marstrand ranked among Denmark&#x27;s great painters of all time, to some authorities perhaps as the very greatest. Certainly, he was vastly productive and mastered a remarkable variety of genres – his disinterest for landscape art being a notable exception. More relevant today is the rather striking number of his works which are now familiar signposts of Danish history and culture: scenes from drawing-rooms and streets of Copenhagen during his younger days; the festivity and public life captured in Rome; the many representative portraits of citizens and innovators; even the monumentalist commissions for university and monarchy. Still, as the 20th century progressed, his work had become less valued artistically and downright unfashionable; conversely, recent decades seem to have afforded new appreciation.

<text>The Western Plateau is Australia&#x27;s largest drainage division and is composed predominantly of the remains of the ancient rock shield of Gondwana. It covers two thirds of the continent; of arid land, including large parts of Western Australia, South Australia, and the Northern Territory. For comparison, it is roughly the same size as the whole of continental Europe from Poland west to Portugal.

Rain rarely falls in this region and aside from a handful of permanent waterholes, surface water is absent at all times except after heavy rain. Most of the territory is flat sandy or stony desert with a sparse covering of shrubs or tussock grasses. Average rainfall varies from one area to another and is quoted at to per year, but is highly unpredictable.

<doc id="521568" wikidata="Q232340" url="?curid=521568" title="Edie Sedgwick">
<text>Edith Minturn Sedgwick Post (April 20, 1943 – November 16, 1971) was an American actress, model and socialite who was one of Andy Warhol&#x27;s superstars, starring in several of his short films during the 1960s. Her prominence led to her being dubbed an &quot;It Girl&quot;, while &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine named her a &quot;Youthquaker&quot;.

Sedgwick broke with Warhol in 1966 and attempted to forge an independent acting career. However, her mental health deteriorated from drug abuse and she struggled to complete the semi-autobiographical film &quot;Ciao! Manhattan&quot;. Sedgwick abstained from drugs and alcohol after meeting her future husband, Michael Post, and completed filming &quot;Ciao! Manhattan&quot; in early 1971. Post and Sedgwick married in July 1971; she died four months later of an overdose at age 28.

== Early life and education (1943–1964) ==
Edie Sedgwick was born in Santa Barbara, California, the seventh of eight children of Alice Delano de Forest (1908–1988) and Francis Minturn Sedgwick (1904–1967), a rancher, sculptor and member of the historical Sedgwick family of Massachusetts. Sedgwick&#x27;s mother was the daughter of Henry Wheeler de Forest, the president and chairman of the board of the Southern Pacific Railroad. She was named after her father&#x27;s aunt, Edith Minturn Stokes, who was famously painted with her husband, Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes, by John Singer Sargent. She was of English and French Huguenot ancestry.

Despite the family&#x27;s wealth and high social status, Sedgwick&#x27;s early life was troubled. Initially schooled at home and cared for by nannies, the Sedgwick children were rigidly controlled by their parents. Being raised on their father&#x27;s California ranches, they were largely isolated from the outside world and were instilled with the idea that they were superior to most of their peers. It was within these familial and social conditions that Sedgwick by her early teens developed an eating disorder, settling into an early pattern of binging and purging. At age 13 (the year her grandfather Henry Dwight Sedgwick died), she began boarding at the Branson School near San Francisco. According to her older sister Alice &quot;Saucie&quot; Sedgwick, she was soon taken out of the school because of her eating disorder. Her father severely restricted her freedom when she returned home.

All the Sedgwick children had conflicted relationships with their father (whom they called &quot;Fuzzy&quot;). By most accounts, he was narcissistic, emotionally remote, controlling and frequently abusive. He also openly carried on extramarital affairs with other women. On one occasion, Edie walked in on her father while he was having sex with one of his mistresses. She reacted with great surprise, but he claimed that she had imagined it, slapped her and called a doctor to administer tranquilizers to her. As an adult, Sedgwick told people that he had attempted to molest her several times, beginning when she was aged 7.

In 1958, Sedgwick&#x27;s parents enrolled her at St. Timothy&#x27;s School in Maryland. She was eventually taken out of the school due to her continuing eating disorder, which had progressed to anorexia. In the autumn of 1962, at her father&#x27;s insistence, Sedgwick was committed to the private Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan, Connecticut. As the regime was very lax, she easily manipulated her situation at Silver Hill and her weight kept dropping. She was later sent to Bloomingdale, the behavioral health wing in the Westchester County division of New York Hospital, where her anorexia improved markedly. Around the time she left the hospital, she had a brief relationship with a Harvard student, became pregnant and procured an abortion, citing her present psychological issues.

In the autumn of 1963, Sedgwick moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and began studying sculpture with her cousin, artist Lily Saarinen. According to Saarinen, Sedgwick &quot;was very insecure about men, though all the men loved her.&quot; During this period, she partied with members of an elite bohemian fringe of the Harvard social scene.

Sedgwick was deeply affected by the loss of her older brothers, Francis Jr. (known as &quot;Minty&quot;) and Robert (known as &quot;Bobby&quot;), who died within eighteen months of each other. Francis, who had a particularly unhappy relationship with their father, suffered several mental breakdowns, eventually committing suicide in 1964 while at Silver Hill Hospital. Robert, her second oldest brother, also suffered from mental health problems and died when his motorcycle crashed into the side of a New York City bus on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1965.

On her twenty-first birthday in April 1964, Sedgwick received an $80,000 trust fund from her maternal grandmother. In September 1964, she relocated to New York to pursue a career in modeling. In December 1964, she was injured in an automobile accident.

== The Factory (1965–1966) ==

=== Films ===
In March 1965, Sedgwick met artist and avant-garde filmmaker Andy Warhol at a party at the apartment of producer Lester Persky and began frequently visiting Warhol&#x27;s art studio, The Factory, in Midtown Manhattan. During one of her subsequent visits, Warhol was filming &quot;Vinyl&quot; (1965), his interpretation of Anthony Burgess&#x27; novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Despite &quot;Vinyl&quot;″s all-male cast, Warhol put Sedgwick in the movie. Around this time, she also made a small cameo appearance in another Warhol film, &quot;Horse&quot; (1965). Sedgwick&#x27;s appearances in both films were brief but generated enough interest that Warhol decided to cast her in the starring role of his next films.

The first of these films, &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl&quot; (1965), was originally conceived as part of a series of films featuring Sedgwick called &quot;The Poor Little Rich Girl Saga&quot;. The series was to include &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl&quot;, &quot;Restaurant&quot;, &quot;Face&quot; and &quot;Afternoon&quot;. Filming of &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl&quot; began in March 1965 in Sedgwick&#x27;s apartment; it depicted her going about her daily routines. Her next film for Warhol was &quot;Kitchen&quot;, which was filmed in May 1965 but not released until 1966. Written by Factory scriptwriter Ronald Tavel, the film stars Sedgwick, Rene Ricard, Roger Trudeau, Donald Lyons and Elecktrah. After &quot;Kitchen&quot;, Chuck Wein replaced Tavel as a writer and assistant director for the filming of &quot;Beauty No. 2&quot; (1965), which was filmed in June and premiered in July 1965. The film shows Sedgwick lounging on a bed in her underwear with Gino Piserchio and being taunted by Wein off-screen.

Sedgwick and Warhol continued making films together —&quot;Outer and Inner Space&quot;, &quot;Prison&quot;, &quot;Lupe&quot; and &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot;— throughout 1965. The edited footage of Sedgwick in &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot; would eventually become the film &quot;Afternoon&quot;. Their relationship deteriorated by late 1965, however, and Sedgwick demanded that Warhol stop showing her films. &quot;Lupe&quot; is often thought to be Sedgwick&#x27;s last Warhol film, but she filmed &quot;The Andy Warhol Story&quot; with Rene Ricard in November 1966, almost a year after finishing &quot;Lupe&quot;. &quot;The Andy Warhol Story&quot; was an unreleased film that was only screened once at The Factory. Along with Sedgwick, the film featured Ricard satirically pretending to be Warhol.

=== Style icon ===
Warhol&#x27;s films were for the most part shown only in underground film theaters and in viewings held at The Factory, and were not commercially successful. Regardless, Sedgwick began receiving attention from the mainstream media, who reported on her appearances in the films and on her personal style. During this period, she developed a distinct look including black leotards, mini dresses, large chandelier earrings and heavy eye make-up. She popularized the mini-skirt by purchasing children&#x27;s skirts and wearing them as her own. Sedgwick also cut her naturally brown hair short and dyed it with silver spray, thus matching her look with Warhol&#x27;s, who was known for wearing silvery hair pieces.

Warhol dubbed Sedgwick his &quot;Superstar&quot;, and they began appearing together at various public events. The previously niche phrase &quot;Superstar&quot; was popularized and became a mainstream term because of Sedgwick being dubbed one by Andy Warhol and the increased mainstream media attention the pair received. Sedgwick can be seen defining the term on the Merv Griffin Show, indicating that the word was not a staple in the general public&#x27;s vocabulary before her appearance on the show.

In a photoshoot for &quot;Vogue magazine&quot; in August 1965, Sedgwick was photographed by Enzo Sellerio, wearing only hosiery and a black ballet leotard, as she balanced on the back of a leather rhinoceros. Vogue dubbed her an &quot;It Girl&quot; and a &quot;Youthquaker&quot;. In November 1965, Fred Eberstadt photographed her for &quot;Life&quot; &quot;magazine&quot; under the title &quot;Girl in Black Tights&quot;. Her distinctive style, which featured black leotards and tights, miniskirts, chandelier earrings, and heavy eye makeup, made her a style icon of the 1960s.

In 1966, Sedgwick was named one of the &quot;fashion revolutionaries&quot; in New York by &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;, alongside Tiger Morse, Baby Jane Holzer, Pierre Cardin, Paco Rabanne, Rudi Gernreich, André Courrèges, Emanuel Ungaro, Yves Saint Laurent and Mary Quant.

== Later years (1967–1971) ==
After breaking with Warhol, Sedgwick attempted to forge a legitimate acting career. She auditioned for Norman Mailer when the stage adaptation of his novel &quot;The Deer Park&quot; was being produced. But Mailer &quot;turned her down...—She was very good in a sort of tortured and wholly sensitive way—...She used so much of herself with every line that we knew she&#x27;d be immolated after three performances.&quot;

In March 1967, Sedgwick began what may have seemed propitious but in fact began her torturous and final decline: the shooting of &quot;Ciao! Manhattan&quot;, a semi-autobiographical underground film co-directed by John Palmer and David Weisman. During this, Sedgwick accidentally set her room on fire in the Chelsea Hotel and was briefly hospitalized with burns. Due to her rapidly deteriorating health from drug use, the film was suspended. After further hospitalizations for drug abuse and mental issues in 1968 and 1969, Sedgwick returned to her family&#x27;s ranch in California to recuperate. In August 1969, she was hospitalized again in the psychiatric ward of the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital after being arrested for drug offenses by local police. While in the hospital, Sedgwick met another patient, Michael Post, whom she married in July 1971.

Sedgwick was hospitalized again in the summer of 1970 but was let out under the supervision of a psychiatrist, two nurses and the live-in care of filmmaker John Palmer and his wife Janet. Determined to finish &quot;Ciao! Manhattan&quot; and have her story told, Sedgwick reconnected with the film crew and began shooting in Arcadia and Santa Barbara in late 1970. She also recorded audio tapes reflecting on her life story, accounts Weisman and Palmer incorporated into the film&#x27;s dramatic arc. Filming completed in early 1971, and the film was released in February 1972.

==Death==
On the night of November 15, 1971, Sedgwick went to a fashion show at the Santa Barbara Museum that included a segment filmed for the television show &quot;An American Family&quot;. After the show, she attended a party where she drank alcohol. She then phoned her husband to pick her up. On the way home, Sedgwick expressed thoughts of uncertainty about their marriage. Before they both fell asleep, Post gave Sedgwick medication that had been prescribed for her. According to Post, Sedgwick started to fall asleep very quickly and her breathing was &quot;bad – it sounded like there was a big hole in her lungs&quot; but he attributed it to her heavy smoking habit and went to sleep.

When Post awoke the following morning at 7:30 a.m., he found Sedgwick dead. The coroner ruled her death as &quot;undetermined/ accident/suicide&quot;. Her death certificate states the immediate cause was &quot;probable acute barbiturate intoxication&quot; due to ethanol intoxication. Sedgwick&#x27;s alcohol level was registered at 0.17% and her barbiturate level was 0.48 mg%. She was 28.

Sedgwick was not buried in her family&#x27;s Sedgwick Pie cemetery plot but in the small Oak Hill Cemetery in Ballard, California. Her epitaph reads &quot;Edith Sedgwick Post – Wife of Michael Brett Post 1943–1971&quot;.

== Personal life ==

=== Relationships ===
Following her estrangement from Warhol&#x27;s inner circle, Sedgwick began living at the Chelsea Hotel, where she became close to Bob Dylan. Dylan and his friends eventually convinced Sedgwick to sign up with Albert Grossman, Dylan&#x27;s manager. According to Paul Morrissey, Sedgwick had developed a crush on Dylan that she thought he reciprocated. She was also under the impression that she and Dylan would star in a mainstream film together. Unbeknownst to Sedgwick, however, Dylan had secretly married his girlfriend Sara Lownds in November 1965. Morrissey claimed that Sedgwick was informed of the marriage by Warhol (who reportedly heard about it through his lawyer) in February 1966. Friends of Sedgwick&#x27;s later said that she saw the supposed offer of doing a film with Dylan as a ticket to a mainstream film career. Morrissey claimed that Dylan likely never had plans to star in a film with Sedgwick and &quot;hadn&#x27;t been very truthful.&quot;

Since Sedgwick&#x27;s death, Dylan has routinely denied that he ever had a romantic relationship with her but did acknowledge knowing her. In December 2006, several weeks before the release of the controversial film &quot;Factory Girl&quot;, the Weinstein Company and the film&#x27;s producers interviewed Sedgwick&#x27;s older brother, Jonathan, who claimed that Sedgwick told him she had aborted a baby she claimed was Dylan&#x27;s shortly after she was injured in a motorcycle accident. As a result of the accident, doctors consigned her to a mental hospital, where she was treated for drug addiction. No records from a hospital or the Sedgwick family exist to support this story. Nonetheless, Jonathan claimed, &quot;Staff found she was pregnant but, fearing the baby had been damaged by her drug use and anorexia, forced her to have the abortion.&quot;

Throughout most of 1966, Sedgwick was involved in an intense but troubled relationship with Dylan&#x27;s friend Bob Neuwirth. During this time, she became increasingly dependent on barbiturates. In early 1967, unable to cope with Sedgwick&#x27;s drug abuse and erratic behavior, Neuwirth broke off their relationship.

=== Marriage ===
Sedgwick met Michael Post at a hospital in Santa Barbara. Post was also attempting to quit drugs. After their wedding on July 24, 1971, Post claims he has helped her achieve sobriety. However, in October 1971, Sedgwick relapsed after taking prescription pain medication given to her for a physical illness, which in turn led to abusing barbiturates and alcohol.

== In pop culture ==
=== Books ===
In 1982, &quot;Edie Sedgwick: An American Biography&quot; written by Jean Stein was published by Alfred A Knopf.

In 2022, Sedgwick&#x27;s sister Alice Sedgwick Wohl released the book &quot;As It Turns Out: Thinking About Edie and Andy&quot;.

=== Film and theater ===
In the 1980s, Warren Beatty bought the rights to Sedgwick&#x27;s life story and was planning to make a movie, initially with Molly Ringwald then with Jennifer Jason Leigh starring as Sedgwick. Al Pacino was tapped to play Andy Warhol. It was also reported that a film titled &quot;The War at Home&quot; was to be loosely based on her life during The Factory years, with Linda Fiorentino slated to portray her. It was to be based on John Byrum&#x27;s fictionalized account of a working-class man who becomes enamored of her. Neither was ever produced.

Actress and model Jennifer Rubin played Sedgwick in the 1991 film &quot;The Doors&quot;, directed by Oliver Stone. In the 2002 film &quot;Igby Goes Down&quot;, Amanda Peet&#x27;s character, Rachel, is described as an &quot;Edie Sedgwick wanna-be&quot; and dresses in Sedgwick-inspired attire throughout the film.

A 2004 off-Broadway play entitled &quot;Andy &amp; Edie&quot; was written and produced by Peter Braunstein. It ran for 10 days. Misha Moore, who portrayed Sedgwick, claimed to be the late model&#x27;s niece. At the request of the Sedgwick family, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a notice of correction.

In the 2000s, director Mike Nichols and actress Natalie Portman considered doing a film about Sedgwick and Andy Warhol but decided to film an adaptation of Patrick Marber&#x27;s play &quot;Closer&quot; instead, which was released in 2004.

Sienna Miller played Sedgwick in George Hickenlooper&#x27;s film &quot;Factory Girl&quot;, a fictionalized account of Sedgwick&#x27;s life, released in December 2006. The film portrays Warhol, played by Guy Pearce, as a cynic who leads Sedgwick into a downward spiral of drug addiction and psychiatric problems. Hayden Christensen plays &quot;Billy Quinn&quot;, an apparent conglomeration of various characters but a look-alike of Bob Dylan. Dylan was apparently threatening to pursue a defamation lawsuit, claiming the film implicates him as having driven Sedgwick to her death. Michael Post, Sedgwick&#x27;s widower, appears as a taxi driver in one of the last scenes of the film.

In the 2007 film &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;, Michelle Williams&#x27;s character Coco Rivington is modeled on Sedgwick.

Directed by Melissa Painter and David Weisman, the 2010 short film &quot;Edie: Girl on Fire&quot;, accompanied the book release of the same title, with an archived audio interview of Sedgwick on CD.

The 2021 animated short film &quot;Too Late&quot;, by Polish artist Kinga Syrek, was a tribute to Edie Sedgwick&#x27;s life story and was released for the 50th anniversary of her death.

<doc id="521570" wikidata="Q1069078" url="?curid=521570" title="Debito Arudou">
<text>is an American-born Japanese writer, blogger, and human rights activist. He was born in the United States and became a naturalized Japanese citizen in 2000. Arudou has since left Japan after living in the country for over 20 years.

==Background==
===Early life and academic career===
Arudou was born David Christopher Schofill in California in 1965. He was raised in Geneva, New York, and became &quot;David Christopher Aldwinckle&quot; when his stepfather adopted him in the 1970s. He graduated from Cornell University in 1987, dedicating his senior year to studying Japanese after visiting his pen pal and future wife in Japan. Aldwinckle moved to Japan for one year where he taught English in Sapporo, Hokkaido, and later spent one year at the Japan Management Academy in Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture, before returning to complete a Master&#x27;s of Pacific International Affairs (MPIA) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).

In 1993, Arudou joined the faculty of Business Administration and Information Science at the Hokkaido Information University, a private university in Ebetsu, Hokkaido, where he taught courses in business English and debate. He was an associate professor until 2011 when he left the university. From 2012 to 2013, Arudou was an Affiliate Scholar at the East–West Center in Honolulu, Hawai&#x27;i. Meiji Gakuin University awarded him a Doctorate in Philosophy (International Studies) in 2014.

===Family and Japanese naturalization===
Aldwinckle married a Japanese citizen in 1989, and they have two daughters. Aldwinckle became a permanent resident of Japan in 1996. He became a naturalized Japanese citizen in 2000. On becoming Japanese, he changed his name to , taking his wife&#x27;s surname. They divorced in 2006.

==Activism==
===&quot;Arudou v. Earth Cure&quot;===

Arudou objected to the policies of three bathhouses in Hokkaido, Japan, in the late 1990s that had posted &quot;No Foreigners&quot; or &quot;Japanese Only&quot; signs on their doors.

Arudou led a multinational group of 17 people of various nationalities (United States, Chinese, German, and Japanese) to enter the Yunohana bathhouse in Otaru and test the firmness of the &quot;No Foreigners&quot; policy posted on its door. The group attempted the walk-ins twice.

Arudou returned to Yunohana in October 2000 for a third time as a naturalized Japanese citizen, but again was refused entry. The manager accepted that Arudou was a Japanese national, but refused him entry on the grounds that his foreign appearance could drive Japanese customers to take their business elsewhere. Yunohana had previously closed its bathhouse due to a decline in Japanese customers caused by the poor bathing habits of Russian sailors, and to prevent a repeat of this situation, the company refused entry to anyone who appeared to be a foreign national.

In February 2001, Arudou and two co-plaintiffs, Kenneth Lee Sutherland and Olaf Karthaus, sued Earth Cure in district court pleading racial discrimination, and the City of Otaru for violation of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, a treaty which Japan ratified in 1996. On November 11, 2002, the Sapporo District Court ordered Earth Cure to pay the plaintiffs ¥1 million each in damages. The court stated that &quot;categorically refusing all foreigners constitutes irrational discrimination, exceeds social norms, and amounts to an illegal act&quot;. The Sapporo District and High Courts both dismissed Arudou&#x27;s claim against the city of Otaru for not creating an anti-discrimination ordinance. It stated that &quot;issues such as which measures to take, and how to implement them, are properly left to the discretion of Otaru&quot;. The Sapporo High Court upheld these rulings on September 16, 2004, and the Supreme Court of Japan denied review on April 7, 2005.

===Other protests===
In 2003, Arudou and several other long-term foreign residents dressed up as seals to protest the granting of an honorary &quot;jūminhyō&quot; (residency registration) to Tama-chan, a male bearded seal, in Nishi Ward, Yokohama. The protesters asserted that if the government could grant jūminhyō to animals and animation characters, as was the case in Niiza and Kasukabe Cities, Saitama Prefecture, then there was no need to deny foreign residents the same. At the time, non-Japanese residents were registered in a separate alien registration system.

In February 2007, Arudou participated in a protest against an over-the-counter Japanese-language publication titled &quot;Kyōgaku no Gaijin Hanzai Ura File – Gaijin Hanzai Hakusho 2007&quot; &quot;(Secret Files of Foreigners&#x27; Crimes)&quot;. The magazine highlighted crimes committed by foreigners. Arudou, calling the magazine &quot;ignorant propaganda&quot; that &quot;focuses exclusively on the bad things that some foreigners do, but has absolutely nothing about crimes committed by Japanese&quot;. Arudou posted a bilingual letter for readers to take to FamilyMart stores protesting discrimination against non-Japanese residents of Japan.

In June 2008, Arudou lodged a complaint with the Hokkaido Prefectural Police that its officers were targeting foreigners as part of a security sweep prior to the 34th G8 summit in Tōyako, Hokkaido. This followed an incident where Arudou asserted his right under the Police Execution of Duties Law to not need to show identification when requested by a police officer at New Chitose Airport. After meeting with police representatives at their headquarters, Arudou held a press conference covered by a local television station.

In August 2009, Arudou—acting as the chair of FRANCA (the Foreign Residents and Naturalized Citizens Association)—began a letter-writing campaign to protest an advertisement by McDonald&#x27;s Japan featuring a bespectacled, mildly geeky, 43-year-old American Japanophile known as Mr. James—a burger mascot who proclaims his love for the fast-food outlet in broken katakana Japanese. Writing in &quot;The Japan Times&quot;, Arudou argued that the &quot;Mr. James&quot; campaign perpetuates negative stereotypes about non-Japanese Caucasian minorities living in Japan, and demanded that McDonald&#x27;s Japan withdraw the advertisement: &quot;Imagine McDonald&#x27;s, a multinational that has long promoted cultural diversity, launching a McAsia Menu in America featuring a deep-bowing, grimacing Asian in a bathrobe and platform sandals saying &#x27;Me likee McFlied Lice!&#x27; or &#x27;So solly, prease skosh honorable teriyaki sandrich? &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Coco Masters concluded: &quot;To protest Mr. James as a stereotype of a minority population in Japan because the Ohio native fails to speak or write Japanese fluently, dresses like a nerd and blogs about burgers only ends up underscoring the fact that there really aren&#x27;t a lot of foreigners who fit the bill running around Japan.&quot;

== Reception ==
Eric Weiner described Arudou as an &quot;outspoken man that rejects the notion that there&#x27;s one Japanese way of doing anything&quot;. &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalist Doug Struck described Arudou as &quot;the Outraged Man, tilting at uncomfortable truths about Japanese racial discrimination&quot;

Japanologist Alex Kerr has criticized Arudou for his &quot;openly combative attitude&quot;, an approach that Kerr says usually &quot;fails&quot; in Japan and may reinforce the belief &quot;that &quot;gaijin&quot; are difficult to deal with&quot;. John Spiri, associate professor at Gifu Shotoku Gakuen University, argues that Arudou&#x27;s tactics are excessive, that he tends to perceive things as &quot;black and white&quot;, and that he is &quot;more interested in attacking Japan and its people than fighting stereotyping and injustice&quot;.

==Publications==
Arudou had a book published about the 1999 Otaru hot springs incident, originally in Japanese, and then in 2004 in an expanded English version, . The book is listed in the Japan Policy Research Institute&#x27;s recommended library on Japan.

Arudou&#x27;s next book, published in 2008, was coauthored with and titled . This bilingual book provides information on visas, starting businesses, securing jobs, resolving legal problems, and planning for the future from entry into Japan to death. &quot;Handbook&quot; came out in 2012 in an updated 2nd Edition and an ebook version in 2013.

Arudou has written a monthly column for the Community section of &quot;The Japan Times&quot; titled &quot;Just Be Cause&quot; since 2008, and has contributed occasional opinion columns to the newspaper since 2002. He was also a columnist for the &quot;Japan Today&quot; website and has been featured in &quot;The Asahi Evening News&quot;.

In 2011, Arudou self-published his first novella titled &quot;In Appropriate: a novel of culture, kidnapping, and revenge in modern Japan&quot;. The novella tells the story of a transnational marriage, culture shock, and child abduction. In 2015 he published &quot;Embedded Racism: Japan&#x27;s Visible Minorities and Racial Discrimination&quot; through the Lexington Books imprint of Rowman &amp; Littlefield.

Arudou has published twice in &quot;Fodor&#x27;s Japan&quot; Travel Guide, in 2012 (Hokkaido Chapter) and 2014 (Hokkaido and Tohoku Chapters). He has also published academic papers in &quot;The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus&quot; and other peer-reviewed journals in the interdisciplinary field of Asia-Pacific Studies, and has contributed chapters to academic books published by Akashi Shoten (Tokyo) and Springer.

<doc id="521571" wikidata="Q1194557" url="?curid=521571" title="Laryngitis">
<text>Laryngitis is inflammation of the larynx (voice box). Symptoms often include a hoarse voice and may include fever, cough, pain in the front of the neck, and trouble swallowing. Typically, these last under 2 weeks.

== Causes ==
Laryngitis is categorized as acute if it lasts less than 3 weeks and chronic if symptoms last more than 3 weeks. Acute cases usually occur as part of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, other infections, and trauma such as from coughing or other causes. Chronic cases may occur due to smoking, tuberculosis, allergies, acid reflux, rheumatoid arthritis, or sarcoidosis. The underlying mechanism involves irritation of the vocal cords.

== Diagnosis ==
Concerning signs that may require further investigation include stridor, history of radiation therapy to the neck, trouble swallowing, duration of more than 3 weeks, and a history of smoking. If concerning signs are present. the vocal cords should be examined via laryngoscopy. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include epiglottitis, croup, inhaling a foreign body, and laryngeal cancer.

== Treatment and epidemiology ==
The acute form of the infection, or acute laryngitis, generally resolves without specific treatment. Resting the voice and sufficient fluids may help. Antibiotics generally do not appear to be useful in the acute form. The acute form is common while the chronic form of the infection, or chronic laryngitis, is not. Chronic laryngitis occurs most often in middle age and is more common in men than women.
==Signs and symptoms ==
The primary symptom of laryngitis is a hoarse voice. Because laryngitis can have various causes, other signs and symptoms may vary. They can include:
* Dry or sore throat
* Coughing (both a causal factor and a symptom of laryngitis)
* Frequent throat clearing
* Increased saliva production
* Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)
* Sensation of swelling in the area of the larynx (discomfort in the front of the neck)
* Globus pharyngeus (feeling like there is a lump in the throat)
* Cold or flu-like symptoms (which, like a cough, may also be a causal factor for laryngitis)
* Swollen lymph nodes in the throat, chest, or face
* Fever
* General muscle pain (myalgia)
* Shortness of breath, predominantly in children

=== Voice quality ===
Aside from a hoarse-sounding voice, changes to pitch and volume may occur with laryngitis. Speakers may experience a lower or higher pitch than normal, depending on whether their vocal folds are swollen or stiff. They may also have breathier voices, as more air flows through the space between the vocal folds (the glottis), quieter volume, and a reduced range.

==Causes==

Laryngitis can be infectious as well as noninfectious in origin. The resulting inflammation of the vocal folds results in a distortion of the sound produced there. It normally develops in response to either an infection, trauma to the vocal folds, or allergies. Chronic laryngitis may also be caused by more severe problems, such as nerve damage, sores, and polyps, or hard and thick lumps (nodules) on the vocal cords.

=== Acute ===

==== Viral ====
* Most acute cases of laryngitis are caused by viral infections, the most common of which tend to be rhinovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In patients who have a compromised immune system, other viruses such as herpes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may also be potential causes.

==== Bacterial ====
* This is another major cause of acute laryngitis, and it may develop in conjunction with or due to a bacterial infection. Common bacterial strains are group A streptococcus, &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot;, &quot;M. catarrhalis&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot;, &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;, , and &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;. In developing countries, more unusual bacterial cases may occur, such as mycobacterial and syphilitic, though these may occur in developed nations as well.

==== Fungal ====
* Laryngitis caused by fungal infection is common but not frequently diagnosed according to a review by BMJ and can account for up to 10% of acute laryngitis cases. Patients with both functioning and impaired immune systems can develop fungal laryngitis, which may develop as a result of recent antibiotic or inhaled corticosteroids use. Certain strains of fungi that may cause laryngitis include, &quot;Histoplasma&quot;, &quot;Blastomyces&quot;, &quot;Candida&quot; (especially in immunocompromised persons), &quot;Cryptococcus,&quot; and &quot;Coccidioides&quot;.

==== Trauma ====
* Trauma is often due to excessive use of the vocal folds such as by yelling, screaming, or singing. Though this often results in damage to the outer layers of the vocal folds, the subsequent healing process may lead to changes in the physiology of the folds. Another potential cause of inflammation may be overuse of the vocal cords. Laryngeal trauma, including iatrogenic (caused by endotracheal intubation), can also result in inflammation of the vocal cords.

=== Chronic ===

==== Allergies ====
* Findings are unclear as to whether asthma may cause symptoms commonly associated with laryngitis. Some researchers have posited that allergic causes of laryngitis are often misdiagnosed as being the result of acid reflux.

==== Reflux ====
* One possible explanation of chronic laryngitis is that inflammation is caused by gastro-esophageal reflux, which causes subsequent irritation of the vocal folds.

==== Autoimmune disorders ====
* Between approximately 30 and 75% of persons with rheumatoid arthritis report symptoms of laryngitis.
* Symptoms of laryngitis are present in only 0.5–5% of people that have sarcoidosis. According to a meta-analysis by Silva et al. (2007), this disease is often an uncommon cause of laryngeal symptoms and is frequently misdiagnosed as another voice disorder.

=== Diagnosis ===
Diagnosis of different forms of acute laryngitis include:
* Laryngitis following trauma: This form of laryngitis is usually identified by obtaining a case history providing information on previous phono-traumatic experiences, internal trauma caused by recent procedures as well as any previous neck injuries.
* Acute viral laryngitis: This form of laryngitis is characterized by lower vocal pitch as well as hoarseness. The symptoms in this form of laryngitis are usually present for less than 1 week, however they can persist for 3–4 weeks. This form of laryngitis might also be accompanied by upper respiratory tract symptoms such as sore throat, odynophagia, rhinorrhea, dyspnea, postnasal discharge, and congestion.
* Fungal laryngitis: A biopsy and culture of an abnormal lesion may help confirm fungal laryngitis.

=== Visual diagnosis ===
The larynx itself will often show erythema (reddening) and edema (swelling). This can be seen with laryngoscopy or stroboscopy (method depends on the type of laryngitis). Stroboscopy may be relatively normal or may reveal asymmetry, aperiodicity, and reduced mucosal wave patterns.

Other features of the laryngeal tissues may include
* Redness of the laryngeal tissues (acute)
* Dilated blood vessels (acute)
* Thick, yet dry laryngeal tissue (chronic)
* Stiff vocal folds
* Sticky secretions between the vocal folds and nearby structures (the interarytenoid region)

=== Referral ===
Some signs and symptoms indicate the need for early referral. These include:
* Difficulty swallowing
* Vocal stridor
* Ear pain
* Recent weight loss
* History of smoking
* Current or recent radiotherapy treatment (in the neck region)
* Recent neck surgery or surgery involving endotracheal tubing
* Person is a professional voice user (teacher, singer, actor, call center worker, etc.)

===Differential diagnosis===
* Acute epiglottitis: This is more likely in those with stridor, drooling, and painful or trouble swallowing.
* Spasmodic dysphonia
* Reflux laryngitis
* Chronic allergic laryngitis
* Neoplasm
* Croup: This presents with a barking cough, hoarseness of voice, and inspiratory stridor.

==Treatment==
Treatment is often supportive in nature, and depends on the severity and type of laryngitis (acute or chronic). General measures to relieve symptoms of laryngitis include behavior modification, hydration, and humidification.

Vocal hygiene (care of the voice) is very important to relieve symptoms of laryngitis. Vocal hygiene involves measures such as resting the voice, drinking sufficient water, reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, stopping smoking, and limiting throat clearing.

=== Acute laryngitis ===
In general, acute laryngitis treatment involves vocal hygiene, painkillers (analgesics), humidification, and antibiotics.

==== Viral ====
The suggested treatment for viral laryngitis involves vocal rest, pain medication, and mucolytics for frequent coughing. Home remedies such as tea and honey may also be helpful. Antibiotics are not used for treatment of viral laryngitis.

==== Bacterial ====
Antibiotics may be prescribed for bacterial laryngitis, especially when symptoms of upper respiratory infection are present. However, the use of antibiotics is highly debated for acute laryngitis. This relates to issues of effectiveness, side effects, cost, and possibility of antibiotic resistance patterns. Overall, antibiotics do not appear to be very effective in the treatment of acute laryngitis.

In severe cases of bacterial laryngitis, such as supraglottitis or epiglottitis, there is a higher risk of the airway becoming blocked. An urgent referral to a physician should be made to manage the airway. Treatment may involve humidification, corticosteroids, intravenous antibiotics, and nebulised adrenaline.

==== Fungal ====
Fungal laryngitis can be treated with oral antifungal tablets and antifungal solutions. These are typically used for up to 3 weeks and treatment may need to be repeated if the fungal infection returns.

====Trauma====
Laryngitis caused by excessive use or misuse of the voice can be managed through vocal hygiene measures.

=== Chronic laryngitis ===

==== Reflux ====
Laryngopharyngeal reflux treatment primarily involves behavioral management and medication. Behavioral management involves aspects such as:
* Wearing loose clothing
* Eating smaller, more frequent meals
* Avoiding certain foods (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods)
Anti-reflux medications may be prescribed for patients with signs of chronic laryngitis and hoarse voice. If anti-reflux treatment does not result in a decrease of symptoms, other possible causes should be examined. Over-the-counter medications for neutralizing acids (antacids) and acid suppressants (H-2 blockers) may be used. Antacids are often short-acting and may not be sufficient for treatment. Proton pump inhibitors are an effective type of medication. These should only be prescribed for a set period of time, after which the symptoms should be reviewed. Proton pump inhibitors do not work for everyone. A physical reflux barrier (e.g., Gaviscon Liquid) may be more appropriate for some. Antisecretory medications (i.e., ulcers) can have several side-effects.

When appropriate, anti-reflux surgery may benefit some individuals.

==== Inflammatory ====
When treating allergic laryngitis, topical nasal steroids and immunotherapy have been found to be effective for allergic rhinitis. Antihistamines may also be helpful, but can create a dryness in the larynx. Inhaled steroids that are used for a long period can lead to problems with the larynx and voice.

==== Autoimmune ====
Mucous membrane pemphigoid may be managed with medication (cyclophosphamide and prednisolone).

==== Granulomatous ====
Sarcoidosis is typically treated with systemic corticosteroids. Less frequently used treatments include intralesional injections or laser resection.

==Prognosis==

=== Acute ===
Acute laryngitis may persist, but will typically resolve on its own within 2 weeks. Recovery is likely to be quick if the patient follows the treatment plan. In viral laryngitis, symptoms can persist for an extended period, even when upper respiratory tract inflammation has been resolved.

=== Chronic ===
Laryngitis that continues for more than 3 weeks is considered chronic. If laryngeal symptoms last for more than 3 weeks, a referral to a physician should be made for further examination, including direct laryngoscopy. The prognosis for chronic laryngitis varies depending on the cause of the laryngitis.

<text>The Rainbow Books are a collection of CD format specifications, generally written and published by the companies involved in their development, including Philips, Sony, Matsushita and JVC, among others.&lt;br&gt;

A number of these specifications have been officially adopted by established standards bodies, including the ISO, IEC, and ECMA.

==&quot;Red Book&quot; (1980) ==

*CD-DA (&quot;Digital Audio&quot;) – originally published by Philips and Sony in 1981, it was later standardized as IEC 60908:1987 and later IEC 60908:1999.
**CD-Text – a 1996 extension to CD-DA
**CD-MIDI – part of the original Red Book standard
**CD+G (&quot;plus Graphics&quot;) – an extension of the Red Book specifications used mainly for karaoke
***CD+EG / CD+XG (&quot;plus Extended Graphics&quot;) – an extension of CD+G

==&quot;Yellow Book&quot; (1983) ==

*CD-ROM (&quot;Read-Only Memory&quot;) – originally developed by Philips and Sony, it was standardized as ISO/IEC 10149 in 1988 and ECMA-130 in 1989
**CD-ROM XA (&quot;eXtended Architecture&quot;) – a 1991 extension of CD-ROM, developed by Philips and Sony 

==&quot;Green Book&quot; (1986) ==

*CD-i (&quot;Interactive&quot;) – standard developed and published by Phillips.

==&quot;Orange Book&quot; (1990) ==

Orange is a reference to the fact that red and yellow mix to orange. This correlates with the fact that CD-R and CD-RW are capable of audio (&quot;Red&quot;) and data (&quot;Yellow&quot;); although other colors (other CD standards) that do not mix are capable of being burned onto the physical medium. &quot;Orange Book&quot; also introduced the standard for multisession writing.
*CD-MO (&quot;Magneto-Optical&quot;) 
*CD-R (&quot;Recordable&quot;) alias CD-WO (&quot;Write Once&quot;) alias CD-WORM (&quot;Write Once, Read Many&quot;) – originally developed by Sony and Philips, it was partially standardized as ECMA-394.
*CD-RW (&quot;ReWritable&quot;) alias CD-E (&quot;Eraseable&quot;) – originally developed by Philips, Sony and Ricoh, it was partially standardized as ECMA-395.

==&quot;Beige Book&quot; (1992) ==

*Photo CD (&quot;Photo&quot;) — proprietary standard jointly developed by Philips and Eastman Kodak; never released to the public

==&quot;White Book&quot; (1993) ==

The &quot;White Book&quot; refers to a standard of compact disc that stores pictures and video.
*CD-i Bridge - a bridge format between CD-ROM XA and the Green Book CD-i, which is the base format for Video CDs, Super Video CDs and Photo CDs.
*VCD (&quot;Video&quot;) – a standard jointly developed and published by JVC, Matsushita, Philips and Sony.
**SVCD (&quot;Super Video&quot;, 1998) – a 1998 extension of VCD, standardized as IEC 62107 in 2000.

==&quot;Blue Book&quot; (1995) ==

The &quot;Blue Book&quot; is a compact disc standard that defines the Enhanced Music CD format, which combines audio tracks and data tracks on the same disc.
*E-CD/CD+/CD Extra (&quot;Enhanced&quot;) – a standard jointly developed and published by Microsoft, Philips and Sony

==&quot;Scarlet Book&quot; (1999) ==
Scarlet color of this book is a reference to the Red Book, which defines original CDDA.

*SACD (&quot;Super Audio&quot;) – a standard jointly developed and published by Philips and Sony

==&quot;Purple Book&quot; (2000) ==
A standard developed by Philips and Sony in the late 1990s, with over 1 GB in capacity and recordable/re-recordable capabilities.

*DDCD (&quot;Double Density&quot;) – divided in three separate specifications:
**DD-ROM (&quot;Double Density Read-Only&quot;)
**DD-R (&quot;Double Density Recordable&quot;)
**DD-RW (&quot;Double Density ReWritable&quot;)

==See also==
* ISO 9660, a 1986 filesystem standard used in conjunction with CD-ROM formats.
* &quot;Orange-Book-Standard&quot;, a decision named after the Compact Disc standard, issued in 2009 by the German Federal Court of Justice on the interaction between patent law and standards

<text>Brockley is a station on the main railway line between and , down the line from London Bridge. It is in Travelcard Zone 2. It is served by suburban services of London Overground (Windrush line) and National Rail (Southern). It is located in Brockley in south-east London.

==History==

The line was part of the London and Croydon Railway which opened in 1839. The station was opened on 6 March 1871. The station was demolished in the 1970s. Today&#x27;s buildings are largely early 1970s design. The platforms are only located on the outer, Slow lines, since the station is only served by London Overground trains between and or , local trains between London Bridge and Coulsdon Town and by the London Bridge to London Victoria loop line via Crystal Palace, plus some London Bridge to Guildford and in peak times.

Adjacent to Brockley station was sited station which closed to passengers in 1917 with the original London, Chatham and Dover Railway branch to Greenwich Park. The connection of that line to Lewisham is a later development. The possibility of opening platforms on this line with direct access to Victoria Station and the Bexleyheath Line to Dartford has often been suggested.

, on the to Sevenoaks line, and which also runs from Nunhead, is a mile to the south. Neither of these other lines has a physical connection with Brockley station, despite the trains running over the station. The next station to the north is , and the next station to the south is .

Brockley forms part of the new southbound extension of the East London line (now the Windrush line) that opened on 23 May 2010 and forms part of the London Overground network. Ticket barriers were installed at this time.

A proposal to create a new Brockley Interchange, linking the existing station to the to Lewisham line with new platforms at the former Brockley Lane station, is included in the London Borough of Lewisham&#x27;s 2019–2041 transport strategy. The document gives an approximate date of 2030 and states that funding from TfL and Network Rail would be needed for the project. The document states that TFL is to provide an estimated cost.

==Services==
Brockley is on the Windrush line of the London Overground, with services operated using EMUs. Additional services are operated by Southern using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 2 tph to 
* 8 tph to via (Windrush line)
* 2 tph to via 
* 4 tph to (Windrush line)
* 4 tph to (Windrush line)

The station is also served by a single early morning and late evening service to via , with the early morning service continuing to and .

==Connections==
London Buses routes 171, 172, 484 and night route N171 serve the station.

<text>Gladstone () is a coastal city in the Gladstone Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the Gladstone urban area had a population of 45,185 people.

It is by road north-west of the state capital, Brisbane, and south-east of Rockhampton. Situated between the Calliope and Boyne Rivers, Gladstone is home to Queensland&#x27;s largest multi-commodity shipping port, the Port of Gladstone.

Gladstone is the largest town within the Gladstone Region and the headquarters of Gladstone Regional Council is located in Gladstone.

== History ==
Before European settlement, the Gladstone region was home of the Gooreng Gooreng, Toolooa (or Tulua), Meerooni and Baiali (or Byellee) Aboriginal tribes.

In May 1770, , under the command of James Cook, sailed by the entrance to Gladstone Harbour under the cover of darkness. Matthew Flinders, during his 1801–1803 circumnavigation of Australia, became the first recorded European to sight the harbour in August 1802. He named the harbour Port Curtis, after Admiral Roger Curtis, a man who was of assistance to Flinders a year earlier at the Cape of Good Hope. John Oxley conducted further exploration of the harbour and surrounding countryside in November 1823. Oxley was dismissive of the region, noting the harbour was difficult to enter, the countryside was too dry, and the timber useless for construction purposes.

Nevertheless, in 1847 the British attempted to establish the new colony of North Australia at Port Curtis. Colonel George Barney was chosen to lead this experiment in colonisation and his expedition was eventful. On 25 January 1847, the &quot;Lord Auckland&quot;, carrying 87 soldiers and convicts, arrived off the southern entrance of Port Curtis and promptly ran aground on shoals off the southern tip of Facing Island. The settlers spent seven weeks on the island before being rescued by the supply ship &quot;Thomas Lowry&quot; and delivered the intended site of settlement, the region now known as Barney Point. On 30 January at a proclamation ceremony at Settlement Point on Facing Island, Barney was sworn in as Lieutenant Governor of the (already revoked) colony of North Australia. The convict settlement lasted barely two months and cost the Imperial government £15,000. A change of government in Britain ordered the withdrawal of Barney and the settlers.

By 1853, Francis MacCabe was surveying the site of a new town on the shores of Port Curtis under the protection of several detachments of Native Police. Maurice O&#x27;Connell was appointed government resident the following year, resulting in an influx of free settlers as land became available throughout the region.

Gladstone State School opened on 1 April 1861 and is one of the oldest state primary schools in Queensland. On 14 November 1968 it was renamed Gladstone Central State School.

In 1863, the town became a Municipality with Richard Hetherington elected Gladstone&#x27;s first mayor. The fledgling town was named after the British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone and has a 19th-century marble statue on display in its town museum.

Development of Gladstone was slow until 1893 when a meatworks was established at Parsons Point.

Parson&#x27;s Point Provisional School opened on 1 August 1898, becoming Parson&#x27;s Point State School on 1 February 1913. The school was relocated and renamed Gladstone South State School in 1945.

On 2 March 1949, a major cyclone hit Gladstone, resulting in extensive damage to the town.

Gladstone State High School opened on 2 February 1953.

In 1963, Queensland Alumina Limited established its alumina refinery on the site of the old meatworks. Gladstone&#x27;s port facilities were expanded and the city launched into an era of industrial development and economic prosperity.

Gladstone West State School opened on 24 January 1966.

Rosella Park State School was opened on 17 May 1971.

Clinton State School opened on 29 January 1974.

Toolooa State High School opened on 27 January 1981.

Kin Kora State School opened on 9 October 1981.

In 1985 the Gladstone Christian Community School opened as a primary school operated by the Gladstone Baptist Church. In 1998, it changed its name to Trinity College. From 2013 it offered classes from Prep to Year 12.

St Stephens Lutheran College opened in 1998, but closed at the end of 2016. The school had lost 20% of its enrolment due to families moving away to find work, leaving only 216 students in classes ranging from Prep to Year 12 making it no longer viable to operate the school.

Gladstone Cinemas, a locally owned and operated independent cinema, opened in March 2001.

The Gladstone Library building opened in 2003.

Gladstone&#x27;s primary industries are mining-related. The Port of Gladstone is the fifth-largest multi-commodity port in Australia and the world&#x27;s fourth-largest coal-exporting terminal. The port consists of a number of wharves and terminal facilities. Boyne Wharf is used by the Boyne Island aluminium smelter and was opened in August 1982. The western harbour basin has been expanded, primarily to allow increased exports of liquified natural gas (LNG). Furthermore, in 2016, a plant was constructed on Curtis Island to produce and export LNG, a construction project that contributed heavily to city&#x27;s population and housing boom. Major exports include coal, alumina, aluminium, cement products, sodium cyanide and ammonium nitrate. Each year 50 million tonnes of coal passes through the port, making up 70% of the total exports.

Gladstone harbour is within the World Heritage Area of the Great Barrier Reef and has historically supported a thriving seafood industry. In August 2011, a Fisheries Queensland spokesman said they received reports of fish with milky eyes. A spokesman from the Gladstone Fish Markets claimed that diseased fish were still being caught in large numbers in November 2011. Losses to the local seafood industry have been estimated at A$36 million a year.

Gladstone is also a tourism destination, with cruise ships regularly docking at the port.

<text>(; &quot;The Power of Fate&quot;, often translated &quot;The Force of Destiny&quot;) is an Italian opera by Giuseppe Verdi. The libretto was written by Francesco Maria Piave based on a Spanish drama, &quot;&quot; (1835), by Ángel de Saavedra, 3rd Duke of Rivas, with a scene adapted from Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Wallensteins Lager&quot; (&quot;Wallenstein&#x27;s Camp&quot;). It was first performed in the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre of Saint Petersburg, Russia, on 29 October 1862 O.S. (N.S. 10 November).
&quot;&quot; is frequently performed, and there have been a number of complete recordings. In addition, the overture (to the revised version of the opera) is part of the standard repertoire for orchestras, often played as the opening piece at concerts.

==Performance history==
 
===Revisions===
After its premiere in Russia, &quot;La forza&quot; underwent some revisions and made its debut abroad with performances in Rome in 1863 under the title &quot;Don Alvaro&quot;. Performances followed in Madrid (with the Duke of Rivas, the play&#x27;s author, in attendance) and the opera subsequently travelled to New York, Vienna (1865), Buenos Aires (1866), and London (1867).
Following these productions, Verdi made further, more extensive revisions to the opera with additions to the libretto by Antonio Ghislanzoni. This version, which premiered at La Scala, Milan, on 27 February 1869, has become the standard performance version. The most important changes were a new overture (replacing a brief prelude); the addition of a final scene to act 3, following the duel between Carlo and Alvaro; and a new ending, in which Alvaro remains alive, instead of throwing himself off a cliff to his death. The opera in this version is frequently performed in the world&#x27;s opera houses today.

===Recent critical editions===
Critical editions of all versions of the opera (including material from the original 1861 score) have been prepared by musicologist Philip Gossett of the University of Chicago.
In November 2005, the critical edition of the 1869 version was first performed by the San Francisco Opera whose program book included an essay by Gossett on the evolution of the various versions: &quot;&quot;La forza del destino&quot;: Three States of One Opera&quot;. The Caramoor International Music Festival gave a concert performance of the critical edition of the 1862 version, plus never-performed vocal pieces from the 1861 version, in July 2008.

===Overture===
The music begins with the opera&#x27;s &quot;Fate&quot; motif, an ominous three note E unison in the brass.
===Act 1===
&quot;The mansion of Leonora&#x27;s family, in Seville&quot;
Don Alvaro, a young nobleman from South America (presumably Peru), has settled in Seville, Spain, where he is looked down on by many because of his Inca background. There, he and Donna Leonora, the daughter of the haughty Marchese di Calatrava, have fallen in love. But her father the Marchese violently opposes a match he feels is dishonorable and beneath her, believing her to have been seduced. Notwithstanding her tender regard for her father, who until now has always been kind to her, Leonora is ready to give up family and country in order to elope with Alvaro. Aided by her confidante, Curra (&quot;Me pellegrina ed orfana&quot; – &quot;Exiled and orphaned far from my childhood home&quot;), she prepares to leave.
When Alvaro arrives to fetch her, however, Leonora hesitates, begging for one last day with her father. Alvaro, stunned, releases her from their engagement, saying that she cannot love him as much as he loves her. Leonora then relents and they agree to escape as planned. At that moment the Marchese suddenly enters and discovers the couple together. Assuming the worst, he draws his weapons and threatens the young man with death. To remove any suspicion as to Leonora&#x27;s purity, Alvaro surrenders himself. As he flings down his pistol, it goes off, mortally wounding the Marchese, who dies, uttering a curse on his daughter. The horrified lovers rush out of the room.

===Act 2===
&quot;Scene 1: An inn in the village of Hornachuelos&quot;
About a year has passed since the death of the Marchese di Calatrava. In their flight, Leonora and Alvaro were separated and have lost track of each other, unable to reunite or learn of each other&#x27;s whereabouts.
The act opens in the crowded dining room of an inn, where the guests include the &quot;alcalde&quot; (town mayor) and several muleteers among others gathered in the dining room as dinner is about to be served. Leonora&#x27;s brother Don Carlo di Vargas then enters, bent on avenging the family honor and the death of his father. Carlo has disguised himself as a student from Salamanca by the name of Pereda. During the supper, Preziosilla, a pretty gypsy fortune teller, joins them and sings a song urging them to enlist in the army (&quot;Al suon del tamburo&quot; – &quot;When side drums rattle&quot;) for Italy&#x27;s freedom. Leonora arrives in male attire accompanied by Trabuco, a muleteer, on their way to a Franciscan monastery where Leonora plans to seek refuge. Recognizing her brother, who she knows wants to kill her, she hides. Carlo grills Trabuco about the identity of his traveling companion, but the company lets him know they don&#x27;t like his prying questions. They turn the tables by asking Carlo who he is. He claims to be a University student helping a friend track down the friend&#x27;s sister and her seducer, who, he claims has returned to his native America (&quot;Son Pereda son ricco d&#x27;onore&quot; – &quot;I am Pereda, of honorable descent&quot;). The gypsy girl laughs and says she doesn&#x27;t believe this story. Overhearing this, Leonora realizes that Alvaro is still alive. She concludes he has betrayed and abandoned her, and she slips away without being discovered.
&quot;Scene 2: A monastery nearby&quot;

Outside the monastery of the Madonna of Angels, Leonora, seeking sanctuary and solitary atonement, has come to take refuge in the monastery intending to live the rest of her life as a hermit &quot;(Son giunta! Grazie, o Dio!&quot;
&quot;Estremo asil quest&#x27;è per me! ... Madre, pietosa Vergine&quot;, – &quot;I&#x27;ve arrived! Thank heaven! My last resort and hope&quot;... &quot;Mother, merciful Virgin&quot;.) After a somewhat surly reception by Fra Melitone, she tells the abbot, Padre Guardiano, her true name and her wish to spend the remainder of her life in the monastery&#x27;s hermitage. The abbot recounts the trials she will have to undergo. Padre Guardiano agrees to direct her to a secret cave in the mountains, where he alone will bring her food and where she will find a bell which she is to ring only in times of great danger or if she is on the point of death. Leonora, Padre Guardiano, Fra Melitone, and the other monks join in prayer as she is formally accepted as tenant of the hermitage.

===Act 3===
&quot;Scene 1: A forest near Velletri, in Italy&quot;
Meanwhile, Alvaro, believing Leonora to be dead, has joined the Spanish army under the name of Don Federico Herreros and has distinguished himself for bravery (&quot;La vita è inferno all&#x27;infelice ... O tu che in seno agli angeli&quot; – &quot;Life is a hell to an unhappy man.&quot; ... &quot;Oh, you who dwell with the angels&quot;). He is interrupted by cries for help and rescues a man from two assassins. It is Don Carlo, who has newly joined the same regiment, also under an assumed name: Don Felix Bornos. The two become friends and march off side by side to fight in the Battle of Velletri, an historical event which occurred in 1744.
&quot;Scene 2: The officers&#x27; quarters&quot;
Alvaro is brought into the officers&#x27; quarters, gravely wounded in the chest. Thinking he is about to die, he entrusts the key to a casket to his friend &quot;Don Felix&quot; (Carlo). The box contains a packet of letters, which Alvaro says contain a secret. He makes his friend swear to burn them without reading them: (&quot;Solenne in quest&#x27;ora, giurarmi dovete far pago un mio voto&quot; – &quot;You must swear to me in this solemn hour, to carry out my wish.&quot;). Felix/Carlo assures Alvaro that he won&#x27;t die and that he will be decorated with the Order of Calatrava for his bravery. At the name Calatrava Alvaro shudders and exclaims, &quot;No!&quot;. Carlo is taken aback. He is afraid that &quot;Don Federico&quot; (Alvaro) may, in truth, be the mysterious seducer who killed his father. He resolves to look at the letters to settle his doubts. (&quot;Morir! Tremenda cosa! ... Urna fatale del mio destino&quot; – &quot;To die! An immense thing... Begone, fatal vessel of my destiny!&quot;). As his wounded friend is taken away on the surgeon&#x27;s stretcher, he opens the casket, finds his sister&#x27;s portrait, and realizes Alvaro&#x27;s true identity. At that moment a surgeon brings word that Don Alvaro may recover. Don Carlo exults at the prospect of avenging his father&#x27;s death.

&quot;Scene 3: A camp near the battleground&quot;
Having recovered, Alvaro is confronted by Carlo. They begin to duel, but are pulled away from each other by the soldiers. As they restrain Carlo, the anguished Don Alvaro vows to enter a monastery.
The soldiers gather. Trabucco, the peddler, tries to sell them his wares; Fra Melitone chastises them for their godless ways; and Preziosilla leads them in a chorus in praise of the military life (&quot;Rataplan, rataplan, della gloria&quot; – &quot;Rum-tum-tum on the drum is the music that makes a soldier&#x27;s martial spirit rise&quot;).

===Act 4===
&quot;Scene 1: The monastery&quot;
Impoverished peasants from the region approach Fra Melitone at the monastery at Hornachuelos for food and Padre Guardiano gently scolds Melitone for his less than charitable behavior towards them. Don Carlo then approaches, having learned of the presence of Don Alvaro there. Under the name of Father Raphael, Alvaro has indeed entered the monastery, near which is Leonora&#x27;s cave. Alvaro offers peace, but when Carlo taunts him as a half-breed Alvaro takes up the challenge and the two rush from the monastery. (&quot;Le minacce, i fieri accenti&quot; – &quot;May the winds carry off with them&quot;).
&quot;Scene 2: A desolate spot near Leonora&#x27;s hermitage&quot;

Leonora, longing for the peaceful release of death, restates her love for Alvaro and begs God for peace. (&quot;Pace, pace, mio Dio!&quot; – &quot;Peace, O mighty Father, give me peace!&quot;). The duel between the two men spills over onto the neighboring crags in the vicinity of Leonora&#x27;s isolation. Upon hearing the clashing of swords she takes refuge in her cave. Carlo is mortally wounded by Alvaro, who invades the hermit&#x27;s sanctuary to request the last offices for the dying man. Leonora and Alvaro recognize each other. Alvaro tells her of what has happened, and she rushes to embrace her dying brother. As she bends over him, he stabs her in the heart. The Father Superior, who has come in answer to Leonora&#x27;s alarm bell, orders Alvaro to stop cursing fate and to humble himself before God. The dying Leonora joins him in this plea, and Alvaro declaims that he is now redeemed.
:[Original version: Overcome by the guilt at having killed or caused the death of all the Calatravas, Alvaro jumps to his death into the nearby ravine, cursing humankind, over the protests of Father Guardiano].
==Superstition==
Over the years &quot;La forza&quot; has acquired a reputation for being cursed, following some unfortunate incidents. In 1960 at the Metropolitan Opera, the noted baritone Leonard Warren collapsed and died during a performance of the opera. The supposed curse reportedly kept Luciano Pavarotti from ever performing the opera, and the tenor Franco Corelli used to follow small rituals during performances to avoid bad luck.

==Other media==
The main theme in the musical scores for the films &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; and &quot;Manon des Sources&quot; (both 1986) was adapted by Jean-Claude Petit from the duet &quot;Invano, Alvaro&quot; in &quot;La forza del destino&quot;. The Korean film &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (2004) opens with &quot;Pace, pace mio Dio&quot;, introducing a film about intensely powerful obsession which brings its lovers to the brink of madness. &quot;La forza del destino&quot; also plays a thematic role in the novel series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; (1999–2006).

<doc id="521577" wikidata="Q599898" url="?curid=521577" title="Cacique">
<text>A cacique, sometimes spelled as cazique (; ; feminine form: &#x27;), was a tribal chieftain of the Taíno people, who were the Indigenous inhabitants of the Bahamas, the Greater Antilles, and the northern Lesser Antilles at the time of European contact with those places. The term is a Spanish transliteration of the Taíno word &#x27;.

Cacique was initially translated as &quot;king&quot; or &quot;prince&quot; for the Spanish. In the colonial era, the conquistadors and the administrators who followed them used the word generically to refer to any leader of practically any indigenous group they encountered in the Western Hemisphere. In Hispanic and Lusophone countries, the term has also come to mean a political boss, similar to a &quot;caudillo,&quot; exercising power in a system of caciquism.

==Spanish colonial-era caciques==
The Taíno word descends from the Taíno word , which means &quot;to keep house&quot;. In 1555 the word first entered the English language, defined as &quot;prince&quot;. In Taíno culture, the rank was hereditary and sometimes established through democratic means. As the Taínos were mostly a peaceable culture the &quot;kasike&quot;&#x27;s importance in the tribe was determined by the size of his clan rather than his skills in warfare. The Taíno &quot;kasikes&quot; also enjoyed several privileges that marked them as the elite class of Taíno society: they lived in a larger rectangular hut in the center of the village, rather than the peripheral circular huts of other villagers, and they had reserved places from which to view the &quot;areítos&quot; (ceremonial dances) and ceremonial ball game. Most importantly, the &quot;kasike&quot;&#x27;s word was law and they exercised this power to oversee a sophisticated government, finely involved with all aspects of social existence.

The Spanish transliterated &quot;kasike&quot; and used the term (cacique) to refer to the local leader of essentially any indigenous group in Spanish America. Caribbean caciques who did not initially oppose the Spanish became middlemen, serving as the interface between their communities and the Spanish. Their cooperation was frequently provisional. Most of the early caciques eventually revolted, resulting in their deaths in battle or by execution. Two of the most famous of these early colonial-era caciques are Hatuey from what is now Cuba and Enriquillo on the island of Hispaniola. Both are now respective national heroes in Cuba and the Dominican Republic.

The Spanish had more success when they drafted the leaders of the far more hierarchically organized indigenous civilizations of Central Mexico. These Central Mexican caciques served as more effective, and loyal, intermediaries in the new system of colonial rule. The hierarchy and nomenclature of indigenous leadership usually survived within a given community and the Spaniards&#x27; designation of caciques did not usually correspond to the hereditary or likely candidate from a given system of indigenous leadership.

As a consequence, elite indigenous men willing to cooperate with the colonial rulers replaced their rivals who had better hereditary or traditional claims on leadership. The Spanish recognized indigenous nobles as a European-style nobility, within the newly established colonial system and a cacique&#x27;s status among the colonizers (along with that of his family) was buttressed by their being permitted the Spanish noble honorifics &quot;don&quot; and &quot;doña&quot;.

As colonial middlemen, caciques were often the first to introduce European material culture to their communities. This is seen in the Spanish-style houses they built, the Spanish furnishings that filled them and the European fashions they wore everywhere. They engaged in Spanish commercial enterprises such as sheep and cattle ranchers and sericulture. Many even owned enslaved Africans to operate these concerns. The caciques also acquired new privileges, unknown before contact. These included the right to carry swords or firearms and to ride horses or mules. Some caciques had entailed estates called cacicazgos. The records of many of these Mexican estates are held in the Mexican national archives in a section &quot;Vínculos&quot; (&quot;entails&quot;). The establishment of Spanish-style town government (&quot;cabildos)&quot; served as a mechanism to supplant traditional rule. Spanish manipulation of &quot;cabildo&quot; elections placed compliant members of the traditional, hereditary lineages on such &quot;cabildos&quot; town councils.

By the late colonial era in central Mexico, the term cacique had lost any dynastic meaning, with one scholar noting that &quot;cacique status could in some degree buttress a family&#x27;s prestige, but it could no longer in itself be regarded as a rank of major authority.&quot; In a 1769 petition by a cacique family to the Viceroy of New Spain, appealing for the restoration of its privileges, the following expectations were listed: &quot;that, the cacique should be seated separately from commoners at public functions; he was excused from serving in town government; he was exempted from tribute and other exactions; he was excused from Sunday worship and payments of the half &quot;real;&quot; his servants were not liable for community labor; he was exempt from incarceration for debt and his property from sequestration; he could be imprisoned for serious crime but not in the public jail; the caciques&#x27; names were to be listed among the nobles in official registers; and &quot;all these privileges are to apply equally to the caciques&#x27; wives and widows.&quot; With Mexican independence in 1821, the last of the special privileges of colonial-era caciques were finally abolished.

In contrast to the rest of the Spanish Colonial Americas, in the Andean region the local term &quot;kuraka&quot; was preferred to cacique. After conquering the Inca Empire the Spaniards administering the new Peruvian viceroyalty had allowed the &quot;kurakas&quot; or caciques to maintain their titles of nobility and perquisites of local rule so long as they swore fealty to the Spanish monarch.

In 1781, the Tīpac Amaru rebellion was led by a &quot;kuraka&quot; who claimed to be a descendant of the Inca royal line, that of the final Inca, Túpac Amaru. At independence in 1825, Simón Bolívar abolished noble titles, but the power and prestige of the &quot;kurakas&quot; were already in decline following the Great Rebellion. &quot;Kuraka&quot; rebellions had been waged since the beginning of the Spanish colonial rule, and decades after Túpac Amaru II&#x27;s 1781 uprising other insurrections such as the Túpac Katari or the Mateo Pumakawa uprisings were often the first major engagements of the South American Wars of Independence.

== Cacicas in colonial Mexico ==
Cacicas played significant roles as female leaders and entrepreneurs within indigenous Mexican communities. These women held titles independently, distinct from their husbands, and did not lose their status if they married outside their rank. Cacicas possessed financial insight, engaging in business transactions like property dealings and managing financial networks. They owned valuable assets including land, homes, and livestock, often securing the best and most fertile territories. 

Despite their entrepreneurial focus, cacicas also wielded considerable authority, acknowledged by native communities, the Spanish Crown, and the Catholic Church. Their status rivaled high-ranking Spanish men, with privileges like special treatment at religious ceremonies and even distinguished burial sites. This recognition extended beyond their ancestors, surpassing the rank of notable figures such as Isabel Moctezuma and her lineage. 

The multifaceted roles of cacicas highlight their integral contributions to Mexican society under Spanish rule, demonstrating their adeptness in economic enterprise, societal leadership, and cultural influence across indigenous communities.

==&quot;Caciquismo&quot; and &quot;caudillismo&quot;==
An extension of the term cacique, &quot;caciquismo&quot; (&quot;boss rule&quot;) can refer to a political system dominated by the power of local political bosses, the caciques. In the post-independence period in Mexico, the term retained its meaning of &quot;indigenous&quot; leaders, but also took on a more general usage of a &quot;local&quot; or &quot;regional&quot; leader as well. Some scholars make a distinction between &quot;caudillos&quot; (political strongmen) and their rule, &quot;caudillismo&quot;, and caciques and &quot;caciquismo&quot;. One Argentine intellectual, Carlos Octavio Bunge viewed &quot;caciquismo&quot; as emerging from anarchy and political disruption and then evolving into a &quot;pacific&quot; form of &quot;civilized caciquismo&quot;, such as Mexico&#x27;s Porfirio Díaz (r. 1876–1911). Argentine writer Fernando N.A. Cuevillas views &quot;caciquismo&quot; as being &quot;nothing more than a special brand of tyrant&quot;.

In Spain, &quot;caciquismo&quot; appeared in the late 19th-century and early 20th-century Spain. 
Writer Ramón Akal González views Galicia in northwest of Spain, as having remained in a continual state of strangulated growth over centuries as a result of &quot;caciquismo&quot; and nepotism. &quot;Galicia still suffers from this anachronistic caste of caciques.&quot; Spanish strongman El Caudillo Francisco Franco (1892-1975) was born in Ferrol in Galicia.

In the Philippines, the term &quot;cacique democracy&quot; was coined by Benedict Anderson. It has been used to describe the political system where in many parts of the country local leaders remain very strong, with almost warlord-type powers. The Philippines was a colony of Spain from the late sixteenth century until the Spanish–American War of 1898, when the United States assumed control. The U.S. administration subsequently introduced many commercial, political and administrative reforms. They were sometimes quite progressive and directed towards the modernization of government and commerce in the Philippines. However, the local traditional Filipino elites, being better educated and better connected than much of the local population, were often able to take advantage of the changes to bolster their positions.

There is no consensus in the scholarly literature about the origins of &quot;caciquismo&quot;. Murdo J. MacLeod suggests that the terms cacique and &quot;caudillo&quot; &quot;either require further scrutiny or, perhaps, they have become so stretched by the diversity of explanations and processes packed into them that they have become somewhat empty generalizations&quot;.

<text>The World Single Distances Speed Skating Championships are a series of speed skating competitions organised by the International Skating Union.

==History==
Since the late 19th century, speed skating championships were always decided by racing multiple distances – four different distances for the Allround Championships, and two different distances (which have to be skated twice) for Sprint Championships. However, the speed skating events at the Olympic Games were always individual distances, no medals are awarded for a combined event (the only exception being the 1924 Winter Olympics).

Towards the end of the 20th century, skaters started to specialize and it became rare that a skater was able to dominate both the short and the long distances. Perhaps the last skater able to do so was Eric Heiden, who won all five distances at the 1980 Winter Olympics. As a consequence of this specialization, the difference between the Olympic Games and the regular championships, and the popularity of both the Speed skating World Cup and Single Distance Championships held nationally in several countries, the International Skating Union decided to organise the World Single Distance Championships.

Starting in 1996, this originally was an annual event, but in 1998 it became clear that having World Single Distance Championships and the Single Distance Championships as held at the Winter Olympics during the same year was too much, so since 1999, the World Single Distance Championships are no longer held in (Winter) Olympic years.

==Distances==

The skaters compete in the following distances:

<doc id="521583" wikidata="Q320291" url="?curid=521583" title="Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey">
<text>Henry George Grey, 3rd Earl Grey (28 December 18029 October 1894), known as Viscount Howick from 1807 until 1845, was an English statesman and cabinet minister in the government of the United Kingdom.

==Background==
Grey was the eldest son of Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, who served as Prime Minister in the 1830s, by his wife The Honorable Mary Ponsonby, daughter of William Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby.

He matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1821, graduating with a nobleman&#x27;s MA in 1823.

==Political career==
He entered parliament in 1826, under the title of Viscount Howick, as Whig member for Winchelsea, and then briefly for Higham Ferrers before settling for a northern constituency. Northumberland in 1831 was followed by North Northumberland after the Great Reform Act 1832. He remained in the parliaments dominated by his party and later by Lord Melbourne as Prime Minister.

On the accession of the Whigs to power in 1830, when his father became prime minister, he was made Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. This gave him responsibility for Britain&#x27;s colonial possessions and laid the foundation of his intimate acquaintance with colonial questions. He belonged at the time to the more advanced party of colonial reformers, sharing the views of Edward Gibbon Wakefield on questions of land and emigration, and resigned in 1834 from dissatisfaction that slave emancipation was made gradual instead of immediate. In 1835 he entered Lord Melbourne&#x27;s cabinet as Secretary at War, and effected some valuable administrative reforms, especially by suppressing malpractices detrimental to the troops in India. After the partial reconstruction of the ministry in 1839, he again resigned, disapproving of the more advanced views of some of his colleagues.

These repeated resignations gave him a reputation for crotchetiness, which he did not decrease by his disposition to embarrass his old colleagues by his action on free trade questions in the session of 1841.

After being returned unopposed at the first three general elections in Northern division of Northumberland, Howick was defeated at the 1841 general election. He returned to the Commons after a few months absence, when he was elected for the borough of Sunderland at by-election in September 1841.

During the exile of the Liberals from power he went still farther on the path of free trade, and anticipated Lord John Russell&#x27;s declaration against the corn laws. When, on Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s resignation in December 1845, Lord John Russell was called upon to form a ministry, Howick, who had become Earl Grey by the death of his father in the preceding July, refused to enter the new cabinet if Lord Palmerston were foreign secretary. He was greatly censured for perverseness, and particularly when in the following July he accepted Lord Palmerston as a colleague without remonstrance. His conduct, nevertheless, afforded Lord John Russell an escape from an embarrassing situation.

Becoming colonial secretary in 1846, he found himself everywhere confronted with arduous problems, which in the main he encountered with success. His administration formed an epoch. He was the first minister to proclaim that the colonies were to be governed for their own benefit and not for the mother countries; the first systematically to accord them self-government so far as then seemed possible; the first to introduce free trade into their relations with Great Britain and Ireland. The concession by which colonies were allowed to tax imports from the mother-country &quot;ad libitum&quot; was not his; he protested against it, but was overruled. In the West Indies he suppressed, if he could not overcome, discontent; in Ceylon he put down rebellion; in New Zealand he suspended the constitution he had himself accorded, and yielded everything into the hands of Sir George Grey. The least successful part of his administration was his treatment of the convict question at the Cape of Good Hope, which seemed an exception to his rule that the colonies were to be governed for their own benefit and in accordance with their own wishes, and subjected him to a humiliating defeat.

Frustrated that plans for a loan to relieve the Irish famine and fund emigration schemes from the area had failed, Grey developed his plans for an alternative currency system to the Bank of England central bank model. It became known as a currency board, and he set up the first one in cooperation with James Wilson and the Mauritian colonial government in Mauritius.

His principal parliamentary appearances were when he moved for a committee on Irish affairs in 1866, and when in 1878 he passionately opposed the policy of the Beaconsfield cabinet in India. He nevertheless supported Lord Beaconsfield at the dissolution, regarding William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s accession to power with much greater alarm. He was a determined opponent of Gladstone&#x27;s Home rule policy.

He sponsored an emigration scheme for Irish women to Australia. The Earl Grey Scheme operated between 1848 and 1850. Under it more than 4000 Irish orphan girls from Irish workhouses were shipped to Australia under an assisted passage scheme, in an effort to solve Australia&#x27;s gender imbalance at that time and to aid in addressing the Irish famine and poverty.

In 1848 Grey was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council representing the City of Melbourne despite never visiting the colony; his seat was declared vacant in 1850 due to his non-attendance. This election was a protest against rule from Sydney and in 1850 Grey introduced the Australian Colonies Government Act which separated the district from New South Wales to become the colony of Victoria.

He resigned with his colleagues in February 1852. No room was found for him in the Aberdeen ministry formed in December that year, and although during the Crimean struggle public opinion pointed to him as the fittest man as minister for war, he never again held office. 

During the remainder of his long life he exercised a vigilant criticism on public affairs. He wrote a history and defence of his colonial policy in the form of letters to Lord John Russell (&quot;Colonial Policy of Lord John Russell&#x27;s Administration&quot;, 1853). In it, he states that &quot;if it is desired that the elected body should not be a representation of a single interest and a single class of opinions,&quot; cumulative voting or proportional representation should be adopted. 

In 1858 he wrote a work (republished in 1864) on parliamentary reform (the need for proportional representation and minority representation). In 1888 he wrote another on the state of Ireland and in 1892 one on the United States tariff. In his latter years he was a frequent contributor of weighty letters to The Times on land, tithes, currency and other public questions. 

==Family==
Lord Grey married on 9 August 1832, to Maria, daughter of Sir Joseph Copley, 3rd Baronet of Sprotborough. They had no children. She died in September 1879. Lord Grey survived her by fifteen years and died on 9 October 1894, aged 91. He was succeeded in the earldom by his nephew, Albert Grey (born 1851). 

==Legacy==
He was author of several books, including:

- Colonial Policy of the Administration of Lord John Russell (1853)

- Parliamentary government considered with reference to a reform of Parliament (1858)

- Parliamentary government considered with reference to a reform of Parliament. A new edition containing suggestions for improvement of our representative system...(1864)

The suburb of Howick in Auckland, New Zealand, is named after the earl.

<doc id="521586" wikidata="Q696488" url="?curid=521586" title="Kawanishi H6K">
<text>The Kawanishi H6K was an Imperial Japanese Navy flying boat produced by the Kawanishi Aircraft Company and used during World War II for maritime patrol duties. The Allied reporting name for the type was Mavis; the Navy designation was .
Developed in the 1930s, it was used for reconnaissance, transport, bombing, naval warfare, and executive transport by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The national airline also used it as commercial airliner. The British mistakenly identified this aircraft as the Kawanishi Navy 97 Mavis.

==Design and development==

The aircraft was designed in response to a Navy requirement of 1934 for a long-range flying boat and incorporated knowledge gleaned by a Kawanishi team that visited the Short Brothers factory in the UK, at that time one of the world&#x27;s leading producers of flying boats, and from building the Kawanishi H3K, a license-built, enlarged version of the Short Rangoon. The &quot;Type S&quot;, as Kawanishi called it, was a large, four-engined monoplane with twin tails, and a hull suspended beneath the parasol wing by a network of struts. Three prototypes were constructed, each one making gradual refinements to the machine&#x27;s handling both in the water and in the air, and finally fitting more powerful engines. The first of these flew on 14 July 1936 and was originally designated &quot;Navy Type 97 Flying Boat&quot;, later H6K. Eventually, 217 were built.

=== Production &amp; engines ===
Four prototypes were produced leading to the production version, with ten H6K2 built, then 124 H6K4 were produced which had better fuel capacity. All H6K were powered by 4 radial piston engines of different types. Some aircraft were upgraded with the 1000 hp Kinsei 46, and the H6K5 had the 1300 hp Kinsei 51/53.

The H6K prototype was powered by four 9-cylinder Nakajima Hikari 2 with 840 hp. 

Additionally production:

* Sixteen H6K2-L unarmed transports
* Two (2) H6K4-L VIP transports
* Twenty (20) H6K4-L unarmed transports with the Kinsei 46 engines
* Thirty-six H6K5s with Kinsei 51/53
Sixteen (16) aircraft were civilian air transports operated by Dai-Nippon Airways (the Imperial Japanese National airline), with on board toilet, galley, and room for 18 passengers. They had civil registration and were used for mail and passenger service to the Pacific. 

Combat H6K were armed with various combinations of Type 92 machine guns, and it could also carry two torpedoes or 1000kg of bombs.

==Operational history==

H6Ks were deployed from 1938 onwards, first seeing service in the Sino-Japanese War and were in widespread use when the Pacific War began in December 1941. At the start of the war, four &quot;Kōkūtai&quot; (naval air groups) operated a total of 66 H6K4s. Also, sixteen were used by the Imperial Japanese airline for mail and passenger service to the Pacific.

On 12 December 1941, during the Battle of Wake Island, an H6K bombed Wake island, but it was shot down by an F4F Wildcat.

On 15 February 1942, a P-40 Warhawk intercepted an H6K, about 190 km west of Darwin, Australia, which had attacked Allied shipping; both the P-40 and H6K were shot down.

The type had some success over Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific. H6Ks had excellent endurance, flying up to 24-hour patrols, and were often used for long-range reconnaissance and bombing missions. From bases in the Dutch East Indies, they could fly over a large portion of Australia.

However, the H6K became vulnerable to a newer generation of more heavily armed and faster fighter aircraft. In front-line service, it was replaced by the Kawanishi H8K. It continued in service throughout the war but in areas where the risk of interception was low.

<text>WinFS (short for Windows Future Storage) was the code name for a canceled data storage and management system project based on relational databases, developed by Microsoft and first demonstrated in 2003. It was intended as an advanced storage subsystem for the Microsoft Windows operating system, designed for persistence and management of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.

WinFS includes a relational database for storage of information, and allows any type of information to be stored in it, provided there is a well defined schema for the type. Individual data items could then be related together by relationships, which are either inferred by the system based on certain attributes or explicitly stated by the user. As the data has a well defined schema, any application can reuse the data; and using the relationships, related data can be effectively organized as well as retrieved. Because the system knows the structure and intent of the information, it can be used to make complex queries that enable advanced searching through the data and aggregating various data items by exploiting the relationships between them.
While WinFS and its shared type schema make it possible for an application to recognize the different data types, the application still has to be coded to render the different data types. Consequently, it would not allow development of a single application that can view or edit all data types; rather, WinFS enables applications to understand the structure of all data and extract the information that they can use further. When WinFS was introduced at the 2003 Professional Developers Conference, Microsoft also released a video presentation, named IWish, showing mockup interfaces that showed how applications would expose interfaces that take advantage of a unified type system. The concepts shown in the video ranged from applications using the relationships of items to dynamically offer filtering options to applications grouping multiple related data types and rendering them in a unified presentation.

WinFS was billed as one of the pillars of the &quot;Longhorn&quot; wave of technologies, and would ship as part of the next version of Windows. It was subsequently decided that WinFS would ship after the release of Windows Vista, but those plans were shelved in June 2006, with some of its component technologies being integrated into ADO.NET and Microsoft SQL Server.

==Motivation==
Many filesystems found on common operating systems, including the NTFS filesystem which is used in modern versions of Microsoft Windows, store files and other objects only as a stream of bytes, and have little or no information about the data stored in the files. Such file systems also provide only a single way of organizing the files, namely via directories and file names.

Because a file system has no knowledge about the data it stores, applications tend to use their own, often proprietary, file formats. This hampers sharing of data between multiple applications. It becomes difficult to create an application which processes information from multiple file types, because the programmers have to understand the structure and semantics of all the files. Using common file formats is a workaround to this problem but not a universal solution; there is no guarantee that all applications will use the format. Data with standardized schema, such as XML documents and relational data fare better, as they have a standardized structure and run-time requirements.

Also, a traditional file system can retrieve and search data based only on the filename, because the only knowledge it has about the data is the name of the files that store the data. A better solution is to tag files with attributes that describe them. Attributes are metadata about the files such as the type of file (such as &quot;document&quot;, &quot;picture&quot;, &quot;music&quot;, &quot;creator&quot;, etc.). This allows files to be searched for by their attributes, in ways not possible using a folder hierarchy, such as finding &quot;pictures which have person X&quot;. The attributes can be recognizable by either the file system natively, or via some extension. Desktop search applications take this concept a step further. They extract data, including attributes, from files and index it. To extract the data, they use a filter for each file format. This allows for searching based on both the file&#x27;s attributes and the data in it.

However, this still does not help in managing related data, as disparate items do not have any relationships defined. For example, it is impossible to search for &quot;the phone numbers of all persons who live in Acapulco and each have more than 100 appearances in my photo collection and from whom I have had e-mail within the last month&quot;. Such a search could not be done unless it is based on a data model which has both the semantics as well as relationships of data defined. WinFS aims to provide such a data model and the runtime infrastructure that can be used to store the data, as well as the relationships between data items according to the data model, doing so at a satisfactory level of performance.

==Overview==
WinFS natively recognizes different types of data, such as &quot;picture&quot;, &quot;e-mail&quot;, &quot;document&quot;, &quot;audio&quot;, &quot;video&quot;, &quot;calendar&quot;, &quot;contact&quot;, rather than just leaving them as raw unanalyzed bytestreams (as most file systems do). Data stored and managed by the system are instances of the data type recognized by the WinFS runtime. The data are structured by means of properties. For example, an instance of a &quot;résumé&quot; type will surface the data by exposing properties, such as &quot;Name&quot;, &quot;Educational Qualification&quot;, &quot;Experience&quot;. Each property may be a simple type (&quot;strings&quot;, &quot;integers&quot;, &quot;dates&quot;) or complex types (&quot;contacts&quot;). Different data types expose different properties. Besides that, WinFS also allows different data instances to be related together; such as a document and a contact can be related by an &quot;Authored By&quot; relationship. Relationships are also exposed as properties; for example if a document is related to a contact by a &quot;Created By&quot; relationship, then the document will have a &quot;Created By&quot; property. When it is accessed, the relationship is traversed and the related data returned. By following the relations, all related data can be reached. WinFS promotes sharing of data between applications by making the data types accessible to all applications, along with their schemas. When an application wants to use a WinFS type, it can use the schema to find the data structure and can use the information. So, an application has access to all data on the system even though the developer did not have to write parsers to recognize the different data formats. It can also use relationships and related data to create dynamic filters to present the information the application deals with. The WinFS API further abstracts the task of accessing data. All WinFS types are exposed as .NET objects with the properties of the object directly mapping to the properties of the data type. Also, by letting different applications that deal with the same data share the same WinFS data instance rather than storing the same data in different files, the hassles of synchronizing the different stores when the data change are removed. Thus WinFS can reduce redundancies.

Access to all the data in the system allows complex searches for data across all the data items managed by WinFS. In the example used above (&quot;the phone numbers of all persons who live in Acapulco and each have more than 100 appearances in my photo collection and with whom I have had e-mail within last month&quot;), WinFS can traverse the &quot;subject&quot; relationship of all the photos to find the &quot;contact&quot; items. Similarly, it can filter all emails in last month and access the &quot;communicated with&quot; relation to reach the contacts. The common contacts can then be figured out from the two sets of results and their phone number retrieved by accessing the suitable property of the contact items.

In addition to fully schematized data (like XML and relational data), WinFS supports semi-structured data (such as images, which have an unstructured bitstream plus structured metadata) as well as unstructured data (such as files) as well. It stores the unstructured components as files while storing the structured metadata in the structured store. Internally, WinFS uses a relational database to manage data. It does not limit the data to belonging to any particular data model. The WinFS runtime maps the schema to a relational modality, by defining the tables it will store the types in and the primary keys and foreign keys that would be required to represent the relationships. WinFS includes mappings for object and XML schemas by default. Mappings for other schemas must be specified. Object schemas are specified in XML; WinFS generates code to surface the schemas as .NET classes. ADO.NET can be used to directly specify the relational schema, though a mapping to the object schema must be provided to surface it as classes. Relationship traversals are performed as joins on these tables. WinFS also automatically creates indexes on these tables, to enable fast access to the information. Indexing speeds up joins significantly, and traversing relationships to retrieve related data is performed very fast. Indexes are also used during information search; searching and querying use the indexes to quickly complete the operations, much like desktop search systems.

== Development ==
The development of WinFS is an extension to a feature that was initially planned in the early 1990s. Dubbed &quot;Object File System&quot;, it was supposed to be included as part of Cairo. OFS was supposed to have powerful data aggregation features, but the Cairo project was shelved, and with it OFS. However, later during the development of COM, a storage system, called Storage+, based on then-upcoming SQL Server 8.0, was planned, which was slated to offer similar aggregation features. This, too, never materialized, and a similar technology, &quot;Relational File System&quot; (RFS), was conceived to be launched with SQL Server 2000. However, SQL Server 2000 ended up being a minor upgrade to SQL Server 7.0 and RFS was not implemented.

The concept was not scrapped, and served as the base for WinFS. WinFS was initially planned for inclusion in Windows Vista, and build 4051 of Windows Vista, then called by its codename &quot;Longhorn&quot;, given to developers at the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference in 2003, included WinFS, but it suffered from significant performance issues. In August 2004, Microsoft announced that WinFS would not ship with Windows Vista; it would instead be available as a downloadable update after Vista&#x27;s release.

On August 29, 2005, Microsoft quietly made Beta 1 of WinFS available to MSDN subscribers. It worked on Windows XP, and required the .NET Framework to run. The WinFS API was included in the &quot;System.Storage&quot; namespace. The beta was refreshed on December 1, 2005 to be compatible with version 2.0 of the .NET Framework. WinFS Beta 2 was planned for some time later in 2006, and was supposed to include integration with Windows Desktop Search, so that search results include results from both regular files and WinFS stores, as well as allow access of WinFS data using ADO.NET.

On June 23, 2006, the WinFS team at Microsoft announced that WinFS would no longer be delivered as a separate product, and some components would be brought under the umbrella of other technologies. Many of the principle features Microsoft intended to provide with WinFS included a pane for metadata property editing, breadcrumb-based property navigation, filtering or stacking items over properties, incremental search, and saved searches; these features were incorporated in Windows Vista. &quot;Query composition&quot;, a feature of WinFS that allowed users to perform additional searches that reuse the results of a previous query, was later incorporated in Windows Vista.

Examples of uses of the technology are the object-relational mapping components into ADO.NET Entity Framework; support for unstructured data, adminless mode of operation, support for file system objects via the codice_1 data type, and hierarchical data in SQL Server 2008, then codenamed &quot;Katmai&quot;, as well as integration with Win32 APIs and Windows Shell and support for traversal of hierarchies by traversing relationships into later releases of Microsoft SQL Server; and the synchronization components into Microsoft Sync Framework.

In 2013 Bill Gates cited WinFS as his greatest disappointment at Microsoft and that the idea of WinFS was ahead of its time, which will re-emerge.

==Data storage==

===Architecture===
WinFS uses a relational engine, which derives from SQL Server 2005, to provide the data-relations mechanism. WinFS stores are simply SQL Server database (.MDF) files with the FILESTREAM attribute set. These files are stored in the access-restricted folder named &quot;System Volume Information&quot; (placed in the volume root), in folders under the folder &quot;WinFS&quot; with names of GUIDs of these stores.

At the bottom of the WinFS stack lies &quot;WinFS Core&quot;, which interacts with the filesystem and provides file-access and -addressing capabilities. The relational engine leverages the WinFS core services to present a structured store and other services such as locking, which the WinFS runtime uses to implement the functionality. The WinFS runtime exposes &quot;services&quot; such as &quot;Synchronization&quot; and &quot;Rules&quot; that can be used to synchronize WinFS stores or perform certain actions on the occurrence of certain events.

WinFS runs as a service that runs three processes:

# &quot;WinFS.exe&quot;, which hosts the relational datastore
# &quot;WinFSSearch.exe&quot;, which hosts the indexing and querying engine
# &quot;WinFPM.exe (WinFS File Promotion Manager)&quot;, which interfaces with the underlying file-system

It allows programmatic access to its features via a set of .NET Framework APIs. These enable applications to define custom-made data types, define relationships among data, store and retrieve information, and allow advanced searches. The applications can then aggregate the data and present the aggregated data to the user.

====Data store====
WinFS stores data in relational stores, which are exposed as virtual locations called &quot;stores&quot;. A WinFS store is a common repository where any application can store data along with its metadata, relationships and schema. WinFS runtime can apply certain relationships itself; for example, if the values of the &quot;subject&quot; property of a picture and the &quot;name&quot; property of a contact are identical, then WinFS can relate the contact with the picture. Relations can also be specified by other applications or the user.

WinFS provides unified storage, but stops short of defining the format that is to be stored in the data stores. Instead it supports writing data in application-specific formats. But applications must provide a schema that defines how the file format should be interpreted. For example, a schema could be added to allow WinFS to understand how to read and thus be able to search and analyze, (say) a PDF file. By using the schema, any application can read data from any other application, and this also allows different applications to write in each other&#x27;s format by sharing the schema.

Multiple WinFS stores can be created on a single machine. This allows different classes of data to be kept segregated; for example, official documents and personal documents can be kept in different stores. WinFS, by default, provides only one store, named &quot;DefaultStore&quot;. WinFS stores are exposed as shell objects, akin to Virtual folders, which dynamically generate a list of all items present in the store and present them in a folder view. The shell object also allows searching information in the datastore.

A data unit that has to be stored in a WinFS store is called a WinFS &quot;Item&quot;. A WinFS item, along with the core data item, also contains information on how the data item is related to other data. This &quot;Relationship&quot; is stored in terms of logical links. Links specify which other data items the current item is related with. Put in other words, links specify the relationship of the data with other data items. Links are physically stored using a link identifier, which specifies the name and intent of the relationship, such as &quot;type of&quot; or &quot;consists of&quot;. The link identifier is stored as an attribute of the data item. All the objects that have the same link ID are considered to be related. An XML schema, defining the structure of the data items that will be stored in WinFS, must be supplied to the WinFS runtime beforehand. In Beta 1 of WinFS, the schema assembly had to be added to the GAC before it could be used.

===Data model===
WinFS models data using the data items, along with their relationships, extensions and rules governing its usage. WinFS needs to understand the type and structure of the data items, so that the information stored in the data item can be made available to any application that requests it. This is done by the use of schemas. For every type of data item that is to be stored in WinFS, a corresponding schema needs to be provided to define the type, structure and associations of the data. These schemas are defined using XML.

Predefined WinFS schemas include schemas for documents, e-mail, appointments, tasks, media, audio, video, and also includes system schemas that include configuration, programs, and other system-related data. Custom schemas can be defined on a per-application basis, in situations where an application wants to store its data in WinFS, but not share the structure of that data with other applications, or they can be made available across the system.

====Type system====
The most important difference between a file system and WinFS is that WinFS knows the type of each data item that it stores. And the type specifies the properties of the data item. The WinFS type system is closely associated with the .NET framework&#x27;s concept of classes and inheritance. A new type can be created by extending and nesting any predefined types.

WinFS provides four predefined base types – &quot;Items&quot;, &quot;Relationships&quot;, &quot;ScalarTypes&quot; and &quot;NestedTypes&quot;. An Item is the fundamental data object which can be stored, and a Relationship is the relation or link between two data items. Since all WinFS items must have a type, the type of item stored defines its properties. The properties of an Item may be a ScalarType, which defines the smallest unit of information a property can have, or a NestedType, which is a collection of more than one ScalarTypes and/or NestedTypes. All WinFS types are made available as .NET CLR classes.

Any object represented as a data unit, such as contact, image, video, document etc., can be stored in a WinFS store as a specialization of the Item type. By default, WinFS provides Item types for Files, Contact, Documents, Pictures, Audio, Video, Calendar, and Messages. The File Item can store any generic data, which is stored in file systems as files. But unless an advanced schema is provided for the file, by defining it to be a specialized Item, WinFS will not be able to access its data. Such a file Item can only support being related to other Items.

A developer can extend any of these types, or the base type Item, to provide a type for their custom data. The data contained in an Item is defined in terms of properties, or fields that hold the actual data. For example, an Item &quot;Contact&quot; may have a field &quot;Name&quot; that is a ScalarType, and one field &quot;Address&quot;, a NestedType, which is further composed of two ScalarTypes. To define this type, the base class Item is extended and the necessary fields are added to the class. A NestedType field can be defined as another class that contains the two ScalarType fields. Once the type is defined, a schema has to be defined, which denotes the primitive type of each field, for example, the Name field is a String, the Address field is a custom defined Address class, both the fields of which are Strings. Other primitive types that WinFS supports are Integer, Byte, Decimal, Float, Double, Boolean and DateTime, among others. The schema will also define which fields are mandatory and which are optional. The Contact Item defined in this way will be used to store information regarding the Contact, by populating the properties field and storing it. Only those fields marked as mandatory needs to be filled up during initial save. Other fields may be populated later by the user, or not populated at all. If more properties fields, such as &quot;last conversed date&quot;, need to be added, this type can be extended to accommodate them. Item types for other data can be defined similarly.

WinFS creates tables for all defined Items. All the fields defined for the Item form the columns of the table and all instances of the Item are stored as rows in the table for the respective Items. Whenever some field in the table refers to data in some other table, it is considered a relationship. The schema of the relationship specifies which tables are involved and what the kind and name of the relationship is. The WinFS runtime manages the relationship schemas. All Items are exposed as .NET CLR objects, with a uniform interface providing access to the data stored in the fields. Thus any application can retrieve object of any Item type and can use the data in the object, without being aware of the physical structure the data was stored in.

WinFS types are exposed as .NET classes, which can be instantiated as .NET objects. Data are stored in these type instances by setting their properties. Once done, they are persisted into the WinFS store. A WinFS store is accessed using an &quot;ItemContext&quot; class (see Data retrieval section for details). ItemContext allows transactional access to the WinFS store; i.e. all the operations since binding an ItemContext object to a store till it is closed either all succeed or are all rolled back. As changes are made to the data, they are not written to the disc; rather they are written to an in-memory log. Only when the connection is closed are the changes written to the disc in a batch. This helps to optimize disc I/O. The following code snippet, written in C#, creates a contact and stores it in a WinFS store.
// Connect to the default WinFS store
using (ItemContext ic = ItemContext.Open())
 // Create the contact and set the data in appropriate properties
 ContactEAddress contact = new ContactEAddress() {
 Name = new PersonName() { // Name is a ComplexType
 Displayname = &quot;Doe, John&quot;,
 FirstName = &quot;John&quot;,
 LastName = &quot;Doe&quot;
 TelephoneNumber = new TelephoneNumber() { // Telephone number is a ComplexType
 Country = CountryCode.Antarctica,
 Areacode = 4567,
 Number = 9876543210
 Age = 111 // Age is a SimpleType

 // Add the object to the user&#x27;s personal folder.
 // This relates the item with the folder pseudo-type, for backward
 // compatibility, as this lets the item to be accessed in a folder 
 // hierarchy for apps which are not WinFS native.
 Folder containingFolder = UserDataFolder.FindMyPersonalFolder();
 containingFolder.OutFolderMemberRelationship.AddItem(ic, contact);

 // Find a document and relate with the document. Searching begins by creating an
 // ItemSearcher object. Each WinFS type object contains a GetSearcher() method
 // that generates an ItemSearcher object which searches documents of that type.
 using (ItemSearcher searcher = Document.GetSearcher(ic))
 Document d = searcher.Find(@&quot;Title = &#x27;Some Particular Document&#x27;&quot;);
 d.OutAuthoringRelationship.AddItem(ic, contact);
 // Since only one document is to be found, the ItemContext.FindOne() method
 // could be used as well.

 // Find a picture and relate with it
 using (ItemSearcher searcher = Picture.GetSearcher(ic))
 Picture p = searcher.Find(@&quot;Occasion = &#x27;Graduation&#x27; and Sequence = &#x27;3&#x27;&quot;);
 p.OutSubjectRelationship.AddItem(ic, contact);

 // Persist to the store and close the reference to the store
 ic.Update();


====Relationships====
A datum can be related to one more item, giving rise to a one-to-one relationship, or with more than one items, resulting in a one-to-many relationship. The related items, in turn, may be related to other data items as well, resulting in a network of relationships, which is called a many-to-many relationship. Creating a relationship between two Items creates another field in the data of the Items concerned which refer the row in the other Item&#x27;s table where the related object is stored.

In WinFS, a Relationship is an instance of the base type Relationship, which is extended to signify a specialization of a relation. A Relationship is a mapping between two items, a Source and a Target. The source has an Outgoing Relationship, whereas the target gets an Incoming Relationship. WinFS provides three types of primitive relationships – &quot;Holding Relationship&quot;, &quot;Reference Relationship&quot; and &quot;Embedding Relationship&quot;. Any custom relationship between two data types are instances of these relationship types.

* Holding Relationships specify ownership and lifetime (which defines how long the relationship is valid) of the Target Item. For example, the Relationship between a folder and a file, and between an Employee and his Salary record, is a Holding Relationship – the latter is to be removed when the former is removed. A Target Item can be a part of more than one Holding Relationships. In such a case, it is to be removed when all the Source Items are removed.
* Reference Relationships provide linkage between two Items, but do not have any lifetime associated, i.e., each Item will continue to be stored even without the other.
* Embedding Relationships give order to the two Items that are linked by the Relationship, such as the Relationship between a Parent Item and a Child Item.

Relationships between two Items can either be set programmatically by the application creating the data, or the user can use the WinFS Item Browser to manually relate the Items. A WinFS item browser can also graphically display the items and how they are related, to enable the user to know how their data are organized.

====Rules====
WinFS includes &quot;Rules&quot;, which are executed when a certain condition is met. WinFS rules work on data and data relationships. For example, a rule can be created that states that whenever an Item is created which contains field &quot;Name&quot; and if the value of that field is some particular name, a relationship should be created that relates the Item with some other Item. WinFS rules can also access any external application. For example, a rule can be built which launches a &quot;Notify&quot; application whenever a mail is received from a particular contact. WinFS rules can also be used to add new properties fields to existing data Items.

WinFS rules are also exposed as .NET CLR objects. As such any rule can be used for any purpose. A rule can even be extended by inheriting from it to form a new rule that consists of the condition and action of the parent rule plus something more.

===RAV===
WinFS supports creating &quot;Rich Application Views&quot; (RAV) by aggregating different data in a virtual table format. Unlike database view, where each individual element can only be a scalar value, RAVs can have complex Items or even collections of Items. The actual data can be across multiple data types or instances and can even be retrieved by traversing relationships. RAVs are intrinsically paged (dividing the entire set of data into smaller &quot;pages&quot; containing disconnected subsets of the data) by the WinFS runtime. The page size is defined during creation of the view and the WinFS API exposes methods to iterate over the pages. RAVs also supports modification of the view according to different grouping parameters. Views can also be queried against.

===Access control===
Even though all data are shared, everything is not equally accessible. WinFS uses the Windows authentication system to provide two data protection mechanisms. First, there is share-level security that controls access to your WinFS share. Second, there is item level security that supports NT compatible security descriptors. The process accessing the item must have enough privileges to access it. Also in Vista there is the concept of &quot;integrity level&quot; for an application. Higher integrity data cannot be accessed by a lower integrity process.

==Data retrieval==

The primary mode of data retrieval from a WinFS store is querying the WinFS store according to some criteria, which returns an enumerable set of items matching the criteria. The criteria for the query is specified using the OPath query language. The returned data are made available as instances of the type schemas, conforming to the .NET object model. The data in them can be accessed by accessing the properties of individual objects.

Relations are also exposed as properties. Each WinFS Item has two properties, named &quot;IncomingRelationships&quot; and &quot;OutgoingRelationships&quot;, which provide access to the set of relationship instances the item participates in. The other item which participates in one relationship instance can be reached through the proper relationship instance.

The fact that the data can be accessed using its description, rather than location, can be used to provide end-user organizational capabilities without limiting to the hierarchical organization as used in file-systems. In a file system, each file or folder is contained in only one folder. But WinFS Items can participate in any number of holding relationships, that too with any other items. As such, end users are not limited to only file/folder organization. Rather, a contact can become a container for documents; a picture a container for contacts and so on. For legacy compatibility, WinFS includes a pseudo-type called &quot;Folder,&quot; which is present only to participate in holding relationships and emulate file/folder organization. Since any WinFS Item can be related with more than one Folder item, from an end user perspective, an item can reside in multiple folders without duplicating the actual data. Applications can also analyze the relationship graphs to present various filters. For example, an email application can analyze the related contacts and the relationships of the contacts with restaurant bills and dynamically generate filters like &quot;Emails sent to people I had lunch with&quot;.

===Searches===
The WinFS API provides a class called the &quot;ItemContext&quot; class, which is bound to a WinFS store. The &quot;ItemContext&quot; object can be used to scope the search to the entire store or a subset of it. It also provides transactional access to the store. An object of this class can then spawn an &quot;ItemSearcher&quot; object which then takes the type (an object representing the type) of the item to be retrieved or the relationship and the OPath query string representing the criteria for the search. A set of all matches is returned, which can then be bound to a UI widget for displaying &quot;en masse&quot; or enumerating individually. The properties items can also be modified and then stored back to the data store to update the data. The ItemContext object is &quot;closed&quot; (which marks the end of association of the object with the store) when the queries are made or changes merged into the store.

Related items can also be accessed through the items. The &quot;IncomingRelationships&quot; and &quot;OutgoingRelationships&quot; properties give access to all the set of relationship instances, typed to the name of the relationship. These relationship objects expose the other item via a property. So, for example, if a picture is related to a picture, it can be accessed by &quot;traversing&quot; the relationship as:
ContactsCollection contacts = picture.OutgoingRelationships.Cast(typeof(Contact)).Value;
// This retrieves the collection of all outgoing relationships from a picture object
// and filters down the contacts reachable from them and retrieves its value.

// Or the relationship can be statically specified as
ContactsCollection contacts = picture.OutgoingRelationships.OutContactRelationship.Contact;

An OPath query string allows to express the parameters that will be queried for to be specified using &quot;Item&quot; properties, embedded &quot;Items&quot; as well as &quot;Relationships&quot;. It can specify a single search condition, such as &quot;title = Something&#x27;&quot;, or a compound condition such as &quot;title = &#x27;Title 1&#x27; || title = &#x27;Title 2&#x27; &amp;&amp; author = &#x27;Someone&#x27;&quot;. These Boolean and relational operations can be specified using C# like &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;, &quot;||&quot;, &quot;=&quot;, &quot;!=&quot; operators as well as their English-like equivalent like &quot;EQUAL&quot;, &quot;NOT EQUAL&quot;. SQL like operators such as &quot;LIKE&quot;, &quot;GROUP BY&quot; and &quot;ORDER BY&quot; are also supported, as are wildcard conditions. So, &quot;title LIKE &#x27;any*&#x27;&quot; is a valid query string. These operators can be used to execute complex searches such as 

using (ItemContext ic = ItemContext.Open())
 // Searching begins by creating a ItemSearcher object. The searcher is created from a
 // relationship instance because the contacts being searched for are in relation. The
 // first parameter defines the scope of the search. An ItemContext as the scope means
 // the entire store is to be searched. Scope can be limited to a set of Items which may
 // be in a holding relationship with the contacts. In that case, the set is passed as
 // the scope of the search.
 ItemSearcher searcher = OutContactRelationship.GetTargetSearcher(ic, typeof(Contact));
 ContactCollection contacts = searcher.FindAll(&quot;OutContactRelationship.Contact.Name LIKE &#x27;A*&#x27;&quot;);

The above code snippet creates an ItemSearcher object that searches on the &quot;OutContactRelationship&quot; instance that relates pictures and contacts, in effect searching all pictures related with a contact. It then runs the query &quot;Name LIKE &#x27;A*&#x27;&quot;&quot; on all contacts reachable through &quot;OutContactRelationship&quot;, returning the list of &quot;contacts whose names start with A and whose pictures I have&quot;. Similarly, more relationships could be taken into account to further narrow down the results. Further, a natural language query processor, which parses query in natural language and creates a well-formed OPath query string to search via proper relationships, can allow users to make searches such as &quot;find the name of the wine I had with person X last month&quot;, provided financial management applications are using WinFS to store bills.

Different relations specify a different set of data. So when a search is made that encompasses multiple relations, the different sets of data are retrieved individually and a union of the different sets is computed. The resulting set contains only those data items that correspond to all the relations.

===Notifications===
WinFS includes better support for handling data that changes frequently. Using WinFS &quot;Notifications&quot;, applications choose to be notified of changes to selected data &quot;Items&quot;. WinFS will raise an &quot;ItemChangedEvent&quot;, using the .NET Event model, when a subscribed-to Item changes, and the event will be published to the applications.
===Information Agent===
WinFS includes an Information Agent feature for the management, retrieval, and storage of end-user notification rules and preferences for changes to items in the data store. Using Information Agent, it is possible to automatically define relations to new items based on events such as appointments, with an example being that appointments can be related to photos based on the dates the photos were taken, enabling queries for birthdays or holidays without needing to know the actual dates of such events (&quot;&quot;find all photos taken on this birthday&quot;). Other examples include automatically moving new items to specific folders based on a rule as determined by appointment times and dates the photos were taken (&quot;when I import a photo taken during a business event, move it to the Business Events folder&quot;) or more complex possibilities. Information Agent can also forward notifications to other devices (&quot;if I receive a high priority email from my boss, send a notification to my phone&quot;&quot;) and is similar to Rules and Alerts functionality of Microsoft Outlook.

==Data sharing==
WinFS allows easy sharing of data between applications, and among multiple WinFS stores, which may reside on different computers, by copying to and from them. A WinFS item can also be copied to a non-WinFS file system, but unless that data item is put back into the WinFS store, it will not support the advanced services provided by WinFS.

The WinFS API also provides some support for sharing with non-WinFS applications. WinFS exposes a shell object to access WinFS stores. This object maps WinFS items to a virtual folder hierarchy, and can be accessed by any application. Virtual folders can automatically share new content referenced by the query with users (a virtual folder for &quot;all vacation photos&quot; can automatically share new items returned by this query with users). WinFS data can also be manually shared using network shares, by sharing the legacy shell object. Non-WinFS file formats can be stored in WinFS stores, using the File Item, provided by WinFS. Importers can be written, to convert specific file formats to WinFS Item types.

In addition, WinFS provides services to automatically synchronize items in two or more WinFS stores, subject to some predefined condition, such as &quot;&quot;share only photos&quot; or &quot;share photos that have an associated contact X&quot;&quot;. The stores may be on different computers. Synchronization is done in a peer-to-peer fashion; there is no central authority. A synchronization can be either manual or automatic or scheduled. During synchronization, WinFS finds the new and modified Items, and updates accordingly. If two or more changes conflict, WinFS can either resort to automatic resolution based on predefined rules, or defer the synchronization for manual resolution. WinFS also updates the schemas, if required.

==Application support==

===Shell namespace===
WinFS Beta 1 includes a shell namespace extension, which surfaces WinFS stores as top level objects in &quot;My Computer&quot; view. Files can be copied into and out of the stores, as well as applications can be directly used to save there. Even folders such as &quot;My Documents&quot; can be redirected to the stores. WinFS uses &quot;Importer&quot; plug-ins to analyze the files as they were being imported to the store and create proper WinFS schemas and objects, and when taking the objects out, re-pack them into files. If importers for certain files are not installed, they are stored as generic &quot;File&quot; types.

===Microsoft Rave===
&quot;Microsoft Rave&quot; is an application that shipped with WinFS Beta 1. It allows synchronization of two or more WinFS stores, and supports synchronization in &quot;full mesh&quot; mode as well as the &quot;central hub&quot; topology. While synchronizing, Microsoft Rave will determine the changes made to each store since the last sync, and update accordingly. When applying the changes, it also detects if there is any conflict, i.e., the same data has been changed on both stores since the last synchronization. It will either log the conflicting data for later resolution or have it resolved immediately. Microsoft Rave uses peer-to-peer technology to communicate and transfer data.

===StoreSpy===

With WinFS Beta 1, Microsoft included an unsupported application called &quot;StoreSpy&quot;, which allowed one to browse WinFS stores by presenting a hierarchical view of WinFS Items. It automatically generated virtual folders based on access permissions, date and other metadata, and presented them in a hierarchical tree view, akin to what traditional folders are presented in. The application generated tabs for different Item types. StoreSpy allowed viewing &quot;Items&quot;, &quot;Relationships&quot;, &quot;MultiSet&quot;, &quot;Nested Elements&quot;, &quot;Extensions&quot; and other types in the store along with its full metadata. It also presented a search interface to perform manual searches, and save them as virtual folders. The application also presented a graphical view of WinFS Rules. However, it did not allow editing of Items or their properties, though it was slated for inclusion in a future release. But the WinFS project was cut back before it could materialize.

===Type Browser===
WinFS also includes another application, named &quot;WinFS Type Browser&quot;, which can be used to browse the WinFS types, as well as visualize the hierarchical relationship between WinFS types. A WinFS type, both built-in types as well as custom schemas, can be visualized along with all the properties and methods that it supports. It also shows the types that it derives from as well as other types that extend the type schema. However, while it was included with WinFS, it was released as an unsupported tool.

===OPather===
WinFS Beta 1 also includes an unsupported application, named &quot;OPather&quot;. It presents a graphical interface for writing Opath queries. It can be used by selecting target object type and specifying the parameters of the query. It also includes Intellisense-like parameter completion feature. It can then be used to perform visualization tasks like binding results of a query to a &quot;DataGrid&quot; control, create views of the data in WinFS itself, or just extract the query string.

===Project &quot;Orange&quot;===
Microsoft launched a project to build a data visualization application for WinFS. It was codenamed &quot;Project Orange&quot; and was supposedly built using Windows Presentation Foundation. It was supposed to provide exploration of &quot;Items&quot; stored in WinFS stores, and data relationships were supposed to be a prominent part of the navigation model. It was supposed to let people allow organization of the WinFS stores graphically as well – productizing many of the concepts shown in the IWish Concept Video WMV File. However, since the WinFS project went dark, the status of this project is unknown.

<text>Project Blue Book was the code name for the systematic study of unidentified flying objects by the United States Air Force from March 1952 to its termination on December 17, 1969. The project, headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, was initially directed by Captain Edward J. Ruppelt and followed projects of a similar nature such as Project Sign established in 1947, and Project Grudge in 1949. Project Blue Book had two goals, namely, to determine if UFOs were a threat to national security, and to scientifically analyze UFO-related data.

Thousands of UFO reports were collected, analyzed, and filed. As a result of the &quot;Condon Report&quot;, which concluded that the study of UFOs was unlikely to yield major scientific discoveries, and a review of the report by the National Academy of Sciences, Project Blue Book was terminated in 1969. The Air Force supplies the following summary of its investigations:

By the time Project Blue Book ended, it had collected 12,618 UFO reports, and concluded that most of them were misidentifications of natural phenomena (clouds, stars, etc.) or conventional aircraft. According to the National Reconnaissance Office a number of the reports could be explained by flights of the formerly secret reconnaissance planes U-2 and A-12. 701 reports were classified as unexplained, even after stringent analysis. The UFO reports were archived and are available under the Freedom of Information Act, but names and other personal information of all witnesses have been redacted.

==Previous projects==

Public USAF UFO studies were first initiated under Project Sign at the end of 1947, following many widely publicized UFO reports (see Kenneth Arnold). Project Sign was initiated specifically at the request of General Nathan Twining, chief of the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Wright-Patterson was also to be the home of Project Sign and all subsequent official USAF public investigations.

Project Sign was officially inconclusive regarding the cause of the sightings. However, according to US Air Force Captain Edward J. Ruppelt (the first director of Project Blue Book), Sign&#x27;s initial intelligence estimate (the so-called Estimate of the Situation) written in the late summer of 1948, concluded that the flying saucers were real craft, were not made by either the Soviet Union or United States, and were likely extraterrestrial in origin. (See also extraterrestrial hypothesis.) This was subsequently rejected by Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg, USAF Chief of Staff, citing a lack of physical proof. Vandenberg subsequently dismantled Project Sign.

Project Sign was succeeded at the end of 1948 by Project Grudge, which was criticized as having a debunking mandate. Ruppelt referred to the era of Project Grudge as the &quot;dark ages&quot; of early USAF UFO investigation. Grudge concluded that all UFOs were natural phenomena or other misinterpretations, although it also stated that 23 percent of the reports could not be explained.

==Project Blue Book history==
===Captain Ruppelt era===

According to Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, by the end of 1951, several high-ranking, very influential USAF generals were so dissatisfied with the state of Air Force UFO investigations that they dismantled Project Grudge and replaced it with Project Blue Book in March 1952. One of these men was Gen. Charles P. Cabell. Another important change came when General William Garland joined Cabell&#x27;s staff; Garland thought the UFO question deserved serious scrutiny because he had witnessed a UFO.

The new name, Project Blue Book, was selected to refer to the blue booklets used for testing at some colleges and universities. The name was inspired, said Ruppelt, by the close attention that high-ranking officers were giving the new project; it felt as if the study of UFOs was as important as a college final exam. Blue Book was also upgraded in status from Project Grudge, with the creation of the Aerial Phenomenon Branch.

Ruppelt was the first head of the project. He was an experienced airman, having been decorated for his efforts with the Army Air Corps during World War II, and having afterward earned an aeronautics degree. He officially coined the term &quot;Unidentified Flying Object&quot;, to replace the many terms (&quot;flying saucer&quot;, &quot;flying disk&quot; and so on) the military had previously used; Ruppelt thought that &quot;unidentified flying object&quot; was a more neutral and accurate term. Ruppelt resigned from the Air Force some years later and wrote the book &quot;The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects&quot;, which described the study of UFOs by the United States Air Force from 1947 to 1955. American scientist Michael D. Swords wrote that &quot;Ruppelt would lead the last genuine effort to analyze UFOs&quot;.

Ruppelt implemented a number of changes: He streamlined the manner in which UFOs were reported to (and by) military officials, partly in hopes of alleviating the stigma and ridicule associated with UFO witnesses. Ruppelt also ordered the development of a standard questionnaire for UFO witnesses, hoping to uncover data that could be subject to statistical analysis. He commissioned the Battelle Memorial Institute to create the questionnaire and computerize the data. Using case reports and the computerized data, Battelle then conducted a massive scientific and statistical study of all Air Force UFO cases, completed in 1954 and known as &quot;Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14&quot; (see summary below).

Knowing that factionalism had harmed the progress of Project Sign, Ruppelt did his best to avoid the kinds of open-ended speculation that had led to Sign&#x27;s personnel being split among advocates and critics of the extraterrestrial hypothesis. As Michael Hall writes, &quot;Ruppelt not only took the job seriously but expected his staff to do so as well. If anyone under him either became too skeptical or too convinced of one particular theory, they soon found themselves off the project&quot;. In his book, Ruppelt reported that he fired three personnel very early in the project because they were either &quot;too pro&quot; or &quot;too con&quot; one hypothesis or another. Ruppelt sought the advice of many scientists and experts, and issued regular press releases (along with classified monthly reports for military intelligence).

Each U.S. Air Force Base had a Blue Book officer to collect UFO reports and forward them to Ruppelt. During most of Ruppelt&#x27;s tenure, he and his team were authorized to interview any and all military personnel who witnessed UFOs and were not required to follow the chain of command. This unprecedented authority underlined the seriousness of Blue Book&#x27;s investigation.

Under Ruppelt&#x27;s direction, Blue Book investigated a number of well-known UFO cases, including the so-called Lubbock Lights, and a widely publicized 1952 radar/visual case over Washington D.C. According to Jacques Vallée, Ruppelt started the trend, largely followed by later Blue Book investigations, of not giving serious consideration to numerous reports of UFO landings and/or interaction with purported UFO occupants.

Astronomer J. Allen Hynek was the scientific consultant of the project. He had been with Projects Sign and Grudge. He worked for the project up to its termination and initially created the categorization which has been extended and is known today as Close encounters. He was a pronounced skeptic when he started, but said that his feelings changed to a more wavering skepticism during the research, after encountering a minority of UFO reports he thought were unexplainable. 

Ruppelt left Blue Book in February 1953 for a temporary reassignment. He returned a few months later to find his staff reduced from more than ten, to two subordinates. Frustrated, Ruppelt suggested that an Air Defense Command unit (the 4602nd Air Intelligence Service Squadron) be charged with UFO investigations.

====Robertson Panel====
In July 1952, after a build-up of hundreds of sightings over the previous few months, a series of radar detections coincident with visual sightings were observed near the National Airport in Washington, D.C. (see 1952 Washington D.C. UFO incident).

After much publicity, these sightings led the Central Intelligence Agency to establish a panel of scientists headed by H. P. Robertson, a physicist of the California Institute of Technology, which included various physicists, meteorologists, and engineers, and one astronomer (Hynek). The Robertson Panel first met on January 14, 1953 in order to formulate a response to the overwhelming public interest in UFOs.

Ruppelt, Hynek, and others presented the best evidence, including movie footage, that had been collected by Blue Book. After spending 12 hours reviewing 6 years of data, the Robertson Panel concluded that most UFO reports had prosaic explanations and that all could be explained with further investigation, which they deemed not worth the effort.

In their final report, they stressed that low-grade, unverifiable UFO reports were overloading intelligence channels, with the risk of missing a genuine conventional threat to the U.S. Therefore, they recommended the Air Force de-emphasize the subject of UFOs and embark on a debunking campaign to lessen public interest. They suggested debunkery through the mass media, including Walt Disney Productions, and using psychologists, astronomers, and celebrities to ridicule the phenomenon and put forward prosaic explanations. Furthermore, civilian UFO groups &quot;should be watched because of their potentially great influence on mass thinking ... The apparent irresponsibility and the possible use of such groups for subversive purposes should be kept in mind.&quot;

It is the conclusion of many researchers that the Robertson Panel was recommending controlling public opinion through a program of official propaganda and spying. They also believe these recommendations helped shape Air Force policy regarding UFO study not only immediately afterward, but also into the present day. There is evidence that the Panel&#x27;s recommendations were being carried out at least two decades after its conclusions were issued (see the main article for details and citations).

In December 1953, Joint Army-Navy-Air Force Regulation number 146 made it a crime for military personnel to discuss classified UFO reports with unauthorized persons. Violators faced up to two years in prison and/or fines of up to $10,000.

====Aftermath of Robertson Panel====
In his book (see external links) Ruppelt described the demoralization of the Blue Book staff and the stripping of their investigative duties following the Robertson Panel jurisdiction.

As an immediate consequence of the Robertson Panel recommendations, in February 1953, the Air Force issued Regulation 200-2, ordering air base officers to publicly discuss UFO incidents only if they were judged to have been solved, and to classify all the unsolved cases to keep them out of the public eye.

The same month, investigative duties started to be taken on by the newly formed 4602nd Air Intelligence Squadron (AISS) of the Air Defense Command. The 4602nd AISS was assigned the task of investigating only the most important UFO cases with intelligence or national security implications. These cases were deliberately siphoned away from Blue Book, leaving Blue Book to deal with the more trivial reports.

General Nathan Twining, who started Project Sign in 1947, was now Air Force Chief of Staff. In August 1954, he was to further codify the responsibilities of the 4602nd AISS by issuing an updated Air Force Regulation 200-2. In addition, UFOs (called &quot;UFOBs&quot;) were defined as &quot;any airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or which cannot be positively identified as a familiar object.&quot; Investigation of UFOs was stated to be for the purposes of national security and to ascertain &quot;technical aspects.&quot; AFR 200-2 again stated that Blue Book could discuss UFO cases with the media only if they were regarded as having a conventional explanation. If they were unidentified, the media was to be told only that the situation was being analyzed. Blue Book was also ordered to reduce the number of unidentified to a minimum.

All this work was done secretly. The public face of Blue Book continued to be the official Air Force investigation of UFOs, but the reality was it had essentially been reduced to doing very few serious investigations and had become almost solely a public relations outfit with a debunking mandate. To cite one example, by the end of 1956, the number of cases listed as unsolved had dipped to barely 0.4 percent, from 20 to 30% only a few years earlier.

Eventually, Ruppelt requested reassignment; at his departure in August 1953, his staff had been reduced from more than ten (precise numbers of personnel varied) to just two subordinates and himself. His temporary replacement was a noncommissioned officer. Most who succeeded him as Blue Book director exhibited either apathy or outright hostility to the subject of UFOs or were hampered by a lack of funding and official support.

UFO investigators often regard Ruppelt&#x27;s brief tenure at Blue Book as the high-water mark of public Air Force investigations of UFOs, when UFO investigations were treated seriously and had support at high levels. Thereafter, Project Blue Book descended into a new &quot;Dark Ages&quot; from which many UFO investigators argue it never emerged. However, Ruppelt later came to embrace the Blue Book perspective that there was nothing extraordinary about UFOs; he even labeled the subject a &quot;Space Age Myth&quot;.

===Captain Hardin era===
In March 1954, Captain Charles Hardin was appointed the head of Blue Book; however, the 4602nd conducted most UFO investigations, and Hardin did not object. Ruppelt wrote that Hardin &quot;thinks that anyone who is even interested [in UFOs] is crazy. They bore him.&quot;

In 1955, the Air Force decided that the goal of Blue Book should not be to investigate UFO reports but to minimize the number of unidentified UFO reports. By late 1956, the number of unidentified sightings had dropped from the 20–25% of the Ruppelt era to less than 1%.

===Captain Gregory era===
Captain George T. Gregory took over as Blue Book&#x27;s director in 1956. Clark writes that Gregory led Blue Book &quot;in an even firmer anti-UFO direction than the apathetic Hardin.&quot; The 4602nd was dissolved, and the 1066th Air Intelligence Service Squadron was charged with UFO investigations.

In fact, there was actually little or no investigation of UFO reports; a revised AFR 200-2 issued during Gregory&#x27;s tenure emphasized that unexplained UFO reports must be reduced to a minimum.

One way that Gregory reduced the number of unexplained UFOs was by simple reclassification. &quot;Possible cases&quot; became &quot;probable&quot;, and &quot;probable&quot; cases were upgraded to certainties. By this logic, a &quot;possible&quot; comet became a &quot;probable&quot; comet, while a probable comet was flatly declared to have been a misidentified comet. Similarly, if a witness reported an observation of an unusual balloon - &quot;like&quot; object, Blue Book usually classified it as a balloon, with no research and qualification. These procedures became standard for most of Blue Book&#x27;s later investigations; see Hynek&#x27;s comments below.

===Major Friend era===
Lt. Col. Robert J. Friend was appointed the head of Blue Book in 1958. Friend made some attempts to reverse the direction Blue Book had taken since 1954. Clark writes that &quot;Friend&#x27;s efforts to upgrade the files and catalog sightings according to various observed statistics were frustrated by a lack of funding and assistance.&quot;

Heartened by Friend&#x27;s efforts, Hynek organized the first of several meetings between Blue Book staffers and ATIC personnel in 1959. Hynek suggested that some older UFO reports should be reevaluated, with the ostensible aim of moving them from the &quot;unknown&quot; to the &quot;identified&quot; category. Hynek&#x27;s plans came to naught.

During Friend&#x27;s tenure, ATIC contemplated passing the oversight of Blue Book to another Air Force agency, but neither the Air Research and Development Center nor the Office of Information for the Secretary of the Air Force was interested.

In 1960, there were U.S. Congressional hearings regarding UFOs. Civilian UFO research group NICAP had publicly charged Blue Book with covering up UFO evidence and had also acquired a few allies in the U.S. Congress. Blue Book was investigated by the Congress and the CIA, with critics - most notably, the civilian UFO group NICAP asserting that Blue Book was lacking as a scientific study. In response, ATIC added personnel (increasing the total personnel to three military personnel, plus civilian secretaries) and increased Blue Book&#x27;s budget. This seemed to mollify some of Blue Book&#x27;s critics, but it was only temporary. A few years later (see below), the criticism would be even louder.

By the time he was transferred from Blue Book in 1963, Friend thought that Blue Book was effectively useless and ought to be dissolved, even if it caused an outcry amongst the public.

===Major Quintanilla era===
Major Hector Quintanilla took over as Blue Book&#x27;s leader in August 1963. He largely continued the debunking efforts, and it was under his direction that Blue Book received some of its sharpest criticism. UFO researcher Jerome Clark goes so far as to write that, by this time, Blue Book had &quot;lost all credibility.&quot;

Physicist and UFO researcher James E. McDonald once flatly declared that Quintanilla was &quot;not competent&quot; from either a scientific or an investigative perspective, although he also stressed that Quintanilla &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be held accountable for it,&quot; as he was chosen for his position by a superior officer, and was following orders in directing Blue Book.

Blue Book&#x27;s explanations of UFO reports were not universally accepted, however, and critics—including some scientists—suggested that Project Blue Book performed questionable research or, worse, was perpetrating cover up. This criticism grew especially strong and widespread in the 1960s.

Take, for example, the many mostly nighttime UFO reports from the midwestern and southeastern United States in the summer of 1965: Witnesses in Texas reported &quot;multicolored lights&quot; and large aerial objects shaped like eggs or diamonds. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported that Tinker Air Force Base (near Oklahoma City) had tracked up to four UFOs simultaneously, and that several of them had descended very rapidly: from about 22000 feet to about 4000 feet in just a few seconds, an action well beyond the capabilities of conventional aircraft of the era. John Shockley, a meteorologist from Wichita, Kansas, reported that, using the state Weather Bureau radar, he tracked a number of odd aerial objects flying at altitudes between about 6000 and 9000 feet. These and other reports received wide publicity.

Project Blue Book officially determined the witnesses had mistaken Jupiter or bright stars (such as Rigel or Betelgeuse) for something else.

Blue Book&#x27;s explanation was widely criticized as inaccurate. Robert Riser, director of the Oklahoma Science and Art Foundation Planetarium offered a strongly worded rebuke of Project Blue Book that was widely circulated: &quot;That is as far from the truth as you can get. These stars and planets are on the opposite side of the earth from Oklahoma City at this time of year. The Air Force must have had its star finder upside-down during August&quot;.

A newspaper editorial from the &quot;Richmond News Leader&quot; opined that &quot;Attempts to dismiss the reported sightings under the rationale as exhibited by Project Bluebook won&#x27;t solve the mystery ... and serve only to heighten the suspicion that there&#x27;s something out there that the air force doesn&#x27;t want us to know about&quot;, while a Wichita-based UPI reporter noted that &quot;Ordinary radar does not pick up planets and stars&quot;.

Another case that Blue Book&#x27;s critics seized upon was the so-called Portage County UFO Chase, which began at about 5.00 am, near Ravenna, Ohio on April 17, 1966. Police officers Dale Spaur and Wilbur Neff spotted what they described as a disc-shaped, silvery object with a bright light emanating from its underside, at about 1000 feet in altitude. They began following the object (which they reported sometimes descended as low as 50 feet), and police from several other jurisdictions were involved in the pursuit. The chase ended about 30 minutes later near Freedom, Pennsylvania, some 85 miles away.

The UFO chase made national news, and the police submitted detailed reports to Blue Book. Five days later, following brief interviews with only one of the police officers (but none of the other ground witnesses), Blue Book&#x27;s director, Major Hector Quintanilla, announced their conclusions: The police (one of them an Air Force gunner during the Korean War) had first chased a communications satellite, then the planet Venus.

This conclusion was widely derided, and police officers strenuously rejected it. In his dissenting conclusion, Hynek described Blue Book&#x27;s conclusions as absurd: in their reports, several of the police had unknowingly described the Moon, Venus &quot;and&quot; the UFO, though they unknowingly described Venus as a bright &quot;star&quot; very near the Moon. Ohio Congressman William Stanton said that &quot;The Air Force has suffered a great loss of prestige in this community ... Once people entrusted with the public welfare no longer think the people can handle the truth, then the people, in return, will no longer trust the government&quot;.

In September 1968, Hynek received a letter from Colonel Raymond Sleeper of the Foreign Technology Division. Sleeper noted that Hynek had publicly accused Blue Book of shoddy science, and further asked Hynek to offer advice on how Blue Book could improve its scientific methods. Hynek was to later declare that Sleeper&#x27;s letter was &quot;the first time in my 20 year association with the air force as scientific consultant that I had been officially asked for criticism and advice [regarding] ... the UFO problem&quot;.

Hynek wrote a detailed response, dated October 7, 1968, suggesting several areas where Blue Book could improve. In part, he wrote:

Despite Sleeper&#x27;s request for criticism, none of Hynek&#x27;s commentary resulted in any substantial changes in Blue Book.

Quintanilla&#x27;s own perspective on the project is documented in his manuscript, &quot;UFOs, An Air Force Dilemma.&quot; Lt. Col Quintanilla wrote the manuscript in 1975, but it was not published until after his death in 1998. Quintanilla states in the text that he personally believed it arrogant to think human beings were the only intelligent life in the universe. Yet, while he found it highly likely that intelligent life existed beyond earth, he had no hard evidence of any extraterrestrial visitation.

===Congressional hearing===

In 1966, a string of UFO sightings in Massachusetts and New Hampshire provoked a Congressional Hearing by the House Committee on Armed Services. According to attachments to the hearing, the Air Force had at first stated that the sightings were the result of a training exercise happening in the area. But NICAP, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, reported that there was no record of a plane flying at the time the sightings occurred. Another report alleged that the UFO was actually a flying billboard advertising gasoline. Raymond Fowler (of NICAP) added his own interviews with the locals, who saw Air Force officers confiscating newspapers with the story of UFOs and telling them not to report what they had seen. Two police officers who had witnessed the UFOs, Eugene Bertrand and David Hunt, wrote a letter to Major Quintanilla stating that they felt their reputations were destroyed by the Air Force. &quot;It was impossible to mistake what we saw for any kind of military operation, regardless of altitude,&quot; the irritated officers wrote, adding that there was no way it could have been a balloon or helicopter.
According to Secretary Harold Brown of the Air Force, Blue Book consisted of three steps: investigation, analysis, and the distribution of information gathered to interested parties. After Brown gave permission, the press were invited into the hearing.
By the time of the hearing, Blue Book had identified and explained 95% of the reported UFO sightings. None of these were extraterrestrial or a threat to national security. Brown himself proclaimed, &quot;I know of no one of scientific standing or executive standing with a detailed knowledge of this, in our organization who believes that they came from extraterrestrial sources.&quot; J. Allen Hynek, a science consultant to Blue Book, suggested in an unedited statement that a &quot;civilian panel of physical and social scientists&quot; be formed &quot;for the express purpose of determining whether a major problem really exist&quot; in regards to UFOs. Hynek remarked that he has &quot;not seen any evidence to confirm&quot; extraterrestrials, &quot;nor do I know any competent scientist who has, or who believes that any kind of extraterrestrial intelligence is involved.&quot;

===Condon Committee===
Criticism of Blue Book continued to grow through the mid-1960s. NICAP&#x27;s membership ballooned to about 15,000, and the group charged the U.S. Government with a cover-up of UFO evidence.

Following U.S. Congressional hearings, the Condon Committee was established in 1966, ostensibly as a neutral scientific research body. However, the Committee became mired in controversy, with some members charging director Edward U. Condon with bias, and critics would question the validity and the scientific rigor of the Condon Report.

In the end, the Condon Committee suggested that there was nothing extraordinary about UFOs, and while it left a minority of cases unexplained, the report also argued that further research would not be likely to yield significant results.

===End===
In response to the Condon Committee&#x27;s conclusions, Secretary of the Air Force Robert C. Seamans, Jr. announced that Blue Book would soon be closed because further funding &quot;cannot be justified either on the grounds of national security or in the interest of science.&quot; The last publicly acknowledged day of Blue Book operations was December 17, 1969. However, researcher Brad Sparks, citing research from the May 1970 issue of NICAP&#x27;s &quot;UFO Investigator&quot;, reports that the last day of Blue Book activity was actually January 30, 1970. According to Sparks, Air Force officials wanted to keep the Air Force&#x27;s reaction to the UFO problem from overlapping into a fourth decade, and thus altered the date of Blue Book&#x27;s closure in official files.

Blue Book&#x27;s files were sent to the Air Force Archives at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. Major David Shea was to later claim that Maxwell was chosen because it was &quot;accessible yet not too inviting.&quot;

Ultimately, Project Blue Book stated that UFOs sightings were generated as a result of:
* A mild form of mass hysteria.
* Individuals who fabricate such reports to perpetrate a hoax or seek publicity.
* Psychopathological persons.
* Misidentification of various conventional objects.

In April 2003, the USAF publicly indicated that there were no immediate plans to re-establish any official government UFO study programs. However, in December 2017 it was disclosed that a new secret UFO study titled the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) was funded at 22 million dollars from 2007 to 2012.

==USAF official statement on UFOs==
Below is the United States Air Force&#x27;s official statement regarding UFOs, as noted in USAF Fact Sheet 95-03:

===Post-Blue Book U.S.A.F. UFO activities===
An Air Force memorandum (released via the Freedom of Information Act) dated October 20, 1969, and signed by Brigadier General Carroll H. &quot;Rip&quot; Bolender (the Deputy Director of Development and Acquisitions under the Air Force&#x27;s Deputy Chief of Staff, Research and Development) states that even after Blue Book was dissolved, that &quot;reports of UFOs&quot; would still &quot;continue to be handled through the standard Air Force procedure designed for this purpose.&quot; Furthermore, wrote Bolender, &quot;Reports of unidentified flying objects which could affect national security ... are not part of the Blue Book system.&quot; To date, these other investigation channels, agencies or groups (and Bolender&#x27;s involvement therein) are unknown. Upon drafting the memo, Bolender, who assumed his generalship in 1965, had recently completed a detached tour as Program Manager for Lunar Excursion Module Operations in the Apollo program, likely reporting to fellow detached Air Force officer Samuel C. Phillips. He would continue to serve in this position and rank until he retired from the Air Force in 1972.

Additionally, author Howard Blum reports that Freedom of Information Act requests show that the U.S. Air Force has continued to catalog and track UFO sightings, particularly a series of dozens of UFO encounters from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s that occurred at U.S. military facilities with nuclear weapons. Blum writes that some of these official documents depart drastically from the normally dry and bureaucratic wording of government paperwork, making obvious the sense of &quot;terror&quot; that these UFO incidents inspired in many U.S.A.F. personnel.

==Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14==

In late December 1951, Ruppelt met with members of the Battelle Memorial Institute, a think tank based in Columbus, Ohio. Ruppelt wanted their experts to assist them in making the Air Force UFO study more scientific. It was the Battelle Institute that devised the standardized reporting form. Starting in late March 1952, the Institute started analyzing existing sighting reports and encoding about 30 report characteristics onto IBM punched cards for computer analysis.

Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 was their massive statistical analysis of Blue Book cases to date, some 3200 by the time the report was completed in 1954, after Ruppelt had left Blue Book. Even today, it represents the largest such study ever undertaken. Battelle employed four scientific analysts, who sought to divide cases into &quot;knowns&quot;, &quot;unknowns&quot;, and a third category of &quot;insufficient information.&quot; They also broke down knowns and unknowns into four categories of quality, from excellent to poor. E.g., cases deemed excellent might typically involve experienced witnesses such as airline pilots or trained military personnel, multiple witnesses, corroborating evidence such as radar contact or photographs, etc. In order for a case to be deemed a &quot;known&quot;, only two analysts had to independently agree on a solution. However, for a case to be called an &quot;unknown&quot;, all four analysts had to agree. Thus the criterion for an &quot;unknown&quot; was quite stringent.

In addition, sightings were broken down into six different characteristics—color, number, duration of observation, brightness, shape, and speed and then these characteristics were compared between knowns and unknowns to see if there was a statistically significant difference.

The main results of the statistical analysis were:
* About 69% of the cases were judged known or identified (38% were considered conclusively identified while 31% were still &quot;doubtfully&quot; explained); about 9% fell into insufficient information. About 22% were deemed &quot;unknown&quot;, down from the earlier 28% value of the Air Force studies.
* In the known category, 86% of the knowns were aircraft, balloons, or had astronomical explanations. Only 1.5% of all cases were judged to be psychological or &quot;crackpot&quot; cases. A &quot;miscellaneous&quot; category comprised 8% of all cases and included possible hoaxes.
* The higher the quality of the case, the more likely it was to be classified unknown. 35% of the excellent cases were deemed unknowns, as opposed to only 18% of the poorest cases.

(More detailed statistics can be found at Identified flying objects.)

Despite this, the summary section of the Battelle Institute&#x27;s final report declared it was &quot;highly improbable that any of the reports of unidentified aerial objects ... represent observations of technological developments outside the range of present-day knowledge.&quot; A number of researchers, including Bruce Maccabee, who extensively reviewed the data, have noted that the conclusions of the analysts were usually at odds with their own statistical results, displayed in 240 charts, tables, graphs and maps. Some conjecture that the analysts may simply have had trouble accepting their own results or may have written the conclusions to satisfy the new political climate within Blue Book following the Robertson Panel.

When the Air Force finally made Special Report #14 public in October 1955, it was claimed that the report scientifically proved that UFOs did not exist. Critics of this claim note that the report actually proved that the &quot;unknowns&quot; were distinctly different from the &quot;knowns&quot; at a very high statistical significance level. The Air Force also incorrectly claimed that only 3% of the cases studied were unknowns, instead of the actual 22%. They further claimed that the residual 3% would probably disappear if more complete data were available. Critics counter that this ignored the fact that the analysts had already thrown such cases into the category of &quot;insufficient information&quot;, whereas both &quot;knowns&quot; and &quot;unknowns&quot; were deemed to have sufficient information to make a determination. Also, the &quot;unknowns&quot; tended to represent the higher quality cases, q.e. reports that already had better information and witnesses.

The result of the monumental BMI study was echoed by a 1979 French GEPAN report which stated that about a quarter of over 1,600 closely studied UFO cases defied explanation, stating, in part, &quot;These cases ... pose a real question.&quot; When GEPAN&#x27;s successor SEPRA closed in 2004, 5800 cases had been analyzed, and the percentage of inexplicable unknowns had dropped to about 14%. The head of SEPRA, , found the evidence of extraterrestrial origins so convincing in these remaining unknowns, that he wrote a book about it in 2005.

==Criticism==
Hynek was an associate member of the Robertson Panel, which recommended that UFOs needed debunking. A few years later, however, Hynek claimed that Air Force personnel were indifferent, incompetent, and conducted shoddy research. Hynek notes that during its existence, critics dubbed Blue Book &quot;The Society for the Explanation of the Uninvestigated.&quot; Regarding Ruppelt, Hynek wrote, &quot;In my contacts with him I found him to be honest and seriously puzzled about the whole phenomenon,&quot; and of Friend he wrote, &quot;Of all the officers I worked with in Blue Book, Colonel Friend earned my respect [and] conducted himself with dignity and a total lack of the bombast that characterized several of the other Blue Book heads.&quot; Hynek claimed that Quintanilla &quot;disregard[ed] any evidence that was counter to his hypothesis.&quot; Hynek also reported bitter exchanges with Moody, describing Moody as &quot;the master of the possible: possible balloon, possible aircraft, possible birds, which then became, by his own hand (and I argued with him violently at times) the probable.&quot;

Author and columnist Robert Sheaffer has written that Project Blue Book &quot;amassed 12,618 reports, and none of them amounted to anything significant, or added to our knowledge of any subject, even after more than 50 years of investigation.&quot;

==Project Blue Book in fiction==

===&quot;Project UFO&quot;===
Jack Webb produced and narrated &quot;Project UFO&quot;, a 1978-79 TV series based on Project Blue Book (though shifting the investigation to the present day rather than its original 1950s-60s era.)

The series followed two Air Force investigators, William Jordan as Major Jake Gatlin (replaced in the second season by Edward Winter as Major Ben Ryan), and Caskey Swaim as Staff Sergeant (later Technical Sergeant) Harry Fitz, covering a wide variety of UFO incidents.

A former Project Blue Book officer served as the technical advisor for the series. Each episode ended with the statement &quot;The United States Air Force, after twenty-two years of investigations, concluded that none of the unidentified flying objects reported and evaluated posed a threat to our national security.&quot; superimposed over the USAF seal.

===&quot;Twin Peaks&quot;===
Project Blue Book played a major role in the second season of the 1990–1991 TV series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. Major Garland Briggs, an Air Force officer who worked on the program, approaches protagonist Dale Cooper and reveals that Cooper&#x27;s name turned up in an otherwise nonsensical radio transmission intercepted by the Air Force, which inexplicably originated from the woods surrounding the town of Twin Peaks. As the season progresses, it is revealed that the source of the transmission is the transdimensional realm of the Black Lodge, inhabited by beings which feed on the human emotions of pain and suffering; it eventually comes out that Briggs worked with Cooper&#x27;s rival, corrupt FBI agent Windom Earle, on Project Blue Book, and that the two men apparently uncovered evidence of the Lodge during the course of their work.

===&quot;Galactica 1980&quot;===
Every episode of the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; spin-off series &quot;Galactica 1980&quot; ended with a short statement about the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s 1969 Project Blue Book findings that UFOs are not proven to exist and &quot;are not a threat to national security&quot;.

===&quot;Project Blue Book&quot; (2019)===
Project Blue Book is the inspiration for the drama series &quot;Project Blue Book&quot;, which began airing on the History Channel in January 2019.
