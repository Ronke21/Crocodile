<text>Miyuki Tanobe (born 1937 in Morioka, Japan) is a Japanese-born Canadian painter, based in Montreal, Quebec. She is known for her paintings of the everyday life of Montreal residents. Her work is in the collections of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the Musée du Québec, Lavalin, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and Shell Canada, and Selection du&quot; Reader’s Digest&quot;. She is a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.

==Early life and education==
Tanobe was born in 1937 in Morioka, Japan. Because there was a violent snowstorm raging on the day she was born, her parents named her Miyuki, which means &quot;deep snow&quot;. Tanobe attended Japanese primary and secondary schools.

In 1963, possessing incipient artistic gifts, she painted at the studio of La Grande Chaumière in Paris before registering at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, France&#x27;s leading school of fine arts. Miyuki Tanobe’s arrival in Canada in 1971 came as a result of a chance meeting in Paris with Maurice Savignac, her future husband, a French Canadian from Montreal.

==Work==

Miyuki Tanobe’s work reflects a freedom of action. She paints principally on rigid supports such as wood or masonite sheets. Her panels are filled with scenes that she has observed like children playing ice hockey.

Her modern primitive works depict everyday life in the working-class neighborhoods of Montreal with humour and great sensitivity. She transforms &quot;humble and unavoidable reality&quot; by reformulating it, adding or deleting elements depending on her assessment of their contribution to the scene. A painting by Miyuki Tanobe goes to the heart of the matter: the artist is interested in opening the viewers&#x27; eyes so that they may better see the familiar and adjust their perceptions of what they think they know.

In 1980 Tanobe illustrates the song &quot;Gens de mon pays&quot; by Gilles Vigneault and in 1983 she creates pictures for The Tin Flute by Gabrielle Roy.
The colours in Miyuki’s paintings are rich and full of contrast. Working with superimposed layers and applying pigments with her pliable, flexible Japanese brush, Miyuki Tanobe succeeds in revealing unexpected aspects of the objects and people she depicts without making them difficult to read. She paints in Nihonga.

She is a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.

In 2012 a mural was painted for Tanobe in Verdun.

==Collections==
Her work is found in the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec, Musée de Joliette, Musée Saidye Bronfman, Montréal.

==Recognition==
In 1979, she was the subject of a National Film Board of Canada documentary short &quot;My Floating World: Miyuki Tanobe&quot;, directed by Ian Rankin, Stephan Steinhouse and Marc F. Voizard.

<text>The Mall of New Hampshire is a shopping mall located in the Lower South Willow neighborhood of Manchester, New Hampshire. Its major anchoring stores are Macy&#x27;s, Old Navy, JCPenney, Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods, Best Buy, and Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s. The mall has 125 stores as well as a large food court and is , making it the third largest mall in New Hampshire after the Mall at Rockingham Park in Salem, and the Pheasant Lane Mall in Nashua, which opened in 1991 and 1986, respectively. This was the first large-scale shopping mall in New Hampshire; initial construction of the mall was completed in August 1977, though it has since been dramatically expanded.

The Mall of New Hampshire is managed by Simon Property Group, which owns 56.4 percent of it. The mall is also 44 percent owned by the CPP Investment Board, which manages the Canada Pension Plan national pension system.

The mall is located just off the South Willow Street exit (Exit 1) of Interstate 293, and has convenient access from the entire Golden Triangle of New Hampshire and portions of northeastern Massachusetts. Because of its location in south-central New Hampshire, the mall, along with other area malls draw a significant portion of its customer base from Massachusetts citizens, as well as residents of neighboring Maine and Vermont, wishing to take advantage of New Hampshire&#x27;s lack of sales tax.

==History==
The Mall of New Hampshire opened in August 1977 with Sears, Filene&#x27;s, and Lechmere as anchors.

The mall underwent a huge expansion and remodeling from late 1996 to early 1998. Sears was expanded in 1997 and remodeled. The original Filene&#x27;s was relocated to a newly built store in a newer wing of the mall in early 1997. The original Filene&#x27;s was demolished and rebuilt into a 2-level JCPenney in early 1998. The Lechmere closed in 1997 and became in 1998 a Best Buy and a Kitchen ETC. The food court was renovated in early 1998 and changed to a 550-seat food court. In 2006, as a result of the Federated/May merger, all Filene&#x27;s locations, including the one at the mall, were closed, followed by most of them, including the Mall of New Hampshire location changing over to Macy&#x27;s.

In April 2013, JCPenney went under another big renovation on both the top and bottom levels of their store, adding in a Sephora to help ease customers from going to the locations down at the Mall at Rockingham Park and the Pheasant Lane Mall.

In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off 235 of its properties, including the Sears at Mall of New Hampshire, into Seritage Growth Properties.

On August 22, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to 46 stores nationwide. The store closed in November 2018. On December 8, 2018, it was announced that Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods would be opening in half of the former Sears. The other half of the former Sears will become Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s. Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods opened on October 30, 2019, and Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s was originally scheduled to open on March 30, 2020, however it was delayed to August 24, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The former Sears Auto Center will be demolished for more parking spaces.

<text>An anodyne is a drug used to lessen pain through reducing the sensitivity of the brain or nervous system. The term was common in medicine before the 20th century, but such drugs are now more often known as analgesics or painkillers.
The term &quot;anodyne&quot; derives from Greek &quot;anōdynos&quot; (), from &quot;an-&quot; (, &quot;without&quot;) and &quot;odynē&quot; (, &quot;pain&quot;). Etymologically, the word covers any substance that reduces pain, but doctors used it more narrowly. Some definitions restrict the term to topical medications, including herbal simples such as onion, lily, root of mallows, leaves of violet, and elderberry. Other definitions include ingested narcotics, hypnotics, and opioids. In the 19th century, the primary anodynes were opium, henbane, hemlock, tobacco, nightshade (stramonium), and chloroform.

Certain compound medicines were also called by this name, such as anodyne balsam, made of castile soap, camphor, saffron, and spirit of wine, and digested in a sand heat. It was recommended not only for easing extreme pain, but also for assisting in discharging the diseased tissue that caused or occurred with the pain.

In literary usage, the word has escaped its strictly medical meaning to convey anything &quot;soothing or relaxing&quot; (since the 18th century) or even anything &quot;non-contentious&quot;, &quot;blandly agreeable&quot;, or unlikely to cause offence or debate.

<doc id="532245" wikidata="Q1430339" url="?curid=532245" title="Ozy and Millie">
<text>Ozy and Millie is a webcomic that ran from 1998 to 2008, created by Dana Simpson (originally published under D.C. Simpson). It follows the adventures of assorted anthropomorphic animals, centering on Ozy and Millie, two young foxes attending North Harbordale Elementary School in Seattle, Washington, contending with everyday elementary school issues such as tests and bullies, as well as more surreal situations.

The strip mostly concentrates on character interaction, but sometimes veers into commentary based on author Simpson&#x27;s own political views.

== Publication history ==
&quot;Ozy and Millie&quot; originally started as a printed comic strip in a Washington college newspaper, the &quot;Copper Point Journal&quot;, in 1997, with Simpson using ink and brush as drawing implements. Simpson claims to have been influenced by various comics and cartoons such as &quot;Bloom County&quot;, &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and &quot;Pogo&quot;.

It became an irregular webcomic in early 1998. In June that same year, it was changed to a Monday-Friday daily strip. The comic led Simpson to win the Scripps-Howard Foundation Charles M. Schulz College Cartoonist award and a College Media Advisors: Best Strip Cartoon award.

It is important to note that the strip has gone on hiatus several times. In 2000, the strip went on hiatus and returned with a new, unique style. Between January 30, 2004, and January 12, 2009, Simpson also ran another strip, &quot;I Drew This&quot;, a webcomic specifically about her political views (which are also slightly expressed in &quot;Ozy and Millie&quot;).

The comic was part of Keenspot from 2001 to 2003, going independent for several years before returning to Keenspot in November 2006. New strips were released on most weekdays, though the strip&#x27;s run ended in December of 2008. Since then, it has been re-run intermittently on GoComics.

Editorial cartoonist Ted Rall included six pages of interview illustrated with Ozy and Millie strips in &quot;&quot;.

==Collected editions==
Most of the strips have been reprinted in book form. They are published as follows:

*An incomplete five volume collection from Plan Nine Publishing, now out of print.
*A complete seven volume collection from Lulu.com, in paperback, that replaces the discontinued Plan Nine collection. It covers the entire run of the strip from 1997 to 2008.
*A complete two volume collection from Lulu.com, in paperback and hardcover: an alternative to the seven volume collection that also covers the entire run of the strip.
*A two-book best-of collection from Andrews McMeel Publishing, in paperback and hardcover, with each strip in full color for the first time.
‡ Volume 5 of the original printing by Plan Nine Publishing shares an ISBN with Orange Alert by John Robey, a webcomic printed by the same publisher.

==Characters==
===Ozy===
Ozymandias Justin Llewellyn is a ten-year-old anthropomorphic fox of an unidentified species (also called an &quot;Adolescent Gray Zen Fox&quot;) who attends North Harbordale Elementary School in Seattle with his friend, Millie. His full name, Ozymandias Justin Llewellyn, is a reference to the famous poem &quot;Ozymandias&quot; by Percy Bysshe Shelley.

Ozy is recognised by his large top hat, which he got from his adoptive father, Llewellyn. The only other clothing he wears is a vest, which makes him the target of some of Millie&#x27;s practical jokes. He is adept at letting Millie&#x27;s pranks pass by without effect, but he does suffer bullying at the hands of the school jock, Jeremy, who likes to stuff Ozy into trash cans. Ozy is also quiescent and serene, usually playing the &quot;straight person&quot;. Under Llewellyn&#x27;s guidance, Ozy also practices Zen (or rather, a humorous version of it).

===Millie===
Millicent Mehitabel Mudd, better known as Millie, is a ten-year-old red fox girl who is best friends with Ozy. Millie is usually seen wearing a set of blue denim overalls. Unlike Ozy, who is calm, Millie is chaotic and crafty, both in the destruction she leaves behind and the ways she devises of avoiding work (or attempting to). She is a rebel and is opposed to any form of authority, which regularly leads to confrontations with both her teacher, Ms. Sorkowitz, and her mother, Mililani Mudd. Although she is normally manic, she also has a strong sense of justice, facing the inexplicable wrongs of life and the world she sees. However, her rebellions are mostly limited to annoying her mother, playing jokes on Ozy and disrupting the peace at school; none of which matters any less to her, as long as she has fun doing it. She, like Ozy, often tries to answer the most important questions in life, but her method of finding the answers makes her unique.

===Llewellyn===
Ozy&#x27;s adoptive father, known only as Llewellyn, is a red dragon. Llewellyn and other members of his dragon family have been responsible for running several secret conspiracies. He also lends both Ozy and Millie advice, although his advice can tend to be nonsense. The words in his speech balloons are always in the Blackletter font, unlike most of the characters. Llewellyn married Millie&#x27;s Mother at the end of the Daily Strip. Of all the characters in &quot;Ozy and Millie&quot;, Simpson has claimed that Llewellyn is her favorite.

===Ms. Mudd===
Ms. Mililani Minerva Mudd, Millie&#x27;s mother, is a lawyer, who is an older, wiser, more temperate version of Millie. She was like Millie in her childhood, and as a result knows how to deal with any trouble caused by her, much to Millie&#x27;s annoyance. While Ms. Mudd knows how to deal with Millie, she is also the first to lend her support if there is anything amiss. She married Llewellyn at the end of the strip&#x27;s run in a story arc from November–December 2008. Her full name was revealed on October 1, 2008.

===Other characters===
Other characters in &quot;Ozy and Millie&quot; include Avery, a raccoon friend who constantly tries to be &quot;cool,&quot; even ditching his &quot;uncool&quot; friends on frequent occasions. Ironically, his friend, Stephan the aardvark, is rather the nerdiest character in the strip. Avery&#x27;s curious younger brother, Timulty, constantly undermines his coolness, although he simply likes being with him and his friends. The two major antagonists are Felicia the sheep, a &quot;popular girl&quot; who teases Millie for being too individualistic, and Jeremy the jock rabbit who bullies Ozy for few reasons.

Other minor characters include Ms. Sorkowitz, Ozy and Millie&#x27;s kangaroo teacher, and Principal Beau Vine, the bull principal of the school who allows bullying, believing that &quot;Repeated exposure to unprovoked assault squelches unhealthy nonconformist tendencies.&quot; Dr. I. Wahnsinnig (the German word for &quot;insane&quot; or &quot;mad&quot;) is a ring-tailed lemur and psychiatrist of the school who fights with Vine over school issues and frequently interacts with Millie. Ozy&#x27;s dragon cousin, Isolde, is known for her unusual methods in her job in journalism, and, like Llewellyn, is in charge of various conspiracies. Another character is Pirate Captain Locke, a child pirate from an alternate dimension on the other side of Llewellyn&#x27;s couch, in which people age backwards. Locke, currently the same age as Millie, is also her biological father.

==Reception==
Critic Fred Patten is one of the main supporters of the strip. In 2001, he wrote that the strip was, &quot;a gently humorous fantasy with a liberal political philosophy.&quot; In 2006, Patten still claimed that, &quot;&quot;Ozy and Millie&quot; is one of the top anthropomorphic cartoon strips on the Internet,&quot; although he did also comment negatively about the loss of colour in between changes of printed editions of books. The comic is also popular because of its relatively inoffensive content, with one person writing that it was, &quot;Suitable for readers of all ages, really.&quot; The strip (the books, specifically) has also received decent reviews from outside sources and other critics.

In 2002, the strip won the Web Cartoonist&#x27;s Choice Awards for &quot;Best Anthropomorphic Comic&quot;. &quot;Ozy and Millie&quot; also won the 2006 and 2007 Ursa Major Awards for &quot;Best Anthropomorphic Comic Strip&quot;. In 2009 (the year after she ended the strip), she won that year&#x27;s Comic Strip Superstar contest.

<text>The first Progressive Conservative Party of Canada [[leadership convention|leadership election]] was held in 1927, when the party was called the Conservative Party. Prior to then the party&#x27;s leader was chosen by the caucus or in several cases by the Governor General of Canada designating a Conservative MP or Senator to form a government after the retirement or death of an incumbent Conservative Prime Minister.

There have been two permanent leaders since 1927 who were not chosen by a leadership convention. Arthur Meighen agreed to serve a second term as leader in 1941 on condition that he would not have to contest the position. The party agreed since the party was desperate for a leader of Meighen&#x27;s stature. Jean Charest was one of only two Progressive Conservative Members of Parliament returned in the 1993 election and was appointed leader by the party&#x27;s executive with the decision later being affirmed at a regular party convention two years later. The Conservative Party became the Progressive Conservative Party in 1942.

All leadership conventions were delegated conventions, except in 1998 when a one member, one vote process was used in which each riding was allocated 100 points which were distributed among candidates by proportionally. For the 2003 leadership election, the party reverted to use of a delegated convention, ostensibly because of the cost of using a one member, one vote process (though it has been argued that the party feared that use of one member, one vote would make an outside takeover of the party easier due to a decline in membership). In 2003, the party merged with the Canadian Alliance to form a new Conservative Party of Canada. This party adopted the one member, one vote process the Tories had used in 1998.

Note on tables: Green box indicates winner. Pink box indicates candidate eliminated from ballot for receiving the fewest votes. Blue box indicates candidate withdrew from balloting.

==1927 Conservative leadership convention==

Held in Winnipeg, Manitoba on October 11, 1927.
George Halsey Perley, H. H. Stevens, John Allister Currie, John Baxter, Howard Ferguson, Edgar Nelson Rhodes, and outgoing leader Arthur Meighen were all nominated but declined to run.

==1938 Conservative leadership convention==

Held in Ottawa, Ontario on July 7, 1938.

Manion lost his seat in the 1940 federal election and R.B. Hanson became interim leader. In November 1941 a national conference of the party voted against having a leadership convention and instead appointed Arthur Meighen as the party&#x27;s wartime leader. Meighen was defeated in a 1942 by-election and resigned.

==1942 Progressive Conservative leadership convention==

Held in Winnipeg, Manitoba on December 11, 1942.

==1948 Progressive Conservative leadership convention==

Held in Ottawa, Ontario on October 2, 1948.

Wilfrid Garfield Case announced his candidacy but withdrew before the convention to support Drew.

==1956 Progressive Conservative leadership convention==

Held in Ottawa, Ontario on December 14, 1956.

==1967 Progressive Conservative leadership convention==

The 1967 leadership convention was held in Toronto, Ontario on September 9, 1967.

==1976 Progressive Conservative leadership convention==

The 1976 leadership convention was held in Ottawa, Ontario on February 22, 1976.

Richard Quittenton withdrew from the race before the convention began.

==1983 Progressive Conservative leadership convention==

The 1983 leadership convention was held in Ottawa, Ontario on June 11, 1983.

==1993 leadership convention results==

The 1993 leadership convention was held in Ottawa, Ontario on June 13, 1993.

==1995 Progressive Conservative leadership convention==
The 1995 leadership convention was held at the Palais des congrès de Gatineau in Hull, Quebec on April 29, 1995, to ratify Jean Charest as leader. Charest had been named interim leader following the 1993 federal election (and Kim Campbell&#x27;s resignation as party leader), which reduced the Progressive Conservatives to only two seats, with Charest being the only cabinet minister to win re-election.

==1998 Progressive Conservative leadership election==

First ballot was conducted October 24, 1998; second ballot was conducted November 14, 1998.

The 1998 election used a point system that allocated 100 points to each riding, regardless of the number of votes cast in the riding. The candidate who won a majority of points (not necessarily a majority of voters) would win the leadership. All party members were eligible to cast a vote. The 100-point-per-riding system was again used by the Conservative Party of Canada in its 2004 leadership race.

==2003 Progressive Conservative leadership convention==

The 2003 leadership convention was held in Toronto, Ontario on May 31, 2003.

Two other candidates had participated in the race. Quebec MP André Bachand withdrew his candidacy from the race due to financial concerns and backed Peter MacKay. Former Cabinet Minister and Quebec MP Heward Grafftey also withdrew his candidacy from the race due to health concerns.

<doc id="532251" wikidata="Q3179178" url="?curid=532251" title="The Herald (Glasgow)">
<text>The Herald is a Scottish broadsheet newspaper founded in 1783. &quot;The Herald&quot; is the longest running national newspaper in the world and is the eighth oldest daily paper in the world. The title was simplified from &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; in 1992. Following the closure of the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot;, the &quot;Herald on Sunday&quot; was launched as a Sunday edition on 9 September 2018.

==History==
===Founding===
The newspaper was founded by an Edinburgh-born printer called John Mennons in January 1783 as a weekly publication called the &quot;Glasgow Advertiser&quot;. Mennons&#x27; first edition had a global scoop: news of the treaties of Versailles reached Mennons via the Lord Provost of Glasgow just as he was putting the paper together. War had ended with the American colonies, he revealed. &quot;The Herald&quot;, therefore, is as old as the United States of America, give or take an hour or two.

The story was, however, only carried on the back page. Mennons, using the larger of two fonts available to him, put it in the space reserved for late news.

===First sale and renaming===
In 1802, Mennons sold the newspaper to Benjamin Mathie and James McNayr, former owner of the &quot;Glasgow Courier&quot;, which along with the &quot;Mercury&quot;, was one of two papers Mennons had come to Glasgow to challenge. Mennons&#x27; son Thomas retained an interest in the company. The new owners changed the name to &quot;The Herald and Advertiser and Commercial Chronicle&quot; in 1803. In 1805 the name changed again, this time to &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; when Thomas Mennons severed his ties to the paper.

===George Outram===
From 1836 to 1964, &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; was owned by George Outram &amp; Co. becoming one of the first daily newspapers in Scotland in 1858. The company took its name from the paper&#x27;s editor of 19 years, George Outram, an Edinburgh advocate best known in Glasgow for composing light verse. Outram was an early Scottish nationalist, a member of the National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights. &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot;, under Outram, argued that the promised privileges of the Treaty of Union had failed to materialise and demanded that, for example, that the heir to the British throne be called &quot;Prince Royal of Scotland&quot;. &quot;Any man calling himself a Scotsman should enrol in the National Association,&quot; said &quot;The Herald&quot;.

===Later years===
In 1895, the publication moved to a building in Mitchell Street designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, which now houses the architecture centre, The Lighthouse. In 1988, the publication moved to offices in Albion Street in Glasgow into the former &quot;Scottish Daily Express&quot; building. It is now based in a purpose-built building in Renfield Street, Glasgow.

One of the most traumatic episodes in the history of &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; was the battle for control and ownership of the paper in 1964. Two multi-millionaires, The 1st Baron Fraser of Allander and The 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet, whose newspaper empire included &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot;″s archrival, &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, fought for control of the title for 52 days. Lord Fraser of Allander won. The paper&#x27;s then editor, James Holburn, was a &quot;disapproving onlooker&quot;. The Labour Party condemned the battle as &quot;big business at its worst&quot;.

The newspaper changed its name to &quot;The Herald&quot; on 3 February 1992, dropping Glasgow from its title, but not its masthead. That same year the title was bought by Caledonia Newspaper Publishing &amp; Glasgow. In 1996, it was purchased by Scottish Television (STV; later called the Scottish Media Group). the newspaper along with its related publications, the &quot;Evening Times&quot; and &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; (now defunct), were owned by the Newsquest media group, part of Gannett.

==Notable people==
===Editorship===
Graeme Smith assumed editorship of &quot;The Herald&quot; in January 2017, replacing Magnus Llewellin, who had held the post since 2012. Notable past editors include: John Mennons, 1782; Samuel Hunter, 1803; George Outram, 1836; James Pagan, 1856; William Jack FRSE (1870–1876); James Holburn 1955–1965; George MacDonald Fraser, 1964; Alan Jenkins, 1978; Arnold Kemp 1981; Mark Douglas-Home, 2000; and Charles McGhee, 2006.

===Columnists===
Prominent columnists include Alison Rowat, who covers everything from television to international statecraft; former Scottish justice secretary and SNP politician Kenny MacAskill Kevin McKenna and David Pratt and business editor Ian McConnell, both multi-award-winning journalists, provide analysis of their fields every Friday.

===&quot;The Herald&quot; Diary===
Currently edited by Lorne Jackson, the column has been spun off in to a popular series of books since the 1980s. &quot;The Herald&quot; Diary used to be edited by writer Tom Shields. Sean Connery once said: &quot;First thing each morning I turn to &quot;The Herald&quot; on my computer – first for its witty Diary, which helps keep my Scots sense of humour in tune.&quot;

==Publishing and circulation==
It is currently printed at Carmyle, just south east of Glasgow. The paper is published Monday to Saturday in Glasgow and as of 2017 it had an audited circulation of 28,900. &quot;The Herald&quot;″s website is protected by a paywall. It is part of the Newsquest Scotland stable of sites, which have 41m page views a month.

==Political stance==
&quot;The Herald&quot; declares in every edition that it does not endorse any political party. However, the newspaper backed a &#x27;No&#x27; vote in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence. The accompanying headline stated, &quot;&quot;The Herald&quot;″s view: we back staying within UK, but only if there&#x27;s more far-reaching further devolution.&quot;

<doc id="532253" wikidata="Q729623" url="?curid=532253" title="C-type asteroid">
<text>C-type (carbonaceous ) asteroids are the most common variety, forming around 75% of known asteroids. They are volatile-rich and distinguished by a very low albedo because their composition includes a large amount of carbon, in addition to rocks and minerals. They have an average density of about .

They lie most often at the outer edge of the asteroid belt, from the Sun, where 80% of the asteroids are of this type, whereas only 40% of asteroids at from the Sun are C-type. The proportion of C-types may actually be greater than this, since C-types are much darker (and hence less detectable) than most other asteroid types, except for D-types and others that lie mostly at the extreme outer edge of the asteroid belt.

==Characteristics==
Asteroids of this class have spectra very similar to those of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites (types CI and CM). The latter are very close in chemical composition to the Sun and the primitive solar nebula minus hydrogen, helium and other volatiles. Hydrated (water-containing) minerals are present.

C-type asteroids are extremely dark, with albedos typically in the 0.03 to 0.10 range. Consequently, whereas a number of S-type asteroids can normally be viewed with binoculars at opposition, even the largest C-type asteroids require a small telescope. The potentially brightest C-type asteroid is 324 Bamberga, but that object&#x27;s very high eccentricity means it rarely reaches its maximum magnitude.

Their spectra contain moderately strong ultraviolet absorption at wavelengths below about 0.4 μm to 0.5 μm, while at longer wavelengths they are largely featureless but slightly reddish. The so-called &quot;water&quot; absorption feature of around 3 μm, which can be an indication of water content in minerals, is also present.

Due to their volatile-rich (icy) composition, C-type asteroids have relatively low density. A survey of 20 C-type asteroids found an average density of .

The largest unequivocally C-type asteroid is 10 Hygiea, although the SMASS classification places the largest asteroid, 1 Ceres, here as well, because that scheme lacks a G-type.

== C-group classifications ==

=== C-group (Tholen) ===

In the Tholen classification, the C-type is grouped along with three less numerous types into a wider C-group of carbonaceous asteroids which contains:
* B-type
* C-type
* F-type
* G-type

=== C-group (SMASS) ===

In the SMASS classification, the wider C-group contains the types:
* B-type corresponding to the Tholen B and F-types
* a core C-type for asteroids having the most &quot;typical&quot; spectra in the group
* Cg and Cgh types corresponding to the Tholen G-type
* Ch type with an absorption feature around 0.7μm
* Cb type corresponding to transition objects between the SMASS C and B types

<text>M-type (metallic-type, aka M-class) asteroids are a spectral class of asteroids which appear to contain higher concentrations of metal phases (e.g. iron-nickel) than other asteroid classes, and are widely thought to be the source of iron meteorites.

==Definition ==
Asteroids are classified as M-type based upon their generally featureless and flat to red-sloped absorption spectra in the visible to near-infrared and their moderate optical albedo. Along with the spectrally similar E-type and P-type asteroids (both categories E and P were formerly type-M in older systems), they are included in the larger X-type asteroid group and are distinguishable only by optical albedo:

==Characteristics==
===Composition===
Although widely assumed to be metal-rich (the reason for use of &quot;M&quot; in the classification), the evidence for a high metal content in the M-type asteroids is only indirect, though highly plausible. Their spectra are similar to those of iron meteorites and enstatite chondrites, and radar observations have shown that their radar albedos are much higher than other asteroid classes, consistent with the presence of higher density compositions like iron-nickel. Nearly all of the M-types have radar albedos at least twice as high as the more common S- and C-type, and roughly one-third have radar albedos ~3× higher.

High resolution spectra of the M-type have sometimes shown subtle features longward of 0.75 μm and shortward of 0.55 μm. The presence of silicates is evident in many, and a significant fraction show evidence of absorption features at 3 μm, attributed to hydrated silicates. The presence of silicates, and especially hydrated silicates, is at odds with the traditional interpretation of M-types as remnant iron cores.

===Bulk density and porosity===
The bulk density of an asteroid provides clues about its composition and meteoritic analogs. For the M-types, the proposed analogs have bulk densities that range from ~3 for some types of carbonaceous chondrites up to nearly 8 for the iron-nickel present in iron-meteorites. Given the bulk density of an asteroid and the density of the materials that make it up (aka particle or grain density), one can calculate its porosity and infer something of its internal structure; for example, whether an object is coherent, a rubble pile, or something in-between.

To calculate the bulk density of an asteroid requires an accurate estimate of its mass and volume; both of these are difficult to obtain given their small size relative to other solar system objects. In the case of the larger asteroids, one can estimate mass by observing how their gravitational field affects other objects, including other asteroids and orbiting or flyby spacecraft. If an asteroid possesses one or more moons, one can use their collective orbital parameters (e.g. orbital period, semimajor axis) to estimate the masses of the ensemble, for example in the two-body problem.

To estimate an asteroid&#x27;s volume requires, at a minimum, an estimate of an asteroid&#x27;s diameter. In most cases, these are estimated from the visual albedo (brightness) of the asteroid, chord-lengths during occultations, or their thermal emissions (e.g. IRAS mission). In a few cases, astronomers have managed to develop three-dimensional shape models using a variety of techniques (c.f. 16 Psyche or 216 Kleopatra for examples) or, in a few lucky instances, from spacecraft imaging (c.f 162173 Ryugu).
Of these, mass measurements made via spacecraft deflection or the orbits of moons are considered the most reliable. Ephemeris estimates are based on the subtle gravitational pull of other objects on that asteroid, or vice versa, and are considered less reliable. The exception to this caveat may be Psyche, as it is the most massive M-type asteroid and has numerous mass estimates. Size estimates based on shape models (usually derived from adaptive optics, occultations, and radar imaging) are the most reliable. Direct spacecraft imaging (Lutetia) is also quite reliable. Sizes based on indirect methods like thermal IR (e.g. IRAS) and radar echoes are less reliable.

None of the M-type asteroids have bulk densities consistent with a pure iron-nickel core. If these objects are porous (aka rubble-piles), then that interpretation may still hold; this is unlikely for Psyche, because of its large size. Given the spectral evidence of silicates on most M-type asteroids, the consensus interpretation for most of these larger asteroids is that they are composed of lower density meteorite analogs (e.g. enstatite chondrites, metal-rich carbonaceous chondrites, mesosiderites), and in some cases may also be rubble piles.

==Formation==
The earliest interpretation of the M-type asteroids was that they were the remnant cores of early protoplanets, stripped of their overlying crust and mantles by massive collisions that are thought to have been frequent in the early history of the solar system.

It is acknowledged that some of the smaller M-type asteroids (&lt;100 km) may have formed in this way, but that interpretation was challenged for 16 Psyche, the largest of the M-type asteroids. There are three arguments against Psyche forming in this way. First, it must have started as a Vesta-sized (~500 km) protoplanet; statistically, it is unlikely that Psyche was completely disrupted while Vesta remained intact. Second, there is little or no observational evidence for an asteroid family associated with Psyche, and third, there is no spectroscopic evidence for the expected mantle fragments (i.e. olivine) that would have resulted from this event. Instead, it has been argued that Psyche is the remnant of a protoplanet that was shattered and gravitationally re-accumulated into a well-mixed iron-silicate object. There are numerous examples of metal-silicate meteorites, aka mesosiderites, that might be objects from such a parent body.

One possible response to this second interpretation is that the M-type asteroids (including 16 Psyche) accumulated much closer to the Sun (1–2 au), were stripped of their thin crust/mantles while still molten (or partially so), and later dynamically moved into the current asteroid belt.

A third view is that the largest M-types, including 16 Psyche, may be differentiated bodies (like 1 Ceres and 4 Vesta) but, given the right mix of iron and volatiles (e.g. sulfur), these bodies may have experienced a type of iron volcanism, a.k.a. ferrovolcanism, while still cooling.

==Notable examples==
In the JPL Small Body Database, there are 980 asteroids classified under the Tholen asteroid spectral classification system. Of those, 38 are classified as M-type. Another 10 were originally classified as X-type, but are now counted among the M-types because their optical albedos fall between 0.1 and 0.3. Overall, the M-types make up approximately 5% of the asteroids classified under the Tholen taxonomy.

===(16) Psyche===
16 Psyche is the largest M-type asteroid with a mean diameter of 222 km, and has a relatively high mean radar albedo of formula_1 suggesting it has a high metal content in the upper few meters of its surface. The Psyche spacecraft was launched on october 13th, 2023 is en route to visit 16 Psyche, arriving in 2029.

===(21) Lutetia===
21 Lutetia has a mean diameter of 100 km, and was the first M-type asteroid to have been imaged by a spacecraft when the Rosetta space probe visited it on 10 July 2010. Its mean radar albedo of formula_2 is roughly twice that of the average S-type or C-type asteroid, and suggests its regolith contains an elevated amount of metal phases relative to other asteroid classes. Analysis using data from the Rosetta spectrometer (VIRTIS) was consistent with estatitic or iron-rich carbonaceous chondritic materials.

===(22) Kalliope===
22 Kalliope is the second largest M-type asteroid with a mean diameter of 150 km. A single moon, named Linus, was discovered in 2001 and allows for an accurate mass estimate. Unlike most of the M-type asteroids, Kalliope&#x27;s radar albedo is 0.15, similar to the S- and C-type asteroids, and does not suggest an enrichment of metal in its regolith. It has been the target of high resolution adaptive optics imaging which has been used to provide a reliable size and shape, and a relatively high bulk density of 4.1 .

===(216) Kleopatra===
216 Kleopatra, with a mean diameter of 122 km, is the third largest M-type asteroid known after 16 Psyche and 22 Kalliope. Radar delay-Doppler imaging, high-resolution telescopic images, and several stellar occultations show it to be a contact binary asteroid with a shape commonly referred to as a &quot;dog-bone&quot; or &quot;dumbbell.&quot; Radar observations from the Arecibo radar telescope indicate a very high radar albedo of formula_3 in the southern hemisphere, consistent with a metal-rich composition. Kleopatra is also notable for the presence of two small moons, named Alexhelios and Cleoselena, which have allowed its mass and bulk density to be accurately computed.

<text>E-type (enstatite achondrite–type) asteroids are asteroids thought to have enstatite (MgSiO3) achondrite surfaces. They form a large proportion of asteroids inward of the asteroid belt known as Hungaria asteroids, but rapidly become very rare as the asteroid belt proper is entered. Some are quite far from the inner edge of the asteroid belt, such as 64 Angelina. They are thought to have originated from the highly reduced mantle of a differentiated asteroid.

==Description==
E-type asteroids have a high albedo (0.3 or higher), which distinguishes them from the more common M-type asteroids. Their spectrum is featureless flat to reddish. Probably because they originated from the edge of a larger parent body rather than a core, E-types are all small, with only three (44 Nysa, 55 Pandora, 64 Angelina) having diameters above 50 kilometres and no others above 25 kilometers (the biggest three also orbit atypically far, c. 3 AU, from the Sun). Aubrites (enstatite achondrite meteorites) are believed to come from E-type asteroids, because Aubrites could be linked to the E-type asteroid 3103 Eger.

This grouping may be related to the Xe-type of the SMASS classification.

==E-Belt==

The E-type asteroids of the Hungaria family are thought to be the remains of the hypothetical E-belt asteroid population. The dispersal of most of that hypothetical E-Belt might have been caused by the outward migration of the gas giants of the Solar System according to simulations done under the Nice model – and these dispersed E-Belt asteroids might in turn have been the impactors of the Late Heavy Bombardment.

==Exploration==
On September 5, 2008, ESA&#x27;s robotic spaceprobe Rosetta visited the E-type asteroid 2867 Šteins. Spectral data from the spacecraft confirmed the asteroid was composed mainly of iron-poor minerals such as enstatite (magnesium-rich pyroxene), forsterite (magnesium-rich olivine) and feldspar.

<doc id="532256" wikidata="Q428121" url="?curid=532256" title="Seventy (Latter Day Saints)">
<text>Seventy is a priesthood office in the Melchizedek priesthood of several denominations within the Latter Day Saint movement, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Traditionally, a Latter Day Saint holding this priesthood office is a &quot;traveling minister&quot; and an &quot;especial witness&quot; of Jesus Christ, charged with the mission of preaching the gospel to the entire world under the direction of the Twelve Apostles. Latter Day Saints teach that the office of seventy was anciently conferred upon the seventy disciples mentioned in the Gospel of Luke . Multiple individuals holding the office of seventy are referred to collectively as &quot;seventies&quot;.

==Place in Latter-day Saint hierarchy==
In practical terms, the priesthood office of seventy is one which has varied widely over the course of history. As originally envisioned by Latter-day Saint movement founder Joseph Smith in the 1830s, the seventy were to be a body composed of several separate quorums of up to 70 seventies each, all of which would be led by seven presidents. These presidents, chosen from the first quorum, would appoint and direct the other quorums of seventy.

In the LDS Church, the largest of the Latter Day Saint denominations, the quorums of the seventy are directed and supervised hierarchically by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who are in turn directed by the First Presidency. As introduced by Smith, the apostles and the seventy had authority only outside the main body of Latter-day Saints in Zion, and in the outlying stakes. Members in Zion and the stakes were led by the High Council of Zion (under the direction of the First Presidency) and stake high councils.

As a body, the seventy in the LDS Church are considered to be equal in priesthood authority with the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. This presumably means that if the apostles were killed or incapacitated, the seventy could take over the function of the apostles. However, in such circumstances, the seventy would be required to act unanimously.

==Early Latter-day Saint quorums of seventy==
The First Quorum of the Seventy came into being in 1835 when seven men were set apart as the First Seven Presidents of the Seventy.

In 1837, six of the seven presidents were released because it was discovered that they had previously been ordained high priests. Five of these men were ultimately replaced by others. The other two—Levi W. Hancock and Joseph Young—remained members of the First Seven Presidents for the rest of their lives.

==The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==

Since 2020, the Quorums of the Seventy in the LDS Church have been organized into twelve quorums with a presidency of seven. The seventy act as emissaries of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and First Presidency of the church in organizing, training, proselytizing, and administering to millions of people scattered all across the globe. The seventy are the layer between local church administration and general church administration.

Members of the First and the Second Quorums of the Seventy are general authorities of the church with responsibilities covering the church as a whole.

Members of the Third through Twelfth Quorums of the Seventy are called an area seventy and are ordained to the priesthood office of seventy, but they are not general authorities of the church. Area seventies generally have authority only within a geographical unit of the church called an area.

== Community of Christ ==
Within Community of Christ, a seventy is also considered to be an elder but is not a High Priest. Part of the function of the seventy is a missionary role and he or she works closely with the apostle in charge of his or her mission field. Seventies are organized into nine quorums; each quorum being presided over by a president. These presidents make up the Council of Presidents of Seventy and are collectively led by the Senior President of the Presidents of Seventy. All nine quorums are equal with one another. When someone is ordained a seventy, that person automatically becomes a member of one of the Nine Quorums, and remains a member of one of the Quorums (although the specific quorum may change based on residency) so long as that person remains a seventy. In other words, it is not possible to be a seventy and not belong to one of these quorums.

The current roster of Presidents of Seventy include:

*Africa Quorum - Larry M. McGuire
*Canada, Dominican Republic, &amp; Mexico Quorum - John F. Glazer
*Central &amp; South America Quorum - Humberto Rosario del Rosario
*Eurasia Quorum - Joey S. Williams
*Pacific Asia Quorum - Adam R. Wade
*South Central Asia Quorum - Larry M. McGuire
*Central &amp; Northeast USA Quorum - Joelle Wight
*North Central &amp; Western USA Quorum - Karin F. Peter, Senior President of Seventy
*Southern USA Quorum - Larry M. McGuire

Historically, there have always been seven quorums, with a maximum of 70 members each. However, on January 17, 2010, Prophet-President Stephen M. Veazey announced that the number of quorums (and presidents) could be flexible, based on the current needs of the church. The change from seven to ten quorums occurred after the acceptance of Doctrine and Covenants section 164 at the World Conference in April 2010.

== The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)==
The seventy in this church are called the Seventy Evangelists and strictly limited to that number. They are ordained evangelists, not seventies. Missionary work is the focus of this calling in The Church of Jesus Christ.

== Apostolic United Brethren ==
There is currently one functioning Quorum of Seventy in the Apostolic United Brethren. Its members are distributed geographically among AUB congregations, with men ordained to this office called for life.

<doc id="532259" wikidata="Q1527816" url="?curid=532259" title="Grating">
<text>A grating is any regularly spaced collection of essentially identical, parallel, elongated elements. Gratings usually consist of a single set of elongated elements, but can consist of two sets, in which case the second set is usually perpendicular to the first (as illustrated). When the two sets are perpendicular, this is also known as a (as in grid paper) or a mesh.

== As filters ==
A grating covering a drain (as illustrated) can be a collection of iron bars (the identical, elongated elements) held together (to ensure the bars are parallel and regularly spaced) by a lighter iron frame. Gratings over drains and air vents are used as filters, to block movement of large solids (e.g. people) and to allow movement of liquids. A register is a type of grating used in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, which transmits air, while stopping solid objects.
== As decking ==

Grating can also come in s that are often used for decks on bridges, footbridges and catwalks. Grating can be made of materials such as steel, aluminum, fiberglass. Fiberglass grating is also known as FRP grating. They are used to optimize bending stiffness while minimizing weight.
==Optical grating==

As optical elements, optical gratings are images having the characteristic pattern of alternating, parallel lines. The lines alternate between high and low reflectance (black-white gratings) or high and low transmittance (transparent-opaque gratings). The grating profile is the function of the reflectance or transmittance perpendicular to the lines. This function is generally a square wave, in that every transition between lines is abrupt. 

A grating can be defined by six parameters:
* &quot;Spatial frequency&quot; is the number of cycles occupying a particular distance (e.g. 10 line pairs per millimeter). The period of the grating is the inverse of the spatial frequency, measured in distance (e.g. 0.1 mm).
* &quot;Duty Cycle&quot; is the relative thickness of high and low lines. The duty cycle is the ratio of the width of the low line (black or opaque) to one whole grating period.
* &quot;Profile&quot; is the shape of the repeating pattern, which is typically a square wave but can also be any periodic pattern (sine wave, triangle wave, sawtooth wave, etc.).
* &quot;Contrast&quot; is a measure of the difference in luminance between the high lines of the grating and the low lines. It is usually expressed as Michelson contrast: the difference between maximum and minimum luminance divided by their sum.
* &quot;Orientation&quot; is the angle the grating makes with some reference orientation (such as the y-axis in a picture or of another grating). It is usually measured in degree or in radians.
* &quot;Phase&quot; is the position of the grating profile relative to some reference position. It is usually measured in degrees (from 0 to 360 for one complete cycle) or in radians (2π for one complete cycle). For example, two identical transparent gratings of 50% duty cycle and the same orientation will appear fully opaque only if the relative phase is π (180 degrees).

Gratings with sine wave profiles are used extensively in optics to determine the transfer functions of lenses. A lens will form an image of a sine wave grating that is still sinusoidal, but with some reduction in its contrast depending on the spatial frequency and possibly some change in phase. The branch of mathematics dealing with this part of optics is Fourier analysis while the associated branch of study is Fourier optics. Gratings are also used extensively in research into visual perception. Campbell and Robson promoted using sine-wave gratings by arguing that the human visual performs a Fourier analysis on retinal images.

===Diffraction gratings===

Grating can also refer to a diffraction grating: a reflecting or transparent optical component on which there are many fine, parallel, equally spaced grooves. They disperse light, so are one of the main functional components in many kinds of spectrometers, which decompose a light source into its constituent wavelength components.

<text>A chondrite is a stony (non-metallic) meteorite that has not been modified by either melting or differentiation of the parent body. They are formed when various types of dust and small grains in the early Solar System accreted to form primitive asteroids. Some such bodies that are captured in the planet&#x27;s gravity well become the most common type of meteorite by arriving on a trajectory toward the planet&#x27;s surface. Estimates for their contribution to the total meteorite population vary between 85.7% and 86.2%.

Their study provides important clues for understanding the origin and age of the Solar System, the synthesis of organic compounds, the origin of life and the presence of water on Earth. One of their characteristics is the presence of chondrules (from the Ancient Greek χόνδρος &quot;chondros&quot;, grain), which are round grains formed in space as molten or partially molten droplets of distinct minerals. Chondrules typically constitute between 20% and 80% of a chondrite by volume.

Chondrites can be distinguished from iron meteorites by their low iron and nickel content. Non-metallic meteorites that lack chondrules are achondrites, which are believed to have formed more recently than chondrites. There are currently over 27,000 chondrites in the world&#x27;s collections. The largest individual stone ever recovered, weighing 1770 kg, was part of the Jilin meteorite shower of 1976. Chondrite falls range from single stones to extraordinary showers consisting of thousands of individual stones. An instance of the latter occurred in the Holbrook fall of 1912, in which an estimated 14,000 stones grounded in northern Arizona.

== Origin and history ==

Chondrites were formed by the accretion of particles of dust and grit present in the primitive Solar System which gave rise to asteroids over 4.54 billion years ago. These asteroid parent bodies of chondrites are (or were) small to medium-sized asteroids that were never part of any body large enough to undergo melting and planetary differentiation. Dating using 206Pb/204Pb gives an estimated age of 4,566.6 ± 1.0 Ma, matching ages for other chronometers. Another indication of their age is the fact that the abundance of non-volatile elements in chondrites is similar to that found in the atmosphere of the Sun and other stars in our galaxy.

Although chondritic asteroids never became hot enough to melt based upon internal temperatures, many of them reached high enough temperatures that they experienced significant thermal metamorphism in their interiors. The source of the heat was most likely energy coming from the decay of short-lived radioisotopes (half-lives less than a few million years) that were present in the newly formed Solar System, especially 26Al and 60Fe, although heating may have been caused by impacts onto the asteroids as well. Many chondritic asteroids also contained significant amounts of water, possibly due to the accretion of ice along with rocky material.

As a result, many chondrites contain hydrous minerals, such as clays, that formed when the water interacted with the rock on the asteroid in a process known as aqueous alteration. In addition, all chondritic asteroids were affected by impact and shock processes due to collisions with other asteroids. These events caused a variety of effects, ranging from simple compaction to brecciation, veining, localized melting, and formation of high-pressure minerals. The net result of these secondary thermal, aqueous, and shock processes is that only a few known chondrites preserve in pristine form the original dust, chondrules, and inclusions from which they formed.


== Characteristics ==

Prominent among the components present in chondrites are the enigmatic chondrules, millimetre-sized spherical objects that originated as freely floating, molten or partially molten droplets in space; most chondrules are rich in the silicate minerals olivine and pyroxene.

Chondrites also contain refractory inclusions (including Ca–Al inclusions), which are among the oldest objects to form in the Solar System, particles rich in metallic Fe-Ni and sulfides, and isolated grains of silicate minerals. The remainder of chondrites consists of fine-grained (micrometre-sized or smaller) dust, which may either be present as the matrix of the rock or may form rims or mantles around individual chondrules and refractory inclusions. Embedded in this dust are presolar grains, which predate the formation of our solar system and originated elsewhere in the galaxy. The chondrules have distinct texture, composition and mineralogy, and their origin continues to be the object of some debate. The scientific community generally accepts that these spheres were formed by the action of a shock wave that passed through the Solar System, although there is little agreement as to the cause of this shock wave.

An article published in 2005 proposed that the gravitational instability of the gaseous disk that formed Jupiter generated a shock wave with a velocity of more than 10 km/s, which resulted in the formation of the chondrules.

== Chondrite classification ==

Chondrites are divided into about 15 distinct groups &quot;(see Meteorites classification)&quot; on the basis of their mineralogy, bulk chemical composition, and oxygen isotope compositions &quot;(see below)&quot;. The various chondrite groups likely originated on separate asteroids or groups of related asteroids. Each chondrite group has a distinctive mixture of chondrules, refractory inclusions, matrix (dust), and other components and a characteristic grain size. Other ways of classifying chondrites include weathering and shock.

Chondrites can also be categorized according to their petrologic type, which is the degree to which they were thermally metamorphosed or aqueously altered (they are assigned a number between 1 and 7). The chondrules in a chondrite that is assigned a &quot;3&quot; have not been altered. Larger numbers indicate an increase in thermal metamorphosis up to a maximum of 7, where the chondrules have been destroyed. Numbers lower than 3 are given to chondrites whose chondrules have been changed by the presence of water, down to 1, where the chondrules have been obliterated by this alteration.

A synthesis of the various classification schemes is provided in the table below.

=== Enstatite chondrites ===

Enstatite chondrites (also known as E-type chondrites) are a rare form of meteorite thought to comprise only about 2% of the chondrites that fall to Earth. Only about 200 E-Type chondrites are currently known. The majority of enstatite chondrites have either been recovered in Antarctica or have been collected by the American National Weather Association. They tend to be high in the mineral enstatite (MgSiO3), from which they derive their name.

E-type chondrites are among the most chemically reduced rocks known, with most of their iron taking the form of metal or sulfide rather than as an oxide. This suggests that they were formed in an area that lacked oxygen, probably within the orbit of Mercury.

=== Ordinary chondrites ===

Ordinary chondrites are by far the most common type of meteorite to fall to Earth: about 80% of all meteorites and over 90% of chondrites are ordinary chondrites. They contain abundant chondrules, sparse matrix (10–15% of the rock), few refractory inclusions, and variable amounts of Fe–Ni metal and troilite (FeS). Their chondrules are generally in the range of 0.5 to 1 mm in diameter. Ordinary chondrites are distinguished chemically by their depletions in refractory lithophile elements, such as Ca, Al, Ti, and rare earths, relative to Si, and isotopically by their unusually high 17O/16O ratios relative to 18O/16O compared to Earth rocks.

Most, but not all, ordinary chondrites have experienced significant degrees of metamorphism, having reached temperatures well above 500 °C on the parent asteroids. They are divided into three groups, which have different amounts of metal and different amounts of total iron: 
*H chondrite have high total iron and high metallic Fe (15–20% Fe–Ni metal by mass), and smaller chondrules than L and LL chondrites. They are formed of bronzite, olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase, metals and sulfides and ~42% of ordinary chondrite falls belong to this group &quot;(see Meteorite fall statistics)&quot;.
*L chondrites have low total iron contents (including 7–11% Fe–Ni metal by mass). ~46% of ordinary chondrite falls belong to this group, which makes them the most common type of meteorite to fall on Earth.
*LL chondrites have low total iron and low metal contents (3–5% Fe–Ni metal by mass of which 2% is metallic Fe and they also contain bronzite, oligoclase and olivine). Only 1 in 10 ordinary chondrite falls belong to this group.

An example of this group is the NWA 869 meteorite.

=== Carbonaceous chondrites ===

Carbonaceous chondrites (also known as C-type chondrites) make up less than 5% of the chondrites that fall on Earth. They are characterized by the presence of carbon compounds, including amino acids. They are thought to have been formed the farthest from the sun of any of the chondrites as they have the highest proportion of volatile compounds. Another of their main characteristics is the presence of water or of minerals that have been altered by the presence of water.

There are many groups of carbonaceous chondrites, but most of them are distinguished chemically by enrichments in refractory lithophile elements relative to Si and isotopically by unusually low ratios of 17O/16O relative to 18O/16O, when compared to Earth rocks. All groups of carbonaceous chondrites except the CH group are named for a characteristic type specimen:
*CI (Ivuna type) chondrites entirely lack chondrules and refractory inclusions; they are composed almost exclusively of fine-grained material that has experienced a high degree of aqueous alteration on the parent asteroid. CI chondrites are highly oxidized, brecciated rocks, containing abundant magnetite and sulfate minerals, and lacking metallic Fe. It is a matter of some controversy whether they once had chondrules and refractory inclusions that were later destroyed during formation of hydrous minerals, or they never had chondrules in the first place. CI chondrites are notable because their chemical compositions closely resemble that of the solar photosphere, neglecting the hydrogen and helium. Thus, they have the most &quot;primitive&quot; compositions of any meteorites and are often used as a standard for assessing the degree of chemical fractionation experienced by materials formed throughout the Solar System.
*CO (Ornans type) and CM (Mighei type) chondrites are two related groups that contain very small chondrules, mostly 0.1 to 0.3 mm in diameter; refractory inclusions are quite abundant and have similar sizes to chondrules.

**CM chondrites are composed of about 70% fine-grained material (matrix), and most have experienced extensive aqueous alteration. The much studied Murchison meteorite, which fell in Australia in 1969, is the best-known member of this group.
**CO chondrites have only about 30% matrix and have experienced very little aqueous alteration. Most have experienced small degrees of thermal metamorphism.
*CR (Renazzo type), CB (Bencubbin type), and CH (high metal) carbonaceous chondrites are three groups that seem to be related by their chemical and oxygen isotopic compositions. All are rich in metallic Fe–Ni, with CH and especially CB chondrites having a higher proportion of metal than all other chondrite groups. Although CR chondrites are clearly similar in most ways to other chondrite groups, the origins of CH and CB chondrites are somewhat controversial. Some workers conclude that many of the chondrules and metal grains in these chondrites may have formed by impact processes after &quot;normal&quot; chondrules had already formed, and thus they may not be &quot;true&quot; chondrites.
**CR chondrites have chondrules that are similar in size to those in ordinary chondrites (near 1 mm), few refractory inclusions, and matrix comprises nearly half the rock. Many CR chondrites have experienced extensive aqueous alteration, but some have mostly escaped this process.
**CH chondrites are remarkable for their very tiny chondrules, typically only about 0.02 mm (20 micrometres) in diameter. They have a small proportion of equally tiny refractory inclusions. Dusty material occurs as discrete clasts, rather than as a true matrix. CH chondrites are also distinguished by extreme depletions in volatile elements.
**CB chondrites occur in two types, both of which are similar to CH chondrites in that they are very depleted in volatile elements and rich in metal. CBa (subgroup a) chondrites are coarse grained, with large, often cm-sized chondrules and metal grains and almost no refractory inclusions. Chondrules have unusual textures compared to most other chondrites. As in CH chondrites, dusty material only occurs in discrete clasts, and there is no fine-grained matrix. CBb (subgroup b) chondrites contain much smaller (mm-sized) chondrules and do contain refractory inclusions.
*CV (Vigarano type) chondrites are characterized by mm-sized chondrules and abundant refractory inclusions set in a dark matrix that comprises about half the rock. CV chondrites are noted for spectacular refractory inclusions, some of which reach centimetre sizes, and they are the only group to contain a distinctive type of large, once-molten inclusions. Chemically, CV chondrites have the highest abundances of refractory lithophile elements of any chondrite group. The CV group includes the remarkable Allende fall in Mexico in 1969, which became one of the most widely distributed and, certainly, the best-studied meteorite in history.
*CK (Karoonda type) chondrites are chemically and texturally similar to CV chondrites. However, they contain far fewer refractory inclusions than CV, they are much more oxidized rocks, and most of them have experienced considerable amounts of thermal metamorphism (compared to CV and all other groups of carbonaceous chondrites).
*CL (Loongana type) chondrites are largely chondrules and CAIs, correspondingly low in matrix and volatiles, with trace elements resembling CR. Triple oxygen position near the CV-CK area.
*Ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites: A number of chondrites are clearly members of the carbonaceous chondrite class, but do not fit into any of the groups. These include: the Tagish Lake meteorite, which fell in Canada in 2000 and is intermediate between CI and CM chondrites; and Acfer 094, an extremely primitive chondrite that shares properties with both CM and CO groups.

=== Kakangari chondrites ===

Three chondrites form what is known as the K (Kakangari type) grouplet: Kakangari, LEW 87232, and Lea Co. 002. They are characterized by large amounts of dusty matrix and oxygen isotope compositions similar to carbonaceous chondrites, highly reduced mineral compositions and high metal abundances (6% to 10% by volume) that are most like enstatite chondrites, and concentrations of refractory lithophile elements that are most like ordinary chondrites.

Many of their other characteristics are similar to the O, E and C chondrites.

=== Rumuruti chondrites ===

Rumuruti (R) type chondrites are a very rare group, with only one documented fall out of almost 900 documented chondrite falls. They have a number of properties in common with ordinary chondrites, including similar types of chondrules, few refractory inclusions, similar chemical composition for most elements, and the fact that 17O/16O ratios are anomalously high compared to Earth rocks. However, there are significant differences between R chondrites and ordinary chondrites: R chondrites have much more dusty matrix material (about 50% of the rock); they are much more oxidized, containing little metallic Fe–Ni; and their enrichments in 17O are higher than those of ordinary chondrites. Nearly all the metal they contain is oxidized or in the form of sulfides. They contain fewer chondrules than the E chondrites and appear to come from an asteroid&#x27;s regolith.

== Composition ==

Because chondrites accumulated from material that formed very early in the history of the Solar System, and because chondritic asteroids did not melt, they have very primitive compositions. &quot;Primitive,&quot; in this sense, means that the abundances of most chemical elements do not differ greatly from those that are measured by spectroscopic methods in the photosphere of the sun, which in turn should be well-representative of the entire Solar System (note: to make such a comparison between a gaseous object like the sun and a rock like a chondrite, scientists choose one rock-forming element, such as silicon (Si), to use as a reference point, and then compare ratios. Thus, the atomic ratio of Mg/Si measured in the sun (1.07) is identical to that measured in CI chondrites).

Although all chondrite compositions can be considered primitive, there is variation among the different groups, as discussed above. CI chondrites seem to be nearly identical in composition to the sun for all but the gas-forming elements (e.g., hydrogen (H), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and noble gases: helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar) etc.). Other chondrite groups deviate from the solar composition (i.e., they are &quot;fractionated&quot;) in highly systematic ways:
*At some point during the formation of many chondrites, particles of metal became partially separated from particles of silicate minerals. As a result, chondrites coming from asteroids that did not accrete with their full complement of metal (e.g., L, LL, and EL chondrites) are depleted in all siderophile elements, whereas those that accreted too much metal (e.g., CH, CB, and EH chondrites) are enriched in these elements compared to the sun.
*In a similar manner, although the exact process is not very well understood, highly refractory elements like Ca and Al became separated from less refractory elements like Mg and Si, and were not uniformly sampled by each asteroid. The parent bodies of many groups of carbonaceous chondrites contain over-sampled grains rich in refractory elements, whereas those of ordinary and enstatite chondrites were deficient in them.
*No chondrites except the CI group formed with a full, solar complement of volatile elements. In general, the level of depletion corresponds to the degree of volatility, where the most volatile elements are most depleted.

== Petrologic types ==

A chondrite&#x27;s group is determined by its &quot;primary&quot; chemical, mineralogical, and isotopic characteristics (above). The degree to which it has been affected by the &quot;secondary&quot; processes of thermal metamorphism and aqueous alteration on the parent asteroid is indicated by its petrologic type, which appears as a number following the group name (e.g., an LL5 chondrite belongs to the LL group and has a petrologic type of 5). The current scheme for describing petrologic types was devised by Van Schmus and Wood in 1967.

The petrologic-type scheme originated by Van Schmus and Wood is really two separate schemes, one describing aqueous alteration (types 1–2) and one describing thermal metamorphism (types 3–6). The aqueous alteration part of the system works as follows:

* Type 1 was originally used to designate chondrites that lacked chondrules and contained large amounts of water and carbon. Current usage of type 1 is simply to indicate meteorites that have experienced extensive aqueous alteration, to the point that most of their olivine and pyroxene have been altered to hydrous phases. This alteration took place at temperatures of 50 to 150 °C, so type 1 chondrites were warm, but not hot enough to experience thermal metamorphism. The members of the CI group, plus a few highly altered carbonaceous chondrites of other groups, are the only instances of type 1 chondrites.
* Type 2 chondrites are those that have experienced extensive aqueous alteration, but still contain recognizable chondrules as well as primary, unaltered olivine and/or pyroxene. The fine-grained matrix is generally fully hydrated and minerals inside chondrules may show variable degrees of hydration. This alteration probably occurred at temperatures below 20 °C, and again, these meteorites are not thermally metamorphosed. Almost all CM and CR chondrites are petrologic type 2; with the exception of some ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites, no other chondrites are type 2.

The thermal metamorphism part of the scheme describes a continuous sequence of changes to mineralogy and texture that accompany increasing metamorphic temperatures. These chondrites show little evidence of the effects of aqueous alteration:

* Type 3 chondrites show low degrees of metamorphism. They are often referred to as unequilibrated chondrites because minerals such as olivine and pyroxene show a wide range of compositions, reflecting formation under a wide variety of conditions in the solar nebula. (Type 1 and 2 chondrites are also unequilibrated.) Chondrites that remain in nearly pristine condition, with all components (chondrules, matrix, etc.) having nearly the same composition and mineralogy as when they accreted to the parent asteroid, are designated type 3.0. As petrologic type increases from type 3.1 through 3.9, profound mineralogical changes occur, starting in the dusty matrix, and then increasingly affecting the coarser-grained components like chondrules. Type 3.9 chondrites still look superficially unchanged because chondrules retain their original appearances, but all of the minerals have been affected, mostly due to diffusion of elements between grains of different composition.
* Types 4, 5, and 6 chondrites have been increasingly altered by thermal metamorphism. These are equilibrated chondrites, in which the compositions of most minerals have become quite homogeneous due to high temperatures. By type 4, the matrix has thoroughly recrystallized and coarsened in grain size. By type 5, chondrules begin to become indistinct and matrix cannot be discerned. In type 6 chondrites, chondrules begin to integrate with what was once matrix, and small chondrules may no longer be recognizable. As metamorphism proceeds, many minerals coarsen and new, metamorphic minerals such as feldspar form.

Some workers have extended the Van Schmus and Wood metamorphic scheme to include a type 7, although there is not consensus on whether this is necessary. Type 7 chondrites have experienced the highest temperatures possible, short of that required to produce melting. Should the onset of melting occur the meteorite would probably be classified as a primitive achondrite instead of a chondrite.

All groups of ordinary and enstatite chondrites, as well as R and CK chondrites, show the complete metamorphic range from type 3 to 6. CO chondrites comprise only type 3 members, although these span a range of petrologic types from 3.0 to 3.8.

== Presence of water ==

These meteorites either contain a proportion of water or minerals that have been altered by water. This suggests that the asteroid from which these meteorites originate must have contained water. At the beginning of the Solar System this would have been present as ice and a few million years after the asteroid formed the ice would have melted allowing the liquid water to react with and alter the olivines and pyroxenes. The formation of rivers and lakes on the asteroid is thought to have been unlikely if it was sufficiently porous to allow the water to percolate towards its interior, as occurs in terrestrial aquifers.

It is thought possible that a proportion of the water present on the Earth comes from the impact of comets and carbonaceous chondrites with the Earth&#x27;s surface.

== Origin of life ==
Carbonaceous chondrites contain more than 600 organic compounds that were synthesized in distinct places and at distinct times. These organic compounds include: hydrocarbons, carboxylic acids, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, amines, amides, sulfonic acids, phosphonic acids, amino acids, nitrogenous bases, etc. These compounds can be divided into three main groups: a fraction that is not soluble in chloroform or methanol, chloroform soluble hydrocarbons and a fraction that is soluble in methanol (which includes the amino acids).

The first fraction appears to originate from interstellar space and the compounds belonging to the other fractions derive from a planetoid. It has been proposed that the amino acids were synthesized close to the surface of a planetoid by the radiolysis (dissociation of molecules caused by radiation) of hydrocarbons and ammonium carbonate in the presence of liquid water. In addition, the hydrocarbons could have formed deep within a planetoid by a process similar to the Fischer–Tropsch process. These conditions could be analogous to the events that caused the origin of life on Earth.
The Murchison meteorite has been thoroughly studied; it fell in Australia close to the town that bears its name on 28 September 1969. It is a CM2 and it contains common amino acids such as glycine, alanine and glutamic acid as well as other less common ones such as isovaline and pseudo-leucine.

Two meteorites that were collected in Antarctica in 1992 and 1995 were found to be abundant in amino acids, which are present at concentrations of 180 and 249 ppm (carbonaceous chondrites normally contain concentrations of 15 ppm or less). This could indicate that organic material is more abundant in the Solar System than was previously believed, and it reinforces the idea that the organic compounds present in the primordial soup could have had an extraterrestrial origin.

<doc id="532263" wikidata="Q1352600" url="?curid=532263" title="International Amateur Radio Union">
<text>The International Amateur Radio Union (IARU) is an international confederation of national organisations that allows a forum for common matters of concern to amateur radio operators worldwide, and collectively represents matters to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The International Amateur Radio Union was founded in 1925 and, as of July 2021, it is composed of 172 national member societies.

==History==
Following an informal meeting in 1924 of representatives from France, Great Britain, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Luxembourg, Canada, and the United States, a plan was formulated to hold an International Amateur Congress in Paris, France, in April 1925. This Congress was held for the purpose of founding an international amateur radio organization. The Congress was attended by representatives of 23 countries in Europe, Americas, and Asia. A constitution for the IARU was adopted on April 17, and the formation of the International Amateur Radio Union was ratified on April 18, 1925. In the current era, this is the date (April 18) on which World Amateur Radio Day is celebrated.
The protocol of the congress was written in English, French and Esperanto.

== Governance ==
The IARU has an elected President and Vice President, an appointed Secretary and other officials (including regional representatives) forming an Administrative Council. These office holders are presently Timothy Ellam, VE6SH (Canada), President; Ole Garpestad, LA2RR (Norway), Vice-President; and Joel Harrison, W5ZN (United States), Secretary. The IARU International Secretariat (IARUIS) is operated by a member society after election by members. Currently, the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) operates the IARUIS from its headquarters in Newington, Connecticut, US.

== Regional organisation ==

The IARU is organised into three regions, named Region 1, Region 2, and Region 3. These regions correspond to the regulatory regions used by the International Telecommunication Union. Each region has an Executive Committee, typically composed of a President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, and several Directors. These regional officers are elected by representatives from the member societies at triennial regional conferences. Coordinators may be appointed by the Executive Committee of their region to support particular areas within the region, or to promote certain amateur radio activities within the region. All three regions have appointed Coordinators for Amateur Radio Direction Finding, emergency communications, monitoring for electromagnetic interference, and radio propagation.

=== IARU Region 1 ===
IARU Region 1 includes the member societies representing amateur radio operators in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and northern Asia. IARU Region 1 has the largest number of member societies among the three IARU regions, and has been the source of several international initiatives. IARU Region 1 lobbying efforts led to the creation of the 30 meter, 17 meter, and 12 meter amateur radio bands, improving the standardization of reciprocal licensing, promoting Amateur Radio Direction Finding and initiating youth related activities, known as &quot;the Youngsters On the Air project&quot; (YOTA) 

Executive officers:
*President: Sylvain Azarian, F4GKR
*Vice-President: Hani Raad, OD5TE
*Secretary: Mats Espling, SM6EAN
*Treasurer: Andreas Thiemann, HB9JOE

=== IARU Region 2 ===
IARU Region 2 includes the member societies representing amateur radio operators in the Americas. The organization of IARU Region 2 was founded in 1964 when representatives from 15 national radio societies attended the First Panamerican Radio Amateur Congress in Mexico City, Mexico. Antonio Pita, XE1CCP was the region&#x27;s first elected president.

Executive officers:
*President: Ramón Santoyo, XE1KK
*Vice-President: José Arturo Molina, YS1MS
*Secretary: George Gorsline, VE3YV
*Treasurer: John Bellows, K0QB

===IARU Region 3===
IARU Region 3 includes the member societies representing amateur radio operators in Australia, most of Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Although most of their membership is located in other IARU regions, the American Radio Relay League and the Radio Society of Great Britain are full member societies of IARU Region 3. The ARRL represents amateur radio operators in American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Marianas, and other dependent territories in the Pacific Ocean. The RSGB represents amateur radio operators in the British Indian Ocean Territory. IARU Region 3 has a special emphasis on promoting the harmonization of license qualifications in an effort to promote easier reciprocal operations by amateur radio operators in the region.

Executive officers:
*President: Wisnu Widjaja, YB0AZ
*Secretary: Shizuo Endo, JE1MUI

=== Countries without IARU member societies ===

==GAREC - Global Amateur Radio Emergency Communications Conferences==

The Global Amateur Radio Emergency Communications Conference or &quot;GAREC&quot; is a yearly conference held by the International Amateur Radio Union for discussion of amateur radio operation during natural disasters and other emergencies with the motto, &quot;Saving lives through emergency communications&quot;. GAREC was first held in Tampere, Finland in 2005, coinciding with the adoption of the Tampere Convention, a globally binding emergency communications treaty that had been signed in Tampere in 1998. In later conferences, the venue has attempted to rotate in sequence through ITU Regions 1, 2 and 3 (though not necessarily in that particular order).

== Radiosport ==

The IARU organises and promotes radiosport activities throughout the world. The IARU promulgates the rules used for high-speed telegraphy and sponsors regional and world championships. The IARU also promulgates the rules used by most competitions in amateur radio direction finding, including IARU-sponsored regional and world championships. The IARU also sponsors the annual IARU HF World Championship in amateur radio contesting. The IARU does not directly administer any of these radiosport events, but authorises and sponsors them through host organisations.

== Operating Station and the WAC Award ==
The IARU maintains a radio station at its headquarters in Newington, Connecticut. Its callsign is NU1AW. As an amateur radio station licensed by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission the &quot;1&quot; stands for its location in the New England area. &quot;NU&quot; was taken from the pre-1928 era when amateurs made up their own prefixes, and informally used these letters to show they were in &quot;North America—USA&quot;. The &quot;AW&quot; suffix represents the connection with the American Radio Relay League, whose own station is W1AW. NU1AW is frequently active during amateur radio contests.

For many years the IARU has issued the Worked All Continents certificate to amateurs who contact fellow hams in the six permanently populated continental areas of the world. Special awards and endorsements for various bands and modes are also available.

<doc id="532264" wikidata="Q138908" url="?curid=532264" title="Bolshoi Theatre">
<text>The Bolshoi Theatre () is a historic opera house in Moscow, Russia, originally designed by architect Joseph Bové. Before the October Revolution it was a part of the Imperial Theatres of the Russian Empire along with Maly Theatre (&quot;Small Theatre&quot;) in Moscow and a few theatres in Saint Petersburg (Hermitage Theatre, Bolshoi (Kamenny) Theatre, later Mariinsky Theatre and others).

The Bolshoi Ballet and Bolshoi Opera are among the oldest and best known ballet and opera companies in the world. It is by far the world&#x27;s biggest ballet company, with more than 200 dancers. The theatre is the parent company of The Bolshoi Ballet Academy, a leading school of ballet. It has a branch at the Bolshoi Theater School in Joinville, Brazil.

The main building of the theatre, rebuilt and renovated several times during its history, is a landmark of Moscow and Russia (its iconic neoclassical façade is depicted on the Russian 100-ruble banknote). On 28 October 2011, the Bolshoi re-opened after an extensive six-year renovation. The official cost of the renovation is 21 billion rubles ($688 million). However, other Russian authorities and other people connected to it claimed much more public money was spent. The renovation included restoring acoustics to the original quality (which had been lost during the Soviet Era), as well as restoring the original Imperial decor of the Bolshoi.

== History ==



===Origins===
The company was founded on , when Catherine II granted Prince Peter Urusov a licence to organise theatrical performances, balls and other forms of entertainment. Urusov set up the theatre in collaboration with English tightrope walker Michael Maddox. Initially, it held performances in a private home, but it acquired the Petrovka Theatre and on 30 December 1780, it began producing plays and operas, thus establishing what would become the Bolshoi Theatre. Fire destroyed the Petrovka Theatre on 8 October 1805, and the New Arbat Imperial Theatre replaced it on 13 April 1808, however it also succumbed to fire during the French invasion of Moscow in 1812.

The first instance of the theatre was built between 1821 and 1824, designed and supervised to completion by architect Joseph Bové based upon an initial competition-winning design created by Petersburg-based Russian architect Andrei Mikhailov that was deemed too costly to complete. The new building opened on 18 January 1825 as the Bolshoi Petrovsky Theatre with a performance of the catalan Fernando Sor&#x27;s ballet, &quot;Cendrillon&quot;. Initially, it presented only Russian works, but foreign composers entered the repertoire around 1840.

===Renovations in the 19th century===

In 1843 a large-scale reconstruction of the theatre took place using a design by A. Nikitin, but a fire in 1853 caused extensive damage and so a further reconstruction was carried out, by Alberto Cavos, son of the opera composer Catterino Cavos. 

===20th century===

On 7 December 1919 the house was renamed the State Academic Bolshoi Theatre. Only a few days later, however, on 12 December, there was an unsuccessful attempt to shut the institution entirely. Beethoven Hall opened on 18 February 1921. Ivan Rerberg directed further reconstruction of the theatre between 1921 and 1923. A bomb damaged the structure during World War II, but this was repaired.

===New stage of 2002===

A new stage for the Bolshoi Theatre, called the New Stage, went into service on 29 November 2002, constructed to the left of the theatre&#x27;s historic main stage. Together with auxiliary buildings — a restored 17th-century building, two rehearsal halls, and artists&#x27; recreation rooms — it forms a single theatre complex, the Bolshoi Theatre of Russia. The new building is on a natural hill which it shared, until recently, blocks of old houses with communal apartments.

===Major rebuilding and renovation (2005–2011)===

From July 2005 to October 2011 the theatre was closed for restoration. The building, whose architecture combines three different styles, was damaged and a quick renovation seemed to be necessary.

Repairs were initially estimated at 15 billion rubles ($610 million) but engineers found that more than 75% of the structure was unstable, According to The Moscow Times, the true cost may have been double that, and Der Spiegel quotes a figure of $1.1 billion. The rebuilding and renovation was funded entirely by the federal government.

During the long period of reconstruction, the company continued to mount productions, with performances held on the New Stage and on the stage of the Great Kremlin Palace.

The renovation included restoring acoustics to the original quality (which had been lost during the Soviet Era), as well as restoring the original Imperial decor of the Bolshoi. After the renovation, the theater has a maximum capacity of 1,740 seats. Finally, on 28 October 2011, the Bolshoi Theatre re-opened with a concert featuring international artists and the ballet and opera companies. The first staged opera, Ruslan and Lyudmila, followed soon after.

===Notable premieres===
The Bolshoi has been the site of many historic premieres, including:
*Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Voyevoda&quot; and &quot;Mazeppa&quot;
*Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s one version of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; was given on 16 December 1888. 
*Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Aleko&quot; and &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot;
*Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s opera &quot;The Maid of Pskov&quot;, with Feodor Chaliapin singing the role of Ivan the Terrible
*Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s opera &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&quot; in 1935.

===Other notable facts===
*The first symphonic concert by the Bolshoi Orchestra took place at the Bolshoi Theatre on 4 May 1919, conducted by Serge Koussevitzky
* During the COVID-19 pandemic, at least 34 members of the theatre were infected.

==Ballet and opera==

The Bolshoi is a repertory theatre, meaning that it draws from a list of productions, any one of which may be performed on a given evening. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, there have been a few attempts to reduce the theatre&#x27;s traditional dependence on large state subsidies. The Bolshoi has been associated from its beginnings with ballet. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;Swan Lake&quot; premiered at the theatre on 4 March 1877. The chief ballet conductor from 1923 to 1963 was Yuri Fayer.

After the death of Joseph Stalin, the company toured internationally and became an important source of cultural prestige, as well as foreign currency earnings. As a result, the &quot;Bolshoi Ballet&quot; became a well-known name in the West. 

However, the Bolshoi suffered from losses through a series of defections of its dancers. The first occurrence was on 23 August 1979, with Alexander Godunov; followed by Leonid Kozlov and Valentina Kozlova on 16 September 1979; and other cases in the following years. Bolshoi continues to tour regularly with opera and ballet productions in the post-Soviet era. 
Until the mid-1990s, most foreign operas were sung in Russian, but Italian and other languages have been heard more frequently on the Bolshoi stage in recent years. 

In 2024 Bolshoi&#x27;s Ballet is arguably the best in the world. And it is the production and music of the Bolshoi that is considered both the original soundtrack and the best choreography for the legendary Nutcracker. 

==Orchestra==
Music director and chief conductor Vassily Sinaisky quit abruptly at the start of December 2013, after a 41-month tenure, citing the need to avoid conflict. General director Vladimir Urin accepted his resignation, and selected Tugan Sokhiev as replacement. Sokhiev&#x27;s four-year contract, settled on 20 January 2014, and became effective immediately. Sokhiev left his position in connection with the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. In December 2023, Valery Gergiev was appointed artistic director of the company, with immediate effect, with an initial contract of 5 years.

==Cultural status==

The Bolshoi Theatre attracts large numbers of tourists. As a result, prices can be much higher than in other Russian theatres.

==Controversies==
*The rebuilding and renovation cost was $1.1 billion, sixteen times the initial estimate. In 2009 prosecutors alleged the lead contractor was paid three times for the same work.
*Anastasia Volochkova, a former Bolshoi prima ballerina, has said she sees the theatre &quot;as a big brothel&quot; because, she has claimed, ballerinas are invited to parties by theatre administrators and refused roles if they do not accept.
*On 17 January 2013, Sergei Filin, the Bolshoi&#x27;s ballet director, was attacked with sulfuric acid and as a result lost much of his eyesight. A male dancer was later charged with the crime.
*In the area of box office, a theatre insider told the German publication Der Spiegel that tickets are often sold to mafia dealers, who in turn sell them on the black market for double the face value.
*Performance quality has been criticized by the former music director Alexander Vedernikov (2001-2009). He has claimed the Bolshoi Theatre was putting &quot;bureaucratic interests before artistic ones.&quot;
* July 8, 2017, three days before the premiere, the Bolshoi Theatre called off the premiere of a ballet about legendary dancer Rudolf Nureyev. The Director General Vladimir Urin claimed it was due to the bad quality of the dancing, however the principal dancer Maria Alexandrova claimed it was the first sign of a &#x27;new era&#x27; of censorship. It was the first time a show has been pulled in such a way since the collapse of the Soviet Union (where such censorship persisted), sparking rumours about the motivation behind it.

==Footnotes==
*The Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre used to exist in Saint Petersburg. It stood next to the Circus Theatre (rebuilt in 1860 as the Mariinsky Theatre), but was replaced in the 1890s by the present-day building of the St. Petersburg Conservatory. It was at St. Petersburg&#x27;s Bolshoi that the first great Russian operas, Glinka&#x27;s &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; and &quot;Ruslan and Lyudmila&quot;, premiered.
*In a bit of ideological editing, the Bolshoi Theatre appears to be &quot;destroyed&quot; by the device of a split screen in Dziga Vertov&#x27;s &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot;.

<text>Andy Merrill is an American voice actor best known for his portrayal of the character Brak on &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, &quot;The Brak Show&quot;, and &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot;; as well as Oglethorpe on &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;.

== &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; ==
Merrill joined Cartoon Network within several months of its inception in 1992, coming over from sister company CNN. He started working in programming, and in 1993 he and then head of programming Mike Lazzo helped put together the first animated late-night talk show, &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;. He voiced Space Ghost in the first of two unaired pilots for the show.

In April 1994, &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; premiered on Cartoon Network. The concept was that 1960s Hanna-Barbera cartoon superhero Space Ghost had retired from being a superhero and was hosting his own talk show, in which he interviewed live action celebrity guests, with his old archenemies Zorak and Moltar as band leader and director. To date, the show has had over 90 episodes aired on television, and was one of the motivating forces behind the creation of the Adult Swim programming bracket started in 2001. Merrill helped produce and write for the show for years, and voiced &quot;Council of Doom&quot; members Brak and Lokar, who would appear on the show periodically, mostly Brak.

Merrill, along with &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; friend and co-star George Lowe, wrote on social media that their friend and co-star C. Martin Croker died on September 17, 2016. It was then revealed that Adult Swim would play the first produced episode of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; aired 12:30 eastern, 11:30 central that night in honor of Croker&#x27;s contribution not only to &quot;Space Ghost&quot;, but many Adult Swim shows in both animation and voice overs. The three of them, along with Dave Willis, Dana Snyder, and Carey Means had been friends since their earliest Cartoon Network days.

== Cartoon Planet ==
In 1995, &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot; premiered on TBS (moving to Cartoon Network in 1996). Merrill wrote and produced the show, along with crew members who had worked on &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast,&quot; himself voicing the character of Brak. The main characters on &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot; were Space Ghost, Zorak, and Brak, and it was a show of skits and songs put together with the same limited animation used in &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;.

Originally, the skits and songs were filler for showing old cartoons owned by Turner Entertainment (Hanna-Barbera, &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;, &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot;) until the skits and songs became more popular and Brak developed more of a personality and grew popular with fans. The show eventually became entirely skits and songs.

== Brak spin-offs ==
In 2000, two &quot;Sonny and Cher&quot;-style variety show specials premiered on Cartoon Network, titled &quot;Brak Presents the Brak Show Starring Brak&quot;. The show featured new animation, and new songs with celebrity guests and fellow &quot;Space Ghost&quot; villain Zorak. However, the specials were met with mixed reviews from fans. In the early hours of December 21, 2000, a new sitcom parody cartoon premiered, titled &quot;Leave It to Brak&quot;, which was actually the pilot episode for the future Adult Swim show &quot;The Brak Show&quot;, which premiered on Adult Swim in 2001 and ran for three seasons.

Merill reprised Brak on the episode &quot;Space Con&quot; of the Max series &quot;Jellystone!&quot; which is also based on Hanna-Barbera characters.

== Boomerang ==
Merrill left Atlanta briefly, moving to New Jersey for a year and joining the programming department of Boomerang, an asset of the Turner Broadcasting System.

<text>&quot;M.T.A.&quot;, often called &quot;The MTA Song&quot;, is a 1949 song by Jacqueline Steiner and Bess Lomax Hawes. Known informally as &quot;Charlie on the MTA&quot;, the song&#x27;s lyrics tell an absurd tale of a man named Charlie trapped on Boston&#x27;s subway system, which was then known as the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA). The song was originally recorded as a mayoral campaign song for Progressive Party candidate Walter A. O&#x27;Brien. A version of the song with the candidate&#x27;s name changed became a 1959 hit when recorded and released by The Kingston Trio, an American folk singing group.

The song has become so entrenched in Boston lore that the Boston-area transit authority named its electronic card-based fare collection system the &quot;CharlieCard&quot; as a tribute to this song. The transit organization, now called the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), held a dedication ceremony for the card system in 2004 which featured a performance of the song by the Kingston Trio, attended by then-governor Mitt Romney.

== Overview ==

The Kingston Trio version begins with a spoken recitation by Dave Guard accompanied by a bowed bass fiddle: &quot;These are the times that try men&#x27;s souls. In the course of our nation&#x27;s history, the people of Boston have rallied bravely whenever the rights of men have been threatened. Today, a new crisis has arisen. The Metropolitan Transit Authority, better known as the MTA, is attempting to levy a burdensome tax on the population, in the form of a subway fare increase. Citizens, hear me out! This could happen to you.&quot;

The song&#x27;s lyrics tell of Charlie, a man who boards an MTA subway car, but then cannot get off because he does not have enough money for new &quot;exit fares&quot;. These additional charges had just been established to collect an increased fare without replacing existing fare collection equipment.


The song goes on to say that every day Charlie&#x27;s wife hands him a sandwich &quot;as the train comes rumbling through&quot; because he is stranded on the train. It is probably best known for its chorus:
After the third line of the chorus, in the natural break in the phrasing, audiences familiar with the song often call out &quot;Poor Old Charlie!&quot; or &quot;What a pity!&quot; 
As the song fades out, the words &quot;Et tu, Charlie?&quot; are spoken by Nick Reynolds, meaning &quot;You too, Charlie?&quot;

== History ==
The song, based on a much older version called &quot;The Ship That Never Returned&quot; (or its railroad successor, &quot;Wreck of the Old 97&quot;), was composed in 1949 as part of the election campaign of Walter A. O&#x27;Brien, a Progressive Party candidate for Boston mayor. O&#x27;Brien was unable to afford radio advertisements, so he enlisted local folk singers to write and sing songs from a touring truck with a loudspeaker (he was later fined $10 for &quot;disturbing the peace&quot;).

One of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s major campaign planks was to lower the price of riding the subway by removing the complicated fare structure involving exit fares—so complicated that at one point it required a nine-page explanatory booklet. The Progressive Party had opposed the public buyout of Boston&#x27;s streetcar system, which it argued enriched the previous private ownership and was followed by higher fares to city residents. In the Kingston Trio recording, the name &quot;Walter A. O&#x27;Brien&quot; was changed to &quot;George O&#x27;Brien&quot;, apparently to avoid risking protests that had hit an earlier recording, when the song was seen as celebrating a socialist politician.

== Geography ==
The song has Charlie boarding at the Kendall Square station (now called Kendall/MIT) and changing for Jamaica Plain. Kendall is on what is now the Red Line (the lines were not color-coded until 1965), so his &quot;change for Jamaica Plain&quot; would have been at Park Street. There, he would have boarded a #39 streetcar (later the Green Line E branch) for Jamaica Plain. In 1949, the line went all the way to Arborway in Jamaica Plain, but the line was truncated to Heath Street at the northern edge of Jamaica Plain in 1985.

The song further mentions that his wife visited him every day at Scollay Square, which today is Government Center on the Green Line.

===Music===
* The Chad Mitchell Trio song &quot;Super Skier&quot;, written by Bob Gibson, used the tune and although its lyrics have nothing to do with subways, ends with a call to &quot;get Charlie off the MTA&quot;.
* Boston-based punk rock band Dropkick Murphys wrote a variation, &quot;Skinhead on the MBTA&quot;, with a skinhead in place of Charlie, on their 1998 album &quot;Do or Die&quot;.
* The Front Porch Country Band recorded a song called &quot;The Man Who Finally Returned&quot; about Charlie getting off the MTA because the track&#x27;s renovation during the Big Dig.
* Bob Haworth, a member of The Kingston Trio, wrote and recorded a song called &quot;MTA Revisited&quot; in 2003.
* Fred Small wrote and recorded a parody called &quot;Sergei in the Milky Way&quot; with the true story of Soviet cosmonaut Sergei Krikalyov, who was temporarily stranded in space when the Soviet Union broke up. Small mimicked the Kingston Trio arrangement almost note for note.
* Frank Black sings &quot;You can&#x27;t get off your stop / Like old Charlie on the MTA&quot; in his song &quot;Living on Soul&quot;.
*In &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, the song was performed by Hal&#x27;s bluegrass group The Gentleman Callers, in the episode &quot;Long Drive&quot;.
* In response to the 2022 monthlong shutdown of the MBTA Orange Line, a group of local musicians gathered at Back Bay Station to perform a parody called &quot;Charlie (Baker) on the MBTA,&quot; with lyrics mocking the shutdown as well as Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker&#x27;s reputation for never utilizing public transit while in office. A clip from the performance was featured on &quot;All Things Considered&quot;&#x27;s segment about the shutdown.
* Dave Van Ronk recorded &quot;Georgie on the IRT&quot;, about a man who is decapitated by a closing door on the New York subway, leaving his body at Times Square while his head endlessly rides back and forth to Flatbush Avenue.

===Other===
* The computer scientist Henry Baker references the song in his paper &quot;CONS Should Not CONS Its Arguments, Part II: Cheney on the M.T.A.&quot;, which describes a way of implementing Cheney&#x27;s algorithm using C functions that, like Charlie, never return.
* The computer scientists Guy L. Steele Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman also make reference to the song in one of the Lambda Papers when discussing functions such as the Lisp driver loop which never returns, just like Charlie in the song.

<text>Jonadab is a figure in the Hebrew Bible, appearing in 2 Samuel 13. He is described in verse 3 as the son of Shimeah, who was the brother of David, making Jonadab a cousin to Amnon as well as his friend. He is called &quot;very wise&quot; (&quot;ḥākām mĕ&#x27;ōd&quot;), usually translated as &quot;very shrewd&quot; (NIV) or &quot;very crafty&quot; (ESV).

2 Samuel 13 describes how Amnon wanted to have Tamar, despite the fact that she was his half-sister. Jonadab advised Amnon to pretend to be sick, and then ask David to send Tamar to him to make him some food. Amnon followed Jonadab&#x27;s advice, and ended up raping Tamar.

Jonadab appears again at the end of the chapter, when he tells David of Absalom&#x27;s grudge against Amnon. Pamela Tamarkin Reis notes that he was &quot;privy to the confidence of both brothers&quot;, and suggests that he &quot;told Absalom about Amnon&#x27;s scheme simply because
he was a busybody, stirring his spoon in every pot.&quot;

According to the Babylonian Talmud: &quot;And Thou should not associate with a sinner:...And so we find with Amnon, who associated with Jonadab, the son of Shim&#x27;ah, David&#x27;s brother; and Jonadab was a very sensible man--sensible in wickedness, as it is written [Jer. Iv .22]: Wise are they to do evil.&quot; According to others, it is meant that one shall not associate with the wicked, even to study the Torah.&quot;

Keith Bodner suggests that &quot;among the numerous minor characters in 2 Samuel 11–19, Jonadab remains among the most enigmatic, and his malignancy marks a key juncture in the story.&quot;

<text>Capitol Air was a United States supplemental air carrier and, after 1978, a scheduled passenger air carrier based which was operational from 1946 to its bankruptcy filing on November 23, 1984. From 1964, supplemental air carriers were simply charter carriers. Until 1964, however, supplemental air carriers were a scheduled/charter hybrid. Supplemental air carriers were also known as irregular air carriers or nonscheduled carriers. The airline was founded as Capitol Airways in 1946, and renamed Capitol International Airways in 1967. In 1981, the airline changed its name to Capitol Air and was operating scheduled domestic and international passenger flights that year.

==History==
Capitol Airways was founded by Jesse F. Stallings (1909–1979), an airline captain, and Richmond Mclnnis, his associate. The company was incorporated in Tennessee on 11 January 1946. Capitol&#x27;s Letter of Registration (what such airlines had at the time in lieu of a certificate) was issued 11 August 1947. During the first few years, Capitol Airways operated a flight school and aircraft sales agency at Cumberland Field in Nashville, Tennessee.
By the early 1950s Capitol operated a fleet of piston engine transport planes including DC-3s and Lockheed Lodestars. Capitol Airways began to transport priority freight for the U.S. Air Force in 1954. By 1956, Capitol was operating a fleet of more than twenty Curtiss C-46 transport planes, and had become a primary civilian carrier for the military&#x27;s Logistic Air Support (LOGAIR) program. Capitol then entered the international charter flight market, operating a fleet of Lockheed Constellations. In February 1959, Capitol made New Castle Airport at Wilmington, Delaware its main operational base.

In 1963 Capitol Airways was one of the first charter airlines to operate jet aircraft in the form of a new Douglas DC-8. In 1964, a Capitol-operated DC-8 set a world record in commercial aviation by flying nonstop from Tokyo, Japan to Wilmington, Delaware in 12 hours and 25 minutes. During the 1960s, the airline&#x27;s civilian and military air cargo operations increased.
In 1967 Capitol added &quot;International&quot; to its name and was operating six &quot;straight&quot; DC-8 jets and three &quot;stretched&quot; Super DC-8 versions along with their fleet of piston engine propeller aircraft. In 1971 Capitol International Airways moved to Smyrna, Tennessee, at the former Sewart Air Force Base. Capitol remained strong as a military contract air carrier.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s it operated international and domestic scheduled passenger service in addition to charter flights. It was founded by former Army Air Corps pilots, Jesse Stallings, Richmond McGinnis, and Francis Roach, following the end of World War II. Executive Vice President was Frank J. Sparacino. European Director of Operations was Chuck Carr, the Director France Michel Lelièvre and the LBG Airport Manager, P. Landelle. Gatwick Ops was the European Office. In the late 1970s, Capitol Air became a scheduled air carrier following the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. The airline was incorporated in Delaware but headquartered in Smyrna, Tennessee.
Capitol Air maintained a large presence in the eastern United States and Europe. Its hubs were John F. Kennedy International Airport Hangar 11 in New York City, Brussels, Belgium and San Juan, Puerto Rico. From New York/JFK Capitol Air served Los Angeles (LAX), Chicago O&#x27;Hare (ORD), Brussels (BRU), Frankfurt (FRA), Paris, France (LBG) Aguadilla (BQN), San Juan (SJU) and Puerto Plata (POP). From San Juan its served Miami, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston and Santo Domingo. Even though Capitol commenced scheduled passenger operations, charters were still a big part of its operations. Many of the charters operated into San Juan, Puerto Rico, were for Canadian tour operators that required passenger air service in conjunction with cruises that departed San Juan every Saturday.

Capitol Air also operated many charter flights for the United States military. One major trunk route in the mid-1970s connected Rhein-Main Air Base (Frankfurt), Germany to Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina with a refueling stop at Bradley Air National Guard Base (co-located with Bradley International Airport) in Windsor Locks, Connecticut.

Capitol Air declared bankruptcy in the mid-1980s after George Batchelor, now Capitol&#x27;s owner, had largely dismantled the airline in favor of his newly acquired venture, Arrow Air, another formerly all-charter air carrier that eventually initiated scheduled passenger airline operations.

==Destinations==
According to the Capitol Air system timetable dated November 5, 1981, the airline was operating scheduled passenger service to the following domestic and international destinations:

* Boston, Massachusetts (BOS)
* Brussels, Belgium (BRU)
* Chicago, Illinois - O&#x27;Hare International Airport (ORD)
* Frankfurt, Germany (FRA)
* Los Angeles, California (LAX)
* Miami, Florida (MIA)
* Newark, New Jersey - Newark Airport (EWR)
* New York City, New York - John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)
* Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic (POP)
* San Francisco, California (SFO)
* San Juan, Puerto Rico (SJU)
* Zurich, Switzerland (ZRH)

The above referenced timetable also states that all flights were being operated with stretched, Super Douglas DC-8 series 60 and wide body McDonnell Douglas DC-10 jetliners at this time.

Capitol Air&#x27;s hub for scheduled passenger operations at this time was New York JFK Airport with nonstop transatlantic flights being operated from JFK to Brussels, Frankfurt and Zurich in Europe as well as transcontinental nonstops to Los Angeles and San Francisco in addition to nonstops to Chicago, Puerto Plata and San Juan. The airline was also operating nonstop flights from Chicago to Los Angeles, Miami and San Francisco, and from San Juan nonstop to Boston, Miami and Newark at this same time. By 1982, Aguadilla, Puerto Rico (BQN) and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (PHL) had been added to Capitol Air&#x27;s scheduled route system.

==Incidents and accidents==
*2 April 1955 C-46A registration N51424 disappeared flying from Mobile to Warner Robins Air Force Base with wreckage later washing up on beaches and other parts found by diving. The cause was never determined, but weather was poor at the time, including thunderstorms and turbulence. The two crew were presumed dead.
*16 November 1958 C-46F registration N1301N enroute Denver to Hill Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah suffered a right engine failure in IFR conditions. The aircraft crashed and burned at an elevation of 8,700 ft near Fort Collins, Colorado, killing the two pilots on board. See External links for a picture of this aircraft.
*4 October 1960 C-46F registration N4719N was on night-time final approach to McClellan Air Force Base on a flight from Travis Air Force Base, when the crew felt an impact and saw a flash. The Capitol aircraft landed safely and found a dent in a flap. The C-46 had impacted a Cessna, which crashed and exploded, killing the two on board. The Cessna had been engaged in an unauthorized night-time landing.
* 15 October 1960 C-46F registration N1300N in-bound from Rapid City, South Dakota to Hill Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah was making a simulated ILS approach when the right wing separated due to metal fatigue of certain bolts, leading to destruction of the aircraft after crashing at 6,500 ft elevation, and the death of the two crew on board.
*22 January 1961 C-46F registration N1308V suffered an uncontrollable engine fire near Katy, Texas on an Air Force Logair flight from Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas to Mobile, Alabama. The fire was traced to fatigue failure of bolts in an engine. There was evidence fire suppression was attempted unsuccessfully, but the fire burned the engine and wing off the aircraft, destroying the aircraft and killing the two crew. See External links for a picture of this aircraft.
*13 September 1967 C-46F registration N1309V suffered an engine flameout after takeoff from Kingston, Jamaica en route to Fort Lauderdale, resulting in a ditching. Four people on board the aircraft were unharmed, but the aircraft was lost.
*28 April 1968: DC-8-31 registration N1802 crashed at Atlantic City, New Jersey on a training flight. The crew attempted a two-engine approach and touch-and-go and lost control as they applied power. All four crew members survived.
*27 November 1970: Capitol International Airways Flight C2C3/26, a DC-8-63CF registration N4909C, overran the runway while attempting to take off at Anchorage, Alaska en route to Yokota Air Base, Japan. For reasons that could not be determined, all eight main landing gear wheels remained locked during takeoff, preventing reaching sufficient take off speed. 47 of 229 passengers and crew were killed.
*2 October 1977: Shannon Airport, Ireland. DC-8-61 N911CL en-route Rome-Windsor Locks aborted takeoff after a fire. A main landing gear tyre shredded on takeoff, rupturing fuel tanks, causing a fire under the left wing. The tower spotted the fire as did the crew of a sister aircraft that had just arrived. Takeoff was abandoned at V1, the DC-8 stopped just short of the end of the runway. 50 passengers were injured but there were no fatalities. Although significantly damaged, the aircraft was returned to service. Had the aircraft become airborne, the outcome likely would have been far worse.

Additionally, on three occasions between May and August 1983, the airline&#x27;s flight 236 from San Juan, Puerto Rico to Miami was hijacked to Cuba. In all instances, the hijacker was taken into custody uneventfully.

<text>T-type asteroids are rare inner-belt asteroids of unknown composition with dark, featureless and moderately red spectra, and a moderate absorption feature shortwards of 0.85 μm. No direct meteorite analog has been found to date. Thought to be anhydrous, they are considered to be related to P-types or D-types, or possibly a highly altered C-type.

Examples of T-type asteroids include 96 Aegle, 114 Kassandra, 233 Asterope, and 308 Polyxo. The infrared spectrum of the first three are similar to the mineral troilite, while 308 Polyxo is modified with hydration features.

In 2010, the asteroid 596 Scheila was impacted by a projectile. The impact changed its spectrum from T-type to D-type, likely by exposing fresh material that was not weathered.

<text>Newsquest Media Group Limited is the second largest publisher of regional and local newspapers in the United Kingdom. It is owned by the American mass media holding company Gannett. 

It has 205 brands across the UK, publishing online and in print (165 newspaper brands and 40 magazine brands) and reaches 28 million visitors a month online and 6.5 million readers a week in print. 

Based in London, Newsquest employs a total of more than 5,500 people across the UK. It also has a specialist arm that publishes both consumer and business-to-business (B2B) titles such as &quot;Insurance Times&quot; and &quot;The Strad&quot;.

==History==
Newsquest was founded in 1995 when United States private equity partnership KKR financed a £210 million management buy-out of the Reed Regional Newspapers group of British papers from Reed Elsevier.

In 1996 Newsquest swapped its Yorkshire titles for Johnston Press&#x27;s Bury, Greater Manchester area titles and £9.25 million, sold some of its titles in the English Midlands to Midland Independent Newspapers and bought the Westminster Press local newspapers group for £305 million from Pearson, owner of Penguin Books and the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, resulting in Newsquest doubling in size. The next year it floated on the London Stock Exchange, realising a market capitalisation of £500 million. In 1998, Newsquest added the Sussex based &quot;Contact-a-Car&quot;, the &quot;London Property Weekly&quot; titles, two titles in North West England, and three &quot;Review&quot; Group titles in Hertfordshire.
In 1999, Gannett&#x27;s newly formed UK subsidiary paid £922 million (about US $1.5 billion) for Newsquest and took on the company&#x27;s debt. In 2000, Gannett paid £525 million for Southampton-based News Communications and Media&#x27;s South Coast dailies and weeklies – and its Southernprint magazine printing division – to add to Newsquest&#x27;s portfolio. It also picked up the regional newspapers business – outside Manchester – of the Guardian Media Group, a takeover that the Competition Commission cleared as there was &quot;no overlap, in the companies&#x27; circulation areas&quot;.

In 2001, Newsquest bought Surrey and Sussex Publishing and Horley Publishing, publishers of &quot;Gatwick Life&quot; and &quot;Horley Life&quot; and the Dimbleby Newspaper Group&#x27;s nine Greater London weeklies, including the &quot;Richmond &amp; Twickenham Times&quot; for a reported £8 million.

In 2003, Gannett UK paid £216 million for the Scottish Media Group&#x27;s three newspapers – Glasgow&#x27;s &quot;Herald&quot;, &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; and &quot;Evening Times&quot; – 11 specialist consumer and business-to-business magazines and an online advertising and content business. The Competition Commission again inquired into this purchase, but later cleared it. 

In 2005, Newsquest&#x27;s &quot;Exchange Enterprises&quot; division paid £50.25 million for &quot;Exchange &amp; Mart&quot; and &quot;Auto Exchange&quot; from United Advertising Publications after the small ads weeklies&#x27; publisher&#x27;s parent, United Business Media, decided to concentrate on its &#x27;core activities&#x27;. 

Newsquest also owned the formerly-named &quot;Brentford, Chiswick and Isleworth Times&quot;, later known as the &quot;Hounslow and Brentford Times&quot;, which closed in 2010.

On 11 December 2006, Gannett denied having plans to sell Newsquest, contradicting a story in the previous day&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Express&quot; that claimed the media giant was carrying out a company review with the Credit Suisse investment bank, and could sell Newsquest for up to £1.5 billion. Gannett had replied by saying: &quot;There is no truth in the report. Newsquest is a valuable part of the Gannett company.&quot;

On 2 July 2007, in his blog on &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s website, media analyst Roy Greenslade revealed the content of a Newsquest company memo which acknowledged that its staff pension scheme was £65 million in deficit. Members of the company&#x27;s workforce were given the options of increasing their contributions (from 6% to 10%) to keep the same final salary scheme, paying in less for an inferior version, opting for a &#x27;money purchase&#x27; scheme; or ditching their pension altogether.

The company&#x27;s U.S. parent Gannett had on 18 June reported that revenues from its newspapers and broadcasting had fallen – but, the US press release said: &#x27;Newsquest experienced higher national advertising revenue&#x27;. It was &quot;hardly a picture of a company suffering from poor health&quot;, commented Greenslade.

In August 2007 Newsquest started offering users of its Greater London titles&#x27; websites downloadable supermarket coupons which could be redeemed for a range of goods at major supermarket chains, with plans to roll out the scheme to its other publications.

In March 2012, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported the results of an indicative ballot held by the National Union of Journalists among its members at Newsquest, which found that more than 80% were prepared to strike if they were not given a pay rise within the year.

In April 2014, following CEO/Chairman Paul Davidson&#x27;s retirement, Henry Faure Walker was appointed CEO at Newsquest.

In November 2014, publication began of &quot;The National&quot;, a Scottish daily newspaper that supports Scottish independence.

On 26 May 2015, Newsquest announced that it had acquired Romanes Media Group, a local news publishing business operating in Scotland, Berkshire and Northern Ireland, for an undisclosed sum. The Romanes newspaper portfolio comprises one daily, 19 weekly paid-fors and nine weekly frees, and associated websites, and the company employs 270 staff.

On 28 April 2016, Newsquest announced that the latest comScore figures (Feb 2016) showed that users spend more time per month on Newsquest sites than any other regional press group. Newsquest has a digital audience of 28 million unique users including the Scottish jobs website s1jobs.com.

In March 2022, Newsquest acquired the Archant group of regional newspapers from RCapital. 

===July 2007 industrial disputes at Newsquest&#x27;s Scottish titles===
In July 2007, the UK&#x27;s Competition Commission reported that it was investigating allegations made by SNP MP for Perth and North Perthshire Pete Wishart that Newsquest had given it misleading evidence while it was considering whether the Liberal Democrat supporting company should be permitted to take over titles from SMG. Wishart had written to the commission in June 2007 to express his concern about standards and job losses at the newspapers. Union members were holding a ballot over whether they should strike over five redundancies on the &quot;Glasgow Evening News&quot;, one of the papers bought from SMG.

On 20 July 2007, journalists at Newsquest&#x27;s former-SMG titles – &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot;, &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; and &quot;Evening Times&quot; – held a 24-hour strike to protest against compulsory redundancies and cuts of up to £3 million.

Newsquest&#x27;s Glasgow NUJ members went on strike again on 25 July 2007, hampering the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot;&#x27;s planned re-launch. Successful union action had already led to the reinstatement on 31 July of the deputy Father (leader) of the &quot;Evening Times&quot; Chapel (office branch), Gordon Thomson, while a work-to-rule had caused the cancellation of digital training planned for the following week.

&quot;Newsquest&#x27;s purchase of the &quot;Herald&quot; group was backed by assurances that they would maintain standards and not cut editorial budgets,&quot; the NUJ quoted Cathy Peattie Scottish Labour Member of the Scottish Parliament for Falkirk East as saying. &quot;The Competition Commission may have decided that too much time has passed for it to be able to do anything, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that Newsquest gave assurances via the commission to the people of Scotland, and those assurances now look worthless,&quot; she added. She was not surprised staff had walked out.

&quot;They have a long list of causes for dissatisfaction – redundancies, staffing shortages, poor working conditions and high stress levels. This is damaging the health of the workers and the health of the paper. Rather than discuss the problems, Newsquest has derecognised the NUJ,&quot; Peattie continued.

Peattie had tabled a motion in the Scottish Parliament expressing concerns about the &quot;Herald&quot; newspapers. It said Newsquest&#x27;s programme of job cuts would harm the papers&#x27; content and put their staffs at risk and added: &#x27;The Parliament notes that these developments are taking place despite increased profits and assurances given by Newsquest to the Competition Commission, and believes that this is to the detriment of the long term future of the titles and the Scottish newspaper industry.&#x27;

===New parent company===
In 2019 it was reported that New Media Investment Group Inc., the parent company of GateHouse Media, was buying Gannett, the owners of Newsquest.

<doc id="532291" wikidata="Q799007" url="?curid=532291" title="Badgers (animation)">
<text>&quot;Badgers&quot;, also known informally as &quot;Badger Badger Badger&quot; or &quot;The Badger Song&quot;, is an animated meme by British animator Jonti Picking, also known as Mr Weebl. It consists of twelve animated cartoon badgers doing callisthenics, a mushroom in front of a tree, and a snake in the desert. The cartoon is accompanied by a bass line, above which a voiceover sings the names of what is shown on screen.

The cartoon went live on B3ta.com on 2 September 2003 at 3:49 a.m. GMT. The cartoon loops indefinitely.

According to Mr Weebl, the inspiration behind &quot;The Badger Song&quot; comes from the song &quot;Saturday Night&quot; by Whigfield: &quot;[Saturday Night] has a duck quacking throughout. I decided that the tune needed an annoying squeak sound in the background. The lyrics were meant to be a placeholder, but much like The Riddle by Nik Kershaw, the placeholder became the actual thing.&quot;

==Critical reception==
The cartoon brought Picking to the attention of MTV Europe, for whom Picking produced &quot;Weebl and Bob&quot;. That cartoon series, together with the dancing badgers, helped Picking&#x27;s website, Weebl&#x27;s Stuff, win a People&#x27;s Choice award from users of Yahoo! in the UK. &quot;Badger Badger Badger&quot; was also listed as one of the top five internet fads of all time by &quot;PC World&quot; in 2009.

==Follow-up versions==
There have been several follow-ups to the &quot;Badger Badger Badger&quot; cartoon posted to the Weebl&#x27;s Stuff website. &quot;Badgers 2&quot; was created in 2003 and features zombie badgers on a black background with a scratching sound added to the music. A Christmas-themed version, with the badgers dressed in Santa Claus suits, the mushroom replaced with a present, and the snake replaced with baby Jesus in a nativity scene, is also available and was made for the 2004 Weebl Advent Calendar. &quot;Badgers on a Plane&quot; consists of a scene from a &quot;Snakes on a Plane&quot; trailer that includes badgers and a mushroom, which have been digitally edited into the scene, tumbling from their seats while a bit of the song plays in the background. In 2007, &quot;Big Ass Badgers&quot; was released to spoof the &quot;Transformers&quot; film. Also in 2007, a live-action version of the cartoon called &quot;Baby Badgers&quot; was released to promote the new Badger toys.

A &quot;Euro 2004 Edition&quot; was also created during the UEFA Euro 2004 football championship, where the badgers wore England football jerseys to &quot;footy footy footy&quot; and &quot;England! England! Goal! A goal! Oh, it&#x27;s a goal, scored by England, England...&quot; A new version titled &quot;Footy 2010&quot; was created for the 2010 FIFA World Cup with vuvuzelas drowning out the audio. Another version, titled &quot;Realistic Football Badgers&quot;, was created in response to England&#x27;s 2014 FIFA World Cup loss.

The song is referenced in the January 2004 comic strips of JD Fraser&#x27;s User Friendly. A few of the characters interpreted &quot;the song goes on about badgers, mushrooms and a snake&quot; and that the song does not make sense.

A parody by a group called Fifth District, titled &quot;Potter Potter Potter&quot;, depicts several images of Harry Potter dancing on the Hogwarts Campus, one image of Ron Weasley dancing in another area of the campus, and Severus Snape advancing menacingly toward the figures of the bespectacled wizarding teen, with a Whomping Willow tree and flying hippogriffs in the background. The chant is &quot;Potter Potter Potter Potter&quot;, &quot;Weasley! Weasley!&quot;, and &quot;Snape! Snape! Oh, it&#x27;s a Snape!&quot;.

In 2011, a dubstep version called &quot;Guess I Got My Badger Back&quot; was released based on &quot;Swagga&quot; by Excision &amp; Datsik. On 6 April 2011, he uploaded a 3D version.

A new version of the song was launched on the Moshi Monsters website, where the Monsters appear on the screen as &quot;Moshi Moshi&quot; is sung instead. Occasionally, there is a break where &quot;Monster&quot;, or even rarer, &quot;Moshling&quot;, is said instead.

On 6 March 2013, Canadian musician Devin Townsend released a previously unreleased cover of the song while recording the album &quot;Deconstruction&quot;.

Another adaptation of the song, &quot;Save the Badger Badger Badger&quot;, was released on 19 May 2013, in response to proposed badger culling in the United Kingdom. The song features vocals and guitar from Brian May and visuals reminiscent of the 1980 film &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, in addition to vocals from Weebl and Brian Blessed. Some of the song&#x27;s lyrics are changed.

On 2 September 2023, Weebl&#x27;s Stuff uploaded &quot;20 Years of Badgers&quot; in honour of the original video&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

<text>The Swamp Terrorists were a Swiss electro-industrial music group that was formed in 1988 by STR, Ane H, and Francis H. Their music is harsh pounding electro-industrial/industrial hip hop beats, turntables and occasional rapping mixed with grinding metal guitar riffs (which are usually sampled from other heavy metal bands), and produces a sound similar to Die Warzau, KMFDM and White Zombie.

==History==
&#x27;Swamp Terrorists&#x27; were a Swiss electro-industrial music group that was started in the late 1980s by synthesizer programmer STR, (of Band Berne Crematoire, Nacht-Raum, and Strangler of the Swamp fame), vocalist Ane Hebeisen (aka Ane H), (formerly of Tierstein) and guitarist Francis H. Francis H departed from the group after the release of their first EP &quot;He is Guilty&quot;, after which Ane and STR recorded their first album &quot;Grim – Stroke – Disease&quot; together and released it on the Machinery/Noise label in 1991. About a year later, it was followed by &quot;Grow – Speed – Injection&quot;.

Shortly after the 1994 album &quot;Combat Shock&quot;, Swamp Terrorists added several members for their live show: bassist Anrej A, guitarist Spring and drummer Piet Hertig. The band had a dedicated following in Brazil, where they have toured and where their international fan club was based.

STR left the band immediately following the 1995 release &quot;Killer&quot;, and began to work with the guitar-heavy Hellsau. The other four members of the band, as well as STR&#x27;s live replacement ND, have since released a live album, &quot;Five in Japan&quot; and 2 EPs: &quot;Wreck&quot; in 1997, and &quot;Rare &amp; Unreleased&quot; in 1999, on Metropolis Records. The band has been inactive since.

<doc id="532301" wikidata="Q2449442" url="?curid=532301" title="R-type asteroid">
<text>R-type asteroids are moderately bright, relatively uncommon inner-belt asteroids that are spectrally intermediate between the V and A-type asteroids. The spectrum shows distinct olivine and pyroxene features at 1 and 2 micrometres, with a possibility of plagioclase. Shortwards of 0.7 μm the spectrum is very reddish.

The IRAS mission has classified 4 Vesta, 246 Asporina, 349 Dembowska, 571 Dulcinea and 937 Bethgea as type R; however, the re-classification of Vesta, the V archetype, is debatable. Of these bodies, only 349 Dembowska is recognized as being type R when all wavelengths are taken into account.

==List==
As of February 2019, at least 5 asteroids have been classified as R-type:

<doc id="532303" wikidata="Q2495748" url="?curid=532303" title="Topcoder">
<text>Topcoder (formerly TopCoder) is a crowdsourcing company with an open global community of designers, developers, data scientists, and competitive programmers. Topcoder pays community members for their work on the projects and sells community services to corporate, mid-size, and small-business clients. Topcoder also organizes the annual Topcoder Open tournament and a series of smaller regional events.

==History==
Topcoder was founded in 2001 by Jack Hughes, chairman and Founder of the Tallan company. The name was formerly spelt as &quot;TopCoder&quot; until 2013. Topcoder ran regular competitive programming challenges, known as Single Round Matches or &quot;SRMs,&quot; where each SRM was a timed 1.5-hour algorithm competition and contestants would compete against each other to solve the same set of problems. The contestants were students from different secondary schools or universities. Cash prizes ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 per match were secured from corporate sponsors and awarded to tournament winners to generate interest from the student community.

As the community of designers, developers, data scientists, and competitive programmers involved in Topcoder grew, the company started to offer software development services to 3rd party clients, contracting individual community members to work on specific tasks. Most of the revenue, though, still came from consulting services provided to clients by Topcoder employees. From 2006 onwards, Topcoder held design competitions, thus offering design services to their clients. In 2006 Topcoder also started to organize Marathon Matches (MM) – one week long algorithmic contests.

In an attempt to optimize expenses, Topcoder introduced new competition tracks in 2007-2008 and delegated more work from its employees to the community. By 2009, the size of Topcoder&#x27;s staff had been reduced to 16 project managers servicing 35 clients, while the community did most of the actual work via crowdsourcing. Topcoder representatives claim that at this point their community had about 170k registered members, and the company&#x27;s annual revenue was approximately $19 million.

In 2013, Topcoder was acquired by Appirio, and the Topcoder community (of around 500 thousand at the time), was merged, under the Topcoder brand, with the 75k member crowdsourcing community Cloudspokes, created and managed by Appirio.

In 2016, Topcoder, along with Appirio, was acquired by Wipro as a part of a $500 million deal and continued to operate as a separate company under its brand.

Since the end of 2017, Topcoder has continued to offer its enterprise clients the Hybrid Crowd platform, as a way to protect intellectual property in crowdsourcing projects. In addition to the public Topcoder community, the Hybrid Crowd platform allows for the creation of certified and private crowdsourcing communities. Its certified communities include members of public Topcoder communities who are vetted for a customer&#x27;s specific requirements, such as signing an additional NDA, completing a background check, or meeting any other particular certifications. The private communities may include an enterprise&#x27;s employees and contractors. As the first user of Hybrid Crowd, Wipro integrated its internal (employee-only) crowdsourcing platform TopGear with Topcoder.

== Topcoder community ==

Topcoder community is the primary source of the workforce behind all Topcoder projects. It is open and global: anybody, with a few legal restrictions dictated by US laws, and listed in Community Terms, can join and compete, without any financial commitment to Topcoder. Also, participation in challenges organized in the interests of commercial clients generally requires the community member to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Intellectual property for the winning submissions to commercial challenges is passed to the client, in exchange for monetary prizes paid to the winners.

While the majority of community members participate in Topcoder challenges as regular competitors, those who become recognized for their performance, and involvement in community life (via communication in Topcoder forums, attending Topcoder events, etc.), are offered additional roles in the community, which include: copilots (technical coordinators of challenges), problem writers, reviewers, etc. Since the end of 2014 till the end of 2017, a Community Advisory Board (CAB) was selected from active community members for a one-year term to help improve communications between Topcoder company and its community. In 2018 the CAB was replaced by the Topcoder MVP (Most Valuable Player) program.

There are four primary segments of each Topcoder community, open to every member: Design, Development, Data Science, and Competitive Programming. Also, since the end of 2017, Topcoder, as a part of their Hybrid Crowd offering, creates sub-communities dedicated to specific clients/projects. The sub-communities may require members to meet additional eligibility criteria before joining.

=== Design ===
Topcoder design community is focused on:

* Information Architecture
** Wireframes – With customer ideas, application and business requirements as input, competitors are challenged to create a black-and-white interactive user experience guide, able to showcase the logic and user-experience with the further application, without spending time on the exact look and feel.
** Idea Generation – Competitors are asked to develop an idea proposed by the customer, with a written report or visual presentation as deliverables.
* UI/UX/CX Design
**Applications and Web Design – Competitors develop graphical designs for customer application or website; the deliverables are the actual design specifications (graphical images with associated measurements, font details, etc.) for software developers.
** Design Concept – More informal design challenges, where participants should turn client idea into a design, which is not meant to be used for the actual development without further processing.
** Icons design
** Presentation Design – Infographics, print materials, PowerPoint presentations.

Two particular types of Topcoder design challenges are LUX (Live User Experience, 24 – 48 hours long) and RUX (Rapid User Experience, three days long). In both cases, more substantial prizes compared to regular design challenges with the similar goals, are offered in exchange for the shorter timeline. Short timelines allow Topcoder managers to demonstrate to customers how crowdsourcing works on real cases, during live, and few-days meetings with the clients.

=== Development ===
Software development segment of Topcoder community is focused on:

* Bug Bash – Challenges concentrate on fixes of numerous small bugs in an existing software product.
* Code – Generic software development challenges, typically with five day competition phase, and four more days for review, appeals and appeal responses. Usually, two prizes are offered, ~$600 - $1200 for the winner, and half of that for the second place.
* First-to-Finish (F2F) – Rapid software development challenges with no fixed timeline for the competition phase. The first participant who submits a solution satisfying the specifications wins the only prize. In case of defects in a submission, that competitor is provided with review feedback as soon as possible, and allowed to submit again, with no penalty for the failed submission. Typically, such challenges have a small scope, compared to other challenge types.
* Quality Assurance – Challenges focused on testing and search for bugs in the provided software products.
* UI Prototype – Challenges focused on frontend development. Typically, they are reviewed by scorecards paying more attention to the exact match with provided visual design specifications, and include additional phases for final fixes, compared to the regular code challenges.

=== Data science ===
There are several types of data science challenges at Topcoder; typically, they are longer than software development challenges and focused on data science and algorithms, rather than on end-user software products:

* Marathon Match (MM) – A week-long algorithmic contest, in which submissions are judged objectively by an automated scoring function that feeds a live leaderboard, and multiple submission from the same competitor is encouraged during the match with no penalty. Programming languages allowed in MMs are C++, Java, Python, C#.NET, VB.NET. Topcoder has organized Marathon Matches since 2006, and 100th MM was held in April 2018. There are few similar types of challenges (Banner Match, Mini-Marathon Match), different by length and allowed programming languages.
* Data Science First to Finish – Algorithmic contests scored by an automated scoring function, where the first competitor that reaches the specified score thresholds wins.
* Data Science Sprint – A series of rapid data-science challenges, scored by a manual scoring function, and with no leaderboard.
* Data Visualization – Subjectively-judged competition that asks to analyze data and propose the best way to visualize them, along with trends and/or peculiarities in data that should be highlighted. The output of such challenges serves as input into design competition that outputs the actual visualizations of the data.
* Data Science Ideation – A challenge to discover new data/approaches/ideas for a problem with the help of a community.

=== Competitive programming ===
The Competitive Programming track of Topcoder community rotates around Single Round Matches (SRMs) – timed 1.5-hour competitions in which all participants compete online trying to solve the same set of problems as fast as possible. These were the first type of challenges at Topcoder.

=== Specialized sub-communities ===
The following table includes the list of Topcoder sub-communities dedicated to specific technologies and/or clients (within their Hybrid Crowd offering). See section for further information on these sub-communities.
== Topcoder Open ==
Topcoder Open (TCO) is an annual design, software development, data science and competitive programming championship, organized by Topcoder, and hosted in different venues around the US. Each year, the most successful participants of each competition track included into TCO are selected and invited for a free one-week trip to on-site finals, where they compete for prizes, and also socialize with each other, helping to build community spirit among the most active members. In the first two years, 2001 and 2002, the tournament was titled TopCoder Invitational.

In addition to the main championship, from 2001 to 2007 Topcoder organized an annual TopCoder Collegiate Challenge tournament, for college students only. Also from 2007 to 2010, a TopCoder High School competition was held.

Since 2015, Topcoder Regional events have been held through the year in different countries.

== Notable clients and projects ==

=== ConsenSys ===
In 2017, Topcoder entered into a partnership with ConsenSys, an incubator of Ethereum projects, to promote the Topcoder Blockchain Community, and provide ConsenSys with design and development support for their blockchain projects.

=== Eli Lilly and Company ===
It was reported in 2008 that Eli Lilly and Co. would use Topcoder platform to crowdsource development of IT applications for its global drug discovery operations.

=== Harvard Medical School ===
In 2013, it was reported that researchers from Harvard Medical School, Harvard Business School, and London Business School successfully used Topcoder Community to solve complex biological problems. Researchers say that Topcoder competitors approached the biology-related big-data challenge, and managed to create a more accurate and 1000 times faster alternative of BLAST algorithm.

=== IARPA ===
Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity organization collaborates with Topcoder to create innovative algorithms for intelligence applications. From July 2017 to February 2018 it ran the Functional Map of the World challenge to develop deep learning algorithms capable of scanning and identifying in satellite imagery different classes of objects, such as airports, schools, oil wells, shipyards, or ports . In the ongoing Mercury challenge it aims to create AI methods for automated prediction of critical events, involving military action, non-violent civil unrest, and infectious diseases in Middle East.

=== IBM ===
Since 2016 IBM has been collaborating with Topcoder to promote their cloud platform, IBM Cloud, and IBM Watson services, in particular. Within this partnership, Topcoder has created a dedicated Cognitive sub-community and run numerous educational and customer-oriented challenges.

=== NASA ===
In 2010, NASA asked the Topcoder community to optimize the contents of medical kits for future human space exploration missions.

In 2013, NASA Tournament Lab cooperated with Topcoder to run data-science challenges targeting to improve computer vision algorithms for their Robonaut 2 humanoid robot; in another challenge, Topcoder members were asked to develop algorithms for optimization of ISS solar arrays usage. Also in 2013 Topcoder helped NASA to develop a software solution for tracking food consumption by astronauts.

In another challenge, Topcoder community helped NASA and National Geographic&#x27;s explorer Albert Lin to develop an algorithm to identify human-built structures in Genghis Khan&#x27;s homeland.

In 2014, Asteroid Data Hunter, Asteroid Tracker, and many other challenges were carried on to develop better algorithms for asteroids detection in space images.

In 2015, the Topcoder Data Science community was challenged by NASA, Quakefinder, Harvard Crowd Innovation Lab, and Amazon Web Services, to come up with an algorithm that finds correlations between ultra-low frequency electromagnetic signals emanating from the earth, and subsequent moderate and large earthquakes.

In 2017, NASA, HeroX, and Topcoder announced a challenge to optimize their computational-intensive software solution for fluid dynamics, FUN3D, which was cancelled later due to a high number of applicants (more than 1,800) during the registration, coupled with concerns about control over the public distribution of the software to optimize.

In 2018, a data science challenge is running currently to develop better algorithms for tracking of RFID-tagged items within the International Space Station.

=== Topcoder Veterans Community ===
At the end of 2017 Topcoder, together with Operation Code non-profit charity, announced the launch of Topcoder Veterans Community, that will focus on helping US military veterans to make their way into tech careers in software development via education programs and paid crowdsourcing challenges.

<doc id="532309" wikidata="Q2449449" url="?curid=532309" title="Q-type asteroid">
<text>Q-type asteroids are relatively uncommon inner-belt asteroids with a strong, broad 1 micrometre olivine and pyroxene feature, and a spectral slope that indicates the presence of metal. There are absorption features shortwards and longwards of 0.7 μm, and the spectrum is generally intermediate between the V and S-type.

Q-type asteroids are spectrally more similar to ordinary chondrite meteorites (types H, L, LL) than any other asteroid type. This has led scientists to speculate that they are abundant, but only about 20 of this type has been characterized. Examples of Q-type asteroids are: 1862 Apollo, 2102 Tantalus, 3753 Cruithne, 6489 Golevka, and 9969 Braille.

<doc id="532316" wikidata="Q1955484" url="?curid=532316" title="Musselshell River">
<text>The Musselshell River is a tributary of the Missouri River, long from its origins at the confluence of its North and South Forks near Martinsdale, Montana to its mouth on the Missouri River. It is located east of the Continental divide entirely within Montana in the United States. Counting its pre-confluence tributaries, it measures in length.

It rises in several forks in the Crazy, Little Belt, and Castle mountains in central Montana. The main branch is formed by the confluence of the North Fork and South Fork in Meagher County, about east of White Sulphur Springs, Montana, just east of Martinsdale, north of Martinsdale Reservoir, and just west of Meagher County&#x27;s border with Wheatland County. The North Fork flows south from the Little Belt Mountains through Bair Reservoir, then southeast. The South Fork flows northeast from the Crazy Mountains. From the confluence of these two waterways, the main branch flows roughly due east past Two Dot, Harlowton, and Roundup, then turns north just past Melstone, and continues to the UL Bend on the Missouri River at the beginning of Fort Peck Reservoir.

The Musselshell River has also been known as: Cockkleshell River, Mahtush-ahzhah, Muscleshell River, Mustleshell River, Shell River. The Musselshell was entered by the Lewis and Clark Expedition on May 20, 1805 and named by them for the freshwater mussels lining the bank, noting in their journals that the Minnetare people had given the waterway a similar name. The Blackfeet, who hunted buffalo and prepared the meat for winter in the Musselshell area, called it the Dried Meat River.

==Geography==

The terrain varies from the mountainous island ranges where it originates to prairie. It is fed largely by snowmelt and has its highest flow rates in the spring and early summer. The Musselshell River Basin, including tributaries, drains . The South Fork has much brush, gravel bars, and clear water. The North Fork has willow trees and undercut banks. The Musselshell is about wide at its confluence of the two forks. Three reservoirs built in the 1930s help control the river&#x27;s flow: Bair Reservoir on the North Fork, Martinsdale Reservoir near the confluence, and Deadman&#x27;s Basin on the main river between Shawmut and Ryegate. The river becomes wider in the before Roundup. Honeysuckle, wild rose, willow, and cottonwood are common in this section. The river is about wide in its last , with increased choppiness and flow rate. The relatively more arid climate in this section results in less vegetation, more livestock grazing, and poorer soil. Additional tributaries of the Musselshell include: Middle Fork, Bozeman Fork, Dry Fork, American Creek Fork, Big Elk Creek, Careless Creek, Cottonwood Creek, Flat Willow Creek, Hopley Creek, Spring Creek, Swimming Woman Creek, and Willow Creek.

==Usage==

Recreational use of the Musselshell averages 63,000 visitor-days per year. Much of the water on the Musselshell is decreed water and managed by the Musselshell River Distribution Project. The Musselshell is used extensively for irrigation for farming and ranching and due to that may run dry or nearly dry in many sections during much of the summer and fall. Water supply is less in the lower basin due to the more arid climate and the fact that users in the upper basin have senior rights to the water. Fishing is popular along most parts of the Musselshell. Species of fish found on the North and/or South Forks down to Harlowton include: mountain whitefish, and brown, cutthroat, rainbow, and brook trout. The eastern part of the river has channel catfish, sauger, smallmouth bass, and walleye due to the warmer water caused by dewatering from irrigation and the arid climate shift from mountain to prairie ecosystems in the Musselshell&#x27;s last . There are three different species of freshwater mussels as well as crawdads.

The Gordon Butte Pumped Storage Project is a planned pumped hydroelectric power plant that will use water from the Cottonwood Creek, a Musselshell tributary.

==Spring 2011 flood==

There was major flooding on the Musselshell River in May 2011. On May 26 the flooding inundated portions of Roundup. Cresting and flow rate records were set along several sections of the river, such as Mosby and Shawmut, near Harlowton. The crest of the flood at , more than over flood state, exceeded the record previously set in 1975.

==Legacy==
The Musselshell region is where the last surviving herds of wild American buffalo lived. Zoologist William Temple Hornaday of the Smithsonian Institution harvested specimens from the region in 1886 so that future generations would know what the buffalo looked like. The Musselshell was mentioned by both Del Gue and Jeremiah Johnson in the film &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot;. The Musselshell is also mentioned in Larry McMurtry&#x27;s classic 1985 novel &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;. Roundup is home to the Musselshell Valley Historical Museum, which documents the region&#x27;s history.

<text>P-type (primitive-type) asteroids have low albedo and a featureless reddish spectrum. It has been suggested that they have a composition of organic-rich silicates, carbon and anhydrous silicates, possibly with water ice in their interior. P-type asteroids are found in the outer asteroid belt and beyond. There are about 33 known P-type asteroids, depending on the classification, including 46 Hestia, 65 Cybele, 76 Freia, 87 Sylvia, 153 Hilda, 476 Hedwig and, in some classifications, 107 Camilla.

==Taxonomy==
An early system of asteroid taxonomy was established in 1975 from the doctoral thesis work of David J. Tholen. This was based upon observations of a group of 110 asteroids. The U-type classification was used as a miscellaneous class for asteroids with unusual spectra that did not fit into the C and S-type asteroid classifications. In 1976, some of these U-type asteroids with unusual moderate albedo levels were labeled as M-type.

Around 1981, an offshoot of the M-type asteroid branch appeared for minor planets that have spectra that are indistinguishable from M-type, but that also have low albedo not consistent with the M type. These were initially labeled X-type asteroids, then type DM (dark M) or PM (pseudo-M), before acquiring their own unique classification as P-type asteroids (where the P indicates &quot;pseudo-M&quot;).

==Properties==
The P-type asteroids are some of the darkest objects in the Solar System with very low albedos (pv&lt;0.1) and appear to be organic-rich, similar to carbonaceous chondrites. Their colors are somewhat redder than S-type asteroids and they do not show spectral features. The red coloration may be caused by organic compounds related to kerogen. The reflectance spectra of P-type asteroids can be reproduced through a combination of 31% CI and 49% CM groups of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, plus 20% Tagish lake meteorites, after undergoing thermal metamorphism and space weathering.

The density of the only two well-characterized P-type asteroids, 87 Sylvia and 107 Camilla P-type asteroids appears to be low, at – lower even than C-type asteroids. It is not clear what this tells us about their compositions. Both Sylvia and Camilla have moons and indications that they have been be disrupted, but they are also quite massive, at over kg, and so are unlikely to have much internal porosity affecting their densities.

The outer part of the main asteroid belt beyond 2.6 AU from the Sun is dominated by low-albedo C, D and P-type asteroids. These are primitive asteroids that may have had their materials chemically altered by liquid water. There are 33 known P-type asteroids. In addition to this, P-type asteroids are thought to be found in the outer asteroid belt and beyond. The distribution of P-type asteroids peaks at an orbital distance of 4 AU.

D-type asteroids are found in the outer asteroid belt and beyond; examples are 152 Atala, 944 Hidalgo and most Jupiter trojans. It has been suggested that the Tagish Lake meteorite was a fragment from a D-type asteroid, and that the Martian moon Phobos is closely related.

The Nice model suggests that D-type asteroids may have originated in the Kuiper belt. 46 D-type asteroids are known, including: 3552 Don Quixote, 944 Hidalgo, 624 Hektor, and 10199 Chariklo.

<text>G-type asteroids are a relatively uncommon type of carbonaceous asteroid that makes up approximately 5% of asteroids. The most notable asteroid in this class is 1 Ceres.

==Characteristics==
Generally similar to the C-type objects, but contain a strong ultraviolet absorption feature below 0.5 μm. An absorption feature around 0.7 μm may also be present, which is indicative of phyllosilicate minerals such as clays or mica. 

In the SMASS classification
the G-type corresponds to the Cgh and Cg types, depending on the presence or absence (respectively) of the absorption feature at 0.7 μm. The G-type, C-type and some rare types are sometimes collected together into a wider C-group of carbonaceous asteroids.

<text>B-type asteroids are a relatively uncommon type of carbonaceous asteroid, falling into the wider C-group; the &#x27;B&#x27; indicates these objects are spectrally blue. In the asteroid population, B-class objects can be found in the outer asteroid belt, and also dominate the high-inclination Pallas family which includes the third-largest asteroid 2 Pallas. They are thought to be primitive, volatile-rich remnants from the early Solar System. There are 65 known B-type asteroids in the SMASS classification, and 9 in the Tholen classification as of March 2015.

==Characteristics==
Generally similar to the C-type objects, but differing in that the ultraviolet absorption below 0.5 μm is small or absent, and the spectrum is rather slightly bluish than reddish. The albedo also tends to be greater than in the generally very dark C type. Spectroscopy of B-class objects suggests major surface constituents of anhydrous silicates, hydrated clay minerals, organic polymers, magnetite, and sulfides. The closest matches to B-class asteroids have been obtained on carbonaceous chondrite meteorites that have been gently heated in the laboratory.

The majority of asteroids that have been observed to display cometary-like activity are B-types. Some of these objects display indications of aqueous alteration in the past, and they may have incorporated significant amounts of water ice.

Asteroid 101955 Bennu is a B-type asteroid which is the target of the OSIRIS-REx mission. The mission seeks to characterize the asteroid by mapping the surface, studying the Yarkovsky effect, and retrieving a sample of the asteroid to return in 2023. The spacecraft was launched in 2016 and has been at Bennu since December 2018.

Other B-type asteroids include:

<text>F-type asteroids are a relatively uncommon type of carbonaceous asteroid, falling into the wider C-group.

==Characteristics==
F-type asteroids have spectra generally similar to those of the B-type asteroids, but
lack the &quot;water&quot; absorption feature around 3 μm indicative of hydrated minerals, and differ in the low wavelength part of the ultraviolet spectrum below 0.4 μm.

The F-type and B-type asteroids are not distinguishable with the criteria used in the SMASS classification, so in that scheme are grouped together under the B-type.

<text>The Kingston Trio is an American folk and pop music group that helped launch the folk revival of the late 1950s to the late 1960s. The group started as a San Francisco Bay Area nightclub act with an original lineup of Dave Guard, Bob Shane, and Nick Reynolds. It rose to international popularity fueled by unprecedented sales of LP records and helped alter the direction of popular music in the U.S.

The Kingston Trio was one of the most prominent groups of the era&#x27;s folk-pop boom, which they kick-started in 1958 with the release of the Trio&#x27;s eponymous first album and its hit recording of &quot;Tom Dooley&quot;, which became a number one hit and sold over three million copies as a single. The Trio released nineteen albums that made &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 100, fourteen of which ranked in the top 10, and five of which hit the number 1 spot. Four of the group&#x27;s LPs charted among the 10 top-selling albums for five weeks in November and December 1959, a record unmatched for more than 50 years, and the group still ranks in the all-time lists of many of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s cumulative charts, including those for most weeks with a number 1 album, most total weeks charting an album, most number 1 albums, most consecutive number 1 albums, and most top ten albums.

In 1961, the Trio was described as &quot;the most envied, the most imitated, and the most successful singing group, folk or otherwise, in all show business&quot; and &quot;the undisputed kings of the folk-singing rage by every yardstick&quot;. The Trio&#x27;s massive record sales in its early days made acoustic folk music commercially viable, paving the way for singer-songwriter, folk rock, and Americana artists who followed in their wake.

The Kingston Trio continues to tour as of 2025 with musicians who licensed the name and trademark in 2017.

==Formation, 1954–1957==
Dave Guard and Bob Shane had been friends since junior high school at the Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawaii, where both had learned to play ukulele in required music classes. They had developed an interest in and admiration for native Hawaiian slack key guitarists like Gabby Pahinui. While in Punahou&#x27;s secondary school, Shane taught first himself and then Guard the rudiments of the six-string guitar, and the two began performing at parties and in school shows doing an eclectic mix of Tahitian, Hawaiian, and calypso songs.

After graduating from high school in 1952, Guard enrolled at Stanford University while Shane matriculated at nearby Menlo College. At Menlo, Shane became friends with Nick Reynolds, a native San Diegan with an extensive knowledge of folk and calypso songs—in part from his guitar-playing father, a career officer in the U.S. Navy. Reynolds was also able to create and sing tenor harmonies, a skill derived in part from family singalongs, and could play both guitar and bongo and conga drums. Shane and Reynolds performed at fraternity parties and luaus for a time, and eventually Shane introduced Reynolds to Guard. The three began performing at campus and neighborhood hangouts, sometimes as a trio but with an aggregation of friends that could swell its ranks to as many as six or seven, according to Reynolds. They usually billed themselves under the name of &quot;Dave Guard and the Calypsonians&quot;. None of the three at that time had any serious aspirations to enter professional show business, however, and Shane returned to Hawaii following his graduation in late 1956 to work in the family sporting goods business.

Still in the Bay Area, Guard and Reynolds had organized themselves somewhat more formally into an entity named &quot;The Kingston Quartet&quot; with friends bassist Joe Gannon and vocalist Barbara Bogue, though as before the members were often joined in their performances by other friends. At one engagement at Redwood City&#x27;s Cracked Pot beer garden, they met a young San Francisco publicist named Frank Werber, who had heard of them from a local entertainment reporter. Werber liked the group&#x27;s raw energy but did not consider them refined enough to want to represent them as an agent or manager at that point, though he left his telephone number with Guard.

Some weeks later (and following a brief period in which Reynolds was temporarily replaced in the quartet by Don MacArthur), Guard and Reynolds invited Werber to a performance of the group at the Italian Village Restaurant in San Francisco, where Werber was so impressed by the group&#x27;s progress that he agreed to manage them provided they replace Gannon, in whose professional potential Werber had no faith. Bogue left with Gannon, and Guard, Reynolds, and Werber invited Shane to rejoin the now more formally organized band. Shane, who had been performing part-time as a solo act at night in Honolulu, readily assented and returned to the mainland in early March 1957.

The four drew up a contract as equal partners in Werber&#x27;s office in San Francisco, deciding on the name &quot;Kingston Trio&quot; because it evoked, through its association with Kingston, Jamaica, the calypso music popular at the time, and also on the uniform of three-quarter-length sleeved vertically striped shirts that the group hoped would help its target audience of college students to identify with them.

==Era of peak success, 1957–61==
Werber imposed a stern training regimen on Guard, Shane, and Reynolds, rehearsing them for six to eight hours a day for several months, sending them to prominent San Francisco vocal coach Judy Davis to help them learn to preserve their voices, and working on the group&#x27;s carefully prepared but apparently spontaneous banter between songs. At the same time, the group was developing a varied and eclectic repertoire of calypso, folk, and foreign language songs, suggested by all three of the musicians though usually arranged by Guard with some harmonies created by Reynolds.

The first major break for the Kingston Trio came in late June 1957 when comedian Phyllis Diller canceled a week-long engagement at The Purple Onion club in San Francisco. When Werber persuaded the club&#x27;s owner to give the untested Trio a chance, Guard sent out five hundred postcards to everyone that the three musicians knew in the Bay Area and Werber plastered the city with handbills announcing the engagement. When the crowds came, the Trio had been well prepared by months of work, and they achieved such local popularity that the initial week&#x27;s engagement stretched to six months. Werber built upon this initial success, booking a national club tour in early 1958 for the Trio that included engagements at such prominent night spots as Mister Kelly&#x27;s in Chicago, the Village Vanguard in New York, Storyville in Boston, and finally a return to San Francisco and its showcase nightclub, the hungry i, in June of that year.

At the same time, Werber was attempting to leverage the Trio&#x27;s popularity as a club act into a recording contract. Both Dot Records and Liberty Records expressed some interest, but each proposed to record the Trio on 45 rpm (revolutions per minute) singles only, whereas Werber and the Trio members both felt that rpm albums had more potential for the group&#x27;s music. Through Jimmy Saphier, agent for Bob Hope who had seen and liked the group at The Purple Onion, Werber contacted Capitol Records, which dispatched prominent producer Voyle Gilmore to San Francisco to evaluate the Trio&#x27;s commercial potential. On Gilmore&#x27;s strong recommendation, Capitol signed the Kingston Trio to an exclusive seven-year deal.

The group&#x27;s first album, Capitol T996 &quot;The Kingston Trio&quot;, was recorded over a three-day period in February 1958 and released in June that year, just as the Trio was beginning its engagement at the hungry i. Gilmore had made two important supervisory decisions as producer — first, to add the same kind of &quot;bottom&quot; to the Trio&#x27;s sound that he had heard in live performance and consequently recruiting Purple Onion house bassist Buzz Wheeler to play on the album, and second to record the group&#x27;s songs without the supporting orchestral accompaniment that was nearly universal (even for folk-styled records) at the time. The song selections on the first album reflected the repertoire that the musicians had been working on for two years—re-imagined traditional songs inspired by The Weavers like &quot;Santy Anno&quot; and &quot;Bay of Mexico&quot;, calypso-flavored tunes such as &quot;Banua&quot; and &quot;Sloop John B&quot; that were reminiscent of the popular Harry Belafonte recordings of the time, and a mix of both foreign language and contemporary songwriter numbers, including Terry Gilkyson&#x27;s &quot;Fast Freight&quot; and &quot;Scotch and Soda&quot;, whose authorship remains unknown as of 2023.

The album sold moderately well—including on-site sales at the hungry i during the Kingston Trio&#x27;s engagement there through the summer—but it was DJs Paul Colburn and Bill Terry at station KLUB in Salt Lake City whose enthusiasm for a single cut on the record spurred the next development in the group&#x27;s history. Colburn began playing &quot;Tom Dooley&quot; extensively on his show, prompting a rush of album sales in the Salt Lake area by fans who wanted to listen to the song, as yet unavailable as a single record. Colburn called other DJs around the country urging them to do the same, and national response to the song was so strong that a reluctant Capitol Records finally released the tune as a 45rpm single on August 8, 1958; it reached the number 1 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart by late November, sold a million copies by Christmas, and was awarded a gold record on January 21, 1959. &quot;Tom Dooley&quot; also spurred the debut album to a number 1 position on the charts and helped the band earn a second gold record for the LP, which remained charted on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; weekly reports for 195 weeks.
The success of the album and the single earned the Kingston Trio a Grammy Award for Best Country &amp; Western Performance for &quot;Tom Dooley&quot; at the awards&#x27; inaugural ceremony in 1959. At the time, no folk music category existed. The next year, largely as a result of &quot;The Kingston Trio&quot; and &quot;Tom Dooley&quot;, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences instituted a folk category and the Trio won the first Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording for its second studio album &quot;At Large.&quot;

This was the beginning of a remarkable three-year run for the Trio in which its first five studio albums achieved number 1 chart status and were awarded gold records. By 1961, the group had sold more than eight million records, earning in excess of US$25 million for Capitol, roughly US$ million in dollars. The Kingston Trio was responsible for 15 percent of Capitol&#x27;s total sales when Capitol recorded many other popular artists, including Frank Sinatra and Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole. For five consecutive weeks in November and December 1959, four Kingston Trio albums ranked in the top ten of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top LPs chart, an accomplishment unmatched by any artist before or since. The Trio also charted several single records during this time, made numerous television appearances, and played upwards of 200 engagements per year.

==Change and a second phase, 1961–67==
By early 1961 a rift developed and deepened between Guard on one side and Shane and Reynolds on the other. Guard had been referred to in the press and on the albums&#x27; liner notes as the &quot;acknowledged leader&quot; of the group, a description never wholly endorsed by Shane and Reynolds, who felt themselves equal contributors to the group&#x27;s repertoire and success. Guard wanted Shane and Reynolds to follow his lead and learn more of the technical aspects of music and to redirect the group&#x27;s song selections, in part because of the withering criticism that the group had been getting from more traditional folk performers for the Trio&#x27;s smoother and more commercial versions of folk songs and for the money-making copyrights that the Kingston group had secured for its arrangements of public domain songs. Shane and Reynolds felt that the formula for song selection and performance that they had painstakingly developed still served them well.

Furthermore, over $100,000 appeared to be missing from the Trio&#x27;s publishing royalties, an accounting error eventually rectified, which created an additional irritant to both sides. Guard regarded it as inexcusable carelessness while to Shane and Reynolds it highlighted what they perceived as Guard&#x27;s propensity to claim individual copyright for some of the group&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Tom Dooley&quot; (though Guard eventually lost a suit over copyright for that number to Alan Lomax, Frank Warner, and Frank Proffitt) and &quot;Scotch and Soda&quot;.

Following a meeting with attorneys on May 10, 1961, intended to resolve the dispute, Dave Guard resigned from the Kingston Trio, though pledging to fulfill group commitments through November of that year. Shane, Reynolds, and Werber bought out Guard&#x27;s interest in the partnership for $300,000 to be paid over a number of years and moved to replace him immediately. The remaining Trio partners settled quickly on John Stewart, a 21-year-old member of the Cumberland Three, one of the many groups that sprang up hoping to imitate the Kingston Trio&#x27;s success. Stewart was well-acquainted with Reynolds and Shane, having sold two songs to the Trio, and he was a proficient guitarist, banjoist, and singer. Stewart began rehearsing and recording with the group nearly immediately, commencing public appearances with the Trio in September 1961.

According to Shane, &quot;We did nearly as well with John as we did with Dave.&quot; Six of the group&#x27;s next seven albums between 1961 and 1963 continued to place in &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top Ten and several of the group&#x27;s most successful singles, including &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone?&quot; and &quot;Greenback Dollar&quot;, charted as well.

Beginning in 1964, however, the Kingston Trio&#x27;s dominance in record sales and concert bookings began to wane, due partly to imitators in the pop-folk world and also to the rise of other commercial folk groups like Peter, Paul and Mary whose music had a decidedly more political bent than the Trio&#x27;s. The British Invasion spearheaded by The Beatles, who were signed by EMI/Capitol just as the Trio&#x27;s seven-year contract was running out, depressed sales of acoustic folk albums significantly, and Capitol did not make a serious effort to re-sign the group. According to critic Ken Barnes, the British Invasion played a significant role in curtailing the sales of the Trio&#x27;s recordings, one of the few bands that could legitimately blame the Invasion for their downfall.

Werber secured a generous signing bonus from Decca Records, and the last four albums of the Kingston Trio&#x27;s first decade were released by that label. Without the production facilities of Capitol, however, and the expertise of Voyle Gilmore and engineer Pete Abbott, the Decca releases lacked the aural brilliance of the Capitol albums, and none of the four sold especially well.

By 1966, Reynolds had grown weary of touring and Stewart wanted to strike out on his own as a singer-songwriter, so the three musicians and Werber developed an exit strategy of playing as many dates as possible for a year with an endpoint determined to be a final two-week engagement at the hungry i in June 1967. The group followed this strategy successfully, and on June 17, 1967, the Kingston Trio ceased to be an actively performing band.

==Hiatus and the New Kingston Trio, 1967–1976==
Following the hungry i engagement, Reynolds moved to Port Orford, Oregon and pursued interests in ranching, business, and race cars for the next twenty years. Stewart commenced a long and distinguished career as a singer-songwriter, composing hit songs like &quot;Daydream Believer&quot; for The Monkees and &quot;Runaway Train&quot; for Rosanne Cash. He recorded more than 40 albums of his own, most notably the landmark &quot;California Bloodlines&quot;, and found chart success in the top forty with &quot;Midnight Wind&quot;, &quot;Lost Her in the Sun&quot;, and &quot;Gold&quot;, the latter reaching number 5 in 1979.

Bob Shane decided to stay in entertainment, and he experimented with solo work. He recorded several singles, including a well-received but under-marketed version of the song &quot;Honey&quot; that later became a million-seller for Bobby Goldsboro, and with different configurations with other folk-oriented performers. Though finances were not an immediate concern—the Kingston Trio partners Werber, Shane and Reynolds still owned an office building, a restaurant, other commercial real estate, and a variety of other lucrative investments—Shane wanted to return to a group environment and in 1969 secured permission from his partners to use the mutually owned group name for another band, with Reynolds and Werber insisting only that Shane&#x27;s group be musically as accomplished as its predecessors and that Shane prefix &quot;new&quot; to the band&#x27;s title.

Shane agreed and organized two troupes under the name of &quot;The New Kingston Trio&quot;. The first consisted of guitarist Pat Horine and banjoist Jim Connor in addition to Shane and lasted from 1969 to 1973, the second including guitarist Roger Gambill and banjoist Bill Zorn from 1973 until 1976. Shane tried to create a repertoire for these groups that included both the older and expected Kingston Trio standards like &quot;Tom Dooley&quot; and &quot;M.T.A.&quot; but that would also feature more contemporary songs as well, including country and novelty tunes. The attempt did not meet with any significant success. The only full-length album released by either group was &quot;The World Needs a Melody&quot; in 1973 (though 25 years later FolkEra Records issued &quot;The Lost Masters 1969–1972&quot;, a compilation of previously unreleased tracks from the Shane-Horine-Connor years), and its sales were negligible. Though both troupes of the New Kingston Trio made a limited number of other recordings and several television appearances, neither generated very much interest from fans or the public at large.

==The third phase, 1976–2017==
In 1976, Bill Zorn left the New Kingston Trio to work as a solo performer and record producer in London. Shane and Gambill replaced him with George Grove, a professionally trained singer and instrumentalist from North Carolina who had been working in Nashville as a studio musician.

The same year, Shane secured from Werber and Reynolds the unencumbered rights to use the band&#x27;s original name of the Kingston Trio without the appended &quot;new&quot; in exchange for relinquishing his interest in the still-profitable corporation, whose holdings included copyrights and licensing rights to many of the original Trio&#x27;s songs. Since 1976, the various troupes owned by Shane have performed and recorded simply as the Kingston Trio.

The Shane-Gambill-Grove Kingston Trio existed from 1976 through 1985, when Gambill died unexpectedly from a heart attack on March 2 at the age of 42. The nine years of this configuration was to that point the longest period of time that any three musicians had worked together as the Kingston Trio, and the group released two albums of largely original material.

It was during this period as well that PBS producers JoAnne Young and Paul Surratt approached Shane and the other principals of the original group with the idea of arranging a reunion concert that would be taped and used as a fundraiser for the network. Agreement was reached, and on November 7, 1981, Dave Guard, Nick Reynolds, and John Stewart joined the Shane-Gambill-Grove Trio and guest performers Mary Travers of Peter, Paul and Mary, Tom Smothers of the Smothers Brothers, and Lindsey Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac at the Magic Mountain amusement park north of Los Angeles for a show billed as &quot;The Kingston Trio and Friends Reunion.&quot; The different configurations of the Trio took turns performing sets of the group&#x27;s best-known songs with all the artists joining onstage for a finale.

More than twenty years had passed since Dave Guard had left the group, but residual tension surfaced between Guard and Shane in a preview article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that appeared in March 1982 in advance of the national broadcast of the taped show. Guard implicitly disparaged Shane&#x27;s current group, and Shane asserted a distaste for performing again with Guard, who had spent the intervening decades living and performing in Australia, touring sporadically as a soloist, and writing about and teaching music. Despite the unpleasantness, Shane and Guard reconciled to a large degree (even to the point of planning a possible reunion tour) prior to Guard&#x27;s death at age 56 from lymphoma nine years later in March 1991.

Following the 1985 death of Roger Gambill, Kingston Trio personnel changed several times, though Shane and Grove remained constants. Bob Haworth, a veteran folk performer who had worked as a member of The Brothers Four for many years, initially replaced Gambill from 1985 through 1988 and again from 1999 through 2005. In 1988, original member Nick Reynolds rejoined the band until his final retirement in 1999. When heart disease forced Bob Shane&#x27;s retirement from touring in March 2004, he was replaced by former New Kingston Trio member Bill Zorn. A year later, following Haworth&#x27;s departure, Grove and Zorn were joined by Rick Dougherty, who had performed for a time with Zorn as second-generation members of another popular folk group from the 1960s, The Limeliters.

Both the Grove–Zorn–Haworth and Grove–Zorn–Dougherty troupes of the Kingston Trio released original CDs and DVDs, and the latter configuration toured extensively for 12 years under the direction of original member Bob Shane. Capitol Records, Decca Records, Collector&#x27;s Choice Music, and Folk Era Records have released and continue to release compilations of older albums as well as previously unreleased tapes of both studio and live recordings from the Kingston Trio&#x27;s first ten years.

==Trademark and roster changes, 2017 to the present==
In October 2017, Grove, Zorn, and Dougherty were replaced as the Trio by new licensees Josh Reynolds (son of original Kingston Trio founder Nick Reynolds), Mike Marvin, a close childhood friend of the Reynolds family, and Tim Gorelangton. In 2018, Josh Reynolds left the group and was replaced by Bob Haworth, who became a member of the band for the third time. At the end of 2018, Haworth left the group and was replaced by another former Limeliter, Don Marovich. Marovich resigned from the group in early 2022 and was replaced by Americana artist Buddy Woodward.

Bob Shane, the last original member of the trio, died on January 20, 2020. George Grove and Rick Dougherty continue to perform folk music by joining veteran entertainer Jerry Siggins as the Folk Legacy Trio.

==Folk music label==
===Initial criticism===
Almost from its inception, the Kingston Trio found itself at odds with the traditional music community. Urban folk musicians of the time (to whom Bob Dylan referred in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;the left-wing puritans that seemed to have a hold on the folk-music community&quot;) frequently associated folk music with leftist politics and were contemptuous of the Trio&#x27;s deliberate political neutrality. Peter Dreier of Occidental College observed that &quot;Purists often derided the Kingston Trio for watering down folk songs in order to make them commercially popular and for remaining on the political sidelines during the protest movements of the 1960s.&quot; A series of scathing articles appeared over several years in &quot;Sing Out!&quot; magazine, a publication that combined articles on traditional folk music with political activism. Its editor Irwin Silber referred to &quot;the sallow slickness of the Kingston Trio&quot; and in an article in the spring 1959 issue Ron Radosh said that the Trio brought &quot;good folk music to the level of the worst in Tin Pan Alley music&quot; and referred to its members as &quot;prostitutes of the art who gain their status as folk artists because they use guitars and banjos&quot;. Following the Trio&#x27;s performance at the premier Newport Folk Festival in 1959, folk music critic Mark Morris wrote: &quot;What connection these frenetic tinselly showmen have with a folk festival eludes me... except that it is mainly folk songs that they choose to vulgarize.&quot;

Frank Proffitt, the Appalachian musician whose version of &quot;Tom Dooley&quot; the Trio rearranged, watched their performance of his song on a television show and wrote in reaction, &quot;They clowned and hipswung. Then they came out with &#x27;This time tomorrow, reckon where I&#x27;ll be/If it hadn&#x27;t a&#x27; been for Grayson/I&#x27;d a been in Tennessee.&#x27; I began to feel sorty sick. Like I&#x27;d lost a loved one. Tears came to my eyes. I went out and bawled on the ridge.&quot; Proffitt had learned the song from his father and his grandmother, who had known Tom Dula and Laura Foster, the killer and the victim in the actual 1866 murder related in the song. Both Proffitt and fellow North Carolina musician Doc Watson sang the older version of the tune, which had &quot;a lively mocking tempo... that retained some of the ghastliness and moral squalor of an actual murder&quot;, according to folk historian Robert Cantwell, who also notes that the Kingston Trio&#x27;s version of the song omitted several verses from the traditional lyric. The slower, harmonized Trio version of the Dooley song and other traditional numbers struck Proffitt as a betrayal of &quot;the strange mysterious workings which has made Tom Dooly [sic] live...&quot; In 2006, folk traditionalist and influential banjo master Billy Faier remarked: &quot;I hear and see very little respect for the folk genre&quot; in their music and described the Trio&#x27;s repertoire as &quot;a mishmash of twisted arrangements that not only obscure the true beauty of the folk songs from which they derive, but give them a meaning they never had.&quot;

However, Trio members never claimed to be folksingers and were never comfortable with the label. The liner notes for the group&#x27;s first album featured a quotation from Dave Guard asserting that &quot;We don&#x27;t really consider ourselves folksingers in the accepted sense of the word...&quot; Guard later told journalist Richard Hadlock in &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine: &quot;We are not students of folk music; the basic thing for us is honest and worthwhile songs that people can pick up and become involved in.&quot; Nick Reynolds added in the same article: &quot;We don&#x27;t collect old songs in the sense that the academic cats do... We get new tunes to look over every day. Each one of us has his ears open constantly to new material or old stuff that&#x27;s good.&quot; Bob Shane remarked years later: &quot;To call the Kingston Trio folksingers was kind of stupid in the first place. We never called ourselves folksingers... We did folk-oriented material, but we did it amid all kinds of other stuff. But they didn&#x27;t know what to call us with our instruments, so Capitol Records called us folksingers and gave us credit for starting this whole boom.&quot;

===21st-century perspectives===
Over the years, the Kingston Trio expanded its song selection beyond the rearranged traditional numbers, calypso songs, and Broadway show tunes that had appeared on its first several albums. In an obituary for Nick Reynolds (d. October 1, 2008), Spencer Leigh wrote in Britain&#x27;s &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot;:
Looking at their repertoire now, it is apparent that the Kingston Trio was far more adventurous than is generally supposed. They introduced &quot;It Was A Very Good Year&quot; in 1961, later a standard for Frank Sinatra, and they were one of the first to spot the potential of English language versions of Jacques Brel&#x27;s songs by recording &quot;Seasons in the Sun&quot; in 1963. They encouraged young songwriters including Hoyt Axton (&quot;Greenback Dollar&quot;), Rod McKuen (&quot;Ally Ally Oxen Free&quot;, &quot;The World I Used to Know&quot;) and Billy Edd Wheeler (&quot;Reverend Mr Black&quot;). Best of all, in 1962 they introduced listeners to one of the most poignant songs ever written, the anti-war ballad &quot;Where Have All The Flowers Gone?&quot; by Pete Seeger, formerly with the Weavers.
Further, Peter Dreier points out that &quot;the group deserves credit for helping to launch the folk boom that brought recognition to older folkies and radicals like Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, and for paving the way for newcomers like Joan Baez, Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs, who were well known for their progressive political views and topical songs. By the time these younger folk singers arrived on the scene, the political climate had changed enough to provide a wide audience for protest music.&quot; Additionally, writing in the British daily &quot;The Guardian&quot;, also in an obituary for Reynolds, Ken Hunt asserted that &quot;[the Kingston Trio] helped to turn untold numbers of people on to folk music... [T]hey put the boom in folk boom... They were the greatest of the bands to emerge after the McCarthy-era blacklisting of folk musicians and breathed new air into the genre.&quot;

==Influence==
===On folk and pop music===
The Kingston Trio&#x27;s influence on the development of American popular music has been considerable. According to music critic Bruce Eder writing for Allmusic.com:
In the history of popular music, there are a relative handful of performers who have redefined the content of the music at critical points in history—people whose music left the landscape, and definition of popular music, altered completely. The Kingston Trio were one such group, transforming folk music into a hot commodity and creating a demand—where none had existed before—for young men (sometimes with women) strumming acoustic guitars and banjos and singing folk songs and folk-like novelty songs in harmony. On a purely commercial level, from 1957 until 1963, the Kingston Trio were the most vital and popular folk group in the world, and folk music was sufficiently popular as to make that a significant statement. Equally important, the original trio—Dave Guard, Nick Reynolds, and Bob Shane—in tandem with other, similar early acts such as the Limeliters, spearheaded a boom in the popularity of folk music that suddenly made the latter important to millions of listeners who previously had ignored it.
Discussing his earliest musical influences in a 2001 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Bob Dylan remembered:
There were other folk-music records, commercial folk-music records, like those by the Kingston Trio. I never really was an elitist. Personally, I liked the Kingston Trio. I could see the picture...the Kingston Trio were probably the best commercial group going, and they seemed to know what they were doing.
In his autobiography &quot;&quot;, Dylan added: &quot;I liked the Kingston Trio. Even though their style was polished and collegiate, I liked most of their stuff anyway.&quot;

In February 1982, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; writer Eric Zorn praised the Kingston Trio&#x27;s impact on the popular music industry, claiming that &quot;for almost five years, they overshadowed all other pop groups in America.&quot; He also noted that they &quot;so changed the course of popular music that their impact is largely felt to this day.&quot;

Jac Holzman, co-founder of the originally folk-based Elektra Records, remarked that his formerly struggling company&#x27;s new-found prosperity in the late 1950s resulted from &quot;The Kingston Trio which has the ability to capture the interest of a large number of people who have never been conscious of folk music before. In this respect, the Kingston Trio has put us on the map.&quot;
Even some staunch traditionalists from both the urban and rural folk music communities had an affinity for the Kingstons&#x27; polished commercial versions of older songs. In her memoir &quot;And A Voice To Sing With&quot;, singer and activist Joan Baez recalled that &quot;Traveling across the country with my mother and sisters, we heard the commercial songs of the budding folk boom for the first time, the Kingston Trio&#x27;s &#x27;Tom Dooley&#x27; and &#x27;Scotch and Soda.&#x27; Before I turned into a snob and learned to look down upon all commercial folk music as bastardized and unholy, I loved the Kingston Trio. When I became one of the leading practitioners of &#x27;pure folk,&#x27; I still loved them...&quot; Arthel &quot;Doc&quot; Watson of North Carolina, one of the most respected and influential musicians performing traditional music, remarked, &quot;I’ll tell you who pointed all our noses in the right direction, even the traditional performers. They got us interested in trying to put the good stuff out there—the Kingston Trio. They got me interested in it!&quot;

===On musicians===
Among the many other artists who cite the Kingston Trio as a formative influence in their musical careers are comedian, actor, and banjo player Steve Martin, Lindsey Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac, singer-songwriter Paul Simon, Timothy B. Schmit of The Eagles, pioneering folk-rock artist Gram Parsons, Stephen Stills and David Crosby of Crosby, Stills, and Nash, The Beach Boys&#x27; Al Jardine, Big Brother and the Holding Company founding member Peter Albin, Denny Doherty of The Mamas and the Papas, banjo master Tony Trischka, pop groups ABBA and The Bee Gees, Jefferson Airplane founding members Marty Balin and Paul Kantner, Buffalo Springfield founding member Richie Furay, Byrds co-founder Gene Clark, roots musician and master mandolin player David Grisman, singer-songwriters Tom Paxton,Harry Chapin, Jimmy Buffett, Tim Buckley, Steve Goodman, Steve Gillette, Michael Smith (composer of &quot;The Dutchman&quot;), and Shawn Colvin, folk-rock group We Five co-founder Jerry Burgan, folk and rock musician Jerry Yester, rock photographer and Modern Folk Quartet musician Henry Diltz, and progressive jazz vocal group Manhattan Transfer.

The classic stage look of The Beach Boys from the early to late 1960s, blue and white striped button-down shirts with either black or grey pants, was inspired by the Kingston Trio.

===On the music business===
The guitar manufacturer C.F. Martin &amp; Company has attributed the dramatic rise in demand for its instruments in the early 1960s in large part to the Kingston Trio&#x27;s use of the company&#x27;s guitars, which are featured prominently and without compensation on nearly all of their album covers. A Martin company press release in 2007, announcing a fourth Kingston Trio commemorative model guitar, stated that
...The Kingston Trio changed everything about popular music—and the entire acoustic guitar industry along with it...
It was the rise of the Kingston Trio that really established Martin as &quot;America&#x27;s Guitar&quot;...The Kingston Trio wasn&#x27;t just a musical group. It was a phenomenon, as influential in its time as The Beatles would become in theirs.
Satirist Tom Lehrer has acknowledged the Trio&#x27;s pioneering of college concerts, observing that before the Kingstons &quot;there was no real concert circuit...The Kingston Trio started all that,&quot; and in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, critic Richard Corliss asserted, &quot;In my youth, they changed pop music, and me with it.&quot;

<text>The Cut Bank Creek is a tributary of the Marias River in the Missouri River basin watershed, approximately 75 mi (123 km) long, in northwestern Montana in the United States, which having deeply eroded steep cliff banks eponymously gives name to the cut bank formal terrain term of geological science.

It rises in the Rocky Mountains in Glacier National Park at the continental divide and flows ENE onto the foothills and plains of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, then southeast, past Cut Bank, Montana where it forms a scenic gorge deep spanned by an elevated railway bridge just a mile from the town&#x27;s Amtrak rail transport system passenger station and BNSF railway freight yards. The river and cliff there are prototypical giving rise to the eponymous formally named &quot;cut bank&quot; geographic terrain feature archetype.
In southeastern Glacier County, approximately 12 mi (19 km) southeast of Cut Bank, it joins the Two Medicine River to form the Marias River.

There is a brewery in Cut Bank whose name is based on this creek.

<doc id="532353" wikidata="Q684021" url="?curid=532353" title="Baaba Maal">
<text>Baaba Maal (, born 13 June 1953) is a Senegalese singer and guitarist born in Podor, on the Senegal River. In addition to acoustic guitar, he also plays percussion. He has released several albums, both for independent and major labels. In July 2003, he was made a UNDP Youth Emissary.

Maal sings primarily in Pulaar and promotes the traditions of the Pulaar-speaking people, who live on either side of the Senegal River in the ancient Senegalese kingdom of Futa Tooro.

==Early life and education==
Maal was expected to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps and become a fisherman. However, under the influence of his lifelong friend and family gawlo, blind guitarist Mansour Seck, Maal devoted himself to learning music from his mother and his school&#x27;s headmaster. He went on to study music at the university in Dakar before leaving to study musical notation in Paris. During this time, he stayed for three years in the French capital, where he took courses at the Conservatoire de Paris, had private tuition and was taken with Mozart.

==Career==
After returning to Senegal, Maal studied traditional music with Mansour Seck and began performing with the band Daande Lenol. Maal&#x27;s fusions continued into the next decade with his &quot;Firin&#x27; in Fouta&quot; (1994) album, which used ragga, salsa and Breton harp music to create a popular sound that launched the careers of Positive Black Soul, a group of rappers, and also led to the formation of Afro Celt Sound System. His fusion tendencies continued on 1998&#x27;s &quot;Nomad Soul&quot;, which featured Brian Eno as one of seven producers. In addition to his various solo releases, he contributed to two tracks, &quot;Bushes&quot; and &quot;Dunya Salam&quot;, on the concept album &quot;1 Giant Leap&quot;.

In 1998, Maal recorded &quot;Bess, You Is My Woman Now&quot; for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Red Hot + Rhapsody: The Gershwin Groove&quot;, a tribute to George Gershwin that raised money for various charities devoted to increasing HIV/AIDS awareness and fighting the disease. In 2002, Maal again worked with the Red Hot Organization, recording &quot;No Agreement&quot; alongside Res, Tony Allen, Ray Lema, Positive Black Soul and Archie Shepp; as well as &quot;Trouble Sleep Yanga Wake Am&quot; alongside Taj Mahal and featuring Kaouding Cissoko and Antibalas, for the tribute album to Fela Kuti, &quot;Red Hot + Riot: The Music and Spirit of Fela Kuti&quot;.

On 7 July 2007, Maal performed at the Live Earth concert, Johannesburg.

Maal&#x27;s album &quot;On the Road&quot;, a live acoustic album recorded straight from the mixing boards of his shows over a 10-year period, was released in 2008. A new studio album, &quot;Television&quot;, was released in 2009.

He appears on two tracks &quot;Hunger&quot; and &quot;Still&quot; on the &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; film soundtrack and performed on the title track of the 2008 video game &quot;Far Cry 2&quot;, in addition to helping to create the whole soundtrack for that game. He played at Bonnaroo and the Sierra Nevada World Music Festival in 2010.

On 4 May 2013, Maal performed at the 2013 edition of the Harare International Festival of the Arts in Zimbabwe.

In 2014, he contributed to the BBC Music&#x27;s remake of The Beach Boys song &quot;God Only Knows&quot;.

Maal&#x27;s 11th studio album, &quot;The Traveller&quot;, recorded with Johan Hugo from the Very Best and Winston Marshall (Mumford &amp; Sons), was released via Palm and Marathon Artists The lead singles, &quot;Fulani Rock&quot; and &quot;Gilli Men&quot;, received critical acclaim. in January 2016, and was accompanied by a UK tour and headlining Senegal&#x27;s Festival Blues Du Fleuve. Maal accompanied Mumford &amp; Sons on their Gentlemen of the Road tour around South Africa in 2015. He also released a song and accompanying live performance music video with Mumford &amp; Sons called &quot;There Will Be Time&quot;.

In 1998 Maal was honoured by the Dutch-based Prince Claus Fund, which rewards people who have a progressive and contemporary approach to the themes of culture and development.

Maal voiced the Wakandan soundtrack of &quot;Black Panther&quot; for Ludwig Göransson, helping introduce Göransson to many of the African musicians who contributed to the score. Maal&#x27;s vocals can be heard on tracks &quot;Wakanda&quot; and &quot;A King&#x27;s Sunset.&quot; The two musicians rejoined each other to collaborate on the score for the sequel &quot;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&quot;, including Maal doing a brief cameo in the as a funeral singer. To celebrate the launch of the film&#x27;s trailer, Maal and Massamba Diop staged a performance at San Diego ComicCon. His vocals can be heard on the sole track, &quot;Nyana Wam.&quot;

In an interview with The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2020, Maal discussed the ritual quality of traditional instruments, and how he chooses instruments to convey his songs&#x27; messages: &quot;The spirit of the kora and the ngoni are different from the talking drum and the balafon, or the sabar and the djembe. The kora and ngoni are closer to human beings, because they are made from things that had life. The talking drum, the balafon, and the sabar are made from wood, and when you listen to them your mind goes out into the forest. When you make music and write songs, you have to know about the messages. From the messages, you know what the instruments are and how to put them together underneath the lyrics.&quot;

==Humanitarian works==
Early in his career, Baab Maal advocated disease prevention and poverty relief in Africa, with his songs often reflecting the social and health challenges of the continent. In July 2003, he was made a UNDP Youth Emissary.

On March 28, 2016, Maal launched Nann-K, a charity focusing on global sustainable development. Maal performed at the launch, which took place on International Women’s Day to honor the role of women in business development in Africa. NANN-K&#x27;s mission is to assist people from Senegal and other African countries in pursuing agricultural careers, including farming, animal husbandry, and fishing. According to their website, &quot;All these are time-old rural pursuits but they have never been organized or brought into the 21st century, let alone combined with the latest digital thinking.&quot;

On December 11, 2019, Maal promised to fight the desertification in the Sahel by planting trees. He said he hoped every person in Senegal could say they planted a tree.

In April 2023, Maal was named a UNCCD (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification) Goodwill Ambassador after a stint serving as UNCCD Land Ambassador alongside fellow Malian musician Inna Modja.

<text>Medical astrology or astrological medicine (traditionally known as iatromathematics) is an ancient applied branch of astrology based mostly on &quot;melothesia&quot; (Gr. μελοθεσία), the association of various parts of the body, diseases, and drugs with the nature of the sun, moon, planets, and the twelve astrological signs. The underlying basis for medical astrology is considered to be a pseudoscience as there is no scientific basis for its core beliefs.

Hippocratic Greek medical training included a doctrine of &quot;dies decretorii&quot; (&quot;critical days&quot;). Galen believed that heavenly bodies influenced human life but he had his misgivings about the predictions made by &quot;horoscope-casters&quot; (genethliakoi). Astrology was however considered as a foundation for medical practice in ancient Greece and Arabia. In Italy astrological studies as part of a training for medicine was routine in Bologna. The training was not that strong in England but in medical practice astrological circumstances were claimed in cases to absolve surgeons of any blame. In England, Robert Fludd in his &quot;Medicina Catholica&quot; (Frankfort, 1629) noted that medicine, theology, and astrology formed a single unified discipline. Astrological medicine declined after the 17th century but there were calls for its renewal in 1928 by Rudyard Kipling who considered modern medicine too narrow.

<doc id="532361" wikidata="Q120595" url="?curid=532361" title="N or M?">
<text>N or M? is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie first published in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company in 1941 and in the UK by the Collins Crime Club in November of the same year. The US edition retailed $2.00 and the UK edition at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6).

The title is taken from a catechism in the Book of Common Prayer which asks, &quot;What is your Christian name? Answer N. or M.&quot; The &quot;N. or M.&quot; here stands for the Latin, &quot;nomen vel nomina&quot;, meaning &quot;name or names&quot;. It was an accident of typography that &quot;nomina&quot; came to be represented by &quot;m&quot;.

The novel is the first to feature the mature versions of her detectives Tommy and Tuppence, whose previous appearances had been in the adventure &quot;The Secret Adversary&quot; (1922) and the short story collection &quot;Partners in Crime&quot; (1929).

==Plot introduction==
After the outbreak of the Second World War and many years after they worked for British intelligence, middle-aged Tommy and Tuppence Beresford feel useless and sidelined. Then, Tommy is approached by a secret agent named Grant to go undercover once more. Grant tries to find German spies and fifth columnists but is hampered by traitors within British intelligence who follow and sabotage his work. Since Tommy has not been in the field for many years, nobody knows him, and he can investigate unofficially.

Grant explains that another British agent was recently murdered but left a cryptic message on his deathbed: &quot;N or M. Song Susie&quot;. Grant suspects that &quot;Song Susie&quot; stands for &quot;Sans Souci&quot;, a hotel in (fictional) seaside Leahampton (based on Bournemouth), and &quot;N&quot; and &quot;M&quot; are known to be two top German spies, one male and one female. Tommy is to go to &quot;Sans Souci&quot; to investigate whether N, M or both are at the hotel and to figure out their identities.

Tommy is sent alone, but Tuppence decides to join him on his mission whether invited or not. Through good sleuthing, she learns where he is to be sent and arrives there before he does. Working together under separate false identities, they begin a search for the spies among the residents of the resort town. As everyone seems, in turn, suspicious and not, Tommy and Tuppence follow exciting leads that lead close to peril.

Both N and M&#x27;s identities are revealed at the end of the book; &quot;N&quot; is a top German spy, who is shot by British intelligence at the book&#x27;s conclusion as he threatens Tuppence&#x27;s life, and &quot;M&quot; is his female co-conspirator.

==Literary significance and reception==
Maurice Willson Disher&#x27;s review in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; of 29 November 1941 began, &quot;To believe that &quot;N or M?&quot; is not Miss Agatha Christie&#x27;s best is difficult while the first fine anxious rapture of her latest story is still troubling the mind.&quot; He concluded, &quot;The point is reached when you begin to fear for your own sanity on catching yourself wondering whether an ingratiating babe-in-arms might not be Herr Doktor in disguise. Yet such is Miss Christie&#x27;s skill in conjuring up the ominous that even infant prattle sounds uncommonly like a code for the Fifth Column. In other words, as Mr Robey has said before now, &quot;N or M?&quot; gets you.&quot;

Maurice Richardson in a short review in the 7 December 1941 issue of &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote: &quot;Agatha Christie takes time off from Poirot and the haute cuisine of crime to write a light war-time spy thriller. &quot;N or M&quot; is [an] unknown master fifth columnist concealed in [the] person of some shabby genteel figure in a Bournemouth boarding-house ... Christie&#x27;s bright young couple, now middle-aged but active as ever, are nearly trapped. Nice surprise finish and all-round entertainment.&quot;

A short review by E.R. Punshon in &quot;The Guardian&quot; of 30 December 1941 ended with &quot;Mrs Christie shows herself as ingenious as ever, and one admires especially the way in which the hero snores himself out of captivity.&quot;

In 1990, in a revised edition of his 1980 work, Robert Barnard wrote: &quot;The Beresfords contribute their intolerable high spirits to the war effort. Less racist than the earlier thrillers (in fact, some apology is made indirectly) but no more convincing.&quot;

==MI5 investigation of Christie==
Around 1941 or 1942, the British intelligence agency MI5 temporarily investigated Christie herself as she had named one of her characters in this novel as a certain Major Bletchley. MI5 was afraid that Christie had a spy in Britain&#x27;s top-secret codebreaking centre, Bletchley Park. MI5&#x27;s fears were eventually assuaged when Christie revealed to Dilly Knox, who helped break the Enigma machine cypher used by German secret service officers sending spies to Britain, that Major Bletchley, &quot;one of my least lovable characters&quot;, was merely named after the town of Bletchley (now part of Milton Keynes) which she once happened to be stuck in during a train journey.

==TV adaptation==
The UK television channel BBC One began airing a 3-part adaptation of &quot;N or M?&quot; on 16 August 2015. The adaptation was aired as part of the &quot;Partners in Crime&quot; series.

<text>USS &quot;Antietam&quot; (CG-54) was a guided missile cruiser of the United States Navy. &quot;Antietam&quot; was named for the site of the 1862 Battle of Antietam, Maryland, between Confederate forces under General Robert E. Lee and Union forces under Major General George McClellan, during the American Civil War. &quot;Antietam&quot; earned the 2007 and 2008 Battle Efficiency awards, also known as the &quot;Navy E&quot; or &quot;Battle E&quot; award, for the &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; Strike Group.

==Construction==
&quot;Antietam&quot; was laid down by the Litton-Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation at Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 15 November 1984, launched on 14 February 1986, and commissioned on 6 June 1987 in Baltimore, Maryland.

==Public relations==
From 1988 to 1991, the ship was assigned to Naval Surface Group, Long Beach, which was part of Commander, Naval Surface Forces Pacific, and available for tours.

The ship was featured in &quot;Visiting... with Huell Howser&quot; Episode 327, filmed in 1995.

==Capability==
The ship is armed with guided missiles and rapid-fire guns. She also carries two Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk LAMPS helicopters, capable of multiple missions, but primarily equipped for antisubmarine warfare (ASW).

==Ship history==
&quot;Antietam&quot; was one of the first vessels to take part in Operation Desert Shield, along with the rest of the Battlegroup in August 1990, in response to the Invasion of Kuwait. &quot;Antietam&quot; then returned to the United States on 20 December 1990. According to an interview in 2007 BBC documentary, &quot;The Last Flight to Kuwait&quot;, Lawrence Eddingfield, who was captain at that time stated that the vessel was involved in a helicopter rescue of two British SAS troops who had arrived on BA 149 during the invasion.

In March 2003, &quot;Antietam&quot; was assigned to Carrier Group Three.

&quot;Antietam&quot; operated out of her home port of San Diego, California. From February to August 2005, &quot;Antietam&quot; completed a circumnavigation of Earth, leaving San Diego to the west and returning home by way of the east. During the deployment, she had an extended stay in the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. From January to August 2007, &quot;Antietam&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf. During that seven-month deployment, she visited Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Pearl Harbor before returning to home port. In 2009, she completed a six-month deployment, leaving San Diego in January 2009, and returning home in July 2009. Stops along the way included Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Guam, and Hawaii.

In February 2013, &quot;Antietam&quot; relieved in a &quot;hull-swap&quot; at Yokosuka, Japan, in which the two crews swapped ships. &quot;Cowpens&quot;, previously deployed to Yokosuka, was then homeported at Naval Base San Diego, California, while &quot;Antietam&quot; took up her new homeport at Yokosuka.
On 31 January 2017, &quot;Antietam&quot; ran aground in Tokyo Bay near her home port of Yokosuka, Japan. &quot;Antietam&quot; was anchored off the coast in winds and a strong tide when the crew noticed the ship was dragging her anchor. They got the ship underway, but shortly after doing so, they felt the ship shudder as she lost all pitch control in both propellers. They had run aground on a shoal with damage to both propellers and one of the propeller hubs, causing of hydraulic oil to leak into the water. No personnel were injured during the incident. Repairs cost at least $4.2 million.

On 22 October 2018, she transited the Taiwan Strait along with the destroyer . On 24–25 July 2019, she again transited the Taiwan Strait. On 19–20 September 2019 she transited the Taiwan Strait a third time. During at least one of these transits, a Chinese WZ-7 HALE drone as well as Shenyang J-11 strike fighters followed her and warned one of their helicopters that it was flying too close to the mainland.

In December 2020 the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Report to Congress on the Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels stated that the ship was planned to be placed Out of Commission in Reserve in 2024.

In May 2022, &quot;Antietam&quot; was homeported at Yokosuka, Japan. She was part of Carrier Strike Group 5 led by the aircraft carrier . On 28 August 2022, &quot;Antietam&quot; along with sister ship conducted a routine transit through the Taiwan Strait. This was the first such transit to occur since the 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.

On 25 June 2023, &quot;Antietam&quot;, along with aircraft carrier &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; and cruiser , paid a visit to Vietnam. They docked at Tien Sa port, Da Nang and stayed there until 30 June.

On 5 February 2024, the U.S. Navy announced that USS McCampbell (DDG 85) will forward deploy to Yokosuka, Japan. &quot;McCampbell&quot; will replace USS &quot;Antietam&quot; (CG 54), which will depart Yokosuka, Japan, in January, after 11 years of forward deployed service and move to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, as part of a scheduled rotation of forces in the Pacific.

In March 2024, the Navy announced plans to inactivate &quot;Antietam&quot; on 27 September 2024.

<text>The Two Medicine River is a tributary of the Marias River, approximately 60 mi (97 km) long, in northwestern Montana in the United States.

It rises in the Rocky Mountain Front in Glacier National Park at the continental divide and flows east, down from the mountains and across the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. It receives Birch Creek in southeastern Glacier County and joins Cut Bank Creek to form the Marias, approximately 12 mi (19 km) southeast of Cut Bank.

<doc id="532364" wikidata="Q1473121" url="?curid=532364" title="USS Anzio (CG-68)">
<text>USS &quot;Anzio&quot; (CG-68) is a guided missile cruiser that served in the United States Navy. She was named for the site of a beachhead invasion of Italy by Allied troops from 22 January to 23 May 1944. Her keel was laid down by the Litton-Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation at Pascagoula, Mississippi on 21 August 1989. The ship was launched on 2 November 1990, and commissioned on 2 May 1992. &quot;Anzio&quot; was decommissioned on 22 September 2022.

==History==

===2000s===
On 6 April 2000, &quot;Anzio&quot;, along with another cruiser and the aircraft carrier , was participating in an exercise in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, about off the coast of Israel. In an unannounced missile test, the Israel Defense Forces fired a Jericho-1 medium-range ballistic missile from a test facility in Yavne, which landed from the ship. The missile was detected by the ship&#x27;s radar, and the crew briefly thought that they were under attack.

On 9 January 2003, &quot;Anzio&quot; was pre-deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Ordered first to the eastern Mediterranean Sea for the initial phase of President George W. Bush&#x27;s Shock and Awe strategy (during which the U.S. Navy deployed to defeat the Iraq military before ground forces were sent in). Once &quot;Anzio&quot; completed her mission in the eastern Mediterranean, she forward-deployed to the Persian Gulf. Once &quot;Anzio&quot; arrived in the Persian Gulf, she had marked her 45th straight day at sea. In the Persian Gulf, &quot;Anzio&quot; continued carrier-flight support operations and coastal surveillance. After President Bush announced major combat had concluded in the Iraq War, on 1 May 2003, &quot;Anzio&quot; was relieved of her duties, returning home on 3 July 2003, after 175 days at sea. In March 2003, she was assigned to Cruiser-Destroyer Group Eight.

On 16 February 2007, &quot;Anzio&quot; was awarded the 2006 Battle &quot;E&quot; award.

&quot;Anzio&quot; has served as the flagship of the Horn of Africa international anti-piracy Combined Task Force 151. On 15 October 2009 a team from the cruiser working with United States Coast Guard personnel from Maritime Safety and Security Team 91104 seized a skiff carrying an estimated 4 tons of hashish worth an estimated $28 million about southwest of Salalah, Oman. The boarding team destroyed the drugs by dumping them into the ocean and released the skiff&#x27;s crew.

===2010s===
&quot;Anzio&quot; was tentatively scheduled to be decommissioned and designated for disposal on 31 March 2013. However, &quot;Anzio&quot; was retained under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013.

On 13 January 2016, ten U.S. Navy sailors were picked up by &quot;Anzio&quot; for transport and medical evaluations after being held in Iranian custody. The sailors were captured by Iran on 12 January 2016 after their two naval boats entered Iranian waters. &quot;The evidence suggests that they unintentionally entered the Iranian waters because of the failure of their navigational system,&quot; Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps spokesman Ramazan Sharif said on Press TV. &quot;Anzio&quot; was also involved in a replenishment at sea operation with , , , , and .

===2020s===
In December 2020 the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Report to Congress on the Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels stated that the ship was planned to be placed Out of Commission in Reserve in 2022.

On 22 September 2022, &quot;Anzio&quot; was decommissioned at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia after 30 years of service.

<text>USS &quot;Bainbridge&quot; (DLGN-25/CGN-25) was a nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser in the United States Navy, the only ship of her class. Named in honor of Commodore William Bainbridge, she was the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name. With her original hull classification symbol of DLGN (nuclear-powered guided missile destroyer leader, called a &quot;frigate&quot; at the time), she was the first nuclear-powered destroyer-type ship in the US Navy, and shared her name with the lead ship of the first US Navy destroyer class, the s.

&quot;Bainbridge&quot; was re-designated as a guided missile cruiser in 1975. She was commissioned in 1962, and served for over 30 years in the Atlantic, Pacific, Mediterranean, and Middle East before being decommissioned in 1996.

==Construction==
&quot;Bainbridge&quot; was designed and built by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation at Fore River Shipyard at Quincy, Massachusetts. Commissioned in October 1962, she shook down off the East Coast and in the Caribbean area until February 1963, when she began her first Mediterranean deployment. This included demonstrations of her long-range high-speed dash capabilities and operations with the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier . &quot;Bainbridge&quot; returned to the Mediterranean Sea in May 1964, this time joining &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the guided missile cruiser to form the all-nuclear-powered Task Force 1. At the end of July, the three nuclear powered ships began Operation &quot;Sea Orbit&quot;, a 30,565 mile, 65 day unrefueled cruise around the world.

==History==

In October 1965, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; again rounded Cape Agulhas, en route to the Western Pacific for the first of eleven Seventh Fleet cruises. Operating for much of this deployment off strife-torn Vietnam, she screened aircraft carriers, served as a radar-picket ship, and performed search and rescue missions. In June, the frigate crossed the Pacific to her new home port, Long Beach, California. Her next five Far Eastern tours, in 1966–67, 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972–73, also involved Vietnam War combat operations, as well as voyages to Australia and, beginning in 1970, the Indian Ocean. In 1967–1968, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; underwent shipyard overhaul and her first nuclear refueling. The ship&#x27;s seventh trip to the Far East, beginning in November 1973, included a lengthy visit to the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea, a locale that would become very familiar in the coming decades.

&quot;Bainbridge&quot; received an extensive modernization and refueling between June 1974 and September 1976, with post-overhaul work lasting until April 1977. While in the shipyard, at the end of June 1975, she was reclassified from frigate (destroyer leader) to cruiser, receiving the new designation &quot;CGN-25&quot;. Her next Seventh Fleet deployment ran from January to August 1978 and included visits throughout the region, from Japan and South Korea to Thailand and Singapore, with her homeward-bound voyage taking her to Australia and through the South Pacific. &quot;Bainbridge&quot; made three more WestPac tours, in 1979–80, 1981 and 1982–83, each involving extensive operations in the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea.

==1980s–1990s==
In 1982 she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award.

After receiving her final nuclear refueling overhaul in 1983–85, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; left the Pacific after two decades, transited the Panama Canal and rejoined the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. Her operations thereafter included counter-drug smuggling patrols in the Caribbean, several deployments to northern European waters and four Mediterranean cruises 1986–87, 1988–89—including combat operations off Libya, 1991–92—with a Red Sea and Persian Gulf tour, and 1994 as Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT).

The 1994 deployment supported United Nations resolutions that became part of Operation Sharp Guard, which enforced sanctions against the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. During these operations, she safely conducted over 100 boardings of merchant vessels to inspect for illegal cargo shipments. &quot;Bainbridge&quot; also supported Operation Deny Flight, where she acted as &quot;REDCROWN&quot; coordinating the air warfare environment over Bosnia. &quot;Bainbridge&quot;″s AAW suite could provide almost complete radar coverage of the airspace over Bosnia and the Adriatic. With her SM-2 ER missiles, she could engage more than 16 aircraft or cruise missiles simultaneously; and at ranges in excess of .

==Decommissioning==
Deactivated in October 1995, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; was officially decommissioned in September 1996. She was towed to Bremerton, Washington in mid-1997, and in October of that year entered dry dock to begin &quot;recycling,&quot; the process by which nuclear-powered warships are scrapped.

<doc id="532369" wikidata="Q427002" url="?curid=532369" title="DIGITAL Command Language">
<text>DIGITAL Command Language (DCL) is the standard command language adopted by many of the operating systems created by Digital Equipment Corporation. DCL had its roots in IAS, TOPS-20, and RT-11 and was implemented as a standard across most of Digital&#x27;s operating systems, notably RSX-11 and RSTS/E, but took its most powerful form in VAX/VMS (later OpenVMS). DCL continues to be developed by VSI as part of OpenVMS.

Written when the programming language Fortran was in heavy use, DCL is a scripting language supporting several data types, including strings, integers, bit arrays, arrays and Booleans, but not floating point numbers. Access to OpenVMS &quot;system services&quot; (kernel API) is through lexical functions, which perform the same as their compiled language counterparts and allow scripts to get information on system state. DCL includes IF-THEN-ELSE, access to all the Record Management Services (RMS) file types including stream, indexed, and sequential, but lacks a DO-WHILE or other looping construct, requiring users to make do with IF and GOTO-label statements instead.

DCL is available for other operating systems as well, including 
* VCL and VX/DCL for Unix, 
* VCL for MS-DOS, OS/2 and Windows, 
* PC-DCL and Open DCL for Windows/Linux
* and Accelr8 DCL Lite for Windows.

DCL is the basis of the XLNT language, implemented on Windows by an interpreter-IDE-WSH engine combination with CGI capabilities distributed by Advanced System Concepts Inc. from 1997.

==Command-line parser==
For the OpenVMS implementation, the command line parser is a runtime library () that can be compiled into user applications and therefore gives a consistent command line interface for both OS supplied commands and user written commands. The command line must start with a verb and is then followed by up to 8 parameters (arguments) and/or qualifiers (switches in Unix terminology) which begin with a &#x27;/&#x27; character. Unlike Unix (but similar to DOS), a space is not required before the &#x27;/&#x27;. Qualifiers can be position independent (occurring anywhere on the command line) or position dependent, in which case the qualifier affects the parameter it appears after. Most qualifiers are position independent. Qualifiers may also be assigned values or a series of values. Only the first most significant part of the verb and qualifier name is required. Parameters can be integers or alphanumeric text.

An example OS command may look like:

set audit /alarm /enable=(authorization, breakin=all)
show device /files $1$DGA1424:

The second &quot;show&quot; command could also be typed as:
 sho dev $1$DGA1424:/fil

While DCL documentation usually shows all DCL commands in uppercase, DCL commands are case-insensitive and may be typed in upper-, lower-, or mixed-case.

Some implementations such as OpenVMS and RSX used a minimum uniqueness scheme in allowing commands to be shortened.

Unlike other systems which use &quot;paths&quot; for locating commands, DCL requires commands to be defined explicitly, either via CLD (Command Language Definition) definitions or a &quot;foreign symbol&quot;. Most OpenVMS-native commands are defined via CLD files; these are compiled by the CDU, the Command Definition Utility, and added to a DCL &#x27;table&#x27; -- by default, although processes are free to use their own tables—and can then be invoked by the user. For example, defining a command FOO that accepts the option &quot;/BAR&quot; and is implemented by the image could be done with a CLD file similar to:

DEFINE VERB FOO
 IMAGE &quot;SYS$SYSEXE:FOO.EXE&quot;
 QUALIFIER BAR

The user can then type &quot;, or &quot;, and the FOO program will be invoked. The command definition language supports many types of options, for example dates and file specifications, and allows a qualifier to change the image invoked—for example &quot;, to create a file, vs. &quot; to create a directory.

The other (simpler, but less flexible) method to define commands is via &quot;foreign commands&quot;. This is more akin to the Unix method of invoking programs. By giving the command:

foo :== $sys$sysexe:foo.exe

the command &#x27;FOO&#x27; will invoke FOO.EXE, and supply any additional arguments literally to the program, for example, &quot;&quot;. This method is generally used for programs ported from Unix and other non-native systems; for C programs using argc and argv command syntax.

Versions of OpenVMS DCL starting with V6.2 support the logical name for establishing Unix-style command paths. This mechanism is known as an Automatic Foreign Command. allows a list of directories to be specified, and these directories are then searched for DCL command procedures (&quot;command&quot;.COM) and then for executable images (&quot;command&quot;.EXE) with filenames that match the command that was input by the user. Like traditional foreign commands, automatic foreign commands also allow Unix-style command input.

==Scripting==
DCL scripts look much like any other scripting language, with some exceptions. All DCL verbs in a script are preceded with a $ symbol; other lines are considered to be input to the previous command. For example, to use the TYPE command to print a paragraph onto the screen, one might use a script similar to:

$ TYPE SYS$INPUT:
This is an example of using the TYPE verb
in the DCL language.
$ EXIT
==Indirect variable referencing==
It is possible to build arrays in DCL that are referenced through translated symbols. This allows the programmer to build arbitrarily sized data structures using the data itself as an indexing function. 

$ i = 1
$ variable&#x27;i&#x27; = &quot;blue&quot;
$ i = 2 
$ variable&#x27;i&#x27; = &quot;green&quot;
$ j = 1
$ color = variable&#x27;j&#x27;
$ rainbow&#x27;color&#x27; = &quot;red&quot;
$ color = variable&#x27;i&#x27;
$ rainbow&#x27;color&#x27; = &quot;yellow&quot;

In this example the variable is assigned the value &quot;red&quot;, and is assigned the value &quot;yellow&quot;.

==Commands==

The following is a list of DCL commands for common computing tasks that are supported by the OpenVMS command-line interface.
* COPY
* COPY/FTP
* CREATE
* DELETE
* DIRECTORY
* EDIT
* LOGOUT
* PRINT
* RENAME
* SET
* SHOW
* TYPE
==Lexical functions==
Lexical functions provide string functions and access to VMS-maintained data.

Some Lexicals are:
* extract a substring
* obtain date/time info, e.g. 
* for would return 
* searches for a file, returns a null (&quot;&quot;) if not found
* it&#x27;s a privilege to have access to this.

<text>USS &quot;Belknap&quot; (DLG-26/CG-26), named for Rear Admirals George E. Belknap (1832–1903) and his son Reginald Rowan Belknap (1871–1959), was the lead ship of her class of guided missile cruisers in the United States Navy. She was launched in 1963 as DLG-26, a guided missile frigate under the then-current designation system, and reclassified as CG-26 on 30 June 1975.

On 22 November 1975, &quot;Belknap&quot; and the aircraft carrier collided, killing seven sailors on the cruiser and one on the aircraft carrier.

== Construction ==
&quot;Belknap&quot;, the first of a new class of guided missile frigates, was laid down by the Bath Iron Works Corporation at Bath in Maine on 5 February 1962. She was christened by Mrs. Leonard B. Cresswell, the granddaughter and daughter of the RADMs Belknap and was launched by the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine on 20 July 1963 and commissioned on 7 November 1964.

== Collision, fire, and reconstruction ==

&quot;Belknap&quot; was severely damaged in a collision with the aircraft carrier on 22 November 1975 off the coast of Sicily. A fire broke out on &quot;Belknap&quot; following the collision, during which her aluminum superstructure collapsed after it was weakened by the heat. Seven sailors were killed on &quot;Belknap&quot; and one on &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;.

Shortly after the fire began, boats from other vessels operating with &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; and &quot;Belknap&quot; began to pull alongside the burning ship, often with complete disregard for their own safety. The guided missile destroyer and destroyer moved in on both sides of &quot;Belknap&quot;, their men directing fire hoses into the amidships area that the stricken ship&#x27;s crew could not reach. &quot;Bordelon&quot; was also badly damaged in a collision with &quot;Kennedy&quot; the following year, forcing her removal from service. &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; moved in, secured alongside &quot;Belknap&quot; port side, and evacuated the injured while fragments from exploding ammunition showered down upon her weather decks. The frigate closed in the carrier&#x27;s starboard side to provide firefighting assistance. Ammunition from &quot;Belknap&quot; three-inch ready storage locker, located amidships, cooked off, hurling fiery fragments into the air and splashing around the rescue boats. Undaunted, the rescuers pulled out the seriously wounded and delivered fire-fighting supplies to the sailors, who refused to surrender their ship to the conflagration.

The ammunition ship was involved later in the rescue and salvage of &quot;Belknap&quot;, escorting her to an ammunition depot and then providing electric and water services as &quot;Mount Baker&quot; Explosive Ordnance Disposal team retrieved all of the remaining ammunition from &quot;Belknap&quot;. &quot;Mount Baker&quot; also took aboard most of &quot;Belknap&quot; crew until they could be transferred to a way station for reassignment.

The fire and the resultant damage and deaths, which would have been less had &quot;Belknap&quot; superstructure been made of steel, helped persuade the U.S. Navy to pursue all-steel construction in future classes of surface combatants. However, in 1987, the New York Times cited cracking in aluminum superstructures such as what occurred in the s, rather than fire, as the reason the Navy returned to steel on some ships. The first USN combatant ships to revert to all steel superstructure were the , which were commissioned beginning in the 1990s. &quot;Belknap&quot; was reconstructed by the Philadelphia Navy Yard from 30 January 1976 to 10 May 1980. Since the hull was still in good condition the Navy decided to use this as a test platform for the Aegis class cruiser electronics and updated weapons systems. Until the Aegis class cruisers came along, &quot;Belknap&quot; was one of the most powerful warships in the world and saw service in Beirut as part of the multinational peacekeeping force, becoming the first American ship to fire on an enemy since the Vietnam War. It was the ship&#x27;s Naval Tactical Data Systems&#x27; (NTDS) reliability during this time in Beirut that was named as the defining reason that the &quot;Belknap&quot; was chosen as the Sixth Fleet flagship.

== Later service and Malta ==
&quot;Belknap&quot; was converted to a flagship by Norfolk Naval Shipyard from May 1985 to February 1986. This conversion work entailed building out the superstructure forward to just aft of the missile launcher and three decks up to add flag spaces (accommodation and office), and additional communications gear. In addition, the helicopter hangar aft was turned into accommodation spaces for flag staff and a small detachment of Marines. After this conversion she sailed to Italy [Gaeta naval base] and became Sixth Fleet flagship, relieving . On 27 May 1986, she participated in a naval parade with ships from 10 countries at Barcelona.

&quot;Belknap&quot; played a role in the Malta Summit between U.S. President George H. W. Bush and Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev on 2 December and 3 December 1989. President Bush, along with his advisers, James Baker, John Sununu and Brent Scowcroft, had their sleeping quarters aboard &quot;Belknap&quot;, whereas the Soviet delegation used the missile cruiser &quot;Slava&quot;. The ships were anchored in a roadstead off the coast of Marsaxlokk. Stormy weather and choppy seas resulted in some meetings being canceled or rescheduled, and gave rise to the moniker the &quot;Seasick Summit&quot; among international media. In the end, the meetings took place aboard &quot;Maksim Gorkiy&quot;, a Soviet cruise ship anchored in the harbor at La Valletta. Engineers from the Navy Ship Systems Engineering Station devised a mooring arrangement for this event, and, despite the worst-case 100-year storm event, &quot;Belknap&quot; held its ground using emergency operating procedures as outlined by the engineers.

== Decommissioning ==
&quot;Belknap&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 February 1995 and sunk as a target on 24 September 1998.

<doc id="532372" wikidata="Q471346" url="?curid=532372" title="Philippe Buonarroti">
<text>Filippo Giuseppe Maria Ludovico Buonarroti (11 November 1761 – 16 September 1837), more usually referred to by the French version Philippe Buonarroti, was an Italian-French utopian socialist, writer, agitator, freemason, and conspirator. He was active in Corsica, France, and Geneva. His &quot;History of Babeuf’s Conspiracy of Equals&quot; (1828) became a quintessential text for revolutionaries, inspiring such socialists as Louis Auguste Blanqui and Karl Marx. He proposed a mutualist strategy that would revolutionize society by stages, starting from monarchy to liberalism, then to radicalism, and finally to communism.

== Life ==
=== Early activism ===
Buonarroti was born in Pisa in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany to a family of local nobility, the same Buonarroti family to which Michelangelo belonged. He studied law at the University of Pisa, where he founded what was seen by the authorities of Grand Duke Peter Leopold as a subversive paper, the &quot;Gazetta Universale&quot; (1787).

It is thought that he joined a Masonic Lodge sometime in 1786.

Though under constant surveillance by the authorities, he expressed support for the French Revolution when it broke out. He travelled to Corsica to spread the revolutionary message with the &quot;Giornale Patriottico di Corsica&quot;, the first Italian-language paper to openly support the French Revolution. In Corsica, Buonarroti joined the Jacobin Club, and became a friend of the Bonapartes.

=== Under the Convention ===
Buonarroti was expelled from the island in June 1791 and returned to his native Tuscany whereupon he was arrested and imprisoned.

In 1793 he travelled to Paris and became a member of the Society of the Panthéon. Maximilien Robespierre placed him in charge of organizing the expatriate Italian revolutionaries, which he did from a base in Nice. After denouncing Pasquale Paoli to the National Convention, he was rewarded for his revolutionary activities by a special decree of French citizenship in May 1793.

In April 1794 he was nominated National Commissioner in Oneglia, Imperia&#x27;s port, the site of refuge for many pro-French Italians during the French attack on Northern Italy.

=== Babeuf conspiracy and later life ===
He was recalled to Paris in 1795, after the Thermidorian Reaction, whereupon he was imprisoned in the Plessis prison after his friends in office had been deposed by the Thermidorian Reaction. There he met Gracchus Babeuf, and became one of his most fervent supporters and co-conspirators during the time of their mutual imprisonment from March to October.

Buonarotti was rearrested by the French Directory on 8 May 1796, along with Babeuf and other conspirators. Babeuf was guillotined, and Buonarotti formally imprisoned in February 1797, and held on the island of Oléron. Napoleon Bonaparte allowed him to go free after he had become First Consul in 1799.

He exiled himself to Geneva during the Empire, and to Brussels during the Bourbon Restoration. In 1808 Buonarroti formed a Masonic Lodge, &quot;Les Sublimes Maîtres Parfaits&quot; (The Sublime Perfect Masters), to which only serving freemasons were admitted. Within this lodge, he formed an inner circle which he used to further his political dreams and aspirations. He returned to Paris after the 1830 July Revolution. He was then acquainted with Marc-René de Voyer de Paulmy d&#x27;Argenson, Charles Teste, Ulysse Trélat, Hareau, François-Vincent Raspail, Louis Blanc and Auguste Blanqui.

He died suddenly in Paris.

== Influence ==

Buonarroti&#x27;s revolutionary principles were to prove important during the 1830s and early 1840s; Auguste Blanqui learned many of his insurrectionary skills and tactics from Buonarroti, and the &quot;Conspiration pour l&#x27;Egalité dite de Babeuf, suivie du procès auquel elle donna lieu&quot; may be seen as an important text in this respect.

Later, the 1848 revolutionaries in France and elsewhere placed much emphasis on this work as a cornerstone.

Mikhail Bakunin praised Buonarroti as &quot;the greatest conspirator of his age&quot;, and was heavily influenced by the revolutionary practice of Buonarroti. The Bakunin scholar Arthur Lehning has written of Buonarroti: “He too built up on an international scale, though over a much longer period, an elaborate underground network, on a freemason pattern, sometimes using Masonic institutions, to work for his egalitarian creed of 1796, for a social revolution and for the republicanisation of Europe. For forty years the principles remained the same: the leadership was secret; the existence of the higher grades was unknown to the lower; protean in character, this network took advantage of and used other societies.” Some argue that these principles are clearly evident in Bakunin&#x27;s writings.

<text>USS &quot;Biddle&quot; (DLG-34/CG-34) was a guided missile frigate/cruiser of the United States Navy. She saw action in Vietnam, where she is believed to be the last ship to down an enemy aircraft with hand-loaded guns. She was involved in the Gulf of Sidra incident in 1981. The cruiser was decommissioned on 30 November 1993 and sold for scrap on 4 December 2000.

==History==
&quot;Biddle&quot; was laid down by the Bath Iron Works Corporation at Bath, Maine on 9 December 1963, launched on 2 July 1965 and commissioned as DLG-34 on 21 January 1967. She was named for Captain Nicholas Biddle of the Continental Navy. Her call sign was &quot;Hard Charger&quot;.

Five months after commissioning, &quot;Biddle&quot; completed preparations for her final acceptance trials, concluded those trials, and conducted shakedown training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She completed shakedown on 29 May and headed, via Yorktown, Virginia, to Boston, Massachusetts. The Destroyer Leader &quot;guided-missile&quot; arrived in Boston on 2 June and began post-shakedown availability at the Boston Naval Shipyard five days later. &quot;Biddle&quot; completed the availability on 30 October and got underway for her new home port, Norfolk, Virginia, the following day. The warship entered Hampton Roads early in November, but stayed only four days, putting to sea on 7 November for the first in a series of exercise and weapons-qualifications cruises to the Caribbean. Those at-sea periods occupied her until mid-December when she began holiday standdown and preparations for overseas movement.

On 22 January 1968, &quot;Biddle&quot; put to sea bound ultimately for the combat zone off the coast of Vietnam. Along the way, she transited the Panama Canal and made stops at Pearl Harbor and Guam before reaching her base of operations at Subic Bay in the Philippines on 24 February. After an availability, the guided-missile frigate departed Subic Bay for Vietnamese waters on 3 March. She entered port at Danang, South Vietnam, on 5 March and, the following day, was on her way for a PIRAZ (Positive Identification Radar Advisory Zone) station. For the next four months, &quot;Biddle&quot; alternated between periods at sea—either carrying out PIRAZ duty, serving as an antiair warfare (AAW) picket, or acting as a sea-air rescue (SAR) vessel—with time in port at Subic Bay or Yokosuka, Japan.

On 14 July, the warship completed her final tour of duty off the coast of Vietnam. She returned to Subic Bay for the period 16 to 19 July and then got underway for the voyage home. During the voyage, she completed a circumnavigation of the world and visited such diverse places as Singapore, Lourenco Marques (now Maputo) in Mozambique, the Cape Verde Islands, Lisbon in Portugal, and Copenhagen in Denmark. The warship arrived back in Norfolk on 12 September and remained in port until mid-November. On the 15th, &quot;Biddle&quot; got underway for missile exercises in the West Indies. She returned to Norfolk on 25 November and remained there through the end of the year.

On 13 January 1969, she got underway from Norfolk bound for Philadelphia. The warship spent five days there for fire fighting and damage control training, returning to Norfolk on 20 January. &quot;Biddle&quot;″s sojourn at Norfolk lasted until 28 March when she put to sea, bound for the Caribbean. While there, the warship conducted tests on recent modifications to her radar and made six missile shoots. Returning to the Hampton Roads area, she loaded missiles, torpedoes, and ammunition at Yorktown, Virginia, on 30 April before reentering Norfolk on 1 May.

On 26 May, &quot;Biddle&quot; departed Norfolk on her way to the western Pacific. She transited the Panama Canal on 31 May and 1 June and then set a course for Hawaii. The guided-missile frigate stopped at Pearl Harbor from 10 to 12 June before resuming her voyage. She made a brief stop at Guam for fuel on the 20th and arrived in Subic Bay on 24 June. After a four-day stop, &quot;Biddle&quot; stood out of Subic Bay on her way to South Vietnam. The warship made a brief stop at Danang on 30 June before relieving the cruiser on 1 July as strike-support and search-and-rescue ship. The guided-missile frigate kept watch off the Vietnamese coast for the next month. The only event of note occurred near the end of the month when she rescued several North Vietnamese fishermen adrift in their boat.

Relieved by &quot;Chicago&quot; on 1 August, &quot;Biddle&quot; dropped the fishermen off at Danang and then headed for the Philippines. The warship spent a week at Subic Bay and three days at Manila before heading back to Vietnam on 13 August. On 15 August, she relieved &quot;Chicago&quot; on station in the Gulf of Tonkin. She served as strike-support and search-and-rescue ship until 22 August when she relieved &quot;Chicago&quot; as PIRAZ (Positive Identification Radar Advisory Zone) ship. The warship alternated between those two tasks until 10 September when she was relieved on PIRAZ station by the destroyer . The guided-missile frigate entered Yokosuka, Japan on 14 September, after a brief stop at Subic Bay to disembark her helicopter detachment.

&quot;Biddle&quot; completed a two-week tender availability on 27 September and departed Yokosuka for the combat zone. Steaming by way of Subic Bay, she arrived back on Yankee Station on 2 October. Between the 2d and the 6th, Commander, Destroyer Squadron (ComDesRon) 3, rode in &quot;Biddle&quot; and served as antiair warfare coordinator for Task Force (TF) 77. On the 6th, the warship resumed PIRAZ duty, relieving &quot;Jouett&quot;. For almost a month, she operated alternately as PIRAZ ship and as strike-support and search-and-rescue ship. Relieved by the cruiser on 27 October, &quot;Biddle&quot; put into Hong Kong on 29 October for a six-day liberty call. The guided-missile frigate departed Hong Kong on 4 November, made a fuel stop at Subic Bay, and then headed back to Vietnam.

She arrived back in the Gulf of Tonkin on 7 November and spent the next six days serving as plane guard for the aircraft carrier . On 13 November, the warship cleared Vietnamese waters. She stopped at Subic Bay from 15 to 18 November and then embarked on the long voyage home. After a brief fuel stop at Guam and a three-day liberty call at San Francisco, California, &quot;Biddle&quot; arrived in the Canal Zone on 16 December. She completed the canal transit on the 17th and shaped a course for Norfolk. Upon her arrival in Norfolk on 21 December, her crew began a combination post-deployment and holiday standdown.

===1970–1971===
&quot;Biddle&quot; spent the first three months of 1970 in port at Norfolk. During that period, she underwent several inspections and received modifications to some of her equipment, notably to her radar. On 13 April, the guided-missile frigate stood out of Norfolk on a five-week cruise to the Caribbean for training and for technical evaluation of her new and modified radar equipment. She returned to Norfolk on 5 June and remained in the area until the end of July getting ready for her first regular overhaul. She entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 31 July and spent the remainder of 1970 undergoing overhaul.

The guided-missile frigate completed overhaul in mid-January 1971. On 19 January, she got underway for post-repair trials in the Virginia Capes operating area and returned to port the following day. For the next four months, &quot;Biddle&quot; spent most of her time in port at Norfolk, getting underway infrequently for brief drill sessions in the immediate vicinity. On 1 June, she departed Norfolk for two months of refresher training in the West Indies. The warship reentered Norfolk on 1 August. For the remainder of the year, &quot;Biddle&quot; operated out of Norfolk conducting training missions and technical evaluations on equipment. The most notable training mission came late in September when she joined several other Navy ships, a Canadian ship, and a Dutch ship in a NATO seapower review.

===1972–1973===
The warship began 1972 with several more periods of technical evaluations at sea in January and February. In March, she entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard to be modified to carry a LAMPS (Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System) helicopter. That work came to a conclusion early in April; and, on 12 April, &quot;Biddle&quot; departed Norfolk on her way back to southeast Asia. Along the way, she transited the Panama Canal and visited Pearl Harbor and Guam before arriving in Subic Bay on 11 May. On 14 May, the warship put to sea for the combat zone. She entered the zone on 15 May and, the following day, relieved the destroyer on the northern Search and Rescue (SAR) station. &quot;Biddle&quot; spent over a month on station operating as a SAR picket and directing antiair warfare before returning to Subic Bay on 26 June.

On Independence Day, the warship got underway for her second tour of duty off Vietnam. After a week on the northern SAR station, she relieved &quot;Sterett&quot; again on 13 July, but this time as PIRAZ ship. On the night of 19 July, five MiGs attacked &quot;Biddle&quot; in two raids. In the first raid, the guided-missile frigate&#x27;s Terrier missiles destroyed one of the intruders. She claimed a possible kill in the second raid and credited it to her gun batteries. The warship drove off the remaining attackers and suffered no damage herself.

&quot;Biddle&quot; remained on station serving as either SAR picket or PIRAZ ship until early in August. She visited Hong Kong from 12 to 15 August and was in Subic Bay from 17 to 20 August. The guided-missile frigate returned to duty on the northern SAR station on 22 August. Thereafter, she again alternated between SAR and PIRAZ assignments until mid-September. Long Beach relieved her for the last time on 17 September, and &quot;Biddle&quot; unloaded equipment at Subic Bay between 20 and 24 September. On 24 September, she began the long voyage back to Norfolk. Following stops at Guam, Pearl Harbor, and San Diego, she transited the Panama Canal on 22 October and arrived back at Norfolk on 26 October to close out the year in port.

Throughout 1973 and the first five months of 1974, &quot;Biddle&quot; operated out of Norfolk conducting training missions and technical evaluations. During those operations, she visited not only waters of the western Atlantic but also those of the West Indies and the Caribbean Sea. Late in the fall of 1973, the warship participated in a joint exercise with other elements of the Atlantic Fleet and with ships of the Canadian Navy.

===1974===
On 14 June 1974, &quot;Biddle&quot; stood out of Norfolk on her way to the Mediterranean Sea. She arrived in Rota, Spain, on 24 June and relieved the destroyer . On 26 June, the warship departed Rota and entered the Mediterranean in company with Task Group (TG) 60.2. After about a month of 6th Fleet operations and port visits, &quot;Biddle&quot; was dispatched to waters adjacent to Cyprus on 22 July to join in special operations. On 1 August, the warship received orders to the area north of Crete and later operated to the west of that island. On 19 August, the United States ambassador to Cyprus was assassinated; soon thereafter, &quot;Biddle&quot; joined a special task group off the island to assist in the event of an evacuation of American citizens.

That eventuality did not come to pass, and the special task group was dissolved on 23 August. The guided-missile frigate then headed for Naples, Italy, where she arrived on 24 August. During the short voyage to Naples the ship was steaming at flank speed, which required the two boiler rooms to be &quot;split&quot;, with the forward boiler feeding steam to the forward engine room and the after boiler feeding steam to the after engine room. The forward engine room powered the port propeller. The main feed pump in the forward engine room failed catastrophically, which caused the port propeller to suddenly stop. The ship, still at flank speed from the starboard propeller, turned so sharply to port that seawater sprayed from the ship entered the ship&#x27;s ventilators. There were no serious injuries to the crew. &quot;Biddle&quot; remained at Naples until 5 September 1974 at which time she resumed operations the eastern Mediterranean. Between 8 and 10 September, the warship joined in the unsuccessful search for survivors from a TWA Boeing 707 that had crashed in the Ionian Sea. Following that mission, she resumed her schedule of 6th Fleet operations and port visits. After five days at Civitavecchia, Italy, for liberty in Rome, &quot;Biddle&quot; got underway for the eastern Mediterranean and a transit of the Straits of Bosporus and the Dardanelles. She operated in the Black Sea for five days and retransited the Straits on 11 September. Training exercises and port visits kept her busy until early December. She completed turnover procedures at Rota on 5 December and then put to sea to return to the United States. &quot;Biddle&quot; arrived back in Norfolk on 14 December and remained in port for the rest of the year.

===1975–1976===
The warship spent the first three months of 1975 at various locations around Hampton Roads preparing for an extended overhaul. On 15 April, she got underway for Bath, Maine, arriving there on the 18th. The overhaul began immediately and lasted through the end of 1975 and into 1976. On 30 June 1975, &quot;Biddle&quot; was reclassified a guided-missile cruiser and redesignated CG-34. On 15 March 1976, &quot;Biddle&quot; got underway for Bayonne, New Jersey, where she arrived on 17 March. At Bayonne, she continued her overhaul in drydock. On 24 April, the guided-missile cruiser left the drydock and, after some tests, headed south to Norfolk. She arrived at Yorktown on the 26th and began loading ordnance. Two days later, the warship reentered Norfolk. During the ensuing four months, &quot;Biddle&quot; conducted post-overhaul tests, drills, and refresher training along the east coast and in the West Indies.

On 3 September, the guided-missile cruiser departed Norfolk and headed for the waters of northern Europe and the Baltic Sea. She arrived in Scapa Flow, the British naval base in the Orkney Islands located north of Scotland, on 14 September. After a series of amphibious exercises in Norwegian waters, the warship visited Copenhagen, Denmark, from 25 to 28 September. On the latter day, she departed Copenhagen for a further series of multi-national exercises in the Baltic Sea. At the end of those maneuvers, &quot;Biddle&quot; made port visits at Hamburg in Germany, Antwerp in Belgium, and Cherbourg in France before getting underway for home on 29 October. She arrived back in Norfolk on 9 November and, except for a brief underway period on 18 and 19 November, remained in port for the rest of 1976.

===1977–1980===

During the first six months of 1977, &quot;Biddle&quot; operated out of Norfolk along the eastern seaboard and in the West Indies. Those operations included various drills and exercises as well as evolutions with warships of NATO nations and South American countries. On 11 July, she stood out of Norfolk on her way to join the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. That deployment brought visits to ports throughout the Mediterranean basin and a variety of training missions, often conducted in company with units of Allied and friendly navies. She completed the cruise on 22 December when she arrived back in Norfolk.

Over the first nine months of 1978, &quot;Biddle&quot; operated out of Norfolk. While in port, she underwent a series of inspections and examinations for the purpose of assessing various aspects of the ship&#x27;s operation. At sea, the warship ranged from the New England coast south to the West Indies participating in multiship exercises, conducting independent ship&#x27;s drills, and making missile and gun shoots. On 3 October, &quot;Biddle&quot; exited Chesapeake Bay and embarked upon the third Mediterranean deployment of her career. She arrived in Lisbon Portugal, on 14 October and relieved the cruiser . On 18 October, the guided-missile cruiser left Lisbon with units of TG 60.2 and entered the Mediterranean.

After about a month of 6th Fleet operations and port visits, &quot;Biddle&quot; transited the Straits of the Bosporus and the Dardanelles and entered the Black Sea once again. On 22 November, she entered port at Constanta, Romania, to begin what was characterized as a highly successful goodwill visit. The guided-missile cruiser departed Constanta on 27 November and completed her retransit of the Straits on 28 November. She resumed normal 6th Fleet operations, conducting multiship drills and exercises and making goodwill visits to ports in the Mediterranean. That employment carried her into March 1979. She completed turnover procedures between 23 and 25 March and then began the voyage home. The warship arrived in Norfolk on 5 April and spent the rest of the month in post-deployment standdown.

&quot;Biddle&quot; resumed 2d Fleet operations in May. Over the next three months, she put to sea a number of times to train Naval Academy and NROTC midshipmen. Early in August, she participated in a joint Navy/Air Force electronics warfare exercise. The latter part of the month, she spent at sea taking part in simulated war exercises. Upon her return to Norfolk, &quot;Biddle&quot; began preparations for her regular overhaul. On 24 September, the guided-missile cruiser departed Norfolk and shaped a course for Philadelphia. She arrived at her destination on 25 September and, three days later, entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard to commence her extended repair period. The overhaul lasted more than a year, taking up the remainder of 1979 and apparently all of 1980.

===1981–1983===

January 1981 found &quot;Biddle&quot; conducting post-overhaul shakedown. On 4 February, she stood out of Chesapeake Bay on her way to refresher training in the West Indies. The guided-missile cruiser completed refresher training on 6 April and reentered Hampton Roads on 14 April. During the following three months, &quot;Biddle&quot; operated out of her home port both in the Virginia Capes operating area and in the West Indies. On 4 August, the warship put to sea for another tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. She passed through the Strait of Gibraltar on 11 August. Between 17 and 20 August, she was part of the task group that conducted freedom-of-navigation operations in the Gulf of Sidra off the Libyan coast in defiance of the Libyan leader, Col. Muamar Qaddafi, who claimed sovereignty over the area. During that operation, Soviet-built Libyan Sukhoi Su-7 interceptors fired on American naval aircraft. In response F-14s from the aircraft carrier shot down two of the attackers. Later that month, &quot;Biddle&quot; entered the Black Sea for the third time.

Back in the Mediterranean on 4 September, she resumed normal 6th Fleet operations—multiship exercises and port visits. In mid-October she joined a contingency force off the northern coast of Egypt in the wake of the assassination of President Anwar Sadat. The destroyer relieved her on 23 October and, after a stop at Rota from 27 to 29 October, &quot;Biddle&quot; headed home. She arrived back in Norfolk on 8 November and, except for two brief periods at sea early in December, remained in port for the rest of the year.

The first five months of 1982 brought a return to normal operations along the east coast and in the West Indies. On 8 June, the warship embarked upon another deployment to the 6th Fleet. &quot;Biddle&quot; changed operational control to the 6th Fleet on 18 June. By mid-July, she was on PIRAZ station in the eastern Mediterranean with the contingency force supporting Marine Corps troops ashore in Lebanon. The guided-missile cruiser departed the area in company with the frigate . After crossing the Aegean Sea and transiting the Straits of the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, the two warships entered the Black Sea on 1 August. They completed their Black Sea operations on 5 August and anchored at Istanbul for a four-day port visit.
On 9 August 1982, &quot;Biddle&quot; and her colleagues headed back to the contingency force off Lebanon. Between 21 and 28 August, she served as escort for Palestinian Liberation Organization refugees leaving Beirut for Tunisia on board the Cypriot merchantman SS . Port visits and exercises occupied her time until mid-September when the situation in Lebanon began to break down again. &quot;Biddle&quot; returned to PIRAZ station on 18 September and remained there until 23 November. After a visit to Athens, she moved west to rendezvous with &quot;Nimitz&quot; for another freedom of navigation operation in the Gulf of Sidra. &quot;Biddle&quot; then set out for home early in December and reached Norfolk on the 22nd.

The guided-missile cruiser completed post-deployment standdown in mid-January 1983 and resumed operations out of her home port. During the first five months of the year, &quot;Biddle&quot; operated along the east coast and in the West Indies. On 26 May, the warship put to sea for NATO Exercise &quot;United Effort/ Ocean Safari 83.&quot; At the conclusion of that exercise, she commenced a series of port visits alternated with operations in the Baltic Sea. After leaving the Baltic on 7 July, &quot;Biddle&quot; visited Leith, Scotland, and participated in a joint British-American exercise. Following another four-day visit to Leith, she got underway for home on 26 July. The guided-missile cruiser arrived back in Norfolk on 5 August and resumed normal east coast operations. That employment lasted until 14 October when she began a selected restricted availability at the Norfolk Shipbuilding Co. Those repairs occupied her time for the remainder of 1983.

===1985–1986===
In October 1985, &quot;Biddle&quot; deployed for the Mediterranean with the battle group. In November as planned, she detached from the &quot;Coral Sea&quot; battle group and joined the aircraft carrier for a transit through the Suez Canal into the Indian Ocean for the bulk of operations in the North Arabian Sea. The battle group crossed the equator on 10 December 1985 and participating crewmembers became &quot;Shellbacks.&quot; During a port visit in early January 1986 at Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory, the battle group was informed that they needed to get underway on very short notice. Included with replenishment supplies was a videotape of President Reagan&#x27;s address to the nation blaming Libyan President Muammar al-Gaddafi for connections with Christmas Day airport bombings in Europe. Both &quot;Saratoga&quot; and &quot;Coral Sea&quot; were integrated into one carrier battle group.

Three patrols near the &quot;Line of Death&quot; marked in the Gulf of Sidra were largely unremarkable. The fourth patrol resulted in three Libyan patrol boats being attacked and sunk. Just prior, the aircraft carrier joined the now 3 carrier battle group, with RADM Jeremy &quot;Mike&quot; Boorda commanding the group. &quot;Biddle&quot; had an opportunity to fire a Harpoon missile, but due to the proximity of other American ships, no attempt was made. For this action against Libya, the battle group was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation. For the most part, &quot;Biddle&quot; was far from action, instead being primary picket ship for &quot;Coral Sea&quot;.

&quot;Saratoga&quot; detached and was replaced by . &quot;Coral Sea&quot; and her escorts were enjoying what was to be her last port visit prior to leaving the Mediterranean. As the ships left port, it was quickly noticed that the ships were heading in the wrong direction. The 5th patrol off Libya now included Operation El Dorado Canyon, the aerial attacks on Tripoli and terrorist camps near Benghazi. Participating units were awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. There was an uneventful 6th patrol. &quot;Biddle&quot; arrived home to much fanfare at Norfolk, Virginia on Armed Forces Day, May 1986. For the entire period, &quot;Biddle&quot; and other participating units were awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal. Since most of the crew earned two different expeditionary medals, they were forced to choose which one to accept.

===1986–1988===
In July, &quot;Biddle&quot; made her way to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for overhaul. In addition, she would be the first ship to be converted to the New Threat Upgrade, a package to add new weapons technology to older guided missile destroyers and guided missile cruisers. The centerpiece would be the added capability of the Standard Missile 2 – Extended Range system, which added a solid rocket booster to the Medium Range missile and extending maximum range from about to over . Other radar, sonar and electronics upgrades were installed. Most notably, the forward superstructure was changed to accommodate many of the improvements, also changing the look of the ship. During the second half of 1987 and the first half of 1988, &quot;Biddle&quot; made numerous trips off Wallops Island, Virginia and the Caribbean to test the new technology, accomplishing many firsts along the way.

==Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm==

USS &quot;Biddle&quot; was deployed to the Middle East in September 1990 as part of Operation Desert Shield, where she joined the battle group at the Red Sea. On 12 September she diverted the first merchant ship of the operation. By 4 December, she had made a total of 27 boardings and four diversions, when on that date she suffered a major maneuver casualty when inexplicably her rudder broke off her rudder post and sank to the bottom of the Red Sea. The US Navy flew a replacement rudder, via USAF C-5B aircraft to Toulon, France, where repairs were effected at the French Naval Shipyard. After spending Christmas at Toulon, France, &quot;Biddle&quot; rejoined the operations, this time to provide antiaircraft support for the two US battle groups on station in the northern Red Sea. By the beginning of Desert Storm the cruiser had boarded 30 freighters. At the end of hostilities, &quot;Biddle&quot; made another six boardings, and was the only warship to seize a merchant in the war. She left the Red Sea with the highest percentage of diversions of any coalition vessel, with 22.2 percent of her boardings ending with diversions for further inspection.

==Fate==

The cruiser was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 November 1993 and sold for scrap to Metro Marine Corporation of Philadelphia on 4 December 2000.

<doc id="532376" wikidata="Q2629503" url="?curid=532376" title="Supreme Court of California">
<text>The Supreme Court of California is the highest and final court of appeals in the courts of the U.S. state of California. It is headquartered in San Francisco at the Earl Warren Building, but it regularly holds sessions in Los Angeles and Sacramento. Its decisions are binding on all other California state courts. Since 1850, the court has issued many influential decisions in a variety of areas including torts, property, civil and constitutional rights, and criminal law.

==Composition==
Under the original 1849 California Constitution, the Court started with a chief justice and two associate justices. The Court was expanded to five justices in 1862. Under the current 1879 constitution, the Court expanded to six associate justices and one chief justice, for the current total of seven. The justices are appointed by the Governor of California and are subject to retention elections.

According to the California Constitution, to be considered for appointment, as with any California judge, a person must be an attorney admitted to practice in California or have served as a judge of a California court for 10 years immediately preceding the appointment.

To fill a vacant position, the Governor must first submit a candidate&#x27;s name to the Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation of the State Bar of California, which prepares and returns a thorough, confidential evaluation of the candidate. Next, the Governor officially nominates the candidate, who must then be evaluated by the Commission on Judicial Appointments, which consists of the Chief Justice of California, the Attorney General of California, and a senior presiding justice of the California Courts of Appeal. The Commission holds a public hearing and if satisfied with the nominee&#x27;s qualifications, confirms the nomination. The nominee can then immediately fill an existing vacancy, or replace a departing justice at the beginning of the next judicial term.

If a nominee is confirmed to fill a vacancy that arose partway through a judicial term, the justice must stand for retention during the next gubernatorial election. Voters then determine whether to retain the justice for the remainder of the judicial term. At the term&#x27;s conclusion, justices must again undergo a statewide retention election for a full 12-year term. If a majority votes &quot;no&quot;, the seat becomes vacant and may be filled by the Governor.

The electorate has occasionally exercised the power not to retain justices. Chief Justice Rose Bird and Associate Justices Cruz Reynoso and Joseph Grodin were staunchly opposed to capital punishment and were subsequently removed in the 1986 general election. Newly reelected Governor George Deukmejian was then able to elevate Associate Justice Malcolm M. Lucas to Chief Justice and appoint three new associate justices (one to replace Lucas in his old post and two to replace Reynoso and Grodin). 
===Structure===

Between 1879 and 1966, the court was divided by the state constitution into two three-justice panels, Department One and Department Two. The chief justice divided cases evenly between the panels and also decided which cases would be heard &quot;in bank&quot; (en banc) by the Court sitting as a whole. During the late 1920s, the court gradually transitioned to routinely hearing all appeals in bank, apart from two unusual exceptions in 1941 when it again tried to sit in departments. The 1966 formal abolition of the department system merely confirmed how the court had been actually operating for quite some time. 
 Oral argument was mandatory only for in bank hearings of appeals, which meant that many appeals were decided by three-justice departments on the briefs alone. However, the state constitution required department decisions to be unanimous to produce a final judgment. Any dissent automatically triggered an in bank hearing. After a constitutional amendment in 1966, the Court currently sits in bank (all seven together) when hearing all appeals. When there is an open seat on the court, or if a justice recuses himself or herself on a given case, justices from the California Courts of Appeal are assigned by the chief justice to join the court for individual cases on a rotational basis.

The procedure for when all justices recuse themselves from a case has varied over time. For a 1992 case, the chief justice requested the presiding justice of a Court of Appeal district (different from the one where the case originated) to select six other Court of Appeal justices from his district, and they formed an acting Supreme Court for the purpose of deciding that one case. However, in a later case where all members of the Court recused themselves when Governor Schwarzenegger sought a writ of mandate (&quot;Schwarzenegger v. Court of Appeal (Epstein)&quot;), seven justices of the Courts of Appeal were selected based on the regular rotational basis, not from the same district, with the most senior one serving as the acting chief justice, and that acting supreme court eventually denied the writ petition. In a yet more recent case (&quot;Mallano v. Chiang&quot;) where all members of the Court recused themselves on a petition for review by retired Court of Appeal justices on a matter involving those justices&#x27; salaries (that apparently involved matters up to and including the 2016–2017 fiscal year), the Court ordered that six superior court judges be selected from the pool that took office after July 1, 2017, to serve as the substitute justices for the six sitting justices, with the senior judge among that group serving as the acting Chief Justice; that acting Supreme Court eventually denied the petition for review.

===Membership===

Six current justices were appointed by Democrats (Liu, Kruger, Groban, Jenkins, Guerrero and Evans) and one by Republicans (Corrigan).

There are three African American (Kruger, Jenkins, Evans) justices, one East Asian American justice (Liu), two non-Hispanic white justices (Corrigan, Groban) and one Latina (Guerrero). One justice earned an undergraduate degree from a University of California school (Guerrero at Berkeley), five from private universities in California (Corrigan at Holy Names, Liu, Groban and Evans at Stanford, and Jenkins at Santa Clara), and one from an out-of-state private university (Kruger at Harvard). Two justices earned their law degrees from a University of California law school (Corrigan at UC Law SF and Evans at Davis), two from a private California university (Guerrero at Stanford and Jenkins at the University of San Francisco), and three from law schools at out-of-state private universities (Liu and Kruger at Yale, and Groban at Harvard).

The most recent addition to the court is Associate Justice Kelli Evans, who was sworn in on January 2, 2023, to replace then-Associate Justice Patricia Guerrero, who was elevated to chief justice. In 2023, Guerrero became the first Latina to serve as chief justice.

The court first had a female majority from 2011 to 2017. This majority had been achieved in 2011 after Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appointed Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye to the court, joining Justice Joyce L. Kennard (an appointee of Republican Governor George Deukmejian), Justice Kathryn Werdegar (appointed by Republican Governor Pete Wilson), and Justice Carol A. Corrigan (another Schwarzenegger appointee). When Kennard retired in 2014, Democratic Governor Jerry Brown preserved the female majority by appointing Leondra Kruger to succeed her; while this first female majority later ended with the 2017 retirement of Werdegar and appointment of Groban by Brown to succeed her, a second female majority was later established in 2022, upon the swearing-in of Guerrero to replace Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar.

==Operation==
===Jurisdiction===
The Constitution of California gives the Court mandatory and exclusive appellate jurisdiction in all cases imposing capital punishment in California, although the Court has sponsored a state constitutional amendment to allow it to assign death penalty appeals to the California Courts of Appeal. The Court has discretionary appellate jurisdiction over all cases reviewed by the Courts of Appeal; the latter were created by a 1904 constitutional amendment to relieve the Supreme Court of most of its workload so the Court could then focus on dealing with non-frivolous appeals that involved important issues of law.

According to research by Justice Goodwin Liu, each year the Court has averaged 5,200 petitions for writs of certiorari and 3,400 petitions for habeas corpus, plus 40 additional petitions from inmates already on death row. In an average year the Court will decide to hear 83 cases and will be required to hear appeals from 20 new inmates joining death row. Each week, the Court votes on 150 to 300 petitions, paying special attention to a staff-recommended &quot;A list&quot; as well as to certified questions from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

===Internal procedure===
The Court is open for business year-round (as opposed to operating only during scheduled &quot;terms&quot; as is commonplace in jurisdictions that observe the legal year). The Court hears oral argument at least one week per month, 10 months each year (except July and August). It has been headquartered in San Francisco since 1874. Since 1878, it has regularly heard oral argument each year at San Francisco (four months), Los Angeles (four months), and Sacramento (two months).

According to Justice Liu, when a case is granted review, the Chief Justice assigns the case to a justice, who, after the parties finish briefing, then prepares a draft opinion. Each justice writes a preliminary response to the draft opinion, and if the assigned justice is in the minority, she may ask the Chief Justice to reassign the case to someone in the majority. The Court then hears oral arguments and, immediately afterwards, meet alone to vote. The California Constitution requires suspension of the justices&#x27; salaries if the Court fails to then file a decision within 90 days. The Court issues unanimous opinions in 77% of cases, compared to 43% by the Supreme Court of the United States.

Throughout the year (including July and August), the justices have a conference every Wednesday the Court is not hearing oral argument, with the exception of the last week, respectively, of November and December (Thanksgiving and New Year&#x27;s). New opinions are published online on Monday and Thursday mornings at 10 a.m. Paper copies also become available through the clerk&#x27;s office at that time.

The Court is one of the few U.S. courts apart from the U.S. Supreme Court that enjoys the privilege of having its opinions routinely published in three hardcover reporters. The Court&#x27;s Reporter of Decisions contracts with a private publisher (currently LexisNexis) to publish the official reporter, &quot;California Reports&quot;, now in its fifth series; note that the series number changes whenever the publisher changes, although the most recent changeover to the fifth series did not involve a change in reporter. West publishes California decisions in both the &quot;California Reporter&quot; (in its second series) and the &quot;Pacific Reporter&quot; (in its third series). (The New York Court of Appeals opinions are similarly published in three reporters.)

Each justice has five assigned chambers attorneys. Since the late 1980s, the Court has turned away from the traditional use of law clerks, and has switched to permanent staff attorneys. Justices Goodwin Liu and Leondra Kruger, however, have returned to the traditional use of recent law school graduates as one-year clerks for some of their staff positions. The Court has about 85 staff attorneys, some of whom are attached to particular justices; the rest are shared as a central staff. The advantage to this system is that the reduced turnover of staff attorneys (versus the traditional system of rotating through new law clerks every year) has improved the efficiency of the court in dealing with complex cases, particularly death penalty cases.

During its first half-century of operation, the Court struggled to keep up with its soaring caseload and very frequently fell behind, until the California Courts of Appeal were created in 1904. This resulted in provisions in the 1879 Constitution requiring the Court to decide all cases in writing with reasons given (to get rid of minor cases, it had often given summary dispositions with &quot;no&quot; reasons given) and requiring California judges to certify in writing every month that no matter submitted for consideration had been outstanding for more than 90 days, or else they will not be paid. To comply with the latter provision, the Court does not schedule oral argument until the justices and their staff attorneys have already studied the briefs, formulated their respective positions, and circulated draft opinions. Then, after the matter is formally &quot;argued and submitted&quot; before the Court, the justices can polish and file their opinions well before reaching the 90-day deadline. This differs sharply from the practice in all other federal and state appellate courts, where judges can schedule oral argument not long after written briefing is finished, but then may take many months (or even a year) after oral argument to file their opinions.

====Historical procedure====

In March 1885, the state legislature authorized the creation of the Supreme Court Commission to help with the Court&#x27;s overwhelming backlog of pending appeals. The justices were initially allowed to hire three commissioners. Since oral argument was not mandatory except for in bank hearings of appeals, the justices began to assign cases to the commissioners which could likely be resolved on the briefs alone. The number of commissioners was expanded in five in 1889.

In retrospect, the commissioners can be seen as an important precursor of the law clerks and staff attorneys which the Court began to hire in the 1930s. In contrast to modern practice, where appellate justices are expected to take ownership of the opinions to which they sign their names and staff members are mere ghostwriters, the commissioners openly signed their opinions. Each of the approximately 4,400 appeals (3,700 reported, 700 unreported) handled by the commissioners was resolved by an opinion signed by one commissioner with the concurrence of two others. The opinions always ended in a recommended disposition, such as: &quot;We find no error in the record and the judgment should be affirmed.&quot; Originally, this was followed by a one-line unsigned per curiam statement in the name of &quot;The Court,&quot; such as: &quot;For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment is affirmed.&quot; Starting in 1892, the three justices who reviewed and summarily adopted each commissioners&#x27; opinion began to also sign their names.

The commissioners were only partially successful in reducing the chronic backlog. The Commission was also subject to heavy criticism as an unelected &quot;auxiliary court&quot;. Attorneys who enjoyed appellate work but had difficulty holding onto judicial seats in partisan elections repeatedly bounced back and forth between serving as elected justices and unelected commissioners. After two more decades of debate, the state legislature recognized that the state needed to establish intermediate appellate courts and referred the issue to the electorate. In November 1904, Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 2 was approved by the state&#x27;s voters, which abolished the Supreme Court Commission and created the California Courts of Appeal. All five commissioners were promptly appointed in 1905 to serve among the original nine justices of the Courts of Appeal.

===Publication of opinions===

Except for one decade at its founding, the Court has never been required by constitutional or statutory law to publish all its opinions. The Court currently chooses to publish all opinions as a matter of public policy, as disclosed in rule 8.1105(a) of the California Rules of Court. The original California Constitution of 1849 authorized the Court to publish all opinions that it &quot;may deem expedient,&quot; and the current California Constitution of 1879 authorizes the Court to publish all opinions that it &quot;deems appropriate.&quot; In 1850, a statute was enacted directing the Supreme Court to publish opinions in all cases, but in 1855, the Court began to direct that some opinions should not be reported, and this procedure was retroactively approved by the legislature in an 1860 statute. Over 1,800 unreported opinions were filed by the Court over the next 25 years (which includes the 700 unreported opinions filed by the commissioners). The &quot;Pacific Reporter&quot; started to collect and publish the Court&#x27;s unreported opinions at its launch in 1883, and then the Court gave in and switched back to publication of all opinions. A small group of lawyers later recovered and compiled all the unreported opinions filed by the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court Commission before that point, which were published in a separate seven-volume reporter called &quot;California Unreported Cases&quot; starting in 1913. Despite its name, those cases are citable as precedent.

==Ancillary responsibilities==
The Court supervises the lower courts (including the trial-level California superior courts) through the Judicial Council of California and the California Commission on Judicial Performance, and also supervises California&#x27;s legal profession through the State Bar of California. All lawyer admissions are done through recommendations of the State Bar, which then must be ratified by the Supreme Court, and attorney discipline is delegated to the State Bar Court of California (although suspensions longer than three years must be independently decided upon by the Court). California&#x27;s bar is the largest in the U.S. with 210,000 members, of whom 160,000 are practicing. In 2018 and in 2023, the Court issued reform directives regarding corrupt practices within the State Bar of California.

The court, with the assistance of the Reporter of Decisions, publishes the California Style Manual for use by the California Courts of Appeal and the superior courts.

==Reputation==

As &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; stated, in 1972:

The state&#x27;s high court over the past 20 years has won a reputation as perhaps the most innovative of the state judiciaries, setting precedents in areas of criminal justice, civil liberties, racial integration, and consumer protection that heavily influence other states and the federal bench.

Statistical analyses conducted by LexisNexis personnel at the Court&#x27;s request indicate that the decisions of the Supreme Court of California are by far the most followed of any state supreme court in the United States. Between 1940 and 2005, 1,260 decisions of the Court were expressly followed by out-of-state courts (meaning that those courts expressly found the Court&#x27;s reasoning persuasive and applied it to the cases before them).

Many important legal concepts have been pioneered or developed by the Court, including strict liability for defective products, fair procedure, negligent infliction of emotional distress, palimony, insurance bad faith, wrongful life, and market-share liability.

The major film studios in and around Hollywood and the high-tech firms of Silicon Valley both fall under the Court&#x27;s jurisdiction. Thus, the Court has decided a number of cases by, between, and against such companies, as well as several cases involving Hollywood celebrities and high-tech executives.

The California Supreme Court and all lower California state courts use a different writing style and citation system from the federal courts and many other state courts. California citations have the year between the names of the parties and the reference to the case reporter, as opposed to the national standard (the Bluebook) of putting the year at the end. For example, the famous case &quot;Marvin v. Marvin&quot;, which established the standard for non-marital partners&#x27; ability to sue for their contributions to the partnership, is rendered &quot;Marvin v. Marvin&quot; (1976) 18 Cal.3d 660 [134 Cal.Rptr. 815, 557 P.2d 106] in California style, while it would be &quot;Marvin v. Marvin&quot;, 18 Cal. 3d 660, 557 P.2d 106, 134 Cal. Rptr. 815 (1976), in Bluebook style. The California citation style, however, has always been the norm of common law jurisdictions outside the United States, including England, Canada and Australia.

While the U.S. Supreme Court justices indicate the author of an opinion and who has &quot;joined&quot; the opinion at the start of the opinion, California justices always sign a majority opinion at the end, followed by &quot;WE CONCUR,&quot; and then the names of the joining justices. California judges are traditionally not supposed to use certain ungrammatical terms in their opinions, which has led to embarrassing fights between judges and the editor of the state&#x27;s official reporters. California has traditionally avoided the use of certain French and Latin phrases like &quot;en banc&quot;, &quot;certiorari&quot;, and &quot;mandamus&quot;, so California judges and attorneys use &quot;in bank,&quot; &quot;review,&quot; and &quot;mandate&quot; instead (though &quot;in bank&quot; has become quite rare after 1974).

Finally, the Court has the power to &quot;depublish&quot; opinions by the Courts of Appeal (as opposed to the federal practice of &quot;not&quot; publishing certain &quot;unpublished&quot; opinions at all in the federal case reporters). This means that even though the opinion has already been published in the official state reporters, it will be binding only upon the parties. Stare decisis does not apply, and any new rules articulated will not be applied in future cases. Similarly, the California Supreme Court has the power to &quot;publish&quot; opinions by the California Courts of Appeal which were initially not published.

==Important cases==

The California Supreme Court has handed down important and influential decisions since 1850. Some of the most significant of these important and influential Court decisions are listed below in date ascending order. Most of the Court decisions that follow were landmark decisions that were among the first such decisions in the United States or the world. 
* &quot;People v. Hall&quot; (1854): A case which held that Chinese persons may not testify against a white man, even if the white man is accused of murdering a Chinese person; effectively overturned by state law in 1873. The &quot;Hall&quot; case has been described as &quot;containing some of the most offensive racial rhetoric to be found in the annals of California appellate jurisprudence&quot; and &quot;the worst statutory interpretation case in history.&quot;
* &quot;Houston v. Williams&quot; (1859): A leading case on the separation of powers under the California Constitution.
* &quot;Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.&quot; (1944): Then-Associate Justice Roger Traynor suggested in a now-famous concurring opinion that the Court should dispose of legal fictions like warranties and impose strict liability for defective products as a matter of public policy.
* &quot;Perez v. Sharp&quot; (1948): The Court overturned the statutory ban on interracial marriage as unconstitutional. &quot;Perez&quot; directly influenced the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision on this issue, &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; (1967).
* &quot;Summers v. Tice&quot; (1948): The Court shifted the burden to the defense to disprove causation when it was clear that one of two defendants must have caused the plaintiff&#x27;s injury, but it was not clear which one.
* &quot;Dillon v. Legg&quot; (1968): The Court radically expanded the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED) beyond its traditional form, which historically had been limited to plaintiffs standing in the same &quot;zone of danger&quot; as a relative who was killed.
* &quot;Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. v. G. W. Drayage &amp; Rigging Co., Inc.&quot; (1968): The Court held that parol evidence could be conditionally received by a trial court to determine if a contract was ambiguous when not ambiguous on its face. This decision has not been followed by the courts of any other state.
* &quot;Rowland v. Christian&quot; (1968): The Court abolished the old distinctions between different types of persons entering land and imposed a general duty of care in the context of the tort of negligence.
* &quot;People v. Belous&quot; (1969): The Court held the state&#x27;s criminal statute prohibiting abortions to be unconstitutionally vague, in a 4–3 decision.
* &quot;People v. Anderson&quot; (1972): The Court relied upon the state constitutional clause prohibiting &quot;cruel or unusual punishment&quot; (note the difference from the federal Constitution&#x27;s &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; clause) to abolish capital punishment in California. The state electorate promptly overruled &quot;Anderson&quot; that same year with a popular initiative, Proposition 17, that kept the &quot;cruel or unusual&quot; clause but declared the death penalty to be neither cruel nor unusual.
* &quot;Pitchess v. Superior Court&quot; (1974): The Court held that criminal defendants have a right to access the arresting officer&#x27;s personnel file when the defendant alleges in an affidavit that the officer used excessive force or lied about the circumstances of the arrest.
* &quot;Li v. Yellow Cab Co.&quot; (1975): The Court embraced comparative negligence as part of California tort law and rejected strict contributory negligence.
* &quot;Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California&quot; (1976): The Court held that mental health professionals have a duty to protect individuals who are being threatened with bodily harm by a patient. The original 1974 decision mandated warning the threatened individual, but a 1976 rehearing resulted in a decision calling for a &quot;duty to protect&quot; the intended victim, which did not necessarily require that a potential victim be informed of the threat.
* &quot;Marvin v. Marvin&quot; (1976): The Court ruled in favor of the enforceability of non-marital relationship contracts, express or implied, to the extent that they are &quot;not&quot; founded purely upon meretricious sexual services. In other words, even though California does not recognize common law marriage, persons who cohabit for long periods of time and commingle their assets are allowed to plead and prove marriage-like contracts for support and division of property.
* &quot;Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center&quot; (1979): The Court found that the broad right to freedom of speech in the state constitution included an implied right to freedom of speech in &quot;private&quot; shopping centers. The U.S. Supreme Court in turn held that the state supreme court&#x27;s decision did not amount to a &quot;taking&quot; of the shopping center under federal constitutional law.
* &quot;Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories&quot; (1980): The Court imposed market share liability on the makers of fungible hazardous products.
* &quot;Thing v. La Chusa&quot; (1989): The Court withdrew from the expansive form of NIED set forth in &quot;Dillon&quot; and imposed a rigid bright-line test for recovery in bystander NIED cases. The &quot;Thing&quot; decision included extensive &quot;dicta&quot; hostile to plaintiffs which more generally limited the scope of recovery for both the tort of negligence and emotional distress damages in California.
* &quot;Moore v. Regents of the University of California&quot; (1990): The Court held that patients do not have intellectual property rights in profits from medical discoveries made with their body parts.
* &quot;Wendland v. Wendland&quot; (2001): The Court held that in the absence of a legally recognized method of determining who should make medical decisions on the behalf of an incompetent patient, the constitutional right to life and right to privacy granted special protection to the incompetent person.
* &quot;Yount v. City of Sacramento&quot; (2008): The Court held that a criminal conviction does not limit an individual&#x27;s right to bring civil action for deprivation of rights in cases of excessive use of force.
* &quot;In re Marriage Cases&quot; (2008): The Court held that sexual orientation is a protected class which requires strict scrutiny and under such scrutiny, laws prohibiting same-sex marriage are unconstitutional under the state constitution. The state electorate overturned the marriage portion of the decision that same year by enacting a popular initiative, Proposition 8, but left in place the discrimination protections.
* &quot;Silicon Valley Taxpayers&#x27; Assn., Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority&quot; (2008): The Court unanimously held in a Proposition 218 (&quot;Right to Vote on Taxes Act&quot;) case that courts must exercise their independent judgment in reviewing local agency legislative decisions adopting special assessments. The highly deferential standard of review before Proposition 218 became law was grounded in separation of powers. Because the constitutional provisions of Proposition 218 were of equal dignity to the separation of powers doctrine, it no longer justified allowing a local agency to usurp the judicial function of interpreting and applying the constitutional provisions that governed assessments under Proposition 218.
* &quot;People v. Diaz&quot; (2011): The Court held that the warrantless search of information in a cell phone was valid when incident to a lawful arrest. (The holding in &quot;Diaz&quot; was eventually repudiated by the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Riley v. California&quot;.)
* &quot;Dynamex v. Superior Court&quot; (2018): The Court abandoned the Control Test for the ABC Test and first ruled gig economy workers to be employees. Chief Justice Cantil-Sakauye penned this landmark decision. It led to AB5 which made it formalized and retroactive at the same time.

<text>USS &quot;Birmingham&quot; (CS-2/CL-2), named for the city of Birmingham, Alabama, was a scout cruiser, reclassified a light cruiser in 1920. Entering service in 1908, the ship became known for the first airplane takeoff from a ship in history in 1910. During World War I, &quot;Birmingham&quot; escorted convoys across the Atlantic. The cruiser was decommissioned in 1923 and sold for scrap in 1930.

==Construction and career==
The cruiser was laid down by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company at Quincy, Massachusetts, on 14 August 1905, and launched on 29 May 1907; sponsored by Miss Mary Campbell. &quot;Birmingham&quot; was commissioned on 11 April 1908, Commander Burns Tracy Walling in command.
&quot;Birmingham&quot; served with the Atlantic Fleet until 27 June 1911, and went into reserve at Boston three days later. One of her sailors, Chief Electrician William E. Snyder, received the Medal of Honor for rescuing a shipmate from drowning on 4 January 1910. From &quot;Birmingham&quot;″s deck, civilian pilot Eugene Ely made the first airplane take-off from a warship on 14 November 1910 in a Curtiss Model D biplane designed by Glenn Curtiss.

Recommissioned on 15 December 1911, she made a short cruise to the West Indies and then reverted to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia on 20 April 1912. From 19 May – 11 July, she was in commission for service on Ice Patrol and then returned to the Philadelphia Reserve Group. Recommissioned on 1 October 1913, &quot;Birmingham&quot; carried the Commissioners of the Panama–Pacific International Exposition on a South American tour from 3 October – 26 December, and was then outfitted at Philadelphia Navy Yard as a tender to the Torpedo Flotilla.

She left the yard on 2 February 1914, and resumed operations with the Atlantic Fleet as flagship of the Torpedo Flotilla. On April 20, she received orders to carry a detachment of aircraft to Tampico as part of the US occupation of Veracruz, becoming part of the first operational use of naval aircraft. On May 24, after spending a month near Tampico, she rendezvoused with the fleet at Veracruz before returning to the United States.

===World War I and fate===
Following American entrance into World War I, &quot;Birmingham&quot; patrolled along the northeast U.S. coast until 14 June 1917, when she sailed from New York as part of the escort for the first US troop convoy to France. After returning to New York she was fitted for service in Europe and in August reported to Gibraltar as flagship for Rear Admiral A. P. Niblack, Commander, US Forces Gibraltar. She escorted convoys between Gibraltar, the British Isles, and France until the Armistice. After a short cruise in the eastern Mediterranean, she returned to the United States in January 1919.

From July 1919 to May 1922, she was based at San Diego, California, as flagship of Destroyer Squadrons, Pacific Fleet, and then moved to Balboa, Canal Zone as flagship of the Special Service Squadron. After cruising along the Central American and northern South American coast, she returned to Philadelphia and was decommissioned there on 1 December 1923, being sold for scrap on 13 May 1930.

<doc id="532379" wikidata="Q252730" url="?curid=532379" title="Type species">
<text>In zoological nomenclature, a type species (species typica) is the species name with which the name of a genus or subgenus is considered to be permanently taxonomically associated, i.e., the species that contains the biological type (or specimens). A similar concept is used for suprageneric groups and called a type genus.

In botanical nomenclature, these terms have no formal standing under the code of nomenclature, but are sometimes borrowed from zoological nomenclature. In botany, the type of a genus name is a specimen (or, rarely, an illustration) which is also the type of a species name. The species name with that type can also be referred to as the type of the genus name. Names of genus and family ranks, the various subdivisions of those ranks, and some higher-rank names based on genus names, have such types.

In bacteriology, a type species is assigned for each genus. Whether or not currently recognized as valid, every named genus or subgenus in zoology is theoretically associated with a type species. In practice, however, there is a backlog of untypified names defined in older publications when it was not required to specify a type.

== Use in zoology ==

A type species is both a concept and a practical system that is used in the classification and nomenclature (naming) of animals. The &quot;type species&quot; represents the reference species and thus &quot;definition&quot; for a particular genus name. Whenever a taxon containing multiple species must be divided into more than one genus, the type species automatically assigns the name of the original taxon to one of the resulting new taxa, the one that includes the type species.

The term &quot;type species&quot; is regulated in zoological nomenclature by article 42.3 of the &quot;International Code of Zoological Nomenclature&quot;, which defines a type species as the name-bearing type of the name of a genus or subgenus (a &quot;genus-group name&quot;). In the Glossary, type species is defined as

The type species permanently attaches a formal name (the generic name) to a genus by providing just one species within that genus to which the genus name is permanently linked (i.e. the genus must include that species if it is to bear the name). The species name in turn is fixed, in theory, to a type specimen.

For example, the type species for the land snail genus &quot;Monacha&quot; is &quot;Helix cartusiana&quot;, the name under which the species was first described, known as &quot;Monacha cartusiana&quot; when placed in the genus &quot;Monacha&quot;. That genus is currently placed within the family Hygromiidae. The type genus for that family is the genus &quot;Hygromia&quot;.

The concept of the type species in zoology was introduced by Pierre André Latreille.

==Citing==
The &quot;International Code of Zoological Nomenclature&quot; states that the original name (binomen) of the type species should always be cited. It gives an example in Article 67.1. &quot;Astacus marinus&quot; was later designated as the type species of the genus &quot;Homarus&quot;, thus giving it the name &quot;Homarus marinus&quot; . However, the type species of &quot;Homarus&quot; should always be cited using its original name, i.e. &quot;Astacus marinus&quot; , even though that is a junior synonym of &quot;Cancer grammarius&quot; .

Although the &quot;International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants&quot; does not contain the same explicit statement, examples make it clear that the original name is used, so that the &quot;type species&quot; of a genus name need not have a name within that genus. Thus in Article 10, Ex. 3, the type of the genus name &quot;Elodes&quot; is quoted as the type of the species name &quot;Hypericum aegypticum&quot;, not as the type of the species name &quot;Elodes aegyptica&quot;. (&quot;Elodes&quot; is not now considered distinct from &quot;Hypericum&quot;.)

<text>USS &quot;Birmingham&quot; (CL-62) was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

She was laid down at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company of Newport News, Virginia, on 17 February 1941 and launched on 20 March 1942 by Mrs. Cooper Green, wife of the president of the Birmingham City Commission. She was commissioned on 29 January 1943, Captain John Wilkes in command. &quot;Birmingham&quot; earned eight battle stars, receiving heavy damage on at least three occasions.

==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Birmingham&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-eight Bofors guns in four quadruple and six double mounts and twenty-one Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Birmingham&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==
&quot;Birmingham&quot; was laid down at the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company at Newport News, Virginia on 17 February 1941. The completed hull was launched on 20 March 1942. Fitting-out work was completed less than a year later, by which time she had been moved to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, and she was commissioned there on 29 January 1943. Captain John E. Wilkes served as the ship&#x27;s first commander. On 20 February, &quot;Birmingham&quot; embarked on her shakedown cruise in the Chesapeake Bay, which also included gunnery tests to confirm the structural integrity of her main battery turrets, practice launching and recovering her seaplanes, and shooting practice for her gun crews. On 19 March, the ship sailed for Annapolis, Maryland, to be inspected, before returning to Norfolk on 3 April for repairs. Another round of initial training followed in the Chesapeake from 23 April, including night firing practice, refueling at sea, and fighter director exercises. In late May, she returned to Norfolk for additional repairs, before departing on 8 June for the Mediterranean Sea to join forces then engaged in the Mediterranean Theater.

===World War II===

====European Theater====
&quot;Birmingham&quot; reached Mers El Kébir in French Algeria on 22 June, where she made preparations to join the invasion fleet that was to conduct Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily. She was assigned to Task Group (TG) 86.1, along with the light cruiser and the destroyers and , which sortied on 29 June. The ships escorted part of the invasion force, which arrived off the landing beaches on the morning of 9 July. TG 86.1 helped guide the landing ships to their designated beaches, after which &quot;Birmingham&quot; shifted to shore bombardment to cover their approach. She launched two of her seaplanes to help spot the fall of shot and search for Axis artillery batteries.

During operations off the invasion beaches, &quot;Birmingham&quot; was escorted by &quot;Ludlow&quot; and the destroyer . Poor visibility hampered the cruiser&#x27;s gunners, and her aircraft were repeatedly engaged by friendly forces that mistook them for hostile planes. At 07:15, one of the aircraft returned to &quot;Birmingham&quot;, having been badly damaged by friendly ground fire and a German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter, and half an hour later, the second seaplane withdrew as well, having nearly been shot down by a pair of British Bell P-39 Airacobra fighters. At 09:18, &quot;Birmingham&quot; checked her fire, as Allied ground forces had achieved their initial objectives by that time. The ship continued to operate off the Sicilian coast for the next nine days, providing fire support to ground forces as they fought their way inland, and protecting minesweepers as they cleared Axis mines from the area.

&quot;Birmingham&quot; left the waters off Sicily on 21 July to refuel at Bizerte in French Tunisia; she thereafter sailed to Algiers in French Algeria before moving on to Mers El Kébir. On 27 July, she departed for the United States, arriving in Norfolk on 8 August, where she underwent repairs that lasted for ten days. From there, she sailed to join the forces engaged with Japan in the Pacific Ocean. She passed through the Panama Canal on 22 August and reached Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on 5 September.

====Pacific Theater====
After arriving in Pearl Harbor, &quot;Birmingham&quot; was assigned to TG 15.1 as part of the escort for the aircraft carrier and the light carriers and . The unit sortied on 11 September to launch a raid on Japanese positions at Tarawa and Makin, returning to Pearl Harbor on 23 September. After refueling and rearming, they sortied again on 29 September to attack Wake Island. &quot;Birmingham&quot; was detached from the carrier group on 5 October to carry out shore bombardments of the island, targeting coastal batteries and storage dumps. Her spotter aircraft came under attack by a Mitsubishi A6M Zero, but the spotter was only hit by two bullets from the Zero before it escaped. TG 15.1 left the area on 6 October and arrived back in Pearl Harbor five days later.

=====Solomon Islands operations=====
&quot;Birmingham&quot; was reassigned to the Solomon Islands campaign, and she got underway on 21 October to join the naval forces operating there. She reached Espiritu Santo on 4 November, and the next day joined the escort for a convoy of six transport ships headed to Bougainville; two other light cruisers and four destroyers comprised the rest of the escort group. The group safely arrived in Empress Augusta Bay on the morning of 8 November and while they were unloading their cargoes, &quot;Birmingham&quot; and the other escorts patrolled to the southwest of the bay. Throughout the afternoon and early evening, &quot;Birmingham&quot; and her sister ship detected a total of thirteen Japanese aircraft in the distance, but none of them attacked the Allied flotilla during this period. At around 18:30, a Japanese Mitsubishi G4M medium bomber closed with the American ships. At the same time, the air-search radars on the American cruisers picked up a large attack force incoming, at a distance of about .

&quot;Birmingham&quot; and the other two cruisers opened fire with their main batteries at 19:11, at a range of , to try to disrupt the incoming aerial attack. As the Japanese aircraft closed in the darkness, the American ships launched flares to illuminate the planes. &quot;Birmingham&quot; engaged an Aichi D3A Val that was approaching the ship and inflicted fatal damage with her 20 mm and 40 mm guns, though not before the Val released its bomb. It skipped on the water and struck &quot;Birmingham&quot;″s hull on the starboard quarter; the explosion tore a hole in the hull that was wide and destroyed her aircraft hangar. Almost immediately after, another aircraft hit &quot;Birmingham&quot; with a torpedo on her port bow, blowing a hole and causing significant damage to the hull structure. Two of her fuel oil storage compartments were also flooded. The ship&#x27;s damage control teams quickly moved to contain the flooding and suppress fires from both hits, but a second Val made an attack run at &quot;Birmingham&quot;. The anti-aircraft gunners destroyed the plane as it dove on &quot;Birmingham&quot;, but its bomb nevertheless struck turret #4. The mount and all three gun barrels were damaged in the blast. In total, the three attacks killed two men and wounded another thirty-two.

&quot;Birmingham&quot; was still able to steam at and maintain her position in the formation. Further Japanese attacks occurred throughout the night, but the ships&#x27; 5-inch guns kept the aircraft at bay. At 19:58, &quot;Birmingham&quot; shot down a G4M that was dropping flares over the formation, and later that night her 5-inch guns destroyed another G4M at a range of . &quot;Birmingham&quot; withdrew without further damage, and reached the central Solomons by the morning; from there, the ships sailed on to Florida Island on 10 November. There, the ship received temporary repairs to shore up the damaged bulkheads. A vent for the flooded compartments in the bow was also created to reduce pressure on the forward bulkheads, and while steaming back to the United States, it created periodic geysers of water, which earned the ship the nickname &quot;Old Faithful&quot;. &quot;Birmingham&quot; left Florida on 16 November for Espiritu Santo, though she stayed there only briefly before continuing on to Hawaii, which she reached on 1 December.

=====Repairs and training=====
The ship was dry docked in Pearl Harbor for repairs to her hull, and on 18 December she departed for the Mare Island Navy Yard in San Francisco, California, arriving there four days later. There, she underwent permanent repairs, including six new 6-inch guns and new aircraft catapults. On 7 February 1944, while she was being moved in the harbor, &quot;Birmingham&quot; accidentally collided with the merchant vessel , and had her bow damaged again. Further repairs were necessitated, which lasted about a week. She thereafter conducted a short shakedown cruise before sailing from Mare Island on 18 February to return to Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 23 February. The ship thereafter took part in training exercises off Kahoolawe in the Hawaiian islands before leaving Hawaii on 5 March. She sailed next to the Ellice Islands, refueling at Funafuti on 10 March, before continuing on to the Solomons. She arrived in Purvis Bay there four days later, where she was assigned to Task Group 53.1.

&quot;Birmingham&quot; spent the next two months conducting training exercises in preparation for upcoming amphibious invasions planned for the Marianas Islands. These exercises included shore bombardment practice and coordination practice between shore-based fire control teams and the ship&#x27;s gunners, along with bombardments of Japanese positions on the Shortland Islands in company with her sisters and and four destroyers. During this action, she engaged in a gunnery duel with shore batteries on the island. On 24 May, she took part in a large-scale simulated amphibious invasion on Guadalcanal, which included live-fire practice in Kula Gulf. On 3 June, the ship returned to Purvis Bay, by which time some fifty men aboard the vessel were suffering from bacillary dysentery. As a result, the ship&#x27;s medical team fumigated the ship to kill disease-carrying insects. The next day, she sortied as part of the escort for a convoy of transports and Landing Ships, Tank bound for the Marshall Islands, which were being used as the staging ground for the upcoming invasion of the Marianas. Dysentary continued to spread among the crew, and by 10 June, a total of 244 men had been infected. She nevertheless sailed that day as part of the invasion fleet.

=====Mariana and Palau Islands campaign=====

&quot;Birmingham&quot; was transferred to TG 52.17, which arrived off Saipan on 14 June for the imminent invasion of Saipan; the ship protected minesweepers clearing Japanese mines off the island and covered Underwater Demolition Teams (UDT) clearing obstacles around the landing beaches. She also fired on Japanese positions in the area. The next day, &quot;Birmingham&quot; cruised off Garapan to cover UDTs on the beach and engaged Japanese coastal artillery and anti-aircraft guns in the area. She then closed to from shore, and at 08:46, she came under heavy fire from several Japanese guns. The ship received light damage to her upper works, but quickly returned fire, and over the course of the next two hours, silenced most of the guns and destroyed two ammunition dumps being used to supply them. In the course of the action, she had fired 1,345 rounds from her main battery and 1,172 shells from her secondary guns. Later in the day, she again closed with the beach to draw fire from shore guns, which were then engaged by American carrier planes.

On 16 June, &quot;Birmingham&quot; returned to the invasion beaches and joined the shore bombardment group that supported the ground forces as they went ashore. &quot;Birmingham&quot; shelled Japanese positions near an airfield as marines fought to secure it. By 09:00, her crew had begun coordinating with a ground-based fire control team, and the ship spent the rest of the day responding to fire support requests. Later that day, she was assigned to Task Unit 52.1.1, which spent the next two days bombarding Japanese positions on Saipan and neighboring Tinian. By that time, the US had received reports of a large scale Japanese counteroffensive approaching from the Philippines. &quot;Birmingham&quot; accordingly withdrew to replenish ammunition and stores from the attack cargo ship before rejoining the fleet on 17 June.

The ship joined TG 58.3, which was centered on the aircraft carrier and the light carriers &quot;Princeton&quot; and . The fleet had positioned itself some to the west of the Marianas to protect the invasion force. Japanese patrol aircraft located the American fleet on the morning of 19 June and, in the ensuing Battle of the Philippine Sea, launched a series of air strikes, but American combat air patrols intercepted most of them before they reached the fleet. After shooting down hundreds of Japanese aircraft, the American aircraft launched strikes of their own against the Japanese carriers on 20 June and inflicted further losses on the Japanese fleet, including the sinking of the carrier . The American aircraft arrived back at their carriers late in the evening and faced difficult night landings; &quot;Birmingham&quot; assisted by lighting signal smoke pots, and she also put life rafts to rescue pilots who had to ditch their aircraft at sea. The Americans pursued the retreating Japanese on 21 June, but were unable to catch them and returned to the Marianas.

&quot;Birmingham&quot; next left the fleet on 26 June in company with three destroyers to shell Japanese positions on Tinian, particularly in Tinian Town, the main settlement on the island. They also used white phosphorus shells to set fire to sugar cane fields near the town, and they sank five sampans in port. The Americans then withdrew to replenish ammunition before returning to Tinian the next day for further bombardments. Over the course of the day&#x27;s shelling, the ships destroyed about seventy-five percent of Tinian Town and burned much of the surrounding farmland. &quot;Birmingham&quot; moved back to Saipan on 28 June and resumed gunfire support duties off Garapan, which she carried out for the next several days. These operations included destroying three Japanese tanks on 5 July. The next day, &quot;Birmingham&quot; returned to Tinian to resume attacks on that island through the day, before withdrawing later in the evening.

With Saipan under American control, the ship next joined the bombardment group covering the invasion of Guam on 21 July. She attacked Japanese positions on the island as American troops went ashore but encountered little return fire. On 23 July, she returned to Saipan to begin preparatory bombardments for the invasion of Tinian, which took place two days later. During the preparatory phase, &quot;Birmingham&quot; closed with the shore and used her 20 mm and 40 mm guns to attack Japanese trench lines. On the 25th, one of her spotter aircraft estimated that the ship had killed approximately 250 soldiers. She remained off Tinian through 1 August, bombarding Japanese forces as American troops fought to secure the island. In the course of operations during the campaign, &quot;Birmingham&quot; fired a total of 7,683 rounds from her main guns and 10,875 shells from her 5-inch guns. On 7 August, &quot;Birmingham&quot; got underway, bound for Eniwetok for maintenance and to replenish ammunition and stores in preparation for the next stage of the campaign.

She then joined TG 38.5, which sortied on 3 September to attack the Palau Islands in the western Carolines. She joined the screen for the carriers and &quot;Lexington&quot; and the light carrier , which carried out a series of air strikes on Anguar, Pelelieu, and Babeldaob between 6 and 7 September. These marked the beginning of preparatory attacks leading to the invasion of Pelelieu the following week. The Fast Carrier Task Force moved on to attack airfields in the southern Philippines, both to draw Japanese attention away from Palau and to neutralize aircraft that might interfere with the invasion. These attacks began on 9 September. During one of these raids, aircraft spotted a Japanese convoy of small coastal vessels off Mindanao; &quot;Birmingham&quot;, her sister , and the destroyers , , , and were detached to intercept it. American aircraft helped direct the ships to their target, and in the course of the action, &quot;Birmingham&quot; sank three cargo ships, a large sampan, and a small motor boat, and she assisted in the destruction of eight smaller vessels. &quot;Birmingham&quot; and the rest of the ships returned to the carriers, which continued to strike targets in the Philippines through 12 September. During this period, &quot;Birmingham&quot; used one of her seaplanes to recover a downed pilot from the carrier . The fleet returned to the Carolines for further strikes there, before resuming attacks on the Philippines later in September. On 27 September, the fleet withdrew to the Kossol Roads to refuel and replenish ammunition.

=====Philippines campaign=====

The fleet then moved north to its next staging ground at Ulithi, and &quot;Birmingham&quot; arrived there on 2 October. There, she was assigned to TG 38.3, which sortied the next day to carry out an attack on the Ryukyu Islands. This raid was intended to reduce Japanese forces in the region that might interfere with the planned invasion of Leyte in the Philippines. The Fast Carrier Task Force arrived off the Ryukyus on 10 October and inflicted significant damage to Japanese aircraft and installations on the islands. The following day, the carriers turned their attention to the island of Luzon in the Philippines, striking airfields there and then shifting once again to Formosa on 12 October. The Formosa Air Battle continued into the next day, which saw intense Japanese counterattacks that damaged the heavy cruiser . &quot;Birmingham&quot; was among the vessels detached to cover the withdrawal of &quot;Canberra&quot;, which was towed by the heavy cruiser . The carriers&#x27; combat air patrol kept Japanese aircraft at bay, but later that morning, &quot;Birmingham&quot; left the &quot;Canberra&quot; group to cover the withdrawal of her sister , which had also been badly damaged by a Japanese torpedo bomber. The ships were still retreating on 16 February when they came under attack once again; &quot;Birmingham&quot; shot down a Nakajima B6N torpedo bomber, but it had already hit &quot;Houston&quot; with another torpedo. &quot;Birmingham&quot; also assisted in the destruction of another B6N that had attempted to attack &quot;Santa Fe&quot;.

&quot;Birmingham&quot; left the withdrawing formation on 17 October and rejoined TG 38.3, where she refueled at sea from the oiler . The Fast Carrier Task Force then covered the invasion of Leyte from 19 October, carrying out air strikes on various targets through the Philippines. Japanese air forces launched a series of counterattacks on 24 October, and during one of these, a Yokosuka D4Y dive bomber scored a hit on &quot;Princeton&quot; that caused serious damage and several large fires; &quot;Birmingham&quot; and the three destroyers &quot;Morrison&quot;, and remained with the stricken carrier after she fell out of formation. The destroyers initially attempted to come alongside and spray the burning carrier to help the ship&#x27;s crew suppress the fires, but they repeatedly collided with &quot;Princeton&quot; in the heavy seas. &quot;Birmingham&quot; then came alongside instead, as her larger hull could better absorb collisions. She sent thirty-eight men and fourteen water hoses over to &quot;Princeton&quot;, and they helped the carrier&#x27;s crew put out one of the two large fires.

Later in the day, &quot;Birmingham&quot; received reports of Japanese aircraft approaching, and around the same time, one of the destroyers reported detecting a submarine just away. &quot;Birmingham&quot; immediately pulled away from &quot;Princeton&quot; so she could evade any incoming attacks. Only one Japanese aircraft actually approached the formation, but it did not attack, and the submarine report was determined to have been a false alarm. &quot;Birmingham&quot; then returned alongside &quot;Princeton&quot; to resume firefighting, but at 15:22, just as she was coming back alongside &quot;Princeton&quot;, the fires reached the carrier&#x27;s aft magazines, setting off a catastrophic explosion. The blast destroyed much of the carrier&#x27;s stern, throwing debris all along &quot;Birmingham&quot;″s starboard side and inflicting grave casualties among the cruiser&#x27;s crew. Out of her crew of nearly 1,300, 241 men were killed, 211 were seriously wounded, and 201 received lighter injuries, more than half of the crew. The surviving crew began fighting several fires aboard &quot;Birmingham&quot; and treating the survivors, and then she broke off from the stricken carrier. Efforts continued aboard &quot;Princeton&quot;, but these ultimately proved futile, and &quot;Reno&quot; and &quot;Irwin&quot; scuttled her with torpedoes. &quot;Birmingham&quot; eventually arrived back at Mare Island in early November for repairs; during this period, she also received modifications to allow her to serve as a flagship. Her propulsion system was also overhauled, and she received all new 5- and 6-inch gun barrels, along with additional 20- and 40-millimeter gun mounts. Work on the ship was completed on 17 January 1945.

=====Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa=====
After returning to service, &quot;Birmingham&quot; briefly cruised off San Francisco to calibrate her equipment, before moving to San Diego for combat practice on 24 January. Over the next week, her crew took part in anti-aircraft gunnery drills, practicing operating her seaplanes, and other exercises, before departing on 4 February to rejoin the fleet. She stopped briefly in Pearl Harbor on the way, and arrived at Saipan on 25 February to refuel. The following day, she reached the fleet off Iwo Jima, where the Battle of Iwo Jima was already in full swing. On 1 March, she joined the coastal bombardment force and began engaging Japanese targets on the island. She operated there for the next five days, during which time she destroyed Japanese defensive positions in support of a marine advance on 1 March, supported another offensive on the eastern side of the island on 3 March, and shelled Japanese held caves from a distance of on 4 March. By that time, the marines had secured the airfield on the southern end of the island.

On 5 March, the heavy cruiser replaced &quot;Birmingham&quot; in the shore bombardment unit, and the latter vessel departed for Ulithi. After arriving on 8 March, she began to make preparations for the planned attack on Okinawa. She and the rest of the invasion fleet sortied on 21 March for the Ryukyus, arriving off the island four days later. She took part in a preparatory bombardment on the morning of 25 March, she retired to cover minesweepers clearing paths for the invasion craft. The next day, she joined a bombardment group that consisted of the battleships and , the light cruiser , and the heavy cruiser &quot;Wichita&quot;, along with escorting destroyers. The unit was stationed off the western coast of Okinawa to support American ground forces there, which had not yet gone ashore. The American commanders believed that the Japanese units on the island might attempt to board vessels in the invasion fleet, &quot;Birmingham&quot; distributed M1918 Browning Automatic Rifles to the 20 mm and 40 mm gun crews to defend against boarders.

On 26 March, numerous Japanese aircraft attacked the invasion fleet, and &quot;Birmingham&quot;″s gunners contributed to the fleet&#x27;s anti-aircraft defense. Later in the day, the bombardment group closed with the beaches to bombard Japanese defenses. &quot;Birmingham&quot; repeated these attacks in different sectors on 28 and 29 March, and also covered the operation of UDT units preparing the invasion beaches. The assault began on the morning of 1 April, and at 06:08, &quot;Birmingham&quot; opened fire on the target beaches. Shortly thereafter, a D3A bomber closed with the ship, but a 5-inch shell damaged the aircraft as it approached, slowing it so the 20 mm and 40 mm guns could take it under fire; the bomber exploded in mid-air some from the ship. Following the preparatory bombardment, the amphibious assault vessels began to go ashore, and &quot;Birmingham&quot; transferred control of her guns to a fire direction party ashore; she spent the rest of the day responding to requests for fire support as the soldiers and marines fought their way inland.

The ship remained off the island for the next several days, and on 6 April, she helped repel a large-scale aerial attack, during which her gunners shot down a D3A bomber and assisted with the destruction of three D4Y bombers. Planned fire support duty was canceled the following day when the American fleet received reports that the large battleship and several other vessels had sortied to attack the invasion fleet. &quot;Birmingham&quot; was among the vessels assembled to block the Japanese flotilla should it break through; she and two cruisers and ten destroyers took up a screening position on the right flank of the Allied fleet. At 19:11, &quot;Birmingham&quot; received news that American carrier aircraft had sunk &quot;Yamato&quot;, two light cruisers, and three destroyers, neutralizing the threat to the invasion beaches. She resumed bombardment duties the next day, remaining on station off the island until 12 April, when she was recalled to help defend the main fleet from a major Japanese air attack. During the action, her gunners claimed one Japanese aircraft.

&quot;Birmingham&quot; next moved to Iejima to conduct preparatory bombardments over the following three days before American forces landed on 16 April. The ship then withdrew to Kerama Retto to replenish ammunition and stores before returning to Okinawa to resume fire support missions there. These operations continued until 22 April, when she withdrew to Kerama Retto to take on more ammunition. She resumed bombarding Japanese positions on the island through the end of the month and into early May. These included attacks on the airfield at Naha to disrupt Japanese operations there. On 4 May, another major Japanese counterattack appeared, and at around 08:40, a Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa made a diving attack on &quot;Birmingham&quot;; the pilot approached from such a steep angle that only the 20 mm guns could elevate high enough to engage the aircraft, and they lacked the power to destroy the plane before it crashed into the ship. The blast destroyed the ship&#x27;s sick bay, penetrated three deck levels, and tore a hole in the hull below the waterline on the starboard side. The resulting fires were quickly suppressed and seriously injured men were transferred to the hospital ship . The killed fifty-two men and wounded another eighty-two. &quot;Birmingham&quot; came alongside the salvage ship for temporary repairs before departing for Guam on 5 May; she arrived there five days later, where she was dry-docked on 13 May.

=====End of the war and later career=====
On 21 May, &quot;Birmingham&quot; got underway to return to Pearl Harbor, arriving there seven days later. There, she was dry-docked at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on 7 June for repair work that lasted for six weeks. She emerged from the shipyard on 22 July, after which she took on ammunition, fuel, and stores before embarking on combat training in Hawaiian waters in preparation to resume operations against Japan. She departed Pearl Harbor on 12 August and joined TG 12.3, which was steaming to Wake Island, where she was to shell the isolated Japanese garrison there to practice gunnery drills. Three days later, while still en route to Wake, the ships received word that Japan had surrendered, so the attack on the island was called off. Over the course of her wartime career, &quot;Birmingham&quot; was awarded eight battle stars. The ship headed to Eniwetok, which she reached on 19 August. She refueled there and continued on to Okinawa, arriving there on 26 August. She was initially ordered to sail for Kyushu to take part in the occupation of Japan, and she got underway on 7 September, but while on the way her orders were changed to send her south to the naval forces stationed in Australia and New Guinea.

&quot;Birmingham&quot; sailed south, passing through Leyte on 14 September to refuel, and continuing on until she reached Brisbane, Australia, on 23 September. There, she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Clifford E. Van Hook, the commander of US naval forces in Australia. She served in this capacity for the next five months, cruising between Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. The ship eventually returned to San Francisco on 22 March 1946. On 2 April, she was moved to San Diego, where she was assigned to the 19th Fleet, to be prepared for decommissioning. On 16 October, she was assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet, San Diego, and on 2 January 1947, she was formally decommissioned. She remained in the Navy&#x27;s inventory for the next decade, ultimately being stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1959. &quot;Birmingham&quot; was then sold to the National Metals and Steel Corp. on 13 October to be broken up for scrap.

<text>The Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, on 1–2 November 1943 – also known as the Battle of Gazelle Bay, Operation Cherry Blossom, and in Japanese sources as the Sea Battle off Bougainville Island (ブーゲンビル島沖海戦) – was a naval battle fought at night in Empress Augusta Bay near Bougainville Island. The naval battle was a result of Allied landings at Cape Torokina in the first action in the Bougainville campaign of World War II. It may also be considered as part of the Solomons and New Guinea campaigns. The battle was significant as part of a broader Allied strategy—known as Operation Cartwheel—aimed at isolating and surrounding the major Japanese base at Rabaul. The intention was to establish a beachhead on Bougainville, within which an airfield would be built.

The naval battle took place at the end of the first day of the landings around Cape Torokina, as the Japanese sortied a large force from Rabaul in an effort to replicate the success they had achieved at Savo Island in August 1942, in response to Allied amphibious landings in the eastern Solomon Islands. Ultimately, the covering force of US warships was able to turn back the Japanese force, and the landings around Cape Torokina were successful.

==Background==
On 1 November 1943, the 3rd Marine Division landed at Cape Torokina in Empress Augusta Bay on Bougainville Island. Following in the wake of Allied successes in the Solomon Islands campaign, the landings were undertaken as part of an Allied plan to establish airbases in the region to project airpower towards the Japanese stronghold around Rabaul, the reduction and isolation of which was a key part of Operation Cartwheel. The bay had been chosen because it was at the outer limit of Allied fighter plane range and because the numerically superior Japanese 17th Army was concentrated at other, more strategic sites in the north and the south. The Marines were backed by Task Force 39, composed of cruisers and destroyers, commanded by Rear Admiral Aaron S. Merrill. Merrill&#x27;s force was tasked with covering the vulnerable transports and minelayers from air attack and from attack from the sea.
The Japanese responded with air attacks and a powerful naval force from Rabaul commanded by Rear Admiral Sentaro Omori, attempting to replicate the success they had achieved at Savo Island in August 1942, in response to Allied amphibious landings in the eastern Solomon Islands. The Japanese formation was hastily assembled from whatever ships were on hand, many of which had never trained or fought together before. Omori&#x27;s force consisted of the heavy cruisers and , the light cruisers and , and the destroyers , , , , , and . These were organised into a cruiser division (Cruiser Division 5), which contained the two heavy cruisers, and two screens (left and right) with a light cruiser and three destroyers. The left screen was commanded by Rear Admiral Ijuin Matsuji, while the right was under Rear Admiral Morikazu Osugi&#x27;s command. Initially, this force had included five destroyer transports laden with troops for a counter-landing, but following several delays, the decision was made for the transports to return to Rabaul. This force would later land around Koromokina Lagoon on 7/8 November.

Ranged against the Japanese force was Merrill&#x27;s Task Force 39 (TF39). The heart of TF39 was Cruiser Division (CruDiv) 12 – , , , and . These four s were officially categorized as light cruisers; however, they were nearly the size of the Japanese heavy cruisers and were armed with twelve radar-aimed rapid fire guns. TF39 also included Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 23, which consisted of two destroyer divisions (DesDiv): DesDiv 45 – , , , and DesDiv 46 – , , , . Merrill had overall command of the force, as well as directly commanding CruDiv 12, while Captain Arleigh Burke commanded DesDiv 45 and Commander Bernard Austin was in command of DesDiv 46.

==Battle==
As the Japanese ships cruised towards Cape Torokina, the Americans were already in the process of withdrawing most of their landing craft and troop transports from around Cape Torokina, and assembling them to the southwest of Empress Augusta Bay. The 12 transports were ordered to depart around 18:00, while four cargo vessels, still only partially unloaded, remained. The US minelayers operating off Cape Moltke were also withdrawn. Meanwhile, US reconnaissance aircraft had detected Omori&#x27;s force, and in response Merrill&#x27;s force, which had been shelling Japanese positions around Buka in northern Bougainville the day before, began steaming north from around Vella Lavella to intercept, departing before midnight on 1/2 November. They subsequently established themselves to block the entrance to Empress Augusta Bay. The Japanese approached from the northwest, aiming to bombard the invasion force in their transports and on the shore. At 01:30 on 2 November, &quot;Haguro&quot; was struck amidships by an American aerial attack. The resulting damage necessitated a significant reduction in speed for the entire formation.

The Americans made radar contact at 02:27 on 2 November. Merrill subsequently shook his force out into three columns, sending Burke&#x27;s destroyers to attack the Japanese northern flank, while the cruisers turned about to remain out of torpedo range, with the remaining destroyers from Austin&#x27;s group being tasked with launching a torpedo attack on the southern flank. From the leading position in the American formation, Burke sent the four destroyers of DesDiv 45 forward for a torpedo attack and at 02:46 fired a salvo toward the Japanese. Around the same time, the &quot;Sendai&quot;-led division fired eight torpedoes. Each attack was detected, and both groups maneuvered away from the torpedoes. The Japanese fleet became separated into three groups in the confusion.

Merrill then ordered DesDiv 46 to attack. Unprepared, &quot;Foote&quot; misinterpreted the command and was separated from the other ships. Despite her captain&#x27;s best efforts, &quot;Foote&quot; was unable to effectively rejoin the fight and was in some danger of colliding with other friendly ships. At around 02:50, when it became apparent that DesDiv 45&#x27;s torpedo attack had failed to achieve complete surprise, the American cruisers opened fire, quickly disabling &quot;Sendai&quot;, whose rudder jammed. 

After firing her torpedoes, &quot;Samidare&quot; collided with &quot;Shiratsuyu&quot;. &quot;Samidare&quot; and &quot;Shiratsuyu&quot; were subsequently forced to retire from the battle with &quot;Samidare&quot; receiving hits at 03:00. &quot;Myōkō&quot; also collided with &quot;Hatsukaze&quot;, slicing off her bows. &quot;Myōkō&quot; had significant damage from this collision. Meanwhile, &quot;Haguro&quot; was hit by several cruiser shells, only a few of which detonated. Relying on visual tracking of their targets, with difficulty, the Japanese cruisers pinpointed the American cruisers and opened fire at 03:13. At 03:20 the Cruiser Squadron fired several torpedoes at CruDiv 12. At 03:27 numerous hits on CruDiv 12 were erroneously reported to Omori, but all actually missed their targets.

The Americans were also having problems as &quot;Spence&quot; and &quot;Thatcher&quot; also collided but were able to continue in the battle. &quot;Foote&quot; was struck by a torpedo which blew off the stern of the ship, leaving 19 dead and 17 wounded. Subsequently, the drifting &quot;Foote&quot; became a navigational hazard to the other ships adding to the confusion of the battle. &quot;Foote&quot; was busy for the remainder of the engagement trying to stay afloat and fighting off an enemy aircraft attack. Without fire control radar, the Japanese depended heavily on flares to illuminate their targets. CruDiv 12 repeatedly maneuvered to avoid starshells fired by the opposing ships but was finally successfully illuminated by brilliant flares dropped by Japanese snooper aircraft.

Between 03:20 and 03:25 &quot;Denver&quot; received three hits which failed to detonate. Also, while closing with a group of Japanese destroyers in the center, &quot;Spence&quot; was hit at the waterline by a shell that failed to explode. At this point the Japanese fire was heavy and increasingly accurate. In response, the American cruisers began maneuvering behind a smoke screen which successfully interfered with the Japanese gunnery.

Throughout the battle the American destroyers experienced difficulty maintaining contact with each other and several times came close to firing on friendly ships, underscoring the difficulty in fighting night actions even when equipped with radar and IFF systems. A later evaluation of the battle revealed that DesDiv 46 missed an opportunity to torpedo the center group of Japanese ships because of uncertain identification. DesDiv 46 then turned north and concentrated fire on &quot;Sendai&quot;.

By 03:37, Omori, believing that he had sunk a heavy cruiser and worried about being caught in daylight by US carrier aircraft, ordered a retreat. Merrill&#x27;s cruisers closed to bombard the Japanese forces withdrawing to the west, engaging &quot;Hatsukaze&quot; at over , but they were unable to score any hits.

Around 04:00, DesDiv 45 and 46 engaged in a confused melee with retreating Japanese stragglers, sinking &quot;Sendai&quot; and driving off the remaining northern group ships. Just before 04:13 &quot;Spence&quot; lost speed because of water in the fuel line and fell out of formation. The American ships reported many hits on the enemy contacts. DesDiv 45 fired on the limping &quot;Spence&quot; in error, causing no damage. CruDiv 12 and &quot;Spence&quot; engaged a Japanese straggler at 05:10. Unable to distinguish between the straggler and &quot;Spence,&quot; the cruisers ceased fire. By 05:19, DesDiv 45 came to the aid of &quot;Spence&quot; which by this time had almost exhausted its ammunition. The Japanese straggler, the heavily damaged &quot;Hatsukaze&quot;, exploded and sank.

At daylight the pursuit was broken off, and all ships, many low on fuel and ammunition, were ordered to rendezvous with the hapless &quot;Foote&quot;, as Merrill was concerned about the possibility of his ships being exposed to air attack. This proved prescient, as a heavy Japanese air attack, consisting of over 100 aircraft, was launched from Rabaul early in the morning, directed on the US ships that had converged around &quot;Foote&quot;. This was fought off with assistance from US and New Zealand shore-based aircraft, with heavy losses being inflicted on the attacking aircraft. The Japanese ships scored two hits on &quot;Montpelier&quot;, inflicting nine wounded. &quot;Foote&quot; was subsequently towed to Tulagi for repairs.

==Aftermath==

The battle ended in a complete victory for the US naval force, in what author Leo Marriott describes as the &quot;last major naval action...[of]...the Solomons campaign&quot;. They were able to deflect the Japanese away from the vulnerable transport ships and landing craft around Cape Torokina, and they had also inflicted significant damage on their opponents. For the loss of 19 killed and 26 wounded, and three ships damaged, the US ships sank one light cruiser and one destroyer and damaged two cruisers and two destroyers. Japanese casualties have been reported as being between 198 and 658 killed. Up to 25 Japanese aircraft were shot down in the air attack following the naval action. The Japanese subsequently sent a submarine to locate survivors; none were found from &quot;Hatsukaze&quot;, but some were rescued from &quot;Sendai&quot;.
In the aftermath, the Japanese ships returned to Rabaul. There, they were joined by four cruisers and more destroyers from Truk for another attack on the Allied landing forces at Bougainville. On 5 November, however, two US aircraft carriers raided Rabaul, heavily damaging four heavy cruisers, which had to withdraw to Truk. This ended the Japanese warship threat to the Allied landing forces at Bougainville. Omori was relieved of his command as a result of the failed action.

US ground forces secured their beachhead around Cape Torokina, and the perimeter was subsequently expanded. A PT boat base was established on Puruata Island, and several airbases were built around the Cape Torokina perimeter. These were subsequently employed in the reduction of Rabaul. On the ground, throughout the remainder of 1943, the US Marines and Japanese fought several minor land battles around the perimeter, culminating in a large scale Japanese counterattack in March 1944. This counterattack was fought off with Japanese heavy losses. By the start of February 1944, the US had built up a force of over 400 aircraft on Bougainville; before the month ended the Japanese air defenses around Rabaul had been defeated.

<doc id="532388" wikidata="Q6146770" url="?curid=532388" title="USS Bremerton (CA-130)">
<text>USS &quot;Bremerton&quot; (CA-130), was a &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class heavy cruiser, named for the city of Bremerton in Washington state.

== Construction and career ==
She was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden in New Jersey on 1 February 1943, launched on 2 July 1944 by Miss Elizabeth K. McGowan and commissioned on 29 April 1945, Captain John Boyd Mallard in command.

===1940s===

&quot;Bremerton&quot; left Norfolk for her shakedown cruise in the waters off Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 29 May 1945. Toward the end of the shakedown period she served as flagship for Admiral Jonas Ingram, Commander-in-Chief of the Atlantic Fleet, during his South American tour of inspection. She returned to the United States and engaged in experimental work at Casco Bay, Maine, from 22 July to 2 October 1945.

On 7 November 1945 she sailed to Guantanamo Bay for further training. She then proceeded to Pearl Harbor en route for duty in the 7th Fleet. &quot;Bremerton&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor 15 December 1945 and Inchon, Korea, 4 January 1946. She operated in the Far East until 20 November 1946, when she arrived at San Pedro, Calif. She participated in type training and made one reserve training cruise off the west coast before placed out of commission in reserve at San Francisco 9 April 1948.

===Korean War Service===

&quot;Bremerton&quot; was recommissioned 23 November 1951. After refresher training she joined the 7th Fleet for her first cruise of the Korean War zone. Her guns blasted enemy lines at Wonsan, Kojo, Chongjin, and Changjon Hang, Korea. On 13 September 1952 she was relieved and returned to Long Beach.

Seven months were devoted to overhaul, drills, and gunnery exercises, and then on 5 April 1953 &quot;Bremerton&quot; again departed Long Beach for a tour with the 7th Fleet. Upon joining TF 77 her guns pounded enemy installations, troops, and railroads in Korea.

Completing this tour in November 1953, &quot;Bremerton&quot; returned to Long Beach and commenced a shipyard overhaul. With overhaul completed, she conducted extensive training and then departed for another tour of the Western Pacific 14 May 1954. On 4 April 1954 Commander Will P. Starnes assumed duties as Executive Officer and on 17 October 1954 &quot;Bremerton&quot; returned to Long Beach and was granted a thirty-day rest before continuing drills and gunnery exercises off Southern California coast.

===Post Korean War===

In January 1955, &quot;Bremerton&quot; proceeded to Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, for her regular overhaul period. At Mare Island &quot;Bremerton&quot; underwent a thorough revamping under the Navy&#x27;s high-geared program of improved habitability and fighting efficiency.

On 12 July 1955 after a rigid training period, &quot;Bremerton&quot; again sailed for duties in the Far East. On this trip to the Western Pacific, &quot;Bremerton&quot; served as the flagship for Rear Admiral D. M. Tyree, Commander Cruiser Division One, later relieved by Rear Admiral H. L. Collins. For two weeks in October she served as temporary flagship for Vice Admiral A. M. Pride, Commander Seventh Fleet, in Keelung, Formosa. During this Far Eastern tour, Bremerton participated in five operations with Task Force 77. For her operations with Nationalist Forces she earned her second China Service Medal. While in Formosa, her crew participated in the Chinese Nationalist celebration of Double Ten Day with Chiang Kai-Shek presiding.

On 10 January 1956 while the Bremerton was in Yokosuka, Commander Robert M. Brownlie assumed duties as Bremerton&#x27;s Executive Officer. Then on 12 February Bremerton returned home to Long Beach, California, and on 28 February Captain Charles C. Kirkpatrick assumed command. Bremerton was awarded a white &quot;E&quot; and a green &quot;E&quot; for excellence for winning the Battle Efficiency competition among cruisers of the Pacific Fleet for the fiscal year 1956 and on 1 September 1956, Command was assumed by Captain Raymond H. Bass.

On 6 November 1956 &quot;Bremerton&quot; left her home port of Long Beach for the Orient once more, but this time going via Melbourne, Australia and the XVI Olympiad. Besides Australia, &quot;Bremerton&quot; visited Redondo Beach, Monterey, Victoria, British Columbia, Seattle, Pearl Harbor, Guam, Kwajalein Atoll, the Japanese ports of Yokosuka, Kobe, Beppu, Okinawa, Keelung, Formosa, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, the cities Manila and Olongapo in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Dingalon Bay. &quot;Bremerton&quot; returned to Long Beach in May 1957. Around this time she was selected for conversion to the guided missile cruiser CG-14, but funding was deleted from the Navy&#x27;s budget. She continued on in service for a few more years after the conversion was cancelled.

=== Decommissioning ===
&quot;Bremerton&quot; was scheduled to undergo a major conversion to become one of the planned guided missile cruisers, with the ship allocated the new number CG-14. However, the cost of this process, along with the similar conversion of , was deemed too high, and so was cancelled. &quot;Bremerton&quot; was decommissioned on 29 July 1960 after serving a total of 11.5 years in commissioned service. She lingered in the mothball fleet but was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1973, along with several of her sister ships. Sold to Zidell Explorations Corp., Portland Oregon on 11 July 1974.

<doc id="532389" wikidata="Q476218" url="?curid=532389" title="USS Bunker Hill (CG-52)">
<text>USS &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; (CG-52) is a decommissioned guided missile cruiser of the United States Navy constructed by Litton-Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation at Pascagoula, Mississippi and launched on 11 March 1985. The &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers are equipped with the Aegis Combat System and &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was the first of the class to be equipped with the Mark 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) in place of the previous ships&#x27; twin-arm Mark 26 missile launchers, which greatly improved the flexibility and firepower of the ships by allowing them to fire BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles for land attack missions. Other missions include ballistic missile defence and capital ship escort for anti-aircraft defense. The ship was commissioned on 20 September 1986 and was homeported at Naval Base San Diego in San Diego, California.

&quot;Bunker Hill&quot; saw service in the Persian Gulf during the Gulf War and deployed off the Somalian coast to prevent piracy. The cruiser had forward deployed to Yokosuka, Japan and performed missions in the Pacific, including monitoring missions during the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis.

&quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was decommissioned on 22 September 2023 at Naval Base San Diego.

==Service history==
===1980s===
After commissioning in Charlestown, Massachusetts, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; entered the Pacific Ocean via the Panama Canal and began short notice work-ups to deploy to the U.S. Seventh Fleet. She made her first deployment in July 1987, nearly one year ahead of schedule.

During READIEX 87-5, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; first operated with Battle Group Sierra which consisted of Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 1, the battleship , cruiser , destroyer , frigate , and supply vessel . She deployed as part of Battle Group Sierra (Task Group 30.7). Following an upkeep period at Subic Bay in the Philippines, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; became Anti-Air Warfare Coordinator for Battle Group Sierra (TG 70.10), now en route to the North Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman. During the deployment she provided an anti-air warfare umbrella inside the Persian Gulf for &quot;Missouri&quot; and other US-flagged tankers and ships transiting through the Strait of Hormuz.

In August 1988, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;″s homeport was shifted from San Diego to Yokosuka, Japan joining the Carrier Battle Group. She then deployed with the &quot;Midway&quot; group for four months with the Seventh Fleet, for which she was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation. She was also awarded her first Battle Efficiency Award.

===1990s===
In November 1990, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; sailed in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm and served as the multinational Air Warfare Commander (AAWC) and as one of the first ships to launch a Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise Missile against Iraqi targets. Following the conclusion of the Persian Gulf War, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; participated in organizing and establishing Operation Southern Watch, the complex enforcement of the United Nations-established no-fly zone over southern Iraq. &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; made a historical visit to the Russian city Vladivostok in 1993, and then one year later she made a port visit to Qingdao in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In March 1996, during the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis, she took station south of Taiwan to monitor missile tests by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

In July 1998, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;″s homeport was shifted from Yokosuka, Japan back to San Diego.

===2000s===
In late 2000, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; deployed with the Battle Group. She again participated in Operation Southern Watch and conducted boardings and inspections of over 40 merchant vessels in support of United Nations sanctions against Iraq. &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; also escorted the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) while conducting humanitarian operations off East Timor and training exercises in Kuwait. &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; acted as Air Defense Commander for the ARG where she designed and implemented innovative procedures for CG integration into an ARG. Following the attack on the destroyer , &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; sortied from Bahrain to provide support and protection to seven United States Navy and United States Naval Ships (auxiliary vessels) based there and subsequently remained at sea for 67 consecutive days. &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; returned from deployment in February 2001.

Since her commissioning, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; has deployed six times to the Persian Gulf and has earned fifteen Battle &quot;E&quot; Awards, including the Golden Battle &quot;E&quot; in 1996 and 2006 which is given when a ship receives five such awards consecutively.
In March 2003, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was assigned to Cruiser-Destroyer Group 3. &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; went on to fire a total of 31 Tomahawk missiles in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

In December 2004 &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; left San Diego again under the command of ESG-5 for a deployment to the Middle East. In December 2004 the ship detoured to the coast of Banda Aceh to provide humanitarian assistance to the Indonesian province as one of the first responders to the earthquake and subsequent tsunami which destroyed the coastal regions of the province. After completing its humanitarian aid mission in Indonesia, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; proceeded to the Fifth Fleet area of responsibility. After checking into CTF-150, and while off the coast of Oman, the ship deployed one of its helicopters on 31 January 2005 to medevac a Japanese mariner with a life-threatening illness from MV &quot;Apollo Sun&quot; to Seeb International Airport near Muscat, Oman. The ship returned from deployment to its home port in San Diego in May 2005.

In March 2006, it was announced that Lockheed Martin would upgrade the Aegis Combat System on 22 navy vessels; &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was the first slated to receive the upgrade. In January 2007, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was sent to the coast of Somalia to conduct anti-terrorist operations as part of the task force. She was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation for this role. On 28 February 2008, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was awarded the 2007 Battle &quot;E&quot; award, her 6th consecutive Battle &quot;E&quot;.

From 1 October 2009, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was assigned to Carrier Strike Group One, whose flagship was the aircraft carrier .

===2010s===

In January 2010, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; sailed for Haiti, part of the US Navy&#x27;s force providing disaster relief after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

In February 2011, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; along with the destroyer broke up a pirate attack on a tanker while patrolling the Gulf of Oman. The ships chased away two skiffs, eventually sinking both after they had returned to their mothership.

In 2011–2012 the ship deployed with Carrier Strike Group One. On 22 October 2012, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; began a five-month Drydocking Selected Restricted Availability (DSRA) maintenance period at the BAE Systems Inc. shipyard in San Diego, California.

In October 2017, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; deployed from San Diego as part of Carrier Strike Group Nine to the Western Pacific Ocean and Persian Gulf.

===2020s===

In December 2020 the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Report to Congress on the Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels stated that the ship was planned to be placed Out of Commission in Reserve in 2023. On 22 September 2023, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was decommissioned at Naval Base San Diego.

<doc id="532394" wikidata="Q148839" url="?curid=532394" title="Santa Cruz Islands">
<text>The Santa Cruz Islands form an archipelago in Temotu Province, Solomon Islands. They lie approximately to the southeast of the Solomon Islands archipelago, just north of the archipelago of Vanuatu and are considered part of the Vanuatu rain forests ecoregion. The term Santa Cruz Islands is sometimes used to encompass all the islands of Temotu Province, Solomon Islands.

==Geography==
The largest island is Nendö, which is also known as Santa Cruz Island proper. Lata, located on Nendö, is the largest town, and is the capital of Temotu Province.

Other islands belonging to the Santa Cruz group are Vanikoro (which is actually made up of two islands, Banie and its small neighbour Teanu) and Utupua. The table below provides basic data on these three islands.

The Santa Cruz Islands are less than five million years old and were pushed upward by the tectonic subduction of the northward-moving Indo-Australian Plate under the Pacific Plate. The islands are mostly composed of limestone and volcanic ash over limestone.

==Culture==

===Languages===
The native languages of the islands are classified as the Reef Islands – Santa Cruz languages, within the Oceanic subgroup of the Austronesian language family.

===Ocean Navigation===

Historically, the people of Santa Cruz made long-distance ocean-going voyages using Tepukei. Tepukei are ocean-going outrigger canoes specific to some Polynesian societies of eastern Solomon Islands including Santa Cruz. In 1966 Gerd Koch, a German anthropologist, carried out research at Graciosa Bay on Nendö Island (Ndende/Ndeni) in the Santa Cruz Islands and on Pileni and Fenualoa in the Reef Islands, and returned with documentary film, photographic and audio material. The films that Koch completed are now held by the German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB) in Hanover. He brought back to the Ethnological Museum of Berlin the last still complete Tepukei from the Santa Cruz Islands. In 1971 Koch published &quot;Die Materielle Kultur der Santa Cruz-Inseln&quot; (The Material Culture of the Santa Cruz Islands).

Navigators from the Santa Cruz islands retained traditional navigation techniques into the 20th century; these techniques were also known by the navigators of the Caroline Islands. In 1969, Tevake accompanied David Henry Lewis on his ketch &quot;Isbjorn&quot; from Taumako using traditional navigation techniques by studying wave patterns and made landfall at Fenualoa, having navigated for without being able to view the stars, due to cloud cover. On a second voyage from Nifiloli to Vanikoro, Tevake navigated by the stars, wave patterns, and the patterns of bioluminescence that indicated the direction in which islands were located.

==Contact with other cultures==
The islands were visited by Spanish explorer Álvaro de Mendaña, the first European to sight them, on his second Pacific expedition in 1595. Mendaña started a colony on Nendö which he named &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;, at the place also named by the Spaniards as Graciosa Bay, and he died there in 1596.

==World War II==
During the Pacific campaign of World War II, the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands was fought north of the Santa Cruz group and some United States Navy seaplanes were based in Graciosa Bay, with one reportedly sinking at the seaplane base there. U.S. Navy Patrol Squadron 23 (VP-23), known as the &quot;Seahawks,&quot; was stationed at Graciosa Bay, from which it operated Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats, including on &quot;Black Cat&quot; night missions. Chemical ordnance stored on Vanikoro Island during World War II was not completely removed until the 1990s.

==2013 Solomon Islands earthquake==
The Santa Cruz Islands were affected by the 2013 Solomon Islands earthquake and subsequent tsunami on 6 February 2013. The earthquake produced a tsunami measuring at Lata, Solomon Islands, that reached about inland. The airport and low-lying areas were flooded, killing nine people, five of them elderly and one a child. More than 100 houses on the island were damaged, and the water and electricity services were interrupted. It was reported that almost all houses in Nela village were washed away, and some homes in Venga village were shifted by water.

<doc id="532396" wikidata="Q492079" url="?curid=532396" title="USS Cape St. George">
<text>USS &quot;Cape St. George&quot; (CG-71) is a &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruiser laid down by the Litton-Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation at Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 19 November 1990, launched on 10 January 1992, and commissioned on 12 June 1993. &quot;Cape St. George&quot; operates out of San Diego, California, and administratively reports to the Commander, Naval Surface Forces Pacific.

==Name==
&quot;Cape St. George&quot; is named for the World War II Battle of Cape St. George near New Ireland in Papua New Guinea, where a U.S. Navy destroyer force led by Captain Arleigh Burke defeated a Japanese destroyer force on 25 November 1943.

==History==
In March 2003, she was a first responder in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, awaiting orders from the Mediterranean Sea, off the coast of Turkey. She was part of Cruiser-Destroyer Group 8. The helicopter squadron attached to the ship during this cruise was HSL-44 (out of Mayport Naval Station). During this deployment, the &quot;Cape St. George&quot; became one of the first US Navy ships to fire cruise missiles from the Mediterranean at a target (Iraq). The &quot;Cape&quot; soon set sail for the Persian Gulf to continue missile-support operations after the government of Turkey claimed that a cruise missile landed, intact, on Turkish soil, resulting in US warships being forbidden from firing missiles over Turkish airspace. The &quot;Cape St. George&quot; then became the first US Navy ship ever to fire from two theaters of battle in history during her five-month cruise, the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. The photograph of the USS &quot;Cape St. George&quot; firing its first missile at Iraq from the Mediterranean Sea was taken by one of two sailors deployed in one of the &quot;Cape&#x27;s&quot; two rigid-hull inflatable boats. Video footage was also taken and was seen shortly after on CNN. The photograph made newspapers nationwide soon after and is now the &quot;Cape&#x27;s&quot; token photograph.

In May 2005, &quot;Cape St. George&quot; became the first surface warship certified to use only digital nautical charts, instead of paper charts using the Voyage Management System (VMS). About 12,000 paper charts have been replaced by 29 computer discs. VMS is part of the Smart Ship Integrated Bridge System, which has been under development since 1990.

On 18 March 2006, she was involved in a firefight with suspected pirates, along with . The two US warships exchanged fire with the suspected pirates about off the coast of Somalia. Initial reports indicated that one suspected pirate was killed and five others wounded, while &quot;Cape St. George&quot; took superficial damage from small-arms fire during the action.

In March 2007, Seaman Richard Mott slashed the throat of Seaman Jose Garcia from behind as the 18-year-old ate breakfast on the berthing barge nested aside the ship, while she was pierside at BAE Shipyards Norfolk, Virginia, for repairs. Garcia was seriously injured, but survived. On 7 November 2008, Mott was found guilty of attempted murder and was sentenced to 12 years in prison.

In July 2007, &quot;Cape St. George&quot; departed Norfolk in transit to her new homeport of San Diego, California as part of the realignment of naval forces following the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review.

On 17 October 2010, the aircraft carrier and &quot;Cape St. George&quot; arrived off the coast of Pakistan to support the coalition troop surge in landlocked Afghanistan.

On 31 January 2011, &quot;Cape St. George&quot; responded to a distress call from a sinking Iranian dhow by dispatching a rescue team via a rigid-hulled inflatable boat. The rescue team attempted to repair the dhow&#x27;s bilge pumps, but they were unable to stop the flooding. The Iranian fishermen were brought aboard &quot;Cape St. George&quot;, where they were examined by the medical staff before being transferred to an Iranian customs vessel.

On 6–10 January 2012, accompanying carrier &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, &quot;Cape St. George&quot; visited the Gulf of Thailand port of Laem Chabang. During the visit, Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia (GDMA) provided husbanding services, for which the Navy was billed a total of $884,000. In November 2013, federal prosecutors charged that the Navy had been overbilled more than $500,000.

In October 2019 it was announced that &quot;Cape St. George&quot; would be shifting to Seattle, WA to complete a Depot Level Modernization Period at Vigor Marine&#x27;s Harbor Island facility starting in December 2019. &quot;Cape St. George&quot; arrived in Seattle in August, 2020.

<text>Palisadoes (word apparently of Portuguese origin) is the thin tombolo of sand that serves as a natural protection for Kingston Harbour, Jamaica. Norman Manley International Airport and the historic town of Port Royal are both on Palisadoes.

The privateer Henry Morgan was buried in Palisadoes cemetery, which sank beneath the sea after the 1692 earthquake.

There are concerns that activities of sight seers who litter the place may lead to infestation by roaches.

Some organisation have made efforts in 2023 to clean up the place to address possible pollution with plastics and infestation by roaches and rodents

<text>The National Gallery of Jamaica, in Kingston, Jamaica, is Jamaica&#x27;s public art museum. It was established in 1974 and is located in the Kingston Mall, a commercial and cultural center on Kingston harbour. The National Gallery of Jamaica also has a branch in Montego Bay, National Gallery West.

The gallery houses several important works, mostly by artists from Jamaica, including John Dunkley, Mallica &quot;Kapo&quot; Reynolds, Edna Manley, Barrington Watson, Albert Artwell, Everald Brown, Cecil Baugh, Albert Huie, Carl Abrahams, Osmond Watson, Judy Ann MacMillan, Omari Ra, Laura Facey, Jasmine Thomas-Girvan, Petrona Morrison, Hope Brooks, Ebony G. Patterson, Philip Thomas and Leasho Johnson .

The National Gallery also exhibits works by various international artists and traveling exhibitions. It offers research material on Jamaican art and culture, and coordinates educational programmes.

==History==

In 1972 an advisory committee was set up, including Sam Hart, Vayden McMorris, Edna Manley, Ralph Thompson, Bernard Lewis, Osmond Watson and Karl ‘Jerry’ Craig and on 22 November 1974 the National Gallery of Jamaica (NGJ) opened at Devon House, supervised by Liz Milner. Its initial collection comprised 237 paintings and drawings and 25 sculptures that were transferred from the Institute of Jamaica. Maurice Facey was appointed the first Chairman of the NGJ Board of Directors and served in this capacity until 1977 when John Maxwell was appointed as the second chairman of the board. On 2 December 1975 the first appointments were made: David Boxer (Director/Curator), Vera Hyatt (deputy director), Roy Case (Director of Development).

On 19 July 1976 &quot;Five Centuries: Art in Jamaica since the Discovery&quot;, the first major survey exhibition on Jamaican art opened, curated by David Boxer. The inaugural &quot;Annual National Exhibition opened&quot; on 13 October 1977. It superseded the &quot;All Island&quot; and &quot;Self-Taught Artist&quot; annual exhibitions previously held at the Institute of Jamaica. In 1978 Boxer curated &quot;The Formative Years: Art in Jamaica 1922-1940&quot; which established 1922, the year Edna Manley arrived and started producing art in Jamaica, as the symbolic start date of modern Jamaican art.

In 1979 an exhibition called &quot;Intuitive Eye&quot;, curated by David Boxer, which introduced the concept of ‘Intuitive art’, opened.

In 1981 Maurice Facey was again appointed Chairman of the NGJ Board of Directors and in 1982 the Gallery moved to the Roy West Building, downtown Kingston where &quot;Kapo: The Larry Wirth Collection&quot;, was established as a permanent gallery. In 1983 the travelling exhibition &quot;Art in Jamaica: 1922 to 1982&quot; was launched as a collaboration between the NGJ and the Smithsonian Institution Travelling Exhibition Service (SITES). Curated by David Boxer and Vera Hyatt it was shown at various venues in the US, Canada and Haiti and finally at the NGJ in 1986.

In 1985 the &quot;Young Talent ’85&quot; exhibition was held, starting the series, &quot;Young Talent.&quot; Other &quot;Young Talent&quot; exhibitions followed in 1989, 1995, 2002 and 2010. In 1986 the first exhibition of installation art in Jamaica, &quot;Six Options&quot; curated by Rosalie Smith-McCrea was held.  

The first &quot;Caribbean Invitational&quot; exhibition, curated by David Boxer opened in 1988. Participating artists included Francisco Cabral (Trinidad and Tobago), Annalee Davis (Barbados), Brent Malone (Bahamas) and Bernard Sejourne (Haiti). Another &quot;Caribbean Invitational&quot; was held in 1996.

Several other exhibitions and retrospectives were held in the intervening years (for a complete list see here). In 1992 Aaron Matalon became the third Chairman of the NGJ Board of Directors.

On 1 March 2000 the Edna Manley Galleries opened, dedicated to Manley’s life and work, featuring work from the Edna Manley Memorial Collection and other sources.

In 2003 Maria Jones became the fourth and thus far only female Chair of the NGJ Board of Directors. In 2006 Trevor Blake became the fifth Chair and in 2008 Wayne Chen was appointed sixth Chairman of the NGJ Board of Directors. In 2009 Veerle Poupeye was appointed the first female Executive Director of the Gallery and in 2012 Peter Reid is appointed seventh Chairman of the NGJ Board of Directors. In January 2014 Charles Campbell began as Chief Curator and continued in this capacity until 31 July. In 2016 Senator Tom Tavares-Finson became the eighth Chairman of the Board of the NGJ.

<text>Jamaican culture consists of the religion, norms, values, and lifestyle that define the people of Jamaica. The culture is mixed, with an ethnically diverse society, stemming from a history of inhabitants beginning with the original inhabitants of Jamaica (the Taínos). The Spaniards originally brought slavery to Jamaica. Then they were overthrown by the English. Jamaica later gained emancipation on 1 August 1838, and independence from the British on 6 August 1962. Black slaves became the dominant cultural force as they suffered and resisted the harsh conditions of forced labour. After the abolition of slavery, Chinese and Indian migrants were transported to the island as indentured workers, bringing with them ideas from their country.

==Language==
The official language of Jamaica is Jamaican Standard English, which is used in all official circumstances in the country. In addition to English, there is a creole derivative called Jamaican Patois (pronounced patwa, ()) which is the common language among Jamaican citizens.

==Religion==

By far, the largest religion in Jamaica is the Christian faith. The Anglican Church, Catholic Church, Methodist Church, Baptists, Seventh-Day and the Church of God are present throughout the country. Many old churches have been carefully maintained and/or restored. The Rastafari movement is a derivative of the larger Christian culture, but its origins were influenced by rising consciousness of Africa, and an awareness of political events in that continent. There is also a small number of Jewish synagogues in Jamaica, dating from the 17th century along with a few mosques. 

Elements of ancient African religions remain, especially in remote areas throughout the island. Some of these practices are described generally as Obeah, 
Kumina, or Pocomania. Though the congregations are small, they are visited by many Christians and non-Christians seeking an experience they have not found in the churches. It is estimated that as much as 40% of the population secretly seek the services of the African traditional religious healers (also called Obeah workers) when confronted with serious problems that conventional medicine cannot remedy.

The Baháʼí Faith arrived in Jamaica in 1943, brought by an American Baháʼí pioneer, Dr. Malcolm King. In 2003, as part of the 60th anniversary celebration of the establishment of Baháʼí in Jamaica, the Governor General of Jamaica, Sir Howard Cooke, proclaimed a National Baháʼí Day to be held annually on 25 July. In 2005, the community of about 5000 celebrated their activity and presence in Jamaica with the international Baháʼí choir, &quot;The Voices of Bahá&quot;. The choir performed at Ward Theater and the University of the West Indies&#x27; Chapel, with proceeds earmarked to two Jamaican charities, (one serving families of policemen slain in the line of duty, and the one Denham Town Golden Age Home).

Other religions practiced in Jamaica include Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam.

===Rastafari===

Originating in the 1930s, one of the most prominent, internationally known aspects of Jamaica&#x27;s African-Caribbean culture is the Rastafari movement, particularly those elements that are expressed through reggae music. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Bob Marley became the most high-profile exponent of the Rastafari culture and belief system. His reputation as an innovative musician devoted to his faith has continued to grow since his death, so that by 2004 his greatest hits compilation, &quot;Legend&quot;, had sold 20 million copies worldwide, making him arguably the world&#x27;s most famous Jamaican in the music industry, and certainly the nation&#x27;s biggest-selling recording artist.

Rastafari itself is a monotheistic belief system, based on teachings found in the Old Testament and the New Testament – particularly the Book of Revelation. However, what distinguishes Rastafari from Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, (which also cite Abrahamic beliefs), is that Rastas believe in the divinity of the Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia.

Hailed by Rastas as H.I.M. (His Imperial Majesty), Haile Selassie I is regarded as God himself, the true descendant of Solomon, and the earthly embodiment of Jah (God) – in what believers see as a fulfillment of prophecy regarding the second coming of the Messiah.

Those Rasta beliefs, which are not explicitly mentioned in the Bible (such as the specific name of H.I.M. &quot;Haile Selassie&quot;), are not gathered into a single holy text. Instead, Rasta beliefs are primarily shared through a community of songs, chants, and oral testimonies, as well as in written texts (including websites). The extensive use of song makes Rastafari a particularly musical source of Jamaican culture.

Rasta cultural traditions include wearing their hair in uncut, uncombed strands known as dreadlocks (in adherence to the Nazarite vow), as well as eating unprocessed (natural) foods which are called &quot;Ital&quot;. However, neither tradition is regarded as compulsory – many people who wear dreadlocks are not Rastas, and many Rastas do not wear them.

One of the most controversial cultural traditions is Rastas&#x27; use of ganja as a sacrament which is smoked to aid in reasoning (contemplation and discussion) during their religious rituals. 

In its Jamaican homeland, Rastafari is a minority culture and receives little in the way of official recognition. Jamaica is an overwhelmingly Christian country, so Rasta beliefs and practices – such as the divinity of H.I.M Hailie Selassie – are sometimes regarded as pagan by Christian Jamaicans. (Some Rastas also express hostility towards aspects of Christianity.) Nevertheless, the artistic contributions of the movement, particularly by Bob Marley, are widely respected. Marley was awarded the Jamaican Order of Merit in 1981, and there are two official monuments to him.

Rastas can be found in many countries outside Jamaica and among many non-Jamaicans. Because it is not a centrally organised religion, there is no way of knowing how many devotees there are.

==Dance==
Dance has always been important to Jamaica – from colonial times until the present. Early folk rhythms and movements often enhanced Christian religious celebrations or were associated with Christian holidays. More recently, dances have become associated with the music of Jamaica, particularly dancehall styles.

Dance theatre is also growing in importance. Rex Nettleford, Eddy Thomas, Tony Wilson, Olive Lewin, and Edna Manley are five Jamaicans whose influences on the arts – music and dance in particular – have been extremely important. Nettleford, Thomas, and Ivy Baxter formed the National Dance Theatre Company in 1962. Other important Jamaicans in dance theatre have included the Tony Award-winning choreographer Garth Fagan (&quot;The Lion King&quot; on Broadway). 

Dancehall, or reggae, music has inspired a number of dance styles as well. To understand the evolution of popular dance, it helps to understand the musical progression. Ska music, with fast beats, also had fast dances. The slow to rocksteady also developed slower dances, allowing dancers to stay on the floor longer. Reggae is associated with many things, including the Rastafarian movement, but influenced the newer styles.

Dancehall music often creates its own dances based on moves in the lyrics of the songs themselves. Soca music from Trinidad and Tobago is popular with most of the popular artists from Trinidad, but many soca Jamaican artists such as Byron Lee, Fab 5, and Lovindeer are famous but also represent Jamaican music.

Daggering is a form of dance originating from Jamaica. The dance incorporates dry sex, wrestling and other forms of frantic movement.

Bruckins is a Jamaican dance performed to celebrate Emancipation Day.

==Theatre==
Jamaica&#x27;s earliest theatre was built in 1682. Several more theatres opened in the 1700s and 1800s, attracting performances by both professional touring companies and amateur groups. But performances weren&#x27;t limited to official venues. Many took place in houses, stores, courthouses, and enclosed outdoor spaces large enough to hold them. During this period, classic plays such as Shakespeare were most often produced. However, the Jewish and French communities became large enough to merit productions aimed at them, too.

After the abolishment of slavery, Jamaicans began fusing music, humour, and dance into public theatrical performances. Although it took many years for true Jamaican styles to develop, eventually they became more prevalent than European works. Today&#x27;s most popular theatrical form in Jamaica, pantomime, began in the 1940s as a fusion of English pantomime with Jamaican folklore. Another popular style, &quot;Roots&quot; (Grassroots) Theatre, evolved in the 1960s and 1970s. These riotous bawdy tales remained crowd favourites in Kingston&#x27;s open-air theatres.

One artist involved in root plays is Winsome (code name), a Jamaican writer and producer chronicled in Deborah Thomas&#x27; book &quot;Modern Blackness&quot;. Winsome handled all the publicity for her plays herself, and ended up putting them on in the rural areas surrounding Kingston – the city theaters refused to house her plays because of their controversial nature. In her plays, Winsome explores how sex, money, and power interact every day for Jamaicans. In 1997, Winsome wrote and produced a root play entitled Ruff Rider, in which family, sexual abuse, love, work, and friendship all intersect. According to author Thomas, author of, &quot;In all of her work, the sympathetic characters are those she portrays as struggling to balance their own pursuit of individual gain with &#x27;living well together&#x27; with others. As they negotiate the fine lines between egalitarianism and hierarchy, her characters also contribute to the public debate regarding the gendered dimensions of respectability and reputation.&quot;

Other notable roots play figures include Ralph Holness, Ginger Knight, Balfour Anderson, Michael Denton, Ian Reid, Paul Beil, Everton Dawkins, Luke Ellington (Lukington), Buddy Pouyat and the late Hyacinth Brown.

==Literature and writing==

Derek Walcott, a Nobel Prize laureate, born and educated in St. Lucia, attended college in Jamaica. Other significant writers from the island include Claude McKay and Louis Simpson. Plays and works in Jamaican English, or patois, attract special attention. Louise Bennett, Andrew Salkey and Mikey Smith have contributed to this phenomenon by writing works in patois. Ian Fleming wrote his famous James Bond novels while living in Jamaica. Jean Rhys is also well known for her novel &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot;, which was set in Jamaica. Jamaican writer Marlon James won the 2015 Man Booker Prize for his novel &quot;A Brief History of Seven Killings&quot;.

Jamaican authors are always faced with the decision of writing in standard English for a huge worldwide audience, or in the local patois, for a much smaller, but more trendy, audience. Jamaican films with patois sound-tracks such as &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; (1972) require sub-titles for export to general markets. In general, the use of patois severely limits the potential audience for the otherwise universal Jamaican message.

Recent poets laureate of Jamaica include Mervyn Morris (appointed in 2014) and his successor Lorna Goodison, appointed in 2017.

==Film==

Jamaica&#x27;s film industry is not widely known, but it is growing. &quot;The Harder They Come&quot;, &quot;Rasta Rockett&quot;, &quot;Shottas&quot;, &quot;Third World Cop&quot;, &quot;Rockers&quot;, &quot;Countryman&quot;, &quot;Dancehall Queen&quot; &amp; &quot; Real Ghetto Youths&quot; are a few of the best-known Jamaican movies. However, many popular Hollywood movies have also been filmed in Jamaica. A short list includes &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot;, &quot;Cocktail&quot;, &quot;Cool Runnings&quot; and James Bond films, &quot;Dr. No,&quot; &quot;Live and Let Die and No Time to Die.&quot;

Jamaica&#x27;s leading annual film event &quot;The Reggae Film Festival&quot; takes place each February in Jamaica&#x27;s capital city, Kingston. Members of Jamaica&#x27;s film industry gather here to make new links and many new projects have grown from the event.

Jamaica has many talented film makers but there is a great lack of available funds and resources for filmmakers. Since the creation of the Reggae Film Festival there have been many new films made in Jamaica and the event has given the industry a real boost, this combined with the recent CARICOM European film treaty which enables Jamaican filmmakers to seek funding in Europe, has opened up a new door for film makers looking to apply for funding and this will hopefully make a real difference to the future of the industry.

Other more recent feature films made in Jamaica are: &#x27;Almost Heaven&#x27;, &#x27;Roots Time&#x27;, &#x27;Wah Do Dem&#x27;, &#x27;Concrete Jungle&#x27;, &#x27;Redemption Paradise&#x27;, &#x27;Real Ghetto Youths&#x27;, and &#x27;Smile Orange&#x27;.

==Sport==
==Woodwork, furniture, and metalwork==
Jamaicans have a long history of fine craftsmanship in wood and metal. Jamaica was home to many excellent furniture factories dating from colonial times, and Jamaican &quot;Georgian&quot; furniture was exported to the metropolitan countries.
Jamaica is in the Caribbean so its exports of furniture is important.

<text>In quantum physics and chemistry, quantum numbers are quantities that characterize the possible states of the system. 
To fully specify the state of the electron in a hydrogen atom, four quantum numbers are needed. The traditional set of quantum numbers includes the principal, azimuthal, magnetic, and spin quantum numbers. To describe other systems, different quantum numbers are required. For subatomic particles, one needs to introduce new quantum numbers, such as the flavour of quarks, which have no classical correspondence.

Quantum numbers are closely related to eigenvalues of observables. When the corresponding observable commutes with the Hamiltonian of the system, the quantum number is said to be &quot;good&quot;, and acts as a constant of motion in the quantum dynamics.

== History ==
===Electronic quantum numbers===
In the era of the old quantum theory, starting from Max Planck&#x27;s proposal of quanta in his model of blackbody radiation (1900) and Albert Einstein&#x27;s adaptation of the concept to explain the photoelectric effect (1905), and until Erwin Schrödinger published his eigenfunction equation in 1926, the concept behind quantum numbers developed based on atomic spectroscopy and theories from classical mechanics with extra ad hoc constraints. Many results from atomic spectroscopy had been summarized in the Rydberg formula involving differences between two series of energies related by integer steps. The model of the atom, first proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913, relied on a single quantum number. Together with Bohr&#x27;s constraint that radiation absorption is not classical, it was able to explain the Balmer series portion of Rydberg&#x27;s atomic spectrum formula.

As Bohr notes in his subsequent Nobel lecture, the next step was taken by Arnold Sommerfeld in 1915. Sommerfeld&#x27;s atomic model added a second quantum number and the concept of quantized phase integrals to justify them. Sommerfeld&#x27;s model was still essentially two dimensional, modeling the electron as orbiting in a plane; in 1919 he extended his work to three dimensions using &#x27;space quantization&#x27; in place of the quantized phase integrals. Karl Schwarzschild and Sommerfeld&#x27;s student, Paul Epstein, independently showed that adding third quantum number gave a complete account for the Stark effect results.

A consequence of space quantization was that the electron&#x27;s orbital interaction with an external magnetic field would be quantized. This seemed to be confirmed when the results of the Stern-Gerlach experiment reported quantized results for silver atoms in an inhomogeneous magnetic field. The confirmation would turn out to be premature: more quantum numbers would be needed.

The fourth and fifth quantum numbers of the atomic era arose from attempts to understand the Zeeman effect. Like the Stern-Gerlach experiment, the Zeeman effect reflects the interaction of atoms with a magnetic field; in a weak field the experimental results were called &quot;anomalous&quot;, they diverged from any theory at the time. Wolfgang Pauli&#x27;s solution to this issue was to introduce another quantum number taking only two possible values, formula_1. This would ultimately become the quantized values of the projection of spin, an intrinsic angular momentum quantum of the electron. In 1927 Ronald Fraser demonstrated that the quantization in the Stern-Gerlach experiment was due to the magnetic moment associated with the electron spin rather than its orbital angular momentum. Pauli&#x27;s success in developing the arguments for a spin quantum number without relying on classical models set the stage for the development of quantum numbers for elementary particles in the remainder of the 20th century.

Bohr, with his Aufbau or &quot;building up&quot; principle, and Pauli with his exclusion principle connected the atom&#x27;s electronic quantum numbers in to a framework for predicting the properties of atoms. When Schrödinger published his wave equation and calculated the energy levels of hydrogen, these two principles carried over to become the basis of atomic physics.

===Nuclear quantum numbers===
With successful models of the atom, the attention of physics turned to models of the nucleus. Beginning with Heisenberg&#x27;s initial model of proton-neutron binding in 1932, Eugene Wigner introduced isospin in 1937, the first &#x27;internal&#x27; quantum number unrelated to a symmetry in real space-time.

===Connection to symmetry===
As quantum mechanics developed, abstraction increased and models based on symmetry and invariance played increasing roles. Two years before his work on the quantum wave equation, Schrödinger applied the symmetry ideas originated by Emmy Noether and Hermann Weyl to the electromagnetic field. As quantum electrodynamics developed in the 1930s and 1940s, group theory became an important tool. By 1953 Chen Ning Yang had become obsessed with the idea that group theory could be applied to connect the conserved quantum numbers of nuclear collisions to symmetries in a field theory of nucleons. With Robert Mills, Yang developed a non-abelian gauge theory based on the conservation of the nuclear isospin quantum numbers.

==General properties==

Good quantum numbers correspond to eigenvalues of operators that commute with the Hamiltonian, quantities that can be known with precision at the same time as the system&#x27;s energy. Specifically, observables that commute with the Hamiltonian are simultaneously diagonalizable with it and so the eigenvalues formula_2 and the energy (eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian) are not limited by an uncertainty relation arising from non-commutativity. Together, a specification of all of the quantum numbers of a quantum system fully characterize a basis state of the system, and can in principle be measured together. Many observables have discrete spectra (sets of eigenvalues) in quantum mechanics, so the quantities can only be measured in discrete values. In particular, this leads to quantum numbers that take values in discrete sets of integers or half-integers; although they could approach infinity in some cases.

The tally of quantum numbers varies from system to system and has no universal answer. Hence these parameters must be found for each system to be analyzed. A quantized system requires at least one quantum number. The dynamics (i.e. time evolution) of any quantum system are described by a quantum operator in the form of a Hamiltonian, . There is one quantum number of the system corresponding to the system&#x27;s energy; i.e., one of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. There is also one quantum number for each linearly independent operator that commutes with the Hamiltonian. A complete set of commuting observables (CSCO) that commute with the Hamiltonian characterizes the system with all its quantum numbers. There is a one-to-one relationship between the quantum numbers and the operators of the CSCO, with each quantum number taking one of the eigenvalues of its corresponding operator. As a result of the different basis that may be arbitrarily chosen to form a complete set of commuting operators, different sets of quantum numbers may be used for the description of the same system in different situations.

==Electron in a hydrogen-like atom==
Four quantum numbers can describe an electron energy level in a hydrogen-like atom completely:

*Principal quantum number ()
*Azimuthal quantum number ()
*Magnetic quantum number ()
*Spin quantum number ()
These quantum numbers are also used in the classical description of nuclear particle states (e.g. protons and neutrons). A quantum description of molecular orbitals requires other quantum numbers, because the symmetries of the molecular system are different.

=== Principal quantum number ===
The principal quantum number describes the electron shell of an electron. The value of ranges from 1 to the shell containing the outermost electron of that atom, that is
formula_3

For example, in caesium (Cs), the outermost valence electron is in the shell with energy level 6, so an electron in caesium can have an value from 1 to 6. The average distance between the electron and the nucleus increases with .

=== Azimuthal quantum number ===
The azimuthal quantum number, also known as the &quot;orbital angular momentum quantum number&quot;, describes the subshell, and gives the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum through the relation

formula_4

In chemistry and spectroscopy, is called s orbital, , p orbital, , d orbital, and , f orbital.

The value of ranges from 0 to , so the first p orbital () appears in the second electron shell (), the first d orbital () appears in the third shell (), and so on:

formula_5

A quantum number beginning in , describes an electron in the s orbital of the third electron shell of an atom. In chemistry, this quantum number is very important, since it specifies the shape of an atomic orbital and strongly influences chemical bonds and bond angles. The azimuthal quantum number can also denote the number of angular nodes present in an orbital. For example, for p orbitals, and thus the amount of angular nodes in a p orbital is 1.

=== Magnetic quantum number ===
The magnetic quantum number describes the specific orbital within the subshell, and yields the &quot;projection&quot; of the orbital angular momentum &quot;along a specified axis&quot;:

formula_6

The values of range from to , with integer intervals.

The s subshell () contains only one orbital, and therefore the of an electron in an s orbital will always be 0. The p subshell () contains three orbitals, so the of an electron in a p orbital will be −1, 0, or 1. The d subshell () contains five orbitals, with values of −2, −1, 0, 1, and 2.

=== Spin magnetic quantum number ===
The spin magnetic quantum number describes the intrinsic spin angular momentum of the electron within each orbital and gives the projection of the spin angular momentum along the specified axis:

formula_7

In general, the values of range from to , where is the spin quantum number, associated with the magnitude of particle&#x27;s intrinsic spin angular momentum:

formula_8

An electron state has spin number , consequently will be + (&quot;spin up&quot;) or - &quot;spin down&quot; states. Since electron are fermions they obey the Pauli exclusion principle: each electron state must have different quantum numbers. Therefore, every orbital will be occupied with at most two electrons, one for each spin state.

=== The Aufbau principle and Hund&#x27;s Rules ===

A multi-electron atom can be modeled qualitatively as a hydrogen like atom with higher nuclear charge and correspondingly more electrons. The occupation of the electron states in such an atom can be predicted by the Aufbau principle and Hund&#x27;s empirical rules for the quantum numbers. The Aufbau principle fills orbitals based on their principal and azimuthal quantum numbers (lowest first, with lowest breaking ties; Hund&#x27;s rule favors unpaired electrons in the outermost orbital). These rules are empirical but they can be related to electron physics.

==Spin-orbit coupled systems==
When one takes the spin–orbit interaction into consideration, the and operators no longer commute with the Hamiltonian, and the eigenstates of the system no longer have well-defined orbital angular momentum and spin. Thus another set of quantum numbers should be used. This set includes

# The total angular momentum quantum number: formula_9 which gives the total angular momentum through the relation formula_10
# The projection of the total angular momentum along a specified axis:formula_11 analogous to the above and satisfies both formula_12 and formula_13
# Parity&lt;br&gt;This is the eigenvalue under reflection: positive (+1) for states which came from even and negative (−1) for states which came from odd . The former is also known as even parity and the latter as odd parity, and is given byformula_14

For example, consider the following 8 states, defined by their quantum numbers:

The quantum states in the system can be described as linear combination of these 8 states. However, in the presence of spin–orbit interaction, if one wants to describe the same system by 8 states that are eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian (i.e. each represents a state that does not mix with others over time), we should consider the following 8 states:

==Atomic nuclei==
In nuclei, the entire assembly of protons and neutrons (nucleons) has a resultant angular momentum due to the angular momenta of each nucleon, usually denoted . If the total angular momentum of a neutron is and for a proton is (where for protons and neutrons happens to be again (&quot;see note&quot;)), then the nuclear angular momentum quantum numbers are given by:

formula_15

&quot;Note: &quot;The orbital angular momenta of the nuclear (and atomic) states are all integer multiples of ħ while the intrinsic angular momentum of the neutron and proton are half-integer multiples. It should be immediately apparent that the combination of the intrinsic spins of the nucleons with their orbital motion will always give half-integer values for the total spin, , of any odd-A nucleus and integer values for any even-A nucleus.

Parity with the number is used to label nuclear angular momentum states, examples for some isotopes of hydrogen (H), carbon (C), and sodium (Na) are;

The reason for the unusual fluctuations in , even by differences of just one nucleon, are due to the odd and even numbers of protons and neutrons – pairs of nucleons have a total angular momentum of zero (just like electrons in orbitals), leaving an odd or even number of unpaired nucleons. The property of nuclear spin is an important factor for the operation of NMR spectroscopy in organic chemistry, and MRI in nuclear medicine, due to the nuclear magnetic moment interacting with an external magnetic field.

==Elementary particles==
Elementary particles contain many quantum numbers which are usually said to be intrinsic to them. However, it should be understood that the elementary particles are quantum states of the standard model of particle physics, and hence the quantum numbers of these particles bear the same relation to the Hamiltonian of this model as the quantum numbers of the Bohr atom does to its Hamiltonian. In other words, each quantum number denotes a symmetry of the problem. It is more useful in quantum field theory to distinguish between spacetime and internal symmetries.

Typical quantum numbers related to spacetime symmetries are spin (related to rotational symmetry), the parity, C-parity and T-parity (related to the Poincaré symmetry of spacetime). Typical internal symmetries are lepton number and baryon number or the electric charge. (For a full list of quantum numbers of this kind see the article on flavour.)

==Multiplicative quantum numbers==
Most conserved quantum numbers are additive, so in an elementary particle reaction, the &quot;sum&quot; of the quantum numbers should be the same before and after the reaction. However, some, usually called a &quot;parity&quot;, are multiplicative; i.e., their &quot;product&quot; is conserved. All multiplicative quantum numbers belong to a symmetry (like parity) in which applying the symmetry transformation twice is equivalent to doing nothing (involution).

<text>Ubon Ratchathani (, ) is one of the four major cities of Isan (with Khorat/Nakhon Ratchasima, Udon Thani, and Khon Kaen), also known as the &quot;big four of Isan.&quot; The city is on the Mun River in the southeast of the Isan region of Thailand, and is located away from Bangkok. It is known as Ubon () for short. The full name means &quot;royal lotus city.&quot; Ubon is the administrative center of Ubon Ratchathani Province.

As of 2006, the urban area of Ubon Ratchathani had a population of about 200,000. This included 85,000 in Thetsaban Nakhon Ubon Ratchathani (Ubon municipality), 30,000 each in Thetsaban Mueang Warin Chamrap (Warin municipality) and Thetsaban Tambon Kham Yai, 24,000 in Thetsaban Tambon Saen Suk, and 10,000 each in Thetsaban Tambon Pathum and Tambon Kham Nam Saep, as well as 6,000 in Thetsaban Tambon Ubon.

==History==

The city was founded in the late 18th century by Thao Kham Phong, descendant of Phra Wo and Phra Ta, who escaped from King Siribunsan of Vientiane into the Siam Kingdom during the reign of King Taksin the Great. Later, Thao Kham Phong was appointed to be &quot;&quot; (Thai: พระประทุมวงศา) and the first ruler of Ubon Ratchathani. In 1792, Ubon Ratchathani became a province and was also the administrative center of the Isan monthon. Until 1972, Ubon Ratchathani was the largest province of Thailand by area. Yasothon Province was split off from Ubon Ratchathani Province in 1972, followed by Amnat Charoen Province in 1993. Ubon Ratchathani Province now ranks fifth in area.

The city was attacked by French forces during the 1940 Franco-Thai War.

Ubon grew extensively during World War II when Japanese forces brought in prisoners of war by rail from Kanchanaburi, the survivors of the Burma Railway. One legacy of this is a monument in the city&#x27;s central Thung Si Meuang Park, erected by British prisoners of war in gratitude to the citizens of Ubon Ratchathani for assisting them. During the Vietnam War, United States armed forces constructed Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, which is now also a dual-use commercial airport.

Some of the city&#x27;s religious buildings show the influence of Laotian architecture.

The city has branches of the National Archives of Thailand and National Museum of Thailand.

The world-famous meditation teacher Ajahn Chah, teacher of Ajahn Sumedho, was born in Ubon Ratchathani.

==Geography==
The elevation is . It is from Bangkok.

Ubon Ratchathani sits on the north bank of the Mun River. The south bank of the river is occupied by the suburb of Warin Chamrap (Warin for short), which is effectively incorporated into the city.

==Climate==
Ubon Ratchathani has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;). Winters are dry and very warm. Temperatures rise until April with an average daily maximum of . The monsoon season runs from late April to October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm.

==Festivals==
Ubon Ratchathani is best known for its annual Candle Festival, held in July to mark the beginning of the rainy season retreat for Buddhists, Wan Khao Phansa, also called Buddhist Lent. One day prior, candles are taken to Thung Si Mueang, the central park in the middle of the city; the park is decorated and exhibited in the evening. On the same evening, there are many smaller processions during which candles are carried to practically all Buddhist temples in Thailand. The main procession in Ubon Ratchathani takes place early the next morning. The events are marked by ceremonies and processions in the form of large-scale, colourful parades of magnificent floats with huge, extravagant candlewax sculptures, Thai traditional dance and music.

==Sights and attractions==

The province is known for its strong Buddhist tradition, particularly the practice of monks dwelling in the forest ( &quot;Phra thudong&quot;, pilgrimage, lit. &quot;hiking monk&quot;). Wat Nong Pah Pong, for example, is a Buddhist forest monastery in the Thai Forest Tradition, which was established by Venerable Ajahn Chah Subhaddo in 1954. Ajahn Chah&#x27;s style of teaching and personality had a notable ability to reach people of other nationalities. Many foreigners came to learn from, train under, and be ordained by Ajahn Chah. Wat Pa Nanachat (International Forest Monastery) was established in 1975. It currently has over fifty monks representing twenty-three nationalities.

Other Buddhist temples in and around the city include &quot;Wat Thung Si Muang&quot; (), in the center of the city, featuring an old wooden library on stilts in a small lake, and &quot;Wat Nong Bua&quot; near the Big C mall, featuring a chedi modelled on Bodh Gaya in India.

==Education==
===High schools===
There are two major high schools in the central part of Ubon Ratchathani. These two schools are more than 100 years old.

*Benchama Maharacha School (Thai: เบ็ญจะมะมหาราช), which offers an English language stream.
*Narinukun School, which offers an English language stream.
*Ave Maria School.
*Assumption School, on Chayangkun Road is a private Catholic school.

===Higher education===
*Ubon Ratchathani University, a rural campus south of the city, but accessible by two songthaew routes.
*Ubon Ratchathani Rajabhat University, an upgraded technical college just north of the central city. 
*Ratchathani University, a private university with a large campus between the km5 post on the Ring Road and the Mun River.
*Mahachulalongkorn Ratchawitthayalai University is a Bangkok Buddhist university with a small campus on &quot;Wat Mahawanaram&quot; in the city, and a new and much larger, but isolated campus in Tambon Krasop, northeast of the Ring Road. 
*North Eastern Polytechnic College, with a campus on Chayangkun Road near the Big C Mall. 
*Ubon Polytechnic College, with a campus on Chongkonnithan Road west of the city centre.
*Ratchathani Technology Vocational College, north of the Ring Road on Ubon 2 Road. 
*Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University, while Bangkok-based, operates the small &quot;Sun Witthaya Phatthana Ubon Ratchathani centre&quot; next to the National Archives, a block west of the Ring Road. 
*Ubon Ratchathani Technical College is near SK Mall. 
*Ubon Ratchathani Vocational College, on Phrommarat Road in the city centre. 
*Boromarajonani College of nursing Sappasithipasong, a block east of Sapphasit Prasong hospital.

==Transportation==
===Airport===
As well as being a commercial facility, Ubon Ratchathani Airport (IATA: UBP) is also an active Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) base, the home of 2nd Air Division/21st Wing Air Combat Command. During the Vietnam War, US and Australian squadrons were based here.

===Bus terminal===
The town&#x27;s main bus station is in the northwest of the city, on the Ring Road (Highway 231), west of its intersection with Chayangkun Road (Highway 212) on the outskirts of the city and close to Big C store. Nakhonchai Air operates its own private bus terminal just across from the main bus station.

===Railway terminal===
The eastern terminus of the north-eastern railway line from Hua Lamphong Railway Station, Bangkok&#x27;s central station, is in Warin Chamrap. The rail-head reached Warin in April 1930. The terminal station is called Ubon Ratchathani, but is in Warin Chamrap municipality, which is south of Ubon Ratchathani.

<text>William Hayward Pickering (24 December 1910 – 15 March 2004) was a New Zealand-born aerospace engineer who headed Pasadena, California&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for 22 years, retiring in 1976. He was a senior NASA luminary and pioneered the exploration of space. Pickering was also a founding member of the United States National Academy of Engineering.

==Origins and education==
Born in Wellington, New Zealand, on 24 December 1910, Pickering attended Havelock School (also attended by Ernest Rutherford), Marlborough, and Wellington College. After spending a year at the Canterbury University College, he moved to the United States (where he subsequently naturalized), to complete a bachelor&#x27;s degree at the California Institute of Technology (&quot;Caltech&quot;), and later, in 1936, a PhD in Physics. His speciality was in Electrical Engineering, and he majored in what is now commonly known in scientific vernacular as &#x27;telemetry&#x27;.

==Jet Propulsion Laboratory==
William Pickering became involved with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 1944, during the Second World War.

As the Director of JPL, from 1954, Pickering was closely involved with management of the Private and Corporal missiles under the aegis of the U.S. Army.

His group launched Explorer I on a Jupiter-C rocket from Cape Canaveral on 31 January 1958 less than four months after the Soviet Union had launched Sputnik.

In 1958 the lab&#x27;s projects were transferred to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Pickering&#x27;s team concentrated on NASA&#x27;s unmanned space-flight program. JPL, under Pickering&#x27;s direction flew further Explorer 3 and Pioneer missions as well as the Ranger and Surveyor missions to the moon and the several Mariner flybys of Venus and Mars.

Explorer III discovered the radiation field round the earth that is now known as the Van Allen radiation belt. Explorer 1 orbited for 10 years and was the forerunner of a number of successful JPL earth and deep-space satellites. William Hayward Pickering is not to be confused with William Henry Pickering, an astronomer from an earlier era.

At the time of his retirement as director, in 1976, the Voyager missions were about to launch on tours of the outer planets and Viking 1 was on its way to land on Mars.

==Retirement==
Pickering, keen to support authentic science in his home country, was Patron of New Zealand&#x27;s only school-based research group, the Nexus Research Group, from 1999 until his death in 2004.
Between 1977 and his death in 2004, Pickering also served as Patron of the New Zealand Spaceflight Association; a non-profit organisation that existed from 1977 to 2012 to promote an informed approach to astronautics and related sciences.

==Gifford Observatory==
Pickering re-opened the Gifford Observatory as the guest of honour, on 25 March 2002. He had been a frequent user of the observatory during his school days in Wellington College.

==Death==
Pickering died on 15 March 2004 of pneumonia at his home in La Cañada Flintridge, California, US.

==Honours==
* In 1964, he was awarded the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.
* In 1964 he presented the Bernard Price Memorial Lecture in South Africa.
* 1965 The Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand (IPENZ) Honorary Fellowship
* Magellanic Premium in 1966.
* IEEE Edison Medal in 1972, For contributions to telecommunications, rocket guidance and spacecraft control, and for inspiring leadership in unmanned exploration of the solar system.
* National Medal of Science in 1975 awarded by President Gerald Ford
* Honorary (because of his American citizenship) investiture as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1975
* In 1980 he was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame.
*In 1979, Pickering was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.
* Japan Prize in 1994
* In the 2003 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed an honorary member of the Order of New Zealand, the highest civilian award in the New Zealand honours system.
* Pickering is one of the few non-politicians to have appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine twice.

==Honorific eponyms==
In 2009 to mark the International Year of Astronomy, William Hayward Pickering was selected along with cosmologist Beatrice Tinsley to have their names bestowed on peaks in the Kepler Mountains of New Zealand&#x27;s Fiordland National Park. In December 2010 the New Zealand Geographic Board officially gazetted Mount Pickering as an official New Zealand place name.

Three roads in New Zealand have been named after Pickering, namely: Sir William Pickering Drive in the Canterbury Technology Park in Christchurch; Pickering Crescent in Hamilton; and William Pickering Drive in Auckland.

In December 2018 New Zealand company Rocket Lab announced that the fourth launch of their Electron rocket and their first mission for NASA&#x27;s Educational Launch of Nanosatellites programme will be named &quot;This one&#x27;s for Pickering&quot;, in honour of Bill Pickering.

Minor planet 5738 Billpickering is named in his honour.

<doc id="532427" wikidata="Q217778" url="?curid=532427" title="Aegopodium podagraria">
<text>Aegopodium podagraria, commonly called ground elder, is a species of flowering plant in the carrot family Apiaceae that grows in shady places. The name &quot;ground elder&quot; comes from the superficial similarity of its leaves and flowers to those of elder (&quot;Sambucus&quot;), which is not closely related. Other common names include herb gerard, bishop&#x27;s weed, goutweed, gout wort, snow-in-the-mountain, English masterwort and wild masterwort. It is the type species of the genus &quot;Aegopodium&quot;. It is native to Europe and Asia, but has been introduced around the world as an ornamental plant, where it occasionally poses an ecological threat as an invasive exotic plant.

==Description==
This herbaceous perennial grows to a height of from underground rhizomes. The stems are erect, hollow, and grooved. The upper leaves are ternate, broad and toothed. It flowers in spring and early summer. Numerous flowers are grouped together in an umbrella-shaped flowerhead known as a compound umbel. This is divided into several individual umbels (known as umbellets). Each umbellet has 15 to 20 rays (pedicels) that are each topped with a single, small, five-petaled white flower. These are visited by many types of pollinating insects.

The fruits, produced in late summer and autumn, are small and have long curved styles.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Aegopodium podagraria&quot; is distributed widely in the temperate zone of western Asia and the whole of mainland Europe. It has been introduced elsewhere, including Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia (including Tasmania), New Zealand, and Japan.

== Ecology ==

In Eurasia, it is used as a food plant by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera, including dot moth, grey dagger and grey pug, although &quot;A. podagraria&quot; is not the exclusive host to any of these species.

=== Invasiveness ===
Seed dispersal and seedling establishment are typically limited by shading, and new establishments from seed are restricted to disturbed areas. However &quot;A. podagraria&quot; readily spreads over large areas of ground by underground rhizomes. Once established, the plants are highly competitive, even in shaded environments, and can reduce the diversity of ground cover and prevent the establishment of tree and shrub seedlings. Because of its limited seed dispersal ability, short-lived seed bank and seedling recruitment, the primary vector for dispersal to new areas is human plantings as an ornamental, medicinal or vegetable plant, as well as by accidentally spreading rhizomes by dumping of garden waste. It spreads rapidly under favorable growing conditions. Because of this it has been described as a nuisance species, and been labelled one of the &quot;worst&quot; garden weeds in perennial flower gardens.

==== Status as an invasive exotic plant ====
&quot;Aegopodium podagraria&quot; has been introduced around the world, including in North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, most commonly as an ornamental plant. It readily establishes and can become naturalized in boreal, moist-temperate and moist-subtropical climates. It is an aggressive invader in the upper Great Lakes region and northeastern North America, Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand. It can pose an ecological threat owing to its invasive nature, with potential to crowd out native species. Because of its potential impacts on native communities and the difficulty of controlling it, it has been banned or restricted in some jurisdictions outside its native range, including in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Wisconsin and Vermont in the U.S.

==== Control ====

Once established, goutweed is difficult to eradicate. The smallest piece of rhizome left in the ground will quickly form a sturdy new plant. All-green goutweed may be more persistent and spread more rapidly than ornamental, variegated goutweed varieties, making the all-green type particularly difficult to control. And all-green, wild type forms are known to reappear from seeds of variegated varieties.

Integrative management strategies that combine herbicide with landscape cloth, bark mulch, and hand weeding to control goutweed in a garden are largely unsuccessful because sprouting occurs from either rhizomes or root fragments left in the soil. Hand pulling, raking, and digging followed by monitoring to control goutweed may be effective; however, caution must be taken to remove the entire rhizome and root system. Removing flowers before seed set may help control the spread of goutweed. Because goutweed&#x27;s starch reserves are typically depleted by spring, removal of leaves in spring could be effective in starving the plant. Once goutweed has been removed, the patch should be carefully monitored periodically for a few years. New shoots should be dug up and destroyed. Revegetation with other plant materials is recommended.

Systemic herbicides such as glyphosate are recommended because &quot;A. podagraria&quot; will regrow if merely defoliated.

The most effective means of control is to prevent its establishment in natural communities. It is thus recommended to plant goutweed only on sites not adjacent to wildlands and in gardens where root spread can be restricted (e.g., between a sidewalk and a house). However, the aggressive nature of this plant makes even this strategy risky. Several states have banned sales of goutweed (also known as bishop&#x27;s weed).

== Uses ==
The tender leaves can be utilized as a spring leaf vegetable akin to spinach, having been used thus since antiquity. It is commonly used for soup. Young leaves are preferred as a pot herb. It is best picked from when it appears (as early as February in the UK and other parts of northern Europe) to just before it flowers (May to June). If it is picked after this point it tastes pungent and has a laxative effect. However, it can be stopped from flowering by pinching out the flowers, ensuring the plant remains edible if used more sparingly as a pot herb.

It also had a history as a medicinal herb to treat gout and arthritis, applied in hot wraps externally upon boiling both leaves and roots together. Ingested, the leaves have a diuretic effect and act as a mild sedative. Its use as a medicinal herb has largely declined.

The plant is said to have been introduced into Great Britain by the Romans as a food plant and into Northern Europe as a medicinal herb by monks. It is still found growing in patches surrounding many monastic ruins in Europe, and descriptions of its use are found among monastic writings, such as in &quot;Physica&quot; by Hildegard von Bingen.

As a member of Apiaceae, its flowers may be confused with extremely toxic species such as poison hemlock and hemlock water dropwort; attention to the leaves is required for a conclusive identification.

A variegated form is grown as an ornamental plant. However it is banned in several states owing to its invasiveness. Seeds from the variegated form may revert to the more aggressive green form.

<text>Dawn is a retired space probe that was launched by NASA in September 2007 with the mission of studying two of the three known protoplanets of the asteroid belt: Vesta and Ceres. In the fulfillment of that mission—the ninth in NASA&#x27;s Discovery Program—&quot;Dawn&quot; entered orbit around Vesta on July 16, 2011, and completed a 14-month survey mission before leaving for Ceres in late 2012. It entered orbit around Ceres on March 6, 2015. In 2017, NASA announced that the planned nine-year mission would be extended until the probe&#x27;s hydrazine fuel supply was depleted. On November 1, 2018, NASA announced that &quot;Dawn&quot; had depleted its hydrazine, and the mission was ended. The derelict probe remains in a stable orbit around Ceres.

&quot;Dawn&quot; is the first spacecraft to have orbited two extraterrestrial bodies, the first spacecraft to have visited either Vesta or Ceres, and the first to have orbited a dwarf planet.

The &quot;Dawn&quot; mission was managed by NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with spacecraft components contributed by European partners from Italy, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. It was the first NASA exploratory mission to use ion propulsion, which enabled it to enter and leave the orbit of two celestial bodies. Previous multi-target missions using rockets powered by chemical engines, such as the &quot;Voyager&quot; program, were restricted to flybys.

==Project history==

===Technological background===

The first working ion thruster in the US was built by Harold R. Kaufman in 1959 at NASA&#x27;s Glenn Research Center in Ohio. The thruster was similar to the general design of a gridded electrostatic ion thruster with mercury as its propellant. Suborbital tests of the engine followed during the 1960s, and in 1964 the engine was tested on a suborbital flight aboard the Space Electric Rocket Test 1 (SERT 1). It successfully operated for the planned 31 minutes before falling back to Earth. This test was followed by an orbital test, SERT-2, in 1970.

Deep Space 1 (DS1), which NASA launched in 1998, demonstrated the long-duration use of a xenon-propelled ion thruster on a science mission, and validated a number of technologies, including the NSTAR electrostatic ion thruster, as well as performing a flyby of an asteroid and a comet. In addition to the ion thruster, among the other technologies validated by the DS1 was the Small Deep Space Transponder, which is used on &quot;Dawn&quot; for long-range communication.

===Discovery Program selection===
Twenty-six proposals were submitted to the Discovery Program solicitation, with budget initially targeted at US$300 million. Three semi-finalists were downselected in January 2001 for a phase-A design study: Dawn, Kepler, and INSIDE Jupiter. In December 2001 NASA selected the Kepler and the Dawn mission for the Discovery program. Both missions were initially selected for a launch in 2006.

===Cancellation and reinstatement===
The status of the &quot;Dawn&quot; mission changed several times. The project was cancelled in December 2003, and then reinstated in February 2004. In October 2005, work on &quot;Dawn&quot; was placed in &quot;stand down&quot; mode, and in January 2006, the mission was discussed in the press as &quot;indefinitely postponed&quot;, even though NASA had made no new announcements regarding its status. On March 2, 2006, &quot;Dawn&quot; was again cancelled by NASA.

The spacecraft&#x27;s manufacturer, Orbital Sciences Corporation, appealed NASA&#x27;s decision, offering to build the spacecraft at cost, forgoing any profit in order to gain experience in a new market field. NASA then put the cancellation under review, and on March 27, 2006, it was announced that the mission would not be cancelled after all. In the last week of September 2006, the &quot;Dawn&quot; mission&#x27;s instrument payload integration reached full functionality. Although originally projected to cost US$373 million, cost overruns inflated the final cost of the mission to US$446 million in 2007. Christopher T. Russell was chosen to lead the &quot;Dawn&quot; mission team.

==Scientific background==

The &quot;Dawn&quot; mission was designed to study two large bodies in the asteroid belt in order to answer questions about the formation of the Solar System, as well as to test the performance of its ion thrusters in deep space. Ceres and Vesta were chosen as two contrasting protoplanets, the first one apparently &quot;wet&quot; (i.e. icy and cold) and the other &quot;dry&quot; (i.e. rocky), whose accretion was terminated by the formation of Jupiter. The two bodies provide a bridge in scientific understanding between the formation of rocky planets and the icy bodies of the Solar System, and under what conditions a rocky planet can hold water.

The International Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted a new definition of planet on August 24, 2006, which introduced the term &quot;dwarf planet&quot; for ellipsoidal worlds that were too small to qualify for planetary status by &quot;clearing their orbital neighborhood&quot; of other orbiting matter. &quot;Dawn&quot; is the first mission to study a dwarf planet, arriving at Ceres a few months before the arrival of the &quot;New Horizons&quot; probe at Pluto in July 2015.
Ceres comprises a third of the total mass of the asteroid belt. Its spectral characteristics suggest a composition similar to that of a water-rich carbonaceous chondrite. Vesta, a smaller, water-poor achondritic asteroid comprising a tenth of the mass of the asteroid belt, has experienced significant heating and differentiation. It shows signs of a metallic core, a Mars-like density and lunar-like basaltic flows.

Available evidence indicates that both bodies formed very early in the history of the Solar System, thereby retaining a record of events and processes from the time of the formation of the terrestrial planets. Radionuclide dating of pieces of meteorites thought to come from Vesta suggests that Vesta differentiated quickly, in three million years or less. Thermal evolution studies suggest that Ceres must have formed some time later, more than three million years after the formation of CAIs (the oldest known objects of Solar System origin).

Moreover, Vesta appears to be the source of many smaller objects in the Solar System. Most (but not all) V-type near-Earth asteroids, and some outer main-belt asteroids, have spectra similar to Vesta, and are thus known as &quot;vestoids&quot;. Five percent of the meteoritic samples found on Earth, the howardite–eucrite–diogenite (HED) meteorites, are thought to be the result of a collision or collisions with Vesta.

It is thought that Ceres may have a differentiated interior; its oblateness appears too small for an undifferentiated body, which indicates that it consists of a rocky core overlain with an icy mantle. There is a large collection of potential samples from Vesta accessible to scientists, in the form of over 1,400 HED meteorites, giving insight into Vesta geologic history and structure. Vesta is thought to consist of a metallic iron–nickel core, an overlying rocky olivine mantle and crust.
==Objectives==
The &quot;Dawn&quot; mission&#x27;s goal was to characterize the conditions and processes of the Solar System&#x27;s earliest eon by investigating in detail two of the largest protoplanets remaining intact since their formation.

Although the mission has finished, the data analyses and interpretations will continue for many years. The primary question that the mission addresses is the role of size and water in determining the evolution of the planets. Ceres and Vesta are highly suitable bodies with which to address this question, as they are two of the most massive of the protoplanets. Ceres is geologically very primitive and icy, while Vesta is evolved and rocky. Their contrasting characteristics are thought to have resulted from them forming in two different regions of the early Solar System.

There are three principal scientific drivers for the mission. First, the &quot;Dawn&quot; mission can capture the earliest moments in the origin of the Solar System, granting an insight into the conditions under which these objects formed. Second, &quot;Dawn&quot; determines the nature of the building blocks from which the terrestrial planets formed, improving scientific understanding of this formation. Finally, it contrasts the formation and evolution of two small planets that followed very different evolutionary paths, allowing scientists to determine what factors control that evolution.

==Instruments==

NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory provided overall planning and management of the mission, the flight system and scientific payload development, and provided the ion propulsion system. Orbital Sciences Corporation provided the spacecraft, which constituted the company&#x27;s first interplanetary mission. The Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) provided the framing cameras, the Italian Space Agency provided the mapping spectrometer, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory provided the gamma ray and neutron spectrometer.

*Framing camera (FC) – Two redundant framing camera were flown. Each used a f/7.9 refractive optical system with a focal length of 150 mm. A frame-transfer charge-coupled device (CCD), a Thomson TH7888A, at the focal plane has 1024 × 1024 sensitive 93-μrad pixels, imaging a 5.5° x 5.5° field of view. An 8-position filter wheel permits panchromatic (clear filter) and spectrally selective imaging (7 narrow band filters). The broadest filter allows imaging at wavelengths from 400 to 1050 nm. The FC computer is a custom radiation-hardened Xilinx system with a LEON2 core and 8 GiB of memory. The camera offered resolutions of 17 m/pixel for Vesta and 66 m/pixel for Ceres. Because the framing camera was vital for both science and navigation, the payload had two identical and physically separate cameras (FC1 &amp; FC2) for redundancy, each with its own optics, electronics, and structure.
*Visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR) – This instrument is a modification of the visible and infrared thermal-imaging spectrometer used on the &quot;Rosetta&quot; and &quot;Venus Express&quot; spacecraft. It draws its heritage from the Saturn orbiter &quot;Cassini&quot;″s visible and infrared mapping spectrometer. The spectrometer&#x27;s VIR spectral frames are 256 (spatial) × 432 (spectral), and the slit length is 64 mrad. The mapping spectrometer incorporates two channels, both fed by a single grating. A CCD yields frames from 0.25 to 1.0 μm, while an array of HgCdTe photodiodes cooled to about 70 K spans the spectrum from 0.95 to 5.0 μm.
*Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector (GRaND) – This instrument is based on similar instruments flown on the Lunar Prospector and Mars Odyssey space missions. It had 21 sensors with a very wide field of view. It was used to measure the abundances of the major rock-forming elements (oxygen, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, calcium, titanium, and iron) and potassium, thorium, uranium, and water (inferred from hydrogen content) in the top 1 m of the surface of Vesta and Ceres.

A magnetometer and laser altimeter were considered for the mission, but were not ultimately flown.

==Specifications==
===Dimensions===
With its solar array in the retracted launch position, the &quot;Dawn&quot; spacecraft is wide. With its solar arrays fully extended, &quot;Dawn&quot; is wide. The solar arrays have a total area of . The main antenna is five feet (1.24 metres) in diameter.

===Propulsion system===
The &quot;Dawn&quot; spacecraft was propelled by three xenon ion thrusters derived from NSTAR technology used by the &quot;Deep Space 1&quot; spacecraft, using one at a time. They have a specific impulse of 3,100 s and produce a thrust of 90 mN. The whole spacecraft, including the ion propulsion thrusters, was powered by a 10 kW (at 1 AU) triple-junction gallium arsenide photovoltaic solar array manufactured by Dutch Space. &quot;Dawn&quot; was allocated of xenon for its Vesta approach, and carried another to reach Ceres, out of a total capacity of of on-board propellant. With the propellant it carried, &quot;Dawn&quot; was able to perform a velocity change of approximately 11 km/s over the course of its mission, far more than any previous spacecraft achieved with onboard propellant after separation from its launch rocket. However, the thrust was very gentle; it took four days at full throttle to accelerate &quot;Dawn&quot; from zero to 60 mph (96 km/h). 
&quot;Dawn&quot; is NASA&#x27;s first purely exploratory mission to use ion propulsion engines. The spacecraft also has twelve 0.9 N hydrazine thrusters for attitude control (orientation), which were also used to assist in orbital insertion.

The Dawn spacecraft was able to achieve a record-breaking level of propulsion from its ion engine. NASA noted three specific areas of excellence: 
*First to orbit two different astronomical bodies (not including Earth).
*Solar-electric propulsion record, including a velocity change in space of 25,700 mph (11.49 km/s). This is 2.7 times the velocity change by solar-electric ion drive than the past record.
*Achieved 5.9 years of ion engine runtime by September 7, 2018. This amount of runtime equates to 54% of Dawn&#x27;s time in outer space.

===Outreach microchip===
&quot;Dawn&quot; carries a memory chip bearing the names of more than 360,000 space enthusiasts. The names were submitted online as part of a public outreach effort between September 2005 and November 4, 2006. The microchip, which is two centimetres in diameter, was installed on May 17, 2007, above the spacecraft&#x27;s forward ion thruster, underneath its high-gain antenna. More than one microchip was made, with a back-up copy put on display at the 2007 Open House event at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

==Mission summary==

===Launch preparations===
On April 10, 2007, the spacecraft arrived at the Astrotech Space Operations subsidiary of SPACEHAB, Inc. in Titusville, Florida, where it was prepared for launch. The launch was originally scheduled for June 20, but was delayed until June 30 due to delays with part deliveries. A broken crane at the launch pad, used to raise the solid rocket boosters, further delayed the launch for a week, until July 7; prior to this, on June 15, the second stage was successfully hoisted into position. A mishap at the Astrotech Space Operations facility, involving slight damage to one of the solar arrays, did not have an effect on the launch date; however, bad weather caused the launch to slip to July 8. Range tracking problems then delayed the launch to July 9, and then July 15. Launch planning was then suspended in order to avoid conflicts with the &quot;Phoenix&quot; mission to Mars, which was successfully launched on August 4.

===Launch===

The launch of &quot;Dawn&quot; was rescheduled for September 26, 2007, then September 27, due to bad weather delaying fueling of the second stage, the same problem that delayed the July 7 launch attempt. The launch window extended from 07:20–07:49 EDT (11:20–11:49 GMT). During the final built-in hold at T−4 minutes, a ship entered the exclusion area offshore, the strip of ocean where the rocket boosters were likely to fall after separation. After commanding the ship to leave the area, the launch was required to wait for the end of a collision avoidance window with the International Space Station. &quot;Dawn&quot; finally launched from pad 17-B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on a Delta 7925-H rocket at 07:34 EDT, reaching escape velocity with the help of a spin-stabilized solid-fueled third stage. Thereafter, &quot;Dawn&#x27;s&quot; ion thrusters took over.

===Transit to Vesta===
After initial testing, during which the ion thrusters accumulated more than 11 days 14 hours of operation, &quot;Dawn&quot; began long-term cruise propulsion on December 17, 2007. On October 31, 2008, &quot;Dawn&quot; completed its first thrusting phase to send it on to Mars for a gravity assist flyby in February 2009. During this first interplanetary cruise phase, &quot;Dawn&quot; spent 270 days, or 85% of this phase, using its thrusters. It expended less than 72 kilograms of xenon propellant for a total change in velocity of 1.81 km/s. On November 20, 2008, &quot;Dawn&quot; performed its first trajectory correction maneuver (TCM1), firing its number 1 thruster for 2 hours, 11 minutes.

&quot;Dawn&quot; made its closest approach (549 km) to Mars on February 17, 2009, during a successful gravity assist. This flyby slowed Mars&#x27;s orbital velocity by about per 180 million years. On this day, the spacecraft placed itself in safe mode, resulting in some data acquisition loss. The spacecraft was reported to be back in full operation two days later, with no impact on the subsequent mission identified. The root cause of the event was reported to be a software programming error.

To cruise from Earth to its targets, &quot;Dawn&quot; travelled in an elongated outward spiral trajectory. The actual Vesta chronology and estimated Ceres chronology are as follows:
*September 27, 2007: launch
*February 17, 2009: Mars gravity assist
*July 16, 2011: Vesta arrival and capture
*August 11–31, 2011: Vesta survey orbit
*September 29 – November 2, 2011: Vesta first high altitude orbit
*December 12, 2011 – May 1, 2012: Vesta low altitude orbit
*June 15 – July 25, 2012: Vesta second high altitude orbit
*September 5, 2012: Vesta departure
*March 6, 2015: Ceres arrival
*June 30, 2016: End of primary Ceres operations
*July 1, 2016: Beginning of Ceres extended mission
*November 1, 2018: End of Mission

===Vesta approach===
As &quot;Dawn&quot; approached Vesta, the Framing Camera instrument took progressively higher-resolution images, which were published online and at news conferences by NASA and MPI.

On May 3, 2011, &quot;Dawn&quot; acquired its first targeting image, 1,200,000 km from Vesta, and began its approach phase to the asteroid. On June 12, &quot;Dawn&#x27;s&quot; speed relative to Vesta was slowed in preparation for its orbital insertion 34 days later.

&quot;Dawn&quot; was scheduled to be inserted into orbit at 05:00 UTC on July 16 after a period of thrusting with its ion engines. Because its antenna was pointed away from the Earth during thrusting, scientists were not able to immediately confirm whether or not &quot;Dawn&quot; successfully made the maneuver. The spacecraft would then reorient itself, and was scheduled to check in at 06:30 UTC on July 17. NASA later confirmed that it received telemetry from &quot;Dawn&quot; indicating that the spacecraft successfully entered orbit around Vesta, making it the first spacecraft to orbit an object in the asteroid belt. The exact time of insertion could not be confirmed, since it depended on Vesta&#x27;s mass distribution, which was not precisely known and at that time had only been estimated.

===Vesta orbit===
After being captured by Vesta&#x27;s gravity and entering its orbit on July 16, 2011, &quot;Dawn&quot; moved to a lower, closer orbit by running its xenon-ion engine using solar power. On August 2, it paused its spiralling approach to enter a 69-hour survey orbit at an altitude of . It assumed a 12.3-hour high-altitude mapping orbit at on September 27, and finally entered a 4.3-hour low-altitude mapping orbit at on December 8.

In May 2012, the &quot;Dawn&quot; team published preliminary results of their study of Vesta, including estimates of the size of Vesta&#x27;s metal-rich core, which is theorized to be across. The scientists stated that they think that Vesta is the &quot;last of its kind&quot; – the only remaining example of the large planetoids that came together to form the rocky planets during the formation of the Solar System. In October 2012, further &quot;Dawn&quot; results were published, on the origin of anomalous dark spots and streaks on Vesta&#x27;s surface, which were likely deposited by ancient asteroid impacts. In December 2012, it was reported that &quot;Dawn&quot; had observed gullies on the surface of Vesta that were interpreted to have been eroded by transiently flowing liquid water. More details about the &quot;Dawn&quot; mission&#x27;s scientific discoveries at Vesta are included on the Vesta page.

&quot;Dawn&quot; was originally scheduled to depart Vesta and begin its two and a half year journey to Ceres on August 26, 2012. However, a problem with one of the spacecraft&#x27;s reaction wheels forced &quot;Dawn&quot; to delay its departure from Vesta&#x27;s gravity until September 5, 2012.

===Transit to Ceres===

During its time in orbit around Vesta, the probe experienced several failures of its reaction wheels. Investigators planned to modify their activities upon arrival at Ceres for close range geographical survey mapping. The &quot;Dawn&quot; team stated that they would orient the probe using a &quot;hybrid&quot; mode utilizing both reaction wheels and ion thrusters. Engineers determined that this hybrid mode would conserve fuel. On November 13, 2013, during the transit, in a test preparation, &quot;Dawn&quot; engineers completed a 27-hour-long series of exercises of said hybrid mode.

On September 11, 2014, &quot;Dawn&quot; ion thruster unexpectedly ceased firing and the probe began operating in a triggered safe mode. To avoid a lapse in propulsion, the mission team hastily exchanged the active ion engine and electrical controller with another. The team stated that they had a plan in place to revive this disabled component later in 2014. The controller in the ion propulsion system may have been damaged by a high-energy particle. Upon exiting the safe mode on September 15, 2014, the probe&#x27;s ion thruster resumed normal operation.

Furthermore, the &quot;Dawn&quot; investigators also found that, after the propulsion issue, &quot;Dawn&quot; could not aim its main communications antenna towards Earth. Another antenna of weaker capacity was instead temporarily retasked. To correct the problem, the probe&#x27;s computer was reset and the aiming mechanism of the main antenna was restored.

===Ceres approach===
&quot;Dawn&quot; began photographing an extended disk of Ceres on December 1, 2014, with images of partial rotations on January 13 and 25, 2015 released as animations.
Images taken from &quot;Dawn&quot; of Ceres after January 26, 2015, exceeded the resolution of comparable images from the Hubble Space Telescope.

Progression of images of Ceres taken by &quot;Dawn&quot; between January and March 2015
Because of the failure of two reaction wheels, &quot;Dawn&quot; made fewer camera observations of Ceres during its approach phase than it did during its Vesta approach. Camera observations required turning the spacecraft, which consumed precious hydrazine fuel. Seven optical navigation photo sessions (OpNav 1–7, on January 13 and 25, February 3 and 25, March 1, and April 10 and 15) and two full rotation observation sessions (RC1–2, on February 12 and 19) were planned before full observation begins with orbital capture. The gap in March and early April was due to a period when Ceres appears too close to the Sun from &quot;Dawn&quot; vantage point to take pictures safely.

===Ceres orbit===

&quot;Dawn&quot; entered Ceres orbit on March 6, 2015, four months prior to the arrival of &quot;New Horizons&quot; at Pluto. &quot;Dawn&quot; thus became the first mission to study a dwarf planet at close range. &quot;Dawn&quot; initially entered a polar orbit around Ceres, and continued to refine its orbit. It obtained its first full topographic map of Ceres during this period.

From April 23 to May 9, 2015, &quot;Dawn&quot; entered an RC3 orbit (Rotation Characterization 3) at an altitude of . The RC3 orbit lasted 15 days, during which &quot;Dawn&quot; alternated taking pictures and sensor measurements and then relayed the resulting data back to Earth. On May 9, 2015, &quot;Dawn&quot; powered its ion engines and began a month-long spiral descent down to its second mapping point, a Survey orbit, three times closer to Ceres than the previous orbit. The spacecraft stopped twice to take images of Ceres during its spiral descent into the new orbit.

On June 6, 2015, &quot;Dawn&quot; entered the new Survey orbit at an altitude of . In the new Survey orbit, &quot;Dawn&quot; circled Ceres every three Earth days. The Survey phase lasted 22 days (7 orbits), and was designed to obtain a global view of Ceres with &quot;Dawn&quot; framing camera, and generate detailed global maps with the visible and infrared mapping spectrometer (VIR).

On June 30, 2015, &quot;Dawn&quot; experienced a software glitch when an anomaly in its orientation system occurred. It responded by going into safe mode and sending a signal to engineers, who fixed the error on July 2, 2015. Engineers determined the cause of the anomaly to be related to the mechanical gimbal system associated with one of &quot;Dawn&#x27;s&quot; ion engines. After switching to a separate ion engine and conducting tests from July 14 through July 16, 2015, engineers certified the ability to continue the mission.

On August 17, 2015, &quot;Dawn&quot; entered the HAMO orbit (High-Altitude Mapping Orbit). &quot;Dawn&quot; descended to an altitude of , where in August 2015 it began the two-month HAMO phase. During this phase, &quot;Dawn&quot; continued to acquire near-global maps with the VIR and framing camera at higher resolution than in the Survey phase. It also imaged in stereo to resolve the surface in 3D.

On October 23, 2015, &quot;Dawn&quot; began a two-month spiral toward Ceres to achieve a LAMO orbit (Low-Altitude Mapping Orbit) at a distance of . Since reaching this fourth orbit in December 2015, &quot;Dawn&quot; was scheduled to acquire data for the next three months with its gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND) and other instruments that identified the composition at the surface.

Having surpassed its mapping objectives, &quot;Dawn&quot; climbed to its fifth science orbit of beginning on September 2, 2016, to complete additional observations from a different angle. &quot;Dawn&quot; began raising its altitude to its sixth science orbit of on November 4, 2016, with a goal of reaching it by December 2016. The return to a higher altitude allowed for a second set of data at this altitude, which improves the overall science quality when added to the first batch. However, this time the spacecraft was placed where it was not spiraling and was orbiting in the same direction as Ceres, which reduced propellant consumption.

==Mission conclusion==
A flyby of the asteroid 2 Pallas after the completion of the Ceres mission was suggested but never formally considered; orbiting Pallas would not have been possible for &quot;Dawn&quot; due to the high inclination of Pallas&#x27;s orbit relative to Ceres.

In April 2016, the &quot;Dawn&quot; project team submitted a proposal to NASA for an extended mission that would have seen the spacecraft break orbit from Ceres and perform a flyby of the asteroid 145 Adeona in May 2019, arguing that the science gained from visiting a third asteroid might outweigh the returns from staying at Ceres. NASA&#x27;s Planetary Mission Senior Review Panel, however, declined the proposal in May 2016. A one-year mission extension was approved, but the review panel ordered that &quot;Dawn&quot; remain at Ceres, stating that the long-term observations of the dwarf planet, particularly as it approached perihelion, would potentially yield better science.

The one-year extension expired on June 30, 2017. The spacecraft was placed in an uncontrolled but relatively stable orbit around Ceres, where it ran out of hydrazine propellant by October 31, 2018, and where it will remain as a &quot;monument&quot; for at least 20 years.

<doc id="532437" wikidata="Q2735277" url="?curid=532437" title="Prem Nazir">
<text>Prem Nazir (born Abdul Khader; 06 April 1926 – 16 January 1989) was an Indian actor known as one of Malayalam cinema&#x27;s definitive leading men of his generation. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential actors in the history of Indian cinema. A popular cultural icon of Kerala, Nazir is often referred to as Nithyaharitha Nayakan (&quot;Evergreen Hero&quot;). Nazir began his career as a stage actor and made his film debut with the 1952 film &quot;Marumakal&quot;. He took on the stage name Prem Nazir on the sets of his second film, &quot;Visappinte Vili&quot; (1952).

Nazir is noted for his performances in films such as &quot;Murappennu&quot; (1965), &quot;Udhyogastha&quot; (1967), &quot;Iruttinte Athmavu&quot; (1967), &quot;Kallichellamma&quot; (1969), &quot;Virunnukari&quot; (1969), &quot;Nadhi&quot; (1969), &quot;C.I.D. Nazir&quot; (1971), &quot;Anubhavangal Paalichakal&quot; (1971), &quot;Taxi Car&quot; (1972), &quot;Azhakulla Saleena&quot; (1973), &quot;Nellu&quot; (1974), &quot;Ariyappedatha Rahasyam&quot; (1981), &quot;Vida Parayum Munpe&quot; (1981), &quot;Padayottam&quot; (1982), and &quot;Dhwani&quot; (1988). Nazir won the Kerala State Film Award (Special Jury Award) for his role as Madhavan Kutty in &quot;Vida Parayum Munpe&quot;. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan the third highest civilian honours respectively, for his contribution towards the arts. He died due to measles on 16 January 1989 at the age of 62. 

Nazir holds the Guinness World Records for playing opposite the same heroine in 130 films (with Sheela), and previously held the record for playing the lead role in a record 720 films. He also holds two other acting records; for acting opposite eighty heroines and for acting in lead roles in 30 films which were released in a single year (1973 and 1977).

==Early life==

Nazir was born in Chirayinkeezhu in the princely state of Travancore (now in Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala), to Akkode Shahul Hamid and Asuma Beevi on 06 April 1926 in a Rowther family. He had two brothers - Prem Nawas (Abdul Wahab) - and Ashraf and six sisters - Sulekha, Arifa, Aneesa, Umaiba, Sunaisa and Suhara. His mother died when he was very young, and his father remarried a woman of the same name. He completed his formal education from Kadinamkulam Lower Primary School, Sri Chithiravilasam School, Thiruvananthapuram, Sanatana Dharma College, Alappuzha, and St. Berchmans College, Changanassery. By the time he completed his education, he had become an experienced drama artist.

==Career==

===Entry into cinema===
Prem Nazir had his acting debut as Shylock in the play &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (1951), when he was a student at SB College, Changanacherry. He won the best actor award for this role in the play directed by an English Professor of SB College, Prof. C A. Sheppard. His first film was &quot;Marumakal&quot; (1952), directed by S. K. Chari and produced by Paul Kallungal. He was credited as Abdul Khader in this film. He got his career break with &quot;Visappinte Vili&quot; (1952), his second film, made for K&amp;K Combines (Udaya Studio) by Telugu director Mohan Rao. It was on the set of this movie he was renamed to Prem Nazir by Thikkurussi Sukumaran Nair. Prem Nazir started his career when drama was the most popular visual medium and film making at its infancy. He began acting for the Excel Productions (Udaya Studio) and most of his films were for the Udaya and Merryland Studios.

===1950s: Rise to stardom===

With the arrival of Nazir, there was a new screen personality, a new debonair actor who could be a youth heart throb. Prem Nazir acquired the halo of a romantic hero and a loyal following. His tear-jerkers were very popular with female audiences and soon made him a darling of the masses. He became the first real star of Malayalam cinema. Another factor that assisted Prem Nazir&#x27;s rise – as it had the rise of his contemporaries in other regional film industries – was the continuing reign of mythologicals and devotionals. Costumed musicals, filmed start-to-finish within the confines of a studio, contributed their own. All such films for a long period kept him before his fans, nourished his romantic image and provided him unlimited scope for rehearsing and refining his talent in playing diverse roles. Since the bulk of South Indian cinema was theatrical visually and aurally, Prem Nazir&#x27;s stage background and his extraordinary command of Malayalam helped him win the hearts of his audience.

===1960s, 1970s: Golden years===

In the late 1950s, Nazir drew attention by playing movies with themes based on social and religious injustices in the society. From 1956 to 1976, Prem Nazir rode high at the crest of a tidal wave of popularity and also gave his best to Malayalam cinema. Nazir catapulted to the row of the finest actors of India with the film &quot;Iruttinte Athmavu&quot; (1967). Playing a demented youth – Velayadhan, Prem Nazir discovered his prowess as a dramatic actor of great intensity. Many critics have evaluated this role as his masterpiece, and as one of the finest onscreen performances ever. Written by M. T. Vasudevan Nair, the film provided Malayalam cinema with a new direction; that of the low-budget film. One could see a lot of the pre-occupations of the scenarist, who carried the touches of human relationships through all of his subsequent films whether as screenplay writer or director. In spite of its large number of studio shots and overall theatricality, the film was so culturally rich that many of the episodes would become archetypes for future Malayalam film makers dealing with family drama. It depicted the story of an imbecile (finely portrayed by Prem Nazir) in a joint family with remarkable sensitivity and seriousness of purpose.

During his peak time, Nazir gave life to many characters and enjoyed a wide popularity among all sects of the society. He acted in the first-ever investigative series in Malayalam cinema &quot;C.I.D. Nazir&quot; directed by P. Venu. He has played historical characters based on &quot;Vadakkan Pattukal&quot;. &quot;Aromalunni&quot;, &quot;Kannappanunni&quot;, &quot;Thacholi Ambu&quot; and &quot;Padayottam&quot; are some major films in this genre. Although the actor faced criticism for playing such roles as his physique was least suited for it, he still enjoyed a huge fan following among the audiences. He was well known for his roles as Hindu deities like Rama, Krishna and Ayyappa. In his movies, Nazir was well known for playing the eternal romantic hero and the good guy who would bash up the villains without remorse.

Even though Nazir could not regenerate after the mid-1970s, he maintained his superstardom till the beginning of the 1980s. In 1979, 39 of his films got released; a record. He also holds the record for having acted in the most leading roles – about 700 films (with 85 heroines; another record). Another record is for the most enduring screen team along with actress Sheela. They played opposite each other in 130 movies by 1975. Although Sheela is known as the lucky mascot of Prem Nazir, his movies with other heroines like Jayabharathi and Sharada were also big successes at box office. Prem Nazir pairing with comedian Adoor Bhasi was a sure-fire laugh riot. The void left by this duo is yet to be occupied. Nazir&#x27;s association with playback singer K. J. Yesudas was perfect for the audience. Even today many consider the Nazir – Yesudas combination of song sequences remain the best ever on screen. He is quite popularly described as Nithyaharithanayakan (The Evergreen Hero), which does justice to the fact that he was acting as the hero in his elder years as well. Senior Malayalam cine actress Kaviyoor Ponnamma has revealed that Prem Nazir was a very good singer, and had training in Carnatic music.

===1980s: Late career===

By the beginning of the 1980s, Nazir himself moved into supporting roles. He mostly played supporting roles with Jayan, Sukumaran, Shankar and Soman. In 1980, he acted in &quot;Ariyappedatha Rahasyam&quot; directed by P. Venu along with Jayan. In 1981, he played a major supporting role in Mohan&#x27;s &quot;Vida Parayum Munpe&quot; that earned him the Kerala State Special Jury Award. His most iconic role till date came in the form of Padayottam released in 1982. Based loosely on the evergreen classic, The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, Nazir played the titular role of Thamban, a prince who is cheated by his so called dear ones and friends and made a slave in a vessel. How he returns and hunts down those who were responsible for wrecking his life forms the crux of the story. He played his last hero role in &quot;Vellarikka Pattanam&quot; (1985) along with Ratheesh. It is also reputed the Nazir missed the National award for best actor by just one vote for role. His second last film was &quot;Ayalvasi Oru Daridravasi&quot;(1986), where he starred with Mukesh, Shankar, Nedumudi Venu, Sukumari and Seema. His last completed film was A. T. Abu&#x27;s &quot;Dhwani&quot; (1988), in which he co-starred with Jayaram. His last release was Priyadarshan&#x27;s &quot;Kadathanadan Ambadi&quot; (1990), in which he co-starred with Mohanlal. In one of his last interviews, he had expressed a desire to direct a film with Mammootty and Mohanlal in the lead.

===Popular film genres===
Two popular film series initiated by Prem Nazir are the C.I.D series and the Vadakkanpattu series. The former is a group of investigative films by P. Venu in which Nazir played James Bond like protagonists. In most of these movies Nazir teamed with Adoor Bhasi, a famed comedy actor who would accompany Nazir characters in investigations. &quot;C.I.D. Nazir&quot; directed by P. Venu, has inspired numerous adaptations and similar series like for example popular CBI series with Mammootty in the lead and a satirical CID series of Mohanlal-Sreenivasan team. Other inspired films are &quot;C.I.D Unnikrishnan&quot; starring Jayaram and &quot;C.I.D Moosa&quot; with Dileep in the lead.

Another film series starring Nazir was a series of movies based on Vadakanpaattu which are part of the traditional folklore of Kerala. These are tales of martial warriors spread over generations through folk songs. Although the series may have been initiated by Sathyan&#x27;s title role in &quot;Thacholi Othenan&quot;, the trend was continued long after his demise with Nazir in the lead, playing various other characters from Vadakkanpattu.

==Personal life==

===Family===
Prem Nazir was married to Habeeba Beevi and they have one son and three daughters. Laila, Rasiya – both older than Shanavas. The youngest daughter is Rita. Shanavas&#x27;s wife Ayisha Beevi is the daughter of the eldest sister of Prem Nazir, Suleikha Beevi. Prem Nazir&#x27;s son Shanavas acted in few films as well but could not succeed like his father. Third generation of Prem Nazir, Shanavas&#x27;s son Shameer Khan, acted in a Malayalam film, &quot;Uppukandam Brothers Back in Action&quot;.

Prem Nazir&#x27;s younger brother Prem Nawas (Abdul Wahab) also acted in a few films. Although he was the first in the family to begin acting in movies, he later began producing films – &quot;Agniputhri, Thulaavarsham, Poojakku Edukatha Pookkal, Neethi&quot; and &quot;Keni&quot;, to name a few. Prem Nawas&#x27;s only son, Prem Kishore has also had a stint with the industry by acting in two Malayalam films – &quot;Vacation&quot; and &quot;Thaskaraputran&quot;. Prem Nawas has the distinction of acting in the first ever colour film made in Malayalam – &quot;Kandam Becha Kottu&quot;.
===Philanthropic work===
Prem Nazir, renowned for both his acting prowess and philanthropic endeavors, remains a subject of debate on whether he excelled more as an actor or humanitarian. Widely regarded for his generosity, Nazir treated colleagues, well-wishers, and family with equal kindness. His humanitarian impact became evident posthumously as beneficiaries of his assistance came to light. Nazir&#x27;s compassion extended to supporting his close friend Jayan, financing the transportation of Jayan&#x27;s remains following a tragic accident during the shoot of &quot;Kolilakkam.&quot;

Notably, Nazir played a pivotal role in promoting his film colleagues, demonstrating a sharp memory by instantly recognizing individuals. Collaborating with director M. Sasikumar, he assisted bankrupt producers, aiding them in regaining their prominence in the film industry. Nazir&#x27;s golden era in Malayalam cinema was characterized by his unparalleled generosity, where he not only contributed to his own success but also facilitated the growth of others in the industry.

Beyond his cinematic achievements, Nazir donated an elephant to the Sarkara Devi Temple in Chirayinkil and authored books such as &quot;Enne Thediyethiya Kathapatrangal&quot; detailing the film characters he portrayed and his autobiography, &quot;Anubhvangal Oarmakal.&quot; Director and lyricist Sreekumaran Thampi further honored Nazir with the book &quot;Prem Nazir Enna Prema Ganam.

===Death===

It was during the late 1980s, during a time that Nazir campaigned rigorously for a running candidate in politics, he was admitted to Vijaya Hospital due to duodenal ulcer. Unfortunately, during treatment he contracted measles, which caused his condition to deteriorate further. Nazir died in the early hours of 16 January 1989, aged 62. His body was transported to Thiruvananthapuram, where he was buried at Kattumurakkal Juma Masjid, Chirayinkizhil with full state honours.

==Awards==
Prem Nazir won his only Kerala State Film Award in 1981; He won Filmfare Special Award - South for numerous films in 1976 and he won a Special Jury Award for the supporting role he played in the film &quot;Vida Parayum Munbe&quot;. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1983 by the President of India in recognition of distinguished services of a high order to the nation in his field (acting). The Prem Nazir Award was initiated in his memory, in 1992, for excellence in contributions to the Malayalam cinema Industry. He has also held the position of National Film Award jury in 1985.

==Legacy and influence==
Prem Nazir is known to be the most influential and trendsetting lead actor in Malayalam. He is known for his amazing longevity in that he was active during the peak years of other iconic Malayalam superstars like Sathyan and Jayan acting alongside them in 1960s and 1970s respectively. Nazir who began his movie career in the early 1950s, later acted alongside popular future stars like Shankar, Mammootty and Mohanlal by the 1980s. He was a mainstream superstar in Malayalam cinema for over 30 years from the late 1950s to late 1980s. He also has an unofficial recognition of playing a campus character while in his late fifties. Prem Nazir has the distinction of acting with the same heroine; Sheela, in over 100 films.

Nazir is generally considered the ultimate romantic hero in Malayalam cinema due to his handsomeness and ease of acting in romantic roles particularly in romantic song sequences. His song sequences combined with the lyrics of Vayalar, tunes of Devarajan and voice of K.J. Yesudas produced what is called the golden era of Malayalam film songs. Prem Nazir has also appeared in the highest number of dual roles (more than 40) in Indian films and perhaps in world cinema.

<text>Rinspeed Inc. is a Swiss concept car manufacturer founded in 1979. Rinspeed often show their designs at CES in Las Vegas and the Geneva Motor Show.

==History==
Rinspeed Inc. was founded in 1979 by Frank M. Rinderknecht and by the 1980s, Rinspeed had become the exclusive Swiss importer of AMG and AC Schnitzer vehicles. Rinspeed became synonymous with launches at the Geneva Motorshow, their first unveiling was, a turbocharged, modified Volkswagen Golf GTI with squared grille and headlamps. In 1981, Rinspeed returned to the show with a more heavily modified Golf called the Aliporta, featuring gullwing doors similar to those on the Delorean DMC-12. In the following years, Rinspeed showed concept Porsche&#x27;s at the Geneva Motorshow including a heavily modified 930 Turbo known as the Rinspeed R39, at the time becoming a unique convertible 911 Turbo that was not in mainstream production and a R69 Turbo concept, a 911 Turbo coupe inspired by the Ferrari Testarossa. It is estimated 12 of the R69s were produced.

In the early 1990s, Rinspeed collaborated with Swiss artist Rolf Knie who hand painted a horse inspired design onto a Nissan 300ZX. Alongside the unique art, the Nissan was heavily modified with parts from suppliers including HKS. Moving through the 1990s and 2000s, Rinspeed continued to demonstrate heavily modified and unique concept cars including futuristic aluminimum bodied sports cars such as the R Roadster, the single seat kompogas powered Advantige R1, a Bugatti EB110 called the Cyan, and a two door, low roof Porsche Cayenne.

In 2006, Rinspeed achieved the world record time for a hydrofoil crossing the English Channel utilising their Splash concept vehicle, taking 3h 14 minutes to cover 36km. Rinspeed continued with their amphibious car concepts in 2008 with the Squba, the world&#x27;s first car that can be driven both on land and underwater. Rinspeed were inspired by the 1977 James Bond film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. The chassis from the Lotus Elise is used as the base for the sQuba.

Moving into the 2020s, Rinspeed have begun to specialise in micro and city mobility on projects such as the microSNAP.

It is also equipped with telescoping laser scanner on the roof called TrackView which can be raised by 70 centimeters and delivers a precise 3D perspective by combining data from all the various sensors to map the surrounding terrain.

=== Ʃtos===

Concept Ʃtos is a concept presented in the Consumer Electronics Show in 2016. It is based on the BMW i8.

===Oasis===
Announced late in 2016 and first shown at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 2017, the Rinspeed Oasis concept car takes Rinspeed&#x27;s 2015 Budii and 2016 Etos concept cars farther, integrating state-of-the art autonomous vehicle technologies, social media, and Mobility as a Service into a compact car described as a &quot;living room&quot; on wheels. It also features floor to ceiling glass doors, a battery-electric engine, retractable steering wheel, solar panels integrated into the roof, and an augmented reality display. An unusual feature, for a car, is the dash-mounted garden with sensors to advise the user when to feed the plants. It was also shown at the Detroit Motor Show.

<text>The Antonov An-22 &quot;Antei&quot; (; ; NATO reporting name: &quot;Cock&quot;) is a heavy military transport aircraft designed by the Antonov Design Bureau in the Soviet Union. Powered by four turboprop engines, each driving a pair of contra-rotating propellers, the design was the first wide-body transport aircraft and remains the world&#x27;s largest turboprop-powered aircraft to date. The An-22 first appeared publicly outside the Soviet Union at the 1965 Paris Air Show. Thereafter, the model saw extensive use in major military and humanitarian airlifts for the Soviet Union, and is still in service with the Russian Aerospace Forces.

== Design and development ==

In the late 1950s, the Soviet Union required a large military transport aircraft to supplement the Antonov An-8 and An-12s then entering service. Originally known as the An-20, the model is a conventional multi-engined high-wing design. In the early 1960s, the Antonov bureau produced a wooden mock up at its Kyiv, Ukraine, workshops of what was designated the Model 100. The prototype, now designated the An-22, was rolled out on 18 August 1964 and first flew on 27 February 1965. The prototype was given the name Antaeus (sometimes misspelled Antheus) and, after four months of test-flying, was displayed at the 1965 Paris Air Show. All aircraft were built at the Tashkent State Aircraft Factory and the first military delivery was made to the Air Transport Wing at Ivanovo Airbase in 1969.

The aircraft was designed as a strategic airlifter, designed specifically to expand the Soviet Airborne Forces&#x27; capability to land with their then-new BMD-1 armoured vehicles. The An-22 cargo hold can accommodate four BMD-1s compared to only one in the An-12.

It has the capability to takeoff from austere, unpaved, and short airstrips, allowing airborne troops to perform air-landing operations. This is achieved by four pairs of contra-rotating propellers, similar to those on the Tupolev Tu-114. The propellers and exhaust from the engines produce a slipstream over the wings and large double-slotted flaps. The landing gear is ruggedized for rough airstrips. In early versions tire pressures could be adjusted in flight for optimum landing performance. That feature was removed in later models.

The An-22 follows traditional cargo transport design with a high-mounted wing allowing a large cargo space of 33 m in length and a usable volume of 639 m³. The forward fuselage is fully pressurized and provides space for 5 to 8 crew and up to 28 passengers, but the cargo space is pressurized to only 3.55 PSI / 0.245 bar allowing for a lighter airframe. A door equipped with pressure bulkhead is located at frame 14, separating the cargo attendant&#x27;s compartment from the main cargo compartment. This allows the rear cargo doors to be opened during flight for paratroops and equipment drop. Like the An-12, the aircraft has a circular fuselage section. The An-22 has set a number of payload and payload-to-height world records.

The An-22 has the general appearance of an enlarged version of the earlier Antonov An-12 except that it is fitted with a twin tail. This gives the An-22 better engine-out performance, and reduces height restrictions for hangars. Also of note are large anti-flutter masses on the top of each tail.
Only one production variant was built, the standard An-22. Prototypes, such as the one first featured at the 1965 Paris Air Show had fully glazed noses that lacked the nose-mounted radar of production models. Those aircraft had the radar mounted below the right wheel well fairing, forward of the wheels. Antonov designated a variant with a modified electrical system and an additional augmented flight control system the An-22A but the designation was not used by the military.

A civil airliner version with a lengthened fuselage capable of seating 724 passengers on upper and lower decks was studied but was not built.

== Variants ==

;An-22
:Three original prototypes were built at the Antonov facility in Kyiv, with glass nose.
;Amphibious An-22
:An amphibian version of the An-22 was proposed, but did not progress past the scale model phase.
;An-22
:Initial production variant with external start system, 37 built at Tashkent.
;An-22A
:Improved variant with air-start capability, modified electrical system, and updated radio and navigation equipment, 28 built at Tashkent.
;An-22PZ
:Conversion of two An-22s to carry wing centre sections or outer wings of Antonov An-124 or An-225 externally above fuselage. Fitted with third centreline fin.

Several other An-22 variants were projected and constructed by Antonov but never entered serial production, notably a nuclear-powered aircraft and a ballistic missile platform.

== Operational history ==
The An-22 was originally built for the Soviet Air Force and Aeroflot (the state airline). Conversion from An-12 in the Air Force began in July 1974. Several Military Transport Aviation units were equipped. The 12th Mginsk Red Banner Military Transport Aviation Division (based at Migalovo) was one of the units which had its three regiments entirely equipped with the An-22s. Another unit that operated it was the 566th Solnechnogorsk Military Transport Aviation Regiment, which used the An-22 from 1970 to 1987.

An early use of the An-22 was to deliver Soviet humanitarian aid to Peru in July 1970 following the Ancash earthquake. One An-22 disappeared on 18 July during these relief flights. An-22s were also used to deliver Soviet military aid to Egypt and Syria during the Yom Kippur War in 1973, to Angola in 1975, and to Ethiopia in 1977.

The An-22s from Migalovo were used for the initial deployment of the Soviet Airborne Troops (VDV) during the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. One An-22 was shot down at takeoff (probably by an SA-7 missile) near Kabul on 28 October 1984 with about 250 casualties as the aircraft was used as troop carrier. In 1980, one An-22 crashed at Vnukovo Airport while two crashed at Migalovo (in 1992 and 1994).

In 1984, military An-22s were used to deliver Mi-8 helicopters to Ethiopia during drought relief operations.

In 1986 the aircraft of the 8th Military Air Transport Aviation Regiment from Migalovo were used to deliver materials for the Chernobyl disaster relief operation.

During 1987 the An-22s were used to deliver military equipment to Angola. A year later the military An-22s were used to deliver 15,000 tons and 1,000 personnel for the 1988 Armenian earthquake relief operation.
The An-22 aircraft were often seen at the Le Bourget Air Show, and in 1988 delivered an engine from the An-124 to the Farnborough Airshow.

In late 1980s, the An-22s were used to deliver Internal Troops to many regional conflicts during and after the breakup of the Soviet Union. In 1995 they deployed the Russian peacekeeping force from the 98th Guards Airborne Division during the Bosnian War.

Approximately 45 An-22s remained in service by the mid-1990s, mostly with the Russian Air Force, but these are slowly being replaced by the bigger turbofan-powered Antonov An-124. The remaining An-22s appear to be operated by an independent military transport aviation squadron at Migalovo base in Tver.

As of December 2018, six An-22s were in service with the 76th Military Transport Air Squadron at Tver, with only three aircraft airworthy. They are planned to remain in service until 2033.

A single An-22 (registration number UR-09307) is in service with Antonov Airlines as of September 26, 2020 but was potentially damaged in 2022 during Russia&#x27;s military action in Ukraine.
