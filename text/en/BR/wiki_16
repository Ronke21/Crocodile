<text>The Millennium Line is the second line of the SkyTrain rapid transit system in the Metro Vancouver region of British Columbia, Canada. The line is owned and operated by BC Rapid Transit Company, a subsidiary of TransLink, and links the cities of Vancouver, Burnaby, Coquitlam and Port Moody. The line was opened in 2002 and was named in recognition of the new millennium.

==Route==
The Millennium Line operates from VCC–Clark station in Vancouver to Lafarge Lake–Douglas station in Coquitlam. The line is elevated to Burquitlam station, where it then goes through a bored tunnel to the city of Port Moody. In Port Moody, the line runs at grade level, rising to cross railway tracks. From Coquitlam Central station, the line is elevated to the terminus at Lafarge Lake–Douglas station.

When the Evergreen Extension opened in late 2016, eastbound trains crossed the westbound tracks to access the new northernmost platform (Platform 3) at Lougheed Town Centre station. Trains then operated left-track running to a crossover junction just before Burquitlam Station, where trains crossed back to right-track running. Westbound Millennium Line trains crossed over to left-hand running just south of Burquitlam station, which allowed them to access westbound Platform 2 at Lougheed Town Centre station. This unusual service design allowed same-platform interchange for Expo Line passengers arriving at Lougheed Town Centre and continuing west towards VCC–Clark station on the Millennium Line.

On June 25, 2018, service patterns were changed to eliminate all left-track running. This change meant passengers arriving westbound at Lougheed on the Expo Line who wished to continue towards VCC–Clark could either change platforms at Lougheed or remain on their Expo Line train until its terminus at the next station, Production Way–University, where they could make a same-platform transfer to a westbound Millennium Line train. For passengers arriving eastbound at Lougheed, transfers between eastbound Millennium and Expo Line trains were now same-platform. TransLink stated the change to traditional right-track running would provide faster and more reliable trips for passengers as the many track changes the initial service pattern required had resulted in delays.

==History==
===Early proposals===
When the Expo Line was opened in 1985, an extension to Lougheed Mall in east Burnaby was proposed. The most likely junction point for the spur to Lougheed Mall would have been from Royal Oak station, up Edmonds Street to Lougheed Mall, although early SkyTrain route maps also suggested an extension northeast from New Westminster. Neither plan was realized, although the extension of Expo Line tracks to Columbia Station in 1989 and the completion of the SkyBridge to Surrey in 1990 resulted in a short spur east of Columbia station, which was later incorporated into the new Millennium Line.

===Phase I: Columbia to Commercial Drive (2002)===

In 1995, the British Columbia government announced that an entirely new line, a street-level light rail line, would be built along Broadway and Lougheed Highway to Lougheed Mall (served by Lougheed Town Centre station), as the first phase of the &quot;T&quot;-Line (one of three Intermediate Capacity Transit System lines) outlined in the Metro Vancouver&#x27;s Livable Region Strategic Plan that extended into Coquitlam. An 18-month review of rapid transit was scheduled and started in January 1998 but was cut short by the government&#x27;s announcement of its choice of Bombardier&#x27;s technology in June 1998. This meant that the first phase of the line would have to connect to the existing Expo Line to use its maintenance yard. Connecting the two lines at Broadway station was deemed impracticable, so the lines were connected in New Westminster. Switches to the Millennium Line were installed on the Expo Line just east of Columbia station. Expo Line service was reduced to a single track over the Skybridge during the installation of these switches. The main contractor for the project was SAR Transit, a joint venture of SC Infrastructure, Agra Monenco, and Rizzani de Eccher Inc.

The Millennium Line opened for revenue service on January 7, 2002 (a preview for SkyTrain passengers took place on the prior two days), with trains operating between Waterfront station on the Expo Line and Braid station in eastern New Westminster.

For the second phase, service was extended to Commercial Drive station (since merged with Broadway station to form Commercial–Broadway) on August 31, 2002 (with full integration with the bus network occurring on September 3, 2002).

===Lake City Way and extension to VCC–Clark (2003–2006)===
Lake City Way station, located between Sperling–Burnaby Lake and Production Way–University stations, opened on November 21, 2003. Three years later, the line was extended to its present terminus, VCC–Clark station, on January 6, 2006. The Millennium Line was now completed at a cost of $1.2billion, $40million under budget.

In 2007, the non-interlined portion of the Millennium Line served an average of 70,000 passengers per day. Of these, 14,000 passengers arrived on trains travelling from Expo Line stations west of Columbia station, and 7,000 transferred from the Surrey section of the Expo Line. In 2009, it was estimated that ridership had grown to at least 80,000 passengers per day.

Initially, the Millennium Line service followed the Expo Line from Waterfront to Columbia stations, then looped back into Vancouver via the new route, passing through Commercial–Broadway again at a different platform, and terminating at VCC–Clark station. After a reconfiguration on October 22, 2016, in preparation for the opening of the Evergreen Extension, the Millennium Line ran between VCC–Clark station in the west to Lougheed Town Centre station in the east. Transfers to the Expo Line were now made possible at Production Way–University and Lougheed Town Centre stations. Braid and Sapperton stations were reassigned to the Expo Line.

===Phase II: Evergreen Extension (2016)===

The second phase of the Millennium Line was to be an extension from Lougheed Mall to Coquitlam (then known as the Port Moody–Coquitlam (PMC) Line), which would have provided a &quot;one-seat ride&quot; from Coquitlam to VCC–Clark station. A short spur and switches to the PMC Line were installed to the east of Lougheed Town Centre station and a third platform was roughed-in in anticipation of the extension. Phase II was placed on hold following a change in provincial government.

A SkyTrain extension from Lougheed Town Centre station to Coquitlam Town Centre was proposed when the original Millennium Line was built and the necessary junction tracks for such an extension were built at the station during its initial construction. At one point prior to 2008, the mode planned for the extension was changed to light rail instead of SkyTrain, which meant that the junction tracks would have remained unused. However, in February 2008, plans reverted to the use of SkyTrain technology for the extension, to facilitate higher ridership, shorten travel times and to integrate seamlessly with the existing SkyTrain network. As a result, the junction tracks and roughed-in third platform at Lougheed Town Centre station were used as part of the Evergreen Extension.

Construction of the Evergreen Extension began in 2013 and was completed in late 2016. The extension opened for revenue service on December 2, 2016.

==Expansion plans==
===Broadway extension===
On March 16, 2018, the provincial government approved the construction of the &quot;Broadway Subway Project&quot;, an initiative which will extend the Millennium Line west to Arbutus Street and add six new stations. The extension will be long, all but of which will be underground, and cost an estimated $2.83billion. Originally scheduled for a 2025 opening, the expected opening was pushed back to early 2026 in November 2022. The delay was caused by a labour dispute involving concrete workers which started in June 2022. On May 24, 2024, the province revealed that the project would be delayed further, to late 2027.

While six new stations are confirmed for the Broadway extension, one will become part of the existing Broadway–City Hall Canada Line station, which is scheduled to be upgraded as part of the project:
* Great Northern Way–Emily Carr station, at Great Northern Way and Thornton Street adjacent to the Emily Carr University
* Mount Pleasant station, at Main Street and East Broadway
* Broadway–City Hall station, at Cambie Street and West Broadway. The existing Broadway–City Hall station on the Canada Line, originally designed with a &quot;knock-out&quot; panel to accommodate a connection to a future Millennium Line extension, will be upgraded and connected to the extension. An adjacent development was required by the City of Vancouver to provide space for an additional entrance to the Millennium Line portion of the station.
* Oak–VGH station, at Laurel Street and West Broadway near Vancouver General Hospital (VGH)
* South Granville station, at Granville Street and West Broadway
* Arbutus station, at Arbutus Street and West Broadway. The 99 B-Line bus route, which follows much of the extension&#x27;s route, will be truncated to terminate at this station.

==== Construction ====
Preliminary work on the extension began on February 19, 2019, with the installation of trolley poles and wires on 12th Avenue between Arbutus and Granville Streets that were required in order to reroute trolley buses off of Broadway for the duration of the construction of the subway. On June 22, 2020, trolleybuses were removed from Broadway. The provincial government initially had a plan to have a contractor selected by April 2020 to allow for construction to begin later that year. On July 17, 2020, the provincial Ministry of Transportation announced that Acciona Infrastructure, a Spanish conglomerate, and Ghella, an Italian company, would be in charge of construction. Demolition of buildings, to make room for station entrances and construction staging areas, began in February 2021.

Major construction on the extension began on May 13, 2021. &quot;Traffic decks&quot; began to be installed over Mount Pleasant, Broadway–City Hall, Oak–VGH, South Granville, and Arbutus stations, to avoid closing Broadway while station construction takes place underneath. Construction of the elevated guideway at the eastern end of the extension began on December 13, 2021. This guideway is the only above-ground portion of the extension and connects the existing VCC–Clark station to a tunnel portal adjacent to the Emily Carr University of Art and Design. 

The tunnel boring machines for the project were delivered to Vancouver between April and June 2022. Two identical machines, each in diameter and in length, would dig about of tunnel per day, at a depth of below the surface. The two machines were named Elsie and Phyllis, honouring two influential Vancouver residents: aeronautical engineer Elsie MacGill and mountaineer Phyllis Munday. Elsie began tunnelling the eastbound tunnel from Great Northern Way–Emily Carr station in October 2022, with Phyllis beginning work on the westbound tunnel in late November. Both machines had reached Broadway–City Hall station by May 26, 2023, and South Granville station by February 8, 2024. Phyllis completed boring at Arbutus station on March 20, 2024, and the tunnel boring phase was fully completed when Elsie reached Arbutus on April 26, 2024.

===University of British Columbia extension===
On January 14, 2008, the Government of British Columbia announced a commitment to the expansion of the Millennium Line to the University of British Columbia (UBC) by 2020 as part of a $14-billion transit spending package to address global warming. It was not clear what route the new line would take, but it was hinted that there would be less use of cut-and-cover tunnelling to minimize disruption to businesses along Broadway and avoid the same problems seen during the Canada Line construction along Cambie Street. This expansion failed to materialize. 

On February 15, 2019, the TransLink Mayors&#x27; Council again approved an extension of the line to the UBC campus, although funding for this continuation past Arbutus Street had not yet been secured. In 2022, TransLink unveiled a proposed route for the extension: the line would continue west under Broadway, with stations at Macdonald and Alma Streets. It would then deviate slightly north to a station serving the redevelopment at the Jericho Lands. In the University Endowment Lands, the line would either take an elevated route following University Boulevard, or a tunnelled route underneath the University Golf Club, to get to UBC at a station under the University Boulevard bus loop. The station locations at Macdonald Street, Alma Street, and the Jericho Lands were approved by the Vancouver City Council in March 2022.

===Port Coquitlam extension===
When the Evergreen Extension was built, the first few metres of track and a track switch to allow for an eventual eastward extension to Port Coquitlam were built at Coquitlam Central station. This would create two branches where trains would alternate between going east to Lafarge Lake–Douglas station or to Port Coquitlam. A feasibility study was conducted, started during early 2020 and running for about six months. Port Coquitlam mayor Brad West, the Port Coquitlam city council, and the Coquitlam City Council all voiced support for the extension. However, as of 2022, no funding had been secured nor a formal plan created.

<text>The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), also known as Indian Affairs (IA), is a United States federal agency within the Department of the Interior. It is responsible for implementing federal laws and policies related to Native Americans and Alaska Natives, and administering and managing over of reservations held in trust by the U.S. federal government for indigenous tribes. It renders services to roughly 2 million indigenous Americans across 574 federally recognized tribes. The BIA is governed by a director and overseen by the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, who answers to the Secretary of the Interior.

The BIA works with tribal governments to help administer law enforcement and justice; promote development in agriculture, infrastructure, and the economy; enhance tribal governance; manage natural resources; and generally advance the quality of life in tribal communities. Educational services are provided by Bureau of Indian Education—the only other agency under the Assistant Secretary for Indian affairs—while health care is the responsibility of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services through its Indian Health Service.

The BIA is one of the oldest federal agencies in the U.S., with roots tracing back to the Committee on Indian Affairs established by Congress in 1775. First headed by Benjamin Franklin, the committee oversaw trade and treaty relations with various indigenous peoples, until the establishment of the Bureau of Indian Affairs by Secretary of War John C. Calhoun in 1824. The BIA gained statutory authority in 1832, and in 1849 was transferred to the newly created Department of the Interior. Until the formal adoption of its current name in 1947, the BIA was variably known as the Indian office, the Indian bureau, the Indian department, and the Indian Service.

The BIA&#x27;s mission and mandate historically reflected the U.S. government&#x27;s prevailing policy of forced assimilation of native peoples and the annexation of their land; beginning with the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, the BIA has increasingly emphasized tribal self-determination and peer-to-peer relationships between tribal governments and federal government.

Between 1824 and 1977, the BIA was led by a total of 42 commissioners, of whom six were of indigenous descent. Since the creation of the position of Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs in 1977, all thirteen occupants up to the present day have been Indigenous, including Bay Mills Indian Community&#x27;s Bryan Newland, appointed and confirmed to the position in 2021. the majority of BIA employees are American Indian or Alaska Native, the most at any time in the agency&#x27;s history.

==Organization==

Headquartered in the Main Interior Building in Washington, D.C., the BIA is headed by a bureau director who reports to the assistant secretary for Indian affairs. The current assistant secretary is Bryan Newland.

The BIA oversees 574 federally recognized tribes through four offices:

* Office of Indian Services: operates the BIA&#x27;s general assistance, disaster relief, Indian child welfare, tribal government, Indian self-determination, and Indian Reservation Roads Program.
* Office of Justice Services (OJS): directly operates or funds law enforcement, tribal courts, and detention facilities on federal Indian lands. OJS funded 208 law enforcement agencies, consisting of 43 BIA-operated police agencies, and 165 tribally operated agencies under contract, or compact with the OJS. The office has seven areas of activity: Criminal Investigations and Police Services, Detention/Corrections, Inspection/Internal Affairs, Tribal Law Enforcement and Special Initiatives, the Indian Police Academy, Tribal Justice Support, and Program Management. The OJS also provides oversight and technical assistance to tribal law enforcement programs when and where requested. It operates four divisions: Corrections, Drug Enforcement, the Indian Police Academy, and Law Enforcement.
* Office of Trust Services: works with tribes and individual American Indians and Alaska Natives in the management of their trust lands, assets, and resources.
* The Office of Field Operations: oversees 12 regional offices; Alaska, Great Plains, Northwest, Southern Plains, Eastern, Navajo, Pacific, Southwest, Eastern Oklahoma, Midwest, Rocky Mountain, and Western; and 83 agencies, which carry out the mission of the bureau at the tribal level.

==History==

=== Early US agencies and legislation: Intercourse Acts ===

Agencies related to Native Americans originated in 1775, when the Second Continental Congress created a trio of Indian-related agencies. Benjamin Franklin and Patrick Henry were appointed among the early commissioners to negotiate treaties with Native Americans to obtain their neutrality during the American Revolutionary War.

=== Office of Indian Trade (1806–1822) ===
In 1789, the U.S. Congress placed Native American relations within the newly formed War Department. By 1806 the Congress had created a Superintendent of Indian Trade, or &quot;Office of Indian Trade&quot; within the War Department, who was charged with maintaining the United States Government Fur Trade Factory System. The post was held by Thomas L. McKenney from 1816 until the abolition of the factory system in 1822.

The government licensed traders to have some control in Indian territories and gain a share of the lucrative trade.

=== Bureau of Indian Affairs (1824–present) ===
The abolition of the factory system left a vacuum within the U.S. government regarding Native American relations. The Bureau of Indian Affairs was formed on March 11, 1824, by Secretary of War John C. Calhoun, who created the agency as a division within his department, without authorization from the United States Congress. He appointed McKenney as the first head of the office, which went by several names. McKenney preferred to call it the &quot;Indian Office&quot;, whereas the current name was preferred by Calhoun.

The Bureau was initially organized by region, with commissions for Superintendents of Indian Affairs granted to prominent citizens in each region of the southern, midwestern and western United States. These superindenents were authorized to negotiate with tribes and oversaw Indian agents in their assigned region. The bureau was eventually reorganized in 1878, with superintendencies removed. These were eventually replaced with regional offices, which continue today.

=== The Removal Era (1830–1850) ===
The BIA&#x27;s goal to protect domestic and dependent nations, was reaffirmed by the 1831 court case Cherokee Nation v. Georgia. The Supreme Court originally refused to hear the case, because the Cherokee nation was not an independent state and could not litigate in the federal court. It was not until the court case Worcester v. Georgia, when Chief Justice John Marshall allowed Native American tribes to be recognized as &quot;domestic dependent nations.&quot; These court cases set precedent for future treaties, as more Native tribes were recognized as domestic and dependent nations.

This period was encompassed by westward expansion and the removal of Native Nations. In 1833 Georgians fought for the removal of the Cherokee Nation from the state of Georgia. Despite the rulings of Worcester v. Georgia, President Jackson and John C. Calhoun created a plan for removal. The removal of the Cherokee Nation occurred in 1838 and was accompanied by the Treaty of 1846. When reparations from the treaty were unfulfilled, the Senate Committee on the Indian Affairs made the final settlement in 1850. This settlement, &quot;supported the position of the Cherokee that the cost of maintaining the tribesman during their removal and the years upkeep after their arrival West should be paid by the federal government, and the expense of the removal agents should be paid as well.&quot;

In 1832 Congress established the position of Commissioner of Indian Affairs. In 1849 Indian Affairs was transferred to the newly established U.S. Department of the Interior. In 1869, Ely Samuel Parker was the first Native American to be appointed as commissioner of Indian affairs.

=== Assimilation (1890–1930) ===
One of the most controversial policies of the Bureau of Indian Affairs was the late 19th to early 20th century decision to educate native children in separate boarding schools, such as the Carlisle Indian Industrial School. The goal was to train students in the proper behavior according to prevailing standards of &quot;civilization.&quot; That way they could assimilate into American society and not be permanently trapped in reservations. The boarding schools prohibited students from using their indigenous languages, practices, and cultures.

Another force for assimilation and Euro-American control was the Bureau of Indian Affairs tribal police force. This was designed by its agents to decrease the power of American Indian leaders.

=== Reform and reorganization (mid to late 20th century) ===

The bureau was renamed from Office of Indian Affairs to Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1947.

With the rise of American Indian activism in the 1960s and 1970s and increasing demands for enforcement of treaty rights and sovereignty, the 1970s were a particularly turbulent period of BIA history. The rise of activist groups such as the American Indian Movement (AIM) worried the U.S. government; the FBI responded both overtly and covertly (by creating COINTELPRO and other programs) to suppress possible uprisings among native peoples.

As a branch of the U.S. government with personnel on Indian reservations, BIA police were involved in political actions such as:

The occupation of BIA headquarters in Washington, D.C., in 1972: On November 3, 1972, a group of around 500 American Indians with the AIM took over the BIA building, the culmination of their Trail of Broken Treaties walk. They intended to bring attention to American Indian issues, including their demands for renewed negotiation of treaties, enforcement of treaty rights and improvement in living standards. They occupied the Department of Interior headquarters from November 3 to 9, 1972. 
:Feeling the government was ignoring them, the protesters vandalized the building. After a week, the protesters left, having caused $700,000 in damages. Many records were lost, destroyed or stolen, including irreplaceable treaties, deeds, and water rights records, which some Indian officials said could set the tribes back 50 to 100 years.
* The Wounded Knee Incident of 1973, where activists at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation occupied land for more than two months.
* The 1975 Pine Ridge shootout (for which Leonard Peltier was convicted of killing two FBI agents).

The BIA was implicated in supporting controversial tribal presidents, notably Dick Wilson, who was charged with being authoritarian; using tribal funds for a private paramilitary force, the Guardians of the Oglala Nation (or &quot;GOON squad&quot;), which he employed against opponents; intimidation of voters in the 1974 election; misappropriation of funds, and other misdeeds. Many native peoples continue to oppose policies of the BIA. In particular, problems in enforcing treaties, handling records and trust land incomes were disputed.

=== 21st century ===
In 2002 Congress worked with the Bureau to prepare bill S.1392, which established procedures for tribal recognition. A separate bill S. 1393 ensured full and fair participation in decision-making processes at the Bureau via grants. Both bills addressed what services, limitations, obligations, and responsibilities a federally recognized tribe possessed. The bills excluded any splinter groups, political factions, and any groups formed after December 31, 2002.

In 2013 the Bureau was greatly affected by sequestration funding cuts of $800 million, which particularly affected the already-underfunded Indian Health Service.

==Legal issues==

===Employee overtime===
The Bureau of Indian Affairs has been sued four times in class action overtime lawsuits brought by the Federation of Indian Service Employees, a union which represents the federal civilian employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Bureau of Indian Education, the assistant secretary of Indian affairs and the Office of the Special Trustee for Indian Affairs. The grievances allege widespread violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and claim tens of millions of dollars in damages.

===Trust assets===
&quot;Cobell vs. Salazar,&quot; a major class action case related to trust lands, was settled in December 2009. The suit was filed against the U.S. Department of Interior, of which the BIA is a part. A major responsibility has been the management of the Indian trust accounts. This was a class-action lawsuit regarding the federal government&#x27;s management and accounting of more than 300,000 individual American Indian and Alaska Native trust accounts. A settlement fund totaling $3.4 billion is to be distributed to class members. This is to compensate for claims that prior U.S. officials had mismanaged the administration of Indian trust assets. In addition, the settlement establishes a $2 billion fund enabling federally recognized tribes to voluntarily buy back and consolidate fractionated land interests.

==Mission==
The bureau is currently trying to evolve from a supervisory to an advisory role. However, this has been a difficult task as the BIA is known by many Indians as playing a police role in which the U.S. government historically dictated to tribes and their members what they could and could not do in accordance with treaties signed by both.

<text>Polycythemia (also known as polycythaemia) is a laboratory finding in which the hematocrit (the volume percentage of red blood cells in the blood) and/or hemoglobin concentration are increased in the blood. Polycythemia is sometimes called erythrocytosis, and there is significant overlap in the two findings, but the terms are not the same: polycythemia describes any increase in hematocrit and/or hemoglobin, while erythrocytosis describes an increase specifically in the number of red blood cells in the blood.

Polycythemia has many causes. It can describe an increase in the number of red blood cells (&quot;absolute polycythemia&quot;) or to a decrease in the volume of plasma (&quot;relative polycythemia&quot;). Absolute polycythemia can be due to genetic mutations in the bone marrow (&quot;primary polycythemia&quot;), physiologic adaptations to one&#x27;s environment, medications, and/or other health conditions. Laboratory studies such as serum erythropoeitin levels and genetic testing might be helpful to clarify the cause of polycythemia if the physical exam and patient history do not reveal a likely cause.

Mild polycythemia on its own is often asymptomatic. Treatment for polycythemia varies, and typically involves treating its underlying cause. Treatment of primary polycythemia (see polycythemia vera) could involve phlebotomy, antiplatelet therapy to reduce risk of blood clots, and additional cytoreductive therapy to reduce the number of red blood cells produced in the bone marrow.

== Definition ==
Polycythemia is defined as serum hematocrit (Hct) or hemoglobin (HgB) exceeding normal ranges expected for age and sex, typically Hct &gt;49% in healthy adult men and &gt;48% in women, or HgB &gt;16.5 g/dL in men or &gt;16.0 g/dL in women. The definition is different for neonates and varies by age in children.

== Differential diagnoses ==

=== Polycythemia in adults ===
Different diseases or conditions can cause polycythemia in adults. These processes are discussed in more detail in their respective sections below.

Relative polycythemia, also known as pseudopolycythemia, is not a true increase in the number of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, but rather an elevated laboratory finding caused by reduced blood plasma (hypovolemia, cf. dehydration). Relative polycythemia is often caused by loss of body fluids, such as through burns, dehydration, and stress. A specific type of relative polycythemia is Gaisböck syndrome. In this syndrome, primarily occurring in obese men, hypertension causes a reduction in plasma volume, resulting in (amongst other changes) a relative increase in red blood cell count. If relative polycythemia is deemed unlikely because the patient has no other signs of hemoconcentration, and has sustained polycythemia without clear loss of body fluids, the patient likely has absolute or true polycythemia.

Absolute polycythemia can be split into two categories:
* Primary polycythemia is the overproduction of red blood cells due to a primary process in the bone marrow (a so-called myeloproliferative disease). These can be familial or congenital, or acquired later in life.
* Alternatively, additional red blood cells may have been received through another process—for example, being over-transfused (either accidentally or, as blood doping, deliberately).

=== Polycythemia in neonates ===
Polycythemia in newborns is defined as hematocrit &gt; 65%. Significant polycythemia can be associated with blood hyperviscosity, or thickening of the blood. Causes of neonatal polycythemia include: 

* Hypoxia: Poor oxygen delivery (hypoxia) in utero resulting in compensatory increased production of red blood cells (erythropoeisis). Hypoxia can be either acute or chronic. Acute hypoxia can occur as a result of perinatal complications. Chronic fetal hypoxia is associated with maternal risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and smoking.
* Umbilical cord stripping: delayed cord clamping and the stripping of the umbilical cord towards the baby can cause the residual blood in the cord/placenta to enter fetal circulation, which can increase blood volume.
* The recipient twin in a pregnancy undergoing twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome can have polycythemia.

== Pathophysiology ==
The pathophysiology of polycythemia varies based on its cause. The production of red blood cells (or erythropoeisis) in the body is regulated by erythropoietin, which is a protein produced by the kidneys in response to poor oxygen delivery. As a result, more erythropoeitin is produced to encourage red blood cell production and increase oxygen-carrying capacity. This results in secondary polycythemia, which can be an appropriate response to hypoxic conditions such as chronic smoking, obstructive sleep apnea, and high altitude. Furthermore, certain genetic conditions can impair the body&#x27;s accurate detection of oxygen levels in the serum, which leads to excess erythropoeitin production even without hypoxia or impaired oxygen delivery to tissues. Alternatively, certain types of cancers, most notably renal cell carcinoma, and medications such as testosterone use can cause inappropriate erythropoeitin production that stimulates red cell production despite adequate oxygen delivery. 

Primary polycythemia, on the other hand, is caused by genetic mutations or defects of the red cell progenitors within the bone marrow, leading to overgrowth and hyperproliferation of red blood cells regardless of erythropoeitin levels. 

Increased hematocrit and red cell mass with polycythemia increases the viscosity of blood, leading to impaired blood flow and contributing to an increased risk of clotting (thrombosis). 

== Evaluation ==

=== History and physical exam ===
The first step to evaluate new polycythemia in any individual is to conduct a detailed history and physical exam. Patients should be asked about smoking history, altitude, medication use, personal bleeding and clotting history, symptoms of sleep apnea (snoring, apneic episodes), and any family history of hematologic conditions or polycythemia. A thorough cardiopulmonary exam including auscultation of the heart and lungs can help evaluate for cardiac shunting or chronic pulmonary disease. An abdominal exam can assess for splenomegaly, which can be seen in polycythemia vera. Examination of digits for erythromelalgia, clubbing or cyanosis can help assess for chronic hypoxia.

=== Laboratory evaluation ===
Polycythemia is often initially identified on a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC is often repeated to evaluate for persistent polycythemia. If an etiology of polycythemia is unclear from history or physical, additional laboratory evaluation might include:

* Blood smear to evaluate cell morphology
* Iron panel to evaluate for concurrent iron deficiency 
* JAK2 mutation testing
* Serum erythropoeitin (EPO) levels
* Oxygen saturation (usually via pulse oximetry or blood gas tests) or oxygen dissociation tests

=== Additional testing ===

* Sleep studies if high suspicion for sleep apnea
* Abdominal imaging, such as ultrasound
* Erythropoietin receptor or von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) genetic testing, if high suspicion for familial erythrocytosis
* Hemoglobin (globin-gene) sequencing or high-performance liquid chromatography to evaluate for high-affinity hemoglobin variants
* Bone marrow biopsy might be considered in specific cases

==Absolute polycythemia==
===Primary polycythemia===

Primary polycythemias are myeloproliferative diseases affecting red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow. Polycythemia vera (PCV) (a.k.a. polycythemia rubra vera (PRV)) occurs when excess red blood cells are produced as a result of an abnormality of the bone marrow. Often, excess white blood cells and platelets are also produced. A hallmark of polycythemia vera is an elevated hematocrit, with Hct &gt; 55% seen in 83% of cases. A somatic (non-hereditary) mutation (V617F) in the &quot;JAK2&quot; gene, also present in other myeloproliferative disorders, is found in 95% of cases. Symptoms include headaches and vertigo, and signs on physical examination include an abnormally enlarged spleen and/or liver. Studies suggest that mean arterial pressure (MAP) only increases when hematocrit levels are 20% over baseline. When hematocrit levels are lower than that percentage, the MAP decreases in response, which may be due, in part, to the increase in viscosity and the decrease in plasma layer width. Furthermore, affected individuals may have other associated conditions alongside high blood pressure, including formation of blood clots. Transformation to acute leukemia is rare. Phlebotomy is the mainstay of treatment.

Primary familial polycythemia, also known as primary familial and congenital polycythemia (PFCP), exists as a benign hereditary condition, in contrast with the myeloproliferative changes associated with acquired PCV. In many families, PFCP is due to an autosomal dominant mutation in the &quot;EPOR&quot; erythropoietin receptor gene. PFCP can cause an increase of up to 50% in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood; skier Eero Mäntyranta had PFCP, which is speculated to have given him an advantage in endurance events.

=== Secondary polycythemia ===
Secondary polycythemia is caused by either natural or artificial increases in the production of erythropoietin, hence an increased production of erythrocytes. 

Secondary polycythemia in which the production of erythropoietin increases appropriately is called physiologic polycythemia. Conditions which may result in physiologic polycythemia include:
* Altitude related – Polycythemia can be a normal adaptation to living at high altitudes (see altitude sickness). Many athletes train at high altitude to take advantage of this effect, which can be considered a legal form of blood doping, although the efficacy of this strategy is unclear. 
* Hypoxic disease-associated – for example, in cyanotic heart disease where blood oxygen levels are reduced significantly; in hypoxic lung disease such as COPD; in chronic obstructive sleep apnea; conditions that reduce blood flow to the kidney e.g. renal artery stenosis. Chronic carbon monoxide poisoning (which can be present in heavy smokers) and rarely methemoglobinemia can also impair oxygen delivery.
* Genetic – Heritable causes of secondary polycythemia include abnormalities in hemoglobin oxygen release, which results in a greater inherent affinity for oxygen than normal adult hemoglobin and reduces oxygen delivery to tissues. 
Conditions where the secondary polycythemia is not caused by physiologic adaptation, and occurs irrespective of body needs include:
* Neoplasms – Renal cell carcinoma, liver tumors, Von Hippel–Lindau disease, and endocrine abnormalities including pheochromocytoma and adrenal adenoma with Cushing&#x27;s syndrome.
* Anabolic steroid use – people whose testosterone levels are high, including athletes who abuse steroids, people on testosterone replacement for hypogonadism or transgender hormone replacement therapy.
* Blood doping – Athletes who take erythropoietin-stimulating agents or receive blood transfusions to increase their red blood cell mass.
* Post-transplant erythrocytosis – About 10–15% of patients after renal transplantation are found to have polycythemia at 24 months after transplantation, which can be associated with increased thrombotic (clotting) risk. 

==== Altered oxygen sensing ====
Rare inherited mutations in three genes which all result in increased stability of hypoxia-inducible factors, leading to increased erythropoietin production, have been shown to cause secondary polycythemia:
* Chuvash erythrocytosis or Chuvash polycythemia is an autosomal recessive form of erythrocytosis endemic in patients from the Chuvash Republic in Russia. Chuvash erythrocytosis is associated with homozygosity for a C598T mutation in the von Hippel–Lindau gene (&quot;VHL&quot;), which is needed for the destruction of hypoxia-inducible factors in the presence of oxygen. Clusters of patients with Chuvash erythrocytosis have been found in other populations, such as on the Italian island of Ischia, located in the Bay of Naples. Patients with Chuvash erythrocytosis experience a significantly elevated risk of events.
* PHD2 erythrocytosis: Heterozygosity for loss-of-function mutations of the &quot;PHD2&quot; gene are associated with autosomal dominant erythrocytosis and increased hypoxia-inducible factors activity.
* HIF2α erythrocytosis: Gain-of-function mutations in&quot; HIF2α &quot;are associated with autosomal dominant erythrocytosis and pulmonary hypertension.

== Symptoms ==
Polycythemia is often asymptomatic; patients may not experience any notable symptoms until their red cell count is very high. For patients with significant elevations in hemoglobin or hematocrit (often from polycythemia vera), some non-specific symptoms include:
* A ruddy (red) complexion, or plethora
* Headache, transient blurry vision (amaurosis fugax), other signs of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke
* Dizziness, fatigue
* Unusual bleeding, nosebleeds
* Pain in abdomen from enlarged spleen in polycythemia vera 
* Pain in hands and feet (erythromelalgia)
* Itchiness, especially after a hot shower (aquagenic pruritis)
* Numbness or tingling in different body parts

== Epidemiology ==
The prevalence of primary polycythemia (polycythemia vera) was estimated to be approximately 44–57 per 100,000 individuals in the United States. Secondary polycythemia is considered to be more common, but its exact prevalence is unknown. In one study using the NHANES dataset, the prevalence of unexplained erythrocytosis is 35.1 per 100,000, and was higher among males and among individuals between ages 50–59 and 60–69.

== Management ==
The management of polycythemia varies based on its etiology:

* See polycythemia vera for management of primary polycythemia, which involves reducing thrombotic risk, symptom amelioration and monitoring for further hematologic complications. Treatment can include phlebotomy, aspirin, and myelosuppressive or cytoreductive medications based on risk stratification.
* For secondary polycythemia, management involves addressing the underlying etiology of increased erythropoeitin production, such as smoking cessation, CPAP for sleep apnea, or removing any EPO-producing tumours. Phlebotomy is not typically recommended for patients with physiologic polycythemia, who rely on additional red cell mass for necessary oxygen delivery, unless the patient is clearly symptomatic and experiences relief from phlebotomy. It is unclear if patients with secondary polycythemia are at elevated thrombotic risk, but aspirin can be considered for patients at elevated cardiovascular risk or for patients with Chuvash polycythemia. The first-line treatment for post-transplant erythrocytosis specificity is angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.

=== Relation to athletic performance ===
Polycythemia is theorized to increased performance in endurance sports due to the blood being able to store more oxygen. This idea has led to the illegal use of blood doping and transfusions among professional athletes, as well as use of altitude training or elevation training masks to simulate a low-oxygen environment. However, the benefits of altitude training for athletes to improve sea-level performance are not universally accepted, with one reason being athletes at altitude might exert less power during training.

<text>Rebellion is an uprising that resists and is organized against one&#x27;s government. A rebel is a person who engages in a rebellion. A rebel group is a consciously coordinated group that seeks to gain political control over an entire state or a portion of a state. A rebellion is often caused by political, religious, or social grievances that originate from a perceived inequality or marginalization. &quot;Rebellion&quot; comes from Latin &quot;re&quot; and &quot;bellum&quot;, and in Lockian philosophy refers to the responsibility of the people to overthrow unjust government.

==Classification==


Uprisings which revolt, resisting and taking direct action against an authority, law or policy, as well as organize, are rebellions. 

An insurrection is an uprising to change the government. If a government does not recognize rebels as belligerents, then they are insurgents and the revolt is an insurgency. In a larger conflict, the rebels may be recognized as belligerents without their government being recognized by the established government, in which case the conflict becomes a civil war.

Civil resistance movements have often aimed at, and brought about, the fall of a government or head of state, and in these cases they could be considered a form of rebellion. In many of these cases, the opposition movement saw itself not only as nonviolent but also as upholding their country&#x27;s constitutional system against a government that was unlawful, for example if it had refused to acknowledge its defeat in an election. Thus, &quot;rebel&quot; does not always capture the element in some of these movements of acting to defend the rule of law and constitutionalism.

In contrast an attempt for an overthrow of a government by, and installation of a limited group of people is a putsch and by an elite a coup d’état.

If the existing system of society, like a government or its form is changed, it is most often called a revolution.

== Causes ==
=== Macro approach ===
The following theories broadly build on the Marxist interpretation of rebellion. Rebellion is studied, in Theda Skocpol&#x27;s words, by analyzing &quot;objective relationships and conflicts among variously situated groups and nations, rather than the interests, outlooks, or ideologies of particular actors in revolutions&quot;.

==== Marxist view ====
Karl Marx&#x27;s analysis of revolutions sees such expression of political violence not as anomic, episodic outbursts of discontents but rather the symptomatic expression of a particular set of objective but fundamentally contradicting class-based relations of power. The central tenet of Marxist philosophy, as expressed in , is the analysis of society&#x27;s mode of production (societal organization of technology and labor) and the relationships between people and their material conditions. Marx writes about &quot;the hidden structure of society&quot; that must be elucidated through an examination of &quot;the direct relationship of the owners of the conditions of production to the direct producers&quot;. The conflict that arises from producers being dispossessed of the means of production, and therefore subject to the possessors who may appropriate their products, is at the origin of the revolution.

The inner imbalance within these modes of production is derived from the conflicting modes of organization, such as capitalism emerging within feudalism, or more contemporarily socialism arising within capitalism. The dynamics engineered by these class frictions help class consciousness root itself in the collective imaginary. For example, the development of the bourgeoisie class went from an oppressed merchant class to urban independence, eventually gaining enough power to represent the state as a whole. Social movements are thus determined by an exogenous set of circumstances. The proletariat must also, according to Marx, go through the same process of self-determination which can only be achieved by friction against the bourgeoisie. In Marx&#x27;s theory, revolutions are the &quot;locomotives of history&quot; because revolution ultimately leads to the overthrow of a parasitic ruling class and its antiquated mode of production. Later, rebellion attempts to replace it with a new system of political economy, one that is better suited to the new ruling class, thus enabling societal progress. The cycle of revolution, thus, replaces one mode of production with another through the constant class friction.

==== Ted Gurr: Roots of political violence ====
In his book &quot;Why Men Rebel&quot;, Ted Gurr looks at the roots of political violence itself applied to a rebellion framework. He defines political violence as: &quot;all collective attacks within a political community against the political regime, its actors ... or its policies. The concept represents a set of events, a common property of which is the actual or threatened use of violence&quot;. Gurr sees in violence a voice of anger that manifests itself against the established order. More precisely, individuals become angry when they feel what Gurr labels as relative deprivation, meaning the feeling of getting less than one is entitled to. He labels it formally as the &quot;perceived discrepancy between value expectations and value capabilities&quot;. Gurr differentiates between three types of relative deprivation:
# &quot;Decremental deprivation&quot;: one&#x27;s capacities decrease when expectations remain high. One example of this is the proliferation and thus depreciation of the value of higher education.
# &quot;Aspirational Deprivation&quot;: one&#x27;s capacities stay the same when expectations rise. An example would be a first-generation college student lacking the contacts and network to obtain a higher paying job while watching her better-prepared colleagues bypass her.
# &quot;Progressive deprivation&quot;: expectation and capabilities increase but the former cannot keep up. A good example would be an automotive worker being increasingly marginalized by the automatization of the assembly line.
Anger is thus comparative. One of his key insights is that &quot;The potential for collective violence varies strongly with the intensity and scope of relative deprivation among members of a collectivity&quot;. This means that different individuals within society will have different propensities to rebel based on the particular internalization of their situation. As such, Gurr differentiates between three types of political violence:
# &quot;Turmoil&quot; when only the mass population encounters relative deprivation;
# &quot;Conspiracy&quot; when the population but especially the elite encounters relative deprivation;
# &quot;Internal War&quot;, which includes revolution. In this case, the degree of organization is much higher than turmoil, and the revolution is intrinsically spread to all sections of society, unlike the conspiracy.

==== Charles Tilly: Centrality of collective action ====
In &quot;From Mobilization to Revolution&quot;, Charles Tilly argues that political violence is a normal and endogenous reaction to competition for power between different groups within society. &quot;Collective violence&quot;, Tilly writes, &quot;is the product of just normal processes of competition among groups in order to obtain the power and implicitly to fulfill their desires&quot;. He proposes two models to analyze political violence:
# The &quot;polity&quot; model takes into account government and groups jockeying for control over power. Thus, both the organizations holding power and the ones challenging them are included. Tilly labels those two groups &quot;members&quot; and &quot;challengers&quot;. 
# The &quot;mobilization&quot; model aims to describe the behavior of one single party to the political struggle for power. Tilly further divides the model into two sub-categories, one that deals with the internal dynamics of the group, and the other that is concerned with the &quot;external relations&quot; of the entity with other organizations and/or the government. According to Tilly, the cohesiveness of a group mainly relies on the strength of common interests and the degree of organization. Thus, to answer Gurr, anger alone does not automatically create political violence. Political action is contingent on the capacity to organize and unite. It is far from irrational and spontaneous.
Revolutions are included in this theory, although they remain for Tilly particularly extreme since the challenger(s) aim for nothing less than full control over power. The &quot;revolutionary moment occurs when the population needs to choose to obey either the government or an alternative body who is engaged with the government in a zero-sum game. This is what Tilly calls &quot;multiple sovereignty&quot;. The success of a revolutionary movement hinges on &quot;the formation of coalitions between members of the polity and the contenders advancing exclusive alternative claims to control over Government.&quot;.

==== Chalmers Johnson and societal values ====
For Chalmers Johnson, rebellions are not so much the product of political violence or collective action but in &quot;the analysis of viable, functioning societies&quot;. In a quasi-biological manner, Johnson sees revolutions as symptoms of pathologies within the societal fabric. A healthy society, meaning a &quot;value-coordinated social system&quot; does not experience political violence. Johnson&#x27;s equilibrium is at the intersection between the need for society to adapt to changes but at the same time firmly grounded in selective fundamental values. The legitimacy of political order, he posits, relies exclusively on its compliance with these societal values and in its capacity to integrate and adapt to any change. Rigidity is, in other words, inadmissible. Johnson writes &quot;to make a revolution is to accept violence for the purpose of causing the system to change; more exactly, it is the purposive implementation of a strategy of violence in order to effect a change in social structure&quot;. The aim of a revolution is to re-align a political order on new societal values introduced by an externality that the system itself has not been able to process. Rebellions automatically must face a certain amount of coercion because by becoming &quot;de-synchronized&quot;, the now illegitimate political order will have to use coercion to maintain its position. A simplified example would be the French Revolution when the Parisian Bourgeoisie did not recognize the core values and outlook of the King as synchronized with its own orientations. More than the King itself, what really sparked the violence was the uncompromising intransigence of the ruling class. Johnson emphasizes &quot;the necessity of investigating a system&#x27;s value structure and its problems in order to conceptualize the revolutionary situation in any meaningful way&quot;.

==== Theda Skocpol and the autonomy of the state ====
Skocpol introduces the concept of the social revolution, to be contrasted with a political revolution. While the latter aims to change the polity, the former is &quot;rapid, basic transformations of a society&#x27;s state and class structures; and they are accompanied and in part carried through by class-based revolts from below&quot;. Social revolutions are a grassroots movement by nature because they do more than change the modalities of power, they aim to transform the fundamental social structure of society. As a corollary, this means that some &quot;revolutions&quot; may cosmetically change the organization of the monopoly over power without engineering any true change in the social fabric of society. Her analysis is limited to studying the French, Russian, and Chinese revolutions. Skocpol identifies three stages of the revolution in these cases (which she believes can be extrapolated and generalized), each accordingly accompanied by specific structural factors which in turn influence the social results of the political action: 
# &quot;The Collapse of the Old-Regime State&quot;: this is an automatic consequence of certain structural conditions. She highlights the importance of international military and economic competition as well as the pressure of the misfunctioning of domestic affairs. More precisely, she sees the breakdown of the governing structures of society influenced by two theoretical actors, the &quot;landed upper class&quot; and the &quot;imperial state&quot;. Both could be considered as &quot;partners in exploitation&quot; but in reality competed for resources: the state (monarchs) seek to build up military and economic power to ascertain their geopolitical influence. The upper class works in a logic of profit maximization, meaning preventing as much as possible the state to extract resources. All three revolutions occurred, Skocpol argues, because states failed to be able to &quot;mobilize extraordinary resources from the society and implement in the process reforms requiring structural transformations&quot;. The apparently contradicting policies were mandated by a unique set of geopolitical competition and modernization. &quot;Revolutionary political crises occurred because of the unsuccessful attempts of the Bourbon, Romanov, and Manchu regimes to cope with foreign pressures.&quot; Skocpol further concludes &quot;the upshot was the disintegration of centralized administrative and military machinery that had theretofore provided the solely unified bulwark of social and political order&quot;.
# &quot;Peasant Uprisings&quot;: more than simply a challenge by the landed upper class in a difficult context, the state needs to be challenged by mass peasant uprisings in order to fall. These uprisings must be aimed not at the political structures &quot;per se&quot; but at the upper class itself so that the political revolution becomes a social one as well. Skocpol quotes Barrington Moore who famously wrote: &quot;peasants [...] provided the dynamite to bring down the old building&quot;. Peasant uprisings are more effective depending on two given structural socioeconomic conditions: the level of autonomy (from both an economic and political point of view) peasant communities enjoy, and the degree of direct control the upper class on local politics. In other words, peasants must be able to have some degree of agency in order to be able to rebel. If the coercive structures of the state and/or the landowners keep a very close check on peasant activity, then there is no space to foment dissent. 
# &quot;Societal Transformation&quot;: this is the third and decisive step after the state organization has been seriously weakened and peasant revolts become widespread against landlords. The paradox of the three revolutions Skocpol studies is that stronger centralized and bureaucratic states emerge after the revolts. The exact parameters depend, again, on structural factors as opposed to voluntarist factors: in Russia, the new state found most support in the industrial base, rooting itself in cities. In China, most of the support for the revolt had been in the countryside, thus the new polity was grounded in rural areas. In France, the peasantry was not organized enough, and the urban centers not potent enough so that the new state was not firmly grounded in anything, partially explaining its artificiality. 
Here is a summary of the causes and consequences of social revolutions in these three countries according to Skocpol:
=== Microfoundational evidence on causes ===
The following theories are all based on Mancur Olson&#x27;s work in &quot;The Logic of Collective Action&quot;, a 1965 book that conceptualizes the inherent problem with an activity that has concentrated costs and diffuse benefits. In this case, the benefits of rebellion are seen as a public good, meaning one that is non-excludable and non-rivalrous. The political benefits are generally shared by all in society if a rebellion is successful, not just the individuals that have partaken in the rebellion itself. Olson thus challenges the assumption that simple interests in common are all that is necessary for collective action. In fact, he argues the &quot;free rider&quot; possibility, a term that means to reap the benefits without paying the price, will deter rational individuals from collective action. That is, unless there is a clear benefit, a rebellion will not happen en masse. Thus, Olson shows that &quot;selective incentives&quot;, only made accessible to individuals participating in the collective effort, can solve the free rider problem.

==== &quot;The Rational Peasant&quot; ====
Samuel L. Popkin builds on Olson&#x27;s argument in &quot;The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam.&quot; His theory is based on the figure of a hyper rational peasant that bases his decision to join (or not) a rebellion uniquely on a cost-benefit analysis. This formalist view of the collective action problem stresses the importance of individual economic rationality and self-interest: a peasant, according to Popkin, will disregard the ideological dimension of a social movement and focus instead on whether or not it will bring any practical benefit to him. According to Popkin, peasant society is based on a precarious structure of economic instability. Social norms, he writes, are &quot;malleable, renegotiated, and shifting in accord with considerations of power and strategic interaction among individuals&quot;.

The constant insecurity and inherent risk to the peasant condition, due to the peculiar nature of the patron-client relationship that binds the peasant to his landowner, forces the peasant to look inwards when he has a choice to make. Popkin argues that peasants rely on their &quot;private, family investment for their long run security and that they will be interested in short term gain vis-à-vis the village. They will attempt to improve their long-run security by moving to a position with higher income and less variance&quot;. Popkin stresses this &quot;investor logic&quot; that one may not expect in agrarian societies, usually seen as pre-capitalist communities where traditional social and power structures prevent the accumulation of capital. Yet, the selfish determinants of collective action are, according to Popkin, a direct product of the inherent instability of peasant life. The goal of a laborer, for example, will be to move to a tenant position, then smallholder, then landlord; where there is less variance and more income. Voluntarism is thus non-existent in such communities.

Popkin singles out four variables that impact individual participation:
# Contribution to the expenditure of resources: collective action has a cost in terms of contribution, and especially if it fails (an important consideration with regards to rebellion) 
# Rewards : the direct (more income) and indirect (less oppressive central state) rewards for collective action 
# Marginal impact of the peasant&#x27;s contribution to the success of collective action
# Leadership &quot;viability and trust&quot; : to what extent the resources pooled will be effectively used.
Without any moral commitment to the community, this situation will engineer free riders. Popkin argues that selective incentives are necessary to overcome this problem.

===== Opportunity cost of rebellion =====
Political Scientist Christopher Blattman and World Bank economist Laura Ralston identify rebellious activity as an &quot;occupational choice&quot;. They draw a parallel between criminal activity and rebellion, arguing that the risks and potential payoffs an individual must calculate when making the decision to join such a movement remains similar between the two activities. In both cases, only a selected few reap important benefits, while most of the members of the group do not receive similar payoffs. The choice to rebel is inherently linked with its opportunity cost, namely what an individual is ready to give up in order to rebel. Thus, the available options beside rebellious or criminal activity matter just as much as the rebellion itself when the individual makes the decision. Blattman and Ralston, however, recognize that &quot;a poor person&#x27;s best strategy&quot; might be both rebellion illicit and legitimate activities at the same time. Individuals, they argue, can often have a varied &quot;portofolio&quot; of activities, suggesting that they all operate on a rational, profit maximizing logic. The authors conclude that the best way to fight rebellion is to increase its opportunity cost, both by more enforcement but also by minimizing the potential material gains of a rebellion.

===== Selective incentives based on group membership =====
The decision to join a rebellion can be based on the prestige and social status associated with membership in the rebellious group. More than material incentives for the individual, rebellions offer their members club goods, public goods that are reserved only for the members inside that group. Economist Eli Berman and Political Scientist David D. Laitin&#x27;s study of radical religious groups show that the appeal of club goods can help explain individual membership. Berman and Laitin discuss suicide operations, meaning acts that have the highest cost for an individual. They find that in such a framework, the real danger to an organization is not volunteering but preventing defection. Furthermore, the decision to enroll in such high stakes organization can be rationalized. Berman and Laitin show that religious organizations supplant the state when it fails to provide an acceptable quality of public goods such a public safety, basic infrastructure, access to utilities, or schooling. Suicide operations &quot;can be explained as a costly signal of &quot;commitment&quot; to the community&quot;. They further note &quot;Groups less adept at extracting signals of commitment (sacrifices) may not be able to consistently enforce incentive compatibility.&quot; Thus, rebellious groups can organize themselves to &quot;ask&quot; of members proof of commitment to the cause. Club goods serve not so much to coax individuals into joining but to prevent defection.

===== Greed vs grievance model =====

World Bank economists Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler compare two dimensions of incentives:
# Greed rebellion: &quot;motivated by predation of the rents from primary commodity exports, subject to an economic calculus of costs and a military survival constraint&quot;.
# Grievance rebellion: &quot;motivated by hatreds which might be intrinsic to ethnic and religious differences, or reflected objective resentments such as domination by an ethnic majority, political repression, or economic inequality&quot;. The two main sources of grievance are political exclusion and inequality.
Vollier and Hoeffler find that the model based on grievance variables systematically fails to predict past conflicts, while the model based on greed performs well. The authors posit that the high cost of risk to society is not taken into account seriously by the grievance model: individuals are fundamentally risk-averse. However, they allow that conflicts create grievances, which in turn can become risk factors. Contrary to established beliefs, they also find that a multiplicity of ethnic communities make society safer, since individuals will be automatically more cautious, at the opposite of the grievance model predictions. Finally, the authors also note that the grievances expressed by members of the diaspora of a community in turmoil has an important on the continuation of violence. Both greed and grievance thus need to be included in the reflection.

==== &quot;The Moral Economy of the Peasant&quot; ====
Spearheaded by political scientist and anthropologist James C. Scott in his book &quot;The Moral Economy of the Peasant&quot;, the moral economy school considers moral variables such as social norms, moral values, interpretation of justice, and conception of duty to the community as the prime influencers of the decision to rebel. This perspective still adheres to Olson&#x27;s framework, but it considers different variables to enter the cost/benefit analysis: the individual is still believed to be rational, albeit not on material but moral grounds.

===== Early conceptualization: E. P. Thompson and bread riots in England =====
British historian E.P. Thompson is often cited as being the first to use the term &quot;moral economy&quot;, he said in his 1991 publication that the term had been in use since the 18th century. In his 1971 &quot;Past &amp; Present&quot; journal article, &quot;Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century&quot;, he discussed English bread riots, and other localized form of rebellion by English peasants throughout the 18th century. He said that these events have been routinely dismissed as &quot;riotous&quot;, with the connotation of being disorganized, spontaneous, undirected, and undisciplined. He wrote that, on the contrary, such riots involved a coordinated peasant action, from the pillaging of food convoys to the seizure of grain shops. A scholar such as Popkin has argued that peasants were trying to gain material benefits, such as more food. Thompson sees a legitimization factor, meaning &quot;a belief that [the peasants] were defending traditional rights and customs&quot;. Thompson goes on to write that &quot;[the riots were] legitimized by the assumptions of an older moral economy, which taught the immorality of any unfair method of forcing up the price of provisions by profiteering upon the necessities of the people&quot;. In 1991, twenty years after his original publication, Thompson said that his, &quot;object of analysis was the &quot;mentalité&quot;, or, as [he] would prefer, the political culture, the expectations, traditions, and indeed, superstitions of the working population most frequently involved in actions in the market.&quot; The opposition between a traditional, paternalist, and the communitarian set of values clashing with the inverse liberal, capitalist, and market-derived ethics is central to explain rebellion.

===== James C. Scott and the formalization of the moral economy argument =====
In his 1976 book &quot;The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia&quot;, James C. Scott looks at the impact of exogenous economic and political shocks on peasant communities in Southeast Asia. Scott finds that peasants are mostly in the business of surviving and producing enough to subsist. Therefore, any extractive regime needs to respect this careful equilibrium. He labels this phenomenon the &quot;subsistence ethic&quot;. A landowner operating in such communities is seen to have the moral duty to prioritize the peasant&#x27;s subsistence over his constant benefit. According to Scott, the powerful colonial state accompanied by market capitalism did not respect this fundamental hidden law in peasant societies. Rebellious movements occurred as the reaction to an emotional grief, a moral outrage.

===== Other non-material incentives =====
Blattman and Ralston recognize the importance of immaterial selective incentives, such as anger, outrage, and injustice (&quot;grievance&quot;) in the roots of rebellions. These variables, they argue, are far from being irrational, as they are sometimes presented. They identify three main types of grievance arguments:

# &quot;Intrinsic incentives&quot; holds that &quot;injustice or perceived transgression generates an intrinsic willingness to punish or seek retribution&quot;. More than material rewards, individuals are naturally and automatically prompted to fight for justice if they feel they have been wronged. The ultimatum game is an excellent illustration: player one receives $10 and must split it with another player who does not get the chance to determine how much he receives, but only if the deal is made or not (if he refuses, everyone loses their money). Rationally, player 2 should take whatever the deal is because it is better in absolute term ($1 more remains $1 more). However, player 2 is most likely unwilling to accept less than 2 or 2 dollars, meaning that they are willing to pay a-$2 for justice to be respected. This game, according to Blattman and Ralston, represents &quot;the expressive pleasure people gain from punishing an injustice&quot;.
# &quot;Loss aversion&quot; holds that &quot;people tend to evaluate their satisfaction relative to a reference point, and that they are &#x27;loss adverse&quot;. Individuals prefer not losing over the risky strategy of making gains. There is a substantial subjective part to this, however, as some may realize alone and decide that they are comparatively less well off than a neighbor, for example. To &quot;fix&quot; this gap, individuals will in turn be ready to take great risks so as to not enshrine a loss.
# &quot;Frustration-aggression&quot;: this model holds that the immediate emotional reactions to highly stressful environments do not obey to any &quot;direct utility benefit but rather a more impulsive and emotional response to a threat&quot;. There are limits to this theory: violent action is to a large extent a product of goals by an individual which are in turn determined by a set of preferences. Yet, this approach shows that contextual elements like economic precarity have a non-negligible impact on the conditions of the decisions to rebel at minimum.

== Recruitment ==
Stathis N. Kalyvas, a political science professor at Yale University, argues that political violence is heavily influenced by hyperlocal socio-economic factors, from the mundane traditional family rivalries to repressed grudges. Rebellion, or any sort of political violence, are not binary conflicts but must be understood as interactions between public and private identities and actions. The &quot;convergence of local motives and supralocal imperatives&quot; make studying and theorizing rebellion a very complex affair, at the intersection between the political and the private, the collective and the individual.
Kalyvas argues that we often try to group political conflicts according to two structural paradigms:
# The idea that political violence, and more specifically rebellion, is characterized by a complete breakdown of authority and an anarchic state. This is inspired by Thomas Hobbes&#x27; views. The approach sees rebellion as being motivated by greed and loot, using violence to break down the power structures of society.
# The idea that all political violence is inherently motivated by an abstract group of loyalties and beliefs, &quot;whereby the political enemy becomes a private adversary only by virtue of prior collective and impersonal enmity&quot;. Violence is thus not a &quot;man to man&quot; affair as much as a &quot;state to state&quot; struggle, if not an &quot;idea vs idea&quot; conflict.
Kalyvas&#x27; key insight is that the central vs periphery dynamic is fundamental in political conflicts. Any individual actor, Kalyvas posits, enters into a calculated &quot;alliance&quot; with the collective. Rebellions thus cannot be analyzed in molar categories, nor should we assume that individuals are automatically in line with the rest of the actors simply by virtue of ideological, religious, ethnic, or class cleavage. The agency is located both within the collective and in the individual, in the universal and the local. Kalyvas writes: &quot;Alliance entails a &quot;transaction&quot; between supralocal and local actors, whereby the former supply the later with external muscle, thus allowing them to win decisive local advantage, in exchange the former rely on local conflicts to recruit and motivate supporters and obtain local control, resources, and information- even when their ideological agenda is opposed to localism&quot;. Individuals will thus aim to use the rebellion in order to gain some sort of local advantage, while the collective actors will aim to gain power. Violence is a mean as opposed to a goal, according to Kalyvas.

The greater takeaway from this central/local analytical lens is that violence is not an anarchic tactic or a manipulation by an ideology, but a conversation between the two. Rebellions are &quot;concatenations of multiple and often disparate local cleavages, more or less loosely arranged around the master cleavage&quot;. Any pre-conceived explanation or theory of a conflict must not be placated on a situation, lest one will construct a reality that adapts itself to his pre-conceived idea. Kalyvas thus argues that political conflict is not always political in the sense that they cannot be reduced to a certain discourse, decisions, or ideologies from the &quot;center&quot; of collective action. Instead, the focus must be on &quot;local cleavages and intracommunity dynamics&quot;. Furthermore, rebellion is not &quot;a mere mechanism that opens up the floodgates to random and anarchical private violence&quot;. Rather, it is the result of a careful and precarious alliance between local motivations and collective vectors to help the individual cause.

==Rebel governance==
Rebel governance is the development of institutions, rules and norms by rebel groups with an intent to regulate civilians&#x27; social, economic and political life, usually in areas under the territorial control of the rebel groups. Rebel governance may include systems of taxation, regulations on social conduct, judicial systems, and public goods provision.

==Peace agreements==
One third of rebel leaders who sign peace agreements with the state experience exile, imprisonment, or unnatural death while two thirds go into regular politics or pursue further rebellion.

<doc id="513248" wikidata="Q33537" url="?curid=513248" title="Lakota language">
<text>Lakota ( ), also referred to as Lakhota, Teton or Teton Sioux, is a Siouan language spoken by the Lakota people of the Sioux tribes. Lakota is mutually intelligible with the two dialects of the Dakota language, especially Western Dakota, and is one of the three major varieties of the Sioux language.

Speakers of the Lakota language make up one of the largest Native American language speech communities in the United States, with approximately 2,000 speakers, who live mostly in the northern plains states of North Dakota and South Dakota. Many communities have immersion programs for both children and adults.

Like many indigenous languages, the Lakota language did not have a written form traditionally. However, efforts to develop a written form of Lakota began, primarily through the work of Christian missionaries and linguists, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The orthography has since evolved to reflect contemporary needs and usage.

One significant figure in the development of a written form of Lakota was Ella Cara Deloria, also called Aŋpétu Wašté Wiŋ (Beautiful Day Woman), a Yankton Dakota ethnologist, linguist, and novelist who worked extensively with the Dakota and Lakota peoples, documenting their languages and cultures. She collaborated with linguists such as Franz Boas and Edward Sapir to create written materials for Lakota, including dictionaries and grammars.

Another key figure was Albert White Hat Sr., who taught at and later became the chair of the Lakota language program at his alma mater, Sinte Gleska University at Mission, South Dakota, one of the first tribal-based universities in the US. His work focused on the Sicangu dialect using an orthography developed by Lakota in 1982 and which today is slowly supplanting older systems provided by linguists and missionaries.

==History and origin==
The Lakota people&#x27;s creation stories say that language originated from the creation of the tribe. Other creation stories say language was invented by Iktomi.

A wholly Lakota newspaper named the &quot;Anpao Kin&quot; (&quot;Daybreak&quot;) circulated from 1878 by the Protestant Episcopal Church in Niobrara Mission, Nebraska until its move to Mission, South Dakota in 1908 continuing until its closure in 1937. The print alongside its Dakota counterpart &quot;Iapi Oaye&quot; (&quot;The Word Carrier&quot;) played an important role in documenting the enlistment and affairs including obituaries of Native Sioux soldiers into the army as America became involved in World War I.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
Lakota has five oral vowels, , and three nasal vowels, (phonetically ). Lakota and are said to be more open than the corresponding cardinal vowels, perhaps closer to and . Orthographically, the nasal vowels are written with a following , , or ; historically, these were written with ogoneks underneath, . No syllables end with consonantal .

A neutral vowel (schwa) is automatically inserted between certain consonants, e.g. into the pairs , and . So the clan name written phonemically as has become the place name &quot;Ogallala&quot;.

===Consonants===
The voiced uvular fricative becomes a uvular trill () before and in fast speech it is often realized as a voiced velar fricative . The voiceless aspirated plosives have two allophonic variants each: those with a delay in voicing , and those with velar friction , which occur before , , , , and (thus, , is phonetically ). For some speakers, there is a phonemic distinction between the two, and both occur before . No such variation occurs for the affricate /tʃʰ/. Some orthographies mark this distinction; others do not. The uvular fricatives and are commonly spelled and .

All monomorphemic words have one vowel which carries primary stress and has a higher tone than all other vowels in the word. This is generally the vowel of the second syllable of the word, but often the first syllable can be stressed, and occasionally other syllables as well. Stress is generally indicated with an acute accent: , etc. Compound words will have stressed vowels in each component; proper spelling will write compounds with a hyphen. Thus , literally &quot;metal-white&quot;, i.e. &quot;silver; money&quot; has two stressed vowels, the first &quot;a&quot; in each component. If it were written without the hyphen, as , it would imply a single main stress.

===Phonological processes===

A common phonological process which occurs in rapid speech is &quot;vowel contraction&quot;, which generally results from the loss of an intervocalic glide. Vowel contraction results in phonetic long vowels (phonemically a sequence of two identical vowels), with falling pitch if the first underlying vowel is stressed, and rising pitch if the second underlying vowel is stressed: &quot;kê:&quot; (falling tone), &quot;he said that&quot;, from ; &quot;hǎ:pi&quot; (rising tone), &quot;clothing&quot;, from . If one of the vowels is nasalized, the resulting long vowel is also nasalized: &quot;čhaŋ̌:pi&quot;, &quot;sugar&quot;, from .

When two vowels of unequal height contract, or when feature contrasts exist between the vowels and the glide, two new phonetic vowels, and , result: &quot;iyæ̂:&quot;, &quot;he left for there&quot;, from ; &quot;mitȟa:&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s mine&quot;, from .

The plural enclitic &quot;=pi&quot; is frequently changed in rapid speech when preceding the enclitics &quot;=kte&quot;, &quot;=kiŋ&quot;, &quot;=kštó&quot;, or &quot;=na&quot;. If the vowel preceding &quot;=pi&quot; is high/open, &quot;=pi&quot; becomes [u]; if the vowel is non-high (mid or closed), &quot;=pi&quot; becomes [o] (if the preceding vowel is nasalized, then the resulting vowel is also nasalized): &quot;hi=pi=kte&quot;, &quot;they will arrive here&quot;, [hiukte]; &quot;yatkáŋ=pi=na&quot;, &quot;they drank it and...&quot;, .

Lakota also exhibits some traces of sound symbolism among fricatives, where the point of articulation changes to reflect intensity: , &quot;it&#x27;s yellow&quot;, , &quot;it&#x27;s tawny&quot;, , &quot;it&#x27;s brown&quot;. (Compare with the similar examples in Mandan.)

==Orthographies, standardization, and teaching materials==
Several orthographies as well as &quot;ad hoc&quot; spelling are used to write the Lakota language, with varying perspectives on whether standardization should be implemented. In 2002, Rosebud Cultural Studies teacher Randy Emery argued that standardization of the language could cause problems &quot;because the language is utilized diversely. If standardization is determined to be the approach... then the question is whose version will be adopted? This will cause dissent and politics to become a factor in the process.&quot;

Also in 2002, Sinte Gleska University rejected a partnership with the European-owned Lakota Language Consortium. Sinte Gleska uses the orthography developed by Albert White Hat, which on December 13, 2012, was formally adopted by the Rosebud Sioux Tribe per Tribal Resolution No. 2012–343. This resolution also banned the Lakota Language Consortium and its &quot;Czech orthography&quot; from the reservation and its educational system. This ban was a response to a series of protests by community members and grassroots language preservation workers, at Rosebud and other Lakota communities, against the Lakota Language Consortium (LLC). Despite its name, the LLC is an organization formed by two Europeans. Concerns arose due to the LLC&#x27;s promotion of their &quot;New Lakota Dictionary&quot;, websites and other Internet projects aimed at revising and standardizing their new spelling of the Lakota language. &quot;Lakota first language speakers and Lakota language teachers criticize the &quot;Czech orthography&quot; for being overloaded with markings and – foremost – for the way it is being brought into Lakota schools&quot;; it has been criticized as &quot;neocolonial domination.&quot; Sonja John writes that &quot;The new orthography the Czech linguist advocates resembles the Czech orthography – making it easier for Czech people to read. The Europeans predominantly use the internet to give the impression that this &quot;Czech orthography&quot; is a Lakota product and the standard for writing Lakota.&quot; &quot;The Rosebud Sioux Tribe was the first of the Lakota tribes to take legal action against the self-authorizing practices the LLC committed by utilizing names of Lakota language experts without their consent to obtain funding for their projects.&quot; Rosebud Resolution No. 2008–295 goes further and compares these actions to what was done to children taken from their families by the residential schools.

In 2006 some of the Lakota language teachers at Standing Rock chose to collaborate with Sitting Bull College, and the Lakota Language Consortium (LLC), with the aim of expanding their language curriculum. Teachers at Standing Rock use several different orthographies. Language activists at Standing Rock also refer to it as simply the &quot;SLO&quot; or even &quot;Suggested Lakota Orthography.&quot; Tasha Hauff writes,
In 2013 Lakota teachers at Red Cloud Indian School on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation discussed their use of orthography for their K–12 students as well as adult learners. The orthography used at Red Cloud &quot;is meant to be more phonetic than other orthographies... That means there are usually more &#x27;H&#x27;s than other versions. While many orthographies use tipi... Red Cloud spells it thípi.&quot; He continues, &quot;the orthography also makes heavy use of diacritical marks... that is not popular among some educators and academics&quot;. Delphine Red Shirt, an Oglala Lakota tribal member and a lecturer on languages at Stanford University, disagrees and prefers a Lakota orthography without diacritical marks. &quot;I&#x27;m very against any orthography that requires a special keyboard to communicate,&quot; she said. First language speaker and veteran language teacher at Red Cloud, the late Philomine Lakota, had similar concerns with the orthography, and argues against changing the spelling forms she learned from her father. However, she did consider that, a shared curriculum could &quot;create consistency across the region and encourage the long-term viability of the language. However, Philomine is also cognizant that it will take more than a school curriculum to preserve the language.&quot; She added, &quot;In order for a language to survive, it can&#x27;t simply be taught from the top. A language is a living thing and students need to breathe life into it daily; talking with friends, family and elders in Lakota&quot;.

In 2018, at the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation, Lakota speaker Manny Iron Hawk and his wife Renee Iron Hawk discussed opening an immersion school and the difficulties around choosing an orthography to write Lakota; Mr. Iron Hawk voiced support for the LLC (SLO) Orthography, saying it was accessible to second language learners, but know not all agreed with him. Others in the community voiced a preference for the tribe creating their own orthography. While Mr. Iron Hawk supports this approach, Renee Iron Hawk also expressed a sense of urgency, saying &quot;We should just use what we have, and then fix and replace it, but we need to start speaking it now&quot;. The Iron Hawks both agreed that too much time has been spent arguing over which orthography to use or not use, and not enough time is spent teaching and speaking the language.

On May 3, 2022, the Tribal Council of the Standing Rock Sioux, in a near-unanimous vote, banished the Lakota Language Consortium (and specifically, LLC linguist Jan Ullrich and co-founder Wilhelm Meya) from ever again setting foot on the reservation. The council&#x27;s decision was based on the LLC&#x27;s history with not only the Standing Rock community, but also with at least three other communities that also voiced concerns about Meya and the LLC, &quot;saying he broke agreements over how to use recordings, language materials and historical records, or used them without permission.&quot;

=== LLC alphabet ===

The &quot;Standard Lakota Orthography&quot; as the LLC calls it, is in principle phonemic, which means that each character (grapheme) represents one distinctive sound (phoneme), except for the distinction between glottal and velar aspiration, which is treated phonetically.

Lakota vowels are nasal vowels are &quot;aŋ, iŋ, uŋ.&quot; Pitch accent is marked with an acute accent: on stressed vowels (which receive a higher tone than non-stressed ones)

The following consonants approximate their IPA values: . has its English value of . An apostrophe, , is used for the glottal stop.

A caron is used for sounds, other than , which are not written with Latin letters in the IPA: , , , , . Aspirates are written with : and velar frication with : Ejectives are written with an apostrophe: .

The spelling used in modern popular texts is often written without diacritics. Besides failing to mark stress, this also results in the confusion of numerous consonants: and are both written , and are both written , and the aspirate stops are written like the unaspirates, as .


All digraphs (i.e. characters created by two letters, such as kh, kȟ, k&#x27;) are treated as groups of individual letters in alphabetization. Thus for example the word precedes in a dictionary.

=== Curley alphabet ===
In 1982, Lakota educator Leroy Curley (1935–2012) devised a 41-letter circular alphabet.

==Grammar==

===Word order===

The basic word order of Lakota is subject–object–verb, although the order can be changed for expressive purposes (placing the object before the subject to bring the object into focus or placing the subject after the verb to emphasize its status as established information). It is postpositional, with adpositions occurring after the head nouns: , &quot;at the store&quot; (literally &#x27;store at&#x27;); , &quot;around the house&quot; (literally &#x27;house=the around&#x27;) (Rood and Taylor 1996).

Rood and Taylor (1996) suggest the following template for basic word order. Items in parentheses are optional; only the verb is required. It is therefore possible to produce a grammatical sentence that contains only a verb.
(interjection) (conjunction) (adverb(s)) (nominal) (nominal) (nominal) (adverb(s)) verb (enclitic(s)) (conjunction)

===Interjections===

When interjections are used, they begin the sentence or end it. A small number of interjections are used only by one gender, for instance the interjection expressing disbelief is for women but for men; for calling attention women say while men use . Most interjections, however, are used by both genders.

===Conjunctions===

It is common for a sentence to begin with a conjunction. Both and can be translated as &quot;and&quot;; is similar to English &quot;but&quot;. Each of these conjunctions joins clauses. In addition, the conjunction joins nouns or phrases.

===Adverbs, postpositions and derived modifiers===

Lakota uses postpositions, which are similar to English prepositions, but follow their noun complement. Adverbs or postpositional phrases can describe manner, location, or reason. There are also interrogative adverbs, which are used to form questions.

====Synonymity in the postpositions and ====

To the non-Lakota speaker, the postpositions and sound like they can be interchangeable, but although they are full synonyms of each other, they are used in different occasions. Semantically (word meaning), they are used as locational and directional tools. In the English language they can be compared to prepositions like &quot;at&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, and &quot;on&quot; (when used as locatives) on the one hand, and &quot;at&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, and &quot;on&quot; (when used as directionals), &quot;to&quot;, &quot;into&quot;, and &quot;onto&quot;, on the other. (Pustet 2013)

A pointer for when to use and when to use can be determined by the concepts of location (motionless) or motion; and space vs. time. These features can produce four different combinations, also called semantic domains, which can be arranged as follows (Pustet 2013):

# space / rest: &quot;in the house&quot; [thípi kiŋ él] (This sentence is only describing location of an object, no movement indicated)
# space / motion: &quot;to the house [thípi kiŋ ektá] (This sentence is referring to movement of a subject, it is directional in nature)
# time / rest: &quot;in the winter&quot; [waníyetu kiŋ él] (This sentence refers to a static moment in time, which happens to be during winter)
# time / motion: &quot;in/towards the winter&quot; [waníyetu kiŋ ektá] (Pustet 2013) (This sentence is delegated to time, but time which is soon to change to another season)

Summed up, when a context describes no motion, is the appropriate postposition; when in motion, is more appropriate. They are both used in matters of time and space.

===Nouns and pronouns===

As mentioned above, nominals are optional in Lakota, but when nouns appear the basic word order is subject–object–verb. Pronouns are not common, but may be used contrastively or emphatically.

Lakota has four articles: is indefinite, similar to English &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot;, and is definite, similar to English &quot;the&quot;. In addition, is an indefinite article used with hypothetical or irrealis objects, and is a definite article used with nouns that have been mentioned previously.

===Demonstratives===

There are also nine demonstratives, which can function either as pronouns or as determiners.

===Verbs===

Verbs are the only word class that are obligatory in a Lakota sentence. Verbs can be active, naming an action, or stative, describing a property. (In English, such descriptions are usually made with adjectives.)

Verbs are inflected for first-, second- or third person, and for singular, dual or plural grammatical number.

===Morphology===

====Verb inflection====

There are two paradigms for verb inflection. One set of morphemes indicates the person and number of the subject of active verbs. The other set of morphemes agrees with the object of transitive action verbs &quot;or&quot; the subject of stative verbs.

Most of the morphemes in each paradigm are prefixes, but plural subjects are marked with a suffix and third-person plural objects with an infix.

First person arguments may be singular, dual, or plural; second or third person arguments may be singular or plural.

Examples: &quot;máni&quot; &quot;He walks.&quot; &quot;mánipi&quot; &quot;They walk.&quot;

Example: &quot;waŋwíčhayaŋke&quot; &quot;He looked at them&quot; from &quot;waŋyáŋkA&quot; &quot;to look at something/somebody&quot;.

Subject and object pronouns in one verb
If both the subject and object need to be marked, two affixes occur on the verb. Below is a table illustrating this. Subject affixes are marked in &quot;italics&quot; and object affixes are marked in underline. Some affixes encompass both subject and object (such as &quot;čhi&quot;- ...). The symbol ∅ indicates a lack of marking for a particular subject/object (as in the case of 3rd Person Singular forms). Cells with three forms indicate Class I, Class II, and Class III verb forms in this order.

*1 The affix &quot;čhi&quot;- covers cases where I-subject and you-object occurs in transitive verbs.
*2 Class II and Class III verbs have irregular &quot;yal&quot;- and &quot;yan&quot;- respectively.
*3 These prefixes are separated when &quot;uŋ(k)&quot;- must be prefixed while &quot;ni&quot;- et al. must be infixed.
Example: &quot;uŋkánipȟepi&quot; &quot;We are waiting for you&quot; from &quot;apȟé&quot; &quot;to wait for somebody&quot;.
*4 &quot;uŋ(k)&quot;- precedes all affixes except &quot;wičha&quot;-. In the last column, verbs which require &quot;uŋ(k)&quot;- to be prefixed are more complex because of competing rules: &quot;uŋ(k)&quot;- must be prefixed, but must also follow &quot;wičha&quot;-. Most speakers resolve this issue by infixing &quot;wičhauŋ(k)&quot; after the initial vowel, then repeating the initial vowel again.
Example: &quot;iwíčhauŋkičupi&quot; &quot;We took them&quot; from &quot;ičú&quot; &quot;to take something/somebody&quot;.
*5 Since the suffix -&quot;pi&quot; can appear only once in each verb, but may pluralize either subject or object (or both), some ambiguity exists in the forms: &quot;uŋ- ... -pi&quot;, &quot;uŋni- ... -pi&quot;, and &quot;uŋya-/uŋl-/uŋn- ... -pi&quot;.

====Enclitics====

Lakota has a number of enclitic particles which follow the verb, many of which differ depending on whether the speaker is male or female.

Some enclitics indicate the aspect, mood, or number of the verb they follow. There are also various interrogative enclitics, which in addition to marking an utterance as a question show finer distinctions of meaning. For example, while &quot;he&quot; is the usual question-marking enclitic, &quot;huŋwó&quot; is used for rhetorical questions or in formal oratory, and the dubitative &quot;wa&quot; functions somewhat like a tag question in English (Rood and Taylor 1996; Buchel 1983). (See also the section below on men and women&#x27;s speech.)

====Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s speech====

A small number of enclitics (approximately eight) differ in form based on the gender of the speaker. &quot;Yeló&quot; (men) &quot;ye&quot; (women) mark mild assertions. &quot;Kštó&quot; (women only according to most sources) marks strong assertion. &quot;Yo&quot; (men) and &quot;ye&quot; (women) mark neutral commands, &quot;yetȟó&quot; (men) and &quot;nitȟó&quot; (women) mark familiar, and &quot;ye&quot; (both men and women) and &quot;na&quot; mark requests. &quot;He&quot; is used by both genders to mark direct questions, but men also use &quot;hųwó&quot; in more formal situations. &quot;So&quot; (men) and &quot;se&quot; (women) mark dubitative questions (where the person being asked is not assumed to know the answer).

While many native speakers and linguists agree that certain enclitics are associated with particular genders, such usage may not be exclusive. That is, individual men sometimes use enclitics associated with women, and vice versa (Trechter 1999).

===Ablaut===
*All examples are taken from the &quot;New Lakota Dictionary&quot;.

The term &quot;ablaut&quot; refers to the tendency of some words to change their final vowel in certain situations. Compare these sentences.

* &quot;Šúŋka kiŋ sápa čha waŋbláke.&quot;
* &quot;Šúŋka kiŋ sápe.&quot;
* &quot;Šúŋka kiŋ sápiŋ na tȟáŋka.&quot;

The last vowel in the word &quot;SápA&quot; changed each time. This vowel change is called &quot;ablaut&quot;. Words which undergo this change are referred to as A-words, since, in dictionary citations, they are written ending in either -A or -Aŋ. These words are never written with a final capital letter in actual texts. Derivatives of these words generally take the ablaut as well, however there are exceptions.

There are three forms for ablauted words: &quot;-a/-aŋ&quot;, &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;-iŋ&quot;. These are referred to as a/aŋ-ablaut, e-ablaut, and iŋ-ablaut respectively. Some words are ablauted by some and not others, like &quot;gray&quot; &quot;hóta&quot; or &quot;hótA&quot;. Ablaut always depends on what word follows the ablauted word.

====A/aŋ-ablaut====

This is the basic form of the word, and is used everywhere in which the other forms are not utilized.

====E-ablaut====

There are two cases in which e-ablaut is used.
# Last word in the sentence
# Followed by a word which triggers e-ablaut

=====1. Last word in sentence=====
;Examples
:&quot;Héčhiya yé&quot; He went there. (e-ablaut of the verb &quot;yÁ&quot;)
:&quot;Yúte&quot; She ate it. (e-ablaut of the verb &quot;yútA&quot;)
:&quot;Thípi kiŋ pahá akáŋl hé.&quot; The house stands on a cliff. (e-ablaut of the verb &quot;hÁŋ&quot;)

=====2. Followed by a word which triggers e-ablaut=====
There are three classes of words which trigger e-ablaut

# various enclitics, such as &quot;ȟča, ȟčiŋ, iŋčhéye, kačháš, kiló, kštó, któk, lakȟa, -la, láȟ, láȟčaka, ló, séčA, sékse, s’eléčheča, so, s’a, s’e, šaŋ, šni, uŋštó&quot;
# some conjunctions and articles, such as &quot;kiŋ, kiŋháŋ, k’éaš, k’uŋ, eháŋtaŋš&quot;
# some auxiliary verbs, such as &quot;kapíŋ, kiníča (kiníl), lakA (la), kúŋzA, phiča, ši, wačhíŋ, -yA, -khiyA&quot;

;Examples

:&quot;Škáte šni.&quot; He did not play. (enclitic)
:&quot;Škáte s’a.&quot; He plays often. (enclitic)
:&quot;Škáte ló.&quot; He plays. (enclitic (marking assertion))

:&quot;Yatké-phiča.&quot; It is drinkable. (auxiliary verb)

====Iŋ-ablaut====

The &quot;iŋ&quot;-ablaut (pronounced &quot;i&quot; by some) occurs only before the following words:

: &quot;ktA&quot; (irrealis enclitic)
: &quot;yetȟó&quot; (familiar command enclitic)
: &quot;na, naháŋ&quot; (and)
: &quot;naíŋš&quot; (or, and or)
: &quot;yé&quot; (polite request or entreaty enclitic)

;Examples

:&quot;Waŋyáŋkiŋ yetȟó.&quot; Take a look at this, real quick.
:&quot;Yíŋ kte.&quot; She will go.
:&quot;Skúyiŋ na wašté.&quot; It was sweet and good.
:&quot;Waŋyáŋkiŋ yé.&quot; Please, look at it.

==Phrases==

&quot;Háu kȟolá&quot;, literally &quot;Hello, friend&quot;, is the most common greeting, and was transformed into the generic motion picture American Indian &quot;How!&quot;, just as the traditional feathered headdress of the Teton was &quot;given&quot; to all movie Indians. As &quot;háu&quot; is the only word in Lakota which contains a diphthong, , it may be a loanword from a non-Siouan language.

== Language revitalization efforts ==

Assimilating Indigenous peoples into the expanding American society of the late 19th and early 20th centuries depended on suppression or full eradication of each tribe&#x27;s unique language as the central aspect of its culture. Indian residential schools in the US and Canada that separated Indigenous children from their parents and relatives enforced this assimilation process with beatings and other forms of violence for speaking tribal languages(Powers). The Lakota language survived this suppression. &quot;Lakota persisted through the recognized natural immersion afforded by daily conversation in the home, the community at reservation-wide events, even in texts written in the form of letters to family and friends. people demonstrated their cultural resilience through the positive application of spoken and written Lakota.&quot; (Powers)

Even so, employment opportunities were based on speaking English; a Lakota who was bilingual or spoke only English was more likely to be hired.

In 1967, the Red Cloud Indian School at Pine Ridge began offering Lakota language classes. This was over two decades before the Native American Languages Act of 1990.

In the mid-1970s the Rosebud Reservation established their Lakota Language and Culture department at the Sinte Gleska University under the chairmanship of Ben Black Bear, Jr., who employed textbooks and orthography developed by the Colorado University Lakota Project (CULP). A few years later Black Bear was replaced as a chair of the department by Albert White Hat, who discontinued the use of the Colorado University textbooks. In 1992 White Hat published a textbook with his own orthography, for use at all levels of language learning on Rosebud. Sinte Gleska University now uses the orthography developed by Albert White Hat.

In 2002 Sinte Gleska University rejected the Lakota Language Consortium invitation to support their organization. Rosebud Cultural Studies teacher Randy Emery spoke to the &quot;Lakota Journal&quot;, stating, &quot;The Lakota Language Consortium has created the misleading impression that Sinte Gleska University is one of the schools that supports their organization,&quot; and that the LLC had circulated a document to this effect with other misleading information about the state of the language, &quot;The (LLC) documentation strongly implies that there are no fluent speakers younger than the elder age group and the presentation implies that the Lakota cannot deal with the problem themselves; therefore outside help must be brought in to lead the program. This appears to us as a sugar coated attack on sovereignty&quot;.

In 2008, the Red Cloud School at Pine Ridge launched their Lakota language curriculum for K–12 students. In November 2012, the incoming president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, Bryan Brewer, announced that he intended &quot;to lead a Lakota Language Revitalization Initiative that will focus on the creation and operation of Lakota language immersion schools and identifying all fluent Lakota speakers.&quot; A Lakota language immersion daycare center is scheduled to open at Pine Ridge. Also in 2012, Lakota immersion classes were provided for children in an experimental program at Sitting Bull College on the Standing Rock Reservation, where children speak only Lakota for their first year. Tom Red Bird is a Lakota teacher at the program who grew up on the Cheyenne River Reservation. He believes in the importance of teaching the language to younger generations as this would close the gap in the ages of speakers. In 2014, it is estimated that about five percent of children age four to six on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation speak Lakota. Language Revitalization efforts continued to be strengthened by the establishment of several independent, grassroots Lakota language immersion schools and camps, such as those at the Dakota Access Pipeline protests camps at Standing Rock in 2016.

On May 3, 2022, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Council passed Resolution Number 150-22, which, along with banishing the LLC, contains provisions to protect the Nation&#x27;s intellectual property rights and data sovereignty. 

=== Lakota Language Education Program (LLEAP) ===
In 2011, Sitting Bull College (Fort Yates, North Dakota, Standing Rock) and the University of South Dakota began degree programs to create effective Lakota language teachers. By earning a Bachelor of Arts in education at the University of South Dakota or a Bachelor of Science in education at Sitting Bull College, students can major in &quot;Lakota Language Teaching and Learning&quot; as part of the Lakota Language Education Action Program, or LLEAP.

LLEAP is a four-year program designed to create at least 30 new Lakota language teachers by 2014, and was funded by $2.4 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Education. At the end of the initial phase, SBC and USD will permanently offer the Lakota Language Teaching and Learning degree as part of their regular undergraduate Education curriculum. The current LLEAP students&#x27; tuition and expenses are covered by the grant from the U.S. Department of Education. LLEAP is the first program of its kind, offering courses to create effective teachers in order to save a Native American language from going extinct, and potentially educate the 120,000 prospective Lakota speakers in the 21st century.

===Government support===
In 1990, Senator Daniel Inouye (D-HI) sponsored the Native American Languages Act in order to preserve, protect, and promote the rights and freedoms of Native people in America to practice, develop and conduct business in their native language. This law, which took effect on October 30, 1990, reversed over 200 years of American policy that would have otherwise eliminated the indigenous languages of the United States. This legislation gave support to tribal efforts to fund language education programs.

==Lakota influences in English==

Just as people from different regions of countries have accents, Lakota who speak English have some distinct speech patterns. These patterns are displayed in their grammatical sequences and can be heard through some phonological differences. These unique characteristics are also observed in Lakota youth, even those who only learned English.

<text>The Kasai River (, ; called Cassai in Angola) is a left bank tributary of the Congo River, located in Central Africa. The river begins in central Angola and flows to the east until it reaches the border between Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it turns north and serves as the border until it flows into the DRC. From Ilebo, between the confluences with Lulua river and Sankuru river, the Kasai river turns to a westerly direction. The lower stretch of the river, from the confluence with Fimi river until it joins the Congo at Kwamouth northeast of Kinshasa, is also known as the Kwa(h) River. 

The Kasai basin consists mainly of equatorial rainforest areas, which provide an agricultural land in a region noted for its infertile, sandy soil. It is a tributary of Congo river and diamonds are found in it. Around 60% of diamonds in Belgium go from Kasai river for cutting and shaping.

==Exploration==
Henry Morton Stanley reached the confluence on 9 March 1877, calling the river Nkutu, a &quot;powerful and deep river&quot;, but recognizing it as originating from David Livingstone&#x27;s Kwango.

==Tributaries==
The Kasai&#x27;s main tributaries upstream from the confluence with the Congo:
* Fimi (Fimi-Lukenie length 1100 km, basin size 132 000 km2, mean annual discharge ~ 2000 m3/s)
* Kwilu/Kwango (1800 km, 263 500 km2, 3299 m3/s)
* Loange
* Sankuru (1200 km, 156 000 km2, 2500 m3/s) 
* Lulua

==Economic importance==
The tributaries of River Kasai are clear of obstacles like cataracts and river weed, making them very navigable. They facilitate the transport sector and form an important trade artery. The river&#x27;s role in transport and trade was more prominent during the pre-colonial period when the slave trade was legal. Slave traders used one of its major tributaries, the Kwango River, to navigate the equatorial rain forest, capture slaves and find their way back to the Atlantic Ocean where they had docked their ships.
It is greatly controversial that some of the local kingdoms that were along the Kasai River supported the slave trade. The Rund kingdom for instance, readily provided slaves for the most notorious slave traders like John Matthews, a renowned British slave vendor. These activities, though they occurred between the 18th and 19th centuries, left a lasting impact in the regions where they were most prominent, such as between the Kwango and the Kwilu rivers. The population has never recovered fully, with the population density lower than that of areas that did not experience the slave trade.
The most probable trigger to British and Portuguese great interests in the Kasai River was the presence of alluvial diamonds lying in rich deposit beds, especially at the river&#x27;s mouth. More deposits lie along the beds of a major tributary, the Kwango River. In fact, it is common to hear the phrase “the diamond heartland of North Eastern Angola” used in reference to the Kwango River valley. This is because the diamond alluvial beds found in this region are the richest in Angola.

<doc id="513257" wikidata="Q214649" url="?curid=513257" title="Tape measure">
<text>A tape measure or measuring tape is a long, flexible ruler used to measure length or distance. It usually consists of a ribbon of cloth, plastic, fibreglass, or metal strip with linear measurement markings.

== Types==
Tape measures are often designed for specific uses or trades. Tapes may have different scales, be made of different materials, and be of different lengths depending on the intended use.

Tape measures used in tailoring are called &quot;sewing tape&quot;. Originally made from flexible cloth or plastic, fiberglass is now the preferred material due to its resistance from stretching or tearing. Sewing tape is mainly used for the measuring of the subject&#x27;s waist line.Measuring tapes designed for carpentry or construction often use a curved metallic ribbon that can remain stiff and straight when extended, but can also retract into a coil for convenient storage. This type of tape measure will have a hook on the end to aid measuring. The hook is connected to the tape with loose rivets through oval holes, and can move a distance equal to its thickness, to provide both inside and outside measurements that are accurate. Self-marking tape measures allows the user have a graphite tip, allowing for accurate markings.

Surveying requires the measuring of large distances and require an increased need for accuracy. Due to this, measuring tapes used for surveying may be made out of invar because of its low rate of thermal expansion.

=== Cased measuring tape ===
There are two basic types of cased measuring tapes: spring return tape measures and manual return tape measures. While spring return tape measures are compact and self-retracting, manual return measures are designed for longer distances and often require manual winding, often via hand crank.

== History==

Prior to the advent of standardized measuring tapes, tailors employed cloth tapes without any markings. These tapes were manually inscribed with notches to denote specific measurements, enabling tailors to record the proportions of their clients.

James Chesterman, a British metalworker, is credited with the invention of the first retractable tape measure in 1821. His design consisted of a spring-loaded cloth strip with marked measurements, housed within a compact case. Building upon his prior design, Chesterman would patent the first steel tape measure. By capitalizing on the declining popularity of crinoline dresses, Chesterman repurposed the surplus flat wire used in the dresses to create the flexible measuring tape.

On 6 December 1864, William H. Bangs received a patent for the first design of a spring return tape measure. Bang&#x27;s design would later be improved upon by Alvin J. Fellows on July 14, 1868. Fellows&#x27; design differed from Bang&#x27;s by allowing the tape to be held in place via a spring-click mechanism.

The first patented long tape measure in the United States was granted on 10 July 1860 to William H. Paine, and produced by George M. Eddy and Company. This design lacked any measurement points on it. Instead, it functioned as a singular unit of measurement, with the entire length of the tape representing a fixed distance. A brass piece, attached at the end of the tape, served as a reference marker. The length corresponding to the tape&#x27;s full extension was then indicated on the case or crank mechanism.

In 1871, Justus Roe introduced a cost cutting technique to the tape measure. Employing rivets to attach small brass washers to the tape, he could mark inches and feet. To further enhance readability, small brass tags were affixed at five-foot intervals, each bearing a number indicating the total number of feet to that point. While this technique was not patented, Justus Roe and Sons popularized this design in their &quot;Roe Electric Reel Tape Measures&quot; during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. To compete with other products, they transitioned to etching or stamping increments and numbers directly onto the tape, eliminating the need for rivets and washers. It is important to note that the &quot;electric&quot; moniker was merely a marketing term and did not signify any electrical functionality.

On 3 January 1922, Hiram A. Farrand patented his concave-convex tape. The concave nature of his design allowed the tape to stay rigid, even when extended. Their product was later sold to Stanley Black &amp; Decker.
In 1947, the Swedish engineer Ture Anders Ljungberg began developing an improved version and in 1954 the &quot;TALmeter&quot; was introduced. It features edges at both the end of the tape and the mouth to cut marks so measures (including arcs) can be transferred without reading the scale, as well as a fold-out metal tongue at the rear, also with an edge, to be used when taking internal measures. The tape has three scales: the normal metric, the internal scale and a diameter scale used for instance to measure sheet metal to be rolled into a cylinder of a certain diameter. It was produced by his own company T A Ljungberg AB until 2005, when it was bought by Hultafors in 2005, who retained the name &quot;Talmeter&quot; for the product they now refer to as a &quot;märkmeter&quot; (marker-meter).

In March 1963, Stanley Tools introduced the PowerLock tape measure series. It was the first to use a molded ABS case, thumb actuated tape lock, and riveted end hook. By 1989, Stanley was producing more than 200,000 tape measures every day.

The first commercialized Digital Tape Measure was released by Starrett in 1995 under the DigiTape brand.

==Design==
The basic design on which all modern spring tape measures are built can trace its origins back to an 1864 patent by a Meriden, Connecticut resident named William H. Bangs Jr. According to the text of his patent, Bang&#x27;s tape measure was an improvement on other versions previously designed.

The spring tape measure has existed in the U.S. since Bang&#x27;s patent in 1864, but its usage did not become very popular due to the difficulty in communication from one town to another and the expense of the tape measure. In the late 1920s, carpenters began slowly adopting H. A. Farrand&#x27;s design as the one more commonly used. Farrand&#x27;s new design was a concave/convex tape made of metal which would stand straight out a distance of four to six feet. This design is the basis for most modern pocket tape measures used today.

With the mass production of the integrated circuit (IC) the tape measure has also entered into the digital age with the digital tape measure. Some incorporate a digital screen to give measurement readouts in multiple formats. An early patent for this type of measure was published in 1977.

There are also other styles of tape measures that have incorporated lasers and ultrasonic technology to measure the distance of an object with fairly reliable accuracy.

Tape measures often have black and red measurements on a yellow background as this is the optimal color combination for readability.

===United States===
Most tapes sold in the United States are inches- and feet-based. Some tapes have additional marks in the shape of small black diamonds, appearing every , used to mark out equal spacing for joists (five joists or trusses per US standard length of building material). 
Many US tapes also have special markings every , which is a US standard interval for studs in construction: three spaces of 16 inches make exactly which is the US commercial width of a sheet of plywood, gyproc or particle board.
The sale of dual Metric/US Customary scale measuring tapes is slowly becoming common in the United States. For example, in some Walmarts there are Hyper Tough brand tapes available in both US customary units and Metric units. Unlike US rulers, of which an overwhelming majority contain both centimeter and inch scales, tape measures are longer and thus traditionally have had scales in both inches and feet &amp; inches. So, the inclusion of a metric scale requires the measuring device either to contain 3 scales of measurement or the elimination of one of the US Customary scales.

The use of millimeter only tape measures for housing construction is a part of the US metric building code. This code does not permit the use of centimeters. Millimeters produce whole (integer) numbers, reduce arithmetic errors, thus decreasing wastage due to such errors. The US made measuring tape shown on the right is interesting in that it is a &quot;Reverse Measuring Tape&quot;, where the measurements can be read from right to left just as well as they can be read when the tape is used from left to right.

As a curious fact, in 1956, Justus Roe, a surveyor and tape-maker by trade, made the gold-plated tape measure and, in a publicity gimmick, presented it to American professional baseball player Mickey Mantle.

=== Australia ===
The building industry was the first major industry grouping in Australia to complete its change to metric, being completed by January 1976.

In this, the industry was grateful to the SAA (now Standards Australia) for the early production of the Standard AS 1155-1974 &quot;Metric Units for Use in the Construction Industry&quot;, which specified the use of millimetres as the small unit for the metrication upgrade. In the adoption of the millimetre as the &quot;small&quot; unit of length for metrication (instead of the centimetre), the Metric Conversion Board leaned heavily on experience in the UK and within the ISO, where this decision had already been taken.

This was formally stated as follows:
&quot;The metric units for linear measurement in building and construction will be the metre (m) and the millimetre (mm), with the kilometre (km) being used where required. This will apply to all sectors of the industry, and the centimetre (cm) shall not be used. … the centimetre should not be used in any calculation and it should never be written down&quot;.

The logic of using the millimetre in this context was that the metric system had been so designed that there would exist a multiple or submultiple for every use. Decimal fractions would not have to be used. Since the tolerances on building components and building practice would rarely be less than one millimetre, the millimetre became the sub-unit most appropriate to this industry.

Because of this, those in the building/construction industry mainly use millimetre only tapes. While dual scale tapes showing both inches and centimetres are sold, these are mainly imported low-cost items, since it would be a restraint of trade to not allow their importation.

===United Kingdom===
Tape measures sold in the UK often have dual scales for metric and imperial units. Like the American tape measures described above, they also have markings every and .

=== Canada ===
Tape measures sold in Canada often have dual scales for metric and imperial units. All tapes in imperial units have markings every , but not at every .
Home construction in Canada is largely, if not entirely, in imperial measure.

== Accuracy and standardisation ==

The accuracy of a tape measure is dependent on the ends of the tape and the markings printed onto the tape. The accuracy for the end of a retractable tape measure is dependent on the hook&#x27;s sliding mechanism and thickness.

The European Commission (EC) has standardised a non-compulsory classification system for certifying tape measure accuracy, with certified tapes falling into one of three classes of accuracy: Classes I, II, and III. For example, under specific conditions the tolerances for 10m long tapes are:

* Class I: accurate to ±1.10mm over 10m length
* Class II: accurate to ±2.30mm over 10m length
* Class III: accurate to ±4.60mm over 10m length

If a tape measure has been certified then the class rating is printed onto the tape alongside other symbols including the nominal length of the tape, the year of manufacture, the country of manufacture, and the name of the manufacturer. For retractable tapes, Class I are the most accurate and tend to be the most expensive, while Class II tapes are the most common class available.

<text>The Canada Line is a rapid transit line in Greater Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, that is part of the SkyTrain system. The line is owned by TransLink and InTransitBC and is operated by ProTrans BC. Coloured turquoise on route maps, it operates as an airport rail link between Vancouver, Richmond, and the Vancouver International Airport (YVR). The line comprises 16 stations and of track; the main line runs from Vancouver to Richmond while a spur line from Bridgeport station connects to the airport. It opened on August 17, 2009, ahead of the 2010 Winter Olympics.

The Canada Line was anticipated to have 100,000 boardings per day in 2013 and 142,000 boardings per day by 2021, but it has consistently exceeded early targets. Ridership has grown steadily since opening day, with average ridership of 83,000 per day in September 2009, 105,000 per day in March 2010, and over 136,000 passengers per weekday in June 2011. During the 17 days of the 2010 Winter Olympics, the line carried an average of 228,190 passengers per day.

Governance of the project was through Canada Line Rapid Transit Inc. (CLCO), formerly RAV Project Management Ltd. (RAVCO), a reflection of the original &quot;Richmond–Airport–Vancouver&quot; name). The line was built by SNC-Lavalin, and InTransitBC is under contract with TransLink to manage the line for its first 35 years, until 2044. The Canada Line is operationally independent from British Columbia Rapid Transit Company, which operates SkyTrain&#x27;s Expo and Millennium lines but is considered a part of the SkyTrain network. Like the other two SkyTrain lines in Metro Vancouver, it is also light metro rapid transit, using fully automated trains on grade-separated guideways. However, the trains are powered by conventional motors with third rail electrical pickup rather than the linear induction system used on the other SkyTrain lines.

== Route ==

The Canada Line begins in Downtown Vancouver at Waterfront station () in a cut-and-cover subway tunnel beneath Granville Street. It quickly goes into twin-bored tunnels, heading southwest beneath Granville Street, then curving southeast to follow Davie Street through Yaletown. The tunnels then dive deeper to pass below False Creek before rising back up to Olympic Village station (). There, the line transitions back to a cut-and-cover tunnel (which is noted by the tunnel changing from a circular to a square shape), heading south under Cambie Street. This section has some portions where the two sets of tracks are stacked vertically. The line emerges from the ground just south of 64th Avenue, climbing to an elevated guideway.

The line continues elevated across the North Arm Bridge over the North Arm of the Fraser River, leaving Vancouver and entering Richmond. Just beyond Bridgeport station () at a flying junction, the line splits, with the Richmond branch heading south on elevated tracks along No. 3 Road and terminating at Richmond–Brighouse station (). The airport branch turns west and crosses the Middle Arm Bridge over the Middle Arm of the Fraser River, connecting to stations on Sea Island and terminating at YVR–Airport station (). Portions of the airport branch are at grade in order to accommodate a future elevated taxiway for aircraft over the line. Both branches narrow to a single track as they approach their respective terminus stations. Just before Bridgeport station is the Operations and Maintenance Centre (OMC) facility, which houses Canada Line trains that are not in use.

== Stations ==

Station construction was designed as a two-stage process. Sixteen original stations opened at the same time as the line did. Three additional stations are planned, and may be built in the future. The stations are listed below.

Each Canada Line station is slightly different in appearance, designed to blend in with the surrounding neighbourhood. For example, Langara–49th Avenue station is designed to fit into the area&#x27;s low-density residential neighbourhood.

The five busiest stations have platforms long, while the rest of the stations have platforms that can be easily extended to 50 metres. The termini at YVR–Airport and Richmond–Brighouse stations are single-tracked, whereas the Waterfront station terminus is double-tracked. The double-tracking is necessary to accommodate the three-minute headways between trains on the Waterfront–Bridgeport portion of the line. King Edward station is the only station with a stacked configuration, and Broadway–City Hall station is the only station with a double-height ceiling over the platforms. Vancouver City Centre station is linked to Pacific Centre mall and Vancouver Centre Mall, in addition to having street level access. All direct transfers to the Expo and Millennium Lines must be made at Waterfront station; there is no direct connection from Vancouver City Centre station to Granville station. However, it is possible to transfer between those two stations via a short walk through Pacific Centre or Vancouver Centre Mall.

Stations were configured to allow for the future installation of fare gates, and received fare gates in 2013 as part of full implementation throughout all SkyTrain stations. Every station has an up escalator and an elevator, but only the three terminal stations have down escalators.

Until late 2019, six stations (Vancouver City Centre, Olympic Village, Broadway–City Hall, Marine Drive, Templeton, and YVR–Airport) were equipped with self-service flight check-in kiosks which allowed customers to check into their flights at Vancouver International Airport while at these stations.

=== Additional stations ===

Provisions have been made to allow for the addition of the following infill stations in the future:

* 33rd Avenue (Cambie Street at West 33rd Avenue, next to Queen Elizabeth Park)
* 57th Avenue (Cambie Street at West 57th Avenue)
*: The future of a 57th Avenue (Cambie Street and West 57th Avenue) in Vancouver is not fully known at this time. The original plan was that one day a station could be built, but new documents and talk between TransLink and the City of Vancouver raise the possibility of it never happening. The station was part of the broad policy statement adopted in 2014 by city council for the redevelopment of the Pearson Dogwood lands. But in June 2017 Susan Haid, city assistant director of planning for Vancouver South, submitted a report to Vancouver council stating that &quot;though it is desirable to achieve a future station at 57th Avenue there are a number of key challenges,&quot; Haid wrote in her report. &quot;Currently, the station is not considered in regional transportation plans and is not considered a regional priority such as the Broadway Corridor line.&quot; Haid also added to her report that, &quot;Should the station not be attainable in the long-term future, the financial contribution towards a future station would be re-allocated to address the amenity priorities identified for Pearson Dogwood and those in and around the Cambie Corridor consistent with the respective public benefit strategies.&quot;
* YVR Terminal 3 (near YVR Terminal 3) 
*: The master plan for the Vancouver International Airport for 2027 indicates that this station would be built alongside the airport&#x27;s proposed Northeast Terminal expansion.

== Transit connections ==

Many transit services connect with the Canada Line and form an important part of the service. With the opening of the line, most bus routes in Richmond, and connecting services from White Rock, Tsawwassen, and Ladner, doubled their service frequency. Waterfront station provides connections to the R5 Hastings St, Expo Line, West Coast Express, and SeaBus. Broadway–City Hall provides a connection to the 99 B-Line service.

There are currently only two routes serving Vancouver International Airport: the N10 NightBus, running parallel to the Canada Line along Granville Street, and route 412, running between Airport South and Bridgeport station. Riders on these bus routes are not subject to the YVR AddFare. The Airport Station exchange was downgraded to a regular bus stop on September 7, 2009, a few weeks after the opening of the line. Bus routes that used this loop were discontinued (as in the case of the 424 and the 98 B-Line), short-turned (as in the case of the 100, renamed 100 Marpole Loop), or redirected to Bridgeport station (as in the case of the 620, C90, and C92).

Work began in May 2021 to extend the Millennium Line from VCC–Clark station west along Broadway to the new Arbutus station, allowing for a transfer to the Canada Line at Broadway–City Hall station. As indicated in material presented by the City of Vancouver at public meetings in early 2006, this station was designed with such a future extension in mind. A &quot;knock-out&quot; panel was installed in the concourse that would facilitate construction of a connection between the station and a Broadway-corridor SkyTrain extension.

The Canada Line uses the same fare system as the rest of the transit system managed by TransLink, with two exceptions:

* The YVR AddFare, started in January 2010, is a surcharge that applies to some passengers leaving the airport and travelling eastbound to Bridgeport station and beyond. Passengers headed away from the airport must pay a $5 AddFare on top of the regular fare to leave the Sea Island stations unless they are travelling on a monthly pass; or a DayPass or a single-use Compass Ticket not that was not purchased on Sea Island.
* Travel between the Sea Island stations is free to everyone. There is no additional fare for passengers travelling toward the airport. Such trips require a special Sea Island ticket that is free to obtain at any ticket machine at the Sea Island stations. These tickets are not valid for tapping out at other stations; an exit ticket is required for Sea Island ticketholders exiting at any station outside of Sea Island.

The Canada Line operates on a &quot;Fare Paid Zone&quot; system. Passengers are required by law to possess a valid fare when they are in Fare Paid Zones. Fare Paid Zones are clearly marked, and fares can be bought from Compass Vending Machines at all stations. Fare inspections are mostly conducted by the South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service. Passengers who fail to pay the fare or do not have a valid fare may be fined $173 and/or removed from the station or train.

Canada Line attendants are the customer service staff for the Canada Line. They are easily identifiable by their green uniforms. They provide customer service, troubleshoot certain problems with the trains, observe and report safety issues, and check fares.
== Technology ==
The Canada Line uses a fleet of trains built by Rotem, a division of Hyundai Motor Group. The trains are powered by conventional electric motors, rather than the linear induction motors used by the Expo and Millennium Line&#x27;s Bombardier ART trains. Canada Line trains are operated by the same SelTrac automated train control system used in the rest of the SkyTrain network.

The selection of Rotem was largely a consequence of the request for proposals process for the public-private partnership, whose terms did not allow Bombardier to consider efficiencies in combining operations or rolling-stock orders for the new line with those for the existing system. This placed all bidders on a level playing field, albeit at the cost of not necessarily picking the most efficient choice for long-term operation. The RFP also required that the system have a capacity of 15,000 passengers per hour in each direction (leaving the choice of technology and platform length to the proponent) and a maximum travel time between the airport and downtown Vancouver of 24 minutes.

The fleet consists of 32 fully automated two-car articulated trains, for a total of 64 cars. The capacity of the trains is estimated at 334 people per pair of cars (comfortably) or 400 people at crush load. The trains have a top speed of in normal operation and in catch-up mode. Each married pair of gangway-connected cars is long and wide, and longer and wider than the Bombardier ART fleet used on the Expo and Millennium lines. Each train has LED electronic displays on the exterior to indicate the terminus station and on the interior to display the next station and the terminus station, a useful feature considering the line has two branches.

In 2018, twelve additional trainsets were ordered by Translink from Hyundai Rotem at a cost of $88 million to increase capacity on the line. The sole-source contract allowed for commonality between the two train models, and reduced the number of specialized tools and parts required. These were delivered in 2019 and 2020.

== Name ==

During the planning and public consultation stages, the line was known as the &quot;Richmond-Airport-Vancouver Line&quot;, or RAV for short. The name &quot;Canada Line&quot; was adopted in 2005 to coincide with the beginning of construction. Some early documents also refer to it as the &quot;Olympic Line&quot;, in recognition of the 2010 Winter Olympics, continuing the practice by which the Expo and Millennium lines were named after significant events occurring at the time of construction. This name was adopted for the demonstration modern streetcar service that operated along the Downtown Historic Railway for a two-month period centred on the Olympics.

== Timeline ==

* Between 1990 and 1992, BC Transit and N. D. Lea (now WSP Global) consultants studied intermediate-capacity transit system options in the Vancouver–Richmond corridor.
* From September 1991 through August 1993, the TRANSPORT 2021 Steering Committee carried out an extensive program of research and public consultation to create &quot;A Long Range Transportation Plan for Greater Vancouver&quot;. Under Project Director M. L. (Martin Crilly), a comprehensive transportation investment and financing strategy was envisioned for the region. Until today all existing and proposed road and transit investments have been put forth in this plan. The plan calls for the provision of an intermediate-capacity transit system from Richmond to Vancouver&#x27;s central business district.
* In fall of 1994, N. D. Lea and Delcan consultants carried out studies examining technologies, operating feasibility, ridership, capital and operating costs, traffic impacts, and development potential in three corridors, including the Richmond–Vancouver corridor. These studies were prepared as input into BC Transit&#x27;s 10-Year Development Plan. They did not include a spur line to the Vancouver International Airport.
* In 1995, BC Transit (a crown corporation responsible for public transit) expressed a desire to create a special bus rapid transit (BRT) or automated rapid transit (ART) service connecting the cities of Richmond and Vancouver and the Vancouver International Airport in one of the transit improvement plans.
** Underground rights-of-way were reserved at the Concord Pacific development close to the Cambie bridge.
* From mid-1997 to mid-1998 a number of BRT routes for Vancouver-airport/Richmond were evaluated, and the preferred route and station locations were selected.
* June 24, 1998, the minister in charge of BC Transit, Joy MacPhail, announced plans to build a Vancouver–Richmond ALRT: &quot;The new line would link Richmond city centre, the airport and Downtown Vancouver—probably running north-south through Vancouver along the Cambie Street corridor.&quot; &quot;MacPhail said the province wants to accelerate the construction of rapid transit to Richmond as part of a bid to bring the 2010 Winter Olympics to the Lower Mainland.&quot;
* In 1999, detailed design of the Vancouver-Airport/Richmond BRT was carried out.
* On April 1, 1999, The Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority (TransLink) was created under the direction of CEO Ken Dobell, previously city manager for the City of Vancouver.
* In April 2000, TransLink adopted its Strategic Transportation Plan 2000–2005. The plan noted that future transit lines have equal priority, and recommended the planning and design of a Richmond-Airport-Vancouver (RAV) rapid transit line.
* May 2000 saw the approval of the RAV study, while construction had begun on the BRT service between Richmond Centre, Airport Station exchange, and downtown Vancouver.
* In 2000, a Transport Canada report on rail access to the airport estimated it would cost $1.3billion for a SkyTrain expansion using the Cambie route and $738million for a light rail system along the Arbutus corridor.
* In December 2000, TransLink received the report on public-private partnerships for road and transportation infrastructure, the model that would be used to finance, construct, and operate the new Canada Line.
* On April 1, 2001, bus operators and other CMBC employees went on strike, delaying full implementation of the Vancouver-Airport-Richmond BRT by four months.
* That same month, TransLink reaffirmed a Vancouver–Richmond line including a connection to the airport, and approved a recommendation by the TransLink CEO that, based on greater benefits from a private-sector perspective and community concerns, at-grade rail transit be excluded from further analysis and that analysis in Vancouver be restricted to underground options.
* On August 1, 2001, the 98 B-Line BRT service began service in the corridor, ultimately carrying over 20,000 passengers per day, while plans were already under way for an ART service to replace it. This proposed service was projected to carry over 100,000 passengers per day.
* On December 10, 2001, the federal government under Jean Chrétien announced over $2.0billion in funding for large infrastructure projects; the Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund established by this budget would fund the federal government&#x27;s contribution to the Canada Line. The government stipulated that the fund promote private-public partnerships where appropriate.
* In April 2002, work was started on the third phase, project definition. This ten-month task consisted of a technical evaluation to determine if it was possible to build the line by 2010.
* In 2003, ten companies or consortia submitted expressions of interest in the project.
* In December 2003, this was shortlisted to the following three consortia, which were given a request for proposal:
** RAVLink Transportation, which included Fluor Canada, Siemens AG Canada, MTR Corporation, and Balfour Beatty Capital Projects;
** RAVxpress, which included Bombardier, AMEC, Bouygues Travaux Publics, and Bilfinger Berger; and
** SNC-Lavalin/Serco, which included SNC-Lavalin and Serco.
* On April 16, 2004, the federal government under Prime Minister Paul Martin increased its funding promise from $300 million to $450 million.
* On June 10, 2004, the provincial government restated its commitment to the Canada Line, increasing funding from $300 to $370 million, and earmarked $170 million for the Evergreen Line.
* On June 30, 2004, after twice voting to cancel the project, the TransLink Board approved the RAV line but maintained the right to cancel the project if none of the bids met the approved budget of $1.35 billion.
* On November 19, 2004, RAVCO recommended that the SNC-Lavalin/Serco (now known as InTransitBC) proposal for a fully automated, grade-separated system be accepted. This &quot;best and final offer&quot; bid was $343 million over the approved budget. The project was, however, brought within the funding allowance through various cost-trimming measures, including design changes, the contractor agreeing to lower its bid, and the province contributing another $65 million.
* On December 1, 2004, the TransLink board gave final approval for the project.
* On July 29, 2005, the final contract to design, build, and operate the RAV Line was signed by InTransitBC and TransLink. Serco was no longer a partner to InTransitBC, and two pension funds were brought into the partnership.
* In October 2005, the utilities relocation and road work was started.
* On November 25, 2005, the design of the new trains was unveiled, and Hyundai Rotem was announced as the supplier of the trains. It was announced that the new line would be called the Canada Line as a funding condition from the federal government.
* The line opened at 1 p.m. local time on August 17, 2009, on budget and three and a half months ahead of schedule, and six months ahead of the 2010 Winter Olympics held in Vancouver. It began normal revenue service on the following day.
* On September 30, 2009, it was announced that the Canada Line had seen an average of 82,500 passengers per day since opening, putting it well on track to reach its ridership target of 100,000 per day within two years.
* On December 28, 2009, it was revealed that the average daily ridership (including weekends) has grown to 93,000 and has occasionally exceeded 100,000, three years ahead of expectations.
* On February 5, 2010, ridership reached a (then) record of 135,000 during a campaign to encourage residents to use transit prior to the Olympics. Further single-day records included 157,000 on February 11, 2010, and 210,000 on February 15, 2010, with all 20 trains running.
* Overall, the 2010 Winter Olympics saw the Canada Line&#x27;s ridership increase by 118 percent to an average of 228,190 per day for 17 days, with a single-day record of 287,400 on February 19, 2010. Its regular non-Olympic ridership was stated as being 104,674 per weekday.
* In February 2011, Translink revealed that the average daily ridership of the Canada Line had grown to 110,000 per day.
* In September 2021, construction began on Capstan station at Capstan Way; the station opened in December 2024.

== Project funding ==

The Canada Line was built as a public-private partnership. Funding was provided by both government agencies and a private partner, the proponent. As of March 2009, the entire project was expected to cost $2.054 billion. The premier of BC stated that the project was on budget and ahead of schedule. When approved in December 2004, the cost was given as $1.76 billion.

The public contributions to the budget come from the following sources:

* Government of Canada: $450 million
* Government of British Columbia: $435 million
* Vancouver Airport Authority: $300million
* TransLink: $334 million
* City of Vancouver: $29 million

These sums are all in 2006 dollars, except for the government of Canada&#x27;s contribution, which will be paid out when constructed, and is estimated to be equivalent of $419 million 2003 dollars.

The private partner was expected to contribute $200 million, and be responsible for any construction cost overruns. As of November 7, 2009, InTransitBC has invested $750 million. InTransitBC is a joint venture company owned by SNC-Lavalin, the Investment Management Corporation of BC (), and the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.

The BC government had committed $370 million, but when the bid came in over budget, it contributed an extra $65 million. TransLink also put in extra money by committing money from the sale of the Sexsmith Park and Ride in Richmond and from the introduction of a special fare in the Airport Zone.

In November 2004, bid costs were reduced by postponing the construction of a walkway between Waterfront station and the cruise ship terminal, removing Westminster station, and moving Richmond Centre station and the end of the line several hundred metres north. TransLink would further pay for the cost of reinstallation of the trolley wires along Cambie. As a way to further reduce the best and final offer, RAVCO no longer required that the proponent provide for 59 ticket vending machines and 38 ticket validating machines or for a police unit to operate on the RAV line. RAVCO also shifted responsibility for moving trolley wires from SNC-Lavalin to TransLink. Costs were also decreased due to decisions to single-track sections on the Richmond and airport branches. The Richmond branch was single-tracked from Ackroyd Road onward in large part due to Richmond&#x27;s city council pressuring for the visual profile of the overhead line to be reduced for esthetic reasons.

On July 11, 2006, a decision was made to relocate Broadway station half a block north at a cost of $3million to allow for better integration of the station with Broadway and a new development in the area. The funding was provided as follows: one third from the City of Vancouver, one third from TransLink, and one third from surplus funding available to CLCO.

In February 2007, TransLink approved the addition of a pedestrian and bicycle path to the Canada Line Bridge and agreed not to postpone the construction of a station at 2nd Avenue (Olympic Village station), but instead build it to be ready when the line opens. The $10million cost of the bridge bike path was paid for by TransLink and not considered part of the cost of the Canada Line. The Olympic Village station cost an additional $29million.

RAVCO was set up by the agencies funding the transit line to oversee project design, procurement, construction, and implementation. This TransLink subsidiary, later renamed Canada Line Rapid Transit Inc (CLCO), made distributions to the builder as work progressed.

The table below lists the year-by-year contributions (in millions of dollars) made by various governments on a year-by-year basis up to December 31, 2008. Contributions by TransLink are total disbursements minus contributions from the City of Vancouver, the government of British Columbia, and the government of Canada. Calculations show that TransLink has contributed $271million to date. It has committed an additional $52million in its 2009 budget.

The private sector will operate the line for 35 years in return for a share of its operating revenue.

In early 2006, TransLink decided not to install turnstiles at Canada Line stations, but stations would be designed to accommodate controlled access to allow TransLink to install them for less cost if it wished to do so in the future. On April 9, 2009, TransLink, the provincial government, and the government of Canada announced joint funding of $100 million to introduce turnstiles at all 49 SkyTrain stations. While a large portion of this funding will be used on the Expo and Millennium Lines, a portion will be used on the Canada Line stations. The federal government is contributing $30 million and the province is adding $40 million toward fare gates, or controlled access gates.

== Construction ==

Construction began in October 2005 and was completed in August 2009.

At initial completion, the line comprised the following construction elements:

In addition to the of track above, there are about of track in the OMC.

== Controversies ==

Opponents have claimed that the approval process was undemocratic and dishonest. In 2004, critics said that the projected ridership figures were grossly inflated; ridership projections were exceeded in 2010 and subsequent years. Opponents also argued that the official claim that the project had nothing to do with Vancouver&#x27;s bid to host the 2010 Winter Olympics was not credible.

=== Public-private partnerships ===

Opponents of the RAV line&#x27;s public-private partnership (P3) believe it was politically motivated and that it will cost more money because of the private involvement. However, the private involvement allowed for construction costs to be known and fixed up front. After raising its contribution to $435 million, the BC minister of transport and premier reaffirmed that this was the final contribution and that any cost overruns would be the responsibility of the proponent. The Canadian Union of Public Employees opposed the use of a P3 to design, build, and operate the Canada Line. The P3 process did not allow precise plans to be developed with public consultation, but limited discussion to certain abstract parameters, while leaving actual design details to the private partner.

=== Ridership projections ===

Before the building of the line, TransLink had projected that it would require a 100,000 passenger/day average to reach the &quot;break even point&quot;. They also projected that it would take about three years for capacity to reach this point and that TransLink would be responsible for the loss. However, the Canada Line reached its projected ridership goal in late 2010, three years early. In 2017, TransLink CEO Kevin Desmond suggested that the Canada Line was underbuilt for its ridership, especially because more people moved into transit-oriented developments along the line following its completion. In 2019, former Vancouver city councillor Gord Price noted that the desire to have the line open in time for the 2010 Winter Olympics, as well as not exceeding the budget, led to cautious decision making. In 2018, 12 additional trainsets were purchased to increase capacity on the line by 35 percent.

=== Alignment and grade separation ===

==== Vancouver ====

Although the latest proposal for rapid transit did not include an option for rapid transit down the Arbutus corridor along the abandoned CPR right of way, Vancouver council reopened debate on this issue. Given that the rail right of way is currently zoned for transit use with space available for transit lines, running the line down the Arbutus corridor may have been more cost-effective than tunnelling under Cambie. The planners and RAVCO, however, countered that the Arbutus corridor does not have the major concentration of transit destinations and origins that exist along the Cambie Street corridor, such as Vancouver City Hall, Vancouver General Hospital, Oakridge Centre, and Langara College, which are necessary to provide the ridership required for this project to be successful. Also the Arbutus corridor is longer than the Cambie corridor and would cause longer travel times. The Cambie corridor further had greater potential for future ridership growth.

The Project Definition Report further specified that any service had to be able to travel from Waterfront station in downtown Vancouver to the airport in 25 minutes or less. At-grade transit, either along Cambie or the Arbutus corridor, was ruled out as a result. The reason or origin for this exact requirement was not specified, although travel times were considered an important factor in attracting new riders and in retaining existing riders, who were now required to make an extra transfer relative to the existing bus service.

All partner contributions were made upon the specifications set in the Project Definition Report. Any &quot;significant change&quot; would allow each partner to reconsider its respective contribution. As the Arbutus corridor proposal could not meet the specifications, this could put participation of funding partners in jeopardy.

Residents along Cambie Boulevard created the Cambie Boulevard Heritage Society in 1994, which opposed any alteration to a wide green centre median that is currently a grassy area with various species of trees, including cherry trees donated by the City of Yokohama on occasion of the 1967 Canadian Centennial. The residents had already been mobilized in 1989 in response to the possibility of elevated rail along Cambie Boulevard. In effect the residents were opposed to surface, trench, or elevated rail along much of Cambie Street. Even cut-and-cover construction raised concerns over construction impacts and temporary traffic diversions. Cost and ridership risks were also concerns to property tax–paying residents. Advertisements asked residents to join &quot;to prevent Vancouver&#x27;s worst traffic nightmare and from burdening ourselves and our children with unnecessary tax risks for years to come&quot;. The society suggested that the line instead be constructed along Arbutus, where its impact and cost would be minimal. Despite the society&#x27;s concerns, one of the final two proposals for the Canada Line in 2004 involved a trench in the centre of Cambie Street from 49th to 64th Avenues.

On June 18, 2004, the TransLink Board voted 6–6 to oppose sending the project to the &quot;best and final offer&quot; stage. Opponents of the project favoured a proposal to build a line along the Cambie corridor involving a minimal amount of tunnelling, at a saving of about $300 million over the previously fully grade-separated proposal. The province responded to the suggestion by withdrawing funding until after the 2010 Olympics; Minister of Transport Kevin Falcon said that such a change of scope could no longer be accommodated in the time left before 2010. Mayors and councillors sitting on the TransLink Board, however, could not come to an agreement on this alternate plan of action. The impasse created a stir in the business community, which joined together and called for the province to take over control of the project. &quot;The Coalition FOR a Lower Mainland Rapid Transit Solution&quot; in a newspaper ad called on the premier to &quot;please rescue our rapid transit&quot;. The Vancouver Board of Trade, the Council of Tourism Associations, and Tourism Vancouver led the call on the premier. While the board ultimately voted to proceed, the incident had lasting repercussions for TransLink.

==== Richmond ====

When the results of the bidding process indicated that an elevated option in Richmond was the winning bid, Richmond council engaged in some last-minute opposition to the RAV line and refused to give RAVCO the green light.

Objections to the elevated line included its visual impact and the impact and cost of any extensions into Richmond. The line would have varied impact on businesses along No. 3 Road.

In November 2004, a survey of 11,750 people was conducted by RAVCO to determine if people in Richmond supported an elevated or at-grade service in Richmond. Of the respondents, 58 percent favoured an elevated option. 

Even after the survey, however, another option was brought forward. On November 22, 2004, Richmond council considered whether an elevated guideway along No. 3 Road in Richmond was appropriate. If an at-grade service was not feasible, council had instructed staff to look into the possibility of relocating the elevated guideway further west, along Minoru Boulevard. In response, residents along Minoru Boulevard presented a petition containing 666 signatures opposing the Minoru alignment. In the petition they &quot;indicated that if Translink and RAVCO were not prepared to construct an at-grade system on No. 3 Road, then the project should be abandoned in favour of bus service on No. 3 Road.&quot;

When further surveys and public consultation conducted by city staff in December indicated that residents did not support the realignment along Minoru Boulevard, council was left to either turn down the development or support the best and final offer. They chose to go ahead with the project. As a final compromise, part of the elevated track in Richmond was single-tracked to reduce visual impact.

=== Impact on local businesses ===

For the entire consultation process, it was assumed that any underground construction along the Cambie corridor would be by bored tunnel. It was only upon the publication of the winning bid that it became apparent that the portion of the line from 64th to 2nd Avenues would be constructed using cut-and-cover construction. This raised concern over the disruption of local business on Cambie Street. Businesses in Yaletown and No. 3 Road in Richmond would also be affected by the construction. Although construction in the downtown was mostly by bored tunnel, businesses in Yaletown were caught off guard when it turned out that Yaletown-Roundhouse station would be north of Pacific Boulevard on Davie Street, rather than south of Pacific Boulevard. InTransitBC responded by launching an advertising campaign promoting local business on the line. Despite these efforts, businesses on Cambie Street experienced significant loss of business. After numerous failed appeals to the provincial government for compensation, store operators unsuccessfully sued for compensation. However, since the completion of the Canada Line, the line has been linked to rising property values along Cambie Street and in Richmond.

=== Impact on expansion of other transit options ===

It had been pointed out that construction of the Canada Line would do little to improve transit or alleviate congestion on the Broadway corridor to UBC, which serves more than 100,000 weekday trips on bus services, with many trips continuing to University of British Columbia. In addition, the Evergreen Extension rapid transit project was delayed (until 2016). As TransLink is solely responsible for funding bus operations, any shortage of funding may translate into cuts in bus service.

=== Hiring practices ===

There were several labour disputes related to wages and unionization between employees and contractors working on the construction of the Canada Line. To excavate the final of the tunnel underneath the downtown core a crew of 36 Latin American workers were brought to Canada from Costa Rica, Ecuador and Colombia in April 2006. The employer, a joint partnership of SELI Canada and SNC (Pacific) engaged workers to assemble the tunnel boring machine (TBM) and begin excavations. Pay stubs and testimony evidence from the workers indicated that they were paid US$1,000 monthly in exchange for 65-hour work weeks (less than $4 per hour). The Latin Americans, all on temporary work permits, joined the Construction and Specialized Workers Unions Local 1611 and, in a majority vote, won union certification on June 23, 2006. This was the first time in Canadian history that a group of temporary foreign workers in the construction industry had successfully exercised their right to form a union. Before the union had a chance to begin collective bargaining, workers&#x27; wages were increased to $14.21 per hour and hours were reduced to 40 hours per week with overtime concessions as required by BC labour law. The union was not consulted, and the unilateral pay raise led to an unfair labour practice complaint from the CSWU 1611. The BC Labour Relations Board (BCLRB) sided with the employer&#x27;s (SELI–SNCP) explanation that there had been a mistake in calculations of wages during the months before the workers voted to join the union. The employer stalled negotiations for a collective agreement until they were ordered back to the bargaining table in August 2006 by the BCLRB.

In September, bargaining broke down. On September 21, 2006, CSWU 1611 workers threatened a strike vote to bring the employer back to the bargaining table.

After almost two years of litigation, the BC Labour Relations Board ruled against the union&#x27;s claims of unfair labour practices.

In a separate complaint, the union claimed discrimination against the workers based on their country of origin. Even with the newly imposed wage of $14.21 per hour, the Latin Americans were earning half the wages of European (Italian, Spanish and Portuguese) workers with whom they worked alongside and performed the same underground TBM operations.

On November 9, 2007, the BC Human Rights Tribunal ruled that the Latin American workers had been intimidated to sign a petition against being represented by their union. The tribunal found that the workers were intimidated and coerced to sign a petition in the fear of possibly losing future job prospects with their employer. The petition would have prevented them from being represented by a union before the tribunal and would also have created evidence that could have jeopardized the ongoing investigation by the tribunal over perceived discrimination.

Upon completion of the tunnels in March 2008, the workers were laid-off and returned to their home countries. Only five of the workers were re-hired by SELI after their arrival back to their home countries.

On December 3, 2008, the BC Human Rights Tribunal found in favour of the discrimination complaint. The decision prohibits employers from discrimination based on a workers&#x27; country of origin. Migrant workers must not suffer wage discrimination based on low wage labour markets in their countries of origin. The Latin Americans workers were awarded the difference in wages with an additional $10,000 each in punitive damages. The total award averaged approximately $50,000 per worker or $2.5million.

SELI Canada appealed the decision to the BC Supreme Court. In December 2012, SELI agreed to a settlement offer by the union. The Latin American workers voted unanimously to accept a settlement. The settlement provided payments worth 50% of the original award.

<doc id="513272" wikidata="Q3080462" url="?curid=513272" title="Irving Janis">
<text>Irving Lester Janis (May 26, 1918 – November 15, 1990) was an American research psychologist at Yale University and a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley most famous for his theory of &quot;groupthink&quot;, which described the systematic errors made by groups when making collective decisions. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Janis as the 79th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

== Early years ==
Irving Janis was born on May 26, 1918, in Buffalo, New York. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Chicago in 1939, then received a Doctor of Philosophy in psychology from Columbia University in 1950.

== Career ==
During the Second World War, Janis was drafted into the U.S. Army, where he carried out studies of military morale. In 1947, Janis became a faculty member of the Yale University Psychology Department, where he remained for nearly forty years. He collaborated with Carl Hovland on his studies of attitude change, including the sleeper effect.

During his career, Janis studied decisionmaking in areas such as dieting and smoking. This work described how people respond to threats, as well as what conditions give rise to irrational complacency, apathy, hopelessness, rigidity, and panic.

Janis also made important contributions to the study of group dynamics. He did extensive work in the area of &quot;groupthink,&quot; which describes the tendency of groups to try to minimize conflict and reach consensus without sufficiently testing, analyzing, and evaluating their ideas. His work suggested that pressures for conformity restrict the thinking of the group, bias its analysis, promote simplistic and stereotyped thinking, and stifle individual creative and independent thought.

Janis wrote or co-wrote more than a dozen books, including &quot;Psychological Stress&quot; (1958), &quot;Victims of Groupthink&quot; (1972), &quot;Decision Making&quot; (1977), &quot;Groupthink&quot; (1982), and &quot;Crucial Decisions&quot; (1989).

In 1967, Janis was awarded the Socio-Psychological Prize by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1981, he received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award of the American Psychological Association. In 1991, he won the Distinguished Scientist Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology.

He retired from Yale University in 1985, and in 1986 was appointed Adjunct Professor of Psychology Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

== Personal life ==
Janis&#x27; father, Martin Janis, owned an art gallery in Los Angeles. His uncle was the pioneering art dealer Sidney Janis. Irving Janis was married to Marjorie Janis, with whom he had two daughters. He died of lung cancer on November 15, 1990, in Santa Rosa, California.

<text>The Gardner Pinnacles () are two barren rock outcrops surrounded by a reef and located in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

The Pūhāhonu volcano responsible for the pinnacles is northwest of Honolulu and from French Frigate Shoals. The total area of the two small islets, remnants of an ancient shield volcano, the world&#x27;s largest, is . The highest peak is . The surrounding reef has an area in excess of .

The Gardner Pinnacles were discovered and named in 1820 by the whaling ship &quot;Maro&quot;. The island may be the last remnant of one of the largest volcanoes on Earth. It holds the record for the largest and hottest shield volcano.

==History==
The Gardner Pinnacles were first discovered on June 2, 1820, by the American whaler &quot;Maro,&quot; commanded by Captain Joseph Allen.

In 1859, the position of the Gardner Pinnacles was determined by the survey schooner USS &quot;Fenimore Cooper&quot;.

The Gardner Pinnacles are home to the giant opihi (&quot;Cellana talcosa&quot;), a limpet known in Hawaiian as the , which is not found anywhere else in the world outside the Hawaiian Islands. Numerous insects live on the island.

In 1903 the Gardner Pinnacles became a part of the Hawaiian Islands Bird Reservation. In 1940 it became a part of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge. In the 21st century it is part of Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument wildlife refuge.

The Gardner Pinnacles were used as an emergency helicopter landing spot for the Hawaiian HIRAN project, an effort to determine the locations of area islands with great precision for navigational purposes. In the Hawaiian Archipelago, adjacent islands/reefs are French Frigate Shoals to the southeast, and Maro Reef to the northwest.

==Geology==

The island is made up of basalt rock, which comes from lava erupted between 14 and 12 million years ago. The rock is dark grey and dense, and has a high forsterite content implying the magma source was at .

According to a 2020 report in &quot;Earth and Planetary Science Letters&quot;, Pūhāhonu contains approximately of rock, based on a 2014 sonar survey. This would make it Earth&#x27;s largest single volcano. Only about one-third of that volume is exposed above the sea floor while the rest is buried beneath a ring of debris, broken coral, and other material that has eroded from the peak. By comparison, from sea floor to peak, Mauna Kea, on Hawaii&#x27;s Big Island, is the tallest shield volcano on Earth, but it is nowhere near as massive as Pūhāhonu. Another volcano on the Big Island is Mauna Loa; a 2013 study estimates Mauna Loa&#x27;s volume at which is believed to be an overestimate. Pūhāhonu is so heavy, researchers note, that it has caused Earth&#x27;s crust nearby—and thus the volcano itself—to sink hundreds of meters over millions of years. The Puhahonu volcano (Gardner) would be twice as big as Mauna Loa&#x27;s based on that research. 

The Pūhāhonu and West Pūhāhonu volcanoes result from the Hawaii hotspot which is fed by the Hawaiian plume which had a major magmatic flux pulse at the time. A longer magmatic flux pulse produced the Hawaiian Islands. The five seamounts of the Naifeh Chain to the north of Pūhāhonu have a completely different tectonic origin, and are older (Late Cretaceous). At one time they were hypothesised to be related to the Pūhāhonu volcano because of arch volcanism, which can not be the case, given the newly determined age difference.

==Ecology==
The island has one plant known to grow on it, the succulent sea purslane. However, there are over a dozen species of bird observed here, many nesting. There is also a variety of insect species on the island.

In the surrounding waters there is a variety of sealife, which is noted as habitat for a limpet, the giant ophi which lives in tidal areas of the rocky island. There are many species of fish and coral life in the nearby waters.

The large numbers of birds have coated many surfaces of the island in guano, giving it a whitish appearance.

Some of the fish species in the nearby waters include red lip parrotfish, doublebar goatfish, and reef triggerfish.

==Name==

The name Gardner comes from its discovery in 1820, when the Captain Joseph Allen of the ship &quot;Maro&quot; named it Gardner&#x27;s Island. They also discovered Maro Reef, which is named for that sailing ship.

It has sometimes been called Gardner Rock or Gardner Island, besides the Gardner Pinnacles.

The Hawaiian name, &quot;Pūhāhonu&quot;, means &#x27;turtle surfacing for air&#x27;, from &quot;pūhā&quot; &#x27;to breathe at the surface&#x27; and &quot;honu&quot; &#x27;turtle&#x27;.

<doc id="513275" wikidata="Q936766" url="?curid=513275" title="Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield">
<text>Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield, (23 July 1666 – 28 April 1732) was an English Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1705 to 1710. He was Lord Chief Justice from 1710 to 1718 and acted briefly as one of the regents before the arrival of King George I in Britain. His career ended when he was convicted of corruption on a massive scale and he spent the later years of his life in retirement at his home, Shirburn Castle in Oxfordshire.

==Early life==
Parker was born in Staffordshire, the son of Thomas Parker, an attorney at Leek and his wife Anne, daughter of Robert Venables of Nuneham, Cheshire. Sir Richard Levinge, 1st Baronet, a leading figure in Irish public life for three decades, was his first cousin. He was educated at Adams&#x27; Grammar School at Newport, Shropshire, Derby School in 1680 and at Rev. Samuel Ogden&#x27;s school at Derby. He was admitted at Inner Temple in 1684 and at Trinity College, Cambridge as a pensioner in 1685. On 23 April 1691, he married Janet Carrier, whose sister was the wife of William Anson and mother of the future Admiral Lord Anson. He was called to the bar in 1694. Together they had two children:

*Lady Elizabeth Parker (d. 21 Feb 1747) married Sir William Heathcote, 1st Baronet. They had six sons and three daughters.
*George Parker, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield (circa 1697 – 17 Mar 1764)

==Political career==
Parker was returned as Whig Member of Parliament for Derby at the 1705 English general election and was appointed QC and serjeant-at-law and knighted on 9 July 1705. He was returned unopposed for Derby at the 1708 British general election. Like other Whigs, he voted for the general naturalization of foreign Protestants in 1709. Being one of the leading Whig lawyers in the House of Commons, he was deeply involved in the moves to impeach Dr Sacheverell. He was appointed to the committee to draw up the articles of impeachment on 14 December 1709. The committee was later given the management of the trial. In 1710 he refused the office of Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, but was made a Privy Counsellor. The office of Lord Chief Justice fell vacant in 1710 and the administration wanted a quick replacement. Parker was appointed on 11 March 1710 and vacated his seat in the House of Commons.

==Lord Chief Justice==

From 1710 to 1718 Parker was involved in the prosecution of Henry Sacheverell. He made a vehement attack on Sacheverell and the high church clergy. He defended Whig propagandists and harried Tory publicists, including Defoe and Swift, on the slightest suspicion of favouring the Pretender. He spoke against the peace in the Privy Council in April 1713. In June 1714 he was given evidence of the recruiting activity of Jacobite agents which resulted in a price being placed on the Pretender&#x27;s head. On 1 August 1714, Queen Anne died, and her successor, King George I, was in Hanover, so Baron Parker was designated as one of the regents of Great Britain, Ireland and the realms beyond the seas until the new monarch arrived in Britain. His support for the Hanoverian succession was appreciated by King George I who reappointed him lord chief justice in 1714, and raised him to the peerage as Baron Parker of Macclesfield in 1716, in which year he purchased, and then commenced to restore, Shirburn Castle in Oxfordshire, which was to be the seat of the house of Macclesfield for the next 300 years. In 1718, because the King could not speak English, Parker read the King&#x27;s Speech in the House of Lords.

==Lord Chancellor==
In 1718, Parker became Lord Chancellor, and was given a pension for life. In 1721, he was advanced to the title Earl of Macclesfield with the additional subsidiary title of Viscount Parker.

==Impeachment==
In 1724, Parker was implicated in financial irregularities, but he did not resign as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain until 1725. In 1725, he was impeached and tried in the House of Lords. He was, unanimously, convicted of corruption for taking more than £100,000 in bribes (the equivalent of more than £11,000,000 today). He was fined £30,000 and placed in the Tower of London until payment was received. He was also struck off the roll of the Privy Council. He was a fabulously wealthy man, possibly because of his corruption, but as this money was confiscated, he had no resources to pay a fine. He spent most of the rest of his life at Shirburn Castle. He died in Soho Square, London on 28 April 1732 and was buried at Shirburn.

Parker was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1713. He was a friend of Bernard de Mandeville, whose satirical &quot;Fable of the Bees&quot; became highly controversial in the 1720s. He was patron of a grammar school built at Leek, his home town. In 1727, he was a pallbearer at the funeral of another friend, Sir Isaac Newton.

<text>The RAF Third Tactical Air Force (Third TAF), which was formed in South Asia in December 1943, was one of three tactical air forces formed by the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. It was made up of squadrons and personnel from the RAF, Indian Air Force (IAF) and the air forces of other Commonwealth countries. Third TAF was formed shortly after the establishment of South East Asia Command to provide close air support to the Fourteenth Army.

It was first formed on 19 December 1943 designated the Tactical Air Force (Burma) and renamed as the Third TAF on 28 December 1943. Along with parts of the USAAF Tenth Air Force, it was subordinate to Joint Allied Eastern Air Command which was also formed in December 1943.

As the Air Force was formed, it was felt that at last British forces could go over to the offensive against the Japanese in the Burma Campaign. A start was made towards establishing a general offensive in Arakan in early 1943, but this was forestalled by a Japanese offensive. The Japanese were decisively beaten, but they shifted the focus of their attack to central Burma. Third TAF gave sterling service to Fourteenth Army during the Battle of Kohima and the Battle of Imphal, strafing and bombing the besieging Japanese troops, often at very low level.

After the defeat of the Japanese by IV Corps and XXXIII Corps in Assam, the monsoon intervened before many counterattacks could take place. After the enforced period of reduced operations, the Third TAF supported the advance of Fourteenth Army against the Japanese forces. However, command arrangement changes at the end of 1944 cutting short the life of the Third TAF. It was redesignated HQ RAF Bengal and Burma on 4 December 1944.

The Third TAF had two commanders, Air Marshal John Baldwin up until 15 August 1944, and then Air Marshal Sir Alec Coryton.

==Composition==


The Third TAF was made up of several groups:

No. 221 Group RAF supporting IV Corps.

During the battle of Imphal there were seldom more than seven squadrons engaged at one time but over the three months&#x27; of the siege altogether 21 squadrons took part: including three from the Indian Air Force (Nos. 1, 2, 7 and 9). The RAF squadrons were Nos. 5, 11, 20, 28, 34, 42, 60, 81, 82, 84, 110, 113, 123, 136, 152, 176, No. 607 and No. 615.

No. 222 Group RAF

No 222 (General Reconnaissance) Group was based in Ceylon. The group role was, amongst others, reconnaissance over the Bay of Bengal. The RAF squadrons were at one time Nos. 8, 17, 22, 81, 89, 132, 135, 160, 191, 203, 205, 212, 217, 230, 240, 273, 292, 321 and 413.

No. 223 Group RAF with 151 Squadron (formerly 151 Operational Training Unit)

No. 224 Group RAF (commanding officer Air Commodore Alexander Gray) supporting the Indian XV Corps. In the 1943–44 campaigning season, this group comprised:

Three RAF fighter squadrons equipped with Supermarine Spitfires (this campaign marked the first time Spitfires were being used in South-East Asia)

Six fighter-bomber squadrons with Hawker Hurricanes (mainly Mk.IIc variants) including, No. 3 Squadron IAF and No. 4 Squadron IAF

One tactical reconnaissance squadron No. 6 Squadron IAF equipped with the Hurricane Mk.IIb

Two light bomber squadrons (one of which was No. 8 Squadron IAF commanded by Squadron-Leader Niranjan Prasa), equipped with Vultee Vengeances.

No. 226 Group RAF

226 group was one of the fighter groups based in Singapore. After the fall of Singapore the number of the group was transferred to the maintenance unit (No. 1301 MU RAF) of the tactical air force.

No. 227 Group RAF

227 group, based in Bombay, was the RAF training group based in India for the training of Indian pilots.

No. 229 Group RAF

229 Group was the transport part of the Tactical air force. The RAF squadrons were at one time Nos. 31, 52, 62, 96, 117, 194, 216, 232, 238, 267, 353, 435, 436, 668, 669, 670, 671 and 673.

No. 231 Group RAF

The role of the group was to provide heavy bombers for the campaign in Burma. The RAF bomber squadrons were at one time Nos. 99, 159, 200, No. 215, 355, 356, 357 and 358.

==Squadrons==
A Third TAF Communications Squadron was established on 28 December 1943, but disestablished on 4 December 1944 at RAF Comilla.

== Postwar in Burma ==
* HQ RAF Bengal and Burma was formed on 4 December 1944 by renaming the 3rd Tactical Air Force, still under Air Marshal Sir Alec Coryton.
* HQ RAF Bengal and Burma was renamed HQ RAF Burma on 27 February 1945.
* Renamed Air Headquarters Burma on 1 June 1945. Air Marshal Sir Hugh Saunders became Air Marshal Commanding from 1 August 1945.

Burma was relatively straightforward to deal with, although more complicated than Siam. Much of the colony had been conquered several months before the war ended, in the big British offensive of summer 1945. That gave Air Command, South East Asia, crucial breathing space to start getting the colony back on its feet before the massive increase in occupation duties postwar occurred. At the end of the war, it had 28 squadrons under its control. This quickly reduced as the demobilisation really kicked in. Again, the transport squadrons saw the largest amount of work, evacuating prisoners of war and internees and supplying garrisons and the civilian population. Second to the transport squadrons in workload were the photo reconnaissance aircraft. The opportunity was taken to complete the process of surveying SE Asia from the air, and using the survey to bring maps up to date. The survey was not completed until August 1947.

A light transport and liaison squadron, Air Headquarters Burma Communication Squadron, was established on 20 September 1945 at Baigachi, but disbanded within two months, on 14 November 1945 at RAF Mingaladon (now Yangon International Airport), by being downgraded to Air Headquarters Burma Communication Flight RAF.

After the clean-up immediately postwar, came the task of preparing Burma for independence. AHQ Burma moved out of Rangoon to Mingaladon on 1 January 1947. The Burmese Air Force was established on 16 January 1947 with former British aircraft. AHQ Burma was disbanded on 31 December 1947, and three months later Burma became independent.

<doc id="513283" wikidata="Q604055" url="?curid=513283" title="Indian Standard Time">
<text>Indian Standard Time (IST), sometimes also called India Standard Time, is the time zone observed throughout the Republic of India, with a time offset of UTC+05:30. India does not observe daylight saving time or other seasonal adjustments. In military and aviation time, IST is designated E* (&quot;Echo-Star&quot;). It is indicated as &quot;Asia/Kolkata&quot; in the IANA time zone database.

==History==

The Indian Standard Time was adopted on 1 January 1906 during the British era with the phasing out of its precursor Madras Time (Railway Time), and after Independence in 1947, the Union government established IST as the official time for the whole country, although Kolkata and Mumbai retained their own local time (known as Calcutta Time and Bombay Time) until 1948 and 1955, respectively. The Central observatory was moved from Madras to a location at Shankargarh Fort in Allahabad district, so that it would be as close to UTC+05:30 as possible.

Daylight Saving Time (DST) was used briefly during the China–India War of 1962 and the Indo-Pakistani Wars of 1965 and 1971.

===Former timezones===
==Calculation==
Indian Standard Time is calculated from the reference longitude of IST at 82°30&#x27;E passing near Mirzapur Clock Tower. In 1905, the meridian passing east of Allahabad was declared as a standard time zone for British India and was declared as IST in 1947 for the Dominion of India. This longitude of 82°30&#x27;E was chosen as the standard meridian for the whole country as it is located centrally between western India (local time UTC +05:00) and northeastern India (local time UTC +06:00). Currently, the National Physical Laboratory of India maintains the Indian Standard Time with the help of the Allahabad Observatory.

==Criticism and proposals==
The country&#x27;s east–west distance of more than covers over 29° of longitude, resulting in the sun rising and setting almost two hours earlier on India&#x27;s eastern border than in the Rann of Kutch in the far west. Inhabitants of the northeastern states have to advance their clocks with the early sunrise to avoid the extra consumption of energy after daylight hours.

In the late 1980s, a team of researchers proposed separating the country into two or three time zones to conserve energy. The binary system that they suggested involved a return to British-era time zones, but the recommendations were not adopted.

In 2001, the government established a four-member committee under the Ministry of Science and Technology to examine the need for multiple time zones and daylight saving. The findings of the committee, which were presented to Parliament in 2004 by the Minister of Science and Technology, Kapil Sibal, did not recommend changes to the unified system, stating that &#x27;the prime meridian was chosen with reference to a central station, and that the expanse of the Indian State was not large.&#x27;

Though the government has consistently refused to split the country into multiple time zones, provisions in labour laws such as the &quot;Plantations Labour Act, 1951&quot; allow the union and state governments to define and set the local time for a particular industrial area. In Assam, tea gardens follow a separate time zone, known as the &quot;Chaibagan&quot; or &quot;Bagan&quot; time (&#x27;Tea Garden Time&#x27;), which is one hour ahead of IST. Still, Indian Standard Time remains the only officially used time.

In 2014, Chief Minister of Assam Tarun Gogoi started campaigning for another time zone for Assam and other northeastern states of India. However, the proposal would need to be cleared by the union government.

In June 2017, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) indicated that it is once again studying the feasibility of two time zones for India. Proposals for creating an additional Eastern India Time (EIT at UTC+06:00), shifting default IST to UTC+05:00 and daylight saving (Indian Daylight Time for IST and Eastern India Daylight Time for EIT) starting on 14 April (Ambedkar Jayanti) and ending on 2 October (Gandhi Jayanti) was submitted to DST for consideration.

==Time signals==
Official time signals are generated by the Time and Frequency Standards Laboratory at the National Physical Laboratory in New Delhi, for both commercial and official use. The signals are based on atomic clocks and synchronised with the worldwide system of clocks that support Coordinated Universal Time.

Features of the Time and Frequency Standards Laboratory include:
*High-frequency broadcast service operating at 10 MHz under call sign &quot;ATA&quot; to synchronise the user clock within a millisecond;
*Indian National Satellite System satellite-based standard time and frequency broadcast service, which offers IST correct to ±10 microsecond and frequency calibration of up to ±10−10.
*Time and frequency calibrations made with the help of pico- and nanoseconds time interval frequency counters and phase recorders.

IST is taken as the standard time as it passes through almost the centre of India. To communicate the exact time to the people, the exact time is broadcast over the national All India Radio and Doordarshan television network. Telephone companies have dedicated phone numbers connected to mirror time servers that also relay the precise time. Another increasingly popular means of obtaining the time is through Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers.

As part of the Times Dissemination Project, which is overseen by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution, NavIC will take the position of GPS as the reference time provider at the National Physical Laboratory from 2025. With an atomic clock in each of the four other centers—Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhubaneswar, and Guwahati—the reference time from NavIC will be transmitted via an optical fiber link from the Faridabad center. Indian Standard Time must be used as the exclusive time reference for official, commercial, administrative, and legal documents, according to draft regulations published by the Department of Consumer Affairs. Exceptions will be permitted for astronomy, navigation, and scientific research.

<text>The Allied Expeditionary Air Force (AEAF), also known as the Allied Armies’ Expeditionary Air Force (AAEAF), was the expeditionary warfare component of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) which controlled the tactical air power of the Allied forces during Operation Overlord during World War II in 1944.

Its effectiveness was less than optimal on two counts. It did not function as the controlling headquarters for all Allied air forces, with the strategic forces of RAF Bomber Command and the US Eighth Air Force being retained by their national command authorities until pressure from U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower resulted in them being placed directly under SHAEF instead of AEAF. Its commander was also not universally liked. Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory was regarded by some as being too inept for his place in the high command.

It had two major components, the RAF Second Tactical Air Force and the USAAF Ninth Air Force. Each supported their own nation&#x27;s Army Group. It also had operational control of the Air Defence of Great Britain, but with that organisation not being under the control of SHAEF.

AEAF was dissolved after Leigh-Mallory was reassigned to command RAF forces in the Far East, later being killed in an air crash.

<doc id="513291" wikidata="Q2142580" url="?curid=513291" title="Telecommunications relay service">
<text>A telecommunications relay service, also known as TRS, relay service, or IP-relay, or Web-based relay service, is an operator service that allows people who are deaf, hard of hearing, deafblind, or have a speech disorder to place calls to standard telephone users via a keyboard or assistive device. Originally, relay services were designed to be connected through a TDD, teletypewriter (TTY) or other assistive telephone device. Services gradually have expanded to include almost any real-time text capable technology such as a personal computer, laptop, mobile phone, PDA, and many other devices. The first TTY was invented by deaf scientist Robert Weitbrecht in 1964. The first relay service was established in 1974 by Converse Communications of Connecticut.

==Types of services available==
Depending on the technical and physical abilities and physical environments of users, different call types are possible via relay services.

===TTY to voice/voice to TTY===
Once the most common type of TRS call, TTY calls involve a call from a deaf or hard-of-hearing person who utilizes a TTY to a hearing person. In this type of call, typed messages are relayed as voice messages by a TRS operator, (also known as &quot;Communication Assistant&quot; (CA), &quot;Relay Operator&quot; (RO), &quot;Relay Assistant&quot; (RA), or &quot;relay agent&quot; (agent)), and vice versa. This allows callers who are unable to use a regular telephone to be able to place calls to people who use a regular telephone and vice versa. When the person who is hearing is ready for a response, it is customary to say &quot;go ahead&quot; or &quot;GA&quot; to indicate that it is the TTY (teletypewriter) user&#x27;s turn to talk and &quot;stop keying&quot;, &quot;SK&quot;, or &quot;ready to hang up&quot; when ending the call and vice versa. This mode of communication has largely been superseded by other modes of communications, including the utilization of IP relay, VPs, VRS, and VRI.

===Voice carry over===
A common type of call is &quot;voice carry over&quot;, VCO. This allows a person who is hard of hearing or deaf but can speak to use their voice while receiving responses from a person who is hearing via the operator&#x27;s typed text. There are many variations of VCO, including two-line VCO and VCO with privacy.

====VCO with privacy====
The operator will not hear the VCO user&#x27;s voiced messages and the VCO user does not need to voice GA. The operator will hear the person who is hearing, and the person who is hearing must give the GA each time to alert the operator it is the VCO user&#x27;s turn. The VCO user does not need to voice GA, because the VCO user types it or presses the &quot;VCO GA&quot; button on the VCO phone when it&#x27;s the voice user&#x27;s turn to talk.

====Two-line VCO====
Two-line VCO allows a VCO user using a TTY or computer to call a TRS operator, who in turn calls the VCO user on a second telephone line, which serves as the voice line. The user puts the operator on a brief hold to initiate a three-way call with the hearing person. This method is frequently used by people who are hard of hearing and like to use some of their residual hearing as well as not having to say &quot;go ahead&quot;. With two-line VCO, the VCO user and the voice user can interrupt each other. VCO with Privacy cannot be used with two-line VCO, because the operator, VCO user, and hearing person are on a three-way call.

===Hearing carry over===
A less common call type is &quot;hearing carry over&quot; (HCO). HCO allows a person who is speech-disabled but can hear to use their hearing while sending responses to a person who is hearing via the HCO user&#x27;s typed text. The operator voices the HCO user&#x27;s typed messages, and then the HCO users picks up the handset and listens to the other voice user&#x27;s response. There are many variations of HCO, including two-line HCO and HCO with privacy.

====HCO with privacy====
The operator will not hear the voice user&#x27;s voiced messages and the voice user does not need to voice GA. The operator will voice for the person who is Speech-Disabled, and the person who is Speech–Disabled must give the GA each time to alert the operator it is the voice user&#x27;s turn. The voice user does not need to voice GA, because the HCO user can hear when the voice user finishes talking.

====2-line HCO====
Similar to 2-line VCO, 2-line HCO allows an HCO user using a TTY or computer to call a TRS operator, who in turn calls the HCO user on a second telephone line, which serves as the voice line. The user puts the operator on a brief hold to initiate a three-way call with the hearing person. This method is frequently used by people who are Speech-Disabled and like to use some of their residual speech as well as not having to type &quot;GA&quot;. With 2–Line HCO, the HCO user and the voice user can interrupt each other. HCO with Privacy cannot be used with 2–Line HCO, because the operator, HCO user, and hearing person are on a three–way call.

===Speech to speech===

Speech to speech (STS) exists for people who have speech disabilities. A specially–trained STS TRS operator revoices what the person with a speech disability says. STS is often used in combination with VCO for people who are deaf and have somewhat understandable speech, as well as two–Line HCO users. STS enables people with speech disabilities to call others (able-bodied speakers and other people with speech disabilities). It also enables people without speech disabilities to call people with speech disabilities. Anyone can call 711 in the U.S. and ask for Speech to Speech. STS is also available in Australia, New Zealand and Sweden.

Many STS users have Parkinson&#x27;s disease, cerebral palsy, ALS, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy or stroke. Other users stutter or have had a laryngectomy. STS also helps speech synthesizer users, users of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC.) AAC users can set their device next to a speakerphone. They ask the STS CA set up the call, negotiate the menu, introduce the call explaining AAC and then go into the background. This enables AAC users to communicate independently once the other party is on the line.

===Deafblind variation===
Telebraille also exists for people who are deafblind with the use of a TTY with a braille or regular keyboard and a refreshable braille display or LVD (Large Visual Display). A relay call of a user who is deafblind is directly related to a relay call of a TTY user, however, the text transmission speed is often reduced to increase the ability of the user who is deafblind to comprehend the moving braille on the braille TTY or large print on the LVD. Telebraille relay operators must be familiar with Braille contractions that users who are deafblind may use. Due to its implementation of a smaller keyboard, some TTY users with mobile disabilities may prefer to use a Telebraille, regardless of a sight disability or lack thereof.

=== Captioned telephone === 

Captioned telephone is a hybrid communication method that enables people who are hard of hearing, oral deaf or late–deafened to speak directly to another party on a telephone call. Typically, a telephone that displays real-time captions of what the hearing party speaks during a conversation. The captions are displayed on a screen embedded in the telephone base. A captioned telephone can also function exactly like a VCO when the user switches the device to VCO mode to do things like communicate with an HCO user directly, without relay. Captioned telephone services can be provided in traditional telephone environments as well as in VOIP environments.

Captions are created by a communications assistant using a computer with voice recognition software. The communications assistant listens to and revoices the hearing party&#x27;s side of the conversation into the microphone of a headset. A voice recognition program creates the captions and they are sent out to the captioned telephone where they are read by the user.

====IP CTS====

Internet Protocol Captioned Telephone Service (IP CTS), like other forms of CTS, allows users with some residual hearing, who can speak, to simultaneously listen to the other party and read captions of what the other party in a telephone conversation is saying.
IP CTS uses the Internet – rather than the telephone network – to provide the link and captions between the CTS user and the CTS service provider.

Prior to 2005, captioned telephone service was only available to people in states that had captioned telephone service as part of their state relay program. In 2005, the FCC made IP CTS a part of the federally mandated services.

IP CTS Requires an internet connection to deliver the captions to the user. Most also rely on their regular land-line telephone for the audio portion of the call, but some configurations of IP CTS allow the use of VOIP to carry the call audio. IP CTS has allowed captioned telephone service to be provided on smartphones and tablets.

====Two–line captioned telephone====
Captioned telephone can also be used with two lines. This is especially useful for users who prefer to give out their home phone number alone, instead of both the captioning service number and the toll-free captioning service number or for users who prefer to turn captions on and off anytime during the call. 2–Line captioned telephone can also be used with other relay services. For example, STS can be used with a 2–Line captioned telephone, for captioned telephone users with speech disabilities. 2–Line captioned telephone is only available to people in states that have 2–Line captioned telephone as part of their relay service or federal employees/contractors and American Indians.

====Web-based captioned telephone====
Web-based captioned telephone enables telephone calls to be placed with captions, by utilizing the World Wide Web browser window of a computer or smart phone. It is similar to a traditional captioned phone call except the user&#x27;s own telephone equipment is used, whilst the captions are viewed online instead of in the captioned telephone display screen.

===Other variations===
Many other call type variations are possible, including VCO to VCO, HCO to HCO, HCO to TTY, and VCO to TTY. Fundamentally, relay services have the ability to connect any two callers with different abilities over the telephone network. Voice callers in the United States can now access the service with a universal number: 711. After the number is dialled, the caller will receive instructions to complete the call to reach deaf callers.

===IP/web-based relay services===
IP relay services, called Web-based text relay services in Europe, provide functionality similar to TDD/TTY relay services. Instead of using telephone lines and TDD/TTY devices, they use an Internet connection and software running on computers or smartphones.

When using an IP relay service for an emergency call like 911 or 112, the relay operator will ask for the street address, city, and state from which the call is originating. If this information is not provided, the relay operator will be unable to complete the emergency call.

Most IP relay services support Web browsers, mobile phone apps, text messaging, WAP, instant messaging, and Text over IP (ToIP). Support for these technologies has enabled many Internet-connected devices to be used with relay services, including desktop and laptop personal computers, mobile phones, and PDAs.

===Video relay service===
Video relay service (VRS) allows people who use sign language to place phone calls by signing instead of typing. The VI (video interpreter) uses a webcam or videophone to voice the deaf, hard-of-hearing or, speech-disabled person&#x27;s signs to a hearing person and sign the hearing person&#x27;s words to the deaf, hard-of-hearing or speech-impaired person.

===Video remote interpreting===
Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) allows deaf or hard-of-hearing people who use sign language to communicate with hearing people in the same room. VRI addresses one limitation to VRS, which is that VRS cannot be used if the hearing person is in the same room with the deaf or hard-of-hearing person. VRI has proven to be useful for deaf or hard-of-hearing people in business meetings, doctor appointments, minor surgical procedures, and court proceedings.

==Accessibility==
In Canada and the United States, the telephone number 711 is used for the Telecommunications Relay Service.

In the U.S., every phone company is required to connect persons who dial 711 to a TRS call center from a working number. In July 2007, the Federal Communications Commission ruled that the 711 requirement extended to VOIP telephony.

Anyone can use 711; it is not limited to those who are deaf, hard of hearing, or speech impaired. As such, it has been used by those without hearing or speech disabilities to make long-distance calls free of charge with TRS providers who do not bill for them. Providers defend this as a necessary evil to maintain &quot;transparency&quot;, which is the belief that the operator and the mechanics of relay should generally go as unnoticed as possible in the call. This requires that TRS be as easy to use as normal telephones, which do not require their users to verify anything. Leaders in the deaf community defend this decision and generally retain strong support among service users with hearing and speech disabilities.

==Fraudulent uses in the United States==
The open structure of relay services has led to a number of complaints regarding its use as a vehicle for fraud. In 2004, news outlets, such as MSNBC, and several newspapers, including the &quot;Baltimore City Paper&quot;, ran stories of reported abuse of the relay system, such as users from international locations calling businesses in the United States to fraudulently purchase goods. This has also generated numerous complaints, particularly by those who were employed as relay operators, that so-called &quot;prank calls,&quot; where neither user requires the service and the caller is just attempting to have fun with a novel mode of communication. In December 2006, NBC ran another story where former operators alleged that &quot;85 to 90 percent&quot; of calls were scams. Since it is illegal for relay service companies to keep records, fraudulent users can operate with impunity. Fraudulent calls of both types have been cited as reasons for further relay regulation, and as causes for long hold times that must be endured by many legitimate users. Most businesses legally cannot have relay calls blocked due to the need for legitimate users to be accommodated, although businesses that are repeatedly victimized by pranks and/or scams often stop trusting relay calls or hang up on them because it is difficult to distinguish legitimate users from illegitimate ones; this is another way that the abusers of the service ultimately victimize the legitimate users, in addition to tying up the service from them.

In 2006, the FCC launched a campaign to gather feedback from the various Internet Protocol relay-certified companies operating within the United States to fight the wave of relay scams and pranks being made over the service. As brought up in the FCC&#x27;s released document, users on the IP-based relay services can thus place their calls anonymously, which cannot certify that the user in question really needs operator assistance or not. Furthermore, fraudulent calls of any nature cost millions to the American people yearly (based on the $1.293 per minute fee that is being paid for completed IP-based relay) to various relay providers for successfully completed calls.

Starting in November 2009, to help counter the problem of fraudulent use, the FCC began requiring all users of IP Relay to register their screen names with a default IP Relay provider. This, along with many IP Relay providers working to educate hearing users of the risks of fraudulent users (making it less lucrative for fraudulent users who no longer have an uneducated population to target), and other efforts has greatly reduced the amount of fraudulent use of the IP Relay system.

In March 2012, the United States federal government announced a lawsuit against AT&amp;T. The specific accusations state that AT&amp;T &quot;violated the False Claims Act by facilitating and seeking federal payment for IP Relay calls by international callers who were ineligible for the service and sought to use it for fraudulent purposes. The complaint alleges that, out of fears that fraudulent call volume would drop after the registration deadline, AT&amp;T knowingly adopted a non-compliant registration system that did not verify whether the user was located within the United States. The complaint further contends that AT&amp;T continued to employ this system even with the knowledge that it facilitated use of IP Relay by fraudulent foreign callers, which accounted for up to 95 percent of AT&amp;T’s call volume. The government’s complaint alleges that AT&amp;T improperly billed the TRS Fund for reimbursement of these calls and received millions of dollars in federal payments as a result.&quot;

<text>Notable Deaf people are typically defined as those who have profound hearing loss in both ears as a result of either acquired or congenital hearing loss. Such people may be associated with Deaf culture. Deafness (little to no hearing) is distinguished from partial hearing loss or damage (such as tinnitus), which is less severe impairment in one or both sides. The definition of deafness varies across countries, cultures, and time, though the World Health Organization classes profound hearing loss as the failure to hear a sound of 90 decibels or louder in a hearing test.

In addition to those with profound hearing loss, people without profound hearing loss may also identify as Deaf, often where the person is active within a Deaf community and for whom sign language is their primary language. Those who have mostly lived as a hearing person and acquire deafness briefly, due to a temporary illness or shortly before death, for example, are not typically classed as culturally Deaf.

<text>Robert Scott Lazar (; born January 26, 1959) is an American conspiracy theorist. In 1989, Lazar claimed to have been part of a classified US government project concerned with the reverse engineering of extraterrestrial technology; he also purported to have read government briefing documents that described alien involvement in human affairs over the past 10,000 years. A self-proclaimed physicist, Lazar supposedly worked at a secret site near the United States Air Force facility popularly known as Area 51. His story brought additional public attention to the facility and spawned conspiracy theories regarding government knowledge of extraterrestrial life.

Lazar has provided no evidence of alien life or technology, and his claims about his education and employment history are replete with fabrications. Lazar also has several criminal convictions: he was convicted in 1990 for his involvement in a prostitution ring, and again in 2006 for selling illegal chemicals. As well as being dismissed by skeptics, Lazar has been renounced by some ufologists. 

==Background==

Lazar graduated from high school late, in the bottom third of his class. The only science course he took was a chemistry class. He subsequently attended Pierce Junior College in Los Angeles.

In 1982, Lazar worked as a technician for a contractor company that provided support staff to the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility, within Los Alamos National Laboratory. He filed for bankruptcy in 1986, where he described himself as a self-employed film processor. Lazar owns and operates United Nuclear Scientific Equipment and Supplies, which sells a variety of materials and chemicals.

==Claims==
===Education===
Lazar claims to have obtained master&#x27;s degrees in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and in electronics from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). However, both universities show no record of him. Scientists Stanton T. Friedman and Donald R. Prothero have stated that nobody with Lazar&#x27;s high school performance record would be accepted by either institution. Lazar is unable to supply the names of any lecturers or fellow students from his alleged tenures at MIT and Caltech; one supposed Caltech professor, William Duxler, was in fact located at Pierce Junior College and had never taught at Caltech. Friedman asserted, &quot;Quite obviously, if one can go to MIT, one doesn&#x27;t go to Pierce. Lazar was at Pierce at the very same time he was supposedly at MIT more than 2,500 miles away.&quot;

===Employment===

Lazar claims to be a physicist and to have worked in this capacity during his tenure at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility. This assertion was echoed by local journalist Terry England, who interviewed Lazar about his interest in jet-powered cars in 1982; some media outlets have since dubbed him a &quot;physicist&quot;. Asked about the article in 2021, however, England admitted that he took Lazar&#x27;s claims at face value and did not fact-check his credentials as a physicist. Inquiry into Lazar&#x27;s position at Los Alamos revealed his role to have been a technician for a contractor firm, and that he worked neither as a physicist or for the lab directly. As such, the facility retains no records on Lazar, whom Prothero states was &quot;in short, rather a minor player&quot;. The Smithsonian, along with various other mainstream news outlets, have stated that his designation as a &quot;physicist&quot; is self-proclaimed.

Since 1989, Lazar has achieved public notoriety as an Area 51 conspiracy theorist. In May of that year, he appeared in an interview with investigative reporter George Knapp on Las Vegas TV station KLAS, under the pseudonym &quot;Dennis&quot; and with his face hidden, to discuss his purported employment at &quot;S-4&quot;, a subsidiary facility he claimed exists near the Nellis Air Force Base installation known as Area 51. He claims that the said facility was adjacent to Papoose Lake, which is located south of the main Area 51 facility at Groom Lake. He claimed the site consisted of concealed aircraft hangars built into a mountainside. Lazar said that his job was to help with the reverse engineering of one of nine flying saucers, which he alleged were extraterrestrial in origin. He claims one of the flying saucers, the one he coined the &quot;Sport Model&quot;, was manufactured out of a metallic substance similar in appearance and touch to liquid titanium. In a subsequent interview that November, Lazar appeared unmasked and under his own name, where he claimed that his job interview for work at the facility was with contractor EG&amp;G and that his employer was the United States Navy. EG&amp;G stated it had no records on him. His supposed employment at a Nellis Air Force Base subsidiary has also been discredited by skeptics, as well as by the United States Air Force.

Lazar has claimed that the propulsion of the studied vehicle ran on an antimatter reactor and was fueled by the chemical element with atomic number 115 (E115), which at the time was provisionally named &quot;ununpentium&quot; and had not yet been artificially created. (It was first synthesized in 2003 and later named moscovium.) He said that the propulsion system relied on a stable isotope of E115, which allegedly generates a gravity wave that allowed the vehicle to fly and to evade visual detection by bending light around it. 

No stable isotopes of moscovium have yet been synthesized. All have proven extremely radioactive, decaying in a few hundred milliseconds. Lazar said the craft was dismantled, and the reactor he studied was topped by a sphere or semi-sphere which emitted a force field capable of repulsing human flesh. He explained that the craft was split into two main levels. 

The reactor was positioned at the center of the upper level, with an antenna extending to the top, surrounded by three &quot;gravity amplifiers&quot;. These connected to &quot;gravity emitters&quot; on the lower level, which can rotate 180 degrees to output a &quot;gravity beam or anti-gravity wave&quot; and that the craft would then travel &quot;belly first&quot; into this distortion field.
Lazar has claimed that during his joining of the program he read briefing documents describing the historical involvement of Earth for the past 10,000 years with extraterrestrial beings described as grey aliens from a planet orbiting the twin binary star system Zeta Reticuli. As of September 2019, no extrasolar planets have been found in the Zeta Reticuli system. In 1989, Lazar said the seats of the saucer he saw were approximately child-sized and that he had seen alien cadavers of a corresponding size. 

He said that while walking down a hallway at S-4, he briefly glanced through a door window and saw what he interpreted as two men in lab coats facing down and talking to &quot;something small with long arms&quot;. Three decades later, he said he did not think he saw an alien, but speculated that he saw a doll used as reference for the size of the alleged aliens and that a nickname used for them was &quot;the kids&quot;. Lazar&#x27;s claims about S-4 brought additional public attention to its supposed parent facility, Area 51, and spawned conspiracy theories regarding government knowledge of extraterrestrial life.

Lazar alleges that his employment and education records have been erased; Friedman, Prothero and author Timothy D. Callahan find this implausible. Currently, a Bob Lazar Archive exists that documents interview transcripts and includes other various documents.
 His story has drawn significant media attention, controversy, supporters, and detractors. Lazar has no evidence of alien life or technology and remains a polarizing figure among ufologists.

In 2017, Lazar&#x27;s workplace was raided by the FBI and local police, which Lazar theorizes was to recover &quot;element 115&quot;, a substance he says he took from a government lab. Records obtained through a freedom of information request show that the raid was part of a murder investigation to determine whether his company sold thallium to a murder suspect in Michigan. Lazar is not listed as a suspect in the investigation.

==Public appearances and media==
Lazar and long-time friend Gene Huff ran the Desert Blast festival, an annual festival in the Nevada desert for pyrotechnics enthusiasts. The festival started in 1987, but was only formally named in 1991. The name was inspired by Operation Desert Storm. The festival features homemade explosives, rockets, jet-powered vehicles, and other pyrotechnics, with the aim of emphasizing the fun aspect of chemistry and physics.

Lazar was featured in producer George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell&#x27;s documentary &quot;Bob Lazar: Area 51 &amp; Flying Saucers&quot; and Joe Rogan&#x27;s podcast. Lazar had met and discussed his alleged works on UFOs with Navy pilot and commander David Fravor, who witnessed the USS &quot;Nimitz&quot; UFO incident in 2004.

Lazar has been married twice.

==Criminal convictions==
In 1990, Lazar was arrested for aiding and abetting a prostitution ring. This was reduced to felony pandering, to which he pleaded guilty. He was ordered to do 150 hours of community service, stay away from brothels, and undergo psychotherapy.

In 2006, Lazar and his wife Joy White were charged with violating the Federal Hazardous Substances Act for shipping restricted chemicals across state lines. The charges stemmed from a 2003 raid on United Nuclear&#x27;s business offices, where chemical sales records were examined. United Nuclear pleaded guilty to three criminal counts of introducing into interstate commerce, and aiding and abetting the introduction into interstate commerce, of banned hazardous substances. In 2007, United Nuclear was fined $7,500 for violating a law prohibiting the sale of chemicals and components used to make illegal fireworks.

Journalist Stephen Rodrick and author Neil Nixon write that further doubts have been cast on Lazar&#x27;s credibility due to his criminal activity. Author Timothy Good and filmmaker Jeremy Corbell, who have perpetuated Lazar&#x27;s story, concur with this assertion.

<doc id="513314" wikidata="Q463524" url="?curid=513314" title="American Basketball League (1925–1955)">
<text>The American Basketball League (ABL) was an early professional basketball league. During six seasons from 1925–26 to 1930–31, the ABL was the first attempt to create a major professional basketball league in the United States.

==History==
Joseph Carr, who was in 1925 the president of then-new National Football League, organized the ABL from nine of the best independent pro teams from the East and the Midwest. George Halas of the NFL Chicago Bears was the owner of the Chicago Bruins, and department store magnate Max Rosenblum, a part owner of the NFL&#x27;s Cleveland Bulldogs, financed the Cleveland Rosenblums. Future NFL (Washington Redskins) owner George Preston Marshall, the owner of a chain of laundries, was owner of the Washington Palace Five. Other teams were the Boston Whirlwinds, Brooklyn Arcadians, Buffalo Bisons, Detroit Pulaski Post Five, Fort Wayne Hoosiers, and Rochester Centrals. The New York Celtics were one of the top teams at the time, but declined to join the ABL, instead opting to be an &quot;at large&quot; team.

The league adopted a format with a split season that was divided into two halves, with the winner of the first half playing the winner of the second half for the championship. The 1925–26 season saw Cleveland, the second half winner, defeat Brooklyn, winner of the first half of the season, three games to none. The Boston Whirlwinds, in conflict with the other owners over the status of the Celtics, refused to take part in the second half of the season and dropped out of the league.

Five games into the 1926–27 season, the original Celtics were fully admitted to replace the Brooklyn franchise, and won 32 of the remaining 37 games.

For the 1927–28 season, the ABL had an Eastern (New York, Philadelphia, Rochester and Washington) and Western (Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and Fort Wayne) division, with the two best teams in each division going to playoffs, and a championship between the playoff winners. Playing in Madison Square Garden, the Celtics finished with a 40–9 record in the regular season and won the championship. However, at season&#x27;s end, the team was voted out of the league by the other owners. The ABL played three more seasons and then, with only five teams playing at the end of 1930–31, folded during the Great Depression.

After more than two years, the league was reorganized in 1933, but as an East Coast league, with teams in Pennsylvania and New York City metro area.

The league did take some measures to help modernize the game. One of the major issues that had plagued basketball was players jumping from team to team. To combat this, teams began signing players to contracts. Often these contracts went up to $1,500 per month, which was considerably more than what an average laborer was making at the time ($15 per week). New rules that were implemented included making backboards mandatory, adding a three-second lane violation, and implementing foul outs. The ABL also eliminated the double dribble, which was done to encourage many of the game&#x27;s top college stars to play in the league.

One of the early stars for the league was Cleveland&#x27;s Honey Russell whose 7.4 points was the second highest average in the league. Cleveland drew well, bringing in nearly 10,000 fans a game, while Brooklyn could only draw around 2,000.

===1926–27 season===
The league knew they had a problem when it came to the Celtics. So the league opted to force the hands of the Celtics ownership. The teams in the league agreed prohibiting any games against the Celtics, and this left the Celtics with a dilemma. They could either join the American Basketball League, or they could try and schedule games against lesser competition, thus possibly losing out on drawing bigger crowds. In the end, ownership decided that it was worth the draw to join the ABL, so they did. The team won the league title by defeating Cleveland, which, despite still being a good team, was not the dominant force that had won the title the year before. Honey Russell, without a doubt the team&#x27;s top star, got into a dispute with owner Max Rosenblum, thus leading to his contract being sold to Chicago. Cleveland also lost Vic Hanson, who had been one of the top college stars, but did not like the rough style of the pro level, and also did not care for the overall lack of playing time he was getting. The Celtics represented the borough of Brooklyn, which had been without a team after the Brooklyn Arcadians dropped out of the league. The Celtics assumed Brooklyn&#x27;s 0–5 start. The league also lost the team in Detroit, which dropped out after a 0–6 start.

===1927–28 season===
Once again, the ABL placed a team in Detroit, and once again it was a failure. Detroit was 5-13 when it opted to disband on January 3, 1927. The Washington franchise was shifted to Brooklyn on that same day. The Celtics this time represented the city of New York. Joe Lapchick, Nat Holman, Pete Berry, Dutch Dehnert and Davey Banks led the New York Celtics to a 40–9 record. The playoffs saw Fort Wayne defeat Cleveland 2 games to 0, and New York defeated Philadelphia 2 games to zero. New York defeated Fort Wayne 3 games to 1 in the championship series. The playoffs would be Philadelphia&#x27;s last appearance in the league, as the team folded, becoming the third league team to revoke their presence.

===1928–29 season===
During the 1927–28 season, the league divided the league into divisions, Eastern and Western. The 1928–29 season saw the format discarded. The Celtics were dominant, to the point that the league was suffering. The rally cry of &quot;Break up the Celtics&quot; was heeded. Players were dispersed to other teams, and this also resolved an issue for Celtics owner Jim Furey, who had issues with Madison Square Garden management. The arena&#x27;s owners sought to evict the Celtics, who despite being a dominant team, never drew well at home. Cleveland, through purchase and trades, ended up with nearly all of the Celtics players on their roster. Cleveland ran away with the title, defeating Fort Wayne four games to none in the playoffs.

===1929–30 season===
The New York Stock Market crashed on October 29, 1929. John J. O&#x27;Brien the League&#x27;s president, took the viewpoint that the &quot;Great Depression&quot; economic / financial slump would not last long, and the ABL continued business as usual. Former Celtics owner Jim Furey had just been released from prison, and put together a new version of the Celtics. However, the players were quickly becoming past their prime, and Nat Holman didn&#x27;t play weekend games because he was a coach for the City College of New York. However, Cleveland still managed to win the league title, defeated Rochester and their star player, Tiny Hearn a six-foot, nine inch rookie star from Georgia Tech. However, there would never be a dynasty for Cleveland. The stock market crash took its toll on the ABL. During the 1930–31 season, Max Rosenblum shocked the world of basketball when he announced that his Cleveland team would cease operations. Rosenblum was unable to pay the contracts that his players had signed. George Halas at the end of the season, opted to fold his struggling Chicago Bruins club, and Toledo, which featured three former Celtics stars (Denhert, Lapchick, and Berry) shockingly finished in last place, with a record of four wins and eleven losses. Fort Wayne defeated Chicago, and lost to Brooklyn in the finals, as Brooklyn won what would ultimately be the league&#x27;s last championship.

<text>The Boykos or Boikos (; ; ; ), or simply Highlanders (; ), are an ethnolinguistic group located in the Carpathian Mountains of Ukraine, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland. Along with the neighbouring Lemkos and Hutsuls, the Boykos are considered a sub-group of Rusyns and speak a distinct East Slavic dialect. Within Ukraine, the Boykos and other Rusyns are seen as a sub-group of ethnic Ukrainians. Boykos differ from their neighbors in dialect, dress, folk architecture, and customs.

==Etymology==

Regarding the origin of the name Boyko there exist several etymological hypotheses, but it is generally considered, as explained by priest Joseph Levytsky in his &quot;Hramatyka&quot; (1831), that it derives from the particle . Specifically, it derives from the exclamation &quot;бой!, бойє!&quot; (&quot;&lt; bo-i-je &gt;&quot;), meaning &quot;it is really so!&quot;, which is often used by the population. The 19th-century scholar Pavel Jozef Šafárik, with whom Franjo Rački and Henry Hoyle Howorth agreed, argued a direct connection of the Boykos with the region of &quot;Boiki&quot; mentioned in the 10th century &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;, but this thesis is outdated and rejected, as most scholars, Mykhailo Hrushevsky among them, already dismissed it in the 19th century because &quot;Boiki&quot; is a clear reference to Bohemia, which in turn derives from the Celtic tribe of Boii. The derivation from Boii, is also disputed because there is not enough evidence. They are also called Vrchovints (Highlanders). As in the case of Hutsuls and Lemkos, they are recorded in historical and ethnographic sources since the 18th and 19th century.

Some people otherwise identifiable as Boykos regard that name as derogatory and call themselves highlanders (verkhovyntsi).

==Origin==

Boykos are either considered one of the descendants of East Slavic tribes, specifically White Croats who lived in the region, possibly also Ulichs who arrived from the East, or Vlach shepherds who later immigrated from Transylvania.

==Demography==
In the Boyko Region (Polish: Bojkowszczyzna, Ukrainian/Boyko: Boikivshchyna), there lived up to 400,000 people of whom most were Boykos. They also lived in Sanok, Lesko and Przemyśl County of the Podkarpackie Voivodeship in Poland, before the Population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine and the forced relocation of Rusyns and Ukrainians in Poland in 1947. In commemoration of Boykos, Ukraine&#x27;s national parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, in 2016 renamed Telmanove Raion into Boykivske Raion where Boykos were deported from Czarna, Bieszczady County (today in Poland) after the 1951 Polish–Soviet territorial exchange. It is estimated from the evidence available that in 1970 there lived 230,000 people of Boyko origin.

In Ukraine, the classification of Boykos as an ethnicity distinct from Ukrainians is controversial. The deprecated and archaic term Ruthenian, while also derived from &quot;Rus&#x27;&quot;, is ambiguous, as it technically may refer to Rusyns and Ukrainians, as well as Belarusians and in some cases Russians, depending on the historical period. According to the 2001 Ukraine census, only 131 people identified themselves as Boykos, separate from Ukrainians. This is also on top of many attempts within the USSR and modern day Ukraine to assimilate the Rusyn people into the modern Ukraine state. In the Polish census of 2011, 258 people stated Boyko as a national-ethnic identity, with 14 of those people listing it as their only national-ethnic identity.

==Location==
*Poland: southeasternmost part of Poland (Podkarpackie Voivodeship).
*Ukraine: central and western half of the Carpathians in Ukraine across such regions as the southern Lviv Oblast (Stryi, Drohobych, and Sambir Raions), western Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (Kalush Raion) and parts of the northeastern Zakarpattia Oblast (Mizhhiria Raion)
*Northeast Slovakia

To the west of Boykos live Lemkos, east or southeast Hutsuls, northward Dnistrovyans, Opolyans.

==Religion==
Most Boykos belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, with a minority belonging to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. The distinctive wooden church architecture of the Boyko region is a three-domed church, with the domes arranged in one line, and the middle dome slightly larger than the others.

==Notable people==
*Yuriy Drohobych (1450–1494), first doctor of medicine in Ukraine, rector of the University of Bologna (1481–1482), professor at Jagiellonian University (1488).
*Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny (1582–1622), Ukrainian political and civic leader, Hetman of Ukrainian Zaporozhian Cossacks (1616–1622).
*Ivan Franko (1856–1916), Ukrainian poet, writer and political activist.

<text>Charles Benjamin Amirkhanian (born January 19, 1945; Fresno, California) is an American composer. He is a percussionist, sound poet, and radio producer of Armenian origin. He is mostly known for his electroacoustic and text-sound music. 

== Career ==
Amirkhanian received his Master of Fine Arts from Mills College in 1980, where he studied electronic music and techniques of sound recording. He was music director of Pacifica Radio&#x27;s KPFA-FM in Berkeley, California, from 1969 to 1992, and he was a lecturer in the Interdisciplinary Creative Arts Department at San Francisco State University from 1977 to 1980.

Amirkhanian is the executive director and artistic director of the Other Minds Music Festival in San Francisco, which he co-founded with Jim Newman in 1992. He has played a key role in recording and championing the work of Conlon Nancarrow and George Antheil, among others.

In 1984, the American Music Center awarded him its Letter of Distinction for service to American composers through his work at KPFA FM in Berkeley, California. This was followed in 2005 by another for his co-founding and directing the Other Minds Festival in San Francisco. From ASCAP in 1989 he received the Deems Taylor Award, also for service to American composers. Amirkhanian received a 1997 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award.

<text>Courtney Solomon (born September 1, 1970) is a film producer from Toronto, Ontario. He has been involved with production, marketing, and distribution of over 80 movies. In 2000, at the age of 29, he produced and directed the critically panned &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; film.

==Career==

At 19, Solomon formed Sweetpea Entertainment to acquire the film rights to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; became his first production and direction project. It was both a box office and critical disappointment 

As owner of Sweetpea Entertainment, Solomon sought to acquire media rights for potential adaptation into television series or MMORPGs. In 1996, in exchange for the equity position and media rights to &quot;Traveller&quot;, Sweetpea advanced the funds to establish Imperium Games, a company dedicated solely to &quot;Traveller&quot;.

He later formed After Dark Films to produce horror, thriller, and action titles. He launched it with &quot;An American Haunting&quot;, which he wrote, produced, and directed. It is a story based on Tennessee&#x27;s Bell Witch legend. It opened #2 in the US, staying in the top ten films for 6 weeks. This success resulted in a long-term distribution and co-production arrangement with Lionsgate Films. Today, After Dark owns its own film library of over 80 films.

In 2014, Solomon partnered with Mark Canton on a number of films, including &quot;Cake&quot;. Other films were &quot;Mr. Church&quot; (Eddie Murphy), &quot;The Comedian&quot; (Robert De Niro and Leslie Mann), &quot;The Yellow Birds&quot; (Tye Sheridan, Alden Ehrenreich, Jack Huston, Jennifer Aniston, and Toni Collette), and &quot;Burn Your Maps&quot; (Vera Farmiga and Jacob Tremblay).

In 2018, he acquired the rights to and produced the first film based on the novel series &quot;After&quot;. The film of the same name was released in April 2019. The sequel, &quot;After We Collided&quot;, was released in 2020. In the same year, he also acquired the rights to the underground comic universe of the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers created by Gilbert Shelton in 1968.

<doc id="513321" wikidata="Q3029776" url="?curid=513321" title="Discectomy">
<text>A discectomy (also called open discectomy, if done through a 1/2 inch or larger skin opening) is the surgical removal of abnormal disc material that presses on a nerve root or the spinal cord. The procedure involves removing a portion of an intervertebral disc, which causes pain, weakness or numbness by stressing the spinal cord or radiating nerves. The traditional open discectomy, or Love&#x27;s technique, was published by Ross and Love in 1971. Advances have produced visualization improvements to traditional discectomy procedures (e.g. microdiscectomy, an open discectomy using an external microscope typically done through a 1-inch or larger skin opening), or endoscopic discectomy (the scope passes internally and typically done through a 2 mm skin opening or larger, up to 12 mm). In conjunction with the traditional discectomy or microdiscectomy, a laminotomy is often involved to permit access to the intervertebral disc. Laminotomy means a significant amount of typically normal bone (the lamina) is removed from the vertebra, allowing the surgeon to better see and access the area of disc herniation.

==Endoscopic discectomy==
Small or ultra-small endoscopic discectomy (called Nano Endoscopic Discectomy) does not have internal cutting or bone removal and, due to the small size, is not called &quot;open&quot;. These procedures do not cause post-laminectomy syndrome (failed back syndrome).

==Microdiscectomy==
Microdiscectomy is a spine operation with a smaller incision than traditional discectomy, in which a portion of a herniated nucleus pulposus is removed by way of a surgical instrument, while using an external operating microscope for lighting and magnification. They may be &quot;open&quot;, i.e., with a larger incision, or minimally invasive, i.e., with a 1.5 to 2.0 cm surgical incision.

=== Indications ===
Microdiscectomy may be a surgical option for patients with a single-level disc herniation and evidence of nerve root compression with residual unremitting radicular symptoms after failed conservative treatment. Cauda equina syndrome and progressive or new motor deficits are among the urgent surgical indications for microdiscectomy.

=== Contraindications ===
Contraindications include additional pathologies, including infection, tumor, or segmental instability or vertebral fracture where fusion or instrumentation may be required. However, segmental instability and spondylolisthesis may be considered relative contraindications by some physicians.

== Discectomy for athletes ==
Degeneration caused by years of repetitive mechanical stress can cause the disc of an athlete to be herniated. Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a critical injury for elite athletes that could cause extreme pain and significantly hinder performance. To relieve the pain, athletes usually go through microdiscectomy. However, the results of treatments in elite athletes differ due to the demand for optimal treatment, short recovery period, and high performance after the operation.

Most athletes return to their pre-surgery level after a discectomy. A systematic review of 450 athletes shows that 75–100% of athletes return to play after surgery. The average recovery period ranged from 2.8 to 8.7 months. Athletes recovered an average of 64.4% to 103.6% of their preoperative performance and had reported career longevity of 2.6 to 4.8 years post-return.
There are unsuccessful cases of discectomy for certain athletes like Tiger Woods, a world-famous PGA Tour golfer. Woods underwent three microdiscectomy procedures from 2014 to 2015 which failed to alleviate his pain. The removal of disc material due to discectomy meant that Woods eventually had to go through spinal fusion to recover.

==In the US==
In the U.S., it has been estimated that the Medicare system spends over $300 million annually on lumbar discectomies.

<text>Antelope is a census-designated place in Sacramento County, California, United States located approximately northeast of downtown Sacramento and southwest of Roseville. The population was 45,770 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the community has a total area of . Antelope is mostly flat, with very few hills and no major bodies of water.

The northern border of Antelope falls directly onto the line between Sacramento County and Placer County.

The eastern border first follows Roseville Road south from the county line to Butternut Drive. Then the border continues in the same general direction to Antelope Road, so that parcels on Adagio Way, Andante Drive and Katella Way are within Antelope CDP.

The southern border follows Antelope Road.

The western border has two parts. The first part extends from Antelope Rd northwards toward Elverta Rd along 28th St. The second part extends from Elverta Rd towards the Placer county line, along Dry Creek.

The boundaries were drawn and the town name established by a vote in 1993 to establish the community&#x27;s identity. The Antelope, CA town designation began July 1, 1994. The ZIP code for Antelope: 95843 

==History==

In the late 1800s, Antelope was the only significant settlement in the Center Township, an area bounded on the North by the Placer county line, on the East by what is now Sunrise Blvd., on the South by the American River, and on the West by the line along 20th St in Rio Linda south to Ethan Way in the Arden-Arcade area. The population of the entire township in 1880 was about 400 people. Many of the railroad workers made their homes here and eventually stayed permanently. Gradually, workers left the area and Antelope became just another small community with little business.

On April 28, 1973, Antelope consisted of a post office, general store and a half-dozen homes. However, at 8:03 a.m., a rail car loaded with aircraft bombs exploded in the southern part of the Southern Pacific&#x27;s Roseville Yard, destroying the general store and damaging most of the homes. This event changed Antelope forever - it basically was blown away.

What is known as Antelope today mostly began as a planned community in the late 1980s. It consisted of mainly single-family homes and apartments. Due to the relative newness of the community, most homes are new and the area is well planned out. The proposed and ultimate closure of nearby McClellan Air Force Base between the years 1993-2001 did have a slowing-down economic impact upon this area (the “North Watt Avenue corridor”). Antelope received its own postmark and recognition as a community by the U.S. Postal Service on 1 July 1994.

<text>A steno machine, stenotype machine, shorthand machine, stenograph or steno writer is a specialized chorded keyboard or typewriter used by stenographers for shorthand use. In order to pass the United States Registered Professional Reporter test, a trained court reporter or closed captioner must write speeds of approximately 180, 200, and 225 words per minute (wpm) at very high accuracy in the categories of literary, jury charge, and testimony, respectively. Some stenographers can reach up to 375 words per minute, according to the website of the California Official Court Reporters Association (COCRA).

The stenotype keyboard has far fewer keys than a conventional alphanumeric keyboard. Multiple keys are pressed simultaneously (known as &quot;chording&quot; or &quot;stroking&quot;) to spell out whole syllables, words, and phrases with a single hand motion. This system makes realtime transcription practical for court reporting and live closed captioning. Because the keyboard does not contain all the letters of the English alphabet, letter combinations are substituted for the missing letters. There are several schools of thought on how to record various sounds, such as the StenEd, Phoenix, and Magnum Steno theories.

==History==

The first shorthand machine (the word &quot;stenotype&quot; was not used for another 80 years or more) punched a paper strip and was built in 1830 by Karl Drais, a German inventor. The first machine was made in 1863 by the Italian Antonio Michela Zucco and was in actual use from 1880 in the Italian Senate. In New York City on December 24, 1875, John Celivergos Zachos invented a stenotype and filed patent number 175892 for type writers and phenotypic notation application. In 1879, Miles M. Bartholomew invented the shorthand machine. A French version was created by Marc Grandjean in 1909. The direct ancestor of today&#x27;s stenotype was created by Ward Stone Ireland in about 1913, and the word &quot;stenotype&quot; was applied to his machine and its descendants sometime thereafter.

==Modern hardware==
Most modern stenotype keyboards have more in common with computers than they do with typewriters or QWERTY computer keyboards. Most contain microprocessors, and many allow sensitivity adjustments for each individual key. They translate stenotype to the target language internally using user-specific dictionaries, and most have small display screens. They typically store a full day&#x27;s work in non-volatile memory of some type, such as an SD card. These factors influence the price, along with economies of scale, as only a few thousand stenotype keyboards are sold each year. , student models, such as a Wave writer, sold for about US$1,500 and top-end models sold for approximately US$5,000. Machines that were 10 to 15 years old still resold for upward of $350.

The Open Steno Project has written free open-source software, including Plover, and has developed cheap open-source hardware for stenography. Plover software translates keypresses to Stenotype on any modern keyboard, with a preference given to ortholinear keyboards that have NKRO functionality. 

=== Manufacturers ===
Stenograph is by far the largest manufacturer of American stenotype keyboards with an estimated market share in excess of 90%. Their top models are the Luminex professional writer and the Wave student writer. The Stentura paper-based writers and the paperless Élan writers preceded the current models. There were two other large manufacturers in the 1980s (Xscribe, with the StenoRAM line and BaronData with the Transcriptor line). Stenograph purchased both companies and discontinued their products. The current manufacturers in the US include:
* Advantage Software (Passport and Passport Touch)
* Neutrino Group (Gemini, Revolution, &amp; Infinity writers)
* ProCAT (Stenopaq, Flash, Stylus, Impression, and Xpression)
* Stenograph (Stentura, élan Mira, Fusion, élan Cybra, Wave, Diamante and Luminex)
* Stenovations (LightSpeed) 
* Word Technologies (Tréal) 

=== Hobbyist keyboards ===
Many steno enthusiasts are making and selling keyboards designed for use with Plover, the open source steno software. Most of these keyboards range from about $100 to $200 and allow the user to use stenography on their computer through Plover. Vendors include:

* g Heavy Industries (Georgi)
* Nolltronics (EcoSteno)
* SOFT/HRUF (Splitography)
* StenoKeyboards (The Uni)
* Stenomod (TinyMod)
* Stenography Store (Starboard)

== Keyboard layout ==
Stenotype keys normally are made of a hard, high-luster acrylic material with no markings. The accompanying image shows the keyboard layout of the American stenotype machine.

In &quot;home position&quot;, the fingers of the left hand rest along the gap between the two main rows of keys to the left of the asterisk (little finger on the &quot;S&quot; to forefinger on the &quot;H&quot; and &quot;R&quot;). These fingers are used to generate initial consonants. The fingers of the right hand lie in the corresponding position to the right of the asterisk (forefinger on &quot;FR&quot; to little finger on &quot;TS&quot;), and are used for final consonants. The thumbs produce the vowels.

The system is roughly phonetic; for example the word &quot;cat&quot; would be written by a single stroke expressing the initial K, the vowel A, and the final T.

To enter a number, a user presses the number bar at the top of the keyboard at the same time as the other keys, much like the Shift key on a QWERTY-based keyboard. The illustration shows which lettered keys correspond to which digits. Numbers can be chorded, just as letters can. They read from left to right across the keyboard. It is possible to write 137 in one stroke by pressing the number bar along with SP P, but it takes three separate strokes to write 731. Many court reporters and stenocaptioners write out numbers phonetically instead of using the number bar.

There are various rule sets, known as &quot;theories&quot;, to combine letters to make different sounds; different court reporters use different theories in their work. Historically, reporters often created &quot;briefs&quot; (abbreviations) on-the-fly, and sometimes mixed theories, which could make it difficult for one reporter to read another reporter&#x27;s notes, but current versions of theories are primarily designed for computerized translation using a standardized dictionary provided by the company that promulgates the theory, which forces reporters to stick with one theory and use only the specific combinations in that company&#x27;s dictionary. However, it is not uncommon for students and reporters to add a significant number of entries to a stock dictionary, usually when creating briefs of their own.

Some court reporters use &quot;scopists&quot; to translate and edit their work. A scopist is a person who is trained in the phonetic writing system, English punctuation, and usually in legal formatting. They are especially helpful when court reporters are working so much that they do not have time to edit their own work. Both scopists and proofreaders work closely with court reporters to ensure an accurate transcript. The widespread use of realtime translation of the strokes has increased the demand for scopists to work simultaneously with the court reporter. With transcripts produced on computer-aided transcription (CAT) software, a scopist no longer needs to have any knowledge of shorthand theories, because the software converts shorthand to text in real time via a dictionary. However, it may still be helpful in some situations while scoping, as misstroked words may not translate and would appear in steno. Depending on availability of scopists and proofreaders, court reporters may use a scopist only to clean up a rough draft of their transcript, then proofread and certify the transcript themselves, or they may use neither and produce a final transcript by themselves, though this is a very time-consuming practice.

=== Steno paper ===
Steno paper has become almost obsolete with the advancement in paperless stenotype machines. When it is used, steno paper comes out of a stenotype machine at the rate of one row per chord, with the pressed letters printed out in 22 columns corresponding to the 22 keys, in the following order:

: STKPWHRAO*EUFRPBLGTSDZ

=== Chords ===
This is a basic chart of the letters of this machine. There are, however, different writing theories that represent some letters or sounds differently (e.g., the *F for final &quot;v&quot; in the chart below), and each court reporter develops personalized &quot;briefs&quot; and codes.

== Example ==
The following example shows how steno paper coming out of the machine represents an English sentence. Notice that key combinations can have different meanings depending on context. In the first stroke of the word &quot;example&quot;, the PL combination refers to &quot;m&quot;. In the second stroke of the word, that same key combination refers to the two letters &quot;pl&quot;.

Many words have been abbreviated: &quot;this&quot;, &quot;of&quot; and &quot;from&quot; are chorded as &quot;th&quot;, &quot;f&quot; and &quot;fr&quot;, and &quot;machine&quot; and &quot;shorthand&quot; become &quot;mn&quot; and &quot;shand&quot; respectively.

== Canada ==
There is one NCRA-approved school in all of Canada that teaches stenotype: the captioning and court reporting program at NAIT (Northern Alberta Institute of Technology). This program uses the STKPWHRAO*EUFRPBLGTSDZ keyboard layout. Graduates are trained to be court reporters, broadcast captioners, or CART providers and report a median income of $70,000 CAD between 2017 and 2020.

== Other systems ==
=== English ===
In addition to the above American Stenotype layout of STKPWHRAO*EUFRPBLGTSDZ used internationally (Ward Stone Ireland 1913), there is also a Possum Palantype system still being used in the UK.

=== Italian ===
Two Stenotype layouts are in use for the Italian language: Michela and Melani. The former is in use by the Italian senate.

=== Korean ===

The main stenotype systems in Korea are CAS and Sorizava.

=== Other languages ===
* The Portuguese language has two stenotype systems. The Brazilian system uses the same layout as the American English one.
* The Japanese language uses a StenoWord system with ten remapped keys or a more conventional Sokutaipu system.
* As with the Korean language, Chinese stenotype layouts depend on the manufacturer, four of which are most commonly encountered in the market. A combination of chording and abbreviation is used.

<doc id="513337" wikidata="Q1625437" url="?curid=513337" title="Waterfront station (Vancouver)">
<text>Waterfront station is a major intermodal public transportation facility and the main transit terminus in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is on West Cordova Street in Downtown Vancouver, between Granville and Seymour Street. The station is also accessible via two other street-level entrances, one on Howe Street to the west for direct access to the Expo Line and another on Granville Street to the south for direct access to the Canada Line.

The station is within walking distance of Vancouver&#x27;s historical Gastown district, Canada Place, Vancouver Convention Centre, Harbour Centre, Sinclair Centre, and the Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre float plane terminal. A heliport operated by Helijet, along with the downtown campuses for Simon Fraser University and the British Columbia Institute of Technology, are also located within the vicinity of the station.

==History==

Waterfront station was built by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and opened on August 1, 1914. It was the Pacific terminus for the CPR&#x27;s transcontinental passenger trains to Montreal, Quebec, and Toronto, Ontario. The current station is the third CPR station. The previous CPR station was located one block west, at the foot of Granville and, unlike the current classical-styled Waterfront station, was built in &quot;railway gothic&quot; like the CPR&#x27;s many railway hotels.

In 1978, when Via Rail took over the passenger operations of the CPR and the Canadian National Railway, it continued using both railways&#x27; stations in Vancouver, but a year later, Via consolidated its Vancouver operations at Pacific Central Station, the CN station near False Creek, and ceased using the CPR station. The last scheduled Via passenger train to use Waterfront station departed on October 27, 1979.

Waterfront station&#x27;s transformation into a public intermodal transit facility began in 1977. That year, the SeaBus began operating out of a purpose-built floating pier that was connected to the main terminal building via an overhead walkway above the CPR tracks. The CPR&#x27;s passenger platform and some of its tracks were torn up in the early 1980s to make way for the guideway of the original SkyTrain line (Expo Line), which opened on December 11, 1985. During Expo 86, SkyTrain operated special shuttle trains between Waterfront station and Stadium–Chinatown station (then named Stadium station), connecting the Canadian Pavilion at Canada Place to the main Expo site along False Creek.

A private ferry company, Royal SeaLink Express, ran passenger ferries from a new dock on the west side of the SeaBus terminal to Victoria and Nanaimo in the early 1990s, but ultimately folded. In 2003, HarbourLynx began operating out of Royal Sealink&#x27;s old facility at the SeaBus terminal. In 2006, following major engine problems with their only vessel, they folded as well.

In 1995, platforms were built adjacent to the SkyTrain station for the West Coast Express, which uses the existing CPKC tracks. The platforms for the West Coast Express were built in the same location as the old CPR platforms.

In 2002, Millennium Line trains began to share tracks with the Expo Line at Waterfront station. The lines continued to share tracks until late 2016, when an Expo Line branch to Production Way–University station was created in replacement of the Millennium Line service between VCC–Clark and Waterfront stations.

In 2009, the Canada Line opened with separate platforms which are accessible via the main station building, but require leaving the fare-paid zone when transferring between other modes. Waterfront station serves as a common terminus point for both the Expo Line and the Canada Line.

Waterfront station was one of the first stations to receive TransLink&#x27;s &quot;T&quot; signage, denoting a transit station. This signage was originally installed in the downtown core of Vancouver to help visitors during the 2010 Olympics.

In 2018, TransLink announced that Waterfront&#x27;s Canada Line platforms, as well as two other stations on the line within downtown Vancouver, would receive an accessibility upgrade including additional escalators, as most Canada Line stations were built with only up-escalators initially. Construction began in early 2019 and was completed in December.

In 2020, TransLink started work on replacing the escalators connecting to the Expo Line. The first step in this project was to close access to the Expo Line from Cordova Street for three weeks in June. The closure forced passengers to access the Expo Line from the Howe Street entrance. Because the construction blocked access to the elevators to the Expo Line platforms, a temporary shuttle bus service between the SeaBus terminal, the main concourse area, and Burrard station was instated.

In 2022, TransLink relocated the in-person service centre at Stadium–Chinatown station and opened a new customer service centre at Waterfront station on September 23.

==Architecture==

Waterfront&#x27;s main station building was designed in a neoclassical style, with a symmetrical red-brick facade dominated by a row of smooth, white Ionic order columns. The Ionic columns are repeated in the grand interior hall, flanking the perimeter of the space. The main hall features two large clocks facing each other high on the east and west walls. Paintings depicting various scenic Canadian landscapes, completed in 1916 by Adelaide Langford, line the walls above the columns. The Montreal architecture firm Barott, Blackader and Webster was responsible for designing the main station building.

The station building is owned by Cadillac Fairview and underwent renovations in 2015 to restore its brick facade.

<text>Lais of Corinth () (fl. 425 BC) was a famous hetaira or courtesan of ancient Greece, who was probably born in Corinth. She shared a name with the younger hetaira Lais of Hyccara; as ancient authors (in their usually indirect accounts) often confused them or did not indicate which one they referred to, the two women became inextricably linked. Lais lived during the Peloponnesian War and was said to be the most beautiful woman of her time. Among her clients were the philosopher Aristippus (two of his alleged writings were about Lais), Demosthenes, and the Olympic champion Eubotas of Cyrene.

Aelian relates a tradition that either she or the other Lais held the nickname &quot;Axine&quot; (&quot;axehead&quot;), for the sharpness of her cruelty. Anne Robertson noted that Corinth was in antiquity famous for its supposed thousand temple prostitutes, including Lais, and that the city&#x27;s reputation “added a new word to the Greek language: &quot;korinthiazesthai&quot;, &quot;to live like a Corinthian&quot; - a life of wealthy, drunken debauchery.”

Lais was depicted in a euhumerizing late-1520 portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger.

<text>The &#x27; (; FAZ; &quot;Frankfurt General Newspaper&quot;) is a German newspaper founded in 1949. It is published daily in Frankfurt and is considered a newspaper of record for Germany. Its Sunday edition is the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung (; FAS&quot;&quot;&#x27;).

The paper runs its own network of correspondents. Its editorial policy is not determined by a single editor, but cooperatively by four editors.

==History==

The first edition of the &quot;FAZ&quot; appeared on 1 November 1949; its founding editors were Hans Baumgarten, Erich Dombrowski, Karl Korn, Paul Sethe and Erich Welter. Welter acted as editor until 1980. Some editors had worked for the moderate &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;, which had been banned in 1943. However, in their first issue, the &quot;FAZ&quot; editorial expressly refuted the notion of being the earlier paper&#x27;s successor, or of continuing its legacy:
 
Until 30 September 1950, the &quot;FAZ&quot; was printed in Mainz.

Traditionally, many of the headlines in the &quot;FAZ&quot; were styled in blackletter format, and no photographs appeared on the title page. Some of the rare exceptions were a picture of celebrating people in front of the Berlin Reichstag on 4 October 1990 (German Unity Day), and two pictures in the edition on 12 September 2001 (one day after the September 11 attacks) showing the collapsing World Trade Center and American president George W. Bush.

In the early 2000s, &quot;FAZ&quot; expanded aggressively, with customized sections for Berlin and Munich. An eight-page six-day-a-week English-language edition was distributed as an insert in &quot;The International Herald Tribune&quot; (which is owned by The New York Times Company); the articles were selected and translated from the same day&#x27;s edition of the parent newspaper by the &quot;FAZ&quot; staff in Frankfurt. However, FAZ group suffered a loss of 60.6 million euros in 2002. By 2004, the customized sections were scrapped. The English edition shrank to a tabloid published once a week.

On 5 October 2007, the &quot;FAZ&quot; altered its traditional layout to include color photographs on the front page, and replaced blackletter typeface outside the nameplate. Due to its traditionally layout, the introduction of color photographs was controversially discussed by &quot;FAZ&quot; readers, becoming the subject of a 2009 comedy film.

Currently, the &quot;FAZ&quot; is produced electronically using the IBM Networked Interactive Content Access (NICA) software and Unisys Hermes. For its characteristic comment headings, a digital Fraktur font was ordered. This font has since been abandoned, due to the above-mentioned change of layout.

After introducing the new spelling prescribed by German orthography reform of 1996 on 1 August 1999, the paper returned to the old spelling exactly one year later, declaring that the reform had failed to achieve its primary goals of improving language mastery and strengthening the unity of the language. After several changes had been made to the new spelling, &quot;FAZ&quot; accepted it and started using it (in a custom version) on 1 January 2007.

In December 1999, future German Chancellor Angela Merkel published an article in the , lamenting the &quot;tragedy&quot; that had befallen the party (CDU donations scandal), blaming former Chancellor Helmut Kohl and urging a new course.

==Orientation==

Its political orientation is liberal-conservative, occasionally providing a forum to commentators with different opinions.

In the 2013 elections the paper endorsed the CDU/CSU alliance.

==Ownership==
The company has the legal form of a GmbH (company with limited liability); the independent (Fazit-Foundation) is its majority shareholder, holding 93.7% of shares. The FAZIT-Stiftung was created in 1959 by the transformation of the then &quot;FAZ&quot; owner into a private foundation. It is &#x27;owned&#x27; by up to nine persons who can&#x27;t sell or buy their share but have to transmit it free of charge to a successor which is co-opted by the remaining shareholders. The foundations statute prescribes that only such persons shall be co-opted as new member, who &quot;by their standing and personality&quot; can guarantee the &quot;independence&quot; of the &quot;FAZ&quot;. The current group of seven is composed of active or former CEOs, company owners, board members, and corporate lawyers. The foundation also owns more than 90% of the shares of the company &#x27;Frankfurter Societät&#x27; which in turn is owner of the printing enterprise &#x27;Frankfurter Societätsdruckerei&#x27; and the regional paper Frankfurter Neue Presse.

==Circulation==

The &quot;F.A.Z.&quot; is one of several high-profile national newspapers in Germany (along with &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;, &quot;Die Welt&quot;, , &quot;Frankfurter Rundschau&quot; and &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot;). In 2011, it counted 40 foreign correspondents among its staff.

The 1993 circulation of the paper was 391,013 copies. In 2001, it had a circulation of 409,000 copies. The 2007 circulation of the daily edition was 382,499 copies. The 2016 (IVW II/2016) circulation of the daily edition was 256,188 copies.

==Bans==
In 2006, the &quot;FAZ&quot; was banned in Egypt for publishing articles which were deemed as &quot;insulting Islam&quot;. In February 2008, the paper was again banned in Egypt due to the publication of cartoons depicting Muhammad.

In November 2012, the paper provoked strong criticism in Spain because of its stance against Spanish immigration to Germany during the economic crisis.

In July 2019, the &quot;FAZ&quot; website, along with other major German media, including Spiegel Online, was blocked by China&#x27;s Great Firewall. The reasons for the ban remain unclear, but &quot;FAZ&quot; believed it was possibly due to its reporting on the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests.

<text>Steven Glenwood MacLean (born December 14, 1954) is a retired Canadian astronaut. He was the president of the Canadian Space Agency, from September 1, 2008, to February 1, 2013.

He was born in Ottawa, Ontario, and is married to Nadine Wielgopolski of Hull, Quebec. They have three children. He enjoys hiking, canoeing, flying, parachuting and gymnastics. In 2013 he returned to physics research as an associate member of the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) at the University of Waterloo.

==Personal life==
MacLean attended Merivale High School in Nepean, Ontario. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in physics in 1977 and a doctorate in physics in 1983 from York University in Toronto. In 1977, he received the President&#x27;s Award at York University (Murray G. Ross Award). He is a recipient of a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council post graduate scholarship in 1980, two Ontario graduate scholarships, one in 1981 and the other in 1982, and a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council postdoctoral fellowship in 1983.

He is an honorary fellow of Norman Bethune College at York University and president of the board of directors for the Mont Megantic Observatory project.

From 1974 to 1976, MacLean worked in sports administration and public relations at York University. From 1976 to 1977, he was a member of the Canadian National Gymnastics Team. He taught part-time at York University from 1980 to 1983. In 1983, he became a visiting scholar at Stanford University under Nobel Prize laureate Arthur Leonard Schawlow. He is a laser-physicist, and his research has included work on electro-optics, laser-induced fluorescence of particles and crystals and multi-photon laser spectroscopy.
From October 22 to November 1, 1992, MacLean flew onboard Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; as a payload specialist for Mission STS-52. During this mission, he performed a set of seven experiments known as CANEX-2, which included an evaluation of the Space Vision System.

MacLean served as a mission specialist on STS-115, which launched on September 9, 2006, and returned on September 21, 2006. He became the first Canadian to operate the robotic arm Canadarm2. On September 13, he performed his first spacewalk, a 7-hour EVA to activate the solar panels on the P3/4 truss – the second Canadian to do so, after Chris Hadfield.

==Honours==
In 1994, he received an honorary doctorate from the Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean in Quebec, York University, Acadia University in Wolfville, Nova Scotia. In September 2006, Steve MacLean Public School was opened in Ottawa, named after him. In 2010 he visited the school on the occasion of the principal&#x27;s retirement.
MacLean was chosen as one of the first six astronauts in December 1983. He began to do training in February 1984. From 1987 to 1993 MacLean worked as a program manager for CSVS. MacLean was the chief science advisor for the International Space Station from 1993 to 1994. He was also program manager for the Advanced Space Vision System in 1987 to 1993. MacLean is an honorary Fellow of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society.

<text>A sugarloaf was the usual form in which refined sugar was produced and sold until the late 19th century, when granulated and cube sugars were introduced. A tall cone with a rounded top was the end product of a process in which dark molasses, a rich raw sugar that was imported from sugar-growing regions such as the Caribbean and Brazil, was refined into white sugar.

==History==
The earliest record to date appears to be 12th century in Jordan, though reference to a cone of sugar is found in al-Zubayr ibn Bakkar&#x27;s 9th century Arabic &quot;Al-Akhbar al-Muwaffaqiyyat&quot;. In Europe, they were made in Italy from 1470, Belgium from 1508, England from 1544, the Netherlands from 1566, Germany from 1573, and France from 1613. When refining from sugar beet began in mainland Europe in 1799, loaves were produced in the same way.

Until the mid-19th century, the British government used a system of punitive taxes to make it impossible for its colonial producers in the Caribbean to refine their own sugar and supply Britain with finished sugarloaves. Previously, the Amsterdam industry had been similarly protected from the importation of East India white sugar. Instead, a dark raw sugar or muscovado, produced on the plantations by initial boilings of the fresh cane juice, was shipped in hogsheads to Europe on what was the third leg of the triangular trade.

The sugarloaf was also the sign of a grocer, often found outside his premises or in the window, and sometimes found on his trade tokens.

==Process==
The raw sugar was refined by a series of boiling and filtering processes. After the final boiling, it was considered ready for granulation and was poured into a large number of inverted conical molds. These were usually made of either brown earthenware or sheet iron with an internal treatment of slip or paint respectively, and each stood in its own collecting pot. Over the next few days most of the dark syrup and noncrystalline matter drained through a small hole in the bottom of the mould into the collecting pot. To improve the whiteness of the sugar, repeated applications of either a solution of white clay or of loaf sugar dissolved in warm water was applied to the broad end of the loaf. This slowly drained through the loaf, readily uniting with any remaining molasses or other coloring matter and removing it to the collecting pot. The loaves were then tapped out of the molds, dried in a store room containing hundreds of loaves, trimmed to their final shape and wrapped, usually in blue paper to enhance their white appearance.

Before use, a sugarloaf had to be cut into smaller pieces using various implements: sugar axes, sugar hammers, sugar nips, sugar choppers, sugar scrapers, etc.
See for more.

==Grades==
The molds, and so the sugarloaves, varied in size considerably: the larger the loaf the lower the grade of sugar. The grade determined the price, though loaves were sold by weight and the sugar refiner was taxed on the weight of sugar sold. When a new batch of raw sugar was refined, the best sugar came from the first boiling. After that, the waste and trimmings from the first boiling were returned to the beginning of the process and mixed with further raw sugar for the second boiling, and, as this was repeated to the end of the batch, subsequent boilings reduced slightly in quality. The finest of the loaves—maybe in diameter and high—were extremely expensive owing to the prolonged repeating of the whitening process, as were the somewhat larger double refined loaves from the first few boilings. Lower grades of sugar were more difficult to crystallize and so larger molds were used—usually in diameter and up to about high—with loaves weighing up to . The lowest standard refined grades were called bastards, though an even lower grade was often produced from the filtration scums, usually by a scum-boiler at his own separate premises.

==Contemporary availability==
While mostly superseded by granulated and cube sugar, sugarloaves are still produced in some countries. In Iran, for instance, sugarloaves, (کله‌قند in Persian), are commonly available and regularly consumed. They are particularly common in Germany, where small loaves are a required ingredient for the Christmas season drink &quot;Feuerzangenbowle&quot;.

<text>TPC Sugarloaf is a 27-hole private golf club in the southeastern United States, located within the gated community at Sugarloaf Country Club outside the official city limits of Duluth, Georgia, a suburb northeast of Atlanta.

The facility consists of three 9-hole courses designed by Greg Norman, and is a member of the Tournament Players Club network operated by the PGA Tour. It was the home of the tour&#x27;s annual AT&amp;T Classic (formerly the BellSouth Classic) from 1997 until it ended in 2008. It began hosting the Mitsubishi Electric Classic (formerly the Greater Gwinnett Championship) on the PGA Tour Champions in 2013. In 2020, it held the LocaliQ Series Tour Championship, which served as the pandemic replacement for the PGA Tour Canada in the 2020 season.

The BellSouth/AT&amp;T Classic was always played over the original two nines, The Stables and The Meadows, which opened the week before its first staging of the tournament in 1997. Just weeks beforehand, the property was hit by a tornado which damaged many trees on the first and ninth holes, and leveled some of the corporate tent structures around the 18th green. The third nine, The Pines, opened in 2000.

The land was formerly the O. Wayne Rollins family farm, where they kept pure-bred cattle and horses.

<text>W. Thomas Smith Jr. (born April 30, 1959) is an American author, editor, and journalist. He has written several books. His articles have appeared in many newspapers and magazines.
Smith is executive editor of &quot;World Defense Review&quot;, a columnist with Townhall.com, and a former contributor to &quot;National Review Online.&quot;

==Education and military service==

Smith graduated from the University of South Carolina Columbia in 1982 with a BA degree in history. He then served in the U.S. Marine Corps as an infantry leader, parachutist, and shipboard special weapons security and counterterrorism instructor. Following his service in the Corps in 1987, he served on a para-military SWAT team in the nuclear industry. Soon thereafter, he began his career as a journalist.
==Career==

Smith has written for numerous publications, including &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;, &quot;The New York Post&quot;, and the UK&#x27;s &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In 1998, he co-authored a &quot;George&quot; magazine feature with John F. Kennedy Jr. (Smith interviewed Gen. William C. Westmoreland in Charleston, South Carolina – Kennedy interviewed Gen. Võ Nguyên Giáp in Vietnam). The interviews were published together as a single piece on the Vietnam War in the November 1998 issue of &quot;George&quot;.

As a war correspondent, Smith reported from battlefields in both the Balkans in 1995 and in the Middle East in 1997, and he covered the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks from ground zero in New York. Also during the 1990s, he worked as a business magazine editor, a contract media relations director, a publicist for NBA basketball player Vince Carter and other professional athletes, and was the sole columnist for head football coach Lou Holtz&#x27;s official website during Holtz&#x27;s inaugural season at USC.

Smith&#x27;s first book, &quot;Encyclopedia of the Central Intelligence Agency&quot;, was published in 2003. He has since written five other books.

Smith has been a guest commentator on the Fox News Channel, E! Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;True Hollywood Story&quot;, and Bill Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Morning in America&quot;. He has also been interviewed by numerous national publications (including &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;Writer&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;The Writer&quot;, and others); NBC, CBS, and ABC television affiliates; and he is a frequent guest on nationally syndicated radio programs, National Public Radio (NPR), and international radio, including the BBC. His articles have been included numerous times in radio-host Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s daily &quot;stack of stuff.&quot;

Smith is a contributing writer for &quot;A Nation Changed&quot;, a book commemorating the first anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks (published by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;). He is the technical editor and foreword writer for the second edition of &quot;The Complete Idiot&#x27;s Guide to Understanding Iraq&quot; by Joseph Tragert, and he is the technical editor and &quot;special afterword&quot; writer for &quot;Contract Warriors&quot; by Fred Rosen.

He has served as adjunct professor at USC&#x27;s College of Journalism and Mass Communications, and he has lectured groups and conferences from Fortune 500 companies to the U.S. Armed Forces.

A former correspondent for &#x27;Agencia EFE&#x27; (the world&#x27;s largest Spanish-language news wire), Smith currently writes a column, &#x27;Beyond the DropZone&#x27;, for – and is executive editor of – &quot;World Defense Review&quot;. He is a columnist for &quot;Townhall.com&quot;, and an erstwhile contributor to &quot;National Review Online&quot;. Some of his stories have been picked up by the &quot;Scripps Howard News&quot; wire. Others have been re-published by the U.S. Department of Defense. He also writes for &quot;Family Security Matters&quot; and is the director of their Counterterrorism Research Center.

==Beirut controversy==
In November 2007, Smith became the subject of controversy for blog posts he wrote as a freelancer for &quot;The Tank&quot;, a section of &quot;National Review Online&quot; (&quot;NRO&quot;). On September 25, 2007, Smith reported that some 200-plus heavily armed Hezbollah militiamen were occupying a sprawling Hezbollah tent city close to the Lebanese parliament. Four days later, he blogged that between 4,000 and 5,000 Hezbollah gunmen deployed to the Christian areas of Beirut in an unsettling show of force.

&quot;The Huffington Post&quot; published a story alleging that Smith exaggerated or made up two events. In response, Smith said he had only failed to be &quot;specific in terms of detailing his sourcing.&quot;

After an internal &quot;NRO&quot; investigation, Smith&#x27;s editors declared that &quot;NRO&quot; could not stand by the blogging because both reports were disputed as implausible by sources independent of Smith. On December 7, 2007, Smith voluntarily ended his relationship as a freelancer with &quot;NRO&quot;, saying this would be &quot;in the best interest of the publication.&quot;

<text>The Mausoleum of Tangun is an ancient burial site in Kangdong near Pyongyang, North Korea. It is claimed by North Korea to be the tomb of Tangun, legendary founder of Gojoseon, the first Korean kingdom.

A pyramid was built on top of the grave in 1994, consisting of 1994 blocks of stone. The complex occupies about 1.8 km² (.70 mi²) on the slope of Mount Taebak (대박산). The complex is divided into three major sections: restoration work area, stone statue area, and the burial site. Dangun&#x27;s grave is shaped like a step pyramid, about 22 m (72 ft) high and 50 m (164 ft) on each side.

According to the Samguk Yusa, Gojoseon was thought to have been founded in 2333 BCE. North Koreans claim that their current excavations have dramatically changed the estimates of North Korean historians back to at least 3000 BCE, making the site c.5011 years old (±267 years in 1993).

==Background==
North Korea&#x27;s leader Kim Il Sung insisted that Dangun was not merely a legend but a real historical person. As consequence, North Korean archaeologists were compelled to locate the purported remains and grave of Dangun. In the October of 1993, through the thesis called the &quot;Excavation reports of the mausoleum of Dangun(단군릉발굴보고)&quot;, North Korean academia announced that 86 human bone remains were found that can be traced to two individuals, one man and the other woman, and by dating the bone of the man using the method of electron spin resonance dating, it was found to be from more than 5011 years ago.

==Controversy==

A nail found in the mausoleum, dating to the Goguryeo period (37 BCE-668 CE), has been the subject of much controversy. This discovery has thus led some North Korean historians to conclude that the mausoleum was discovered and renovated during that period. Many observers and historians outside of North Korea, including South Korea, consider the data and the interpretation compromised by politics and nationalism. North Korea has permitted no independent testing to resolve the questions over authenticity and dating. South Korean historians think it&#x27;s more likely to be a tomb of a regional power during the Goguryeo kingdom based on the artifacts found at the site.

<text>Werner Finck (2 May 1902 – 31 July 1978) was a German &quot;Kabarett&quot; comedian, actor and author. Not politically motivated by his own admission but just a &quot;convinced individualist&quot;, he became one of Germany&#x27;s leading cabaret artists under the conditions of the Nazi suppression after 1933.

==Biography==

Born in Görlitz in Prussian Silesia, the son of a pharmacist, Finck attended an art school in Dresden and began his career as an itinerant storyteller of fairy tales in the 1920s. He took acting lessons and began a mediocre tenure in the theatre, making his debut in Silesian Bunzlau (present-day Bolesławiec, Poland). However, it became obvious that he had &quot;comic bones&quot; and when he met a friend who had contacts in the Berlin &quot;Kabarett&quot; scene, he found his true calling.

Together with artists like Hans Deppe, Rudolf Platte and Robert A. Stemmle he founded the cabaret &quot;Die Katakombe&quot; with some friends in 1929. Finck acted as conferencier, and the cabaret became successful because of his critical and subtly impudent remarks against the Nazis, proving to be an early thorn in their side. Finck had an ability to be seemingly lost for words when saying something and the audience, playing along, finished his sentences. He often defied authority by daring Gestapo informers in the audience to write down every word he said. According to an anecdote, Finck once confronted an officer asking with seeming innocence, &quot;Am I talking too fast? Can you follow me or shall I follow you?&quot;

According to his later accounts, Finck was confronted with politics for the very first time: &quot;If only I had known that all these people were just &quot;Mitläufer&quot;. Some even camouflaged as &quot;Gauleiter&quot;. (...) So quite a few people claim I had disapproved of the Nazis. I would like to point out that these are defamations. You never know. (...) I must admit though that the Nazis disapproved of me.&quot; The way Finck presented his jokes made it very difficult for authorities to nail him down. His exploits made him a legend in his lifetime, to such an extent that when he introduced himself to British and American journalists after the war, he was met with disbelief as they believed that the &quot;Werner Finck&quot; who joked against the Nazis was a fairy-tale figure.

However, the &quot;Katakombe&quot; was closed on 10 May 1935 on the orders of Minister Joseph Goebbels. Finck and his colleagues were interned for six weeks in Esterwegen concentration camp, where he met Carl von Ossietzky and Julius Leber. The &quot;Katakombe&quot; ensemble took their arrest in good stride, because they still performed despite their imprisonment. They reasoned that before the cabaret closed down they had performed with anxiety due to the fear of incarceration; now they did not need to fear because they were already imprisoned. It was due to the intervention of his friend, actress Käthe Dorsch, who talked to Goebbels&#x27; rival Hermann Göring, that Finck was released on 1 July on condition that he not work in public for a year.

Despite this he continued performing before live audiences from 1937 onwards, as well as in film, where he had a successful, if undistinguished, career from 1931. However, he was banned from the &quot;Reichskulturkammer&quot; in 1939 and, threatened with arrest again, he joined the Wehrmacht armed forces in the rank of a private radiotelephone operator to avoid imprisonment. A member of the 23rd Infantry Division, he was awarded the Iron Cross, 2nd class and the Eastern Front Medal, which he called &quot;Frozen Meat Medal&quot; (&quot;Gefrierfleischorden&quot;).

He temporarily served as a troop entertainer and later used his World War II exploits in a cabaret programme entitled &quot;Der brave Soldat schweigt&quot; (&quot;The Good Soldier Shuts Up&quot; – a pun on Jaroslav Hašek&#x27;s &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot;). He witnessed the German surrender as a POW of the U.S. Army in Bad Aibling, Bavaria.

From 1945-49, Finck, with Hans Bayer (&quot;Thaddäus Troll&quot;), issued the journal &quot;Das Wespennest&quot; (&quot;The Hornets&#x27; Nest&quot;), the first German satirical magazine after the war. He resumed his career in cabaret, performing at the &quot;Schmunzelkolleg&quot; (&quot;Chuckle College&quot;) in Munich and founding the &quot;Nebelhorn&quot; (&quot;Foghorn&quot;) cabaret in Zürich (1947), as well as the &quot;Mausefalle&quot; (&quot;Mousetrap&quot;) in Stuttgart (1948). In 1950 he established the joke political party of the &quot;Radical Centre&quot; in West Berlin. Finck was able to continue his film career, including the role for which he is most known today, in Fassbinder&#x27;s TV series &quot;Eight Hours Don&#x27;t Make a Day&quot; in 1972; he played Gregor, the doddering but gentle old lover of the miniseries protagonist&#x27;s grandmother. He remained active in live performances, notably going on tour in the United States in 1968.

==Death==
Finck died in Munich, aged 76, where he is buried in the Waldfriedhof cemetery. The inscription on his tombstone reads: &quot;You are still here and I passed away, soon you are there where I am today.&quot;

<text>A wafer is a crisp, often sweet, very thin, flat, light biscuit, often used to decorate ice cream, and also used as a garnish on some sweet dishes. They frequently have a waffle surface pattern but may also be patterned with insignia of the food&#x27;s manufacturer or may be patternless. Some chocolate bars, such as Kit Kat and Coffee Crisp, are wafers with chocolate in and around them.

==Communion wafers==

A communion wafer is a type of unleavened bread consumed as part of the Christian ritual of communion.

==Spa wafer==

Special &quot;spa wafers&quot; (Czech: &quot;lázeňské oplatky&quot;, Slovak: &quot;kúpeľné oblátky&quot;) are produced in the spa towns of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic (e.g. Piešťany). The production of the wafers in Karlsbad and Marienbad was traditional to the towns&#x27; German-speaking population, who, after the ethnic cleansing of the area, brought the craft to Germany.

A similar biscuit is cooked in Hungary called the Molnárkalács. Its origins can be traced back to the Palóc population. It is round and hard (sometimes also rolled) decorated with folk symbols and images and text instead of a simple spiral. It is also eaten with toppings like jams. It is made with special pressing tool, the &quot;sütővas&quot;.

==Christmas wafer==
Christmas wafers are made of only wheat flour and water. Their patterns often depict religious scenes, are a Central European Roman Catholic Christmas tradition celebrated in Polish, Slovak, Lithuanian and Italian families on Christmas Eve. These do not have sacramental value like the communion wafer. Christmas wafers are symbolic bread to share among guests to emphasize the close relationship by eating bread together. This gesture has a positive meaning, but additional wishes are often made as well. They are called &quot;opłatek&quot; (Latin: oblatum) in Polish, as opposed to &quot;wafel&quot;, which denotes a common wafer.

==&quot;Oblea&quot;==

A variation of a wafer, considered a part of the traditional cuisine in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador, Venezuela, and Mexico, is known as an &quot;oblea&quot;. It is usually eaten as a dessert with two pieces filled with &quot;arequipe&quot;, &quot;dulce de leche&quot;, or &quot;cajeta&quot; (milk caramel), and/or condensed milk in the middle. In some places, they might contain cheese, fruits, or whipped cream, among others.

==Pink wafer==
The pink wafer is a wafer-based confectionery originally made by Edinburgh&#x27;s Crawford&#x27;s Biscuits in the United Kingdom. It is now made by United Biscuits, the company that took over the firm in 1960, still using the Crawford&#x27;s name. The snack consists of crème sandwiched between wafers (dyed pink).

There is a similar product branded Pink Panther wafers.

==&quot;Freska&quot;==
&quot;Freska&quot; ( ) is an Egyptian wafer sold only on beaches in the summertime. It is made from two thin circular wafers filled with a thin layer of honey syrup.

==Variations==

===Flavours===
Some wafers are produced with a chocolate covering. Another popular flavor is lemon. 

===Shapes===
Piroulines and Barquillos are wafers rolled into a tube, and sometimes filled with cream.

<doc id="513402" wikidata="Q47780" url="?curid=513402" title="Zaha Hadid">
<text>Dame Zaha Mohammad Hadid ( &quot;Zahā Ḥadīd&quot;; 31 October 1950 – 31 March 2016) was an Iraqi and British architect, artist and designer, recognised as a key figure in architecture of the late-20th and early-21st centuries. Born in Baghdad, Iraq, Hadid studied mathematics as an undergraduate and then enrolled at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in 1972. In search of an alternative system to traditional architectural drawing, and influenced by Suprematism and the Russian avant-garde, Hadid adopted painting as a design tool and abstraction as an investigative principle to &quot;reinvestigate the aborted and untested experiments of Modernism [...] to unveil new fields of building&quot;.

She was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as the &quot;Queen of Curves&quot;, who &quot;liberated architectural geometry, giving it a whole new expressive identity&quot;. Her major works include the London Aquatics Centre for the 2012 Olympics, the Broad Art Museum, Rome&#x27;s MAXXI Museum, and the Guangzhou Opera House. Some of her awards have been presented posthumously, including the statuette for the 2017 Brit Awards. With several awards and accolades to her name, she has also been recognized by the 2013 Forbes List as one of the &quot;World&#x27;s Most Powerful Women&quot;. Several of her buildings were still under construction at the time of her death, including the Daxing International Airport in Beijing, and the Al Wakrah Stadium (now Al Janoub) in Qatar, a venue for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

Hadid was the first woman to receive the Pritzker Architecture Prize, in 2004. She received the UK&#x27;s most prestigious architectural award, the Stirling Prize, in 2010 and 2011. In 2012, she was made a Dame by Elizabeth II for services to architecture, and in February 2016, the month preceding her death, she became the first woman to be individually awarded the Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects (Ray Eames and Sheila O&#x27;Donnell had previously been awarded it jointly with Charles Eames and John Tuomey respectively).

==Early life and family==
Zaha Hadid was born on 31 October 1950 in Baghdad, Iraq, to an upper-class Iraqi family. Her father, Muhammad al-Hajj Husayn Hadid, was a wealthy industrialist from Mosul. He co-founded the socialist al-Ahali group in 1932, a significant political organisation in the 1930s and 1940s. He was the co-founder of the National Democratic Party in Iraq and served as minister of finance after the overthrow of the monarch after the 1958 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état for the government of General Abd al-Karim Qasim. Her mother, Wajiha al-Sabunji, was an artist from Mosul while her brother Foulath Hadid was a writer, accountant and expert on Arab affairs. Hadid once mentioned in an interview how her early childhood trips to the ancient Sumerian cities in southern Iraq sparked her interest in architecture. In the 1960s, Hadid attended boarding schools in England and Switzerland. Hadid was unmarried with no children.

== Career ==
Hadid studied mathematics at the American University of Beirut before moving, in 1972, to London to study at the Architectural Association School of Architecture. There she studied with Rem Koolhaas, Elia Zenghelis and Bernard Tschumi. Her former professor, Koolhaas, described her at graduation as &quot;a planet in her own orbit.&quot; Zenghelis described her as the most outstanding pupil he ever taught. &#x27;We called her the inventor of the 89 degrees. Nothing was ever at 90 degrees. She had spectacular vision. All the buildings were exploding into tiny little pieces.&quot; He recalled that she was less interested in details, such as staircases. &quot;The way she drew a staircase you would smash your head against the ceiling, and the space was reducing and reducing, and you would end up in the upper corner of the ceiling. She couldn&#x27;t care about tiny details. Her mind was on the broader pictures—when it came to the joinery she knew we could fix that later. She was right.&#x27; Her AA graduation thesis, &quot;Malevich&#x27;s Tektonik&quot;, was a concept and design for a 14-level hotel on London&#x27;s Hungerford Bridge executed as an acrylic painting, inspired by the works of the Ukrainian suprematist artist Kazimir Malevich.

After graduation in 1977, she went to work for her former professors, Koolhaas and Zenghelis, at the Office for Metropolitan Architecture, in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Through her association with Koolhaas, she met the architectural engineer Peter Rice, who gave her support and encouragement during the early stages of her career. Hadid became a naturalised citizen of the United Kingdom. She opened her own architectural firm, Zaha Hadid Architects, in London in 1980. During the early 1980s, Hadid&#x27;s style introduced audiences to a new modern architecture style through her extremely detailed and professional sketches. At the time people were focused on postmodernism designs, so her designs were a different approach to architecture that set her apart from other designers.

She then began her career teaching architecture, first at the Architectural Association, then, over the years at Harvard Graduate School of Design, Cambridge University, the University of Chicago, the Hochschule für bildende Künste in Hamburg, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Columbia University. She earned her early reputation with her lecturing and colourful and radical early designs and projects, which were widely published in architectural journals but remained largely unbuilt. Her ambitious but unbuilt projects included a plan for Peak in Hong Kong (1983), and a plan for an opera house in Cardiff, Wales, (1994). The Cardiff experience was particularly discouraging; her design was chosen as the best by the competition jury, but the Millennium Commission, acting as funding body, refused to pay for it, and the commission was given to a different and less ambitious architect. Hadid&#x27;s response to the decision was to ask &quot;Do they want nothing but mediocrity?&quot;. Her reputation in this period rested largely upon her teaching and the imaginative and colourful paintings she made of her proposed buildings. Her international reputation was greatly enhanced in 1988 when she was chosen to show her drawings and paintings as one of seven architects chosen to participate in the exhibition &quot;Deconstructivism in Architecture&quot; curated by Philip Johnson and Mark Wigley at New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art. This, a conference at the Tate in London and press coverage of her work began to not only get her name out into the architecture world, but allowed people to associate a particular style of architecture with Hadid.

==Early buildings (1991–2005)==
===Vitra Fire Station, Weil am Rhein, Germany (1991–1993)===
One of her first clients was Rolf Fehlbaum, the president-director general of the Swiss furniture firm Vitra, and later, from 2004 to 2010, a member of the jury for the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. In 1989, Fehlbaum had invited Frank Gehry, then little-known, to build a design museum at the Vitra factory in Weil-am-Rhein. In 1993, he invited Hadid to design a small fire station for the factory. Her design, made of raw concrete and glass, was a sculptural work composed of sharp diagonal forms colliding together in the centre. The design plans appeared in architecture magazines before construction. When completed, it only served as a fire station for a short period of time, as Weil am Rhein soon opened their own fire station. It became an exhibit space instead, and is now on display with the works of Gehry and other well-known architects. It was the launching pad of her architectural career.

===Bergisel Ski Jump, Innsbruck, Austria (1999–2002)===
Hadid designed a public housing estate in Berlin (1986–1993) and organised an exhibition, &quot;The Great Utopia&quot; (1992), at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. Her next major project was a ski jump at Bergisel, in Innsbruck Austria. The old ski jump, built in 1926, had been used in the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics. The new structure was to contain not only a ski jump, but also a cafe with 150 seats offering a 360-degree view of the mountains. Hadid had to fight against traditionalists and against time; the project had to be completed in one year, before the next international competition. Her design is 48 metres high and rests on a base seven metres by seven metres. She described it as &quot;an organic hybrid&quot;, a cross between a bridge and a tower, which by its form gives a sense of movement and speed.

===Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States (1997–2003)===
At the end of the 1990s, her career began to gather momentum, as she won commissions for two museums and a large industrial building. She competed against Rem Koolhaas and other well-known architects for the design of the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, Ohio (1997–2003). She won, and became the first woman to design an art museum in the United States. At 8,500 square metres, the museum was not huge, and her design did not have the flamboyance of the Guggenheim Bilbao of Frank Gehry, built at the same time. But the project demonstrated Hadid&#x27;s ability to use architectural forms to create interior drama, including its central element, a 30-metre long black stairway that passes between massive curving and angular concrete walls.

===Spittelau Viaducts Housing Project, Vienna, Austria (1994–2005)===
In 1994, Hadid was commissioned by the city of Vienna to design and construct a three-part scheme for the urban redevelopment of an area adjacent to the Danube Canal. Situated along the Spittelauer Lände, the series of buildings interact with and cross over the railway viaduct by Viennese Modernist architect Otto Wagner, a protected structure. In its initial design consisting of five buildings, the mixed-use scheme, described as a &quot;sculpture-like overbuilding&quot; of the historic Stadtbahn railway, was designed by Hadid&#x27;s practice ZHA. Hadid, together with British architectural artist Brian Clarke, developed an unexecuted collaborative proposal for the project that incorporated integral artworks by Clarke as part of the Neo-Futurist structures, with interrelated glass mosaic and traditionally-leaded stained glass forming part of the cladding and fenestration of the complex. Clarke developed a new type of mouth-blown glass for the scheme, which he christened &#x27;Zaha-Glas&#x27;. Later reduced to three buildings, the project, which experienced delays in construction, was completed in 2006, without the artwork.

===Phaeno Science Center, Wolfsburg, Germany (2000–2005)===
In 2000, she won an international competition for the Phaeno Science Center, in Wolfsburg, Germany (2002–2005). The new museum was only a little larger than the Cincinnati Museum, with 9,000 square metres of space, but the plan was much more ambitious. It was similar in concept to the buildings of Le Corbusier, raised up seven metres on concrete pylons. Unlike Corbusier&#x27;s buildings, she planned for the space under the building to be filled with activity, and each of the 10 massive inverted cone-shaped columns that hold up the building contains a cafe, a shop, or a museum entrance. The tilting columns reach up through the building and also support the roof. The museum structure resembles an enormous ship, with sloping walls and asymmetric scatterings of windows, and the interior, with its angular columns and exposed steel roof framework, gives the illusion of being inside a working vessel or laboratory.

===BMW Administration Building, Leipzig, Germany (2001–2005)===
In 2002, she won the competition to design a new administrative building for the factory of the auto manufacturer BMW in Leipzig, Germany. The three assembly buildings adjoining it were designed by other architects; her building served as the entrance and what she called the &quot;nerve centre&quot; of the complex. As with the Phaeno Science Center, the building is hoisted above street level on leaning concrete pylons. The interior contains a series of levels and floors which seem to cascade, sheltered by tilting concrete beams and a roof supported by steel beams in the shape of an &#x27;H&#x27;. The open interior inside was intended, she wrote, to avoid &quot;the traditional segregation of working groups&quot; and to show the &quot;global transparence of the internal organisation&quot; of the enterprise, and wrote that she had given particular attention to the parking lot in front of the building, with the intent, she wrote, of &quot;transforming it into a dynamic spectacle of its own&quot;.

===Ordrupgaard Museum extension, Copenhagen, Denmark (2001–2005)===
In 2001, she began another museum project, an extension of the Ordrupgaard Museum near Copenhagen, Denmark, a museum featuring a collection of 19th century French and Danish art in the 19th-century mansion of its collector. The new building is 87 metres long and 20 metres wide, and is connected by a five-metre wide passage to the old museum. There are no right angles – only diagonals – in the concrete shell of the museum. The floor-to-ceiling glass walls of the gallery make the garden the backdrop of the exhibits.

=== Pritzker Architecture Prize ===
In 2004, she won the Pritzker Architecture Prize, the most prestigious award in architecture, though she had only completed four buildings – the Vitra Fire Station, the Ski Lift in Innsbruck Austria, the Car Park and Terminus Hoenheim North in France, and the Contemporary Art Center in Cincinnati. In making the announcement, Thomas Pritzker, the head of the jury, announced: &quot;Although her body of work is relatively small, she has achieved great acclaim and her energy and ideas show even greater promise for the future.&quot;

==Major projects (2006–2010)==
===Zaragoza Bridge Pavilion, Zaragoza, Spain (2005–2008)===
Between 1997 and 2010, Hadid ventured into the engineers&#x27; domain of bridge construction, a field also occupied by other top architects including Norman Foster and Santiago Calatrava. Between 2005 and 2008, she designed and built the Bridge-Pavilion of Zaragoza, which was both an exhibit hall and a bridge, created for Expo 2008, an event on the themes of water and durable development. The concrete bridge span on which the pavilion rests is 85 metres long, as measured from the Exposition site to an island in the Ebro River. The bridge carries or is attached to four tunnel-like exhibition spaces she termed &quot;pods&quot;, which spread onto the island, for a total length of 275 metres. The pods are covered with a skin of 26,000 triangular shingles, many of which open to let in air and light. The bridge-pavilion, characteristic of her designs and buildings of the period, is composed entirely of diagonal slopes and curves, with no right-angles of orthogonal forms. By its curving shape and low profile, the bridge-pavilion fits smoothly into the grassy landscape along the river.

===Sheikh Zayed Bridge, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (1997–2010)===
Between 1997 and 2010, she constructed a much more ambitious bridge, the Sheikh Zayed Bridge, which honors Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, between the island of Abu Dhabi and the mainland of Abu Dhabi, as well as to the Abu Dhabi International Airport. Both the design of the bridge and the lighting, consisting of gradually changing colours, were designed to give the impression of movement. The silhouette of the bridge is a wave, with a principal arch 235 metres long, standing 60 metres above the water. The total span of four lanes is long, and also includes pedestrian walkways. The bridge was inaugurated on November 25, 2010, by the late UAE President Sheikh Khalifa. The ceremony was also attended by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, marking her second state visit to the UAE. Traffic on the bridge commenced three days following the opening ceremony.

===National Museum of Arts of the 21st Century (MAXXI), Rome, Italy (1998–2010)===
The National Museum of Arts of the 21st Century (MAXXI for short), in Rome, was designed and built between 1998 and 2010. The main theme of its architecture is the sense of movement; Everything in the structure seems to be moving and flowing. Hadid took inspiration from the surrounding orthogonal site grids to determine the overall form. The facade belongs to her earlier period, with smooth curving white walls and an austere black and white colour scheme. The building is perched on groups of five very thin pylons, and one gallery with a glass face precariously overhangs the plaza in front of the museum, creating shade. Rowan Moore of &quot;The Guardian&quot; of London described its form as &quot;bending oblong tubes, overlapping, intersecting and piling over each other. The imagery is of flow and movement and it resembles a demented piece of transport architecture. Inside, black steel stairs and bridges, their undersides glowing with white light, fly across a void. They take you off to the galleries, which are themselves works of frozen motion. The design is intended to generate what Hadid called &quot;confluence, interference and turbulence&quot;,

===Guangzhou Opera House, Guangzhou, China (2003–2010)===
In 2002 Hadid won an international competition for her first project in China. The Guangzhou Opera House is located in a new business district of the city, with a new 103-storey glass tower behind it. It covers 70,000 square metres and was built at cost of US$300 million. The complex comprises an 1,800-seat theatre, a multipurpose theatre, entry hall, and salon. A covered pathway with restaurants and shops separates the two main structures. This building, like several of her later buildings, was inspired by natural earth forms; the architect herself referred to it as the &quot;two pebbles&quot;. It appears akin to two giant smooth-edged boulders faced with 75,000 panels of polished granite and glass. Edwin Heathcote, writing for the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, noted Hadid&#x27;s concentration on how her design could transform the urban landscape of Guangzhou, as the building rose as the centre of the new business area. He wrote in 2011 that Hadid &quot;produced a building that seems to suck the surrounding landscape into a vortex of movement and swirling space... appears both as alien object in a landscape of incomprehensible vastness (and often overwhelming banality), and as an extrusion of the peculiar nature of this landscape.&quot; Nicolai Ourousoff, architecture critic of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, wrote that &quot;stepping into the main hall is like entering the soft insides of an oyster...The concave ceiling is pierced by thousands of little lights—it looks like you&#x27;re sitting under the dome of a clear night sky.&quot; Ourousoff noted that the finished building had construction problems: many of the granite tiles on the exterior had to be replaced, and the plaster and other interior work was poorly done by the inexperienced workers, but he praised Hadid&#x27;s ability &quot;to convey a sense of bodies in motion&quot; and called the building &quot;a Chinese gem that elevates its setting.&quot;

==Major projects (2011–2012)==
===Riverside Museum, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom (2004–2011)===
The Riverside Museum (2004–2011), on the banks of the River Clyde Glasgow, Scotland, houses the Glasgow Museum of Transport. Hadid described the 10,000-square metre building, with 7,000 square metres of gallery space, as &quot;a wave&quot;, &quot;folds in movement&quot;, and &quot;a shed in the form of a tunnel, open at the extreme ends, one end toward the city and the other toward the Clyde.&quot; Like many of her buildings, the whole form is only perceived when viewed from above. The facades are covered with zinc plates, and the roofline has a series of peaks and angles. The interior galleries caused some controversy; visitors who came to see the collection of historic automobiles found that they are mounted on the walls, high overhead, so it is impossible to look into them. Rowan Moore of &quot;The Guardian&quot; of London wrote: &quot;Obviously the space is about movement...Outside it is, typologically, a supermarket, being a big thing in a parking lot that is seeking to attract you in...It has enigma and majesty, but not friendliness.&quot;

===CMA CGM Tower, Marseille, France (2006–2011)===
Hadid&#x27;s first built tower, the CMA CGM Headquarters in Marseille, France, is most immediately notable for its dual vertical form. According to Zaha Hadid Architects, &quot;The curving profiles on the exterior facades work with the central core of the building, bringing a rigid frame and a sense of movement to this completely new typology of tower.” The 94,000-square metre building, which resembles a ship’s prow, is the highest in the town at 147 m and has a capacity of 2700 desks, an 800-seat company restaurant, a 190-seat auditorium, a maritime museum, a fitness room and training rooms.

===London Olympics Aquatics Centre, London, United Kingdom (2005–2011)===
Hadid described her Aquatics Centre for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London as &quot;inspired by the fluid geometry of water in movement&quot;. The building covers three swimming pools, and seats 17,500 spectators at the two main pools. The roof, made of steel and aluminium and covered with wood on the inside, rests on just three supports; it is in the form of a parabolic arch that dips in the centre, with the two pools at either end. The seats are placed in bays beside the curving and outward-leaning walls of glass. At £269 million, the complex cost three times the original estimate, owing principally to the complexity of the roof. This was the subject of much comment when it was constructed, and it was the first 2012 Olympic building begun but the last to be finished. It was praised by architecture critics. Rowan Moore of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that the roof &quot;floats and undulates&quot; and called the centre &quot;the Olympics&#x27; most majestic space&quot;.

=== Broad Art Museum, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, United States (2007–2012) ===
The Broad Art Museum at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, Hadid&#x27;s second project in the United States, has a space of 4,274 square metres, dedicated to contemporary art and modern art and an historical collection. The parallelogram-shaped building leans sharply and seems about to tip over. Hadid wrote that she designed the building so that its sloping pleated stainless steel facades would reflect the surrounding neighbourhood from different angles; the building continually changes colour depending upon the weather, the time of day and the angle of the sun. As Hadid commented, the building &quot;awakens curiosity without ever truly revealing its contents&quot;. Elaine Glusac of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the architecture of the new museum &quot;radicalizes the streetscape&quot;. The Museum was used in a scene of the 2016 Batman vs. Superman movie.

===Galaxy SOHO, Beijing, China (2008–2012)===
Many of Hadid&#x27;s later major works are found in Asia. The Galaxy SOHO in Beijing, China (2008–2012) is a combination of offices and a commercial centre in the heart of Beijing with a total of 332,857 square metres, composed of four different ovoid glass-capped buildings joined by multiple curving passageways on different levels. Hadid explained, &quot;the interior spaces follow the same coherent formal logic of continual curvilinearity.&quot; The complex, like most of her buildings, gives the impression that every part of them is in motion.

==Last completed major projects (2013–2016)==
===Heydar Aliyev Center, Baku, Azerbaijan (2007–2013)===
The Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku, Azerbaijan (2007–2013) is a gigantic cultural and conference centre containing three auditoriums, a library and museum, with a total space of 10,801 square metres on a surface of 15,514 square metres, and a height of 74 metres. Hadid wrote that &quot;its fluid form emerges from the folds of the natural topography of the landscape and envelops the different functions of the centre&quot;, though the building when completed was largely surrounded by Soviet-era apartment blocks. Peter Cook in &quot;Architectural Review&quot; called it &quot;a white vision, outrageously total, arrogantly complete ... a unique object that confounds and contradicts the reasonable ... a wave form sweeping up, almost lunging, into the sky ... here is architecture as the ultimate statement of theatre ... It is the most complete realisation yet of the Iraqi-born architect&#x27;s vision of sweeping curves and flowing space.&quot;

Consisting of eight storeys, the centre includes an auditorium with 1000 seats, exhibition space, conference hall, workshop and a museum. No straight line was used in the project of the complex. The shape of the building is wave-like and the overall view is unique and harmonic. Such an architectural structure stands for post-modernist architecture and forms oceanic feeling. The lines of the building symbolise the merging of past and future.

While the building itself was widely praised, Dame Zaha was criticized in many circles when she was awarded Britain&#x27;s most prestigious prize in architecture, the Design Museum &quot;Design of the Year,&quot; the first woman to do so. The building was named for the former ruler of Azerbaijan, 
Heydar Aliyev, and commissioned by his son, Illham, who became president after his father&#x27;s death in 2003. Hugh Williamson, director of Human Rights Watch for Europe and the Central Asian division, called Aliyev &quot;an authoritarian leader and so is his son.&quot; The former Soviet secret police general ruled for 30 years, first as its Communist leader and then as its president. Amnesty International accused him of human rights abuses, balloting irregularities and intimidating the opposition while in power. Several architecture critics who admired the work itself felt that Dame Zaha should have raised questions about this repressive leader even as she accepted the commission, and other critics questioned the UK granting its most prestigious architecture award to a building which memorialized a vicious Soviet dictator.

===Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Seoul, South Korea (2007–2013)===
The Dongdaemun Design Plaza (2007–2013) is among the largest buildings in Seoul, South Korea. Its name means &quot;Great Gate of the East&quot;, in reference to the old walls of the city. The complex of 86,574 square metres contains exhibition space, a museum of design, conference rooms and other common facilities, as well as the bureaux and a marketplace for designers which is open 24 hours a day. The main building is 280 metres long with seven levels, including three levels underground. The smooth-skinned, giant mushroom-like structure floating atop sloping pylons is made of concrete, aluminium, steel and stone on the exterior, and finished inside with plaster reinforced with synthetic fibre, acoustic tiles, acrylic resin, and stainless steel and polished stone on the interior. Hadid wrote that the principal characteristics of her design were &quot;transparency, porousness, and durability.&quot; It also features many ecological features, including a double skin, solar panels, and a system for recycling water.

=== Library and Learning Center, Vienna University of Economics and Business, Vienna, Austria (2008–2013) ===
The Library and Learning Center was designed as the centrepiece of the new University of Economics in Vienna. Containing 28,000 square metres of space, its distinctive Hadid features include walls sloping at 35 degrees and massive black volume cantilevered at an angle over the plaza in front of the building. She described the interior as follows: &quot;The straight lines of the building&#x27;s exterior separate as they move inward, becoming curvilinear and fluid to generate a free-formed interior canyon that serves as the principal public plaza of the Center, as well as generating corridors and bridges ensuring smooth transitions between different levels.&quot;

=== Serpentine Sackler North Gallery, Kensington Gardens, London, United Kingdom (2009–2013) ===
The Serpentine Sackler Gallery is a synthesis of two distinct parts – the 19th century classical brick structure named The Magazine (a former gunpowder store), and a 21st-century tensile structure. This is the second art space (after the MAXXI Museum in Rome) where Zaha Hadid Architects worked on the melding of both old and new elements. Zaha Hadid&#x27;s Magazine extension on the original Grade II building was aided by the reinstatement of the building to an historic arrangement as a free-standing pavilion within an enclosure, with the former courtyards covered. The North Gallery extension features Hadid&#x27;s distinct hallmark of curves, and houses a series of skylights which welcome natural light into the space as well as retractable blinds when less light is needed. Hadid also worked in collaboration with architect and heritage specialist Liam O&#x27;Connor, whose reconstructions and conversions of the original space were designed in consultation with English Heritage and Westminster City Council. The extension houses internal exhibition spaces as well as the museum shop and offices for the curatorial team.

===Innovation Tower, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China (2007–2014)===
The Innovation Tower in Hong Kong (2007–2014) is part of Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The building of 15 floors has 15,000 square metres of space, with laboratories, classrooms, studios and other facilities for 1,800 students and their faculty. It was built on the site of the university&#x27;s former football pitch. The extremely complex forms of the building required computer modelling. Early designs experimented with a facade made of reinforced plastic, textiles or aluminium, but Hadid finally settled upon metal panels with multiple layers. The building seems to lean towards the city. The floors inside are visible from the exterior like geological strata.

===Wangjing SOHO Tower, Beijing, China (2009–2014)===
Wangjing SOHO tower in Beijing is the second building Hadid designed for the major Chinese property developer, located half-way between the centre of Beijing and the airport. The towers slope and curve; Hadid compared them to Chinese fans, &quot;whose volumes turn one around the other in a complex ballet.&quot; The tallest building is 200 metres high, with two levels of shops and 37 levels of offices. A single atrium level three storeys high joins the three buildings at the base.

=== Issam Fares Institute, AUB, Beirut, Lebanon (2014) ===
The Issam Fares Institute is located in the campus of the American University of Beirut (AUB). It won the Agha Khan Award in 2016, the same year Hadid died. It has a 21 meters cantilever in order to preserve the existing landscape. The institute aims to harness, develop and initiate research of the Arab world to enhance and broaden debate on public policy and international relations. It is currently headed by Joseph Bahout

=== Nanjing International Youth Cultural Centre, Nanjing, China (2012–2015) ===
The Nanjing International Youth Cultural Centre are two skyscrapers in Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. Tower 1 is 314.5 metres (1,032 ft) tall and Tower 2 is 255 metres (837 ft). Construction began in 2012 and ended in 2015.

===Port Authority, Antwerp, Belgium (2016)===
Of all her works, Hadid designed only one government building, the Port Authority Building, or Havenhuis, in Antwerp, Belgium, completed in 2016. Most new government buildings attempt to express solidity and seriousness, but Port Authority, a ship-like structure of glass and steel on a white concrete perch, seems to have landed atop the old port building constructed in 1922. The faceted glass structure also resembles a diamond, a symbol of Antwerp&#x27;s role as the major market of diamonds in Europe. It was one of the last works of Hadid, who died in 2016, the year it opened. The square in front of the building was renamed to Zaha Hadidplein (Zaha Hadidsquare) to honor her death.

==Death==

On 31 March 2016, Hadid died of a heart attack at the age of 65 at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami, where she was being treated for bronchitis.

The statement issued by her London-based design studio announcing her death read, &quot;Zaha Hadid was widely regarded to be the greatest female architect in the world today&quot;. She is buried between her father Mohammed Hadid and brother Foulath Hadid in Brookwood Cemetery in Brookwood, Surrey, England.

In her will she left £67m, bequeathing various amounts to her business partner and family members. Her international design businesses, which accounted for the bulk of her wealth, were left in trust.

==Posthumous projects (2016–present)==
===Skyscraper proposed for Midtown Manhattan, New York City, United States (Never built)===
Skyscraper proposed for Midtown Manhattan sited at 666 Fifth Avenue. On 25 March 2017, Kam Dhillon reported a yet-to-be completed skyscraper design designed by Hadid prior to her death in 2016 in an article titled &quot;Zaha Hadid Architects Unveils Monumental Skyscraper Project for NYC&quot;.

===Salerno Harbor Station, Salerno, Italy (2000–2016)===
The first major project to be completed shortly after her death was the Salerno harbor station in Salerno, Italy, her first major transportation building. She won the competition for the building in 2000, but then the project was delayed due to funding and technical issues. Hadid scouted the site from a police boat in the harbour to visualise how it would appear from the water. The final building covers 50,000 square feet and cost 15 million Euros. Paola Cattarin, the project architect who completed the building after Hadid&#x27;s death, said, &quot;We thought of the building as an oyster, with a hard shell top and bottom, and a softer, liquid, more organic interior.&quot; At the opening of the new building, posters of Hadid were placed around the city, saying, &quot;Goodbye Zaha Hadid; Genius and Modernity, Inspiration and Transformation, Light That Takes Shape.&quot;

===520 West 28th Street, New York City, United States (2014–2017)===
520 West 28th Street, also known as the Zaha Hadid Building, is located in New York City. Designed by the architect Zaha Hadid, the building was her only residential building in New York and one of her last projects before her death.

===King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (2009–2017)===
Research and Office Complex was designed by Zaha Hadid. Hadid received the commission after a 2009 design competition. It opened in October 2017 and received a LEED Platinum certification. The complex consists of five interlocking buildings, a research center, a computer center, a conference center, a library and the Musalla, a place for prayer.

===Al-Janoub Stadium, Al Wakrah, Qatar (2014–2019)===
Al-Janoub Stadium is a retractable-roof football stadium in Al-Wakrah, Qatar that was inaugurated on 16 May 2019. This was the second of the eight stadiums inaugurated for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.

Zaha Hadid Architects stated that “The stadium was designed in conjunction with a new precinct so that it sits at the heart of an urban extension of the city, creating community-based activities in and around the stadium on non-event days.” According to the designers, it was inspired by the sails of traditional Dhow boats, used by pearl divers from the region, weaving through currents of the Persian Gulf.

===Scorpion Tower of Miami, Florida, United States (2015–2019)===
The Scorpion Tower of Miami, now known as One Thousand Museum, was started while Hadid was still alive. It is noted by its curved external columns standing the full length of the building. Its twin Scorpion Tower has also been built in Dubai.

===Beijing Daxing International Airport, China (2014–2019)===
The Beijing Daxing International Airport opened in September 2019.

===The Opus, Dubai, United Arab Emirates (2012–2019)===
The Opus designed by Zaha Hadid is a mixed-use 20 storey tower, housing residences, offices, a mix of restaurants, retail spaces and a five-star hotel. The building comprises two structures that form a single cube which appears to hover above the ground, eroded by a fluid void.

===Grand Theatre of Rabat, Rabat, Morocco (2014–2021)===
A futuristic building, faithful to the imprint of the architect, which can host the biggest cultural events of the Moroccan capital. The works, launched in October 2014 and was completed in 2021. Grand Theatre of Rabat consists of a large multipurpose room, which has 1822 seats and can accommodate different types of shows. For each artistic presentation with specific acoustics needs, the theater is equipped with adjustable systems. The theater also has a small modular room with 127 seats, a restaurant with panoramic views, shops, cafes and a bookstore.

===Mercury Tower, St. Julian&#x27;s, Malta (2016–2023)===
The Mercury Tower is the tallest building in Malta. The Tower is 122 metres (400 ft) tall, with 32 floors of mixed residential and hotel space. The most iconic feature of the building is the twisted area between levels 9 and 11 that provide its distinctive appearance. This development is one of the last concept designs signed off by Zaha Hadid personally before her death in 2016.

===Masaryčka, Prague, Czech Republic (2015–2023)===
The &quot;Masaryčka Connects&quot; project is a significant urban regeneration effort in the centre of Prague, transforming the city&#x27;s first railway station, operational since 1845, into a modern transport hub. In 2015–2016, Zaha Hadid supervised the conceptual design of a new mixed-use building that replaced a formal cargo terminal.

The construction took place in 2020–2023, as some delay was caused by negotiations with heritage protection authorities. Reflective of Hadid&#x27;s iconic style, the building integrates fluid forms and dynamic structures, intended to harmonize with Prague&#x27;s existing architectural heritage while adding a modern element to the cityscape.

The design of the buildings features vertical, fin-like elements and a curvilinear base, intended to animate the streetscape and encourage public engagement. This structure utilizes its lower two floors for retail purposes, providing a commercial zone at street level. The office levels that follow above are topped off with a rooftop garden. Upcoming developments include a direct airport line and an elevated platform above the railway tracks, interconnecting the surrounding parts of the city.

===Sky Park Residence I, II, III, IV, Bratislava, Slovakia (2016–2024)===
Four identical 31-storey residential towers measuring 105 metres (355 ft) tall, in the Sky Park complex neighbouring Bratislava city centre. Although the project was presented in 2010, the construction on the project began in December 2016. The construction of the Sky Park Residence I, II and III was completed in 2020 and the construction of the fourth residential tower started in 2021 and was completed in 2024. All four towers housing 1,048 apartments.

===KAFD Station, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (2014–2024)===
A 7-story, 20,434 sq. meter King Abdullah Financial District Metro Station in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia opened in December 2024.

===Central Bank of Iraq Tower, Baghdad, Iraq (2018–incomplete)===
In May 2010, the Central bank of Iraq (CBI) had commissioned Hadid to design the new headquarters. Although the project was presented in 2011, the construction on the project only began in late 2018 and it is scheduled to be completed in 2025. Central Bank of Iraq Tower will serve as the new headquarters for the Central bank of Iraq. It&#x27;s also features VIP entrance, visitor entrance, main lobby, museums, personnel entrance, energy center, public area, personnel facility, cash management area, data center, security center and landscaping areas.

===Sky Park Tower, Bratislava, Slovakia (2024–incomplete)===
The tower with different design then the other four identical Sky Park Residence buildings is under construction in Bratislava. The last and tallest Sky Park 33-storey residential tower with 393 apartments is set to reach a height of 119 metres (390 ft) tall in the Sky Park complex. It will be the third tallest building in Slovakia. Although the project was presented together with Sky Park Residence in 2010, the construction on the Sky Park Tower only began in 2024. With expected completion in 2027, it will be the last posthumous completed project with direct involvment of Zaha Hadid before her death.

==Teaching==
In the 1990s, she held the Sullivan Chair professorship at the University of Illinois at Chicago&#x27;s University of Illinois at Chicago College of Architecture and the Arts school of architecture. At various times, she served as guest professor at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg (HFBK Hamburg), the Knowlton School of Architecture at Ohio State University, the Masters Studio at Columbia University, and was the Eero Saarinen Visiting professor of Architectural Design at the Yale School of Architecture. In 1994, she was the Kenzo Tange Visiting Professor of Architecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. From 2000, Hadid was an o. Univ.-Prof. (Full professor) at the Institute of Architecture at the University of Applied Arts Vienna, in the Zaha Hadid Masterclass.

==Interior architecture and product design==

Hadid also undertook some high-profile interior work, including the &quot;Mind Zone&quot; at the Millennium Dome in London as well as creating fluid furniture installations within the Georgian surroundings of Home House private members club in Marylebone, and the Z.CAR hydrogen-powered, three-wheeled automobile, amongst many other designs.

In 2006, Zaha Hadid founded Zaha Hadid Design (ZHD); her eponymous design studio.

In 2007, Hadid designed Dune Formations for David Gill Gallery and the Moon System Sofa for leading Italian furniture manufacturer B&amp;B Italia.

In 2009 she worked with the clothing brand Lacoste to create a new, high fashion, and advanced boot. In the same year, she also collaborated with the brassware manufacturer Triflow Concepts to produce two new designs in her signature parametric architectural style.

In 2013, Hadid designed Liquid Glacial for David Gill Gallery which comprises a series of tables resembling ice-formations made from clear and coloured acrylic. Their design embeds surface complexity and refraction within a powerful fluid dynamic. The collection was further extended in 2015–2016. In 2016 the gallery launched Zaha&#x27;s final collection of furniture entitled UltraStellar

ZHD now operates under the lead of Co-directors Woody Yao and Maha Kutay who ensure consistency with the Founder&#x27;s ethos by continuing to coherently translate and apply Hadid&#x27;s methodological approach to any new design.

==Architectural firm==
Her architectural design firm, Zaha Hadid Architects, employs 400 people. Its headquarters from 1985 were in a Victorian former-school building in Clerkenwell, London. In 2021 they moved to Goswell Road, Clerkenwell.

Hadid established an architectural firm named Zaha Hadid Architects in New York. One of the notable buildings designed by this agency is the boutique pavilion of Il Makiage.

==Reputation==
Following her death in March 2016, Michael Kimmelman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;her soaring structures left a mark on skylines and imaginations and in the process re-shaped architecture for the modern age...Her buildings elevated uncertainty to an art, conveyed in the odd way of one entered and moved through these buildings and in the questions that her structures raised about how they were supported ... Hadid embodied, in its profligacy and promise, the era of so-called starchitects who roamed the planet in pursuit of their own creative genius, offering miracles, occasionally delivering.&quot; She is quoted as saying &quot;I don&#x27;t make nice little buildings&quot;.

Deyan Sudjic of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Hadid as &quot;an architect who first imagined, then proved, that space could work in radical new ways ... Throughout her career, she was a dedicated teacher, enthused by the energy of the young. She was not keen to be characterised as a woman architect, or an Arab architect. She was simply an architect.&quot;

In an interview published in Icon magazine, she said: &quot;I never use the issue about being a woman architect ... but if it helps younger people to know they can break through the glass ceiling, I don&#x27;t mind that.&quot; However, she admitted that she never really felt a part of the male-dominant architecture &quot;establishment&quot;. She once said &quot;As a woman in architecture you&#x27;re always an outsider. It&#x27;s OK, I like being on the edge.&#x27;

Sometimes called the &quot;Queen of the curve&quot;, Hadid was frequently described in the press as the world&#x27;s top female architect. although her work also attracted criticism. The Metropolitan Museum in New York cited her &quot;unconventional buildings that seem to defy the logic of construction&quot;. Her architectural language was described as &quot;famously extravagant&quot; and she was accused of building &quot;dictator states&quot;. Architect Sean Griffiths characterised Hadid&#x27;s work as &quot;an empty vessel that sucks in whatever ideology might be in proximity to it&quot;. 

In 2013, Hadid founded a charitable organisation, the Zaha Hadid Foundation. It became operational in 2022 to look after Hadid&#x27;s legacy and a collection of over 15,000 works by or related to Hadid, and is the only architectural foundation dedicated to a solo woman of colour. The foundation operates from buildings formerly occupied by the Design Museum at Shad Thames and Zaha Hadid Architects at Bowling Green Lane, London.

===Qatar controversy===
As the architect of a stadium to be used for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Hadid was accused in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; of giving an interview in which she allegedly showed no concern for the deaths of migrant workers in Qatar involved in the project. In August 2014, Hadid sued &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; for defamation and won. Immediately thereafter, the reviewer and author of the piece in which she was accused of showing no concern issued a retraction in which he said &quot;work did not begin on the site for the Al Wakrah stadium, until two months after Ms Hadid made those comments; and construction is not scheduled to begin until 2015 ... There have been no worker deaths on the Al Wakrah project and Ms Hadid&#x27;s comments about Qatar that I quoted in the review had nothing to do with the Al Wakrah site or any of her projects. I regret the error.&quot;

==Style==
The architectural style of Hadid is not easily categorised, and she did not describe herself as a follower of any one style or school. Nonetheless, before she had built a single major building, she was categorised by the Metropolitan Museum of Art as a major figure in architectural Deconstructivism. Her work was also described as an example of neo-futurism and parametricism. An article profiling Hadid in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazine was titled &quot;The Abstractionist&quot;.

At the time when technology was integrating into design, Zaha accepted the use of technology but still continued to hand draw her buildings and make models of the designs. This was because she did not want to limit herself and her designs to only to what the computer could do.

Through her design style, she paints the conceptual designs of her many projects in fluid and geometrical forms where &quot;Zaha Hadid&#x27;s work took shape.&quot; These would be large paintings that would aspire towards her design process and &quot;rational nature of her construction, the drawings pulled the parts and pieces apart, exploding its site and programme.&quot;

When she was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 2004, the jury chairman, Lord Rothschild, commented: &quot;At the same time as her theoretical and academic work, as a practising architect, Zaha Hadid has been unswerving in her commitment to modernism. Always inventive, she&#x27;s moved away from existing typology, from high tech, and has shifted the geometry of buildings.&quot;

The Design Museum described her work in 2016 as having &quot;the highly expressive, sweeping fluid forms of multiple perspective points and fragmented geometry that evoke the chaos and flux of modern life&quot;.

Hadid herself, who often used dense architectural jargon, could also describe the essence of her style very simply: &quot;The idea is not to have any 90-degree angles. In the beginning, there was the diagonal. The diagonal comes from the idea of the explosion which &quot;re-forms&quot; the space. This was an important discovery.&quot;

==Awards and honours==
Hadid was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2002 Birthday Honours and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to architecture.

Hadid was named an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Architects. She was on the board of trustees of The Architecture Foundation.

In 2002, Hadid won the international design competition to design Singapore&#x27;s one-north master plan. In 2004, Hadid became the first female recipient of the Pritzker Architecture Prize. In 2005, her design won the competition for the new city casino of Basel, Switzerland and she was elected as a Royal Academician. In 2006, she was honoured with a retrospective spanning her entire work at the Guggenheim Museum in New York; that year she also received an Honorary Degree from the American University of Beirut.

In 2008, she was ranked 69th on the &quot;Forbes&quot; list of &quot;The World&#x27;s 100 Most Powerful Women&quot;. In 2010, she was named by &quot;Time&quot; as an influential thinker in the 2010 TIME 100 issue. In September 2010 the &quot;New Statesman&quot; listed Zaha Hadid at number 42 in its annual survey of &quot;The World&#x27;s 50 Most Influential Figures of 2010&quot;.

In 2013, she was assessed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the UK by &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; on BBC Radio 4. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, Hadid appeared on Debrett&#x27;s list of the most influential people in the UK. In January 2015, she was nominated for the Services to Science and Engineering award at the British Muslim Awards.

She won the Stirling Prize, the UK&#x27;s most prestigious award for architecture, two years running: in 2010, for one of her most celebrated works, the MAXXI in Rome, and in 2011 for the Evelyn Grace Academy, a Z‑shaped school in Brixton, London. She also designed the Dongdaemun Design Plaza &amp; Park in Seoul, South Korea, which was the centrepiece of the festivities for the city&#x27;s designation as World Design Capital 2010. In 2014, the Heydar Aliyev Cultural Centre, designed by her, won the Design Museum Design of the Year Award, making her the first woman to win the top prize in that competition. In 2015, she became the first woman to receive the Royal Gold Medal awarded by the Royal Institute of British Architects.

In 2016 in Antwerp, Belgium a square was named after her, &quot;Zaha Hadidplein&quot;, in front of the extension of the Antwerp Harbour House designed by Zaha Hadid.

Google celebrated her achievements with a Doodle on 31 May 2017, to commemorate the date (in 2004) on which Hadid became the first woman to win the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize.

====Incomplete projects====
Vilnius Guggenheim Hermitage Museum in 2008. In 2010, commissioned by the Iraqi government to design the new building for the Central Bank of Iraq. An agreement to complete the design stages of the new CBI building was finalised on 2 February 2012, at a ceremony in London. This was her first project in her native Iraq. In 2012, Hadid won an international competition to design a new National Olympic Stadium as part of the successful bid by Tokyo to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. As the estimated cost of the construction mounted, however, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe announced in July 2015 that Hadid&#x27;s design was scrapped in favour of a new bidding process to seek a less expensive alternative. Hadid had planned to enter the new competition, but her firm was unable to meet the new requirement of finding a construction company with which to partner.

<doc id="513406" wikidata="Q111660571" url="?curid=513406" title="Senate of Southern Ireland">
<text>The Senate of Southern Ireland was the upper house of the Parliament of Southern Ireland, established in 1921 under the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The Act stipulated that there be 64 senators, but only 39 were selected and the Senate met only twice before being dissolved: on 28 June and 13 July 1921 in the Council Room of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction in Dublin.

==Composition==
The Senate&#x27;s composition was specified in the Second Schedule of the 1920 act, and the mode and time of selection in the Fourth Schedule. These were similar to those suggested for the Senate in the report of the Irish Convention of 1917–18. The 64 members were as follows:
* 3 members: 
** The Lord Chancellor of Ireland, intended as the presiding officer of the Senate. The Lord Chancellor had previously been the chairman of the Irish House of Lords in the Parliament of Ireland prior to its abolition.
** The Lord Mayor of Dublin and the Lord Mayor of Cork.
* 17 &quot;Representatives of Commerce (including Banking), Labour, and the Scientific and Learned Professions&quot; to be nominated by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland for a term of 10 years.
* 44 members elected by various interest groups: 
** Elected for a term of 10 years:
*** 4 Archbishops or Bishops of the Roman Catholic Church holding Sees situated wholly or partly in Southern Ireland.
*** 2 Archbishops or Bishops of the Church of Ireland holding Sees situated wholly or partly in Southern Ireland.
*** 16 Peers (not necessarily members of the Peerage of Ireland) who were taxpayers, or ratepayers in respect of property, and had residences, in Southern Ireland.
*** 8 members of the Privy Council of Ireland of no less than two years standing who were taxpayers or ratepayers in respect of property in and had residences in Southern Ireland.
** 14 representatives of county councils, elected for a term of three years:
*** 4 from each of Leinster, Munster, and Connacht
*** 2 from the three Ulster counties not in Northern Ireland (Cavan, Donegal, and Monaghan)

==Election and boycott==
The election details were given by Orders in Council on 22 April 1921, which made the Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper the electoral registrar and returning officer. Elections would use single transferable vote, except that groups electing two senators used multiple non-transferable vote. Only electors of a given group could stand in that group&#x27;s election, except for the county council groups.

Only 39 of the 64 senators were selected or elected. The Irish Republic declared by Sinn Féin in 1919 rejected the legitimacy of the 1920 act. Sinn Féin had gained control of the county councils in the 1920 local elections. Áine Ceannt as secretary of the General Council of County Councils wrote to the Dáil Ministry asking whether to participate. Only W. T. Cosgrave favoured participation, on the basis that the republic&#x27;s First Dáil had agreed to use the Southern Ireland Commons election to select the members of the Second Dáil. Other ministers favoured a boycott, both on the principle that the selection process was undemocratic, and on the pragmatic grounds that unionists would have a majority whereas a boycott would leave it inquorate. Accordingly, on 28 April 1921 Austin Stack as Minister for Home Affairs issued a proclamation ordering &quot;that members of County Councils and other bodies who uphold the right of the Irish people to choose their own representatives and Government take no part in the partial election so proposed for the said Senate&quot;. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Labour Party supported the Republic, and the Catholic hierarchy also refused to co-operate. Of the incomplete membership, many had participated in the Irish Convention.

Of the 39 selected, 27 took the Parliamentary Oath of Allegiance, of whom 19 attended one of the two meetings. Fifteen attended the first and twelve the second, of whom eight attended both. Of the peers and privy councillors, 19 (all bar Cloncurry, Meath, and Westmeath) signed a letter refusing to act as a Senate if the elected Commons were replaced by an appointed &quot;Crown Colony&quot; assembly.

==List==
==Supersession==
In 1922, both the Irish Republic and Southern Ireland were superseded by the Irish Free State. Some of the Southern Ireland senators were subsequently senators in the Free State Seanad (upper house), either appointed by W. T. Cosgrave, President of the Executive Council, or elected by the members of the Dáil (lower house).

<doc id="513407" wikidata="Q220839" url="?curid=513407" title="Luvua River">
<text>The Luvua River (or &quot;Lowa River&quot;) () is a river in the Katanga Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). It flows from the northern end of Lake Mweru on the Zambia-Congo border in a northwesterly direction for to its confluence with the Lualaba River opposite the town of Ankoro. The Lualaba becomes the Congo River below the Boyoma Falls.

==Course==

Lake Mweru, at an elevation of about , is a floodplain lake that has been formed by a process of erosion where the wind has carried off alluvium. The Luvua River leaves the north end of the lake at Pweto in the DRC. The river flows about northwest to Ankoro, where it meets the Lualaba. The middle course of the river is obstructed by a series of rapids, torrents and cataracts as it drops down from the plateau into the Congo Basin. At Piana Mwanga the falls are used to generate electricity for the Manono and Kitotolo mines. The river can be navigated in shallow-draft boats for of its lower course below Kiambi. The Luvua has its peak discharge between March and May, with significantly lower discharge between September and November.

==Watershed==
The Congo River basin has the form of a huge, shallow saucer. The Luvua breaks through the southeast rim of this saucer, bringing water from the Mweru-Bangweulu watershed.
The Luvua drains an area of over , much of which was at one time part of the Zambezi watershed.
There is strong faunal evidence for the Luvua basin having once been part of the Zambezi system, with several species of fish that are common in the Zambezi system also being found in the Luvua.
Congo fauna have penetrated up the Luvua into Lake Mweru, but have been blocked by the Mambatuta Falls from entry into Lake Bangweulu. The transition occurred in the early Tertiary.

==Congo headwater theory==

Some geographers consider that the Luvua is a section of the Congo River. 
They place the origin of the Congo in the highlands between Tanzania and Zambia, where the Chambeshi River originates, flowing southwest to Lake Bangweulu. From that lake the Luapula River emerges and flows northward over to Lake Mweru. The Luvua river exits lake Mweru and flows northwest to join the Lualaba River, which becomes the Congo River further downstream.
Some say that the Congo begins where the Lualaba and Luvua meet.
The argument for treating the Lualaba as the main headwater, although it is much shorter, is that it has twice the volume of water at the point where it meets the Luvua.

==History==

The upper Luvua valley was home to the Bwile people.
Sometime after 1810 Kumwimbe Ngombe, ruler of the Luba Kingdom, conquered the region.
The European missionary and explorer David Livingstone &quot;discovered&quot; Lake Mweru in 1867, and formed the theory that the Luvua flowed to the Upper Nile. It was only after Livingstone&#x27;s death that Henry Morton Stanley in his expedition of 1874-1877 showed that the river in fact was a tributary of the Congo.
Starting in 1891, a Swahili named Shimba launched a series of slave-raiding expeditions that depopulated most of the western shore of Lake Mweru. Shimba joined forces with another Swahili named Kafindo who was based on the upper Luvua and attacked the local Yeke ruler. These attacks continued until the Belgian Braseur arrived and began to &quot;pacify&quot; the region, which the European powers had agreed belonged to Belgium.

In 2000, during the Second Congo War, government forces suffered a major defeat by Rwandan forces at Pweto, at the source of the river. The DRC forces had brought most of their armored vehicles across the river. There was a single ferry, and they did not have enough time to evacuate the vehicles before the Rwandans arrived. Soldiers loaded a T-62 tank awkwardly, and the ferry tipped over and sank. The Rwandans found 33 tanks, as well as other vehicles, which the DRC troops had tried to burn.

<doc id="513408" wikidata="Q3349144" url="?curid=513408" title="Odeon Luxe Leicester Square">
<text>The Odeon Luxe Leicester Square is a prominent cinema building in the West End of London. Built in the Art Deco style and completed in 1937, the building has been continually altered in response to developments in cinema technology, and was the first Dolby Cinema in the United Kingdom.

The cinema occupies the centre of the eastern side of Leicester Square in London, featuring a black polished granite facade and high tower displaying its name. Blue neon outlines the exterior of the building at night. It was built to be the flagship of Oscar Deutsch&#x27;s Odeon Cinema chain and still holds that position today. It hosts numerous European and world film premieres, including the annual Royal Film Performance.

==History==

The Odeon cinema building was completed by Sir Robert McAlpine in 1937 to the design of Harry Weedon and Andrew Mather on the site of Nevill&#x27;s Victorian Turkish baths and the adjoining Alhambra Theatre a large music hall dating from the 1850s. The site cost £550,000, and the cinema took seven months to build, at a cost of £232,755, with 2116 seats. The opening night was Tuesday 2 November 1937; the film shown that night was &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;.

The interior was an art-deco auditorium, with a ribbed ceiling and sidewalls, featuring concealed strip lighting in coves, and two bas relief sculptures of naked nymphs were positioned on the front splay walls, as if leaping towards the screen. All the seats were covered in a faux-leopard skin material. A modernisation in 1967 removed many of the original features, with all of the ribbed plasterwork from the balcony to the proscenium replaced by smooth finishes. A refurbishment in 1998 included new versions of some lost details, including the figures, and seating upholstery pattern.

The UK&#x27;s first widescreen (screen ratio 1.66:1) was installed and premiered on 14 May 1953; the film shown was &quot;Tonight We Sing&quot;. The British public debut of CinemaScope (screen ratio 2.55:1) followed on 19 November 1953 with the quasi-biblical epic, &quot;The Robe&quot;. (The first cinema to install CinemaScope in the UK was the Odeon Tottenham Court Road on 9 June 1953, but it was not open to the public until later).

The theatre&#x27;s chief engineer, Nigel Wolland, was appointed MBE for services to the film industry in 2007. The theatre&#x27;s general manager, Chris Hilton, was appointed MBE for services to the film industry in 2010.

After Nigel Wolland&#x27;s retirement in 2006, Mark Nice was appointed the cinema&#x27;s chief engineer. Mark Nice was later promoted to the position of Odeon company engineer with Toni Purvis and Michael Mannix assuming the role of Operations Manager Digital.

==Technical specifications==

The first Dolby Cinema system to be installed in the UK is at the Odeon in Leicester Square. This introduced a combination of Dolby Vision dual-laser projection system and a Dolby Atmos sound system.

The Odeon is the largest single-screen cinema in the United Kingdom and one of the few with its circle and stalls remaining intact. The cinema is equipped to show films in 35mm, 70mm and digital on a 48 ft. widescreen and includes stage facilities for live performances.

The cinema has an operating Compton organ, its console lit from within by coloured lighting, and a safety curtain detailed in 1930s art-deco motifs.

Two sets of tabs (curtains) are also installed and used for most performances. The cinema houses all major digital sound systems: Sony Dynamic Digital Sound, Dolby Digital and DTS. It had the UK&#x27;s first wide-screen installed in 1953, and more recently, was the first to have a digital projector installed in 1999.
There are 800 seats – including 22 full-recliner seats in the Royal Box – and a &quot;Royal Retiring Room&quot; for visiting monarchs. Oscar&#x27;s Bar (named after Odeon&#x27;s founder Oscar Deutsch) features views across Leicester Square from a glass enclosed balcony.

In March 2011, all the cinema&#x27;s screens converted to digital projection equipment with 3D capability. Up until 2009 the cinema and film distributors did not have faith in the reliability of digital presentations, so the cinema would run a 35mm print alongside. If the digital show failed the projectionist would switch to film. If that projector then failed, the performance would be abandoned. One 35mm/70mm projector has been retained, and has been used for recent 70mm releases including &quot;Interstellar&quot;, &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;, &quot;Dunkirk&quot; and &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;. A silver screen is used for 3D presentations, placed in front of the white screen used for 2D presentations. The silver screen is a fraction smaller and screen tabs are not used during 3D performances. Most of the trained projectionists at the Odeon retired, or were made redundant in 2011. Presentations are now mostly automated.

==Screens 2 – 5==
Five screens, each seating between fifty and sixty patrons, were added in April 1990 in what was once an alleyway running alongside the main house. The screens were originally known as Odeon Mezzanine and were renamed Odeon Studios in 2012. Following the refurbishment in 2018, the number of screens was reduced to four with reduced capacity and renamed as Screens 2 – 5.

==Recent developments==
In 2018 Odeon undertook a full refurbishment at a projected cost of £1015 million, which saw the building retained as a single-screen cinema with stalls and circle levels, with the stated intention to maintain its character. The cinema closed on 10 January 2018 with an anticipated reopening in time for the BFI London Film Festival in October—which it failed to meet. The cinema reopened on 21 December 2018 rebranded as part of the Odeon Luxe chain, with a reduced capacity in luxury seats, an enhanced concession offering, and the first commercial Dolby Cinema screen to open in the UK.

<text>King Senzangakhona kaJama (c. 1762 – 1816) was the king of the Zulu Kingdom, and primarily notable as the father of three Zulu kings who ruled during the period when the Zulus achieved prominence, led by his oldest son King Shaka.

== Biography ==
His father was chief Jama kaNdaba and his mother was Mthaniya Sibiya. He succeeded on his father&#x27;s death. During the chieftaincy of Senzangakhona, the Zulus were a small clan in the Mthethwa confederation which was ruled by Dingiswayo.

Senzangakhona’s name is derived from the Zulu word meaning &quot;he who acts with a good reason&quot;.

Although the Zulus practised ritual circumcision, the practice was slowly dying out. Senzangakhona and Shaka were not circumcised, marking this trend in Zulu culture.

=== Wives and children ===

Senzangakhona married at least sixteen women by which he had fourteen known sons. His daughters were not recorded.

Nandi kaBhebhe eLangeni (Nandi, daughter of Bhebhe, from eLangeni district), bore him his first son Shaka, said to have been conceived during an act of &quot;ukuhlobonga&quot;, a form of &quot;coitus interruptus&quot; without penetration allowed to unmarried couples at a time known as &quot;the fun of the roads&quot; (amahlaya endlela), but the lovers became carried away. Nandi and Shaka were initially accepted into Senzangakhona&#x27;s kraal, and she was treated as a lesser wife. As she was not his Great Wife, Shaka was not the heir. Senzangakhona was unwilling to acknowledge Nandi as his chief consort, an important status symbol among the AmaZulu. He did have another child with her, Shaka&#x27;s sister Nomcuba. Mkabi, the Great Wife, did, however, treat Nandi well. Nevertheless, Nandi&#x27;s relationship with Senzangakhona eventually deteriorated, so she and Shaka were forced to leave the kraal. Bhibhi kaSompisi Ntuli was one of Senzangakhona&#x27;s wives.

Senzangakhona&#x27;s official heir was his son Sigujana. Sigujana took over after the death of his father in 1816. However, Sigujana&#x27;s reign was short as Shaka, with the help of his ally Dingiswayo and his half brother Ngwadi, had Sigujana assassinated. Shaka then raised the chieftaincy into a kingdom and became its first king.

Senzangakhona&#x27; sixth wife, Mpikase kaMlilela Ngobese, bore Dingane, who took over the Zulu kingdom after assassinating his half-brother Shaka in 1828 at present-day Stanger. The official name for this place is KwaDukuza. 

Senzangakhona&#x27;s ninth wife, Songiya kaNgotsha Hlabisa, bore Mpande, who became king when he overthrew Dingane in 1840. Mpande was the only son to bear him grandchildren. Mpande’s son, Cetshwayo kaMpande, was in some aspects the last great king of the Zulus before the British Empire invaded their territory.

== In culture ==
Senzangakhona is played by Conrad Magwaza in the TV miniseries &quot;Shaka Zulu&quot; and In the mini TV miniseries Shaka Ilembe, he is played by Senzo Radebe.

<doc id="513418" wikidata="Q759494" url="?curid=513418" title="Integrated circuit packaging">
<text>Integrated circuit packaging is the final stage of semiconductor device fabrication, in which the die is encapsulated in a supporting case that prevents physical damage and corrosion. The case, known as a &quot;package&quot;, supports the electrical contacts which connect the device to a circuit board.

The packaging stage is followed by testing of the integrated circuit.

== Design considerations ==
=== Electrical ===
The current-carrying traces that run out of the die, through the package, and into the printed circuit board (PCB) have very different electrical properties compared to on-chip signals. They require special design techniques and need much more electric power than signals confined to the chip itself. Therefore, it is important that the materials used as electrical contacts exhibit characteristics like low resistance, low capacitance and low inductance. Both the structure and materials must prioritize signal transmission properties, while minimizing any parasitic elements that could negatively affect the signal.

Controlling these characteristics is becoming increasingly important as the rest of technology begins to speed up. Packaging delays have the potential to make up almost half of a high-performance computer&#x27;s delay, and this bottleneck on speed is expected to increase.

=== Mechanical and thermal ===
The integrated circuit package must resist physical breakage, keep out moisture, and also provide effective heat dissipation from the chip. Moreover, for RF applications, the package is commonly required to shield electromagnetic interference, that may either degrade the circuit performance or adversely affect neighboring circuits. Finally, the package must permit interconnecting the chip to a PCB. The materials of the package are either plastic (thermoset or thermoplastic), metal (commonly Kovar) or ceramic. A common plastic used for this is epoxy-cresol-novolak (ECN). All three material types offer usable mechanical strength, moisture and heat resistance. Nevertheless, for higher-end devices, metallic and ceramic packages are commonly preferred due to their higher strength (which also supports higher pin-count designs), heat dissipation, hermetic performance, or other reasons. Generally, ceramic packages are more expensive than similar plastic packages.

Some packages have metallic fins to enhance heat transfer, but these take up space. Larger packages also allow for more interconnecting pins.

=== Economic ===
Cost is a factor in selection of integrated circuit packaging. Typically, an inexpensive plastic package can dissipate heat up to 2W, which is sufficient for many simple applications, though a similar ceramic package can dissipate up to 50W in the same scenario. As the chips inside the package get smaller and faster, they also tend to get hotter. As the subsequent need for more effective heat dissipation increases, the cost of packaging rises along with it. Generally, the smaller and more complex the package needs to be, the more expensive it is to manufacture. Wire bonding can be used instead of techniques such as flip-chip to reduce costs.

== History ==

Early integrated circuits were packaged in ceramic flat packs, which the military used for many years for their reliability and small size. The other type of packaging used in the 1970s, called the ICP (Integrated Circuit Package), was a ceramic package (sometimes round as the transistor package), with the leads on one side, co-axially with the package axis.

Commercial circuit packaging quickly moved to the dual in-line package (DIP), first in ceramic and later in plastic. In the 1980s VLSI pin counts exceeded the practical limit for DIP packaging, leading to pin grid array (PGA) and leadless chip carrier (LCC) packages. Surface mount packaging appeared in the early 1980s and became popular in the late 1980s, using finer lead pitch with leads formed as either gull-wing or J-lead, as exemplified by small-outline integrated circuit—a carrier which occupies an area about 30–50% less than an equivalent DIP, with a typical thickness that is 70% less.The next big innovation was the &quot;area array package&quot;, which places the interconnection terminals throughout the surface area of the package, providing a greater number of connections than previous package types where only the outer perimeter is used. The first area array package was a ceramic pin grid array package. Not long after, the plastic ball grid array (BGA), another type of area array package, became one of the most commonly used packaging techniques.

In the late 1990s, plastic quad flat pack (PQFP) and thin small-outline packages (TSOP) replaced PGA packages as the most common for high pin count devices, though PGA packages are still often used for microprocessors. However, industry leaders Intel and AMD transitioned in the 2000s from PGA packages to land grid array (LGA) packages.

Ball grid array (BGA) packages have existed since the 1970s, but evolved into flip-chip ball grid array (FCBGA) packages in the 1990s. FCBGA packages allow for much higher pin count than any existing package types. In an FCBGA package, the die is mounted upside-down (flipped) and connects to the package balls via a substrate that is similar to a printed-circuit board rather than by wires. FCBGA packages allow an array of input-output signals (called Area-I/O) to be distributed over the entire die rather than being confined to the die periphery. Ceramic subtrates for BGA were replaced with organic substrates to reduce costs and use existing PCB manufacturing techniques to produce more packages at a time by using larger PCB panels during manufacturing.

Traces out of the die, through the package, and into the printed circuit board have very different electrical properties, compared to on-chip signals. They require special design techniques and need much more electric power than signals confined to the chip itself.

Recent developments consist of stacking multiple dies in single package called SiP, for &quot;System In Package&quot;, or three-dimensional integrated circuit. Combining multiple dies on a small substrate, often ceramic, is called an MCM, or Multi-Chip Module. The boundary between a big MCM and a small printed circuit board is sometimes blurry.

== Common package types ==
* Through-hole technology
* Surface-mount technology
* Chip carrier
* Pin grid array
* Flat package
* Small Outline Integrated Circuit
* Chip-scale package
* Ball grid array
* Transistor, diode, small pin count IC packages
* Multi-chip packages

== Operations ==
For traditional ICs, after wafer dicing, the die is picked from the diced wafer using a vacuum tip or suction cup and undergoes &quot;die attachment&quot; which is the step during which a die is mounted and fixed to the package or support structure (header). In high-powered applications, the die is usually eutectic bonded onto the package, using e.g. gold-tin or gold-silicon solder (for good heat conduction). For low-cost, low-powered applications, the die is often glued directly onto a substrate (such as a printed wiring board) using an epoxy adhesive. 
Alternatively dies can be attached using solder. These techniques are usually used when the die will be wire bonded; dies with flip chip technology do not use these attachment techniques.

IC bonding is also known as die bonding, die attach, and die mount.

The following operations are performed at the packaging stage, as broken down into bonding, encapsulation, and wafer bonding steps. Note that this list is not all-inclusive and not all of these operations are performed for every package, as the process is highly dependent on the package type.
*IC bonding
**Wire bonding
**Thermosonic Bonding
**Down bonding
**Tape automated bonding
**Flip chip
**Quilt packaging
**Film attaching
**Spacer attaching
**Sintering die attach
*IC encapsulation
**Baking
**Plating
**Lasermarking
**Trim and form
*Wafer bonding

Sintering die attach is a process that involves placing the semiconductor die onto the substrate and then subjecting it to high temperature and pressure in a controlled environment.

<text>Warner Village Cinemas was a chain of multiplex cinemas operated by Warner Bros. in the various locations throughout Europe. Created in the late 1980s in the UK as Warner Bros. Cinemas, these locations acted as a rival to Paramount and Universal&#x27;s UCI Cinemas chain. This Warner brand of theatre debuted as the multiplex theatre format location was beginning to replace the traditional in-town style of cinema in the UK. In November 1996, a joint venture between Warner Bros. International Theatres and Village Roadshow Australia was established where the locations would start to share the prospective company names, leading to the title &quot;Warner Village&quot;. The chain expanded by building more sites from 1997 to November 2002, with 40 sites open. The Warner Village chain is considered a continuation of the former UK cinema chain Warner Cinemas, which had operated for many decades prior to the formation.
==United Kingdom==
Its first in the UK was in Bury, Greater Manchester. The grand opening was in June 1989, the opening film was &quot;Police Academy 6: City Under Siege&quot; with stars of the film flown over for the event, in which Bruce Willis was also at the event with Liza Minnelli cutting the opening ribbon. The chain had 36 cinemas with 354 screens including the flagship in Leicester Square when it was purchased by SBC International Cinemas in May 2003. SBC rebranded all the cinemas as Vue Cinemas starting in March 2004, including the refurbishment of the foyers, the lighting and replacing screen numbers in some cinemas. During the transition, some Warner Village locations retained the branding until early 2006 as some certain cinemas were owned and operated solely by Village Roadshow Australia.

===Warner West End===
The flagship and arguably most notable Warner Village Cinema was the Warner West End in Leicester Square, London, a multiplex that used to host Warner film premieres. This theatre features two bas-relief sculptures, &quot;Sight&quot; and &quot;Sound&quot;, sculpted by Edward Bainbridge Copnall. This location had a history way back to the early days of motion pictures, with it being an original Warner Theatre from the early 20th Century. A notable event for this location was the 1993 premiere of the film &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, this was a reopening of the location after a lengthy renovation to bring the location in line with the design of the &#x27;Warner Cinemas&#x27; multiplex chain. The star of &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, Harrison Ford, attended to place a time capsule to commemorate the event. In 2003, during the Vue rebrand, this location became Vue West End. The interior formed in the 1993 reopening (aside from Warner logos) was maintained up until 2017, when Vue performed an overhaul renovation to the location to update the tired design and renew interest.

==Other territories==
The cinema chain also operated in Taiwan, opening a cinema in a shopping mall named Warner Village Cinema Centre in Taipei. In 2005 it was bought out and renamed .

In October 2009, the Italian franchise of Warner Village was bought by the Benetton Group and merged with Mediaset&#x27;s Medusa Multicinema to create The Space Cinema. It was originally a joint venture between Warner Bros. International Theatres, Village Roadshow Australia and Focus Srl., the local Italian partner. This was the last surviving branch of the Warner Village Cinemas franchise.

==Sponsorship==
From March 2, 2001 until December 2003, Warner Village Cinemas was the sponsor of ITV LWT&#x27;s weather forecasts (or simply &quot;London Weekend Weather / London Weather at the Weekend&quot; as from 2 November 2002), as well as being advertised on some British Warner Home Videos. On the 2002 video game &quot;The Getaway&quot;, Warner Village was promoted through advertising billboards which could be found on London Taxis throughout the game.

<doc id="513431" wikidata="Q3349143" url="?curid=513431" title="Odeon Luxe West End">
<text>The Odeon Luxe West End is a two-screen cinema on the south side of Leicester Square, London. It has historically been used for smaller film premieres and hosting the annual BFI London Film Festival. The site is on an adjacent side of the square to the much larger flagship Odeon Luxe Leicester Square.

Odeon Cinemas sold the building to three Irish investors in 2006, who continued to lease it. In 2012, it was bought by the Radisson Edwardian hotel group. It closed as a cinema on 1 January 2015. After extensive asbestos removal, the entire site was demolished the same year.

It reopened in September 2021 as an Odeon Luxe cinema, following a £300 million redevelopment of the site that also includes a luxury hotel. It is London&#x27;s second Dolby Cinema.

== History ==

=== 1930–1940 ===
The Leicester Square Theatre was built for actor/film star Jack Buchanan and impresario Walter Gibbons. Buchanan had a large two-storey apartment built on top of the theatre, which he occupied until it was damaged by bombing in late October 1940. NatWest later occupied this as their main London offices spread over two floors, but vacated it in the early 2000s and was damaged by squatters a few years later with graffiti everywhere, ceiling tiles punched out and carpet ripped up.

Designed by architect Andrew Mather, the Leicester Square Theatre was intended as a live theatre, but there were problems acquiring adjacent properties and the stage space proved insufficient. It opened on 19 December 1930 as a dual-purpose live theatre/cinema with 1,760 seats in stalls, dress circle and balcony levels. There were three boxes adjacent to each side of the proscenium at dress circle level, but these were only used during live performances. The foyer walls were decorated with polished black marble. The first operators were Warner Brothers and the opening programme was the Warner Brothers two-tone Technicolor film Viennese Nights starring Vivienne Segal supported by a stage dance production including Balliol and Merton and the Victoria Girls. It was equipped with a Wurlitzer 3 Manual/10 Rank theatre organ.

It was taken over in March 1931 by RKO Radio Pictures. In July 1931, Gracie Fields appeared for a week &#x27;twice-nightly&#x27; as a prelude to her film &quot;Sally in Our Alley&quot;. Jack Hulbert song and dance show &#x27;The R.K.O. Loudspeakers&#x27; was staged as part of the film programme in August 1931. It was taken over by County Cinemas and renamed Olympic Theatre from 21 March 1932, re-opening with John Stuart in &quot;In a Monastery Garden&quot;. County Cinemas had commissioned architect Alister G. MacDonald to re-design the entrance and the interior was re-designed by Edward Carrick. A revolve was installed in the centre of the stage at this time. It closed in July 1932 and Jack Buchanan took control again. In August 1932, films were dropped in favour of non-stop variety, which began with Non-Stop Revels live on stage, non-stop from two &#x27;til midnight daily. Marie Kendall, singing &quot;Just Like the Ivy&quot;, was one of the artistes appearing. This policy lasted for almost a year.

The theatre was then taken over again by United Artists and on 27 September 1933 re-opened as a full-time cinema, once more re-named the Leicester Square Theatre, with Jack Buchanan&#x27;s own film for United Artists &quot;That&#x27;s a Good Girl&quot;. It played United Artists pictures first run in London until it was closed again on 18 July 1937 for redecoration. It re-opened on 16 September 1937 with &quot;Victoria the Great&quot;, starring Anna Neagle.

In 1938, General Film Distributors took control (J. Arthur Rank was one of the directors) and it became the first West End Cinema to be controlled by what would become the Rank Organisation in later years.

=== 1940–1967 ===
The cinema was closed for almost a year from late-October 1940 when it suffered bomb damage. It re-opened on 11 July 1941 with &quot;The Flame of New Orleans&quot;. Oscar Deutsch Odeon Theatres Ltd. took over in July 1946, and they closed it in July 1950 for some repairs to be carried out to the war damage.

The UK premiere of Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; was held here on 26 July 1951. Further repairs were carried out in 1955. The UK premiere of Laurence Olivier&#x27;s production of &quot;Richard III&quot; took place in August 1955, and it ran here for thirteen weeks. &quot;The Longest Day&quot; played as a &#x27;roadshow&#x27; presentation from 11 October 1962 until 4 September 1963. The UK premiere of&quot; Mary Poppins&quot; opened here on 17 December 1964 and played for several weeks before transferring to the Odeon Haymarket. The European Gala Premiere of &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot; starring Tommy Steele was held here on 26 October 1967. The Leicester Square Theatre was closed on 3 April 1968 with &quot;Carry On Doctor&quot;. The cinema was to undergo a complete interior refurbishment. The Wurlitzer organ, which was played at special organ concerts right up to closing, was also removed from the building.

=== 1968–1988 ===

Architects Arnold Dick Associates designed a new ‘modern style’ single screen cinema within the shell of the building, with a stalls and circle seating areas (removing the upper balcony) and the interior design was by Cassidy, Farrington and Dennys. Seating was provided for 1,407: 900 in the stalls and 507 in the circle.

Most of the detailed French Renaissance style interior was stripped out, with only the ceiling in particular retained, albeit punctured by steelwork and hidden from view by a new lower ceiling, ultimately falling into a state of disrepair with sections of moulded plasterwork coming away.

The Leicester Square Theatre re-opened on 12 December 1968 with a Royal Charity Premiere attended by Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon and Lord Snowdon of &quot;Shalako&quot;, starring Sean Connery. It was equipped for 70mm presentations. Over the following 48 years it hosted many film premieres, including &quot;Papillon&quot; in March 1974, &quot;Tommy&quot; in March 1975, and &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; in 1986.

=== 1988–2015 ===

It was renamed Odeon West End from 22 July 1988 with the opening of the comedy film &quot;The Couch Trip&quot;. It closed for twinning on 11 July 1991 with &quot;The Pope Must Die&quot;. The Odeon West End re-opened on 11 October 1991 with screen 1 upstairs seating 503 playing &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot; and screen 2 downstairs opening on 1 November 1991 with 848 seats playing &quot;Twenty-One&quot;. In 2008, the UK premiere of &quot;Sex and the City&quot; saw the film play in both auditoriums with every single session selling out. Sometimes, the film distributors would force the Odeon film bookings department to play less than popular movies as they were contracted to play a certain number of films at Odeon West End each year. Quite often, shows were run with less than 10 people attending each screening.

The Odeon West End had an exclusive run of &quot;The Master&quot; from 2 November 2012, playing a 70mm print of the film. The cinema, in its later years, was also the West End base for the annual London Film Festival.

The site was sold by Odeon Cinemas to three Irish investors in February 2006, though continued to operate as part of the Odeon chain. Ownership subsequently passed to the Irish National Asset Management Agency and in 2012 it was sold to the Radisson Hotels company.

A new set of plans for a hotel were approved by Westminster Council on 21 January 2014, and the Odeon West End closed on 1 January 2015. The final films were &quot;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1&quot;, showing in screen 1 upstairs (489-seats) and &quot;Interstellar&quot;, showing in screen 2 downstairs (814-seats). &quot;Interstellar&quot; had been screened in a 70mm print until 24 December, and was replaced by a digital copy for its final seven days.

== Demolition ==
In January 2014, Westminster City Council approved a plan by Radisson Hotels to demolish the building and replace it with an eight-storey 360-room hotel, which would also include a two-screen Odeon cinema in the basement.

Odeon cinema staff had four days to remove their equipment from the building, which was handed over to the demolition contractors on 5 January 2015, and demolition began in April 2015 and was completed in September 2015.

== Reopening ==

The cinema reopened in September 2021 as the Odeon Luxe West End, occupying the basement of The Londoner, a new boutique hotel with six underground floors as well as nine above-ground. The redevelopment was undertaken by Arup.

The cinema has two screens. The main auditorium features a Dolby Vision laser projector and Dolby Atmos audio.

The Odeon Luxe West End was one of seven London venues that hosted the BFI London Film Festival 2021. The theater also hosted the premiere of the 2024 Dolby Cinema remaster of Tom Hooper&#x27;s 2012 film adaptation of the musical &quot;Les Miserables&quot;.

<text>Paris was a small community in the Klondike region of Yukon, Canada on Dominion Creek during the Klondike Gold Rush (1898). Postal contract documents showed that it still existed in 1911, but all traces have disappeared today. It owed its name to its large proportion of French speakers and the fact that its postmaster was born in Paris, France.

<text>Professor Maggie Walsh is a fictional character in the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The character is portrayed by Lindsay Crouse.

==History==

Professor Maggie Walsh is introduced in season 4, as Buffy&#x27;s psychology professor at the University of California, Sunnydale, but is later revealed as the leader of the government-controlled Initiative, a military project intent on capturing, studying, and modifying the behavior of various demons. Unknown to many in the Initiative, Walsh is also involved in Project 314, a secret program within the Initiative that is creating a hybrid demon-humanoid-mechanoid (demonoid) known as Adam. Various creatures captured by the Initiative were dissected to provide the parts for Adam.

Maggie maintains a close relationship with Riley Finn (Marc Blucas), who is her favorite soldier; she appears to think of him as a son. After Riley learns that Buffy is the Slayer, they inform Walsh of her role. Walsh initially thinks that Buffy can be a useful ally to the Initiative, but soon takes a dislike to her unpredictability and unwelcome curiosity, especially regarding the &quot;314 Project&quot;. Cameras installed in Riley&#x27;s room allow her to spy on Buffy and Riley while they have sex, and later to hear Buffy ask Riley about the 314 Project. Perceiving that Buffy poses a risk to the project, Walsh tries to kill Buffy by sending her on a mission on which she is ambushed by two demons released from the Initiative&#x27;s holding cells. Buffy defeats the demons and appears on the monitors after Walsh has prematurely announced Buffy&#x27;s death to Riley, who walks out. Walsh retreats to the labs of Project 314, where she plots how to use Adam to defeat Buffy. However, Adam awakens and impales Walsh, killing her, and escapes from the Initiative.

Walsh appears in the penultimate episode of season 4, &quot;Primeval,&quot; as a zombie, working under Adam along with others Adam has killed. Attempting to finish off Project 314, begun by Walsh, Adam has his workers manufacturing more creatures like himself; part demon, human, and machine combined. Adam activates the chip Walsh had inserted into Riley&#x27;s heart, making him biddable to Adam&#x27;s command. Zombie Walsh attacks Buffy when she comes to Riley&#x27;s rescue, but Buffy knocks her down and defeats her, and with some help from the Scooby-Gang of Willow, Xander, and Giles, she defeats Adam as well. The Initiative project is shut down permanently.

==Writing and acting==
Crouse viewed her character &quot;no nonsense, and she seems to be a real teacher. She&#x27;s like a President. She really would like to fashion the world in her image. She&#x27;s not a mean person, she&#x27;s just a straight-out scientist.&quot;

In a gender studies text, Jowett includes a section on the character, and argues the character is &quot;masculinized by her roles as professor, scientist and leader.&quot;

Crouse has explained how her character was initially explained to her, &quot;Joss tried to explain to me who this character was. He said that she was a scientist, and that she was going to be doing research and eventually, she might hatch an evil plot, but her front was being a psychology teacher.&quot;

Crouse gave some insight into her view on her character, &quot;She&#x27;s such an extremist. She has a vision of what she wants to do. She feels like she&#x27;s testing the boundaries of something, and any human being always feels important no matter who they are. I&#x27;m sure she admires Dr. Frankenstein - or Einstein. She&#x27;s probably a mix of those two. I like her caustic nature, because she&#x27;s not a mean person. I have always imagined that Maggie treats people like grown-ups. That she doesn&#x27;t want to live in a world of babies. She doesn&#x27;t have the time for it. The Initiative is her baby.&quot;

Crouse outlined her view of Maggie&#x27;s relationships with Riley and Buffy, &quot;Her teaching assistant Riley is really the child she never had, and there&#x27;s probably confusion there that he&#x27;s a potential something for her that&#x27;s slightly out of her reach, but she&#x27;s willing to prevent anyone else from being interested in him. I think she feels she&#x27;s in direct competition with Buffy. The most complicated situation for her is having Riley fall in love with Buffy. Finding out that Buffy is the Slayer is a kind of a gas, and it&#x27;s nervous-making and exciting to have good people on her team; she&#x27;s like a president - she wants a great cabinet underneath her. I think she&#x27;d like to fashion the world in her image, but Buffy puts a wrench in the works&quot;.

&quot;Buffy&quot; writer David Fury said in an interview, &quot;I don&#x27;t think Joss had envisioned Maggie Walsh as being entirely villainous. As opposed to just sort of misguided.&quot;

<doc id="513456" wikidata="Q1755480" url="?curid=513456" title="Mazda MX-3">
<text>The Mazda MX-3 is a 2+2-seat, front-wheel drive coupé of a kammback design, manufactured and marketed by Mazda. It was introduced at the Geneva Auto Show in March 1991 and marketed until 1998.

The MX-3 was also marketed as the Mazda MX-3 Precidia in Canada and as the [[Eunos (automobile)|Eunos]] Presso, [[Autozam]] AZ-3 and Mazda AZ-3 in Japan. In Australia it was marketed as the Eunos 30X until late 1996 when it became the Mazda-Eunos 30X.

==History==
The MX-3&#x27;s platform is called the EC platform, and shares much with the BG platform of the contemporary Familia/323/Protegé. The first model year was available in Japan, Europe, Australia, and North America where it went on sale in September 1991, as a 1992. Originally available with a single-cam 1.6-liter inline-four or the 1.8-liter twin-cam V6, a few more engines were available as development continued. In the summer of 1991, the Autozam AZ-3 was added to the Japanese market lineup. It was known by two names;&quot;Autozam&quot; was meant to be Mazda&#x27;s more youthful brand, so it combined a somewhat lower price with a sportier (but smaller) twin-cam 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine, and also sold as the Eunos Presso, a companion, affordable sports hatchback to the Eunos Roadster.

The small displacement V6 was offered to set the small coupé apart in the marketplace, while providing a balanced, smooth running engine. Project Manager Tadayuki Hayashi had also used to be an avid motorcyclist and enjoyed engines with a peaky power delivery - the little V6 delivered its peak torque at an unusually high 5,300 rpm.

In January 1994, a DOHC version of the familiar B6 engine, the &quot;B6D&quot;, replaced the previous version. This provided a useful power increase but conversely also made the considerably more expensive V6 version less desirable. Sales of the V6 in the United States market came to an end after the 1994 model year, although they continued in Canada, Japan and many other export markets. While called &quot;K8-DE&quot; in North American specs, Japanese and other markets received an engine called the &quot;K8-ZE&quot;. Aside from emissions equipment and varying power claims due to myriad ratings methods, the differences are negligible.

Mazda referred to the car as a four-seater, but the rear seats were ostensibly designed to hold people of &quot;AF 50&quot; dimensions (50th percentile, Asian Female) and the car was a de facto 2+2 design. The MX-3 was only manufactured for one generation as the MX-5 proved more popular. As the Japanese asset price bubble effects became noticeable, Mazda had to cut back models that weren&#x27;t selling well and the MX-3 was cancelled.

==Performance==

The V6 MX-3 has a factory claimed top speed of in European trim. The US-spec MX-3 GS can accelerate from 0 to in 8.4 seconds, and can travel a quarter mile in 16.4 seconds. With a turning rate of 0.89 g (8.7 m/s²), its handling capabilities were among the best in its class.

The V6 engine belonged to the Mazda K-series, which were used in a range of Mazda vehicles. These engines use a Variable Length Intake Manifold (VLIM), in order to provide optimal torque using intake resonance. Mazda called their system on the MX-3 the &quot;Variable Resonance Induction System&quot; (VRIS). This engine had a 7,000 rpm redline, and a 7,800 rpm fuel cutoff.

For the rear suspension of the MX-3, Mazda used its proprietary Twin-Trapezoidal Link (TTL) technology, delivering benefits associated with active four-wheel steering systems while lighter and less mechanically complicated. Twin-Trapezoidal Link technology has been used on a range of other Mazda vehicles before and since the MX-3.

===Models and specifications===

;Models (North America):
* RS • 1992-1996
* GS • 1992–1994 (Canada until 1995)

;Engines:
==Special editions==

In 1993, Mazda Canada offered a limited special edition model of its Mazda MX-3 GS to celebrate the company&#x27;s 25th year in Canada. At the same time, Mazda USA offered a similar model in a special edition as well. Only a total of 2,000 were supposedly made. The special edition MX-3 featured the V6 engine, leather interior (including seats, steering wheel and shift knob), heated seats (Canada only), and custom Enkei manufactured 15 inch alloy wheels. Most special edition models came in the color &quot;raspberry metallic&quot;; however, there was also &quot;blaze&quot; red, &quot;brilliant&quot; black, and &quot;laguna&quot; blue.

In 1993, Mazda Europe produced 100 Mazda MX-3 V6 SEs. These had a leather and suede interior, and all had the clear white body color. There were also a limited number of Mazda MX-3 V6 Equipes, with &quot;sparkle green metallic&quot; or &quot;noble&quot; green exteriors.

==Modifications==

The MX-3 is becoming a rare car, so modifications for it can be difficult to find unless one knows where to look, since it has not been sold in North America since 1997. Since the MX-3 has two engine classes, I4 and V6, many of the engine performance modifications are dependent upon what platform is installed.

There is now a decent range of body modifications for the MX-3 along with performance brakes and suspension. Most extensive modification must be entirely custom fabricated due to limited availability.

===RS===

The MX-3 RS with the four-cylinder engine can upgrade to the BP , B6-T , BP-T and BPD-T engines.

Swapping of the four-cylinder RS engines is slightly more complicated than the V6 GS mainly due to ECU, wiring harness, and MAF combinations as well as motor mounts. The V6 swaps require specific ECU, intake manifold, and VAF sensor combinations, but there are far fewer variables to deal with. Many improvements can be made after the engine swap and during the engine tuning process to find the best combination of engine peripherals.

===GS===
The most common engine swap for MX-3 GS owners with the V6 engine is a 2.5 L V6, either a North American-spec KL-DE , found most commonly in the 1993–1997 Ford Probe GT, the 1993–1997 Mazda MX-6 LS, or the 1993–2002 Mazda 626 LX or ES, and the Japanese-spec KL-ZE , found in such vehicles as the Efini MS-8, Xedos 9, and Eunos 800. A 2.0 L V6 KF-ZE is also available, but this swap is quite difficult due to the unavailability of required components. For this reason, this particular engine swap is not often attempted.
The GS, apart from the engine has dual tip exhaust, a tighter steering ratio, four disc brakes and front and rear spoiler.
