<text>The Chinese Buddhist canon refers to a traditional collection of Chinese language Buddhist texts which are the central canonical works of East Asian Buddhism. The traditional term for the canon is Great Storage of Scriptures (). The Chinese canon is a major source of scriptural and spiritual authority for East Asian Buddhism (the Buddhism of China, Korea, Japan and Vietnam). It is also an object of worship and devotion for Asian Buddhists and its reproduction is seen as an act of merit making. The canon has also been called by other names like “Internal Classics” (neidian 内典), “Myriad of Scriptures” (zhongjing 眾經), or “All Scriptures” (yiqieing 一切經). 

The development of the &quot;Great Storage of Scriptures&quot; was influenced by the Indian Buddhist concept of a Tripitaka, literally meaning &quot;three baskets&quot; (of Sutra, Vinaya, and Abhidharma), a term which referred to the scriptural canons of the various Indian Buddhist schools. However, Chinese Buddhists historically did not have access to a single Tripitaka from one school or collection. Instead, the canon grew over centuries as various Indian texts were translated and new texts composed in China. These various works (4,878 individual texts according to the Chinese scholar He Mei) were later collected into a distinct Chinese canon. 

The Chinese Buddhist Canon also contains many texts which were composed outside of the Indian subcontinent, including numerous texts composed in China, such as philosophical treatises, commentaries, histories, philological works, catalogs, biographies, geographies, travelogues, genealogies of famous monks, encyclopedias and dictionaries. As such, the &quot;Great Storage of Scriptures&quot;, the foundation of East Asian Buddhist teachings, reflects the evolution of Chinese Buddhism over time, and the religious and scholarly efforts of generations of translators, scholars and monastics. This process began with the first translations in the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) after which a period of intense translation work followed in the succeeding dynasties. The first complete canons appear in the Eastern Jin and the Sui Dynasties, while the first woodblock printed canon (xylography), known as the Kaibao Canon, was printed during the Song dynasty between 971 to 983. Later eras saw further editions of the canon published in China, Korea and Japan like the Tripitaka Koreana (11th &amp; 13th centuries) and the Qianlong Canon (1735-1738). One of the most widespread edition used by modern scholars today is the Taishō Tripiṭaka, produced in Japan in the 20th century. More recent developments have seen the establishment of digital canons available online, such as CBETA online (Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association).

The language of these scriptures is termed &quot;Buddhist Chinese&quot; (&quot;Fojiao&quot; &quot;Hanyu&quot; 佛教漢語), and is a variety of literary Chinese with several unique elements such as a distinctly Buddhist terminology that includes transliterations from Indian languages and newly coined Chinese Buddhist words. 

== History ==

=== Early period ===
In India, the early Buddhist teachings were collected into canons called tripiṭaka (‘three baskets’; Chin. 三藏 sānzàng ‘three stores’ or ‘three repositories’). Most canons contained sūtras (discourses of the Buddha, 經 jīng), monastic rule texts (vinaya; 律 lǜ); and scholastic treatises (abhidharma; 阿毘曇 āpítán or 阿毗達磨 āpídámó). Initially these sources were transmitted orally but later they were written down into various manuscript collections. Each of the Indian Buddhist schools had their own canon, which could differ significantly from that of other schools and be in different languages (prakrits like Gandhari and Pali, as well as classic Sanskrit and Hybrid Sanskrit). Some schools had extra pitakas or divisions, including a Dharani Pitaka, or Bodhisattva Pitakas.

According to Guangchang Fang, the history of the Chinese Buddhist Canon can be divided into four main periods: the handwriting era (from the Han up to the 10th century) which was also the era of intense translation effort, the era of woodblock printing (beginning in the Song dynasty with the Kaibao edition of the 10th century), the era of modern printing, and the digital era.

The first Chinese translations of Buddhist texts appeared during the later Han Dynasty during the reign of Emperor Ming (r. 58–75 ce). The first sutra to be translated is said to be the &quot;Sutra of Forty-two Sections&quot; (四十二章經 sìshíèr zhāng jīng). Many of the early translators were monks from Central Asia, like the Parthian Ān Shìgāo (安世高), and the Kuchan translator Kumārajīva (鳩摩羅什; 343– 413). Later figures were native Chinese who traveled to India and studied Sanskrit texts there, like Fǎxiǎn (法顯, c. 337–422 ce) and Xuánzàng (玄奘, 602–664 ce). Most translators who produced significant translations did not work alone, making use of teams of translators and scribes. Thus, the texts of the Chinese canon were translated by various figures from different source texts (in different forms of Sanskrit and prakrit). This process happened over several centuries and thus the various texts of the Chinese canon reflect different translation styles and philosophies. According to a Yuan dynasty catalogue (the &quot;Zhiyuan fabao kantong zonglu&quot; 至元法寶堪同總錄), there were about 194 known translators who worked on about 1,440 texts in 5,580 fascicles (juans). Jiang Wu writes that &quot;for about a thousand years, translating, cataloging, and digesting these texts became a paramount task for Chinese Buddhists.&quot;

From the Han to the Song dynasty era, many translations were made and made new texts were also composed in China. During the Eastern Jin and the Sui Dynasties, the earliest canons were compiled using manuscripts. None of these early manuscript canons have survived. The earliest surviving manuscripts from the early Chinese canons are found in the Dunhuang text collections and the earliest catalogue of the contents of the canon is the &quot;Lidai sanbao ji&quot; 歷代三寳記 (&quot;Records of the Dharma Jewels through the Generations&quot;) by Fei Changfang (fl. 562–598). There are also many early manuscripts which have survived in the libraries of Japanese temples. 

Another surviving early collection of Chinese Buddhist canonical material is the Fangshan Stone Sutras (房山石經) which a set of around 15,000 stone tablets containing Buddhist sutras carved at Yúnjū Temple (雲居寺). This project was begun in the 7th century by a devout monk named Jìngwǎn. His followers at the temple continue to carve sutras on stone tablets for generations after (even well into the Ming dynasty). The earliest dated &quot;Heart Sutra&quot; from 661 comes from this collection of stone carved sutras. 
Alongside the study, translation and copying of these numerous texts, Chinese Buddhists spent much time organizing, classifying and cataloguing them. In this effort, Chinese Buddhists were also influenced by the work of Confucian cataloging, especially the work of Liu Xiang (77–6 BCE). 

A key milestone in the organization of the canon was the compilation of the &quot;Kaiyuan Catalogue&quot; (Kāiyuán Shìjiàolù, 開元釋教錄, &quot;Kaiyuan Era Record of Buddhist Teachings&quot;, Taishō Tripitaka No. 2154) during the Tang dynasty by the monk Zhisheng (699-740). This catalogue provided the main blueprint for the restoration and organization of future canons after the Great Buddhist Persecution in 845. The Kaiyuan catalogue is also considered by modern scholars as a text which &quot;closed&quot; or fixed the core portion of the canon. As such, according to Jiang Wu &quot;for centuries, despite the fact that the canon has continued to grow, this core body has remained stable, without much alteration.&quot; This Kaiyuan set of core texts became the defining feature of the Chinese Buddhist canon. Any collection that did not include these was not considered a complete canon. However, many monasteries or temples who could not afford to maintain a full set would keep a “Small Canon” (xiaozang 小藏), which consisted of the essential Mahayana scriptures found within the canon. These are the Mahayana sutras contained in the first four sections of the canon: Prajñaparamita, Ratnakuta, Avatamsaka and Nirvana sections). 

=== The print era ===
The developments of the early manuscript canons influenced the compilation of the first printed canon (the Kaibao Canon) during the Song dynasty. The Kaibao was completed in 983 and comprised 130,000 woodblocks, organized according to the Kaiyuan catalogue. Printing technology brought about a revolution in how the canon was reproduced, as well as in its layout, style and the various social elements associated with its production.

After the Song, the manuscript canons gradually disappeared and were replaced by printed canons. However, the practice of hand copying sutras remained an important religious practice, some figures famously copied sutras by hand in their own blood. Sutra copying was also retained as an elite art form that made use of ink mixed with gold and silver powder and produced richly decorated manuscripts. This shift from manuscript culture to xylography introduced several changes to the physical layout and other material aspects of the new printed canons. One of these changes was the use of the &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot; for a library classification system. Each text was assigned a character from this classic work which was widely memorized by school children and thus known by all educated persons.

Regarding physical aspects, while the Kaibao canon came in scrolls made from several sheets of paper pasted together, later editions were packaged in different styles such as accordion folding books and the string binding style initiated by the Jiaxing canon (also called &quot;Indian style&quot; since it imitated Indian manuscripts). Texts were also preceded or closed by prefaces and colophons that contained information such as titles, text origin, printing date, sponsors, and even the names of printers and binders. Some editions also included illustrations of various scenes, such as Buddha assemblies from specific sutras and landscapes. Various types of paper were used for the canons, many of them being made from mulberry and hemp, while woodblocks were made from pear wood or jujube wood. 

After printing, a canon would usually be stored monasteries and temples. Many monasteries in imperial China also had specific buildings where their copies of the canon were stories, which were called Tripitaka Pavilions (zangjingge 藏經閣) or Tripitaka Tower (jingge 经阁 or jinglou 經樓). Temples also had special cabinets produced for storing canonical texts. These huge cabinets were called &quot;tripitaka cabinets&quot; and were of different designs. Some were built into the walls of a library, others were revolving repositories (lunzang 輪藏) that could be turned to easily access different texts. These revolving storage structures were also devotional items, as it was often believed that turning these repositories could bring good merit. 

In the following one thousand years of Chinese Buddhist history, fifteen further editions of the Chinese Buddhist canon were constructed. Half of these were royal editions, supported by the Imperial Court, while other canons were made through the efforts of laypersons and monastics.

=== Producing and worshiping the canon ===

Throughout its history, the Chinese Buddhist canon was also an object of worship and devotion for whole Buddhist communities. It represented the ultimate teaching of the Buddha and the Buddha&#x27;s body. This practice has its roots in the Indian worship of Mahayana sutras. Some scholars even speak of a &quot;cult of the canon&quot; when referring to the various devotional activities which revolved around the creation, distribution, and preservation of the Chinese Buddhist canon. These activities included sponsoring the printing of a canon, working on the project, ceremonial rituals consecrating the texts, reading and manual ritual copying of the texts (a practice which remained important even as printing dominated the production of sutras). 

Many Chinese elites, including the imperial family and also even common people all aspired to support the copying and distribution of the Buddhist canon. Printing and owning a full set of the canon was considered to enhance the prestige of a temple or monastery, while sponsoring the production of the canon was considered to have protective and apotropaic powers which could extent to the nation. Thus, one of the reasons for the copying of the Korean canon was the belief that the merit produced by this act could protect the nation from foreign invasion. Likewise, the emperors of the Tang dynasty believed that sponsoring the production of Buddhist canons would have numerous benefits, including protecting the nation, bringing peace, bring good merit to the imperial family, and make the nation&#x27;s subjects more moral and less rebellious. Monks, literati and even commoners also supported the copying and printing of the canon to a lesser extent, sometimes doing the copying themselves as a devotional practice or providing funds for a single page or a single block to be carved. 

The production and printing of the Chinese canon often relied on extensive administrative offices which supervised the project. Editions sponsored by the state were often produced by a specific government printing agency. During the Ming, this was called the scripture factory (jingchang 經廠) and it was run by eunuchs. Furthermore, at the local level, various administrative agencies also oversaw the transfer of an imperial canon to a Buddhist monastery. In the Ming, this process was handled by the Ministry of Rites. The process relied on numerous types of staff, including &quot;the sponsors, supporters, chief fund raisers, assistant fund raisers, chief monks to manage the canon, chief monks to manage the print blocks, collators and proofreaders, carvers, and printing workers.&quot; There were also many private individuals which were involved, including private printing shops, monastic printers, merchants, and local literati. 

Aside from copying and reading, another textual practice which was popular in Asia was the ceremony called &quot;sunning the scriptures&quot; (shaijing 曬經), which developed out of the need to regularly take out texts to prevent dampness. This utilitarian practice developed into a ritual in which the texts would be displayed to the public who would come to venerate them. 

Another popular ritual was the ceremonial reading of the entire canon, a rite called &quot;turning the scriptures&quot; (zhuanjing 轉經). This was also sometimes done by a person as a solitary spiritual practice. Ritually reading the whole canon was said to bring much merit, and it was also sometimes used as a funerary practice. Yet another common practice was the circumambulation around the canon stored in a Tripitaka Hall which was accompanied by chanting.

== Language ==
The texts of the Chinese Buddhist canon are written in a unique variant of written Chinese which is termed Buddhist Chinese by scholars. This language is the main religious and liturgical language of East Asian Buddhism. It was the main language of Buddhist scholasticism and liturgy not just in China, but in Korea, Japan and Vietnam for all of their pre-modern history. Scholars also distinguish between two main categories of Buddhist Chinese: the language of Chinese translations of Indian texts and the language of indigenous Chinese compositions.

&quot;Buddhist Chinese&quot; contains several features that distinguish it from standard literary Chinese. One of these is the fact that Buddhist Chinese makes greater of disyllabic and polysyllabic words. Much of this is due to Buddhist terminology not found in other literary Chinese works. Some of these are transliterations from Indian languages such as Sanskrit, for example 波羅蜜 (pinyin: bōluómì) for the Sanskrit term pāramitā and 佛陀 (Middle Chinese pronunciation: *butda, modern pronunciation: fotuo). Buddhist Chinese also includes many calques or loanword translations. Examples include 如來 (pinyin: rúlái, &quot;thus come&quot;) which refers to the term Tathagata, and fangbian 方便 (lit. “method and convenience”, a term for upāya).

Buddhist Chinese texts also contain unique syntax which is not used in non-Buddhist literary Chinese. One example is the use of vocatives in the middle of a sentence, which is not allowed in grammar of classical Chinese but is found in Sanskrit. For example, in his &quot;Vimalakirti Sutra&quot; translation, the translator Zhi Qian sometimes follows the Sanskrit word order: 時 我 世尊 聞 是 法 默 而 止 不 能 加 報 (At that moment, I, Oh Lord, heard this law, [was] silent and stopped [speaking]; Skt. aham bhagavan etām śrutvā tūṣṇīm eva abhūvam). This matching of the word order of the Sanskrit source texts is common in Chinese Buddhist translations.

Another feature of Buddhist Chinese is that many Buddhist Chinese texts tend to rely on more vernacular elements than non-Buddhist literary Chinese.

However, these generalizations should be understood to be very broad since, as Lock and Linebarger write:it should be borne in mind that the term in fact covers the language of thousands of texts, both those translated from Sanskrit and other languages, and those written originally in Chinese. The texts are also in a large number of different genres, and were produced over a period of nearly two thousand years. This vast corpus includes texts in a kind of ‘translationese’, influenced by the vocabulary and grammar of the original languages from which they were translated, texts written throughout in an elegant Wenyan style, and texts containing a lot of colloquial language, some of which is recognizably MSC [Modern Standard Chinese]. So any generalizations made about BC will not hold for every text.As such, the earliest translations like Zhi Qian and Dharmarakṣa are different in many ways to those of Kumarajiva and also to those of Xuanzang and his followers, who had different translation philosophies and ways of translating key terms and phrases. And all of these works are significantly different than the vernacular Chinese compositions found in genres like “sutra lectures” (jiang jingwen 講經文), baihua shi 白話詩 “vernacular poems” and the Chan yulu 語錄 “recorded sayings” literature.

==Editions and contents==

The various editions of the Chinese Buddhist canon all include translations of Indian Āgama, Vinaya and Abhidharma texts from the Early Buddhist schools, as well as translations of the Mahāyāna sūtras, &quot;śāstras&quot; (treatises) and scriptures from Indian Esoteric Buddhism. The various canons also contain texts composed in China, Korea and Japan, including apocryphal sutras and Chinese Buddhist treatises. These additional non-Indic works include philosophical treatises, commentaries, philological works, catalogues, sectarian writings, geographic works, travelogues, biographies, genealogies and hagiographies, encyclopedias and dictionaries. Furthermore, each edition of the canon has its own organizational schema, with different divisions for the various types of texts.

The development of the Buddhist canons also saw the development of other supplemental texts, including textual catalogues and lexicographical works. Catalogues contained much information about the texts in the canon, including how it was translated, its content and its textual history and authenticity (whether a text which claims to be Indian was actually Indian or not). Dictionaries were also important supplements to the various canons, explaining difficult terms and names found in the various texts of the canon. One influential example was Huilin&#x27;s &quot;Sounds and Meanings of the Canon&quot; (c. 810), which explains the meanings of 6,000 characters. 

The earliest manuscript canon may have been compiled as early as the later fifth or early sixth century. While the Kaibao Canon is the earliest printed canon (completed c. 983), it is the Zhaocheng Jin Tripitaka, which dates to the Jin dynasty (1115–1234), that is the earliest Tripitaka collection that survives intact. While more than twenty different woodblock canons were carved in China throughout the history of Chinese Buddhism, the Goryeo Tripitaka and the Qianlong Tripitaka are the only collections which have survived as complete woodblock printing sets. All other woodblock canons were fully or partially lost and destroyed in wars. 

Regarding the printed canons, they are all part of three “text families” or “lineages” of canons which borrow from previous editions in content, format, organization and carving style. According to Chikusa Masaaki and Fang Guangchang, all printed canons can be grouped into three main textual systems: &quot;the tradition of central China based on Kaibao Canon, the northern tradition based on Khitan Canon, and the southern tradition based on Chongning Canon&quot;. 

=== Kaibao canon ===
The first printed version of the Chinese Buddhist canon was Song dynasty Kaibao Canon (開寶藏) also known as the Shu-pen (蜀本) or Sichuan edition (since it was printed in Sichuan province). It was printed on the order of Emperor Taizu of Song (r. 960–976) and the work of printing the whole canon lasted from 971 to 983. This canon comprised 5,048 fascicles and 1,076 titles, only 14 fascicles from this canon survive today. 

The blocks used to print the Kaibao Canon were lost in the fall of the Northern Song capital Kaifeng in 1127 and there are only about twelve fascicles worth of surviving material. However, the Kaibao formed the basis for future printed versions that do survive intact. Most importantly, the Kaibao (along with later editions like the Liao dynasty edition) was the main source for the Tripitaka Koreana, which in turn was the basis for the modern Taisho edition. It was also the main source for the Zhaocheng Canon. As such, the Kaibao has been one of the most influential canons in Chinese history. 

=== Liao Khitan Canon ===
The Liao Canon 遼藏 or Khitan Canon 契丹藏 was printed in the Liao Dynasty (916–1125) during the reign of Emperor Shengzong (983–1031), shortly after the printing of the Kaibao Canon. It followed a different manuscript tradition than the Kaibao. It had 1,414 titles and 6,054 fascicles. 

=== Chongning Canon and the Southern canons ===
After the Song government lost their war with the Jin dynasty and moved to the south in 1127, Buddhists in southern China worked to make new editions of the canon. This resulted in the Chongning Canon produced in Fuzhou and completed in 1112. This canon was based on a different manuscript canon than the one that had been used to carve the Kaibao Canon. The Chongning Canon became the basis for later canons like the Song era Pilu Canon 毗盧藏, the Sixi Canon 思溪藏 (including the Yuanjue Canon and Zifu Canon) and the Qisha Canon as well as the Yuan era Puning Canon 普寧藏 and the Japanese Tokugawa period Tenkai Canon 天海藏. The Qisha canon was particularly unique because it was produced not by the state but by private funding and effort, continuing the southern tradition of printed canons. 

=== Korean canon ===
The earliest edition of the Korean canon or &quot;Tripiṭaka Koreana&quot; (&quot;Koryŏ Taejanggyōng&quot; 高麗大藏經), also known as the &quot;Palman Daejanggyeong&quot; (80,000 Tripitaka), was first carved in the 11th century during the Goryeo period (918–1392). The first edition was completely destroyed by the Mongols in 1232 and thus a second set was carved from 1236 to 1251 during the reign of Gojong (1192–1259). 

This second Korean canon was carved into 81,258 woodblocks. According to Lewis R. Lancaster &quot;each was carved on both sides with twenty-three lines of fourteen characters each. The calligraphy was excellent and the layout such that all the characters appeared in large size. The blocks measured two feet three inches in length and nearly ten inches in width and more than an inch in thickness. A very hard and durable wood from the &quot;Betula schmidtii regal&quot; tree (known as &quot;Paktal&quot; in Korean), gathered on the islands off the coast, was used.&quot; 

These woodblocks were kept in good condition until the modern era, and are seen as accurate sources for the classic Chinese Buddhist Canon. Today, the woodblocks are stored at the Haeinsa temple, in South Korea. 

The main texts in this canon are divided into main sections: a Mahāyāna Tripiṭaka and a Hīnayāna Tripiṭaka, each one having the three classic sub-divisions of Sūtra, Vinaya, and Abhidharma. There are also supplementary sections with texts of East Asian provenance. 

The contents of the Korean Canon (which follows the organization of Zhisheng&#x27;s &quot;Kaiyuan Catalogue&quot;) are as follows: 

* 大乘三藏 Mahāyāna Tripiṭaka
**大乘經 Mahāyāna Sūtra
***般若部 Prajñāpāramitā (1–21)
***寶積部 Ratnakūṭa (22–55)
***大集部 Mahāsannipāta (56–78)
***華嚴部 Avataṃsaka (79–104)
***涅槃部 Parinirvāṇa (105–110)
***五大部外諸重譯經 Other Major Sūtras (111–387)
***單譯經 Minor Sūtras (388–522) 
**大乘律 Mahāyāna Vinaya (523–548)
**大乘論 Mahāyāna Abhidharma
***釋經論 Sūtra Commentaries (549–569)
***集義論 Collected Treatises (570–646)
*小乘三藏 Hīnayāna Tripiṭaka
**小乘經 Hīnayāna Sūtra
***阿含部 Āgama (647–800)
***單譯經 Minor Sūtras (801–888)
**小乘律 Hīnayāna Vinaya (889–942)
**小乘論 Hīnayāna Abhidharma (943–978)
*賢聖傳記錄 Records of the Noble Ones
**西土賢聖集 Sages of the West (979–1046)
**此土撰述 Writings of This Land (1047–1087)
*宋續入藏經 Song Period and Later Additions (1088–1498)

=== Zhaocheng Jin Canon ===

The Jin Dynasty Zhaocheng Canon 趙城藏 (also known as the Jin Canon 金藏) was based on the Kaibao Canon. 

The blocks were carved between 1149 and 1178, a project led by the nun Cui Fazhen 崔法珍. This canon contains 1,576 titles in 6,980 fascicles. The woodblocks were originally stored at Hongfa Monastery in Beijing. This canon was supplemented various times during the Yuan dynasty. Copies of this canon were also distributed in Shanxi under the auspices of Kublai Khan (1215–1294).

One of these copies of the Jin Canon (containing about 4,800 fascicles) was re-discovered in 1933 at Guangsheng Temple, Zhaocheng County, Shanxi (hence the name Zhaocheng canon). This canon was used as the basis for the modern Chinese Tripitaka compiled and published in the 1980s.

=== Japanese canons ===

The Buddhist canon, known as the &quot;Issaikyō&quot; (一切經, lit. &quot;the entirety of the scriptures&quot;) in Japanese, also played an important role in the history of Japanese Buddhism. The canon was first chanted in 651 at a royal palace and in 673, Emperor Tenmu ordered the &quot;Issaikyō&quot; to be copied in full. During the Nara period (710-794), the imperial government led a large-scale copying of the &quot;Issaikyō&quot; at Tōdaiji. At least twenty nine manuscript canons were copied during the Nara period and many manuscripts from this period have survived. In the following eras, the canon was widely copied and maintained at various temple libraries and repositories, often with support from the government or important nobles. Some early important libraries included the collection at Nanatsudera 七寺 (in Nagoya) and the library at Bonshakuji. 

These collections were often used for rituals in which the sutras were recited, an act which was seen as bringing merit and protecting the state. This practice was called tendoku (転読) and is discussed by &quot;Nihon shoki&quot; 日本書紀, an important 8th century history book. A full manuscript set of the &quot;Issaikyō&quot; copied between 1175 and 1180 survives in Nanatsu-dera temple. It has been declared a National Treasure of Japan and an Important Cultural Property. Modern scholars have discovered that several manuscripts in this canon were based on old Nara era manuscripts which preserve pre-Song dynasty readings. 
The practice of copying Buddhist scriptures led to a new class of scribes, the standardization of textual production as well as the rise of manuscript art. Some copies of the canon were lavishly decorated, like the Jingo-ji Tripiṭaka&quot;,&quot; commissioned by Emperor Toba and Emperor Go-Shirakawa from 1150-1185. This canon was written in golden ink on 5400 scrolls of Indigo dyed paper.

Block-printing in large scale arrived relatively late to Japan. It was only during the Edo Period, in the 17th Century that the Japanese produced a printed canon, the Tenkai Edition (天海版) which was completed in 1648 and was based on a Yuan Dynasty edition. Its production was sponsored by Tokugawa Iemitsu (1623–51) and led by the influential monk Tenkai (1534–1643). Before this time, Japanese Buddhists relied on hand copied texts or printed copies imported from the mainland. 

A later edition, known as the Ōbaku Canon 黃檗藏 (or Tetsugen Canon 鐵眼藏 ), was begun in 1667 by a monk of the Ōbaku school named Tetsugen who set up a print shop in Kyoto. The Ōbaku Canon, a reprint of the Chinese Jiaxing Canon, was the most important edition of the canon in Japan until the modern creation of the Taisho canon.

=== Yongle northern canon ===

The Yongle Northern Tripiṭaka (&quot;yongle beizang&quot; 永樂北藏), named after the Yongle Emperor, was the most important canon carved in the Ming dynasty (1368 to 1644). It was carved in the new capital of Beijing from 1419 to 1440. This canon was very similar to a previous Ming era Yongle canon, called the Yongle Southern Canon (Yongle nanzang 永樂南藏, c. 1413 to 1420). 

The Yongle canons were the first canons to merge all the texts into a single set of pitakas. Previous canons like the Korean canon had followed the older schema of having two main divisions of &quot;Hīnayāna&quot; and Mahāyāna sections (each with separate sub-divisions for the Sūtra, Vinaya, and Abhidharma texts of each yana). The Yongle canons however merged all these texts into a single collection of Sūtra, Vinaya, and Abhidharma (which sub-divisions for Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna). 

As such, the structure of the Yongle Northern canon was as follows: 
* Sūtra Piṭaka
**Hīnayāna Sūtra 
**Mahāyāna Sūtra 
**Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna Sūtras added to the canon during the Song and Yuan dynasties
* Vinaya Piṭaka
**Hīnayāna Vinaya
**Mahāyāna Vinaya
* Abhidharma Piṭaka
**Hīnayāna Abhidharma
**Mahāyāna Abhidharma
**Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna Abhidharma texts added to the canon during the Song and Yuan dynasties
* Miscellaneous works
**Works of the Sages and Wise men of the Western Country (India)
**Works of this country (China)
**Chinese works added to the canon in the Ming dynasty
This canon was also influential outside of China, as it was re-printed in Japan under the auspices of Tetsugen Doko (1630–1682), a renowned master of the Ōbaku school.

The Yongle canons became the basis for later canons, including the Jiaxing Canon (Jiaxing zang 嘉興藏 or Jingshan zang 徑山藏) of the late Ming and early Qing as well as the later Qing Canon (Qing zang). This canon was also influential outside of China, as it was re-printed in Japan under the auspices of Tetsugen Doko (1630–1682), a renowned master of the Ōbaku school.

=== Qianlong canon ===
The &quot;Qianlong Dazangjing&quot; (乾隆大藏經) also known as the Longzang (龍藏 “Dragon Store”) or the &quot;Qing Canon&quot; (清藏) was produced in Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) between the 13th year of Yongzheng (1735 CE) and the third year of the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1738 CE). The edition of the Buddhist canon, based on the Yongle, contains 1,675 titles in 7,240 fascicles and survives in a complete set of woodblocks (79,036 blocks). It is the last canon printed in the traditional style (without any punctuation or modern typography) and the best preserved of the classic Chinese Tripitakas in China. 

=== Taishō canon ===

The Taishō Tripiṭaka (&quot;taishō shinshū daizōkyō&quot; 大正新脩大藏經) is one of the most influential modern editions, being widely used by modern scholars. Led by Junjiro Takakusu, Kaigyoku Watanabe, and Ono Genmyo, over 300 Japanese scholars worked on compiling the Taishō from 1922–1934 and a total number of 450,000 people worked on the project. The project cost 2.8 million Japanese yen.

Named after the Taishō era of Japanese history, a modern standardized edition was published in Tokyo between 1924 and 1934 in 100 volumes. It is one of the first editions of the canon with modern punctuation and also scholarly notes. 

The main section of the Taishō (the section that contains the traditional contents of the Chinese Buddhist Canon) has fifty-five volumes and 2,184 texts. The main section of the Taishō mostly consists of copies of the second edition of the Korean (Koryŏ) canon. These texts were checked and collated with various other canons, such as those housed at Zōjō-ji temple (which houses the Sixi Canon made in the Song, and the Puning Canon from the Yuan), with the Ming era Jiaxing Canon and with the Chongning Canon and Pilu Canon stored at the Library of the Imperial Household (Kunai-shō). The Japanese scholars also referenced the Pali canon and Sanskrit manuscripts. Some texts which were missing from the Koryŏ canon were also added from other sources such as Japanese collections or other Chinese canons. 

The Taishō editors also compiled catalogues, an index, and a glossary. The Taishō scholars also provided scholarly annotations that contain alternate readings from other sources, though it was not a true critical edition of the Chinese canon. It also contained punctuation marks not found in the earlier canons, though they are often mistaken. 

The Taishō canon was also revolutionary in the way it organized the canonical texts. It abandoned the traditional canonical schemas of organization which date back to the Kaiyuan catalogue. Instead, the Taisho was organized into the following categories based on the historical development of Buddhist texts: 

# Āgamas (equivalent to the contents of the Pali Sutta Piṭaka, vols 1-2)
# Biographies of Buddha and his disciples, Jātakas (vols 3-4).
# Mahāyāna Sūtras, grouped into the six sections (627 texts in thirteen vols.): 
##Prajñaparamita (vols 5-8).
##Lotus Sūtra (vol. 9)
##Avatamsaka (vols 9-10)
##Ratnakūta (vol. 11)
##Mahāparinirvāna (vol. 12)
##Mahā-sannipāta (vol. 13)
# General ‘Sūtras’ (mostly Mahāyāna) (vol. 14-17)
# Esoteric Texts Section (572 texts, vols 18-21).
# Vinayas (monastic rules) and some texts outlining Mahayana bodhisattvas ethics (eighty-six texts in three vols. 22-24).
# Indian commentaries on the Āgamas and Mahāyāna Sūtras (thirty-one texts in three vols. 24-26).
# Abhidharma (non-Mahayana Abhidharma) texts (twenty-eight scholastic Buddhist texts in four vols. 26-29).
# Mādhyamaka (vol. 30)
# Yogācāra (vol. 31)
# Collected Treatises (vol. 32)
# Chinese Sutra commentaries (twelve vols. 33-39).
# Chinese Vinaya commentaries (vol. 40)
# Chinese commentaries on treatises (vols 40-44)

The Supplementary section of the canon contains further texts including: 
# Schools and Lineages section (vols 44-48)
# History and Biography section (vols 49-52) 
# Sourcebook section, with dictionaries etc (vols 53-54)
# Non-Buddhist Teachings section (Hindu, Manichaean, and Nestorian Christian works) (vol 54) 
# Catalogues section (vol 55) 

Furthermore there are more sections for supplementary content by Japanese authors (30 volumes), supplementary sections of extra sutra, vinaya and sastra commentaries, a supplementary section on schools and lineages, a supplementary section for liturgical texts in Siddham script, a section for Dunhuang texts, a section for lost ancient texts, suspected texts and twelve volumes of iconographical content. 

=== Zhonghua Dazangjing ===
The Zhonghua Dazangjing (中華大藏經), also called the Tripitaka Sinica, is a modern edition of the Chinese canon developed by Chinese scholars. The project was led Professor Ren Jiyu 任繼愈 (1916–2009) between 1984 and 1996 and sponsored by the Chinese state. This edition was based on the Zhaocheng jinzang canon (趙城金藏), and made use of eight other editions like the Korean Tripitaka for proofreading and adding sections missing from the Zhaocheng copies. 

The original goal of the project was to include many texts not included in many of the traditional canons, such as texts preserved in Fangshan Stone Canon and the supplementary sections of other canons like the Jiaxing, Pinjia, Puhui, and the Taisho. In 1994, the main section of the canon was completed, including 1,937 titles in 10,230 fascicles. 

The planned supplementary sections were later undertaken by other projects. The &quot;Chinese Manuscripts in the Tripitaka Sinica&quot; (中華大藏經–漢文部份 &quot;Zhonghua Dazangjing: Hanwen bufen&quot;), a new collection of canonical texts, was published by Zhonghua Book Company in Beijing in 1983–97, with 107 volumes of literature, are photocopies of early manuscripts, and include many newly unearthed scriptures from Dunhuang. There are also newer Tripitaka Sinica projects.

=== Electronic editions ===

The Taishō Tripiṭaka became the basis for electronic editions of the Chinese Buddhist canon. The two main projects currently available online for free are the SAT Daizōkyō Text Database and the Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association (CBETA). There is also a project in South Korea to digitize the Tripitaka Koreana. The digitization of these canons became possible with the expansion of Unicode Character encoding standard to include many ancient Chinese characters. These digital editions also contain the ability to conduct a search of the entire database. 

The digital editions of the canon have also seen further improvements of the texts from previous printed editions. For example, when the Taisho Canon was first printed, many old characters found in the Tripitaka Koreana (the main source of the Taisho) were not available to the original Taisho Canon typesetters, who thus had to choose alternative Chinese characters. The new electronic editions of the Taisho have allowed for easier restoration of the original characters as Unicode expanded its base of Chinese characters.

=== Supplemental material ===

Numerous collections of supplemental texts which are not found in the main traditional canonical editions have been published by modern scholars as part of modern collections of the canon or as supplemental volumes. Perhaps the most well known are the supplemental volumes to the Taishō Canon which include Japanese Buddhist works, Dunhuang texts, illustrations and so forth. 

The use of old catalogues is an important supplement to the study of the Chinese Buddhist canon, its history and lost editions. The most famous and influential catalog that is included in the Taishō is the &quot;Kaiyuan Shijiao Lu&quot; 開元釋教錄 (Taisho no. 2154). Other catalogs are included in Volume 55.

The &quot;Xuzangjing&quot; (卍續藏) version, which is a supplement of another version of the canon, is often used as a supplement for Buddhist texts not collected in the &quot;&quot;. The &quot;Jiaxing Tripitaka&quot; is another supplement for Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty Buddhist texts, and as well as the &quot;Dazangjing Bu Bian&quot; (大藏經補編) published in 1986.

==== Dunhuang texts ====
The manuscript finds at Dunhuang contain numerous Buddhist texts in Chinese and in other languages like Tibetan and Old Uyghur which are either not in the main Chinese canon or are significantly different versions. Most these texts are no later than the 11th century, the date of the closing of the largest trove of texts found in the so-called Library Cave (Cave 17). These finds have been influential on modern East Asian Buddhist scholarship and are an important supplement to the study of East Asian Buddhist texts found in the main canonical collections. The Dunhuang texts have been published by different modern scholarly projects.

==== Non-collected works ====

A number of apocryphal sutras and texts composed in China are excluded from the main collections of the canon. These Chinese works include sutras like &quot;High King Avalokiteshvara Sutra&quot; and other texts, some of which are important to Chinese folk religions. Some of these works can be found in supplementary volumes to the different editions of the canon.

== Translations ==


In the medieval period, several translations of Chinese Buddhist texts were made into other languages by various groups within the Chinese Buddhist sphere of influence. In the modern era, the contents of the Chinese canon were also translated into modern languages like Korean, Japanese and English.

=== Uyghur Buddhist texts ===
From the 11th to the 14th centuries, Uyghur Buddhism thrived especially in Qocho, Beshbaliq and Ganzhou regions. Uyghur Buddhists made many translations into Old Uyghur. Many of these texts have survived.

=== Tangut Tripitaka ===
The Mi Tripitaka (蕃大藏經) is a full Buddhist canon translated into the Tangut language from Chinese sources. This canon was the main source for the Buddhism of the Tangut people of the Western Xia dynasty (1038–1227). Today, this canon is studied by a small group of scholars who work in the field of Tangutology. Eric Grinstead published a collection of Tangut Buddhist texts under the title &quot;The Tangut Tripitaka&quot; in 1971 in New Delhi. 

=== Manchu Canon ===
The Qianlong Emperor (1711–1799) had the Chinese Buddhist canon translated into the Manchu language during his reign. This Qing dynasty translation of the canon is known as the Manchu Canon (ch. Qingwen fanyi dazangjing 清文繙譯大藏經, mnc. Manju gisun i ubiliyambuga amba kanjur nomun). The project involved more than 90 scholars working for 20 years. The sutras were translated from the Qianlong edition of the Chinese canon but the Vinaya texts were actually translated from the Tibetan canon. 

=== Modern translations ===
The &quot;Goryeo&quot; canon has been translated in full into modern Korean. The Taisho canon was also translated in full into modern Japanese during the 20th century under the auspices of Takakusu Junjiro and other Japanese Buddhist scholars. Many sutras and treatises have been translated into English by various scholars, but many works remain untranslated into English. In 1965, Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai (Society for the Promotion of Buddhism, BDK) was founded by Dr Yehan Numata with the express goal of translating the entire canon into English.

<text>Decimal Day () in the United Kingdom and in Ireland was Monday 15 February 1971, the day on which each country decimalised its respective £sd currency of pounds, shillings, and pence.

Before this date, both the British pound sterling and the Irish pound (symbol &quot;£&quot;) were subdivided into 20 shillings, each of 12 (old) pence, a total of 240 pence. With decimalisation, the pound kept its old value and name in each currency, but the shilling was abolished, and the pound was divided into 100 new pence (abbreviated to &quot;p&quot;). In the UK, the new coins initially featured the word “new”, but in due course this was dropped. Each new penny was worth 2.4 old pence (&quot;d.&quot;) in each currency. 

Coins of half a new penny were introduced in the UK and in Ireland to maintain the approximate granularity of the old penny, but these were dropped in the UK in 1984 and in Ireland on 1 January 1987 as inflation reduced their value. An old value of 7 pounds, 10 shillings, and sixpence, abbreviated £7-10-6 or , became . Amounts with a number of old pence which was not 0 or 6 did not convert into a round number of new pence.

===Background===

The Russian ruble was the first decimal currency to be used in Europe, dating to 1704, though China had been using a decimal system for at least 2000 years. Elsewhere, the Coinage Act of 1792 introduced decimal currency to the United States, the first English-speaking country to adopt a decimalised currency. In France, the decimal French franc was introduced in 1795.

Before the 1970s, earlier efforts in the United Kingdom to introduce decimalised currency had failed; in 1824, the United Kingdom Parliament rejected Sir John Wrottesley&#x27;s proposals to decimalise sterling, which were prompted by the introduction of the French franc three decades earlier. Following this, little progress towards decimalisation was made in the United Kingdom for over a century, with the exception of the two shilling silver florin, first issued on 1849, worth of a pound. A double florin or four shilling piece, introduced in 1887, was a further step towards decimalisation, but failed to gain acceptance and was struck only between 1887 and 1890.

Though little further progress was made, The Decimal Association, founded in 1841 to promote decimalisation and metrication, saw interest in both causes boosted by a growing national realisation of the importance of ease in international trade, following the 1851 Great Exhibition; it was as a result of the growing interest in decimalisation that the florin was issued. In a preliminary report issued in 1857 by the Royal Commission on Decimal Coinage, the benefits and drawbacks of decimalisation were considered, but the report failed to draw any conclusions on the adoption of a change in currency. A final report in 1859 from the two remaining commissioners, Lord Overstone and Governor of the Bank of England John Hubbard, came out against the idea, claiming that it had &quot;few merits&quot;.

In 1862, the &quot;Select committee on Weights and Measures&quot; favoured the introduction of decimalisation to accompany the introduction of metric weights and measures.

The &quot;Royal Commission on Decimal Coinage&quot; (1918–1920), chaired by Lord Emmott, reported in 1920 that the only feasible scheme was to divide the pound into 1,000 mills (the &quot;pound and mill&quot; system, first proposed in 1824), but that it would be too inconvenient to introduce. A minority of four members said that the disruption would be worthwhile. A further three members recommended that the pound should be replaced by the royal, consisting of 100 halfpennies, with there then being 4.8 royals to the former pound.


In 1960, a report prepared jointly by the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, followed by the success of decimalisation in South Africa, prompted the Government to set up the &quot;Committee of the Inquiry on Decimal Currency&quot; (Halsbury Committee) in 1961, which reported in 1963. The adoption of the changes suggested in the report was announced on 1 March 1966. The Decimal Currency Board (DCB) was created to manage the transition, but the plans were only approved by Parliament with the Decimal Currency Act 1967 (c. 47). The former Greater London Council leader Bill Fiske was named as the Chairman of the Decimal Currency Board.

Consideration was given to introducing a new major unit of currency worth ten shillings in the old currency. Suggested names included the &quot;new pound&quot;, the &quot;royal&quot; and the &quot;noble&quot;. It would have resulted in the &quot;decimal penny&quot; being worth only slightly more than the old penny, an approach adopted in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand in the 1960s, adopting respectively the South African rand, Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar equal in value to 10 shillings. However, Halsbury decided that the pound sterling&#x27;s importance as a reserve currency meant that the pound should remain unchanged.

===Preparation===

Under the new system, the pound was retained, but was divided into 100 new pence, denoted by the symbol &quot;p&quot;. New coinage was issued alongside the old coins. The 5p and 10p coins were introduced in April 1968 and were the same size, composition and value as the shilling and two shilling coins in circulation with them. In October 1969, the 50p coin was introduced, with the 10s. note withdrawn on 20 November 1970. This reduced the number of new coins required to be introduced on Decimal Day, meaning that the British public would already be familiar with three of the six new coins. Small booklets were made available, containing some or all of the new denominations.

The old halfpenny was withdrawn from circulation on 31 July 1969, and the half-crown (2s. 6d.) followed on 31 December to ease the transition. The farthing, last minted in 1956, had already ceased to be legal tender in 1961.

A substantial publicity campaign took place in the weeks before Decimal Day, including a song by Max Bygraves called &quot;Decimalisation&quot;. The BBC broadcast a series of five-minute programmes, titled &quot;Decimal Five&quot;, to which The Scaffold contributed some specially written tunes. ITV repeatedly broadcast a short drama called &quot;Granny Gets The Point&quot; starring Doris Hare, in which an elderly woman who does not understand the new system is taught to use it by her grandson. At 10 a.m. on 15 February and again the following week, BBC 1 broadcast &#x27;New Money Day&#x27;, a &quot;Merry-Go Round&quot; schools&#x27; programme in which puppet maker Peter Firmin and his small friend Muskit encountered different prices and new coins when they visited the shops.

Banks received stocks of the new coins in advance, which were issued to retailers shortly before Decimal Day to enable them to give change immediately after the changeover. Banks were closed from 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday 10 February 1971 to 10:00 a.m. on Monday 15 February to enable all outstanding cheques and credits in the clearing system to be processed and customers&#x27; account balances to be converted from £sd to decimal. In many banks, the conversion was done manually, as few bank branches were then computerised. February had been chosen for Decimal Day because it was the quietest time of the year for the banks, shops and transport organisations.

Many items were priced in both currencies for some time before and after the change. Prior to Decimal Day, items priced in both currencies had displayed the price in predecimalised currency first, with the price in decimal currency last in parentheses. From Decimal Day onwards, this order was reversed, with decimal currency presented first, and predecimal currency last in parentheses; for example, &quot;1s (5p)&quot; would become &quot;5p (1s)&quot;. This latter order was used on most football programmes during the 1970–71 season. High-denomination (10p, 20p and 50p) stamps were issued on 17 June 1970. Post offices were issued with simplified training stamps in the same colours as the upcoming decimal stamps.

Exceptions to the 15 February introduction of decimalisation were British Rail and London Transport, which had gone decimal one day early, the former urging customers, if they chose to use pennies or threepenny pieces, to pay them in multiples of 6d (p, the lowest common multiple of the two systems).

Conversion tables were provided, showing how prices in £sd rounded to the new currency: this including saying 3d was equivalent to 1p though 9d was equivalent to 4p. This led to some anomalies: school meals were charged at 1s 9d a day or 8s 9d for a five-day week; these became 9p a day or 45p a week despite the conversion tables suggesting 8s 9d should be 44p.

===After Decimal Day===
Because of extensive preparations and the publicity campaigns organised by the British government, Decimal Day itself went smoothly. Some criticism – such as the fact that the new halfpenny coin was relatively small, and that some traders had taken advantage of the transition to raise their prices – were levelled, despite the fact that in the latter case, overall price adjustments slightly favoured the consumer. Some used new pennies as sixpences in vending machines. After 15 February, shops continued to accept payment in old coins but always issued change in new coins. The old coins were then returned to banks, and so most of them were quickly taken out of circulation.

The new halfpenny, penny, and twopence coins were introduced on 15 February 1971. Within two weeks of Decimal Day, the old penny (1d) and old threepence (3d) coins had left circulation, and old sixpences had become somewhat rare. On 31 August 1971, the 1/2d, 1d and 3d were officially withdrawn from circulation, ending the transition period to decimal currency.

The government intended that in speech, the new units would be called &quot;new pence&quot;; however, the British public quickly began to refer to pennies as &quot;pee&quot; when shortened, with &quot;10p&quot; pronounced as &quot;ten pee&quot; instead of &quot;ten new pence&quot;. Other shortenings previously common, such as &quot;tuppence&quot;, were now rarely heard, and terms such as &quot;tanner&quot; (used for the silver sixpence), which previously designated amounts of money, were no longer used. However, some slang terms, such as &quot;quid&quot; and &quot;bob&quot;, previously used for pounds and shillings respectively, survived from predecimal times. Amounts denominated in guineas (21s or £1.05) were reserved still for specialist transactions, and continued to be used in the sale of horses and at some auctions, amongst others.

The public information campaign over the preceding two years helped, as well as the trick of getting a rough conversion of new pence into old shillings and pence by simply doubling the number of new pence and placing a solidus, or slash, between the digits: 17p multiplied by 2 = 34, – approximately equal to 3/4 (&quot;three and four&quot;, or three shillings and four pence), with a similar process for the reverse conversion. The willingness of Britain&#x27;s younger population to embrace decimalisation also helped, with elderly people having greater difficulty in adapting; the phrase &quot;How much is that in old money?&quot;, or even &quot;How much is that in real money?&quot; became associated with those who struggled with the change, before in the following decades coming to refer to conversions between metric and imperial weights and measures. In shops from Decimal Day onwards, new stock would be universally priced in &#x27;new money&#x27;, though in smaller shops such as newsagents, it was still possible to find stock priced in £sd for several years after 1971; however, remaining stock priced in £sd would still be charged in its equivalent in decimal currency.

Around Decimal Day, &quot;Decimal Adders&quot; and other converters were available to help people convert between the old and new coins. The following is a table showing conversions between the decimal and pre-decimal systems.

=== Response to decimalisation ===
In response to the change, some new coins were stamped with phrases such as &quot;DUD&quot;.
===Validity of old coins===

All predecimal coins, except for certain non-circulating coins such as crowns, sovereigns and double florins which were explicitly excluded from demonetisation, are now no longer legal tender. Several other pre-decimal coins remained in circulation beyond 1971 (see below) however they are all now withdrawn following changes to the standards and specifications of circulating coinage.

===Sixpences===
The sixpence (6d), worth exactly p, was withdrawn in June 1980. This enabled the withdrawal of the decimal half-penny coin in 1984.

===Shillings and florins===
Shillings and florins, together with their same sized 5p and 10p coin equivalents, coexisted in circulation as valid currency until the early 1990s. In theory, this would have included coins dating back to 1816, but in practice, the oldest were dated 1947, as older coins contained silver, meaning the value of their metal was worth more than their nominal value. 

The coins were withdrawn when smaller 5p and 10p coins were introduced in 1990 and 1992 respectively. The demonetisation of the larger-size 50p in 1998 means that there are now no sterling coins in everyday circulation dated earlier than 1971.

===Maundy money===
The face value of Maundy money coins was maintained, increasing all their face values by a factor of 2.4, as the coins continued to be legal tender as new pence. The numismatic value of each coin, though, greatly exceeds face value.

===Commemorative issues===
Commemorative &#x27;decimal&#x27; Crowns dated 1972, 1977, 1980 and 1981 remain legal tender (with a face value of 25p) as do the £5 coins issued from 1990 onwards.

===Subsequent changes===
The decimal halfpenny (p), which had been introduced in 1971, remained in circulation until 1984, when its value had been greatly reduced by inflation. It was not struck, save for collectors&#x27; sets, following 1983, with those dated 1984 struck only as proofs, or in uncirculated mint sets. The decimal halfpenny was demonetised on 31 December 1984. The 50p piece was reduced in size in 1997, following the reduction in size of the 5p in 1990 and the 10p in 1992 (the large versions of all the three have been demonetised). The 1p and 2p underwent a compositional change from bronze to plated steel in 1992. However, both coins remain valid back to 1971, the only circulating coins on Decimal Day that are still valid.

In 1982, the word &quot;new&quot; in &quot;new penny&quot; or &quot;new pence&quot; was removed from the inscriptions on coins, and was replaced by the number of pence in the denomination (for example, &quot;ten pence&quot; or &quot;fifty pence&quot;). This coincided with the introduction of a new 20p coin, which from the outset bore simply the legend &quot;twenty pence&quot;.

A £1 coin was introduced into circulation in 1983, and a £2 coin in 1998 (although a series of commemorative uni-metallic £2 coins had been issued between 1986 and 1996 to celebrate special occasions).

==Republic of Ireland==

When the old £sd system (consisting of pounds, shillings, and pence) was in operation, the United Kingdom and Ireland operated within the sterling area, effectively a single monetary area. The Irish pound was created as a separate currency in 1927 with distinct coins and notes, but the terms of the Currency Act 1927 obliged the Irish currency commissioners to redeem Irish pounds on a fixed 1:1 basis, and so day-to-day banking operations continued exactly as they had been before the creation of the Irish pound. The Irish pound was decimalised on 15 February 1971, the same date as the British pound.

This arrangement continued until 1979 when Irish obligations to the European Monetary System led to Ireland breaking the historic link with sterling.

In Ireland, all pre-decimal coins, except the 1 &quot;s.&quot;, 2 &quot;s.&quot; and 10 &quot;s.&quot; coins, were called in during the initial process between 1969 and 1972; the ten shilling coin, which, as recently issued and in any event equivalent to 50p, was permitted to remain outstanding (though due to silver content, the coin did not circulate widely). The 1 &quot;s.&quot; and 2 &quot;s.&quot; were recalled in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Pre-decimal Irish coins may still be redeemed at their face value equivalent in euros at the Central Bank in Dublin.

Pre-decimal Irish coins were denoted with &quot;s&quot; for shillings and &quot;d&quot; for pence, abbreviations derived from the Latin &quot;solidi&quot; and &quot;denarii&quot;, in contrast to stamps, which instead bore Irish-language abbreviations (&quot;scilling&quot; (&quot;shilling&quot;, abbreviated &quot;s&quot;) and &quot;pingin&quot; (&quot;penny&quot;, abbreviated &quot;p&quot;)). After decimalisation, coins were marked with the Irish-language abbreviations. While British stamps switched from &#x27;d&#x27; to &#x27;p&#x27;, Irish stamps (unlike the coins) printed the number with no accompanying letter; so a stamp worth 2 new pence was marked &#x27;2p&#x27; in the UK and simply &#x27;2&#x27; in Ireland.

The following is a table showing conversions between the Irish decimal and pre-decimal systems. It was similar to the British one, except for the higher-value coins.

Ireland&#x27;s new decimal coinage had face values of p, 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p and 50p.

The old shilling coin continued to circulate with a value of 5 new pence, and the old florin with a value of 10 new pence. Unlike in the UK, where the sixpence continued to circulate at a value of p, the Irish sixpence was withdrawn from circulation after decimalisation. The ten-shilling note was withdrawn from circulation, but the other Series A banknotes continued in use.
===Subsequent changes===

A twenty-pence coin was introduced in 1986. The decimal halfpenny (p) remained in circulation until 1987, when its value had been greatly reduced by inflation. Very few were produced after the initial minting.

In 1990, the pound coin was introduced, and in 1992 the 5p and 10p coins were reduced in size. The old shilling and florin coins ceased to be legal tender at the same time.

The Irish pound coins were withdrawn from circulation in 2002, to be replaced by the euro.

<doc id="521603" wikidata="Q932768" url="?curid=521603" title="Vivant">
<text>Vivant is a small social-liberal political party in Belgium founded by millionaire Roland Duchâtelet. In the regional elections in June 2004, the party formed a strategic alliance with the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD). Both parties are founded on the principle of individualism and can be called liberal. In 2007, the party announced it would likely merge with the VLD.

Vivant is economically interventionist, advocating a basic income guarantee for all citizens. Vivant considers the basic income as an inalienable part of the legal minimum wage (approximately half of it for full-time employment). In order to tax goods more evenly, wherever they are manufactured in order to respond to automatisation, globalization and an ageing population, Vivant proposes to shift taxes from labour to final consumption. (All taxes in the chain of production are an inclusive part of the price paid by the consumers and could be considered as a consumption tax, each tax in each stage with its specific side effects.) 

Vivant also proposes a flat tax on income in two steps, 0% on to 1350 Euro and 50% from there. The VLD doesn&#x27;t support all of these measures. Vivant also has direct democracy as one of its key points. The main goal of the party and its universal income proposal, is a creation of an extensive welfare system. The party seeks a &quot;more effective struggle against poverty and exclusion, the end of stigmatizing controls on beneficiaries, and an effective way of suppressing unemployment traps.&quot;

In the regional elections of 2004, partner VLD lost heavily, dragging Vivant with it to third place among Flemish political parties. Although interest in Vivant increased during the elections, the party remained a marginal force in Belgian politics. Vivant is particularly strong in the German-speaking community of Belgium, where it won 7.3% and two representatives in the Parliament of the German community.

While &quot;vivant&quot; means &quot;alive&quot; or &quot;lively&quot; in French, as an acronym &quot;VIVANT&quot; stands for Voor Individuele Vrijheid en Arbeid in een Nieuwe Toekomst, (&quot;for individual freedom and labour in a new future&quot;) in Dutch.

==Elections==

Vivant first took part in the federal elections for the Belgian Senate and Chamber of Representatives in 1999, but obtained no seats. The 2003 elections were no different. In 2004 there were elections of the European Parliament and the Belgian regional parliaments, where Vivant took part in a list-cartel with the VLD, but none of Vivant&#x27;s candidates were elected. In 2006, Nele Lijnen became a co-opted member of the Senate.

<text>Tirschenreuth (Northern Bavarian: &quot;Landgreis Tirschenreith&quot;) is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the northeastern part of Bavaria, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the south, clockwise) Neustadt an der Waldnaab, Bayreuth and Wunsiedel. To the east are the Czech districts of Tachov (Plzeň) and Cheb (Karlovy Vary).

==Geography==
The district is located in the hills of the Fichtelgebirge. The main rivers in the district are the Waldnaab and the Fichtelnaab.

==History==
The district was formed in 1972 by merging the previous districts Tirschenreuth and Kemnath.

==Coat of arms==
The golden lion in the left of the coat of arms is the symbol of the Electorate of the Palatinate. The red dragon in the right is the symbol of the Waldsassen Abbey, and symbolizes the margravate of Diepolding. Only the upper part of the dragon is shown (while the monastery had the full dragon as their symbol), to symbolize that the status of the monastery was reduced in 1803 from an imperial monastery to a subordinate of the Palatinate. The blue bar in the bottom right is the symbol of the landgraves of Leuchtenberg, parts of the historically owned by them was included into the district in 1972.

<text>On 13 June 2004, regional elections were held in Belgium, to choose representatives in the regional councils of the Flemish Parliament, the Walloon Parliament, the Brussels Parliament and the German-speaking Community of Belgium. The elections were held on the same day as the European elections.

== Flemish Parliament ==

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

In the Flemish Parliament election, the liberal-socialist government was put to the test. The far right Vlaams Blok became the second largest party in Flanders just after the alliance of conservatives Christian Democratic and Flemish-New Flemish Alliance (CD&amp;V - N-VA). The green party Groen! managed to be elected and keeps half of their seats in the parliament. In contrast with the previous election, the People&#x27;s Union (VU-ID) has split and the new parties, N-VA and Spirit, allied with CD&amp;V and Different Socialist Party (SP.A) respectively.

Because of the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; of all the other parties against Vlaams Blok, a coalition of at least three parties needed to be formed in order to have a majority in the Flemish Parliament. Groen! confirmed that it did not want to take part in the new coalition, so the only coalition left was a conservative-socialist-liberal tripartite.

In the aftermath of the elections, Yves Leterme (CD&amp;V) was selected to form a Flemish regional government.

== Walloon Regional Parliament ==


In the aftermath of the elections, Elio Di Rupo (PS) was selected to form a Walloon regional government.

<doc id="521613" wikidata="Q565165" url="?curid=521613" title="Victorian architecture">
<text>Victorian architecture is a series of architectural revival styles in the mid-to-late 19th century. &quot;Victorian&quot; refers to the reign of Queen Victoria (1837–1901), called the Victorian era, during which period the styles known as Victorian were used in construction. However, many elements of what is typically termed &quot;Victorian&quot; architecture did not become popular until later in Victoria&#x27;s reign, roughly from 1850 and later. The styles often included interpretations and eclectic revivals of historic styles &quot;(see historicism)&quot;. The name represents the British and French custom of naming architectural styles for a reigning monarch. Within this naming and classification scheme, it followed Georgian architecture and later Regency architecture and was succeeded by Edwardian architecture.

Although Victoria did not reign over the United States, the term is often used for American styles and buildings from the same period, as well as those from the British Empire.

==Victorian architecture in the United Kingdom==

===Gothic Revival===

During the early 19th century, the romantic medieval Gothic Revival style was developed as a reaction to the symmetry of Palladianism, and such buildings as Fonthill Abbey were built.

By the middle of the 19th century, as a result of new technology, construction was able to incorporate metal materials as building components. Structures were erected with cast iron and wrought iron frames. However, due to being weak in tension, these materials were effectively phased out in place for more structurally sound steel. One of the greatest exponents of iron frame construction was Joseph Paxton, architect of the Crystal Palace. Paxton also continued to build such houses as Mentmore Towers, in the still popular English Renaissance styles. New methods of construction were developed in this era of prosperity, but ironically the architectural styles, as developed by such architects as Augustus Pugin, were typically retrospective.

In Scotland, the architect Alexander Thomson who practised in Glasgow was a pioneer of the use of cast iron and steel for commercial buildings, blending neo-classical conventionality with Egyptian and Oriental themes to produce many truly original structures. Other notable Scottish architects of this period are Archibald Simpson and Alexander Marshall Mackenzie, whose stylistically varied work can be seen in the architecture of Aberdeen.

While Scottish architects pioneered this style it soon spread right across the United Kingdom and remained popular for another forty years. Its architectural value in preserving and reinventing the past is significant. Its influences were diverse but the Scottish architects who practiced it were inspired by unique ways to blend architecture, purpose, and everyday life in a meaningful way.

===Other Revival styles===

* Jacobethan (1830–1870; the precursor to the British Queen Anne Revival style)
* Renaissance Revival (1840–1890)
* Neo-Grec (1845–1865)
* Romanesque Revival
* Second Empire (1855–1880; originated in France)
* British Queen Anne Revival (1870–1910)
* Scots Baronial (predominantly Scotland)
* British Arts and Crafts movement (1880–1910)

Some styles, while not uniquely Victorian, are strongly associated with the 19th century owing to the large number of examples that were erected during that period:
*Italianate
*Neoclassical

==International spread of Victorian styles==

During the 18th century, a few English architects emigrated to the colonies, but as the British Empire became firmly established during the 19th century, many architects emigrated at the start of their careers. Some chose the United States, and others went to Canada, Australia , New Zealand, and South Africa. Normally, they applied architectural styles that were fashionable when they left England. By the latter half of the century, however, improving transport and communications meant that even remote parts of the Empire had access to publications such as the magazine &quot;The Builder&quot;, which helped colonial architects keep informed about current fashion. Thus, the influence of English architecture spread across the world. Several prominent architects produced English-derived designs around the world, including William Butterfield (St Peter&#x27;s Cathedral, Adelaide) and Jacob Wrey Mould (Chief Architect of Public Works in New York City).

===Australia===
The Victorian period flourished in Australia and is generally recognised as being from 1840 to 1890, which saw a gold rush and population boom during the 1880s in the states of New South Wales and Victoria. There were fifteen styles that predominated:

The Arts and Crafts style and Queen Anne style are considered to be part of the Federation Period, from 1890 to 1915.

===Hong Kong===
Western influence in architecture was strong when Hong Kong was a British colony. Victorian architecture in Hong Kong:
===Ireland===

Georgian architecture is more prominent in Ireland than Victorian architecture. The cities of Dublin, Limerick, and Cork are famously dominated by Georgian squares and terraces. Though Victorian architecture flourished in certain quarters. Particularly around Dublin&#x27;s Wicklow Street and Upper Baggot Street and in the suburbs of Phibsboro, Glasnevin, Rathmines, Ranelagh, Rathgar, Rathfarnham, and Terenure. The colourful Italianate buildings of Cobh are excellent examples of the regional Victorian style in Ireland. Further examples of Victorian architecture in the country include Dublin&#x27;s George&#x27;s Street Arcade, the Royal City of Dublin Hospital on Baggot Street and the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital on Adelaide Road. 
===Sri Lanka===
During the British colonial period of British Ceylon:
Sri Lanka Law College,
Sri Lanka College of Technology,
Galle Face Hotel and the 
Royal College Main Building.

===North America===

In the United States, &#x27;Victorian&#x27; architecture generally describes styles that were most popular between 1860 and 1900. A list of these styles most commonly includes Second Empire (1855–85), Stick-Eastlake (1860–), Folk Victorian (1870–1910), Queen Anne (1880–1910), Richardsonian Romanesque (1880–1900), and Shingle (1880–1900). As in the United Kingdom, examples of Gothic Revival and Italianate continued to be constructed during this period and are therefore sometimes called Victorian. Some historians classify the later years of Gothic Revival as a distinctive Victorian style named High Victorian Gothic. Stick-Eastlake, a manner of geometric, machine-cut decorating derived from Stick and Queen Anne, is sometimes considered a distinct style. On the other hand, terms such as &quot;Painted Ladies&quot; or &quot;gingerbread&quot; may be used to describe certain Victorian buildings, but do not constitute a specific style. The names of architectural styles (as well as their adaptations) varied between countries. Many homes combined the elements of several different styles and are not easily distinguishable as one particular style or another.
Notable Victorian-inspired cities during this era include, Astoria in Oregon; Philadelphia and Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania; Washington, D.C.; Boston in Massachusetts; Alameda, Eureka, San Francisco, and Midtown Sacramento in California; The Brooklyn Heights and Victorian Flatbush sections of New York City, Garden City on Long Island, and Albany, Troy, Buffalo, and Rochester in Upstate New York; Asbury Park / Ocean Grove, Cape May, Deal, Flemington, Freehold, Hackettstown, Jersey City / Hoboken, Metuchen, Montclair, Ridgewood, Plainfield, Summit, and Westfield in New Jersey; Chicago, Galena, and Winnetka in Illinois; Detroit and Grand Rapids in Michigan; Cincinnati and Columbus in Ohio; Galveston in Texas; Baltimore in Maryland; Louisville in Kentucky; Atlanta in Georgia; Milwaukee in Wisconsin; New Orleans in Louisiana; Richmond in Virginia; St. Louis in Missouri; and Saint Paul in Minnesota. Los Angeles grew from a Pueblo (village) into a Victorian Downtown – now almost entirely demolished but with residential remnants in its Angelino Heights and Westlake neighborhoods. San Francisco is particularly well known for its extensive Victorian architecture, especially in the Haight-Ashbury, Lower Haight, Alamo Square, Western Addition, Mission, Duboce Triangle, Noe Valley, Castro, Nob Hill, and Pacific Heights neighborhoods.
The extent to which any one is the &quot;largest surviving example&quot; is debated, with numerous qualifications. The Distillery District in Toronto, Ontario contains the largest and best-preserved collection of Victorian-era industrial architecture in North America. Cabbagetown is the largest and most continuous Victorian residential area in North America. Other Toronto Victorian neighbourhoods include The Annex, Parkdale, and Rosedale. In the US, the South End of Boston is recognized by the National Register of Historic Places as the oldest and largest Victorian neighborhood in the country. Old Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky, also claims to be the nation&#x27;s largest Victorian neighborhood. Richmond, Virginia is home to several large Victorian neighborhoods, the most prominent being The Fan. The Fan district is best known locally as Richmond&#x27;s largest and most &#x27;European&#x27; of Richmond&#x27;s neighborhoods and nationally as the largest contiguous Victorian neighborhood in the United States. The Old West End neighborhood of Toledo, Ohio is recognized as the largest collection of late Victorian and Edwardian homes in the United States, east of the Mississippi. Summit Avenue in Saint Paul, Minnesota, has the longest line of Victorian homes in the country. Over-The-Rhine in Cincinnati, Ohio, has the largest collection of early Victorian Italianate architecture in the United States, and is an example of an intact 19th-century urban neighborhood. According to National Register of Historic Places, Cape May Historic District has one of the largest collections of late 19th century frame buildings left in the United States.

The photo album &quot;L&#x27;Architecture Americaine&quot; by Albert Levy published in 1886 is perhaps the first recognition in Europe of the new forces emerging in North American architecture.

===Canada===
Canada&#x27;s chief dominion architects designed numerous federal buildings over the course of the Victorian era. Thomas Fuller&#x27;s completion of the Canadian Parliament Buildings in 1866, in particular, established a High Victorian Gothic influence over Canadian architectural design for several consecutive decades, producing many public buildings, churches, residences, industrial buildings, and hotels.

=== India ===
Because India was a colony of Britain, Victorian Architecture is prevalent in India, especially in cities like Mumbai, Kolkata, Kerala and Chennai. In Mumbai (Formerly called Bombay) buildings like Municipal Corporation Building, Bombay University, Bombay High Court, Asiatic Society of Mumbai Building (Former Town Hall) and the David Sasoon Library are some examples of Victorian Architecture in Mumbai. In Kolkata (Formerly called Calcutta) buildings like the Victoria Memorial, Calcutta High Court, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, The Asiatic Society of Bengal are some examples of Victorian Architecture in Kolkata. In Chennai (Formerly called Madras) some examples include Madras High court, State Bank of Madras and St. Mary&#x27;s Church. Many churches and colleges such as Santa Cruz Cathedral Basilica Kochi, University College Trivandrum, Government College of Fine Arts Trivandrum, Napier Museum, State Central Library of Kerala, Government Victoria College Palakkad, CMS College Kottayam and SB College Changanasserry are some of finest examples of Victorian architecture in Kerala.

==Preservation==
Efforts to preserve landmarks of Victorian architecture are ongoing and are often led by the Victorian Society. A recent campaign the group has taken on is the preservation of Victorian gasometers after utility companies announced plans to demolish nearly 200 of the now-outdated structures.

<text>The Sydney Football Stadium, commercially known as Allianz Stadium and previously Aussie Stadium, was a football stadium in the Moore Park suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Built in 1988 next to the Sydney Cricket Ground, the stadium was Sydney&#x27;s premier rectangular field venue for rugby league, rugby union and football.

Australia&#x27;s national football teams, the Kangaroos, the Wallabies, and the Socceroos occasionally played at the stadium, while the Eastern Suburbs/Sydney City/Sydney Roosters, NSW Waratahs, and Sydney FC were the ground&#x27;s major tenants. The stadium usually held both National Rugby League semi finals and one preliminary final, and also held the annual pre-season Charity Shield football match between South Sydney and St George Illawarra for a number of years. It hosted all New South Wales Rugby League/Australian Rugby League rugby league grand finals, as well as the first grand final under the NRL banner, between 1988 and 1998.

The NSW Government announced plans in November 2017 for the stadium to be demolished and rebuilt. The stadium closed on 5 October 2018, with the last event being a Michael Bublé concert. Demolition began in early 2019, continuing after several legal challenges and becoming a major issue during the 2019 state election. It was ultimately replaced by the stadium of the same name opening on 28 August 2022.

==History==
===Background===

Prior to its construction, major events were usually held at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), as it was the largest stadium in Sydney. Although it was used many times for such events, the SCG&#x27;s oval shape meant it was not ideal for sports like soccer, rugby league and rugby union that require a rectangular field.

Sydney Football Stadium was built upon the former Sydney Sports Ground in Moore Park, and the former SCG No 2 adjacent to the existing SCG. Both were owned by the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust. It was built by Civil &amp; Civic and officially opened by Premier Barrie Unsworth on 24 January 1988. The first sporting event was a rugby league match between the Eastern Suburbs Roosters and St George Dragons on 4 March 1988.

Its seating capacity was 41,159, but after numerous expansions, finally stood at 45,500 , although the record attendance for a sporting event was 44,380 , set on 22 September 2018 for, ironically, the last sporting event it ever held: the 2018 NRL Finals Series match between the Sydney Roosters and South Sydney Rabbitohs.

===Use===

The Sydney Football Stadium was the Sydney Roosters&#x27; home ground from 1988. It was built on the site of the old Sydney Sports Ground which served as the Roosters home ground for decades, and the old SCG No 2 which served as a secondary ground for some state cricket matches, an additional training ground, and athletics. Both grounds were demolished in 1986 to make way for the SFS.

The first event held at the venue marked the beginning of the 1988 rugby league season, with a match between the then Eastern Suburbs Roosters and the St George Dragons on Friday 4 March 1988. St George won the game 24–14. The Roosters had to wait until Round 5 that season for their first win at the venue, defeating the Gold Coast Giants 28–10.

From 1988 to 1999 and from 2002 to 2005, it also served as the home ground for the South Sydney Rabbitohs. The Rabbitohs returned to the ground with a one-off game against the Broncos in Round 25 of the 2015 NRL season.

The SFS has hosted rugby league football test matches since its opening in 1988 starting with two matches in Australia&#x27;s 1988 Ashes series win against Great Britain. The first game of the series saw the Wally Lewis captained, Don Furner coached Australians christen their new Sydney home with a 17–6 win in front of 24,480 fans. That game was also the 100th test match between Australia and either Great Britain or England. The record international Rugby League crowd at the stadium was set for the first Ashes against Great Britain on their 1992 Australasian Tour when Australia won 22–6 in front of 40,141 in what was the first time a test in Sydney had attracted over 40,000 fans since 1974. The stadium has also hosted the Rugby League Tri-Nations, including the Final of the 2006 tournament in which Australia triumphed 16–12 over New Zealand in Golden point extra-time thanks to a try by captain Darren Lockyer.

Rugby league also had some memorable moments including: The first grand final in 1988 saw Canterbury-Bankstown defeat Balmain 24–12 in front of 40,000 fans to send former club captain Steve Mortimer into retirement with a premiership. The match had its controversial moment when Bulldogs Terry Lamb hit Tigers English import Ellery Hanley with a high tackle out of the game before the 30th minute: The 1989 NSWRL grand final which was won by the Canberra Raiders over the Balmain Tigers 19-14 thanks to a try by replacement forward Steve Jackson in extra-time for their first premiership: The 1991 NSWRL grand final won by the Penrith Panthers over Canberra 19–12 in which Penrith&#x27;s Royce Simmons scored 2 tries in his final match giving the Panthers their first title: Brisbane&#x27;s maiden premiership with a 28–8 win over St. George in 1992 NSWRL grand final, highlighted by a 95-metre try to Broncos Steve Renouf: and the 1997 ARL Grand Final between the Newcastle Knights and the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, with the Knights winning their first title with a 22–16 win following a try to Darren Albert in the dying seconds of the game after the Knights had trailed Manly since early in the game. Manly had won their previous 11 games against the Knights prior to that Grand Final.

The last grand final played at the SFS was the 1998 NRL Grand Final between Canterbury and Brisbane. In front of 40,857 fans, the Broncos ran out easy 38-12 winners to win their fourth premiership from four grand Final appearances.

Two standout State Of Origin matches in which Queensland triumphed over New South Wales with last-minute victories in 1994 and 1998, as well as Michael O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s sideline conversion in driving rain for a NSW win in Game 2 of the 1991 series. Also of note was Queensland&#x27;s backs to the wall win in Game 2 of the 1989. Despite losing Allan Langer to a broken leg, Mal Meninga with a fractured eye socket and Paul Vautin with an elbow injury in the first half, plus losing winger Michael Hancock to a shoulder injury in the second half, the Maroons triumphed 16–12 to wrap up the series. It was also found out after the game that Queensland&#x27;s lock forward Bob Lindner had played most of the second half with a fractured ankle.

The Sydney Football Stadium has been the venue of some of Australian sport&#x27;s greatest matches and moments. The final of the 1993 World Youth Cup between Brazil and Ghana was also held at the SFS, Brazil winning 2–1. The 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier between Australia and Argentina featuring Argentine association football legend Diego Maradona, finishing in a 1–1 draw with goals to Aurelio Vidmar for Australia and Abel Balbo for Argentina. Despite the grounds increase in capacity since 1993, this match retains the record sporting attendance at the SFS and many more were actually in attendance as the gates were thrown open close to kick-off as a safety measure.

It was used as the venue for the 2000 Summer Olympics Women&#x27;s association football gold medal match between Norway and the United States. Norway defeated the USA 3–2 in front of 22,848 fans.

In 2002, the naming rights were purchased by Aussie Home Loans in a 5-year + 5-year deal. Due to this, the stadium was renamed &quot;Aussie Stadium&quot;. On 7 July 2007 the stadium reverted to its original Sydney Football Stadium name after Aussie Home Loans and the SCG Trust mutually elected not to extend the naming rights deal.

In 2003, the SFS hosted several matches in the Rugby World Cup: (Ireland v Namibia), (Argentina v Romania), (Scotland v Fiji), (South Africa v Georgia), (Georgia v Uruguay; this match was notable for attracting a crowd of 28,576, despite the low profiles of both teams).

In 2007 the Sydney Roosters High Performance Centre and Administrative departments set up their headquarters at the Sydney Football Stadium.

The 2008 Rugby League World Cup&#x27;s opening ceremony and Group A match between Australia and New Zealand was played at the Stadium. The SFS also hosted one game from the knockout stage: the second semi-final between Australia and Fiji.

In 2012, Allianz Insurance secured the rights to the naming of the Sydney Football Stadium; the venue is now known as &quot;Allianz Stadium&quot;.

In 2018, Allianz Stadium hosted one of three AFL pre-season mini competitions called AFLX.

===Development===

In 2012 Sydney Cricket Ground Trust announced a master plan to redevelop Sydney Football Stadium, as well as Sydney Cricket Ground and the surrounding area, with a vision &quot;for the SCG and Allianz Stadium is to create an exciting new concept for Sydney’s central sporting precinct - a revitalised, world-class, sports and recreation facility for NSW and Australia&quot;. The development of Sydney Football Stadium would have included a new fully covered roof and a new LED facade mesh for the stadium which would allow the exterior to change colours to suit the home team, similar to Munich&#x27;s Allianz Arena. As well, development to the surrounding area would have included a new public plaza between the Sydney Cricket Ground and Sydney Football Stadium, new transport infrastructure, new underground car parks (4,100 cars) and development of the surrounding parkland. The scheduled start date for the project would have commenced after the completion of the Sydney Cricket Ground redevelopment, in January 2014. In early 2015, the video screens were replaced with large High Definition screens similar to the one at the Dally Messenger Stand at the SCG.

In September 2015, the New South Wales Government announced a proposal to replace the SFS with a new 50,000 to 55,000 seat venue. The proposed new stadium was cancelled in April 2016, with the SFS to be refurbished instead.

On 8 March 2019, the NSW government announced that the stadium would be demolished

===Rebuilding===

In 2017 the NSW Government announced that the Sydney Football Stadium along with Stadium Australia will be demolished and rebuilt at the cost of $2.3 billion. The final event at the stadium was a Michael Bublé concert on 5 October 2018. Demolition began in early 2019.
In December 2019, the NSW Government awarded the construction contract for the new Sydney Football Stadium to the John Holland Group, with a planned completion date in time for the September 2022 NRL Grand Final.

<text>£sd (occasionally written Lsd, spoken as &quot;pounds, shillings and pence&quot; or pronounced ), is the popular name for the pre-decimal currencies once common throughout Europe. The abbreviation originates from the Latin currency denominations , , and . In the United Kingdom, these were referred to as &quot;pounds&quot;, &quot;shillings&quot;, and &quot;pence&quot; (&quot;pence&quot; being the plural of &quot;penny&quot;).

Under this system, there were 12 pence in a shilling and 20 shillings, or 240 pence, in a pound. Although the standard ledger accounting system recorded only pounds, shillings and pence, actual minted coins could represent one, several or fractions of these units. The penny was subdivided into 4 farthings until 31 December 1960, when they ceased to be legal tender in the UK, and until 31 July 1969 there was also a halfpenny ( or , ) in circulation. 

The perceived advantage of such a system was its use in some aspects of mental arithmetic, as it afforded many factors and hence fractions of a pound such as tenths, eighths, sixths and even sevenths and ninths if the guinea (worth 21 shillings) was used. When dealing with items in dozens, multiplication and division are straightforward; for example, if a dozen eggs cost four shillings, then each egg was priced at fourpence. Basic addition, however, could be more difficult than using a decimal system.

Although the names originated from popular coins in the classical Roman Empire, their definitions and the ratios between them were introduced and imposed across Western Europe by the Emperor Charlemagne. King Offa of Mercia adopted the Frankish silver standard of , and into Britain in the late 8th century.

The £sd system was the standard across much of the European continent for over a thousand years, until the decimalisations of the 18th and 19th centuries. The United Kingdom remained one of the few countries retaining it into the 20th century, resulting in the system becoming particularly associated with Britain. For much of the 20th century, £sd remained the monetary system of most of the British Commonwealth, the major exceptions being Canada and India, until the 1960s and 1970s, with Nigeria being the last to abandon it in the form of the Nigerian pound on 1 January 1973.

Historically, similar systems based on Roman coinage were used elsewhere; e.g., the division of the in France and other pre-decimal currencies such as Spain, which had 20 to 1 and 20 to 1 or 5 .

== Origins ==
The classical Roman Empire originally used a decimal currency system based on the &quot;as&quot; whereby 1 &quot;denarius&quot; = 10 &quot;as&quot;. The silver denarius was the common circulation coin, but accounting was in sestercii. Later Roman Emperors undertook multiple coinage reforms, redefining weights and coins&#x27; relative values and introducing new coins and new accounting systems for them. Since most reforms were not even completed before the next one began, the late Roman Empire had a veritable mess of multiple overlapping systems of weights and currencies.
Around the 780s, the Frankish emperor Charlemagne cut through the mess by creating a new uniform system. He defined the &quot;libra&quot; as a new measure of weight equivalent to around 408 grams (substantially larger than the old Roman pound of 328.9g), and ordered 240 silver units known as &quot;denarii&quot; to be struck from the new Carolingian pound of pure silver, each &quot;denarius&quot; containing 22.5 grains of silver. To help accounting, Charlemagne also decreed that the pound was divisible into 20 &quot;solidi&quot; each of 12 &quot;denarii&quot;. Thus began the Carolingian monetary system (1&quot;l&quot;. = 20&quot;s&quot;. = 240&quot;d&quot;.).

The new coinage and accounting system was imposed uniformly across the vast Carolingian Empire and also infiltrated countries on its periphery. In the late 8th century, King Offa of Mercia imported the system into Britain to facilitate transactions (notably &quot;Peter&#x27;s pence&quot;) with the Roman Catholic Church (which used the Carolingian coinage system). But it was not the sole system in Britain – the £sd system would have to compete for a while with the Viking &quot;mark&quot; accounting system, introduced into Danelaw regions. Although £sd ultimately prevailed in Britain, the &quot;mark of account&quot; system lingered on in North Sea trade and areas of Hanseatic influence through much of the Middle Ages.

Charlemagne&#x27;s new monetary system prevailed across much of Western Europe including France (where the units were known as the &quot;livre&quot;, &quot;sous&quot; and &quot;denier&quot;), Italy (&quot;lira&quot;, &quot;soldo&quot; and &quot;denaro&quot;), the Holy Roman Empire (&quot;pfund&quot;, &quot;schilling&quot; and &quot;pfennig&quot;) and in England (&quot;pound&quot;, &quot;shilling&quot; and &quot;penny&quot;). The English name &quot;pound&quot; is a Germanic adaptation of the Latin phrase &#x27;a pound weight&#x27;. On the Iberian peninsula, the Kingdom of Aragon adopted the Carolingian monetary system (Catalan: &quot;lliura&quot;, &quot;sou&quot; and &quot;diners&quot;), but those of Portugal and Castile (and subsequently Spain) retained the currency system inherited from al-Andalus.

During the early Middle Ages, only the denarius was issued as an actual coin; the libra and solidus were merely units of account. But over time, the silver resources were gradually exhausted and the coins became repeatedly debased by mediaeval monarchs, prompting the minting of larger coins from the 13th century. It also led to specification of currencies by mint of origin in contracts and accounting (e.g. a &quot;denier parisis&quot;, of the Paris mint, contained more actual silver than the very debased &quot;denier tournois&quot; of the Tours mint).

To facilitate larger transactions, gold coins began to be minted in western Europe around the same time. The French &quot;franc&quot;, introduced in 1360, was the first coin anywhere to represent exactly £1 and the gold &quot;sovereign&quot;, first minted in 1489, was the first English £1 coin.

Although the £sd system remained intact in ledger accounting, the variety of new coins of various multiples and qualities led to common expression of quantities in terms of number of coins (guineas, crowns, farthings, etc.) But they would all have to be converted into formal £sd units in accounts.

== Decimalisation ==

The £sd system continued in much of Western Europe for nearly a thousand years, until the &quot;decimalisations&quot; of the 18th and 19th centuries. Britain considered following the continental example. A parliamentary select committee was set up in 1821 to inquire into decimalisation, but ended up recommending retaining the £sd system. However, pressure groups were formed inside Britain advocating the adoption of decimalisation of the currency, and Parliament returned to the matter in the 1850s. Various decimalisation schemes were considered – the Pound-and-Mil scheme, the Farthing scheme, the Half-penny scheme, the Alb scheme, etc. – but all were determined to have deficiencies, and transition would be too difficult and expensive. The £sd system was maintained in Britain until 1971.

As countries of the British Empire became independent, some abandoned the £sd system quickly, while others retained it almost as long as the UK itself. The United States of America was among the first to drop the £sd system and adopt a decimal currency in 1792, 10 years after independence from the British Empire, but retains many other aspects of the customary units for length and weight. Australia, on the other hand, only changed to using a decimal currency on 14 February 1966, 65 years after independence. New Zealand followed suit on 10 July 1967. Still others, notably Ireland, decimalised only when the UK did. The UK abandoned the old penny on Decimal Day, 15 February 1971, when one pound sterling became divided into 100 new pence. This was a change from the system used in the earlier wave of decimalisations in Australia, New Zealand, Rhodesia and South Africa, in which the pound was replaced with a new major currency called either the &quot;dollar&quot; or the &quot;rand&quot;. The British shilling was replaced by a 5 new pence coin worth one-twentieth of a pound. In Europe, decimalisation of currency (as well as other weights and measures) began in Revolutionary France with the law of 1795 (&quot;Loi du 18 germinal an III&quot;, 7 April 1795), replacing the £sd accounting system of the Ancien régime with a system of 1 franc = 10 decimes = 100 centimes. Decimalisation was carried by French armies to neighboring European countries during the Napoleonic wars. By the mid-19th century, most of continental Europe had decimalised, leaving the United Kingdom as the only major country to continue to maintain the £sd system.

All countries and territories that formerly used the £sd system have now decimalised their currency, with most decimalisations occurring after the Second World War. Malta decimalised its currency in 1972, while Nigeria decimalised in 1973. The British pound sterling and Irish pound were among the last to be decimalised, on 15 February 1971.

In places where £sd was used, there were several approaches to decimalisation:

* The pound remained the base unit (in Malta, using the Maltese name &quot;lira&quot;), but was subdivided into new fractional units of of a pound. The new fractional unit (called the &quot;new penny&quot; in the UK and Ireland and the &quot;cent&quot; in Malta) was worth 2.4 old pence. Malta also created a fractional unit worth of a pound, called the &quot;mil&quot;, worth slightly less than a farthing (0.24 old pence).
* A new base unit (often called the &quot;dollar&quot;) was created equal to ten shillings (half a pound), and subdivided into 100 fractional units, with one fractional unit (usually called the &quot;cent&quot;) equal to of a shilling or 1.2 old pence. This was the approach adopted in South Africa (as the Rand), Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, Fiji and many other countries.
* A new base unit called the &quot;dollar&quot; was created at parity with the United States dollar. This was done in Canada in 1858 and in many places in the West Indies in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In Bermuda in 1970, as the pound was fixed at US$2.40 i.e. US$1 = 100d., this made the new Bermudian dollar equal to exactly 100 old pence, with the new cent equal to one old penny.
* Some countries have adopted alternative approaches, such as Ghana, which created a new base unit equal to 100 old pence (not equal to the U.S. dollar), with a fractional unit equal to one old penny, Bahamas, which adopted a new base unit equal to seven shillings, with a fractional unit equal to 0.84 old pence, and The Gambia, which created a new base unit equal to four shillings, with a fractional unit equal to 0.48 old pence.

The following table shows the conversion of common denominations of coins of the £sd systems.

The following coins were not in common circulation in the UK at the time of decimalisation, though the ten shilling note and the pound note were.

The farthing, at penny, was never converted, as it ceased to be legal tender a decade prior to decimalisation. In 1971, a new penny would have been worth 9.6 farthings (making a farthing slightly more than 0.1 new pence). Similarly, the old halfpenny and the half-crown were not converted in the UK either, having been withdrawn in the run-up to decimalisation, although the half-crown was worth exactly 12 1/2 new pence.

== Pre-decimal coins and banknotes ==

In the UK, larger denomination notes (£5, £10, £20, £50, £100, £200, £500, and £1,000) printed from the 18th century to 1943 were called &quot;white notes&quot; because they were printed on lightweight white paper (on one side only) in black ink.

United Kingdom pre-decimal banknotes are no longer legal tender, but are exchangeable for their face value (regardless of the possible greater worth if sold or auctioned) if they are taken directly (or posted) to the Bank of England. The last £sd coins to cease being legal tender in the UK after Decimal Day were the sixpence (withdrawn 1980), the shilling (withdrawn 1991) and the florin (withdrawn 1993). Commemorative crowns minted post decimalisation (worth either 25p or £5) are still legal tender, but are rarely, if ever, spent.

The last £sd banknote to cease to be legal tender anywhere was the Isle of Man ten shilling note, which ceased to be legal tender there in 2013.

== Computing ==
Computers and calculators sold pre-decimalisation – mostly in the 1960s – occasionally came with special support for the £sd system in the form of a fixed-point currency datatype. The IBM 1401 is one such machine; on Sterling models with £sd support, it had a switch for selecting between IBM and BSI data layouts of £sd on its auxiliary console (see image). The ICT 1301 and the PL/I language also had £sd support.

== Writing conventions and pronunciations ==

There were several ways to represent amounts of money in writing and speech, with no formal convention; for example:

* 3 &quot;l.&quot; 17 &quot;s.&quot; 10 ½ &quot;d.&quot; (three pounds, seventeen shillings, and ten-and-a-half pence)
* £2/3/6 (two pounds, three shillings and sixpence), spoken, unless there was cause to be punctilious, &quot;two pound(s), three and six&quot;. Whether &quot;pound&quot; or &quot;pounds&quot; was used depended upon the speaker, varying with class, region and context.
* 1/– (one shilling), colloquially &quot;a bob&quot;; the slash sign derives from the older style of a long s for &quot;solidus&quot;, which is also one name for the sign itself; the &#x27;–&#x27; is used in place of &#x27;0&#x27;, meaning &quot;zero pence&quot;.
* 11d. (elevenpence)
* d (a penny halfpenny, three halfpence). As spoken, the &quot;lf&quot; in &quot;halfpenny&quot; and &quot;halfpence&quot; was always silent; they were pronounced &quot;hayp&#x27;ny&quot; and &quot;haypence&quot; – hence the occasional spellings &quot;ha&#x27;penny&quot; and &quot;ha&#x27;pence&quot;).
* 3d (three pence), with reference to the above, this became &quot;thruppence&quot;, commonly referred to as a &quot;threepenny bit&quot;.
* 6d (six pence) known as a &quot;tanner&quot; or half a shilling.
* 2/– (two shillings, or one florin, colloquially &quot;two-bob bit&quot; or just &quot;two bob&quot;)
* 2/6 (two shillings and six pence, usually said as &quot;two and six&quot; or &quot;a half-crown&quot;; the value could also be spoken as &quot;half a crown&quot;, but the coin was always a half-crown)
* 4/3 (&quot;four and threepence&quot;, the latter word pronounced &quot;thruppence&quot; , &quot;threppence&quot; , &quot;throopence&quot; with -oo- as in &quot;foot&quot; , or &quot;four-and-three&quot;)
* 5/– (five shillings, one crown, &quot;five bob&quot;, a dollar)
* £1/1/– one guinea - historically an amount paid for settlement of legal disputes, but currently still the wager on the winner of a horse race.
* £1/10/– (one pound, ten shillings; one pound ten, &quot;thirty bob&quot;)
* £1/19/ (one pound, nineteen shillings and elevenpence three farthings: a psychological price, one farthing under £2)
* £14/8/2 (fourteen pounds, eight shillings and twopence – pronounced &quot;tuppence&quot; – in columns of figures. Commonly read &quot;fourteen pound(s) eight and two&quot;)

Halfpennies and farthings (quarter of a penny) were represented by the appropriate symbol ( for farthing, for halfpenny, or for three farthings) after the whole pence.

A convention frequently used in retail pricing was to list prices over one pound all in shillings, rather than in pounds and shillings; for example, £4-18-0 would be written as 98/– (£4.90 in decimal currency). This is still seen in shilling categories of Scottish beer, such as 90/– beer.

Sometimes, prices of luxury goods and furniture were expressed by merchants in guineas, although the guinea coin had not been struck since 1799. A guinea was 21 shillings (£1.05 in decimal currency). Professionals such as lawyers and physicians, art dealers, and some others stated their fees in guineas rather than pounds, while, for example, salaries were stated in pounds per annum. Historically, at some auctions, the purchaser would bid and pay in guineas but the seller would receive the same number of pounds; the commission was the same number of shillings. Tattersalls, the main auctioneer of racehorses in the United Kingdom and Ireland, continues this tradition of conducting auctions in guineas at its UK sales (in Ireland, auctions are conducted in euros). The vendor&#x27;s commission is 5%. The word &quot;guineas&quot; is still found in the names of some British horse races, even though their prize funds are now fixed in pounds – such as the 1,000 Guineas and 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse.

== Colloquial terms ==


== In popular culture ==
The currency of knuts, sickles and galleons in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books is a parody of the £sd system, with 29 knuts to a sickle and 17 sickles to a galleon. It serves as the currency of the Wizarding World, while pounds are still used by Muggles, the non-magical people.

Lysergic acid diethylamide was sometimes called &quot;pounds, shillings and pence&quot; during the 1960s, because of the abbreviation LSD. The English rock group the Pretty Things released a 1966 single titled &quot;£.s.d.&quot; that highlighted the double entendre. The Chemical Defence Experimental Establishment called the first field trial with LSD as a chemical weapon &quot;Moneybags&quot; as a pun.

The score of 26 at darts (one dart in each of the top three spaces) was sometimes called &quot;half-a-crown&quot; as late as the 1990s, though this did start to confuse the younger players. 26 is also referred to as &quot;Breakfast&quot;, since 2/6, or half a crown, was the standard cost for breakfast pre-decimalisation.

<doc id="521624" wikidata="Q7055162" url="?curid=521624" title="North Dumpling Island">
<text>North Dumpling Island is a island in Fishers Island Sound of Long Island Sound, off the coast of Connecticut, south of Groton, within the territory of the town of Southold on Long Island in New York State. The island is about north of South Dumpling Island, and is home to the North Dumpling Light, which dates from 1859. The island is privately owned by Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway.

==History==
In 1639, John Winthrop, son of the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, bought Fishers Island and the small islets around it, including those called &quot;The Dumplings&quot;. Ownership of the islands, including North Dumpling, remained with the Winthrop family until 1847, when it was sold to the federal government for $600 to be the site of a lighthouse. The lighthouse and the keeper&#x27;s dwelling were built and the light illuminated in 1859, and then rebuilt in 1871 with a taller tower. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1959, being replaced by an automated light on a skeleton tower, and the grounds and lighthouse were sold to a private party, George Washburn. The island was purchased in 1977 by David Levitt, president of the Doughnut Corporation of America, who remodeled and expanded the house. Levitt convinced the Coast Guard to move the light back to the stone tower and to remove the skeleton tower. Levitt added sculptures to the island, including Temple of the Four Winds, the Moon Rock, and Meditation Rock. In 1986, Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway and founder of FIRST, purchased the island for .

After a denial from local officials to build his own wind turbine on the island, Kamen &quot;seceded&quot; from the United States. Although Kamen&#x27;s secession is not legally recognized, he still refers to the island as the &quot;Kingdom of North Dumpling&quot; and has established a constitution, a flag, a currency (the dumpling), a national anthem, which is a parody of the song &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; written by Paul Lazarus, and a navy consisting of a single amphibious vehicle. The people of North Dumpling are called &quot;Dumplonians&quot;, and Kamen is said to refer to himself as &quot;Lord Dumpling&quot; or &quot;Lord Dumpling II&quot;.

Despite still being a part of the United States, Kamen claimed he was able to leverage his personal relationship with then-president George H. W. Bush to sign an unofficial non-aggression pact.

Kamen was eventually able to build his turbine, and the island&#x27;s electrical system was later converted to a combination of wind and solar power with the help of Fritz Morgan, Chief Technology Officer of Philips Color Kinetics, operating independently of the regional electrical grid. This was accomplished by replacing all lighting on the island with LEDs, which resulted in a 70% reduction of in-house energy consumption. Kamen says that the island is carbon neutral due to solar panels on every building, a 10 kW wind turbine, and a &quot;little&quot; Stirling engine for backup power.

In addition to North Dumpling Lighthouse, the island features a replica of Stonehenge.

<text>The Texas House of Representatives is the lower house of the bicameral Texas Legislature. It consists of 150 members who are elected from single-member districts for two-year terms. There are no term limits. The House meets at the State Capitol in Austin.

==Leadership==
The leadership for the 89th Legislature is as follows:

The Speaker of the House is the presiding officer and highest-ranking member of the House. The Speaker&#x27;s duties include maintaining order within the House, recognizing members during debate, ruling on procedural matters, appointing members to the various committees and sending bills for committee review.

The Speaker pro tempore is primarily a ceremonial position, but does, by long-standing tradition, preside over the House during its consideration of local and consent bills.

Unlike other state legislatures, the House rules do not formally recognize majority or minority leaders. The unofficial leaders are the Republican Caucus Chairman and the Democratic House Leader, both of whom are elected by their respective caucuses.

==Composition==

Republicans currently hold a majority of seats in the House.

Texas&#x27; legislative districts are an example of gerrymandering; however, requirements in the Texas Constitution are more strict than other states.

<text>Prograph is a visual, object-oriented, dataflow, multiparadigm programming language that uses iconic symbols to represent actions to be taken on data. Commercial Prograph software development environments such as Prograph Classic and Prograph CPX were available for the Apple Macintosh and Windows platforms for many years but were eventually withdrawn from the market in the late 1990s. Support for the Prograph language on macOS has recently reappeared with the release of the Marten software development environment.

==History==

Research on Prograph started at Acadia University in 1982 as a general investigation into dataflow languages, stimulated by a seminar on functional languages conducted by Michael Levin. Diagrams were used to clarify the discussion, leading to the insight: &quot;since the diagrams are clearer than the code, why not make the diagrams themselves executable!&quot; Thus Prograph - Programming in Graphics - was born as a visual dataflow language. This work was led by Dr. Tomasz Pietrzykowski, with Stan Matwin and Thomas Muldner co-authoring early papers. From 1983 to 1985, research prototypes were built on a Three Rivers PERQ graphics workstation (in Pascal, with the data visualized as fireballs moving down datalinks), and a VAX with a Tektronix terminal, and an experimental compiler was programmed in an IBM PC. This work was continued at Technical University of Nova Scotia by Pietrzykowski and Dr. Philip Cox, including a version done in Prolog.

In 1985, work began on a commercialisable prototype on the Macintosh, the only widely available, low-priced computer with high-level graphics support available at the time. In early 1986, this prototype was taken over by &quot;The Gunakara Sun Systems&quot; (later renamed to &quot;TGS Systems&quot;) for commercialisation, TGS formerly being a consulting firm formed by Pietrzykowski at Acadia University. Working with Pietrzykowski and Cox, Terry Kilshaw hired and managed the original development team, with Jim Laskey as the lead developer. In 1987 Mark Szpakowski suggested the merger of object-orientation with visual dataflow, creating an &quot;objectflow&quot; system. After almost four years of development, the first commercial release, v1.2, was introduced at the OOPSLA conference in New Orleans in October 1989. This product won the 1989 MacUser Editor&#x27;s Choice Award for Best Development Tool. Version 2.0, released in July 1990, added a compiler to the system.

TGS changed its name to &quot;Prograph International&quot; (PI) in 1990. Although sales were slow, development of a new version, &quot;Prograph CPX&quot; (&quot;Cross-Platform eXtensions&quot;) was undertaken in 1992, that was intended to build fully cross-platform applications. This version was released in 1993, and was immediately followed by development of a client-server application framework. Despite increasing sales, the company was unable to sustain operating costs, and following a failed financing attempt in late 1994, went into receivership in early 1995.

As the receivership proceeded, the management and employees of PI formed a new company, &quot;Pictorius&quot;, which acquired the assets of PI. Shortly afterwards, development of a Windows version of Prograph CPX was begun. Although it was never formally released, versions of Windows Prograph were regularly made available to Prograph CPX customers, some of whom ported existing applications written in Macintosh Prograph, with varying degrees of success.

After management changes at the new company, emphasis shifted from tools development to custom programming and web application development. In April 2002 the web development part of the company was acquired by the Paragon Technology Group of Bermuda and renamed Paragon Canada. The Pictorius name and rights to the Prograph source code were retained by McLean Watson Capital, a Toronto-based investments firm which had heavily funded Pictorius. A reference to Pictorius appeared for a time on the former&#x27;s Portfolio page, but has since disappeared. The Windows version of CPX was later released for free use, and was available for some time for download from the remnants of the Pictorius website (link below).

A group of Prograph users (&quot;Prographers&quot;) calling themselves &quot;The Open Prograph Initiative&quot; (OPI) formed in the late 1990s with the goal of keeping Prograph viable in the face of OS advances by Apple and Microsoft. For a time, the group also sought to create a new open-source visual programming language to serve as Prograph&#x27;s successor, but with the advent of Andescotia&#x27;s Marten visual programming environment, participation in the group essentially ceased.

The Prograph language is supported by the Marten IDE from Andescotia Software.

==Description==

During the 1970s program complexity was growing considerably, but the tools used to write programs were generally similar to those used in the 1960s. This led to problems when working on larger projects, which would become so complex that even simple changes could have side effects that are difficult to fully understand. Considerable research into the problem led many to feel that the problem was that existing programming systems focused on the logic of the program, while in reality the purpose of a program was to manipulate data. If the data being manipulated is the important aspect of the program, why isn&#x27;t the data the &quot;first class citizen&quot; of the programming language? Working on that basis, a number of new programming systems evolved, including object-oriented programming and dataflow programming.

Prograph took these concept further, introducing a combination of object-oriented methodologies and a completely visual environment for programming. Objects are represented by hexagons with two sides, one containing the data fields, the other the methods that operate on them. Double-clicking on either side would open a window showing the details for that object; for instance, opening the variables side would show class variables at the top and instance variables below. Double-clicking the method side shows the methods implemented in this class, as well as those inherited from the superclass. When a method itself is double-clicked, it opens into another window displaying the logic.
In Prograph a method is represented by a series of icons, each icon containing an instructions (or group of them). Within each method the flow of data is represented by lines in a directed graph. Data flows in the top of the diagram, passes through various instructions, and eventually flows back out the bottom (if there is any output).

Several features of the Prograph system are evident in this picture of a database sorting operation. The upper bar shows that this method, codice_1, is being passed in a single parameter, codice_2. This object is then fed, via the lines, into several operations. Three of these extract a named index (codice_3 etc.) from the object using the codice_4 operation (the unconnected getter output passes on the &quot;whole&quot; object), and then passes the extracted index to a sort operation. The output of these sort operations are then passed, along with a reference to the original database, to the final operation, codice_5. The bar at the bottom of the picture represents the outputs of this method, and in this case there are no connections to it and so this method does not return a value. Also note that although this is a method of some class, there is no codice_6; if self is needed, it can be provided as an input or looked up.

In a dataflow language the operations can take place as soon as they have valid inputs for all of their connections. That means, in traditional terms, that each operation in this method could be carried out at the same time. In the database example, all of the sorts could take place at the same time if the computer were capable of supplying the data. Dataflow languages tend to be inherently concurrent, meaning they are capable of running on multiprocessor systems &quot;naturally&quot;, one of the reasons that it garnered so much interest in the 1980s.

Loops and branches are constructed by modifying operations with annotations. For instance, a loop that calls the codice_7 method on a list of input data is constructed by first dragging in the doit operator, then attaching the loop modifier and providing the list as the input to the loop. Another annotation, &quot;injection&quot;, allows the method itself to be provided as an input, making Prograph a dynamic language to some degree.
==Execution==

The integrated Prograph development and execution environment also allowed for visual debugging. The usual breakpoint and single-step mechanisms were supported. Each operation in a data flow diagram was visually highlighted as it executed. A tooltip-like mechanism displayed data values when the mouse was held over a data-link when stopped in debug mode. Visual display of the execution stack allowed for both roll-back and roll-forward execution. For many users the visual execution aspects of the language were as important as its edit-time graphical facilities.

The most important run-time debugging feature was the ability to change the code on the fly while debugging. This allowed for bugs to be fixed while debugging without the need to recompile.

<text>The South Australian gulf drainage division is the area surrounding the Gulf St Vincent and Spencer Gulf and a sliver of country to the immediate north. It includes 75,000 square kilometres of mostly moderately flat territory, broken only by the Mount Lofty Ranges which reach 932 metres at their highest point. It is bounded by the Murray-Darling Basin to the east, the Lake Eyre Basin to the north, and the Western Plateau to the west.

While waters falling to the north and west flow inland and dissipate into the sands and ephemeral salt lakes of the central Australian deserts, waters falling on the South Australian gulf drainage division flow south to the sea. Rainfall over the area varies between 200 and 750 mm (8 to 30 inches) per year, tends to be concentrated on the highest and most southerly districts, and primarily occurs in winter.

There are no permanent fresh water lakes in the region and the rivers are short. The best-known of them is the River Torrens, which flows through the capital of South Australia, Adelaide.

<doc id="521645" wikidata="Q2065695" url="?curid=521645" title="Southampton Solent University">
<text>Southampton Solent University (formerly and commonly known as Solent University) is a public university based in Southampton, United Kingdom. It has approximately 10,500 students (2019/20). Its main campus is located on East Park Terrace near the city centre and the maritime hub of Southampton.

Solent University students are represented by Solent Students&#x27; Union, which is based on the East Park Terrace campus.

==History==
The university&#x27;s origins can be traced back to a private School of Art founded in 1856, which eventually became the Southampton College of Art. Mergers with the Southampton College of Technology, and later the College of Nautical Studies at Warsash, led to the establishment of the Southampton Institute of Higher Education in 1984.

Southampton Institute became a university on 12 July 2005, adopting the name Southampton Solent University on 15 August that year. Prior to this, Southampton Institute provided assistance to Nottingham Trent University in its provision of business-focused degrees, relating to accountancy, finance and professional ACCA qualifications; some Nottingham Trent University certificates included Southampton Institute/Solent University stamps to indicate this agreement.

In 2015, Solent University came to an agreement with New College of the Humanities, London, whereby it would validate some of their degrees. In November 2017, the Privy Council approved the change of name of Southampton Solent University to Solent University, with effect from 2018. In 2024, the university proposed a return to their previous name, citing &#x27;research that suggests reinstating the location of the university into the name is an important factor in both its collaboration with local and national stakeholders and likely success in future recruitment&#x27;. On 24 September 2024, the university officially reverted to its former name, Southampton Solent University. 

Since April 2023, the current Vice Chancellor is Professor James Knowles.

==Campus==
The university has three primary locations: 

* East Park Terrace is the primary campus of the university and was established in the 1960s. It is on the east side of East Park, in central Southampton.
* The Warsash School of Maritime Science and Engineering is on the eastern bank of the Hamble River overlooking Southampton Water.
* Timsbury Lake hosts the Manned Model Training Centre for Warsash. It opened in 2011.

Outside of the above, the university also has facilities at external locations:

* Test Park Sports Ground, an outdoor sports facility situated in Millbrook, in the north west of the city. It opened in 2011.
* Re:So is a student-run shop based in the Marlands shopping centre in central Southampton. It sells items created by alumni as well as current students of creative courses. It is also used for some work-based learning projects.

The university has five major student Halls complexes:
* Chantry
* Deanery
* Hamwic
* Kimber (incorporating the David Moxon Annexe)

All the halls are located away from the main teaching buildings. They are all located south east of the city centre, between the St Mary&#x27;s and Ocean Village areas of Southampton.

===Former locations===
* The Lucia Foster Welch residence was under lease from 1995 to 2020; the lease was not renewed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
* The Sir James Matthews building on Guildhall Square had been in use since 1993, but was left empty in 2019 after the law and digital courses were relocated. It was sold to Southampton University in July 2021 for £5.5m; Solent retained use of some specialist performance spaces for three years after the sale.
* The Below Bar campus, formerly known as Southampton School of Art, was operational from 2011 to 2023, and was a centre for the art &amp; design courses. It was based in a renovated property under lease.
* The Austen building was leased from 2017 to 2024 for the use of Warsash. This was situated in the St. Mary&#x27;s campus of Southampton College.

Solent University is a comprehensive university offering programmes across five academic faculties, including the Faculty of Business, Law and Digital Technologies (which incorporates the Solent Business School and the Solent Law School), the Faculty of Creative Industries, Architecture and Engineering, the Faculty of Sport, Health and Social Science, and Warsash Maritime School.

The university also has links with local and regional businesses, professional bodies and industry groups, all with a focus on providing the best routes into the workforce (for example the British Computer Society, Creative Skillset and the PTC).

The student yachting team have often consisted of Olympians and are previous world champions.

==Research==
The university also has a Research, Innovation and Enterprise Office, providing a researcher development programme and the Research, Innovation and Knowledge Exchange Awards.

===Creative and digital industries===

===Business and society===
Working with private, public and third sector industries, Solent focuses on research areas such as marketing, the &#x27;visitor economy&#x27;, SME partnerships, international economic development, entrepreneurship and innovation, and cyber-crime. A particular focus is social policy in relation to employment, gender, and diversity in areas ranging from maritime and seafarers, to music and culture.

===Sport, health and wellbeing===
Solent University has emerged as a provider of academic programmes relating to the study of sport, health and wellbeing. These programmes are informed by research in areas such as sports science, sports development, the sociology of sport, psychology, health and wellbeing, and social care.

A focus of current research is how sport can be used as a vehicle for social change. Research in sports science focuses on strength and conditioning, the physiological basis of human performance in a range of sub-elite and elite sporting environments, and the psychology of the coaching process. The university is also recognised as one of the leading centres for football-based research.

===Maritime, technology and environment===
Historically, one of the research strengths of Solent has been the maritime sector. Having run courses in yacht design and boat yard management since the 1970s and then by adding Warsash Maritime Academy with its long history and association with shipping, ports and seafarer training in the late 1990s this is now fully integrated as the Warsash School of Maritime Science and Engineering.

The focus is on applied research and innovation that affect industry, including a focus on maritime education and training (including the use of technology), employment, health and safety, gender, and welfare. They also have a developing area of research relating to sustainability and resilience, including environmental accounting, life-cycle assessment; environmental impacts, and modelling. Other areas of research include materials science and additive manufacturing; acoustics; computer networks, immersive technologies, multimedia communication, and software engineering; as well as sustainable design and the built environment. It also hosts the China Centre (Maritime).

=== Media Technology ===
The Media Technology courses (such as the Broadcast Engineering, Live Sound and Acoustics courses) have now been merged into one &#x27;Live Event Technology&#x27; course which covers all of these bases.

This course works with Sonar Events to provide technical skills for their productions. They also work at festivals in the UK, such as Glastonbury and Boardmasters.

==Student life==

===Student Media===
The TV and Live Events Societies at Solent University are covered by the umbrella brand of &#x27;Sonar Events&#x27;. These outlets are run entirely by students.

====TV station====
The student-run television station operated under the name SonarTV; it was founded in 2009 as part of the student media rebrand within the Students&#x27; Union. in 2022, SonarTV rebranded to join the Live Events Society to form SonarEvents; the new and current name for the societies.

SonarEvents are the only outlet within the university that can affiliate with NaSTA (The National Student Television Association), and in 2012 was selected to be the joint host for the first-ever NaSTAvision broadcast with Staffs TV of Staffordshire University.

====Radio station====
The student-run Radio Station is called Radio Sonar. It was founded in 1999 and was originally known as Sin FM. The name came from the first 28-day FM radio licence held by the station. After applying for a Low Powered AM (LPAM) licence, the station changed its name to Sin Radio and at the same time became an online radio station; the name was changed to Radio Sonar in 2009. (The rename was in conjunction with all Student Union media, part of the Sonar Media rebrand.) Radio Sonar won the award for &#x27;Outstanding Contribution to Student Radio&#x27; at the National Student Radio Conference in 2010 and again in 2011; in 2012, Mel Lewis won Best Female Presenter. Radio Sonar was nominated in the 2014 SRA awards for &#x27;Best Chart Show&#x27; and achieved third place.

<text>KMSP-TV (channel 9) is a television station licensed to Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, serving the Twin Cities area. It is owned and operated by the Fox network through its Fox Television Stations division alongside WFTC (channel 9.2), which broadcasts MyNetworkTV. The two stations share studios on Viking Drive in Eden Prairie; KMSP-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located in Shoreview, Minnesota.

KMSP-TV also serves the Mankato market (via K35KI-D in nearby St. James through the local municipal-operated Cooperative TV (CTV) network of translators), even though that area already has a Fox affiliate of its own. KMSP is also carried on the main channel of KFTC (channel 26), a satellite station of WFTC licensed to Bemidji which serves the northernmost reaches of the Minneapolis–St. Paul television market.

KMSP-TV is also carried in Canada on the Rogers Cable system in Thunder Bay, Ontario, on Tbaytel, and on Bell MTS Fibe TV in the province of Manitoba. Since October 2022, the station is also carried on Westman Communications, replacing Rochester, New York&#x27;s WUHF.

==History==
The Family Broadcasting Corporation in Minneapolis, owner of radio station KEYD (1440 AM, now KYCR), filed an application with the FCC for a construction permit for a new commercial television station to be operated on Channel 9 on November 24, 1953. WLOL and WDGY (now KTLK) also expressed interest, but withdrew their applications in 1954, effectively handing the permit to Family Broadcasting. KEYD-TV began broadcasting on January 9, 1955, and was affiliated with the DuMont Television Network. During this time, Harry Reasoner, a graduate of Minneapolis West High School and the University of Minnesota, was hired as the station&#x27;s first news anchor and news director. However, DuMont shut down in August 1956, leaving the station as an independent outlet; on June 3, 1956, the KEYD stations were sold to United Television, whose principals at the time included several stockholders of Pittsburgh station WENS, for $1.5 million. The new owners immediately sold off KEYD radio, refocused KEYD-TV&#x27;s programming on films and sports, and shut down the news department; Reasoner was hired by CBS News a few months later. Reasoner became a host for CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; when it launched in 1968.

Channel 9 changed its call letters to KMGM-TV on May 23, 1956. At the time, the station was in negotiations with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to acquire the Twin Cities television rights to the company&#x27;s films, along with selling a 25 percent stake in KMGM-TV to the studio. Negotiations broke down later that month over the cost of the films; additionally, Loew&#x27;s, MGM&#x27;s parent company at the time, filed a petition with the FCC against the call sign change, claiming that the use of KMGM was unauthorized and a violation of MGM&#x27;s trademark. The FCC ruled against Loew&#x27;s that October, saying that its call sign assignment policies were limited to preventing confusion between stations in a given area. The agreements to lease MGM&#x27;s pre-1949 films and sell 25 percent of the station to Loew&#x27;s were both completed that November; KMGM was the third station, after future sister station KTTV in Los Angeles and KTVR in Denver, to enter into such an arrangement.

National Telefilm Associates, which later purchased WNTA-TV in the New York City area, purchased the 75 percent of United Television not owned by MGM for $650,000 in November 1957, joining it to the NTA Film Network until it ended in 1961. After taking control, NTA expanded KMGM-TV&#x27;s hours of operation as part of an overhaul of channel 9&#x27;s schedule that also included the addition of newscasts. A few months later, on February 10, 1958, NTA bought MGM&#x27;s stake for $130,000 and announced that it would change channel 9&#x27;s calls to KMSP-TV; the call sign change took effect that March over the objections of KSTP-TV (channel 5). National Theatres, a theater chain whose broadcast holdings already included WDAF AM-TV in Kansas City, began the process of acquiring NTA in November 1958; in April 1959, it purchased 88 percent of the company. 20th Century-Fox, the former parent company of National Theatres, bought KMSP-TV for $4.1 million on November 9, 1959, retaining the United Television corporate name. The KMSP call letters were featured on prop television cameras in the May 29, 1963, episode of the CBS sitcom &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, produced by 20th Century Fox Television; the show was loosely set in the Twin Cities area. The episode was titled &quot;The Call of the, Like, Wild&quot;.

During its early years until 1972, the station&#x27;s studios and offices were located in a lower level of the Foshay Tower in downtown Minneapolis; the transmitter was located on top of the building, the tallest structure in the area until 1971, along with WCCO-TV (channel 4) and WTCN-TV (channel 11, now KARE).

===As an ABC affiliate===
KMSP-TV took over the ABC affiliation from WTCN-TV on April 16, 1961. Throughout its years with ABC, KMSP was perennially the lowest-rated network affiliate in the Twin Cities, with only one-third of the viewing audience of each of their two competitors, CBS affiliate WCCO-TV and NBC affiliate KSTP-TV. It was also notorious for having a sub-standard news department with large staff turnover. In 1971, KMSP built a new tower in Shoreview, while the studios and offices relocated in 1972 to Edina on York Avenue South, across from Southdale Shopping Center.

In the late 1970s, ABC steadily rose to first place in the network ratings. Accordingly, the network sought to upgrade its slate of affiliates, which were made up of some stations that either had poor signals or poorly performing local programming. In December 1977, ABC warned United that it would yank its affiliation from channel 9 unless improvements were made and fast. In early 1978, to cash in on ABC&#x27;s improved ratings, KMSP re-branded itself &quot;ABC9&quot; (approximately 20 years before the use of a network&#x27;s name in a station&#x27;s on-air branding became commonplace among U.S. affiliates), and retooled its newscast. Despite the changes, KMSP&#x27;s news department remained in the ratings cellar.

===Becoming an independent once again===

On August 29, 1978, ABC announced that KSTP-TV would become the network&#x27;s new Twin Cities affiliate the following spring. The signing of channel 5 made nationwide news, as it had been an NBC affiliate for three decades. KSTP-TV looked forward to affiliating with the top network, as third-place NBC had been in a long ratings slump. In retaliation for losing ABC, KMSP-TV immediately removed all ABC branding and regularly preempted network programming. Channel 9 then attempted to affiliate with NBC, thinking &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; would be a good lead-out from their 10 p.m. newscast, despite low prime time ratings. However, NBC, miffed at losing one of its strongest affiliates, and not wanting to pick up ABC&#x27;s rejects, turned down KMSP&#x27;s offer almost immediately and signed an affiliation agreement with independent station WTCN-TV. As a result of being rejected by both ABC and NBC, KMSP-TV prepared to become an independent station. Although it now faced a lack of weekend and weekday national sports coverage and having to buy seven to eight additional hours of programming per day, it also would not have to invest nearly as much into its news department and could invest its affiliate dues into syndicated film rights and local sports instead. Most of the on-air and off-air staffers resigned, not wanting to work for a down-scaled independent operation.

The affiliation switch occurred on March 5, 1979, and KMSP debuted its new independent schedule featuring cartoons, syndicated shows and even the locally based American Wrestling Association, with much of the station&#x27;s programming having been acquired from WTCN-TV. To emphasize that the station&#x27;s programming decisions would be influenced by viewers instead of a network, KMSP rebranded itself as &quot;Receptive Channel 9&quot;, and an antenna was shown atop the station&#x27;s logo in station identifications. The station became quite aggressive in acquiring programming, obtaining broadcast rights to several state high school sports championships from the MSHSL, the NHL&#x27;s Minnesota North Stars and the Minnesota Twins baseball team.

As it turned out, KMSP&#x27;s transition into an independent station turned out to be a blessing in disguise. It was far more successful than the station ever had been as an ABC affiliate. It became a regional superstation, available on nearly every cable system in Minnesota as well as large portions of North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Wisconsin. Over time, it became one of the most successful and profitable independent stations in the country.

KMSP went through another ownership change on June 9, 1981, when 20th Century-Fox spun off United Television as an independent company owned by Fox shareholders; the transaction was approved alongside the $700 million sale of 20th Century-Fox to Marvin Davis. Chris-Craft Industries, which in 1977 had acquired an interest in 20th Century-Fox that by 1981 comprised 22 percent of Fox&#x27;s stock, received a 19 percent stake in United Television; later in June, it filed with the FCC for control of United, as it now owned 32 percent of its stock. Two years later, Chris-Craft, though its BHC subsidiary, increased its stake in United Television to 50.1 percent and gained majority control of the company.

===First Fox affiliation, then back to independent===
KMSP-TV remained an independent station through 1986 when it became one of the original charter affiliates of the newly launched Fox network on October 9. This suited channel 9, as it wanted the prestige of being a network affiliate without being tied to a network-dominated schedule. At the time, Fox only programmed a nightly talk show and, starting in 1987, two nights of prime time programming; the network would start its full-week programming schedule in 1993. Thus, like most early Fox affiliates, KMSP was still essentially an independent. For its first few years with Fox, the station served as the &quot;de facto&quot; Fox affiliate for nearly all of Minnesota and South Dakota.

However, the station did not remain a Fox affiliate for long. By 1988, KMSP was one of several Fox affiliates nationwide that were disappointed with the network&#x27;s weak programming offerings, particularly on Saturday nights, which were bogging down KMSP&#x27;s otherwise successful independent lineup. That January, channel 9 dropped Fox&#x27;s Saturday night lineup; the move did not sit well with Fox, and in July 1988 the network announced that it would not renew its affiliations with KMSP and Chris-Craft sister station KPTV in Portland, Oregon. Fox then signed an agreement with KITN (channel 29, now WFTC) to become its new Twin Cities affiliate, and KMSP reverted to being an independent station full-time. In 1992, the station relocated to its current studio facilities on Viking Drive in Eden Prairie. Along with the other United Television stations, KMSP carried programming from the Prime Time Entertainment Network from 1993 to 1995.

===As a UPN affiliate===
By the early 1990s, Fox had exploded in popularity; it had begun carrying strong shows that were starting to rival the program offerings of the &quot;Big Three&quot; networks and had just picked up the broadcast rights to the NFL&#x27;s National Football Conference. In response to this, in October 1993, Chris-Craft/United Television partnered with Paramount Pictures (which was acquired by Viacom in 1994) to form the United Paramount Network (UPN) and both companies made independent stations that both companies respectively owned in several large and mid-sized U.S. cities charter stations of the new network.

UPN launched on January 16, 1995, (with the two-hour premiere of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;), with channel 9 becoming a UPN owned-and-operated station due to Chris-Craft/United&#x27;s ownership stake in the network (later part-ownership in 1996 when Viacom bought a 50% stake of the network)—making it the second network-owned station in the Twin Cities (alongside CBS-owned WCCO-TV). Over time, KMSP became one of UPN&#x27;s most successful affiliates in terms of viewership. In addition to UPN&#x27;s prime-time schedule and the network&#x27;s daytime children&#x27;s blocks (such as UPN Kids from 1995 to 1999, and &quot;Disney&#x27;s One Too&quot; from 1999 to 2003), the station was still enjoying success with local sports programming featuring the Minnesota Twins, as well as the MSHSL championships. KMSP was stripped of its status as a UPN owned-and-operated station in 2000 after Viacom exercised a contractual clause to buy out Chris-Craft&#x27;s stake in the network, although the station remained with UPN as an affiliate for another two years. Around this time, Viacom bought CBS (and in turn, WCCO).

===Return to Fox as an owned-and-operated station===
News Corporation, through its Fox Television Stations subsidiary, agreed to purchase Chris-Craft Industries and its stations, including KMSP-TV, for $5.35 billion in August 2000 (this brought KMSP, along with San Antonio&#x27;s KMOL-TV and Salt Lake City&#x27;s KTVX, back under common ownership with 20th Century Fox); the deal followed a bidding war with Viacom. The sale was completed on July 31, 2001. While Fox pledged to retain the Chris-Craft stations&#x27; UPN affiliations through at least the 2000–01 season, and Chris-Craft agreed to an 18-month renewal for its UPN affiliates in January 2001, an affiliation swap was expected once KMSP&#x27;s affiliation agreement with UPN ran out in 2002, given Fox&#x27;s presumed preference to have its programming on a station that it already owned. Additionally, KMSP&#x27;s signal was much stronger than that of WFTC; it was a VHF station that had been on the air much longer than UHF outlet WFTC. Most importantly, Fox had been aggressively expanding local news programming on its stations, and KMSP had an established and competitive news department whereas WFTC&#x27;s news department did not begin operations until April 2001. The move was made easier when, in July 2001, Fox agreed to trade KTVX and KMOL (now WOAI-TV) to Clear Channel Communications in exchange for WFTC, a transaction completed that October.

The affiliation switch, officially announced in May 2002, occurred on September 8, 2002 (accompanied by a &quot;Make the Switch&quot; ad campaign that was seen on both stations), as Fox programming returned to KMSP-TV after a 14-year absence, while WFTC took the UPN affiliation; KMSP was the only former Chris-Craft station that was acquired and kept by Fox that did not retain its UPN affiliation. The station began carrying Fox&#x27;s entire programming schedule at that time, including the &quot;FoxBox&quot; children&#x27;s block (which later returned to WFTC as 4KidsTV, until the block was discontinued by Fox in December 2008 due to a dispute with 4Kids Entertainment). The affiliation swap coincided with the start of the 2002 NFL season; KMSP effectively became the &quot;home&quot; station for the NFL&#x27;s Minnesota Vikings as a result of Fox holding the broadcast rights to the National Football Conference (from 1994 to 2001, most Vikings games were aired on WFTC). Finally, in 2014, with the launch of &quot;Xploration Station&quot; which replaced &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot; which WFTC carried, KMSP-TV began clearing the entire Fox network schedule for good.

Since Fox has affiliates in most media markets and the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s syndication exclusivity regulations normally require cable systems to only carry a given network&#x27;s local affiliate, and Fox prefers only an area&#x27;s affiliate be carried as opposed to a distant station for rating tabulation purposes, KMSP was eventually removed from most cable providers outside the Twin Cities. By this time, these areas had enough stations to provide local Fox affiliates. KMSP thus effectively lost the &quot;regional superstation&quot; status it had held for almost a quarter-century, dating back to when it was an independent station. Due to the advent of digital television, many stations in smaller markets previously served by KMSP began operating UPN-affiliated digital subchannels towards the end of the network&#x27;s run to replace that network&#x27;s programming in those markets, which in turn became MyNetworkTV or CW affiliates.

On December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company, owner of KSTP-TV&#x27;s affiliated network ABC, announced its intent to buy KMSP-TV&#x27;s parent company, 21st Century Fox, for $66.1 billion; the sale, which closed on March 20, 2019, excluded KMSP-TV and sister station WFTC as well as the Fox network, the MyNetworkTV programming service, Fox News, Fox Sports 1, the Big Ten Network and the Fox Television Stations unit, which were all transferred to the newly formed Fox Corporation. Fox Sports North would be divested in a separate deal to Diamond Sports Group, made up of a joint venture of WUCW owner Sinclair Broadcast Group and Entertainment Studios.

==News operation==
KMSP presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 10 hours each weekday, four hours on Saturdays, and hours on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest newscast output among Minneapolis&#x27; broadcast television stations.

The station&#x27;s first news director and news anchor was Harry Reasoner when KMSP signed on (as KEYD-TV) in 1955. Despite the station&#x27;s focus on live coverage of news and sports, as well as awards from the University of Minnesota Journalism School and the Northwest Radio–TV News Association, KEYD&#x27;s newscasts were generally in fourth place in the ratings. After channel 9&#x27;s ownership changed in 1956, the news operation was closed down. News programming returned to the station after NTA bought KMGM-TV in 1957.

The station, which had long been a distant third to WCCO-TV and KSTP-TV in the Twin Cities news ratings, began an aggressive campaign in 1973 to gain ground against its competition. After a nationwide search, management hired Ben Boyett and Phil Bremen to anchor a newscast with a new set and format, known as &quot;newsnine&quot;. The new format did not really draw many new viewers, and the station&#x27;s low news budget, ill-conceived promotion, and frequent technical glitches, along with its network&#x27;s news division&#x27;s overall struggles and wire service before Roone Arledge took control, didn&#x27;t help matters. One botched campaign for a news series on venereal disease, in the spring of 1974, resulted in lawsuits from two young women that claimed that their likenesses were used in promos without their permission, thus damaging their reputations. By the fall of 1975, Boyett and Bremen would be gone, replaced by respected veteran newsman Don Harrison and the station&#x27;s first female anchor, Cathie Mann. These changes did little to take channel 9 out of third place, and despite ABC becoming the #1 network by 1977 and Arledge&#x27;s moves to increase ABC News&#x27;s prestige, KMSP&#x27;s newscasts still struggled.

After KMSP lost the ABC affiliation in 1979, the station&#x27;s news operation reduced to a more scaled-down 9 p.m. or post-sports-only newscast which was more manageable for KMSP to maintain at the time. It was paired with the syndicated &quot;Independent Network News&quot; in the early-to-mid-1980s. The newscast&#x27;s budget and ratings would increase by the end of that decade, with re-expansions of the news department into the morning and early evenings occurring in the mid-1990s.

By the end of the decade, &quot;Minnesota 9 News&quot; was competitive with the other stations in the market, especially with its all-local morning newscast doing well against the network morning shows. This was despite KMSP being hamstrung by its UPN affiliation, which had seen several affiliates of the network cut or close their news departments through its decade of existence, due to the network&#x27;s overall and prime time ratings failing to meet expectations. Outside of UPN&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, the rest of the network&#x27;s programming schedule struggled outside of cities, a particular issue that affected KMSP as a statewide superstation with a wide rural footprint. This played into the station&#x27;s decision to eschew their owner-mandated &quot;UPN 9&quot; branding for the more neutral statewide branding of &quot;Minnesota 9&quot; (later, &quot;9 News&quot;) to promote their news department.

When KMSP rejoined Fox in 2002, the station&#x27;s prime time newscast, now with the stronger aid of Fox&#x27;s prime time lineup and sports coverage, frequently outrated the newscasts on KSTP-TV. Following Fox&#x27;s acquisition of WFTC in 2001, that station&#x27;s existing news operation was moved into an auxiliary studio of KMSP as part of a slow merger (including limited story-sharing); after Fox canceled channel 29&#x27;s newscast in 2006, some of WFTC&#x27;s staff moved in full to KMSP.

On May 11, 2009, KMSP became the second station in the Twin Cities (behind KARE-TV) to broadcast local newscasts in high-definition.

===Controversy===
On June 16, 2006, during one of the station&#x27;s newscasts, KMSP broadcast a &quot;video news release&quot; about convertibles produced by General Motors without required attribution that it was distributed by the auto giant. The narrator, MediaLink publicist Andrew Schmertz, was introduced as reporter André Schmertz. On March 24, 2011, the FCC levied a $4,000 fine against KMSP for airing the video news release without disclosing the corporate source of the segment to its viewers, following complaints filed by the Free Press and the Center for Media and Democracy in 2006 and 2007.

==Technical information==
&lt;section begin=subchannels /&gt;
===KMSP-TV/WFTC subchannels===
The signal of KMSP-TV contains six subchannels, while WFTC&#x27;s signal contains four. Through the use of virtual channels, WFTC&#x27;s subchannels are associated with channel 9.
In November 2009, KMSP began broadcasting a standard definition simulcast of WFTC on its second subchannel (virtual channel 29.2), with WFTC&#x27;s adding a standard definition simulcast of KMSP on its second subchannel (virtual channel 9.2) in turn. This ensures the reception of both stations, even in cases where the digital channels that KMSP and WFTC operate are not actually receivable.

On June 19, 2014, KMSP-TV announced plans that, effective June 24, 2014, they would broadcast their 9.1 virtual channel via RF channel 29 (with RF channel 9 mapping to 9.9) to take advantage of its broader coverage area and allow viewers with UHF-only antennas to receive the station in high definition. The Minneapolis–St. Paul market is unique in that all three television duopolies in the market, which besides KMSP/WFTC, include Twin Cities PBS stations KTCA/KTCI and Hubbard Broadcasting&#x27;s KSTP and KSTC, have merged their various signals onto the same VHF channel slots for easier viewer reference (with all but KMSP-TV transmitting on UHF). KMSP and WFTC unified all of their over-the-air channels as virtual subchannels of KMSP. As a result, the virtual channels of WFTC changed to 9.

===KFTC subchannels===

&lt;section end=subchannels /&gt;
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KMSP-TV originally broadcast its digital signal on UHF channel 26, which was remapped as virtual channel 9 on digital television receivers. The station shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 9, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 26 to VHF channel 9 for post-transition operations.

===Broadcasting facilities===
The KMSP TV Tower is located in Shoreview, Minnesota. KMSP owns the tower, which stands tall, but shares it with sister station WFTC and the Twin Cities PBS stations, KTCA and KTCI. Several FM stations are also on the tower: KQRS-FM (&quot;92 KQRS&quot;), KXXR (&quot;93X&quot;), KTCZ (&quot;Cities 97.1&quot;), KTIS-FM, KSJN, KFXN-FM (&quot;The Fan&quot;), KDWB, KEEY (&quot;K102&quot;), KMNB (&quot;102.9 The Wolf&quot;), and KZJK (&quot;104.1 Jack FM&quot;).

===Translators===
&lt;section begin=translators /&gt;

<text>Chateaubriand (; sometimes called chateaubriand steak) is a dish that traditionally consists of a large front cut fillet of tenderloin grilled between two lesser pieces of meat that are discarded after cooking. While the term originally referred to the preparation of the dish, Auguste Escoffier named the specific front cut of the tenderloin the Chateaubriand.

In gastronomy of the 19th century, the steak for Chateaubriand could be cut from the sirloin, and served with a reduced sauce named Chateaubriand sauce or a similar, that was prepared with white wine and shallots moistened with demi-glace, and mixed with butter, tarragon, and lemon juice. It was also traditionally served with mushrooms.

==Etymology and origins==

Chateaubriand is named after the French author François-René de Chateaubriand.

There are several stories about what the original dish was. With French origins, the &quot;Larousse Gastronomique&quot; indicates that the dish &quot;Chateaubriand&quot; was created by the namesake&#x27;s personal chef, Montmireil, for the Vicomte François-René de Chateaubriand, at that time (1822) Ambassador of France in The United Kingdom. Montmireil also created what was originally called &quot;pudding a la Chateaubriand&quot; but would eventually be called simply &quot;pudding diplomate&quot;. An alternative spelling of the Vicomte&#x27;s surname is &quot;Châteaubriant&quot;, which term the &quot;Dictionnaire de l&#x27;Académie des Gastronomes&quot; gives as the source of the beef-cattle bred at the town of Châteaubriant, in Loire-Atlantique, France.

Originally the term itself was applied to the manner of preparation of the meat; however, by the 1870s at its introduction to the English, the term was transferred to the steak or cut of meat itself. Steak originally called &quot;filet de bœuf&quot; was now served as Chateaubriand. Montmireil originally roasted the Chateaubriand between two lesser cuts of meat. This technique enhanced both flavor and juiciness of the steak.

===Classic preparations===
====Delmonico&#x27;s====

New York&#x27;s Delmonico&#x27;s Restaurant opened in 1827 as a pastry shop by Giovani and Pietro Delmonico but quickly expanded in 1830 to a full French restaurant. Louis Napoleon visited New York in 1837 and was a regular patron. Among the items on the first menu was &quot;Beef tenderloin with sauce.&quot; In 1893, Charles Ranhofer, the former chef at Delmonico&#x27;s Restaurant, described the exact cut of meat for his preparation method as being the center cuts of the beef tenderloin. This center loin is described by Ranhofer as having been given the name Chateaubriand. In this 1893 method, a twenty-ounce (pound and a quarter) tenderloin center is flattened to and broiled over a slow but steady fire for 16 minutes for exceptionally rare, 18 minutes for medium, and 20 minutes for well done. The finished steak is served with maître d&#x27;hôtel butter or gravy.

====Escoffier====

French chef Georges Auguste Escoffier gave names to different steak cuts. &quot;Tournedos&quot; were the name given for the kernels of the fillet, cut into rounds. Escoffier states:

Chateaubriands are obtained from the centre of the trimmed fillet of beef, cut two or three times the thickness of an ordinary fillet steak. However, when it is to be cooked by grilling the Chateaubriand should not be more than in weight as, if larger than this, the outside tends to become too dry and hard before the inside is properly cooked. In modern practice though, Chateaubriands are served with any of the sauces and garnishes suitable for Tournedos and fillet steaks.

While he gives the name to the cut of meat, Escoffier only mentions the Vicomte François-René de Chateaubriand as being the inventor of the sauce named after him. However, the Auguste Escoffier School of the Culinary Arts states:

Chateaubriand is actually a recipe which is usually grilled or broiled and served with Bearnaise and chateau potatoes, which are trimmed into olive shapes and sauteed in butter. It is normally cut from the center part of the tenderloin big enough for two people.
====Planked preparation and presentation====
In the February edition of the periodical &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; published in 1917, inside the article &quot;The Plank versus the Platter&quot; by Katherine Campion, the author states, &quot;Until very recently, a Beefsteak Chateaubriand was always cooked and served on an oaken plank. But now the custom of broiling the steak and serving it from a silver platter has replaced the plank&quot;. The publication credits Vicomte François-René de Chateaubriand for originating the cooking method for his meats and game which were served with rich sauces and garnishes. Oak planks add a substantial amount of flavor to the meat and are practical for both hotel and home cooking. Planks were sold both plain and with silver tray stands for presentation. Some well constructed planks had carved grooves for the juices to channel into a shallow well. The author&#x27;s instructions for preparation suggest thickly cut tenderloin, porterhouse, or rump steak. The meat is skewered into shape and broiled on one side. While the meat broils, the plank is placed into the hot oven to heat until smoking. When ready, remove the plank from the oven and butter. After the meat has cooked from 5 to 7 minutes, remove it from the broiler and place onto the plank, cooked side down. Mashed potatoes are then piped through a pastry bag with a rose tube directly onto the plank, surrounding the meat in a wavy border or other, more complicated, decoration. Stuffed bell peppers or, alternatively, stuffed tomatoes are arranged, one per person, pressed into the potato border. Sautéed mushrooms are added on top and the entire plank is placed back into a hot oven until the meat is cooked to liking and the potatoes are lightly browned and the vegetables tender. The meat is then seasoned with salt, pepper, and paprika with a little butter rubbed on the meat and a final garnishing with sprays of watercress is added.

==Modern preparations==
By the 1950s in the United States, Chateaubriand became a treat for upscale guests in Las Vegas, Nevada, eventually becoming a staple of the local supper clubs referred to as gourmet rooms that were found on and off the Las Vegas Strip. According to &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; magazine in 1966, &quot;A Chateaubriand steak in most modern restaurants is a thick slice of tenderloin, larded with beef fat or bacon, and broiled to the desired degree of doneness (&quot;à point&quot;, as the French say), then served up with Chateaubriand Sauce.&quot;

In the 1985 book, &quot;Contemporary Cooking&quot;, by James Charlton, the dish &quot;Chateaubriand with Duchesse Potatoes&quot; is prepared by broiling the steak until not quite done and then placing the nearly cooked steaks onto a plank surrounded with mushrooms, tomatoes, and piped duchess potatoes around the meat and vegetables and then placed back into the broiler for the steak to finish and the potatoes to lightly brown.

==Accompaniments==
* Maître d&#x27;hôtel butter

* Duchess potatoes

* Chateaubriand potatoes, also called chateau potatoes or &quot;pommes de terre château&quot; (potatoes sautéed in butter), is a -cut potato that is in length.
* Bouquetière or à la bouquetière is an arrangement of vegetables around a roast to resemble flowers. Carrots, turnips, and potatoes browned in butter with cauliflower in Hollandaise sauce are often used as well as glazed olive-turned vegetables (cut to a perfect barrel shape) with a sherry-flavoured jus lié (juice that has been lightly thickened) on the side.

===Sauces===
* Chateaubriand sauce (sometimes referred to as &quot;crapaudine sauce&quot;) is a culinary sauce that is typically served with red meat. It is prepared in a series of reductions, and typically accompanies Chateaubriand steak. Other dishes, such as &quot;tournedos villaret&quot; and &quot;villemer tournedos&quot;, also incorporate the sauce in their preparation. The origin of this sauce is subject to debate. Some credit its creation to chef Montmireil, while others speculate that it originated at the Champeaux restaurant following the publication of de Chateaubriand&#x27;s book, &quot;Itinéraire de Paris à Jérusalem&quot; (Itinerary from Paris to Jerusalem). The sauce is prepared with shallots, mushroom, thyme, bay leaf, tarragon, white wine, brown veal stock and beurre maître d&#x27;hôtel (sweet butter infused with parsley). Additional ingredients may include meat glaze, demi-glace, pan drippings, onion, lemon juice, cayenne pepper, peppercorn and salt. The preparation involves cooking all of the ingredients together except for the brown veal stock and beurre maître d&#x27;hôtel, until it is reduced by two-thirds of the original content. After this, the veal stock is added in proportions equal to the amount of wine that was originally used before the reduction, and this mixture is then reduced to half its size. The final step is for the mixture to be strained and then topped with chopped tarragon and beurre maître d&#x27;hôtel. The sauce is commonly served with Chateaubriand steak prepared and served with potatoes. A dish that incorporates Chateaubriand sauce is &quot;tournedos villaret&quot;, in which mushroom caps are filled with the sauce and placed atop tournedos, all of which are placed atop tartlets filled with kidney bean purée. The sauce is sometimes served in a separate side dish, rather than atop meats, such as with the dish &quot;villemer tournedos&quot;, which is prepared with fried tournedos placed atop fried chicken croquettes, along with tongue, mushroom and truffle.
* Béarnaise sauce is commonly served with Chateaubriand. &quot;Châteaubriand sauce béarnaise&quot; is described as a double fillet steak with béarnaise sauce and is served with pommes fondantes.
* Colbert sauce

<doc id="521673" wikidata="Q7337528" url="?curid=521673" title="River Itchen, Hampshire">
<text>The River Itchen in Hampshire, England, rises to the south of New Alresford and flows to meet Southampton Water below the Itchen Bridge. The Itchen Navigation was constructed in the late 17th and early 18th centuries to enable barges to reach Winchester from Southampton Docks, but ceased to operate in the mid-19th century and is largely abandoned today.

The river is one of the world&#x27;s premier chalk streams for fly fishing, amenable to dry fly or nymphing. The local chalk aquifer has excellent storage and filtration and the river has long been used for drinking water. Watercress thrives in its upper reaches.

Much of the river from its source to Swaythling is classified as a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and a Special Area of Conservation, of which the Hockley Meadows nature reserve is a part. The Itchen estuary is part of the separate Lee-on-The Solent to Itchen Estuary SSSI.

==Etymology and other name==
The name is likely from a Brittonic language and in meaning unknown. The settlement of Itchen Abbas, before its abbot&#x27;s ownership, is transcribed by early Middle English orthography which used the letter &quot;c&quot; followed by &quot;e&quot; or &quot;i&quot; to denote the sound and an &quot;e invariably after an n&quot; to avoid those down strokes being ambiguous thus, as &quot;Icene&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name, in upper parts was once seen as interchangeable with the tributary Alre.

==Course==
The source is north of Kilmeston, in that civil and ecclesiastical parish. The river flows north, through Cheriton village and east of overwhelmingly agricultural Tichborne village, before joining with tributaries the River Alre and Candover Brook immediately north-west of the town of New Alresford. The river then carves its way west passing the villages of Avington, Itchen Stoke, Itchen Abbas, Martyr Worthy, Easton, and Abbots Worthy; to enter the cathedral city of Winchester it crosses Winnall Moors to turn south for its remainder.
It flows in anabranches through the city, some close enough to Winchester Cathedral to cause problems to the foundations in the past. The main channel flows through Winchester City Mill and to the east of the city&#x27;s Roman walls, along a promenaded reach known as &quot;The Weirs&quot;.

Its waters can overflow into water-meadows, passing: the Hospital of St Cross; the villages of Twyford; Shawford; between the town of Eastleigh and the village of Bishopstoke; and through Itchen Valley Country Park before reaching the northern suburbs of Southampton at Mansbridge. Between Winchester and Mansbridge, sections were deepened or widened for the long-disused Itchen Navigation, and the former towpath forms part of the Itchen Way.

Monks Brook flows into the Itchen at Swaythling, and the river then passes under Woodmill Bridge and becomes tidal. Four further bridges cross it before the Test estuary in Southampton Water:
* Cobden Bridge, a road bridge connecting Bitterne Park and St Denys.
* Cobden railway bridge carrying the Southampton – Portsmouth railway line. Opened in 1866, the bridge is supported by two sets of cast iron cylinders resulting in three 115-foot openings. The bridge&#x27;s girders are made from wrought iron. In order to try to prevent the Northam Bridge Company from trying to block the bill authorising the railway, it was agreed that pedestrians would not be allowed to use the bridge. Even so the opening of the viaduct diverted traffic from other crossings with the Woolston Floating Bridge seeing a significant fall in income.
* Northam Bridge, a road bridge carrying the A3024 road from Bitterne Manor to Northam, which was originally opened in 1799.
* The Itchen Bridge, a high-level toll road bridge connecting the docks area with Woolston. This replaced the Woolston Floating Bridge (a chain ferry) which had previously crossed the river at this point.

Between the latter two, the river passes St Mary&#x27;s Stadium, the home of Southampton F.C. As the river meets Southampton Water it passes several rowing clubs, sailing clubs and the major mixed-development on the left bank in Woolston, called Centenary Quay.

==Watermills==

Surviving mills on the Itchen include Winchester City Mill (restored to working order by the National Trust), Abbey Mill, Winchester; converted to a restaurant, Wharf Mill, Winchester; converted to apartments, St Cross Mill, Winchester; converted to private dwellings, College Mill, Winchester; converted to a private dwelling, Hockley Mill, Winchester; converted to private dwellings, Gaters Mill, Southampton; converted to offices, and Woodmill, Southampton; now a recreational water activities centre and the limit of navigation. Sites of demolished mills include those at Durngate, Winchester; at the southern entrance to Winnall Moors Nature Reserve, St Catherine&#x27;s lock, Winchester and Shears Mill in Bishopstoke.

==Marinas and boatyards==

The lower part of the river is an important yachting centre and contains several marinas, sailing centres and boatyards. From seaward they are:

* Ocean Village Marina (MDL), on the western shore just below the Itchen Bridge and close to the city centre
* Southampton Water Activities Centre, almost underneath the bridge on the western shore
* Itchen Marine, just above the bridge, principally a towage business but with some berths for yachts and the only fuel berth in the river
* Merlin Boatyard, opposite Itchen Marine, on the eastern shore
* Lauren Marine Services, a small marina on the eastern side
* Ocean Quay and Solent Breeze Yacht Charter on the west side
* Shamrock Quay (MDL), the biggest marina in the river, also on the west
* Saxon Wharf (MDL) is almost adjacent to Shamrock Quay, containing the biggest boat lift in Britain (200t)
* Kemps Quay Marina on the eastern (now northern) shore, a drying marina and boatyard
* Quayside Marina, a single long pontoon next to Kemps
* Drivers Wharf, another single long pontoon, parallel to the shore, with a crane and boatyard

Above Northam Bridge, the limit of navigation for masted craft, are the Vespasian Road boatyard and numerous small establishments.

==Ecology==
The SSSI covers the river and its banks, with fen, flood meadows, wet woodland and swamp. It has populations of the nationally rare southern damselfly and white-clawed crayfish. Other fauna include otters, water voles, Atlantic salmon, shovelers and Cetti&#x27;s warblers.

===Water quality===
The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish, and chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations. Chemical status is rated good or fail.

Water quality of the River Itchen in 2022:
==In popular culture==
&quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;, a 1947 novel by Gladys Mitchell features the river.

<text>Altenburg () is a city in Thuringia, Germany, located south of Leipzig, west of Dresden and east of Erfurt. It is the capital of the Altenburger Land district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between Gera, Zwickau and Chemnitz with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000. Today, the city and its rural county is part of the Central German Metropolitan Region.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the Saale river (as part of the medieval Ostsiedlung movement). The emperor Frederick Barbarossa visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a Barbarossa town today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different Ernestine duchies, of whom the Saxe-Altenburg persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the Great Depression around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in East Germany and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the Lindenau-Museum, the historic city center (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the Gründerzeit architecture around the center. The popular German card game Skat was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous Brockhaus Enzyklopädie, Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus, lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of Osterland on the Pleiße river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of Saxony.

== History ==


=== Middle Ages ===
The town (&quot;civitas Altenburg&quot;) was first mentioned in a deed to the Bishop of Zeitz in 976. Remains of a Slavic castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of Meissen by Henry I. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area (Osterland) was mainly settled by Slavs.

The town&#x27;s location on the imperial road &#x27;Via Imperii&#x27; between Halle and Cheb in Bohemia gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the Battle of Hohenmölsen between Henry IV and Rudolph of Swabia. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century &quot;Mantelturm&quot; tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial palatinate and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the Harz-mountains and the Elbe.

In the middle of the 12th century, the Hohenstaufen emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their Kaiserpfalzes, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by Frederick Barbarossa, Altenburg, Colditz, Zwickau and Chemnitz were turned into the &quot;Terra Plisnensis&quot;. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A priory of canons regular was founded and the parish church was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustinian monastery (&quot;Rote Spitzen&quot;) are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from Goslar municipal law.

During the Interregnum, the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by Rudolph I of Germany, who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the Battle of Lucka in 1307 against Frederick the Brave of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King Albert I lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the Wettin margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (&quot;Altenburger Teilung&quot;) of the Meissen lands between Elector Frederick II (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (&quot;Hallescher Machtspruch&quot;) to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers (&quot;Bruderkrieg&quot;).
In the second division of the Wettin lands between Ernest and Albert at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (&quot;Kurland&quot;), Grimma, the Mutschener Pflege, Leisnig, Thuringia and the Vogtland. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The Reformation was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by George Spalatin, Wenzeslaus Linck and Gabriel Zwilling. During the German Peasants&#x27; War of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the Schmalkaldic War brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. The Thirty Years&#x27; War brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

From 1705 onwards, the Magdalenenstift was a Protestant boarding school for young noble ladies.

During the Napoleonic wars it was a scene of a brief Allied raid by the Saxon General Johann von Thielmann.

=== Since 1815 ===

When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of Saxe-Altenburg, successor state to the dissolved Saxe-Hildburghausen. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia&#x27;s first connected city). The Revolution of 1848 led to the abdication of the conservative duke Joseph, who was replaced by his more liberal brother George. The last duke abdicated during the Revolution of 1918 on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the Weimar Republic, ruled by SPD and KPD, which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the Kristallnacht in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During World War II, several subcamps of the Buchenwald concentration camp were located here. They provided 13,000 forced labourers for HASAG, the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour. The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks). Altenburg became part of the Leipzig administrative district, in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for Saxony in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the Schmölln district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day Altenburger Land district in 1994.

== Geography and demographics ==

=== Topography ===

Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the Leipzig Bay, a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and lignite surface mining north of the town. The nearest mountains are the Ore Mountains approximately to the south-east. The Pleiße valley runs east of the city, whereas the center itself is located at &quot;Blaue Flut&quot; (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the &quot;Großer Teich&quot; (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatively little forest within the town&#x27;s municipal territory: the small &quot;Stadtwald&quot; (town wood) and &quot;Herzog-Ernst-Wald&quot; (Duke Ernest wood) south of the center and the &quot;Fasanerieholz&quot; (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city center is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by Windischleuba, Nobitz, Altkirchen, Göhren, Lödla, Rositz, Meuselwitz, Treben and Gerstenberg.

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

&quot;For a detailed view of Altenburg&#x27;s administrative division, see the list in German Wikipedia.&quot;

=== Demographics ===

Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a Kaiserpfalz and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia&#x27;s second-largest city after Erfurt for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000 by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly declining urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are Windischleuba and Nobitz. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like Leipzig, Dresden or Jena. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia&#x27;s major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6). The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to 2011 EU census). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are Russians and Vietnamese people. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former GDR, most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the Evangelical Church in Central Germany and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed &quot;playing cards town&quot;. The game of skat is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian tarock. Because of the influence Emperor Frederick Barbarossa had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;Barbarossa town&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The &quot;Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum&quot; (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The &quot;Lindenau-Museum&quot; (established in 1876) shows Bernhard von Lindenau&#x27;s art collection including Italian paintings of the 13th–15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art. 
* The &quot;Mauritianum&quot; (opened in 1908) is Altenburg&#x27;s museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified rat king, which was found in 1828 in a miller&#x27;s fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The &quot;Brauereimuseum&quot; inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===

The town center of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around &quot;Brühl&quot; in the north-east and around St. Nicholas&#x27; Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in Gründerzeit style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings&#x27; maintenance was neglected during the East German period, instead, some big Plattenbau settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg&#x27;s main evangelical parish church.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===

Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the Loess soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is Altenburger Ziegenkäse, a soft cheese of goat milk with some caraway seed inside with protected Geographical indication. Another typical dish of Altenburg is Mutzbraten, a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like L. O. Dietrich (machines Vesta, Saxonia, Löwe, Minerva, Juno), Hermann Köhler AG (machines Köhler, Diva, Clementine, Hermann, Dora, Orion, Globus), Textima Wittenberge (Columba, Altin), Gustav Winselmann GmbH (Titan, Vera, Bera, Hera, Heraldus, Omnia, Marvel, Noris, Regia, Saxony, the Wellington).

Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of Vion NV amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur produced the Gumpert Apollo supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of Cartamundi and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn&#x27;t play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local center of culture with theater and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.

=== Transport ===

Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the Leipzig–Hof line. Initially, Altenburg station was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to Leipzig (1842) and Hof/Zwickau (1844), some more lines were established to Glauchau (1858, via Gößnitz), to Gera (1865, via Gößnitz), to Zeitz (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to Narsdorf (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to Leipzig, Zwickau and Erfurt (via Gera and Jena) today. Glauchau can be reached by changing trains in the near Gößnitz station. With the rollout of the Leipzig City Tunnel in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two Autobahns: the A4 (Erfurt–Dresden) passes approximately south and the A72 (Leipzig–Chemnitz) passes approximately east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three national roadsn in Altenburg. The B7 is the connection to Gera (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to Rochlitz in the north-east, the B93 runs to Borna (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to Zwickau in the south and the B180 links Altenburg with Zeitz in the west and Hohenstein-Ernstthal (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via Lumpzig. The B7 and B93 bypass the town center on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.
The Leipzig-Altenburg Airport, a former Soviet military airport, is situated east of the city and was used by Ryanair for flights to London Stansted, Barcelona-Girona and Edinburgh until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in Leipzig/Halle ( to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long-distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the &quot;Pleiße track&quot;, along the Pleiße valley from Werdau near Zwickau to Leipzig, and the &quot;Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)&quot; from Eisenach via Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three Gymnasiums in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

<text>In mathematics, Schur&#x27;s lemma is an elementary but extremely useful statement in representation theory of groups and algebras. In the group case it says that if &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are two finite-dimensional irreducible representations 
of a group &quot;G&quot; and &quot;φ&quot; is a linear map from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;N&quot; that commutes with the action of the group, then either &quot;φ&quot; is invertible, or &quot;φ&quot; = 0. An important special case occurs when &quot;M&quot; = &quot;N&quot;, i.e. &quot;φ&quot; is a self-map; in particular, any element of the center of a group must act as a scalar operator (a scalar multiple of the identity) on &quot;M&quot;. The lemma is named after Issai Schur who used it to prove the Schur orthogonality relations and develop the basics of the representation theory of finite groups. Schur&#x27;s lemma admits generalisations to Lie groups and Lie algebras, the most common of which are due to Jacques Dixmier and Daniel Quillen.

==Representation theory of groups==
Representation theory is the study of homomorphisms from a group, &quot;G&quot;, into the general linear group &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) of a vector space &quot;V&quot;; i.e., into the group of automorphisms of &quot;V&quot;. (Let us here restrict ourselves to the case when the underlying field of &quot;V&quot; is formula_1, the field of complex numbers.) Such a homomorphism is called a representation of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;V&quot;. A representation on &quot;V&quot; is a special case of a group action on &quot;V&quot;, but rather than permit any arbitrary bijections (permutations) of the underlying set of &quot;V&quot;, we restrict ourselves to invertible &quot;linear&quot; transformations.

Let &quot;ρ&quot; be a representation of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;V&quot;. It may be the case that &quot;V&quot; has a subspace, &quot;W&quot;, such that for every element &quot;g&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, the invertible linear map &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) preserves or fixes &quot;W&quot;, so that (&quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;g&quot;))(&quot;w&quot;) is in &quot;W&quot; for every &quot;w&quot; in &quot;W&quot;, and (&quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;g&quot;))(&quot;v&quot;) is not in &quot;W&quot; for any &quot;v&quot; not in &quot;W&quot;. In other words, every linear map &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;g&quot;): &quot;V&quot;→&quot;V&quot; is also an automorphism of &quot;W&quot;, &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;g&quot;): &quot;W&quot;→&quot;W&quot;, when its domain is restricted to &quot;W&quot;. We say &quot;W&quot; is &quot;stable&quot; under &quot;G&quot;, or stable under the action of &quot;G&quot;. It is clear that if we consider &quot;W&quot; on its own as a vector space, then there is an obvious representation of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;W&quot;—the representation we get by restricting each map &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) to &quot;W&quot;. When &quot;W&quot; has this property, we call &quot;W&quot; with the given representation a &quot;subrepresentation&quot; of &quot;V&quot;. Every representation of &quot;G&quot; has itself and the zero vector space as trivial subrepresentations. A representation of &quot;G&quot; with no non-trivial subrepresentations is called an &quot;irreducible representation&quot;. Irreducible representations – like the prime numbers, or like the simple groups in group theory – are the building blocks of representation theory. Many of the initial questions and theorems of representation theory deal with the properties of irreducible representations.

Just as we are interested in homomorphisms between groups, and in continuous maps between topological spaces, we are also interested in certain functions between representations of &quot;G&quot;. Let &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; be vector spaces, and let formula_2 and formula_3 be representations of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; respectively. Then we define a map &quot;f&quot; from &quot;V&quot; to &quot;W&quot; to be a linear map from &quot;V&quot; to &quot;W&quot; that is equivariant under the action of &quot;G&quot;; that is, for every &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, formula_4. In other words, we require that &quot;f&quot; commutes with the action of &quot;G&quot;. maps are the morphisms in the category of representations of &quot;G&quot;.

Schur&#x27;s Lemma is a theorem that describes what maps can exist between two irreducible representations of &quot;G&quot;.

===Statement and Proof of the Lemma===
Theorem &quot;(Schur&#x27;s Lemma)&quot;: Let &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; be vector spaces; and let formula_2 and formula_3 be irreducible representations of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; respectively.
# If formula_7 and formula_8 are not isomorphic, then there are no nontrivial maps between them.
# If formula_9 finite-dimensional over an algebraically closed field (e.g. formula_1); and if formula_11, then the only nontrivial maps are the identity, and scalar multiples of the identity. (A scalar multiple of the identity is sometimes called a &quot;homothety.&quot;)

Proof: Suppose formula_12 is a nonzero map from formula_7 to formula_8. We will prove that formula_7 and formula_8 are isomorphic. Let formula_17 be the kernel, or null space, of formula_12 in formula_7, the subspace of all formula_20 in formula_7 for which formula_22. (It is easy to check that this is a subspace.) By the assumption that formula_12 is , for every formula_24 in formula_25 and choice of formula_20 in formula_17, formula_28. But saying that formula_29 is the same as saying that formula_30 is in the null space of formula_31. So formula_17 is stable under the action of &quot;G&quot;; it is a subrepresentation. Since by assumption formula_7 is irreducible, formula_17 must be zero; so formula_12 is injective.

By an identical argument we will show formula_12 is also surjective; since formula_37, we can conclude that for arbitrary choice of formula_38 in the image of formula_12, formula_40 sends formula_38 somewhere else in the image of formula_12; in particular it sends it to the image of formula_43. So the image of formula_38 is a subspace formula_45 of formula_8 stable under the action of formula_25, so it is a subrepresentation and formula_12 must be zero or surjective. By assumption it is not zero, so it is surjective, in which case it is an isomorphism.

In the event that formula_9 finite-dimensional over an algebraically closed field and they have the same representation, let formula_50 be an eigenvalue of formula_12. (An eigenvalue exists for every linear transformation on a finite-dimensional vector space over an algebraically closed field.) Let formula_52. Then if formula_20 is an eigenvector of formula_12 corresponding to formula_55. It is clear that formula_56 is a map, because the sum or difference of maps is also . Then we return to the above argument, where we used the fact that a map was to conclude that the kernel is a subrepresentation, and is thus either zero or equal to all of formula_7; because it is not zero (it contains formula_20) it must be all of &quot;V&quot; and so formula_56 is trivial, so formula_60.

===Corollary of Schur&#x27;s Lemma===

An important corollary of Schur&#x27;s lemma follows from the observation that we can often build explicitly formula_25-linear maps between representations by &quot;averaging&quot; over the action of individual group elements on some fixed linear operator. In particular, given any irreducible representation, such objects will satisfy the assumptions of Schur&#x27;s lemma, hence be scalar multiples of the identity. More precisely:

Corollary: Using the same notation from the previous theorem, let formula_62 be a linear mapping of &quot;V&quot; into &quot;W&quot;, and setformula_63Then,

# If formula_7 and formula_8 are not isomorphic, then formula_66.
# If formula_9 is finite-dimensional over an algebraically closed field (e.g. formula_1); and if formula_11, then formula_70, where &quot;n&quot; is the dimension of &quot;V&quot;. That is, formula_71 is a homothety of ratio formula_72.

Proof:
Let us first show that formula_71 is a G-linear map, i.e., formula_74 for all formula_75. Indeed, consider that

formula_76

Now applying the previous theorem, for case 1, it follows that formula_66, and for case 2, it follows that formula_71 is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix (i.e., formula_79). To determine the scalar multiple formula_80, consider that

formula_81

It then follows that formula_82.

This result has numerous applications. For example, in the context of quantum information science, it is used to derive results about complex projective t-designs. In the context of molecular orbital theory, it is used to restrict atomic orbital interactions based on the molecular symmetry.

== Formulation in the language of modules ==

Theorem: Let formula_83 be two simple modules over a ring formula_84. Then any homomorphism formula_85 of formula_84-modules is either zero or an isomorphism. In particular, the endomorphism ring of a simple module is a division ring.

Proof: Consider the kernel and image of formula_12: since formula_88 are submodules of simple modules, by definition they are either zero or equal to formula_83 respectively. In particular, we have that either formula_90, meaning that formula_12 is the zero morphism, or that formula_92, meaning that formula_12 is injective. In the latter case, the first isomorphism theorem tells us furthermore that formula_94 is not trivial and thus formula_95: this shows that formula_12 is in addition surjective, hence bijective and thus an isomorphism of formula_84-modules. 

The group version is a special case of the module version, since any representation of a group &quot;G&quot; can equivalently be viewed as a module over the group ring of &quot;G&quot;.

Schur&#x27;s lemma is frequently applied in the following particular case. Suppose that &quot;R&quot; is an algebra over a field &quot;k&quot; and the vector space &quot;M&quot; = &quot;N&quot; is a simple module of &quot;R&quot;. Then Schur&#x27;s lemma says that the endomorphism ring of the module &quot;M&quot; is a division algebra over &quot;k&quot;. If &quot;M&quot; is finite-dimensional, this division algebra is finite-dimensional. If &quot;k&quot; is the field of complex numbers, the only option is that this division algebra is the complex numbers. Thus the endomorphism ring of the module &quot;M&quot; is &quot;as small as possible&quot;. In other words, the only linear transformations of &quot;M&quot; that commute with all transformations coming from &quot;R&quot; are scalar multiples of the identity.

More generally, if formula_84 is an algebra over an algebraically closed field formula_99 and formula_100 is a simple formula_84-module satisfying formula_102 (the cardinality of formula_99), then formula_104. So in particular, if formula_84 is an algebra over an uncountable algebraically closed field formula_99 and formula_100 is a simple module that is at most countably-dimensional, the only linear transformations of formula_100 that commute with all transformations coming from formula_84 are scalar multiples of the identity. 

When the field is not algebraically closed, the case where the endomorphism ring is as small as possible is still of particular interest. A simple module over a formula_99-algebra is said to be absolutely simple if its endomorphism ring is isomorphic to formula_99. This is in general stronger than being irreducible over the field formula_99, and implies the module is irreducible even over the algebraic closure of formula_99. 

=== Application to central characters ===
Definition: Let formula_84 be a formula_99-algebra. An formula_84-module formula_100 is said to have &quot;central character&quot; formula_118 (here, formula_119 is the center of formula_84) if for every formula_121 there is formula_122 such that formula_123, i.e. if every formula_124 is a generalized eigenvector of formula_125 with eigenvalue formula_126.

If formula_127, say in the case sketched above, every element of formula_119 acts on formula_100 as an formula_84-endomorphism and hence as a scalar. Thus, there is a ring homomorphism formula_118 such that formula_132 for all formula_133. In particular, formula_100 has central character formula_135.

If formula_136 is the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra, a central character is also referred to as an infinitesimal character and the previous considerations show that if formula_137 is finite-dimensional (so that formula_138 is countable-dimensional), then every simple formula_137-module has an infinitesimal character.

In the case where formula_140 is the group algebra of a finite group formula_25, the same conclusion follows. Here, the center of formula_84 consists of elements of the shape formula_143 where formula_144 is a class function, i.e. invariant under conjugation. Since the set of class functions is spanned by the characters formula_145 of the irreducible representations formula_146, the central character is determined by what it maps formula_147 to (for all formula_146). Since all formula_149 are idempotent, they are each mapped either to 0 or to 1, and since formula_150 for two different irreducible representations, only one formula_149 can be mapped to 1: the one corresponding to the module formula_100.

==Representations of Lie groups and Lie algebras==
We now describe Schur&#x27;s lemma as it is usually stated in the context of representations of Lie groups and Lie algebras. There are three parts to the result.

First, suppose that formula_153 and formula_154 are irreducible representations of a Lie group or Lie algebra over any field and that formula_155 is an intertwining map. Then formula_156 is either zero or an isomorphism.

Second, if formula_7 is an irreducible representation of a Lie group or Lie algebra over an &quot;algebraically closed&quot; field and formula_158 is an intertwining map, then formula_156 is a scalar multiple of the identity map. 

Third, suppose formula_153 and formula_154 are irreducible representations of a Lie group or Lie algebra over an &quot;algebraically closed&quot; field and formula_162 are nonzero intertwining maps. Then formula_163 for some scalar formula_50.

A simple corollary of the second statement is that every complex irreducible representation of an abelian group is one-dimensional.

===Application to the Casimir element===
Suppose formula_137 is a Lie algebra and formula_166 is the universal enveloping algebra of formula_137. Let formula_168 be an irreducible representation of formula_137 over an algebraically closed field. The universal property of the universal enveloping algebra ensures that formula_170 extends to a representation of formula_166 acting on the same vector space. It follows from the second part of Schur&#x27;s lemma that if formula_20 belongs to the center of formula_166, then formula_174 must be a multiple of the identity operator. In the case when formula_137 is a complex semisimple Lie algebra, an important example of the preceding construction is the one in which formula_20 is the (quadratic) Casimir element formula_177. In this case, formula_178, where formula_179 is a constant that can be computed explicitly in terms of the highest weight of formula_170. The action of the Casimir element plays an important role in the proof of complete reducibility for finite-dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras.

== Generalization to non-simple modules ==

The one-module version of Schur&#x27;s lemma admits generalizations for modules formula_100 that are not necessarily simple. They express relations between the module-theoretic properties of formula_100 and the properties of the endomorphism ring of formula_100.

Theorem : A module is said to be strongly indecomposable if its endomorphism ring is a local ring. For a module formula_100 of finite length, the following properties are equivalent: 
* formula_100 is indecomposable;
* formula_100 is strongly indecomposable; 
* Every endomorphism of formula_100 is either nilpotent or invertible.

Schur&#x27;s lemma cannot be reversed in general, however, since there exist modules that are not simple but whose endomorphism algebra is a division ring. Such modules are necessarily indecomposable and so cannot exist over semisimple rings, such as the complex group ring of a finite group. However, even over the ring of integers, the module of rational numbers has an endomorphism ring that is a division ring, specifically the field of rational numbers. Even for group rings, there are examples when the characteristic of the field divides the order of the group: the Jacobson radical of the projective cover of the one-dimensional representation of the alternating group A5 over the finite field with three elements F3 has F3 as its endomorphism ring.

<text>Nereis is a genus of polychaete worms in the family Nereididae. It comprises many species, most of which are marine. &quot;Nereis&quot; possess setae and parapodia for locomotion and gas exchange. They may have two types of setae, which are found on the parapodia. Acicular setae provide support. Locomotor setae are for crawling, and are the bristles that are visible on the exterior of the Polychaeta. They are cylindrical in shape, found not only in sandy areas, and they are adapted to burrow. They often cling to seagrass (posidonia) or other grass on rocks and sometimes gather in large groups. 

Nereis worms are commonly known as rag worms or clam worms. The body is long, slender, and dorso-ventrally flattened, reaching a length of 5-30 cm. The head consists of two parts: a roughly triangular anterior lobe—the prostomium—and a posterior ring-like portion—the peristomium. The latter bears four pairs of tentacular cirri, dorsally two pairs of eyes, and ventrally a pair of short two-jointed palps.

== Etymology ==
The scientific Latin genus name &quot;Nereis&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek Νηρηΐς : Nērēís (stem Νηρηΐδ- : Nērēid), a sea nymph.

==Ecology==
&quot;Nereis&quot; are osmoconformers. They are dioecious (individuals are male or female) and they release their haploid gametes into the water, a process called &quot;spawning&quot;. Moreover, upon fertilization and mitotic divisions of the zygote, Nereids form a larval stage which is similar to that of molluscs – i.e. a trochophore larva.

<doc id="521713" wikidata="Q1368278" url="?curid=521713" title="Battle of Maychew">
<text>The Battle of Maychew () was the last major battle fought on the northern front during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. The battle consisted of a failed counterattack by the Ethiopian forces under Emperor Haile Selassie making frontal assaults against prepared Italian defensive positions under the command of Marshal Pietro Badoglio. The battle was fought near Maychew (Mai Ceu), Ethiopia, in the modern region of Tigray.

==Background==
On 3 October 1935, General Emilio De Bono advanced into Ethiopia from Eritrea without a declaration of war, leading a force of approximately 100,000 Italian and 25,000 Eritrean soldiers towards the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. In December, after a brief period of inactivity and minor setbacks for the Italians, De Bono was replaced by Badoglio.

Under Badoglio, the advance on Addis Ababa was renewed. Badoglio overwhelmed the armies of ill-armed and uncoordinated Ethiopian warriors with mustard gas, tanks, and heavy artillery. He defeated the Ethiopian armies at the Battle of Amba Aradam, the Second Battle of Tembien, and the Battle of Shire.

===Korem and Maychew===
On 1 March 1936, Emperor Haile Selassie arrived by foot at his new headquarters in Korem. He arrived forty years to the day from the decisive Ethiopian victory at Adwa during the First Italo-Ethiopian War. On 19 March, both &quot;Ras&quot; Kassa Haile Darge and &quot;Ras&quot; Seyum Mangasha made their way to Korem to join the Emperor. In addition, &quot;Ras&quot; Getachew Abate arrived with a fresh army from Kaffa Province. The Emperor divided his army into four groups. He arranged that one group would be commanded directly by himself and that the other three groups would be commanded by &quot;Ras&quot; Kassa, &quot;Ras&quot; Seyum, and &quot;Ras&quot; Getachew.

Compared to other Ethiopian forces, Haile Selasie&#x27;s army was extremely well armed. He had an artillery regiment of twenty 75mm field guns, some Oerlikon 37mm guns, and even a few 81mm Brandt mortars. However, compared to the resources available to Badoglio, Haile Selasie&#x27;s army was hopelessly outmatched. To even things up, the Emperor handed out between ten and fifteen dollars and distributed other gifts to the Oromo people of Raya Azebo (Italian: &quot;Azebu Galla&quot;). In exchange, they swore their allegiance to him and agreed to attack the Italian flanks.

Badoglio had the four divisions of the Italian I Army Corps and the three divisions of the Eritrean Corps at Maychew. Before the battle, the Marshal explained: &quot;The Emperor has three choices. To attack, and be defeated; to wait for our attack, and we will win anyway; or to retreat, which is disastrous for an army that lacks means of transport and proper organisation for food and munitions.&quot; Badoglio also enjoyed the intelligence edge of being able to intercept most of the Ethiopian radio communications, as well as the mobility of mechanized infantry.

On 21 March, Haile Selassie sent a radio message to his wife, Empress Menen Asfaw:
:&quot;Since our trust in our Creator and in the hope of His help and as we have decided to advance and enter the fortifications and since God is our only help, confide this decision in secret to the Abuna, to the ministers and to the dignitaries and offer unto God our fervent prayers.&quot;

As soon as Badoglio intercepted this message indicating that Haile Selassie had decided to advance, he cancelled orders for his own proposed offensive. Instead, Badoglio would prepare defensive positions for an Ethiopian attack.

On 23 March, looking across a lush green valley towards the Italian positions at Maychew, the Emperor contemplated his decision to strike first. His army was the last intact Ethiopian army between Badoglio and Addis Ababa. He decided he would direct the attack personally in accordance with tradition and the expectation of his followers. Six battalions of the Imperial Guard (&quot;Kebur Zabangna&quot;) would be part of his force of approximately 31,000 fighters. Haile Selassie chose to attack against the advice of his foreign experts and against his own better judgement.

Had Haile Selassie attacked on 24 March as he originally planned, things may have gone differently; many of the Italians had only recently arrived at Maychew after the fall of Amba Aradam. But, during a week frittered away by the Ethiopians in war councils, banquets, and prayers, the Italians had time to strengthen their defenses and time to bring up reserves.

==Battle==
At dawn on 31 March 1936, the attack was launched. It was St. George&#x27;s Day. The attack began at 0545 hours and continued for thirteen hours with little or no let up.

The Italians had been &quot;standing to&quot; in the front line positions all night, alerted to the attack by an Ethiopian deserter. The mountain troops (&quot;Alpini&quot;) of the 5th Alpine Division &quot;Pusteria&quot; were dug in on the slopes of Amba Bokora for the Italian I Corps. The rest of the I Corps was in reserve, the 26th Infantry Division &quot;Assietta&quot;, the 30th Infantry Division &quot;Sabauda&quot;, and the 4th CC.NN. Division &quot;3 Gennaio&quot;. The two Eritrean divisions of the Eritrean Corps held Mekan Pass, the 1st Eritrean Division and the 2nd Eritrean Division. The 1st CC.NN. Division &quot;23 Marzo&quot; was in reserve for the Eritrean Corps.

The Ethiopians advanced in three columns of 3,000 men each. In the first attacks, the Ethiopians hurled themselves at the Italian positions in waves. The fury of the attack and surprisingly accurate mortar fire carried the Ethiopians well into the defensive lines of the &quot;Pusteria&quot; Division. But the mountain troops struck back and soon the front lines were stabilized.

===Switch to the left flank===
The Ethiopians switched the focus of their attack and fifteen thousand men under &quot;Ras&quot; Kassa advanced against the Eritreans holding Mekan Pass on the Italian left flank. Haile Selassie hoped to face less resistance from the Eritreans. From 0700 to 0800 hours, the Ethiopians kept up a steady onslaught and, despite taking heavy casualties, were beginning to make gains. But at 0800 Badoglio unleashed the bombers of the Italian Royal Air Force (&quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;) and the Ethiopians could hear the ominous engine roar as they closed in with poison gas.

===Imperial Guard sent in===
Haile Selassie now played his trump card. The Imperial Guard, under the command of &quot;Ras&quot; Getachew Abate, was sent in against the Eritreans. The training and discipline of this elite force was apparent in the methodical mode of their advance over the open ground. For three hours they struggled to roll up the Italian flank. The X Battalion of the 2nd Eritrean Division was virtually annihilated. In the end, the Italian commander of the unit called down concentrated artillery fire onto his own overrun positions and saved the day.

===Last attack===
By 1600 hours, it was apparent that the Imperial Guard was not going to be able to capture their objectives and Haile Selassie played his last card. He ordered an attack along the entire front. This last desperate action was again made by three columns, it was made under a heavily overcast sky, and it was made with little chance of success. The Ethiopians attacked everywhere and were driven back. It was at this point that the Azebu Galla, who had been on the sidelines, made their allegiance clear and attacked the withdrawing Ethiopians.

Haile Selassie&#x27;s order to retreat was to be late in coming. He placed &quot;Ras&quot; Getachew Abate as &quot;Asmach&quot;. But the Ethiopians had lost many front line commanders, the soldiers had not eaten since before dawn, and discipline had understandably broken down. To make matters even worse, as the Ethiopians fled from the battlefield, they were mercilessly bombed from above by the Italian Royal Air Force and harassed on the ground by the Azebu Galla.

==After the battle==
On the evening of 31 March, Haile Selassie sent another message to his wife: 
:&quot;From five in the morning until seven in the evening our troops attacked the enemy&#x27;s strong positions, fighting without pause. We also took part in the action and by the grace of God remain unharmed. Our chief and trusted soldiers are dead or wounded. Although our losses are heavy, the enemy too has been injured. The Guard fought magnificently and deserve every praise. The Amhara troops also did their best. Our troops, even though they are not adapted for fighting of the European type, were able to bear comparison throughout the day with the Italian troops.&quot;

Many of the Ethiopian commanders now prepared to make for their own lands. &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Wondosson Kassa, one of &quot;Ras&quot; Kassa&#x27;s sons, was to go to Lasta south of Wag, his grandfather&#x27;s country. In Lasta the inhabitants were both warlike and loyal to the &quot;Shoan Emperor,&quot; Haile Selassie. &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Aberra Kassa, one of &quot;Ras&quot; Kassa&#x27;s other sons was to go to the Kassa fief of Salale in northern Shoa. &quot;Ras&quot; Seyum was ordered to return to Tigray and wage guerrilla war. &quot;Ras&quot; Kassa and &quot;Asmach&quot; Getachew, with the remnants of their own forces and with the remnants of the Guard, accompanied Haile Selassie as he made his way into the friendly highlands of Wag and Lasta and away from the snarling Oromos of Raya Azebo.

==Retreat==
On the night of 2 April, the Emperor finally ordered a retreat. The retreating columns set off before dawn the next day towards Lake Hashenge and the highlands of Korem. Haile Selassie, wearing a pith helmet, rode a white horse and the retreat was initially not chaotic. In the early morning, circumstances changed as two latent threats materialized. The Azebo Oromos started attacking the flanks and Italian aircraft arrived. The Imperial Guard, as part of the rear guard commanded by &quot;Asmach&quot; Getachew, lost more men over the next two days than were lost during the battle.

Late on 3 April, the Ethiopian columns reached Korem and the relative safety of the highlands. It was now decided that the columns would be dispersed. As a result, all semblance of order and organization were lost. In the early morning of 4 April, the battle weary and thirsty survivors of the Emperor&#x27;s army struggled towards Lake Ashangi. Roughly 20,000 Ethiopians crossed the open plain towards Lake Ashangi and, due to brutal attacks from the Azebo Oromos and due to near continuous attacks from the air, thousands would be lost before they got close to the lake&#x27;s shore. Worse, the water of Lake Ashangi had been sprayed with deadly chemicals by the Italian Royal Air Force and was poisoned by the time the Emperor&#x27;s army arrived, causing soldiers to die both from fumes and from drinking the water. Late on 4 April, Haile Selassie looked with despair upon the horrific sight of the dead bodies of much of his army ringing the poisoned lake.

===Pilgrimage to Lalibella and plan to stand at Dessie===
It was believed among the Ethiopians that it might be possible to make a stand at Dessie. The Crown Prince Asfa Wossen had been sent there to raise a new army. With the Crown Prince in Dessie were &quot;Shum&quot; Wadajo Ali and &quot;Fitawrari&quot; Fikremariam. Wadajo Ali was the &quot;real&quot; Governor of Wollo and Fikremariam commanded the Guard and the Shewan garrison at Dessie. Ammunition and supplies were accumulated in anticipation of protracted operations in the north.

Before getting to Dessie, the Emperor decided to make a pilgrimage to the holy city of Lalibella. Included in the Emperor&#x27;s retinue was Coptic &quot;Abuna&quot; Petros, Etchage Gabre Giyorgis, &quot;Ras&quot; Kassa, &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Adafersaw Yenadu, &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Wondosson Kassa, and &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Aberra Kassa. From 12 April the Emperor spent three days there in prayer. On 15 April, Haile Selassie left Lalibella and rejoined his army as it continued its plodding march towards Dessie. At Magdala, the Emperor was to learn that the Crown Prince had abandoned Dessie on 14 April without firing a shot. He also learned that the city was already occupied by the Eritreans. The Emperor&#x27;s column turned towards Worra Ilu, but runners then brought the news that Worra Ilu had fallen too. By forced march, the Emperor and his party made their way to Fikke in Salale.

On 20 April, Marshal Badoglio flew to Dessie. He noted great strips of cloth stretched across the decorated streets. On the cloth, the local population had written: &quot;The Hawk has flown.&quot;

On 26 April, when Badoglio launched his &quot;March of the Iron Will&quot; towards Addis Ababa, he faced no meaningful Ethiopian resistance.

===Addis Ababa===
From Fikke, Haile Selassie made his way towards Addis Ababa. By 1 May, he had arrived in the capital. This was one month after the Battle of Maychew. With him were &quot;Ras&quot; Kassa and &quot;Asmach&quot; Getachew. When the Emperor arrived, he found a city in a state of near panic.

<text>Harar (; Harari: ሀረር, ; ; , هَِرَِرْ; ), known historically by the indigenous as Harar-Gey or simply Gey (Harari: ጌይ, ݘٛىيْ, &quot;Gēy&quot;, ), is a walled city in eastern Ethiopia. It is also known in Arabic as the City of [[Wali|Saints]] ().

Harar is the capital city of the Harari Region. The ancient city is located on a hilltop in the eastern part of the country and is about from the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa at an elevation of .

For centuries, Harar has been a major commercial center, linked by the trade routes with the rest of Ethiopia, the entire Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Asia, and through its ports, the outside world. Harar Jugol, the old walled city, was listed as a World Heritage Site in 2006 by UNESCO in recognition of its cultural heritage. Because of Harar&#x27;s long history of involvement during times of trade in the Arabian Peninsula, the Government of Ethiopia has made it a criminal offence to demolish or interfere with any historical sites or fixtures in the city. These include stone homes, museums and items discarded from war. According to UNESCO, it is &quot;considered &#x27;the fourth holiest city&#x27; of Islam&quot; with 82 mosques, three of which date from the 10th century, and 102 shrines.

Yahyá Naṣrallāh&#x27;s &quot;Fatḥ Madīnat Harar&quot;, an unpublished history of the city in the 13th century, records that the legendary saint Abadir Umar ar-Rida and several other religious leaders settled in the Harar plateau (612 AH). Harar was later made the new capital of the Adal Sultanate in 1520 by the Sultan Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad. The city saw a political decline during the ensuing Emirate of Harar, only regaining some significance in the Khedivate of Egypt period. During the Ethiopian Empire, the city decayed while maintaining a certain cultural prestige.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the name &quot;Harar&quot; remains ambiguous; however, archaeologist Timothy Insoll suggests that it may be derived from Harla, an ancient group that existed prior to the arrival of the Oromo people in the area. Other possible etymologies include ones put forth by British explorer Richard Francis Burton who states Harar is an extract of the name of a plain located south of the town or a specific tree.

==History==
===Origins===
When Harar was founded is unclear and various dates have been suggested, some state the city was founded by Hadhrami settlers in the late 7th century or a local creation in the 10th century. Islam had gained a foothold on the Harar plateau by the 10th–11th centuries CE via trade with Zeila. By the 13th century, Islam had become the predominant religion in the region.

It is likely the original inhabitants of the region were the Harla people. Harar was part of the Harla Kingdom&#x27;s domain in the sixth century. In the Islamic period, the city was under an alliance called the confederated states of Zeila. According to the 12th-century Jewish traveler Benjamin of Tudela, the Zeila was the land of the Havilah, confined by al-Habash in the west. In the ninth century, Harar was under the Maḥzūmī dynasty&#x27;s Sultanate of Shewa.

According to the semi-legendary text &quot;Fatḥ Madīnat Harar&quot;, the founder of the city was saint Abadir Umar ar-Rida, who along with 405 other saints such as Aw Barkhadle, Isma&#x27;il al-Jabarti and Umardin bin Qutbaddan came from the Arabian Peninsula to settle in the Harar plateau and founded the city circa 612H (1216 CE). Abadir was supposedly met by the Argobba, the Gaturi and the Harla people who accepted his leadership. In 1234, Abadir returned back to Mecca where he stayed until 1279. In the meantime Harar was ruled by several other saints, most of whom were killed fighting the Christians. Coming back from Mecca, Abadir continued to fight the Christians until his final victory over them in 1301. According to tradition, Abadir&#x27;s brother Fakr ad-Din founded the Sultanate of Mogadishu, while one of his descendants founded the Hadiya Sultanate.

The first mention of Harar comes from the 14th-century chronicles of Amda Seyon I, according to this text, in 1332 Gēt (Harar) sent 3 &quot;makonnen&quot; (governors) to support Salih in his rebellion against the Emperor at the Battle of Das. This reference suggests that Harar had obtained some importance by the first half of the 14th century. The region became the base for the Walashma after their return from Yemen in 1415 with the foundation of the Adal Sultanate. The Walashma rulers established their residence in nearby Dakkar, which was likely in very close proximity to Harar.

Tradition states the Siltʼe, Wolane, Halaba and Harari people lived in Harar, while the former three moved to the Gurage region.

===Adal Sultanate (1520–1647)===

In 1520, the city became the capital of the Adal Sultanate under Sultan Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad after his victory over the religious faction led by Abun Adashe. At this point, the religious faction fighting against the Walashma came under the control of Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi also known as &quot;Gragn&quot; or &quot;Gurey&quot;, both meaning &quot;the Left-handed&quot;. The town&#x27;s clergy attempted to mediate between both sides, but the Imam was strengthened by a recent victory over an Ethiopian raid, and was able to defeat and killed the Sultan in 1525. Imam Ahmad then installed Umar Din as a puppet sultan and made Harar the center of his various campaigns which ravaged most of Christian Ethiopia.

After Imam Ahmad&#x27;s defeat in 1543, his men were dispersed back to the region of Harar. The dead leader’s widow, Bati del Wambara, undertook to renew jihad against the Christians. She invaded the highlands in 1548, but repulsed by Ras Fanu&#x27;el. In 1551, Nur ibn Mujahid married Bati del Wambara and became the new ruler of Harar. In 1559 he departed on a jihad (holy war) to Fatagar, during his absence, the Ethiopians under Ras Hamalmal breached the city and killed the last Walashma Sultan Barakat ibn Umar Din. However this victory was short-lived as Nur was able to defeat and kill Gelawdewos at the Battle of Fatagar, and brought his head back to Harar in triumph.

The following years were very difficult for Harar, as the Oromo were able to intrude on Hararghe and defeated Nur&#x27;s army at the Battle of Hazalo. This prompted Nur to construct a large wall around Harar, which served as a successful bulwark against the Oromo who devastated only the lands around Harar and forced Nur to fight them multiple times. Because of the influx of refugees into the town and the devastation of the region by the Oromo, Harar experienced two severe famines. The prices of food and livestock rose significantly: one &quot;sa&#x27;a&quot; (a unit equal to four handfuls) of sorghum cost 12 &quot;ashrafi&quot;s, and an equal amount of salt cost 15. A cow cost over 300 ashrafis. The second famine was followed by a plague which eventually killed Nur in 1568, three months after he conducted a campaign against the Oromo.

After the death of Nur ibn Mujahid, for the next following decade Harar would fall into a state of political instability, mainly due to the pressures of the Oromo. Nur was succeeded by Uthman the Abyssinian, who soon came into conflict with the &quot;ulama&quot; as he did not strictly observe sharia among the nobility and had made a humiliating peace agreement with the pagan Oromo by granting them special privileges. A local official of Aussa named Jibril denounced what he considered Uthman&#x27;s transgressions against Islamic law. The conflict came to a head when a local Muslim woman who had been taken by the pagan Oromos arrived as a refugee to Aussa. Uthman ordered Jibril to return the woman to the Oromos, Jibril refused, declaring that doing so would be contrary to God&#x27;s law. Uthman dispatched an army against Jibril, who was defeated and killed. However, while Uthman was gone the clergymen of Harar elected Talha ibn Abbas as the new leader, he was then able to ambush and defeat Uthman, which led to much rejoicing in the city.

However Tahla Abbas was again overthrown by some of his very fanatical subjects who still longed for a jihad against Ethiopia. He was replaced by Nasir ibn Uthman, who was almost immediately succeeded by his son, Muhammad ibn Nasir. He led an unsuccessful fight against the Christians, he met Emperor Sarsa Dengel at the Battle of Webi River but was betrayed by his own officers, which led him to get captured and executed by the Emperor with other Harari officials. While he was gone, Harar was attacked by the Oromos, his brother, wazir Hamid ibn Nasir was not able to repulse him, and was wounded in the fight. As a result, a local official named Mansur ibn Muhammad, recruited bands of Somali warriors and repel the Oromo attack, and then subsequently declared himself sultan. After repelling the Oromos, he then turned north against the governor of Aussa, but was attacked and killed by his own soldiers. Muhammad Gasa, a descendant of Ahmad Gragn, took advantage of the situation and moved the capital to Aussa, thus founding the Imamate of Aussa, from then on Harar was ruled by a local wazir.

The first wazir to govern Harar under the Imamate of Aussa was Muhammad Gasa&#x27;s own brother, Muhammad Gasa II, who later became the Imam in Aussa in 1584. The next year, Harar was ruled by wazir Saddadin, who participated in the war between Muhammad Gasa II and his minister Abbas ibn Muhammad. After this, mentions of Harar in the historical record is sporadic, with the exception of the names of some of its rulers, the first being Sabraddin ibn Adam (1620–5), Sadiq (1632–46) and his son Abram, who only ruled for eleven months.

===Harar Emirate (1647–1875)===

A certain Emir Ahmed, the son of Wazir Abram, had reigned for 10 days when `Ali ibn Da`ud assumed the throne of Harar, thus founding the Emirate of Harar. `Ali ibn Da`ud had risen through the ranks with previous occupations such as being a head of a district and the minister, had declared independence and founded a dynasty that would rule the city for the next two centuries. The reign of Ali saw significant problems with the neighboring Oromos, as on 1 September 1662 Emir Ali ibn Da&#x27;ud had to face a violent Illamo Oromo raid which, had reached as near as Asmadin gate and killed his son Sabr ad-Din ibn al-Amir &#x27;Ali b. Da&#x27;ud. Ali&#x27;s successor, Abdullah, significantly improved relations with the Oromos through an extensive marriage policy by marrying 5 of his sons to Oromo women. The Oromos by now had adopted agriculture and conducted trade with the inhabitants of Harar, allowing them to buy imported goods at the markets of the town. With this, the economic influence of Harar extended from Shewa to the west and Zeila to the east, with some overseas connections. The Emirate of Harar also began to mint its own currency, the earliest possible issues bearing a date that may be read as 615 AH (1218/19 CE); but the first coins were definitely issued by 1789 CE, and more were issued into the 19th century.

Harar began to develop into a major religious center in the region, serving as a source of Islamic proselytization to the surrounding Oromo tribes. In 1761 Ahmad I ibn Abi Bakr constructed the minaret of the grand mosque, and ʽAbd al-Shakur ibn Yusuf built a mosque in Bale. Abd al-Shakur also reintroduced the register and the chancery in the town, which strengthen the influence of the clergy. The religious importance of Harar can be further seen in the migration of various sharifs from Mecca to the town around the same time.

After the death of Emir Ahmad II ibn Muhammad in 1821, a new conflict arose between the brothers ʽAbd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad and ʽAbd al-Karim ibn Muhammad, which gave the surrounding Oromo and Somali tribes an opportunity to interfere in Harari politics. In 1825, the Oromo imprisoned ʽAbd ar-Rahman in Fedis, he then fled to the Somali tribe of Bersub. In the end, ʽAbd ar-Rahman was deposed and forty villages are listed as having been destroyed by the Oromo to the north, west and south of Harar during the civil war. Harar became the home of numerous Somali scholars who came to the city to study the most notable being Sheikh Madar founder of Hargeisa. Until the 1840s, the balance between Oromo and Somali influence led Harar to significantly expand economically, developing ties with Sharmarke Ali Saleh on the Somali coast. During this period slaves of Sidama and Gurage stock were important commodities exported to the coast. However, at the end of Abu Bakr II ibn ʽAbd al-Munan&#x27;s reign in 1852, the Oromo once again attacked Harar, possibly due to drought. Abu Bakr was forced to pay tribute to the Oromo, which led to an economic crisis and a devaluation in the Harari currency. During the reign of Ahmad III ibn Abu Bakr, Harar was once more besieged by the Oromo for 18 months until Ahmad III agreed to let the Oromo merchants enter the town with their weapons. When Ahmad III died without an heir to his throne, the Oromo helped place Muhammad ibn &#x27;Ali &#x27;Abd ash-Shakur in power.

Around this time, Harar was visited by the famous British traveler Richard Francis Burton, he describes Harar during his visit in 1855:
Muhammad is said to have oppressed his own people by devaluing the city&#x27;s currency while extracting a special &quot;mahalaq al-Oromo&quot; or Oromo tax. This tax was needed for Emir Muhammad to meet the demands of hospitality inherent in the status of &quot;ilman gosa&quot;. Richard Pankhurst also notes that Emir Muhammad forbade his subjects from eating rice or dates, &quot;declaring that they were suitable only for rulers.&quot; However, Caulk points that Muhammad engaged in a new policy: instead of simply keeping the Oromo at bay, he &quot;made systematic efforts to convert them to Islam and extend their involvement in commercial agriculture; he thereby attempted to assimilate more of the Oromo and re-establish the balance on which the town&#x27;s survival depended.&quot; Until the 1830s, only the Babile Oromo and groups of mixed Oromo-Somali ethnicity had been converted to Islam to any degree. Nonetheless, Muhammad lack the power to make much headway in this endeavor, and it was only after the Egyptian conquest that this policy made major strides.

===Egyptian occupation (1875–1885)===

Due to the oppressive emir in Harar the Harari opposition requested Egypt intervene to liberate the people in the region. In October 1878, Muhammad Rauf Pasha led a well armed Egyptian force of 1,200 men into the interior of eastern Ethiopia and without encountering any opposition, seized Harar on 11 October 1875. A few days later, Emir Muhammad was murdered by an Egyptian bashi-bazouk while leading evening prayers, his relatives then fled to the countryside to seek refuge among the neighboring Oromos.

The Egyptians spent much of their time establishing their authority over the surrounding Oromo to secure the caravan routes and attempt the agricultural exploitation of Harar&#x27;s hinterlands. Rauf Pasha conducted brutal expeditions in the countryside from February to March 1876. Despite this, the Egyptians were never able to pacify the Oromos, and effective Egyptian control rarely reached further than 40 miles away from the city. To strengthen their tenuous control of Harar, the Khedive increased its garrison to 160 officials, 3,411 soldiers and 5,000 of their wives and children. This garrison represented a fifth of Harar&#x27;s entire population, and the soldiers were usually quartered among the local populace. The imposition of substantial taxes in Harar incited protests from the Harari people against the Egyptian occupation, prompting British administrator Charles George Gordon to intervene in 1878 to remove Governor Rauf Pasha from his position. Researcher Alice Moore-Harell indicates that before Gordon&#x27;s arrival, the atmosphere had grown strained, with certain Egyptian soldiers aligning themselves with the local populace and declining to follow the governor&#x27;s directives.

The Egyptian period witnessed the reconstruction and enlargement of the city&#x27;s infrastructure. Under the governor Nadi Pasha, the height of the walls were increased. The old palace of the Emirs was demolished and erected in its place was a two-story governor&#x27;s house which looked over the marketplace and dominated the entire settlement. The town&#x27;s main mosque was also torn down and replaced with a somewhat larger structure. The Egyptians also built a much needed hospital near the south western gate under Ridwan Pasha. During the period of Egyptian rule, Arthur Rimbaud lived in the city as the local functionary of several different commercial companies based in Aden; he returned in 1888 to resume trading in coffee, musk, and skins until a fatal disease forced him to return to France. A house said to have been his residence is now a museum.

The Egyptian occupation of Harar came to an end as a result of the British conquest of Egypt and the Mahdist revolt. These developments produced a crisis in 1884 when the Egyptian government&#x27;s payments to the troops ceased to arrive, the garrison was forced to raid the Oromos and Somalis for food. In accordance with an agreement with another power in the region namely France, the UK was forced to withdraw its Egyptian forces from Harar. The Egyptian troops duly moved out of the city, taking some valuables with them, but leaving most of their local families behind. The Emirate was thus restored under Emir Abdullahi in 1885, however Emir Abdullahi&#x27;s rule was short lived for in 1887 Menelik II would defeat him at the Battle of Chelenqo and thus conquer the walled city.

===Abyssinian rule (1887–1936)===
In 1887, the army of Menelik II would conquer Harar after defeating Emir Abdullahi&#x27;s troops at Chelenqo, then appointed his nephew Ras Makonnen as governor of the region. According to Jules Borelli, after Menelik&#x27;s departure many of the Shewan troops quartered in the city were said to have looted the silos in which the inhabitants had stored their grain. Some of those robbed appealed to Makonnen, who promised restitution, but Borelli believes they never received any. Makonnen had ordered the primary mosque of Harar torn down and replaced it with an Orthodox Church designed by an Italian architect. The French traveler Charles Michel notes that &quot;the first years of the Abyssinian occupation were far from prosperous&quot; as &quot;the Abyssinian chiefs took for themselves what could have any value&quot;, while &quot;the soldiers, several thousand in number, chased the Hararis from their dwellings to install themselves in their place, and devastated everything around them.&quot; Traders were driven away and markets becoming impossible in towns were held instead in the remote countryside.

Harar lost some of its commercial importance with the creation of the French-built Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway, initially intended to run via the city but diverted north of the mountains between Harar and the Awash River to save money. As a result of this, Dire Dawa was founded in 1902 as &quot;New Harar&quot;. The British planned to revitalise the historic Harar-Berbera trade route by connecting the two cities via rail as a means to bolster trade. However, the initiative was vetoed by parliament on the grounds that it would harm the Entente Cordiale between France and Britain.

Unlike with most other subjugated lands in the south, Harar&#x27;s pre-conquest government employed literacy as a tool of governance. Therefore Ras Makonnen did not attempt to destroy them, but choose to inherit the long established administrative structures and official archives. The retention of historically developed administrative structure was an attempt to govern the province as inexpensively as possible. Nevertheless, with the arrival of settlers from Shewa into the region social tensions ensured, especially when Harar came to be regarded as the support base for Lij Iyasu. By the 1920s, the previously dominate position held by Hararis was beginning to be replaced by Christian immigrants, who extended their land holdings in the city by granting the Hararis large and unpayable loans. To stem the tide of land confiscations, a group of Harari elites established a group called the &quot;firmac&quot;. The goal of the &quot;firmac&quot; was to protect Harari property and maintain ethnic unity by discouraging un-Islamic practices. They also opened the first Islamic school in Harar that taught modern subjects.

===Italian occupation and aftermath (1936–1948)===

Harar was captured by the 29th Infantry Division &quot;Piemonte&quot; on 8 May 1936 under Marshall Rodolfo Graziani during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. The Italian invasion of Ethiopia was generally welcomed by Harar, who had grown to resent the Christian Amhara rule, the Italian policy of pitting different ethnic and religious groups had resonated with the Hararis. Under the Italians, mosques were built, the use of Arabic was encouraged, Hararis and other Muslim collaborators were hired by the Italian administration and previously confiscated land was returned to their original owners and descendants. Harar would serve as the capital of Harar Governorate, one of the Italian governors of Harar was Enrico Cerulli (1939–1940).

During the East African Campaign, Italian rule would almost immediately disintegrate and Harar was captured by the 1st battalion of the Nigeria Regiment, advancing from Jijiga by way of the Marda Pass on 29 March 1941. The freedom granted to Harar by the Italians was not quickly forgotten, especially after Emperor Haile Selassie attempted to restore the political and economic power of the Shewan elites. When the Somali Youth League (SYL) began agitating Harari members, they started their own branch known as &quot;Kulubi&quot;. The Ethiopian government immediately cracked down on this movement, arresting suspected members, confiscating property and imposing travel restrictions. This had a significant affect as for the first time in history, Hararis began migrating out of the city in large numbers, mainly to Dire Dawa and Addis Ababa, but also eventually abroad to Europe and North America, creating a large Harari diaspora.

===Present (1948–)===

Following the aftermath of World War II, the city saw the construction of a high school and a military academy. With the rise of the Derg in the 1970s, Harari disatsifcation remained high, Derg officials appropriating Harari property and forcibly conscripting Harari youth into the army saw further migration abroad, specifically to Canada and the United States.

After the rise of the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) in the early 1990s, Hararis were encouraged to use their language in official capacities. Considerable effort was taken to develop Harari as an official educational and administrative language. This saw a general cultural revival in Harar, with also stressed the importance of Islam. The complex social interactions of Sufi rituals at Harar&#x27;s numerous shrines both refied local Islamic identity and attracted large numbers of Muslim Ethiopian tourists. By 1994, two political parties were vying over power in Harar, one being the Harari National League (HNL) and the Harari Democratic Unity Party. After a tense competition which occasionally descended into violence, the HNL was able to seize power.

Tensions persist between the Harari people and the neighboring Oromo community, as the Oromo have taken possession of certain agricultural lands belonging to the Harari in the area surrounding Harar. In 2018, Tom Gardner reported that the Qeerroo Oromo nationalists took control of the city, demanding millions of Ethiopian birr as a condition for restoring water supplies to the residents of Harar.

==Culture==
According to Sir Richard Burton Harar is the birthplace of the khat plant. The original domesticated coffee plant is also said to have been from Harar.

==Climate==
The climate of Harar is classified as subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;) in Köppen-Geiger climate classification system.

Throughout the year, afternoon temperatures are warm to very warm, whilst mornings are cool to mild. Rain falls between March and October with a peak in August, whilst November to February is usually dry.

==Demographics==

Based on the 2007 national census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), Harar city had a total urban population of 99,368, of whom 49,727 were men and 49,641 women. The six largest ethnic groups reported in Harar were the Amhara (40.55%), the Oromo (28.14%), the Harari (11.83%), the Gurage (2.94%), the Somali (6.82%), and the Tigrayans (2.76%); all other ethnic groups together comprised less than 2% of the population. Amharic was spoken as a first language by 49.2% of city inhabitants, Oromo by 23.7%, Harari by 12.2%, and Somali by 6.6%. The plurality of urban inhabitants professed Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 48.54% of the population having reported they practiced that belief, while 44.56% of the population said they were Muslim, and 6.14% were Protestant. 

===Ethnicity===

Barker Haines reported in 1840 that the majority of the population of Harar were Hararis however a few Oromo, Afar, Somali and Arabian traders of Yemen were also present. In 1855 Richard Francis Burton described Harar as having an approximately 8,000 inhabitants; 3,000 Bedouins (referring to seasonal nomads who &quot;come and go&quot;, 2,500 Hararis, and 2,500 Somalis. Burton further reported a large Oromo presence leading to the town. During his visit in the Khedivate of Egypt occupation of the Emirate of Harar, researcher Paultischke describes Harar as having roughly 40,000 inhabitants with 25,000 of these being Hararis, 6,000 Oromo, 5,000 Somalis, 3,000 Abyssinians as well as a minority of Europeans and Asians.

After the conquest of the Emirate of Harar by the Ethiopian Empire, an influx of Amhara settled in Harar and its surroundings. The Somali population of the town was decimated following the overthrow of Lij Iyasu by Abyssinian militias. The indigenous Harari natives who once were majority within the walled city are under 15%, due to ethnic cleansing by the Haile Selassie government. As a result of the repression by the Ethiopian regime, in the late 1970s Hararis residing in Addis Ababa outnumbered those in Harar. According to Feener, the Harari have not recovered from the 1948 state-led crackdown on their population.

The Somali tribes surrounding Harar are mainly from the Gadabuursi and Issa subclans of the Dir and the Karanle subclan of the Hawiye. They represent the most native Somali clans in the region. The Darod clans of the Geri and Jidwaaq also inhabit areas near Harar. The Gadabuursi and Geri Somali strike immediately north and north eastwards of the town. Richard Francis Burton (1856) describes the Gadabuursi and Geri Somali clans as extending to within sight of Harar. The Issa and Karanle Hawiye strike north and north westwards whilst the Jidwaaq strike eastwards.

I.M. Lewis (1998) states:
&quot;Including the land round Harar and Dire Dawa inhabited by the Somalis of the &#x27;Iise and Gadabuursi clans.&quot;

==City layout==

The old walled city of Harar is divided into 5 quarters: Assum Bari, Argobba Bari, Suqutat Bari, Badro Bari, and Asmadin Bari. These quarters are then further divided into neighborhoods called &quot;toya&quot;, which are often named after a Muslim shrine or a prominent tree serving as a local landmark. According to S.R. Waldron, there were 59 such neighborhoods around 1975.

In the late 1960s, it was still possible to walk around the outside of the city walls on foot; doing so took about an hour. By the early 1980s, though, this was no longer possible because the city had begun to expand out from the walled city, with some buildings being built directly attached to the outside of the wall.

===Walls and gates of Harar===
The Old City of Harar with an approximate area of is surrounded by ramparts on the northern and eastern sides and part of the southern side. There are five ancient city gates, These are, clockwise from the north of the citadel:

* Assum Bari (located in the north)
* Argobba Bari (located in the east)
* Suqutat Bari (located in the south east)

Other gates such as the unofficial modern sixth &quot;Harar gate&quot; was built after the Abyssinian invasion in the 19th century.

==Houses==

Known as &quot;gey gar&quot; (&quot;city house&quot;, plural: &quot;gey garach&quot;), Harari houses form a distinct archetype that differs from other Muslim regions and from other parts of Ethiopia. The traditional Harari house design is still widely in use today, with only minor changes, and Hararis who have moved to other cities try to adhere to a similar style. Hararis take great pride in their houses, and they form an important part of Harari culture.

A walled compound (&quot;abāt&quot;) consists of several residences, which share the same walls but are not interconnected. They are arranged around a courtyard, with most of the windows facing the courtyard instead of the street. Doors to individual residences almost always point east or west; north- or south-facing doors are rare. According to Kabir Abdulmuheimen Abdulnassir, farmers and merchants often have east-facing doors so that they can rise early for work. The several families who live in the same compound share one or two kitchens, which are disconnected from the residences. The walls that surround the compounds are joined so that they are basically continuous. The outer gate facing the street is usually wooden but sometimes iron, and they are either painted or whitewashed. The walls form an architrave around them.

Sometimes several compounds are joined into a &quot;block&quot; of compounds, all surrounded by the same wall and then having their own walls around them. These &quot;blocks&quot; are set up so that a visitor passes the first compound before reaching the second, etc.

Building materials are local stone, while a mixture of pounded stones and clay are used as both mortar and plaster to cover the walls before they are whitewashed. This is the case in newer houses as well as older ones.
The floor plan of a typical Harari house is rectangular. The main room is the large living room called the &quot;gidīr gār&quot; or the &quot;gār ēqäd&quot;. The gidīr gār has several raised platforms, called &quot;nädäba&quot;s, which function as seats or beds. A typical house will have five nädäbas. At the back of the gidir gar, across from the front door, are two nädäbas: the &quot;small&quot; one, or &quot;tīt nädäba&quot;, and then behind it the &quot;big&quot; one, or &quot;gidīr nädäba&quot;, which is somewhat higher up. These are the two largest nädäbas. Shoes may be worn as far as the tīt nädäba, but then they must be removed. The tīt nädäba is where younger people or people with less seniority sit. Children also sleep on this nädäba. Historically, at the emir&#x27;s court, it served as the seat for plaintiffs or defendants. The gidīr nädäba seats elders and people who are considered more senior. Historically, at the emir&#x27;s court, dignitaries were seated here. When a person dies, their body is kept on the gidīr nädäba before being buried as a sign of respect. A basin is dug in the gidīr nädäba and filled with water and used to wash the body, and then the basin is filled in again.

The &quot;amīr nädäba&quot;, or nädäba of honor, is reserved for the master of the house and for honored guests; it can be on either the left or the right depending on the house. It is positioned so that the head of the family can see whoever enters the home and act accordingly. The &quot;hidden&quot; nädäba, or the &quot;sutri nädäba&quot;, can also be on either side but is always behind a protruding pillar or &quot;maxazu&quot;. Historically, this is known as the &quot;malassay nädäba&quot; because the guards of the emir would sit here during meetings or court cases. The sutri nädäba is used for sleeping. It is also used as a seat where the husband rests when he comes home. Finally, there is the &quot;gäbti äḥer näbäda&quot;, or the one behind the entrance door. Like the amīr and sutri nädäbas, this one can be on either the left or the right. At the back corners there are sometimes built-in cupboards or wardrobes called &quot;näbäda dēra&quot;s. Cash and important documents are kept in a chest in the näbäda dēra. The upper part of the näbäda dēra is used to store clothes belonging to the master of the house.
The gidīr gār has built-in niches called &quot;ṭāqēt&quot;s which are used to store and display personal possessions. They are fairly high up and there are typically 11 of them: five on the main wall opposite the door, and the rest on the other walls. The two rectangular niches in the middle of the main wall (called &quot;ēqäd ṭāqēt&quot;) are typically used to store books, especially the Qur&#x27;an. Their rectangular shape is supposed to be evocative of death and the grave. In addition to the 11 main niches, there are sometimes also niches in the nädäbas, which are used to hold shoes or an incense burner.
On either side of the entrance there is an open doorway leading to the &quot;kirtät&quot;, which is a side room with a low ceiling and its own nädäba. The wall between the kirtät and the gidīr gār sometimes has a window screen with decorative woodcarving. Women usually stay in the kirtät when men have a bärça (a meeting to chew khat and meditate). In the past, the kirtät was also where a young bride would live in seclusion for 8 months after her wedding. In that case the entryway to the kirtät, which does not otherwise have a door, would be covered with a bamboo screen and a curtain.

A second side room with a low ceiling, the &quot;dēra&quot;, is connected to the kirtät by a small door. It is used to store items which are not susceptible to attack by rats. Next to the door, the wall of the dēra has a special niche where the &quot;aflāla&quot;s are kept. These are black pottery containers with long necks and covered by elongated basketry lids called &quot;aflāla uffa&quot;s. They are used to store the family&#x27;s jewelry and other valuables, as well as the umbilical cords of the family&#x27;s children. According to Fethia Ahmed, curator of the Harari cultural museum, the lids being turned upside down indicates that the husband has died and that there is a widow living in the house.

The dēra is a private space, where a husband and wife may speak without their children listening. It is also used by children between the ages of 3 and 7 to eat during Ramadan out of public view, before they begin to fast all day long at age 7. The dēra is built with porous stone without cement to allow for better ventilation.

The ceiling above the gidīr gār rises to the full height of the house. Above the side rooms, though, there is an upper level called the &quot;qala&quot;. Originally, the qala was used mainly for storage and sometimes as a sleeping area, and it was not separated from the gidīr gār in any way. Since the late 19th century, though, there is usually a wooden screen separating the two, and the qala has basically become a distinct second floor, often with several rooms, although without nädäbas or other installations. The staircase to the qala usually consists of six to nine steps. In newer houses it has a carved wood banister but in older houses it did not.

House ceilings are traditionally made of thin tree trunks which have had their bark stripped off. Today the ceiling is whitewashed along with the rest of the house. One beam, located above the edge of the tīt nädäba, is called the &quot;ḥāmil&quot;; today it is used to hang a neon lamp from, but in the past people would hang an ostrich egg from it because it was believed that doing so would protect the house from lightning. Nowadays, the ceilings are made of varnished wooden planks, with the &quot;ḥāmil&quot; distinguished by its larger size and distinct shape.

Floors are traditionally made of red earth (called &quot;qēḥ afär&quot;), and the parts of nädäbas that aren&#x27;t covered by rugs or mats are also painted red. Today they are often tiled, usually with at least some red present. The red is supposed to be reminiscent of the blood shed at the Battle of Chelenqo.

Some houses will have an adjoining &quot;tīt gār&quot; or &quot;small house&quot;, which has a separate entrance and a nädäba of its own. The tīt gār is often unconnected to the main house. It is used by younger family members, or sometimes rented to tenants. Since the 20th century, some houses add another level above the tīt gār and connect it to the qala as well as giving it a separate entrance via a staircase on the outside of the house.

Each compound typically contained a separate room for a farmhand or servant, without nädäbas or side rooms. There would also be stables for cows and donkeys. There are also typically one or two &quot;kitchen houses&quot;, unconnected to the houses, typically located on either sides of the courtyard. These kitchens have no windows, with smoke escaping through the door, so eventually the walls end up covered in soot. Shelves made from tree trunks are used to store kitchen utensils.

In the past, Harari houses would have little to no furniture. Since the 20th century, simple Western-style wooden chairs have proliferated, as well as metal bedsteads with kapok mattresses which are set up on the sutri nädäba.

Richard Francis Burton described the emir&#x27;s home as the only building whose exterior was whitewashed, implying that most buildings were undecorated at the time of his visit in the 1800s. Most houses were similarly described as neither painted nor whitewashed as late as 1935. Today, though, Hararis typically whitewash their houses with a limestone mixture (called &quot;näçih afär&quot;) at least once and ideally twice a year, once before Ramadan and once again before the Aräfa festival. Household items and baskets are thoroughly cleaned at the same time. Today, instead of whitewashing, walls are sometimes painted using oil paints. This can be any color, although green is the most popular.
Interior decorating of homes is typically done by women. They cover the nädäbas with rugs, mats, and pillows, and decorate the walls with Harari basketry (which is also typically made by women). Enamel plates and bowls are also hung on the walls today. Decorative baskets are generally hung up symmetrically and in pairs. Each household has its own style of decoration, and women guests often comment on how they like how the host&#x27;s house is decorated. There is a stereotype that younger women are more fastidious at decorating their homes than older women, and that younger couples reapply the red earth to the floors once a week while older ones only do it a few times a year.

The largest type of decorative baskets are the kind that are used to serve bread and sweets at women&#x27;s gatherings. These have tall conical lids that are hung above and overlapping them. They are hung in one or two rows on the wall behind the gidīr nädäba and below the niches, and they are typically in alternating pairs. Between the &quot;ēqäd ṭāqēt&quot;s, the two rectangular niches in the center used for storing books, there is a vertical line of small basketry plates called &quot;sāgāri&quot;s along with their lids. These are used to serve coffee beans at wedding or funeral feasts. They are typically in a group of 3, with 2 of them sharing a pattern and design. Next to the amīr nädäba and the dēra, the wall is decorated with other basketry plates in pairs. These are about the size of a breakfast plate and traditionally are used to serve bread. Two of them are called &quot;the baskets for the mother-in-law&quot;, or the &quot;ḥamāt mot&quot;, and these are presented by the family of a bride to the in-laws at a wedding.

Emigrants from Harar often try to stick to the traditional Harari home layout when possible, even in buildings with different architectural styles. There will be some sort of gidīr gār indicated, with rugs and pillows forming an informal nädäba, and the walls will be decorated with traditional Harari basketry.

==Attractions==
Besides the stone wall surrounding the city, the old town is home to 110 mosques and many more shrines, centered on Ferez Magala square. Notable buildings include Medhane Alem Cathedral, the house of Arthur Rimbaud, the 16th-century Jami Mosque and historic Great Five Gates of Harar. Harrar Bira Stadium is the home stadium for the Harrar Beer Bottling FC. One can also visit the market.

A long-standing tradition of feeding meat to spotted hyenas also evolved during the 1960s into an impressive night show for tourists. (See spotted hyenas in Harar.)

Other places of interest include the highest amba overlooking the city, the Kondudo or &quot;W&quot; mountain, which hosts an ancient population of feral horses. A 2008 scientific mission has unleashed efforts for their conservation, as the animals are greatly endangered.

The Harar Brewery was established in 1984. Its beers can be sampled at the brewery social club adjacent to the brewery in Harar.

Intercity bus service is provided by the Selam Bus Line Share Company.

===Authenticity===
Harar Jugol is a rare example of a relatively well preserved historic town that has retained its traditions, urban fabric, and rich Harari Muslim cultural heritage to the present time. It is one of the holy towns of Islam in Africa, and the capital of a minority region within Christian Ethiopia. The historic city is physically limited and well defined by its 16th-century surrounding wall and the setting has been retained along the eastern and south-eastern sides of the property. However, inappropriate interventions, such as plastering the houses, changing doors from wood to metal, the introduction of non-traditional materials and visual impacts such as TV antennas have been gradually affecting the authenticity of the historic fabric.

<text>The Kawanishi H8K is a flying boat used by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service during World War II for maritime patrol duties. The Allied reporting name for the type was &quot;Emily&quot;.

The Kawanishi H8K was a large, four-engine aircraft designed for long range and extended endurance on patrols or bombing missions typically flown alone over the ocean. The prototype first flew in January 1941, and H8K1s made their first combat sortie in March 1942. The robust H8K2 &quot;Emily&quot; flying boat was also fitted with powerful defensive armament, for which Allied pilots had substantial respect wherever this aircraft was encountered in the Pacific theater. Aircraft historian René Francillon called the H8K &quot;the most outstanding water-based combat aircraft of the Second World War.&quot;

==Design and development==
At the same time the type&#x27;s predecessor, the Kawanishi H6K, was entering service in 1938 the Navy ordered the development of a larger, longer-ranged patrol aircraft under the designation Navy Experimental 13-&quot;Shi&quot; Large-size Flying Boat. The result was a large, shoulder-winged design that is widely regarded as the best flying boat of the war. Despite this, initial development was troublesome, with the prototype displaying terrible handling on the water. Deepening of the hull, redesigning of the planing bottom and the addition of spray strips under the nose rectified the water handling problems. Two further prototypes — actually pre-production aircraft — joined the development program in December 1941.

The IJNAS accepted the first production version as the H8K1, Navy Type 2 Flying Boat, Model 11, of which 14 would be built.

The improved H8K2 variant soon appeared, and its extremely heavy defensive armament earned it deep respect among Allied aircrews. The H8K2 was an upgrade over the H8K1 with more powerful engines, slightly revised armament, and an increase in fuel capacity. This was to be the definitive variant, with 112 produced.

36 examples of a dedicated transport version, the H8K2-L, were also built, capable of carrying 62 troops. This aircraft was also known as &quot;Seikū&quot; (晴空, &quot;Clear Sky&quot;). The side defensive blisters, ventral defensive hatch, and dorsal turret were discarded. To increase the available space within the aircraft its hull tanks were removed, thus reducing its range.

==Operational history==
The H8K entered production in 1941 and first saw operational use on the night of 4 March 1942 in a second raid on Pearl Harbor. Since the target lay out of range for the flying boats, this audacious plan involved a refuelling by submarine at French Frigate Shoals, some north-west of Hawaii, &quot;en route&quot;. Two planes from the Yokohama Kōkūtai (Naval Air Corps) attempted to bomb Pearl Harbor but, due to poor visibility, did not accomplish any significant damage. Six days after the second Pearl Harbor raid, one of the &quot;Emilys&quot; was sent on a daylight photo-reconnaissance mission of Midway Atoll. It was intercepted by radar-directed Brewster F2A Buffalo fighters of Marine Fighting Squadron 221 (VMF-221) and shot down. All aboard were killed, including Lt. Hashizume Hisao, the lead pilot of the second Pearl Harbor raid.

H8K2s were used on a wide range of patrol, reconnaissance, bombing, and transport missions throughout the Pacific War.

==Surviving aircraft==

Four aircraft survived until the end of the war. One of these, an H8K2 (work number 426), was captured by U.S. forces at the end of the war and was evaluated before being eventually returned to Japan in 1979. It was on display at Tokyo&#x27;s Museum of Maritime Science until 2004, when it was moved to Kanoya Air Base Museum at Kanoya Air Field in Kagoshima.

The submerged remains of an H8K can be found off the west coast of Saipan, where it is a popular scuba diving attraction known erroneously as the &quot;B-29&quot;, or the &quot;Emily&quot;. Another wrecked H8K lies in Chuuk Lagoon, Chuuk, in Micronesia. This aircraft is located off the south-western end of Dublon Island.

<doc id="521734" wikidata="Q5759433" url="?curid=521734" title="Highlands and Islands Alliance">
<text>The Highlands and Islands Alliance or Càirdeas was a minor Scottish electoral alliance that was active in the late 1990s. Founded in the autumn of 1998 by non-partisan politicians local to the Highlands and Islands, it only contested the inaugural Scottish Parliament election of 1999, where it collected a negligible 1.3% of the regional vote and despite a reasonably publicised campaign, failed to elect any of its candidates. Led by anti-nuclear activist Lorraine Mann, the Alliance was established to better represent marginalised communities in rural Scotland, who they felt had been ignored by government in favour of those in the more densely populated Central Belt. Its policies were near exclusively centred on localism and rural issues, only contesting Scotland&#x27;s regional additional member system so that electors could vote on nationwide matters through their constituency ballot. After the election, the group remained politically inactive until it was quietly disestablished in August 2004.

Although electorally unimportant, the Alliance&#x27;s legal campaign to allow political job sharing in the Scottish Parliament attracted considerable media and academic coverage. The dispute has since become the subject of legislative research by both the Northern Ireland Assembly and the British House of Commons, where it informed debate surrounding the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002.

==History==
===Formation and development===

Overseen by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair&#x27;s administration, a Scottish Parliament was to be established in accordance with the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum result. In response, the Highlands and Islands Alliance was founded in the autumn of 1998 by local activists who sought to &quot;create a strong, independent voice for the Highlands and Islands&quot; in preparation for the following year&#x27;s inaugural election. They believed that the Central Belt in the Scottish Lowlands, the most densely populated area in the country, had received a disproportionate amount of attention from the British Government in Westminster and that rural communities were being neglected as a consequence. The group also wanted to redress the fact, that in their opinion, residents in the Highlands and Islands experienced &quot;the lowest incomes and highest taxes in the UK&quot;. Alliance members believed that the establishment of a devolved parliament at Holyrood was an opportunity to enhance their region&#x27;s representation, commenting &quot;[we] have great hopes that Holyrood will not emerge Russian-doll like from Westminster&quot;.

Members instrumental in the Alliance&#x27;s development included playwright Edwin &#x27;Eddie&#x27; Stiven, Black Isle Councillor Bryan Beattie and the group&#x27;s sole leader, anti-nuclear activist Lorraine Mann. Prior to leading the party, Mann campaigned successfully and single-handedly against nuclear reprocessing at the Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment in Caithness, further serving as Convenor of Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping. The Alliance was formerly registered with the Electoral Commission on 25 February 1999, with Beattie acting as nominating officer, as well as treasurer, and Mann as leader. Consisting of about 280 members, the group were headquartered at Midoxgate House, a converted pigsty in the small hamlet of Fearn. Before its official registration, the party steadily built up a respectable profile; this included interviews with &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 22 and 26 January, in which they declared their intention to stand in the Scottish Parliament election, as well as criticised the disconnection between Highland parliamentarians and the constituencies they represented.

===Parliamentary campaign===
The Alliance ran an active parliamentary campaign, sometimes labelling themselves as Càirdeas, a Scottish Gaelic word that &quot;has a meaning incorporating friendship, fellowship, relationship, goodwill and alliance.&quot; Their efforts were an object of media attention, becoming the subject of several articles by BBC News, &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot; and other publications. Leader Lorraine Mann also attended a land reform debate at Aberdeen University on 16 April, where she was joined by Iain Haughie of the Scottish Conservatives, Dot Jessiman of the Scottish National Party (SNP), Charles Kennedy of the Scottish Liberal Democrats and Lord Sewel of the Scottish Labour Party. Despite reasonable coverage in public life, the party produced a &quot;disappointing&quot; result at the election, held on 6 May 1999. They captured 2,607 votes, 1.3% of those cast in the Parliament&#x27;s additional member Highlands and Islands electoral region; the group did not contest the region&#x27;s individual first-past-the-post constituencies, leaving potential supporters to vote on nationwide issues as they saw fit.

At one time, commentators observed that the Alliance was &quot;on the verge of taking one seat&quot;, with the &quot;outside chance of winning one or two seats&quot;, though all of the group&#x27;s candidates were ultimately defeated. Among them was Arthur Cormack, an Alliance candidate otherwise known as a traditional Scottish singer. Following the election, the group remained electorally inactive until it was, without statement, voluntarily deregistered from the Electoral Commission on 24 August 2004.

==Ideology and policies==
Ideologically, journalist James Cusick of &quot;The Independent&quot; observed that the Alliance had a &quot;radical edge that harks back to the Highland Land League of a century ago.&quot; Although technically non-partisan, it received the formal endorsement of post-communist group Democratic Left Scotland, which &quot;was committed to ... renew radical socialist politics&quot; through the fledgling Scottish Parliament&#x27;s proportional representation (PR) electoral system.

===Policy outline===

Mann suggested that the group were promoting &quot;positions rather than policies&quot;, with representatives not bound to act on legislation according to party instruction. They instead proposed that any Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) elected from the Alliance would consult their electorate on how to vote through the internet, namely via E-Mail, in what they hailed as a new form of &quot;community democracy&quot;. Described by political scientists David Butler and Martin Westlake as &quot;localised&quot;, the Alliance nonetheless developed a detailed regional policy platform &quot;on the basis that the distinctive voice of [the Highlands and Islands] should be heard&quot;. This included the release of a publication, &quot;The Problems, in Fishing, Aquaculture, and the Marine Environment&quot;, authored by Edwin Stiven and printed in Glenelg. In it, Stiven recommends that fisheries in the west of Scotland should be free of all European Union (EU) influence and legal restrictions, advocating their complete return to community ownership; he further suggests management by sea trusts, similar to those established for crofts. Otherwise regarding the EU, the Alliance called for more funding to be directed towards &quot;communities which have found themselves on the periphery of investment.&quot;

Domestically, the group pushed for the diversification of funding from central government to promote sustainable jobs, including the establishment of a separate, Scottish agricultural policy that prioritised land reform and redistribution initiatives. It further believed that attempted funding strategies in the Highlands and Islands were largely unworkable due to the lack of big business and investment, instead suggesting the formation of a regional Highland bank. Social policy proposals were similarly community-focused, and included support for affordable basic services and the upkeep of rural schools, namely preschools. Connected to this was the Alliance&#x27;s proposal for a non-legislative assembly in which all of the region&#x27;s parliamentarians (MPs, MEPs and MSPs) would convene and discuss policy development with their local constituents. The group also endorsed the founding of a watchdog to monitor the Highlands and Islands&#x27; quangos and public services.

Suggestions in transport included ending toll collections on the Skye Road Bridge, improving the region&#x27;s ferry network, slashing fares for local public transport and establishing a community-owned airline; these measures were to be encompassed into the Alliance&#x27;s &quot;Right to Move&quot; scheme. Nationally, the Alliance supported both the reduction of student tuition fees and the maintenance of British student grants. Regarding the continuation of the United Kingdom, it took a neutral stance, simply stating &quot;a Scotland which is treated fairly is more likely to want to stay within the union.&quot; The Alliance are recorded as supporters of the Scottish Gaelic language.

===Job-sharing platform===

The Alliance are perhaps best known for their controversial job-share candidacies. Such a proposal was suggested so that if the group were successful in obtaining a seat, the time a Holyrood representative would spend away from their rural constituents would not exceed a week, as they could interchange with their job-sharing partner. Fielding 20 candidates, the Alliance was the first British political party ever to achieve an absolute gender balance through its election nominations. Although each Alliance seat would be represented by two MSPs, the group insisted that they would share a single salary and expenses record.

Job-share proposals were eventually accepted by the Highland Council&#x27;s Returning Officer, Arthur McCourt, in April 1999. This followed a four-month dispute between the Alliance and the Highland Council, under the authority of the Scottish Office, over the arrangement. However, it was revealed that McCourt was unaware of the job-share element, and subsequently deemed the nominations invalid. Lorraine Mann successfully took the case to an employment tribunal and the group fought the election on a job-sharing platform; that said, political scientist David Boothroyd speculates that the previously illegal status of their innovation lost them popularity. Legal support for job-sharing candidates was reversed at the Employment Appeal Tribunal in December 2000 as it was ruled the tribunal system had no jurisdiction over electoral law.

Under the advice of pressure group New Ways To Work, Mann then took the disagreement to another tribunal as a sex-discrimination suit under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 in November 2001, where the council&#x27;s decision was nonetheless upheld. The case has since been referenced by the parliamentary research papers of both the Northern Ireland Assembly and the British House of Commons, where it informed debate surrounding the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002.

<text>The first Highland Land League () emerged as a distinct political force in Scotland during the 1880s, with its power base in the country&#x27;s Highlands and Islands. It was known also as the Highland Land Law Reform Association and the Crofters&#x27; Party. It was consciously modelled on the Irish Land League.

The Highland Land League was successful in getting Members of Parliament (MPs) elected in 1885 (in the 1885 general election). As a parliamentary force, it was dissipated by the Crofters&#x27; Act of 1886 and by the way the Liberal Party was seen to adopt Land League objectives. Similarly to its Irish predecessor, the Land League also used direct action tactics to resist both rackrenting and mass evictions by the Anglo-Scottish landlords of the Highlands and the use of the same tactics was to continue into 20th century. The Land League&#x27;s tactics included rent strikes, boycotting, and land occupations by crofters, cottars and squatters. Perhaps the Land League&#x27;s best known Gaelic slogan was &quot;Is treasa tuath na tighearna&quot;, (lit. &quot;The people are mightier than a lord.&quot; fig. &quot;The whole Clan is mightier than the Chief.&quot;)

==Background==
By the 1880s the common people or peasantry of the Highlands and Islands had been cleared from large areas of their ancestral lands, the clearances (known as the Highland Clearances) having occurred during the decades following the Battle of Culloden in 1746. Some emigrated at that time, but most were forced, to Canada, the US, as well as Australia and other British colonies. Many who did not leave were crammed into crofting (pieces of land surrounded by legislation) townships on very small areas of land where they were openly abused and exploited by their landlords. Many lacked even crofts of their own and became cottars and squatters on the crofts of other people. Landlords turned most of the land over to use as sheep farms and hunting parks called deer forests. In addition, in the 1880s, the Highlands and Islands were recently ravaged by the potato famine of the mid 19th century. The 1880s were also a time, however, of growing democracy and of government which was increasingly responsive to public opinion, particularly after the electoral reform Act of 1884. As many crofters in the Scottish Highlands newly qualified as £10 occupiers, the Act empowered Scottish Gaels to form the Crofters&#x27; Party and Highland Land League.

In the early 1880s, in terms of gaining sympathetic public opinion, crofters were protesting very effectively, with rent strikes and land raids, about their lack of secure tenure of land and their severely reduced access to land. The government responded in 1883 with a commission of enquiry headed by Francis Napier, and the Napier Commission published recommendations in 1884. Napier&#x27;s report fell a long way short of addressing crofters&#x27; demands and it stimulated a new wave of protests.

==The Crofters&#x27; Party==
The earlier protests had been largely confined to Skye. In 1884 protest action was much more widespread, many thousands of crofters became members of the Highland Land League and among the list of MPs elected in the 1885 United Kingdom general election there were Crofters&#x27; Party MPs elected by the constituencies of Argyllshire (Donald Horne Macfarlane), Inverness-shire (Charles Fraser-Mackintosh), Ross and Cromarty (Roderick Macdonald) and Caithness (Gavin Brown Clark). At Wick Burghs John Macdonald Cameron was also allied with the Crofters Party. A year later Parliament created the Crofters Act.

==The Crofters&#x27; Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886==

The Crofters&#x27; Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886 (49 &amp; 50 Vict. c. 29) applied to croft tenure in an area which is now recognisable as a definition of the &quot;Highlands and Islands&quot;: that of the ancient counties of Argyll, Inverness-shire, Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland, Caithness, Orkney and Shetland. (The name is used now as a name for an electoral area of the Scottish Parliament: please see Highlands and Islands). The Act granted security of tenure of existing crofts and established the first Crofters Commission (The same name was given to a different body in 1955). The Crofters Commission had rent-fixing powers. Rents were generally reduced and 50% or more of outstanding arrears were cancelled. The Act failed however to address the issue of severely limited access to land, and crofters renewed their protest actions. At the same time there was a shift in the political climate: William Gladstone&#x27;s Liberal government fell from power; the new Conservative government was much less sympathetic to the plight of crofters and much more willing to use troops to quell protests. The Liberal Party appeared to adopt and champion Land League objectives and, as a distinct parliamentary force, the Land League fragmented during the 1890s. On the issue of access to land, therefore, little real progress was to be made until after the First World War.

Some resources were put into development of the communications infrastructure of the Highlands and Islands (roads, railways, and harbours) and, in the early years of the 20th century the Congested Districts Board was able to push through the establishment of new crofting townships on Skye and in the Strathnaver area of Sutherland. The Congested Districts Board was created in 1897 and can be seen as a precursor to the Highlands and Islands Development Board, which is known now as Highland and Islands Enterprise (HIE).

A new Liberal government, elected in 1906 (in the 1906 general election), abolished the Congested Districts Board and created the Board of Agriculture for Scotland. The new board&#x27;s principal task was supposed to be that of pressing forward with land reform in the Highlands and Islands. It was largely ineffective. By 1913 crofters were again staging land raids.

==Second League in 1909==
Meanwhile, in Glasgow, in 1909, a second Highland Land League was formed as a political party. This organisation was a broadly left-wing group that sought the &quot;restoration of deer forests to public ownership&quot;, &quot;abolition of plural farms&quot; and the &quot;nationalisation of the land&quot;. Also they resolved to &quot;resolutely defend crofters facing eviction by their landlords&quot; and they &quot;supported home rule for Scotland&quot;.

During the First World War (1914 to 1918) politicians made lavish promises about reform which would follow the war, and of course many crofters died in the war itself. After the war the words of politicians did not translate into immediate action, but crofters returning from the war were in no mood to accept government inaction. Land raids began again. To set this Scottish Highland political radicalism in context, the 1916 Easter Rising was recent history in Ireland, as were the Liberal February Revolution and the Communist October Revolution in Russia, not to mention the socialist Kiel mutiny, which helped end the First World War and bring about the German Revolution. With these other events in mind, the Highland Land League, although radical, were positively gentle in their politics compared to radicals in other countries around the same time.

In August 1918 the new Land League had affiliated with the Labour Party, with four candidates for the 1918 general election being joint League-Labour. By the 1920s they had fully merged with Labour, under the promise of autonomy for Scotland were Labour to gain power in the forthcoming years, which however remained unfulfilled, presumably at least partly because although Labour succeeded in forming a government, they failed to gain a majority in the House of Commons.

==Subsequent history==
Land League members were then key to the formation of the Scottish National Party in 1934. When faced with new land raids the government responded by giving the Board of Agriculture the money and powers to do something like what had been promised. The Board&#x27;s work was assisted by a downturn in the profitability of sheep farming and, by the late 1920s, perhaps of arable land and of hill pasture had been given over to establishing new crofts. Most of the new crofts were in the Hebrides, the area where Gaelic best survives into the present day. Crofters benefited also in parts of Caithness, Sutherland, Shetland, and various other localities.

Crofting is still a distinct lifestyle today, and the Scottish Crofting Federation continues to represent crofters.

<text>B channel (bearer) is a telecommunications term which refers to the ISDN channel in which the primary data or voice communication is carried. It has a bit rate of in full duplex.

The term is applied primarily in relation to the ISDN access interfaces (PRA or PRI and BRA or BRI), since deeper in the PSTN network an ISDN bearer channel is essentially indistinguishable from any other bearer channel.

Apart from any transmission errors, the purpose of the network is to carry the contents of the B channel transparently between the endpoints of the call. Exceptions to this general principle include:

*If one or more trunks on the route between the endpoints employ robbed-bit signaling, this will result in frequent bit errors in the least-significant bit of bytes transported by the channel, effectively limiting the channel to .
*If the call has been established as a long-distance voice call, then echo cancellers may be being employed. While these improve the quality of the channel when it is used for voice communications, they render the channel essentially useless for data communications purposes (whether modulated or not).
*International voice calls may include A-law to μ-law conversion, which also impairs the channel when used for data communications purposes.
*Long-distance voice calls may also employ some form of voice compression, typically provided by equipment such as DCME.

In order to assure the usability of the channel for data communications, the following measures are at the disposal of users:
*ISDN terminal equipment can specify the required Bearer Capability when establishing the call.
*If the call is being set up as a voice call between modems, then a 2100 Hz answer tone sent in the backward direction during the initial seconds of the conversation phase of the call will result in any echo cancellers or echo suppressors being disabled for the remainder of the call.

<doc id="521753" wikidata="Q748962" url="?curid=521753" title="Flashover">
<text>A flashover is the near-simultaneous ignition of most of the directly exposed combustible material in an enclosed area. When certain organic materials are heated, they undergo thermal decomposition and release flammable gases. Flashover occurs when the majority of the exposed surfaces in a space are heated to their autoignition temperature and emit flammable gases (see also flash point). Flashover normally occurs at or for ordinary combustibles and an incident heat flux at floor level of .

An example of flashover is the ignition of a piece of furniture in a domestic room. The fire involving the initial piece of furniture can produce a layer of hot smoke, which spreads across the ceiling in the room. The hot buoyant smoke layer grows in depth, as it is bounded by the walls of the room. The radiated heat from this layer heats the surfaces of the directly exposed combustible materials in the room, causing them to give off flammable gases, via pyrolysis. When the temperatures of the evolved gases become high enough, these gases will ignite throughout their extent.

==Types==
* A &quot;lean flashover&quot; (sometimes called &quot;rollover&quot;) is the ignition of the gas layer under the ceiling, leading to total involvement of the compartment. The air–fuel ratio is at the bottom region of the flammability range (i.e. lean).
* A &quot;rich flashover&quot; occurs when the flammable gases are ignited while at the upper region of the flammability range (i.e. rich). This can happen in rooms where the fire subsided because of lack of oxygen. The ignition source can be a smouldering object, or the stirring up of embers by the air track. Such an event is known as &quot;backdraft&quot;.
* A &quot;delayed flashover&quot; occurs when the colder gray smoke cloud ignites after congregating outside of its room of origin. This results in a volatile situation, and if the ignition occurs at the ideal mixture, the result can be a violent &quot;smoke gas explosion&quot;. This is referred to as &quot;smoke explosion&quot; or &quot;fire gas ignition&quot; depending on the severity of the combustion process.
* A &quot;hot rich flashover&quot; occurs when the hot smoke with flammable gas ratio above the upper limit of flammability range and temperature higher than the ignition temperature leaves the compartment. Upon dilution with air it can spontaneously ignite, and the resultant flame can propagate back into the compartment, resulting in an event similar to a rich flashover. The common definition of this process is known as &quot;auto-ignition&quot;, which is another form of fire gas ignition.

==Dangers==
Flashover is one of the most feared phenomena among firefighters. Firefighters are taught to recognize the signs of imminent rollovers and flashovers and to avoid backdrafts. For example, there are certain routines for opening closed doors to buildings and compartments on fire, known as door entry procedures, ensuring fire crew safety where possible.

==Indicators==
The following are some of the signs that firefighters are looking for when they attempt to determine whether a flashover is likely to occur.

* Fast dark smoke.
* The neutral plane is moving down towards the floor. In this situation, a flashover is plausible.
* All directly exposed combustible materials are showing signs of pyrolysis.
* &quot;Rollover&quot; or tongues of fire appear (known as &quot;angel fingers&quot; to firefighters) as gases reach their auto-ignition temperatures.
* There is a rapid build-up (or &quot;spike&quot;) in temperature due to the compound effect of rapidly burning (i.e., deflagrating) gases and the thermal cycle they produce. This is generally the best indication of a flashover.
* The fire is in a ventilated compartment, so there is no shortage of oxygen in the room.

Firefighters memorize a chant to help remember these during training: &quot;Thick dark smoke, high heat, rollover, free burning.&quot;

The colour of the smoke is often considered as well, but there is no connection between the colour of the smoke and the risk of flashovers. Traditionally, black, dense smoke was considered particularly dangerous, but history shows this to be an unreliable indicator. For example, there was a fire in a rubber mattress factory in London in 1975 which produced white smoke. The white smoke was not considered dangerous, so firefighters decided to ventilate, which caused a smoke explosion and killed two firefighters. The white smoke from the pyrolysis of the rubber turned out to be extremely flammable.

<text>In telecommunications, Bearer Service or data service is a service that allows transmission of information signals between network interfaces. These services give the subscriber the capacity required to transmit appropriate signals between certain access points, i.e. user network interfaces.

Bearer Services are categorized by three classes of attributes: dominant, secondary, and qualifying. These classes are categorized by accessing services, interworking requirements, and other general characteristics.

The bearer services contain the following:
#Rate adapted sub-rate information like circuit switched asynchronous and synchronous duplex data, 3009600 bits.
#Speech and data swapping during a call, i.e. alternate speech and data.
#Modem selection, i.e. selection of 3.1 kHz audio service when inter-working with ISDN.

<text>Hyas (, ; ), in Greek mythology, was a Boeotian who was regarded as the ancestor of the ancient Hyantes (Ὕαντες), who were the aboriginal inhabitants of Boeotia. His name means rain from &quot;hyô, hyetos.&quot;

== Family ==
Hyas was the son of the Titan Atlas and either of the Oceanids, Pleione or Aethra, thus brother to the Pleiades and Hyades. In one account, Hyas instead was called the father of the Hyades by Boeotia.

== Mythology ==

=== Death ===
Hyas was a notable archer who was killed by his intended prey. Some stories have him dying after attempting to rob a lion of its cubs. &quot;While his [i.e. Hyas] beard was fresh, stags trembled in terror before him, and the hare was welcome prey. But when years matured his manhood, he breavely closed with the shaggy lioness and the boar. He sought the lair and brood of the whelped lioness and was bloody prey to the Libyan beast.&quot;Some have Hyas killed by a serpent, but most commonly he is said to have been gored by a wild boar. His sisters, the Hyades, mourned his death with so much vehemence and dedication that they died of grief. Zeus, in recognition of their familial love, took pity upon them and changed them into stars—the constellation Hyades—and placed them in the head of Taurus, where their annual rising and setting are accompanied by plentiful rain.&quot;His {i.e. Hyas]] mother [Aethra] sobbed for Hyas, his sad sisters sobbed and Atlas, whose neck would haul the world. The sisters surpassed both parents in pious love and won heaven. Their name is from Hyas.&quot;

=== Interpretation ===
The mythological use for a &quot;Hyas&quot;, apparently a back formation from Hyades, may simply have been to provide a male figure to consort with the archaic rain-nymphs, the Hyades, a chaperone responsible for their behavior, as all the archaic sisterhoods— even the Muses— needed to be controlled under the Olympian world-picture (Ruck and Staples). In fact among the poets it is immaterial whether Hyas is described as their father or their brother. And his death gave these weepy &quot;rain&quot;-nymphs a cause for their weeping, mourning for a male being an acceptably passive female role in the patriarchal culture of the Hellenes. Hyas had no separate existence except as progenitor/guardian of the Hyantes, neither in mythic narrative nor in rite, even the alternative accounts of his demise being somewhat conventional and interchangeable: compare the death of Meleager or Actaeon.

== Hyantes ==
The Hyantes, descendants of Hyas—or rather of the Hyades, for the fertility of rain-nymphs needs no male consort— were the original (&quot;Pelasgian&quot;) inhabitants of Boeotia, from which country they were expelled by the followers of Cadmus. Into late Classical times (as by Pausanias, for example), Cadmus was remembered as having been a Phoenician, or at least backed by a Phoenician army, and there may be a nugget of political reality at the heart of the myth, that a Phoenician colony established along the Boeotian coast had displaced some of the area&#x27;s aboriginal inhabitants while absorbing others.

Some of the Hyantes are said to have emigrated to isolated and pastoral Phocis, where they founded Hyampolis, or at least that gave a good etiological explanation for the city&#x27;s name. Others supposedly fled to Aetolia, another region that retained a primitive character into Classical times. The poets used the adjective &quot;Hyantius&quot; as equivalent to &quot;Boeoticus,&quot; or &quot;rural&quot;, partly as a demonstration of how conversant they were with such arcane details:

:Thus, then, Hyantius to his Partners spake,
:That trod the Mazes of the pathlesse Wood:
:My Friends our nets and javelins reake with blood:
:Enough hath been the fortune of this day: —(Ovid)

The speaker is Actaeon, grandson of Cadmus, who came to an end somewhat similar to that of Hyas.

<text>The W. E. B. Du Bois Library is one of the three libraries of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts, the others being the Science and Engineering Library and the Wadsworth Library at the Mount Ida Campus. The W. E. B. Du Bois Library holds resources primarily in humanities and social and behavioral sciences. At 28 stories and 286 feet inches (roughly 88 m) tall, it is the third-tallest library in the world after the National Library of Indonesia in Jakarta at 414 feet (126 m) and Shanghai Library in China at 348 feet (106 m). Measuring taller purely by height, the libraries in Jakarta and Shanghai both only have 24 floors. The W. E. B. Du Bois Library is also considered to be the tallest academic research library and 32nd tallest educational building in the world. The building maintains a security force, which is managed by various supervisors and student employees.

Present holdings at the UMass Libraries include over 4 million titles and over nine million individual items, providing access to over 200,000 online journals, over 1,700,000 e-books, and more than 500 databases.

As part of the Five College Consortium, the UMass Amherst Libraries also have access to material from its partners in the Consortium: Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College, and Smith College. Students can also take advantage of the Interlibrary Loan Services to obtain materials from libraries beyond the Five College system and from all over the world.

==History==
As the University of Massachusetts Amherst began to grow exponentially in the 1960s it was decided by the Board of Trustees that a large University Library would be needed for the library system to make the transition into the future. The designer was Edward Durrell Stone who followed recommendations by a Boston library consultant who recommended that the university would require a building of nearly 310,000 square feet to meet with the growing demands of students. Ground was broken in April 1969 and the building was opened to the public in 1973, with an official dedication taking place in 1974.

The building was ordered closed in September 1979 by then Chancellor Henry Koffler to address the serious issue of &quot;spalling&quot; where bits of brick from the facade on the exterior building would fall away. The most important and most used volumes were removed to the former Goodell Library Stacks (located adjacent to the building) as well as the majority of the library departments. The building was closed to all except staff who were allowed to retrieve any books left in the building. In December 1979 the building was reopened with a maximum occupancy of 500 persons, and a special ticket was required for entry. In 1983, the university acquired $2.5 million from the state legislature to begin a major renovation of the building&#x27;s brick veneer. The money would also be used to reconstruct the main lobby and resize the first few floors of the building. The building was restored to full usage in 1985 and students and staff led an initiative in 1986 called &quot;Mass Transformation&quot; to clean up and restore the interior of the building. This initiative also was responsible for establishing the campus competition to add murals to the library stairwells.

The building was originally referred to as the University Tower Library, but was renamed the W. E. B. Du Bois Library following a popular student movement in 1994. There was significant debate on whether or not it was appropriate to name the library after W. E. B. Du Bois due to his ties to the Communist Party USA. University policy also dictated that dedications were to be made for those who made significant donations to the university. While administration focused on the more practical reasons for the dedication, students were focused on his communist leanings with fighting imperialism and capitalism. There were many conflicts between administration, students, and the general public on whether or not it was appropriate to dedicate the library after Du Bois, but ultimately, the dedication gathered enough support and was celebrated over a period of several days by the entire community.

Special Collections is home to the memoirs and papers of the distinguished African-American scholar, writer, and activist, W. E. B. Du Bois, which were acquired by former Chancellor Randolph Bromery, a friend of Du Bois. The library is also the depository for other important collections relating to social issues, such as the papers of Congressman Silvio O. Conte, Horace Mann Bond, Kenneth R. Feinberg, and Daniel Ellsberg.

==General information==
The library offers several computer labs, a tutoring center, the writing center, equipment lending from the Digital Media lab, the Digital Scholarship Center (formerly the Image Collection Library) and an IT Support Desk. The upper floors contain books from various academic fields focusing primarily on the humanities and social behavioral sciences, including a sizeable East Asian Collection, Art Collections, UMass Thesis Archive, and &quot;SCUA,&quot; the Special Collections and University Archives. Some floors also house special offices and study carrels that are available to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers seeking a private study area. The library offers tutoring, writing workshops, and supplemental instruction scattered among its 26 floors.

The topmost floors of the library are a popular destination for those wishing to see a panoramic view of the campus and surrounding Pioneer Valley. The 23rd Floor is quite popular as it is the highest floor from which patrons can view the Valley from each of the building&#x27;s four sides.

The library is accessible to UMass Amherst and 5-College Students for 7 days a week during the normal academic year. The building is a public library so citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts who are 18 years of age can access the majority of the building and its materials. An application for a borrowers card can be made online or on-site.

Peregrine falcons have nested atop the building since 2003 and a camera was installed so that their nest box could be live streamed to the public.

In 2011, Room 25 located on the Lower Level, was transformed into a &quot;Team Based Learning Classroom&quot; that can hold approximately 75 students.

In time for the fall 2017 semester, a refresh of the lobby was completed included the installation of new digital signage and a new information desk, the Graduate Commons was opened on the 5th floor, and a second teaching space was finished for the Archives.

The Science and Engineering Library, which holds the bulk of the STEM related collection is located at a separate location in the Lederle Graduate Research Center Lowrise.

==Learning Commons==
A prominent feature of the W. E. B. Du Bois Library is the Learning Commons, located on the Lower Level, which opened in 2005. The Learning Commons provides a central location for resources provided by many departments across campus including Circulations/Reserves/Interlibrary Loan, the Writing Center, Reference and Research Assistance, the Assistive Technologies Center, an Information Technologies Help Desk, and the Learning Commons and Technical Support desk.

The Learning Commons has over 30,000 square feet, with 450 seats available. There are 18 group study rooms which can be reserved, so students can work together without disturbing others, and there are over 200 work stations equipped with Mac and PC computers. The computers have a broad range of software installed, and are arranged in a variety of configurations to allow both individual and collaborative work. The entire building gained wireless Internet access in 2008. The North End is also home to the micro climate area, which consists of many experimental seating arrangements and television screens for group work.

Access to the Oswald Tippo Library Courtyard is on this level, which contains the statue entitled &quot;Searching for Buddha in the Mountains,&quot; designed by Thomas Matsuda in 1999 and installed in 2000.

==Building myths==

The building has fallen victim to several myths since its opening in 1973, the most popular of these being a variation of the &quot;Sinking Library Myth,&quot; where the architect supposedly forgot to account for the weight of the books in the building&#x27;s designs, resulting in a settling of the building. This is a popular myth attributed to many university libraries and is untrue.

The spalling of the bricks has also led to the common assumption that entire bricks fall away from the building, and invariably make contact with someone on the ground. While bits of material do occasionally break away, a full brick has never come away from the building.

The unusual inclusion of carrel floors bred the belief that the building was not originally designed to be a library, but was supposed to be an office building and the plans were mixed up. The building was designed to work in units of three, with two stacks floors holding similar subjects and a carrel floor to accommodate departments and librarians related to those materials. The plan never fully came to fruition, and carrels are used by graduate students and professors as quiet study spaces. This myth gained further traction after the construction of the Standard Oil building (now Aon Center) by Durell&#x27;s firm in Chicago which features a similar design with an exterior clad in marble.

==Renovations==
Throughout the years since the building was first built, many renovations and upgrades have been completed on the library. These renovations have included a new entryway, brand new elevator systems, a sprinkler system and fire suppression, a reconfigured cafe, as well as electrical upgrades and an HVAC system. There is also a new loading dock and service entrance being built in conjunction with the renovation of the South College Building on the west side of the library.

In 2017, the Digital Scholarship Center and the Freshman Writing Program (both formerly located in Bartlett Hall) moved to the sixth and twelfth floors respectively, and renovations were completed to provide additional space to the Learning Resource Center on the thirteenth floor.

<text>Uwe Johnson (; 20 July 1934 – 22 February 1984) was a German writer, editor, and scholar. Such prominent writers and scholars as Günter Grass and Hans Mayer declared Johnson to be the most significant writer to emerge from East Germany. During the 1950s, he had troubles with the East German authorities, being treated as a &quot;dissident&quot; both for political reasons and for Modernist experiments in his works which made him opposed to the dominant doctrine of Socialist realism; after moving to West Berlin in 1959, he gained the label of &quot;the author of the two Germanies&quot;, as, while criticizing East Germany as the state which betrayed the Socialist ideals, he didn&#x27;t regard West Germany as a viable alternative and opposed the division of Germany in general. His works were dedicated both to East and West German societies and examined the relations between them.

== Life ==
Johnson was born in Kammin in Pomerania (now Kamień Pomorski, Poland). His father was a peasant of Swedish descent from Mecklenburg and his mother was from Pomerania. In 1945 the family fled to Anklam in West Pomerania and in 1946 his father died in a Soviet internment camp (Fünfeichen). The family eventually settled in Güstrow, where he attended the John Brinckman-Oberschule from 1948 to 1952. He went on to study German philology, first in Rostock (1952–1954), then in Leipzig (1954–1956). His &quot;Diplomarbeit&quot; (final thesis) was on Ernst Barlach. Due to his failure to show support for the Communist regime of East Germany, he was suspended from the university on 17 June 1953, but he was later reinstated.

Beginning in 1953, Johnson worked on his first novel, &quot;Ingrid Babendererde&quot;, which was rejected by various publishing houses and remained unpublished during his lifetime.

In 1956, Johnson&#x27;s mother left for West Berlin. As a result, he was not allowed to take a normal job in the East. Unemployed for political reasons, he translated Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Israel Potter: His Fifty Years of Exile&quot; (the translation was published in 1961) and began to write the novel &quot;Mutmassungen über Jakob&quot;, published in 1959 by Suhrkamp in Frankfurt am Main. Johnson himself moved to West Berlin at this time. He promptly became associated with Gruppe 47, which Hans Magnus Enzensberger once described as &quot;the Central Café of a literature without a capital&quot;.

During the early 1960s, Johnson continued to write and publish fiction, and also supported himself as a translator, mainly from English, and as an editor. He travelled to America in 1961. The following year he was married, had a daughter, received a scholarship to Villa Massimo, Rome, and won the Prix International.

In 1964 he wrote reviews for the &quot;Tagesspiegel&quot; of television programmes broadcast from East Germany, published later under the title &quot;Der 5. Kanal&quot; [The Fifth Channel], 1987). In the same year he also published a collection of stories, &quot;Karsch, und andere Prosa&quot; (Karsch, and Other Prose), and, two years later, &quot;Zwei Ansichten&quot; (Two Views).

In 1965, Johnson travelled again to the United States. He then edited Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Me-ti. Buch der Wendungen. Fragmente 1933–1956&quot; (&quot;Me-ti: the Book of Changes. Fragments, 1933–1956&quot;). From 1966 to 1968, he worked in New York City as a textbook editor at Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, and lived with his wife and their daughter in an apartment at 243 Riverside Drive (Manhattan). In 1967, he began work on his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;Jahrestage&quot;. and edited &quot;Das neue Fenster&quot; (The New Window), a textbook of German-language readings for English-speaking students learning German.

In February 1967, the Kommune 1 moved into Johnson&#x27;s apartment building in West Berlin. He first learned in a newspaper report about a plan for a &quot;pudding attack&quot; on the U.S. Vice-President Hubert Humphrey.

Returning to West Germany in 1969, Johnson became a member of both its PEN Center and its Akademie der Künste (Academy of the Arts). In 1970, he published the first volume of his &quot;Jahrestage&quot; (&quot;Anniversaries&quot;). Two more volumes were to follow in the next three years, but the fourth volume did not appear until 1983.

In 1972, Johnson became Vice President of the Academy of the Arts and edited Max Frisch&#x27;s &quot;Tagebuch 1966–1971&quot;.
In 1974, Johnson, his wife and their daughter moved into 26 Marine Parade, a Victorian terrace house overlooking the sea in Sheerness on the Isle of Sheppey in Southeast England. Shortly afterwards, he broke off work on &quot;Jahrestage&quot;, due partly to health problems and partly to writer&#x27;s block. However, his ten years in Sheerness were not completely unproductive. He published some shorter works and continued to do some work as an editor. In 2020, a monograph by cultural historian Patrick Wright, &quot;The Sea View Has Me Again,&quot; was published by Repeater Books, focusing on Johnson&#x27;s decade living in Sheerness&quot;.&quot;

In 1977, he was admitted to the Darmstädter Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung (Darmstadt Academy for Language and Literature). Two years later he informally withdrew.

In 1979, he gave a series of lectures on poetics at the University of Frankfurt, published posthumously as &quot;Begleitumstände. Frankfurter Vorlesungen&quot;.

In 1983, the fourth volume of &quot;Jahrestage&quot; was published, but Johnson broke off a reading tour for health reasons. He died from hypertensive heart disease in Sheerness on 22 February 1984. His body was not found until 13 March. At the time of his death, he had been planning a one-year stay in New York City.

==Marriage==
On 27 February 1962, Johnson married Elisabeth Schmidt, whom he later (1975) accused of conducting a love affair with the Czech Mozart scholar Tomislav Volek.

<doc id="521776" wikidata="Q5357753" url="?curid=521776" title="Electrical wiring in North America">
<text>Electrical wiring in North America follows the regulations and standards applicable at the installation location. It is also designed to provide proper function, and is also influenced by history and traditions of the location installation. 

The US National Electrical Code is applicable to many areas in the US where state, county or local authorities have adopted it. For electrical wiring in Canada, the Canadian Electrical Code is a very similar standard published in Canada by the Canadian Standards Association.

==Terminology==
Although much of the electrician&#x27;s field terminology matches that of the electrical codes, usages can vary:
* Neutral wire is the return conductor of a circuit; in building wiring systems, the neutral wire is connected to earth ground at only one point. North American standards state that the neutral is neither switched nor fused except in very narrowly defined circumstances. The neutral is connected to the center tap of the power company transformer of a split-phase system, or the center of the wye connection of a polyphase power system.
:United States electrical codes require that the neutral be connected to earth at the &quot;service panel&quot; only and at no other point within the building wiring system. Formally, the neutral is called the &quot;grounded conductor&quot;; as of the 2008 NEC, the terms &quot;neutral conductor&quot; and &quot;neutral point&quot; have been defined in the Code to conform to what had been common usage.
* Hot is any line or neutral conductor (wire or otherwise) connected with an electrical system that has electric potential relative to electrical ground or line to neutral.
* Ground is a safety conductor with a low impedance path to earth. It is often called the &quot;ground wire,&quot; or safety ground. It is either bare or has green insulation.
* Leg as in &quot;hot leg&quot; refers to one of multiple hot conductors in an electrical system. The most common residential and small commercial service in Canada and the U.S., single split-phase, 240 V, features a neutral and two hot legs, 240 V to each other, and 120 V each to the neutral. The most common three-phase system will have three hot legs, 208 V to each other and 120 V each to the neutral. An older, but still widely used, high-leg delta system uses three phases with 240 volts phase-to-phase for motor loads, and 120 volts for lighting loads by use of a center-tapped transformer; two of the phases are 120 volts to neutral. The third phase, the &quot;high leg&quot; of the system (also referred to as the &quot;wild leg&quot;), has 208 V to neutral and is not usually used for single-phase connections, so is distinctively colored. For larger commercial installations, 277/480 V or 347/600 V three-phase is common.
*An outlet is defined by the NEC as &quot;a point in the wiring system at which current is taken to utilization equipment&quot;. This definition includes receptacles, lighting, motors, etc. Ordinary switches control but do not consume electricity, and therefore are not defined as outlets in this sense.

==Electrical codes and standards==
===United States===
The United States National Electrical Code (NEC) specifies minimum acceptable wiring methods and materials for many states and municipalities. It is sponsored by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and has been periodically revised since 1897. Local jurisdictions usually adopt the NEC or another published code and then distribute documents describing how local codes vary from the published codes. Governments cannot distribute the NEC itself for copyright reasons, though parts that have been adopted into law are not subject to copyright.

The purpose of the NEC is to protect persons and property from hazards arising from the use of electricity. The NEC is not any jurisdiction&#x27;s electrical code per se; rather, it is an influential work of standards that local legislators (e.g., city council members, state legislators, etc. as appropriate) tend to use as a guide when enacting local electrical codes. The NFPA states that excerpts quoted from the National Electrical Code must have a disclaimer indicating that the excerpt is not the complete and authoritative position of the NFPA and that the original NEC document must be consulted as the definitive reference.

New construction, additions or major modifications must follow the relevant code for that jurisdiction, which is not necessarily the latest version of the NEC. Regulations in each jurisdiction will indicate when a change to an existing installation is so great that it must then be rebuilt to comply with the current electrical code. Generally existing installations are not required to be changed to meet new codes.

Other code requirements vary by jurisdiction in the United States. In many areas, a homeowner, for example, can perform household wiring for a building which the owner occupies; this may even be complete wiring of a home. A few cities have more restrictive rules and require electrical installations to be done by licensed electricians. The work will be inspected by a designated authority at several stages before permission is obtained to energize the wiring from the local electric utility; the inspector may be an employee of the state or city, or an employee of an electrical supply utility.

===Canada===
For electrical wiring in Canada, the Canadian Electrical Code is a very similar standard to that of the United States, published by the Canadian Standards Association since 1927.

===Mexico===
Electrical wiring standards in Mexico follow that of the United States&#x27; NEC.

== Design and installation conventions ==
For residential wiring, some basic rules given in the NEC are:

*Terminals for the neutral (grounded) conductor in general, and for receptacles, plugs, and connectors specifically, are required to be substantially white in color [NEC 200.9, NEC 200.10 (B)], and if the terminal itself is not visible, the hole leading to it must be marked with the word &quot;white&quot; or the letter &quot;W&quot;. Edison-base lamp sockets (called screw shell devices in the NEC) are required to have the neutral conductor attached to the outer screw shell [NEC 200.10(C)]. In actual practice, the neutral terminal is silver colored, the line and load terminals are brass or (rarely) painted black), and the grounding screw is usually colored green. A common mnemonic electricians use to remember which wire goes to which terminal is &quot;white to light…black to brass…green to green&quot;.
*&quot;Phase&quot; wire in a circuit may be any color other than green, gray, or white (whether these are solid colors or stripes). The common colors are black, red, blue, brown, yellow, and orange (high-leg delta) insulated wire, sometimes other colors. Specific exceptions apply, such as a cable running to a switch and back (known as a traveler) where the white wire will be the hot wire feeding that switch. Another is for a cable used to feed an outlet for 250 VAC appliances that do not need a neutral, there the white is hot. In both those instances the white wire should be identified as being hot, usually with black tape inside junction boxes.
*The &quot;neutral&quot; wire is identified by gray or white insulated wire, perhaps using stripes or markings.
*With lamp cord wire the ribbed wire is the neutral, and the smooth wire is the hot. NEC 2008 400.22(f) allows surface marking with ridged, grooves or white stripes on the surface of lamp cord. With transparent cord the hot wire is copper colored, and the neutral is silver colored.
*&quot;Grounding&quot; wire of circuit may be bare or identified insulated wire of green or green having yellow stripes. All metallic systems in a building are to be bonded to the building grounding system, such as water, natural gas, HVAC piping, and others.
*Larger wires are generally furnished only in black; these black wires may be properly re-identified with suitable paint or tape.
*All wiring in a circuit except for the leads that are part of a device or fixture must be of the required gauge or larger. Different size wires may be used in the same raceway so long as they are all insulated for the maximum voltage of any of these circuits.
* The Code gives rules for calculating circuit loading and maximum ampacity.
*Ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) protection is required on receptacles in wet locations and locations where there exists an easy path for fault current to travel to earth. This includes all receptacles intended to service kitchen counter surfaces, crawl spaces at or below grade level, basements, garages and accessory buildings, bathrooms, laundry areas, within 6 ft. of the outside edge of a sink bathtub or shower stall, as well as outdoors. There were previous exceptions for refrigerators because unattended disconnection could cause spoilage of food and for garbage disposals. Instead, for refrigerators and other semi-permanent appliances in basements and wet areas, a one-outlet non-GFCI dedicated receptacle was generally used. As of the 2020 NEC this exception no longer exists and those devices in are required to have GFCI protection where otherwise required. Two-wire outlets having no grounding conductor may be protected by a GFCI or one upstream of the receptacle and must be labelled &quot;No Equipment Ground&quot; and &quot;GFCI Protected&quot;. Most GFCI receptacles allow the connection and provide GFCI protection for down-stream connected receptacles. Receptacles protected in this manner or with a GFCI circuit breaker should be labeled &quot;GFCI protected&quot;. (Outside North America these are referred to as a &quot;Residual-current device&quot; or RCD.)
*Arc-Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI) protection is required to protect nearly all finished areas of a home with the exception of bathrooms. This device, which can be a circuit breaker or the first outlet on a circuit, is designed to detect hazardous electrical arcing in the branch circuit wiring as well as in cords and plugs. An AFCI device is designed to trip quickly when it detects potentially dangerous arcing that could start a fire, but not trip with harmless arcing as part of the normal operation of devices such as motors.
*Most circuits have the metallic components interconnected with a grounding wire connected to the third, round prong of a plug, and to metal boxes and appliance chassis.
*Furnaces, electric water heaters, heat pumps, central air conditioning units, electric dryers, electric stoves or cooktops, and built-in microwave ovens must be on dedicated circuits.
*The code provides rules for sizing electrical boxes for the number of wires and wiring devices in the box.

The foregoing is just a brief overview and must not be used as a substitute for the actual National Electrical Code.

==Comparison of US practices with other countries==

Electrical wiring practices developed in parallel in many countries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a result, national and regional variations developed and remain in effect. (see National Electrical Code, electrical wiring, electrical wiring in the United Kingdom). Some of these are retained for technical reasons, since the safety of wiring systems depends not only on the wiring code but also on the technical standards for wiring devices, materials, and equipment.

Grounding (earthing) of distribution circuits is a notable difference in practice between wiring systems of the United States and those of other regions. Since the early 1960s, wiring in new construction has required a separate grounding conductor used to bond (electrically connect) all normally non-current carrying parts of an electrical installation. Portable appliances with metal cases also have a bonding conductor in the flexible cable and plug connecting them to the distribution system. The circuit return conductor (&quot;neutral&quot;) is also connected to ground at the service entrance panel only; no other connections from neutral to ground are allowed, unlike regulations in some other parts of the world.

Lighting and power receptacle circuits in North American systems are typically radial from a distribution panel containing circuit breakers to protect each branch circuit. The smallest branch circuit rating is 15 amperes, used for general purpose receptacles and lighting. Often, 20 ampere circuits are used for general purpose receptacles and lighting. In residential construction, branch circuits for higher ratings are usually dedicated to one appliance, for example, fixed cooking appliances, electric clothes dryers, and air conditioners. Lighting and general purpose receptacles are at 120 volts AC, with larger devices fed by three wire single-phase circuits at 240 volts. 

In commercial construction, three-phase circuits are often used. Common 3 phase configurations within a building are 208v/120 wye, 120/240 center tapped delta and 480v/277v wye. Lighting is usually fed by 277 V or 120v. 

Countries such as Mexico may adopt the NFPA standard as their national electrical code, with local amendments similar to those in United States jurisdictions. The Canadian Electrical Code, while developed independently from the NFPA code, is similar in scope and intent to the US NEC, with only minor variations in technical requirement details; harmonization of the CEC and NEC codes is intended to facilitate free trade between the two countries.

== Wiring methods ==

Most circuits in the modern North American home and light commercial construction are wired with non-metallic sheathed (NM) cable designated type. This type of cable is the least expensive for a given size and is appropriate for dry indoor applications. The designation NM &quot;XX&quot;-&quot;Y&quot; indicates, respectively, the type of sheathing (in this case, non-metallic), the size of the main conductors, and the total number of circuit conductors (exclusive of the grounding conductor). For example, NM 14-2 cable contains three conductors (two plus one ground) at 14 gauge, a size typically used for circuits protected at 15 amperes. Circuits with larger currents (such as for electric furnaces, water heaters, air conditioners, or sub-mains to additional circuit panels) will have larger conductors. Not all US jurisdictions permit use of non-metallic sheathed cable. The NEC does not permit use of NM cable in large, fire-resistant, or high-rise structures.

In type NM cable, conductor insulation is color-coded for identification, typically one black, one white, and a bare grounding conductor. The National Electrical Code (NEC) specifies that the black conductor represent the &quot;hot&quot; conductor, with significant voltage to earth ground; the white conductor represent the identified or neutral conductor, near ground potential; and the bare/green conductor, the safety grounding conductor not normally used to carry circuit current. Wires may be re-colored, so these rules are commonly excepted. In 240-volt applications not requiring a neutral conductor, the white wire may be used as the second hot conductor, but must be recolored with tape or by some other method. Four-wire flexible equipment connection cords have red as the fourth color; unlike older European practices, color-coding in flexible cords is the same as for fixed wiring.

In commercial and industrial, unenclosed NM cable is often prohibited in certain areas or altogether (depending on what the building is used for and local/state building codes). Therefore, it is almost never used by commercial electrical contractors. Most wiring is put in non-flexible conduit, usually EMT because of its cost and durability. Rigid may be required for certain areas and additionally, vapor-lock fittings may be required in areas where a fire or explosion hazard is present (such as gas stations, chemical factories, grain silos, etc.) PVC can be used where wire is run underground or where concrete will be poured. A duct bank is usually made of multiple PVC conduits encased in concrete. FMC or Flex is used where EMT or other non-flexible conduit is impractical or for short runs, known as &quot;whips&quot;, to lights or other devices. For power circuits, the color-coding uses the same colors as residential construction, and adds the additional wires used for three-phase systems. Black, Red and Blue are used for hot wires and White is used as the neutral wire in a 120/208 V circuit. Brown, Orange and Yellow are used as hot wires and gray is used as the neutral wire in a 277/480 V. For grounding, regardless of the voltage, Green (or a bare wire) is used.

Several other types of wiring systems are used for building wiring in the United States; these include corrugated metal armored cable, mineral-insulated cable, other types of power cable, and various types of electrical conduit. In industrial applications cables may be laid in cable trays. Cable type TC is especially intended for use in tray systems. Special wiring rules apply to wet or corrosive locations, and to locations which present an explosion hazard. Wiring materials for use in the United States must generally be made and tested to product standards set by NEMA and Underwriters Laboratories (UL) and must bear approval marks such as those set by UL.

Approved wiring types can vary by jurisdiction. Not all wiring methods approved in the NEC are accepted in all areas of the United States.

==Wire types==

When running through conduit, such as in commercial applications, it is typical to pull individual wires rather than a preassembled cable.

Wire is manufactured in a range of conductor sizes, stranding, and materials (copper or aluminum), but the term &quot;wire type&quot; usually refers to the &quot;insulation&quot;, which determines the environments in which the wire may be used.

Wire types for North American wiring practices are defined by standards issued by Underwriters Laboratories, the Canadian Standards Association, the American Society for Testing and Materials, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, and the Insulated Cable Engineers Association.

One important property of the insulation which affects the current-carrying capacity of the wire is the maximum conductor temperature. This, in combination with the ambient temperature and ability of the environment to absorb heat, determines the amount of tolerable copper loss in the wire, and therefore its size in relation to the load current.

The most commonly used insulation type in AC electrical distribution systems throughout North America is THHN (&quot;Thermoplastic High Heat-resistant Nylon-coated&quot;). This is a specification for PVC insulation (other thermoplastics are permitted, but rarely used) with a nylon jacket for abrasion resistance. THHN is suitable for dry or damp environments and conductor temperatures up to .

A second popular type is THWN (&quot;Thermoplastic Heat and Water-resistant Nylon-coated&quot;). This is similar to the preceding, but rated for dry or wet environments and conductor temperatures up to , and is commonly used in subsurface conduits which may fill with water.

A great deal of THWN wire is actually dual-rated, and meets THHN the specification as well, so may be used in wet environments up to 75°C &quot;or&quot; dry environments up to 90°C.

An extended specification, THWN-2 permits use in wet locations &quot;and&quot; conductor temperatures up to 90°C simultaneously.

There are additional restrictions on such wire&#x27;s use not mentioned here (for example, neither THHN nor THWN may be exposed to sunlight, or directly buried in the ground); see the NEC for details.

XHHW-2 (XLPE High Heat-resistant Water-resistant&quot;) is a less commonly seen insulation type with a thermoset plastic insulation. It has the same moisture and temperature specifications as THWN-2 (the original XHHW was equivalent to THHN/THWN dual-rated insulation), but being a thermoset plastic, it is less affected by temperature, remaining firmer at high temperatures and significantly more flexible at low temperatures. This makes it popular for outdoor wiring applications. The low dielectric constant of the insulation is also beneficial when high-frequency AC is present on the wire, such as the output of variable-frequency drives.

<text>River Out of Eden: A Darwinian View of Life is a 1995 popular science book by Richard Dawkins. The book is about Darwinian evolution and summarizes the topics covered in his earlier books, &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, &quot;The Extended Phenotype&quot; and &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot;. It is part of the &quot;Science Masters&quot; series and is Dawkins&#x27;s shortest book. It is illustrated by Lalla Ward, Dawkins&#x27;s then-wife. The book&#x27;s name is derived from Genesis 2:10 relating to the Garden of Eden. The King James Version reads &quot;And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.&quot;

&quot;River Out of Eden&quot; has five chapters. The first chapter lays down the framework on which the rest of the book is built, that life is like a river of genes flowing through geological time where organisms are mere temporary bodies. The second chapter shows how human ancestry can be traced via many gene pathways to different &quot;most recent common ancestors&quot;, with special emphasis on the &quot;African Eve&quot;. The third chapter describes how gradual enhancement via natural selection is the only mechanism which can create the observed complexity of nature. The fourth chapter describes the indifference of genes towards organisms they build and discard, as they maximise their own utility functions. The last chapter summarises milestones during the evolution of life on Earth and speculates on how similar processes may work in alien planetary systems.

== Summary ==
=== The digital river ===

Dawkins begins the book by stating that all our ancestors reached adulthood and begot at least one child before they died. In a world where most organisms die before they can procreate, descendants are common but ancestors are rare. But we can all claim an unbroken chain of successful ancestors, right back to the first single-celled organism.

If the success of an organism is measured by its ability to survive and reproduce, then all living organisms can be said to have inherited &quot;good genes&quot; from successful ancestors. Each generation of organisms is a sieve against which replicated and mutated genes are tested. Good genes fall through the sieve into the next generation while bad genes are removed. This explains why organisms become better and better at whatever it takes to succeed, and is in stark contrast to Lamarckism, which would require successful organisms to refine their genes during their lifetime.

Following this gene-centered view of evolution, it can be argued that an organism is no more than a temporary body in which a set of companion genes (actually alleles) co-operate toward a common goal: to grow the organism into adulthood, before they go their separate ways in bodies of the organism&#x27;s progeny. Bodies are created and discarded, but good genes live on as replicas of themselves, a result of a high-fidelity copy process typical of digital encoding.

Through meiosis (sexual reproduction), genes share bodies with different companion genes in successive generations. Thus genes can be said to flow in a river through geological time. Even though genes are selfish, over the long run every gene needs to be compatible with all other genes in the gene pool of a population of organisms, to produce successful organisms.

A river of genes may fork, mostly due to the geographical separation between two populations of organisms. Because genes in the two branches never share the same bodies, they may drift apart until genes from the two branches become incompatible. Organisms created by these two branches form separate, non-interbreeding species, completing the process of speciation.

=== All Africa and her progenies ===

When tracing human lineage back in time, most people look at parents, grandparents, great-grandparents and so on. The same approach is often taken when tracing descendants via children and grandchildren. Dawkins shows that this approach is misguided, as the numbers of ancestors and descendants seem to grow exponentially as generations are added to the lineage tree. In just 80 generations, the number of ancestors can exceed a trillion trillion.

This simple calculation does not take into account the fact that every marriage is really a marriage between &quot;distant cousins&quot; which include second cousins, fourth cousins, sixteenth cousins and so on. The ancestry tree is not really a tree, but a graph.

Dawkins prefers to model ancestry in terms of genes flowing through a river of time. An &quot;ancestor gene&quot; flows down the river either as perfect replicas of itself or as slightly mutated &quot;descendant genes&quot;. Dawkins fails to explicitly contrast &quot;ancestor organism&quot; and &quot;descendant organisms&quot; against &quot;ancestor genes&quot; and &quot;descendant genes&quot; in this chapter. But the first half of the chapter is really about differences between these two models of lineage. While organisms have ancestry graphs and progeny graphs via sexual reproduction, a gene has a single chain of ancestors and a tree of descendants.

Given any gene in the body of an organism, we can trace a single chain of &quot;ancestor organisms&quot; back in time, following the lineage of this one gene, as stated in the coalescent theory. Because a typical organism is built from tens of thousands of genes, there are numerous ways to trace the ancestry of organisms using this mechanism. But all these inheritance pathways share one common feature. If we start with all humans alive in 1995 and trace their ancestry by one particular gene (actually a locus), we find that the farther we move back in time, the smaller the number of ancestors become. The pool of ancestors continues to shrink until we find the &quot;most recent common ancestor&quot; (MRCA) of all humans alive in 1995 &quot;via this particular gene pathway&quot;.

In theory, one can also trace human ancestry via a single chromosome, as a chromosome contains a set of genes and is passed down from parents to children via independent assortment from only one of the two parents. But genetic recombination (chromosomal crossover) mixes genes from non-sister chromatids from both parents during meiosis, thus muddling the ancestry path.

However, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is immune to sexual mixing, unlike the nuclear DNA whose chromosomes are shuffled and recombined in Mendelian inheritance. Mitochondrial DNA, therefore, can be used to trace matrilineal inheritance and to find the Mitochondrial Eve (also known as the &quot;African Eve&quot;), the most recent common ancestor of all humans via the mitochondrial DNA pathway.

=== Do good by stealth ===
The main themes of the third chapter are borrowed from Dawkins&#x27; own book, &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot;. This chapter shows how the gradual, continuous and cumulative enhancement to organisms via natural selection is the only mechanism which can explain the complexity we observe all around us in nature. Dawkins adamantly refutes the &quot;I cannot believe so and so could have evolved by natural selection&quot; argument of Creationists, calling it the &quot;Argument from Personal Incredulity&quot;.

Creationists often claim that some features of organisms (e.g. resemblance of Ophrys (orchid) to female wasp, figure-eight dances of honeybees, mimicry of stick insects, etc.) are too complicated to be a result of evolution. Some say, &quot;half of an X will not work at all.&quot; Others say, &quot;in order for X to work, it had to be perfect the first time.&quot; Dawkins concludes that these are no more than bold assertions based on ignorance:

... Do you actually know the first thing about orchids, or wasps, or the eyes with which wasps look at females and orchids? What emboldens you to assert that wasps are so hard to fool that the orchid&#x27;s resemblance would have to be perfect in all dimensions in order to work?

Dawkins goes on to illustrate his point by demonstrating how scientists have been able to fool creatures big and small using seemingly dumb triggers. For instance, stickleback fish treat a pear-shape as a sex bomb (a supernormal stimulus). Gulls&#x27; hard-wired instincts make them reach over and roll back not just their own stray eggs, but also wooden cylinders and cocoa tins. Honeybees push out their live and protesting companion from their hive, when the companion is painted with a drop of oleic acid. Furthermore, a turkey will kill anything which moves in its nest unless it cries like a baby turkey. If the turkey is deaf, it will mercilessly kill its own babies.

As part of this, Dawkins emphasises the gradual nature of evolution. For example, some creatures such as the stick insects possess the most amazing degree of camouflage, but in fact any sort of camouflage is better than none. There is a gradient from perfect camouflage to zero camouflage. A 100 percent camouflage is better than 99 percent. A 50 percent camouflage is better than 49 percent. A 1 percent camouflage is better than no camouflage. A creature with 1 percent better camouflage than its contemporaries will leave more descendants over time (an evolutionary success), and its good genes will come to dominate the gene pool.

Not only can we classify the degree of insect camouflage using a gradient, we can also study all aspects of the surrounding environment as gradients. For instance, a 1 percent camouflage may not be distinguishable from no camouflage under bright daylight. But as light fades and night sets in, there is a critical moment when the 1 percent camouflage helps an insect escape detection by its predator, while its companion with no camouflage is eaten. The same principle can be applied to the distance between prey and predator, to the angle of view, to the skill or the age of a creature, etc.

In addition to demonstrating how gradual changes can bring about features as complex as the human eye, Dawkins states that computer simulation work by Swedish scientists Dan Nilsson and Susanne Pelger (although it is not a computer simulation but simple mathematical model) shows that the eye could have evolved from scratch a thousand times in succession in any animal lineage. In Dawkins&#x27; own words, &quot;the time needed for the evolution of the eye... turned out to be too short for geologists to measure! It is a geological blink.&quot; And, &quot;it is no wonder &quot;the&quot; eye has evolved at least forty times independently around the animal kingdom.&quot;

=== God&#x27;s utility function ===

This chapter is Dawkins&#x27;s take on the &quot;meaning of life&quot; or the &quot;purpose of life&quot;.

Dawkins quotes how Charles Darwin lost his faith in religion, &quot;I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of Caterpillars.&quot; We ask &quot;why&quot; a caterpillar should suffer such cruel punishment. We ask &quot;why&quot; digger wasps couldn&#x27;t first kill caterpillars to save them from a prolonged and agonising torture. We ask &quot;why&quot; a child should die an untimely death. And we ask &quot;why&quot; we should all grow old and die.

Dawkins rephrases the word &quot;purpose&quot; in terms of what economists call a utility function, meaning &quot;that which is maximised&quot;. Engineers often investigate the intended purpose (or utility function) of a piece of equipment using reverse engineering. Dawkins uses this technique to reverse-engineer the purpose in the mind of the Divine Engineer of Nature, or the &quot;Utility Function of God&quot;.

According to Dawkins, it is a mistake to assume that an ecosystem or a species as a whole exists for a purpose. In fact, it is wrong to suppose that individual organisms lead a meaningful life either. In nature, only genes have a utility function – to perpetuate their own existence with indifference to great sufferings inflicted upon the organisms they build, exploit and discard. As hinted at in chapter one, genes are the supreme lords of the natural world. In other words, the unit of selection is the gene, not an individual, or any other higher-order group as championed by proponents of group selection.

As long as an organism survives its childhood and manages to reproduce thus passing its genes down to the next generation, what happens to the parent organism afterwards does not really bother genes. Because an organism is always at the danger of dying from accidents (a waste of investment), it pays for the genes to build an organism which pools almost all its resources to produce offspring as early as possible. Thus we accumulate damages to our body as we age and harbour late-onset diseases such as Huntington&#x27;s disease which have minimum impact on the evolutionary success of our gene overlords.

Genes, Dawkins argues, are indifferent to who or what gets hurt, so long as DNA is passed on. He concludes:

 During the minute it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive; others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear; others are being slowly devoured from within by rasping parasites; thousands of all kinds are dying from starvation, thirst and disease. It must be so. If there is ever a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored.

=== The replication bomb ===
In the last chapter, Dawkins considers how Darwinian evolution may look outside planet Earth. It seems that the trigger event would be the spontaneous arising of self-replicating entities or the phenomenon of heredity. Once this process is initiated, it will launch an explosion of replicating entities until all available resources are used and all vacant niches are taken. Thus the title of the chapter.

Dawkins tries to distill ten milestones from the history of the only one replication bomb we know of, life on Earth. He strips any &quot;local conditions&quot; peculiar to Earth from these milestones which he calls &quot;thresholds&quot;, in the hope that these &quot;thresholds&quot; will be applicable to an alien evolution in an alien planetary system.

From the starting point of the &quot;Replicator Threshold&quot;, we may eventually reach the higher thresholds of &quot;Consciousness&quot;, &quot;Language&quot;, &quot;Technology&quot;, and &quot;Radio&quot;. The final threshold is &quot;Space Travel&quot;. In reaching the Moon, we have hardly made it past the front door.

<text>The von Karman Institute for [[Fluid Dynamics]] (VKI) is a non-profit educational and scientific organization which specializes in three specific fields: aeronautics and aerospace, environment and applied fluid dynamics, turbomachinery and propulsion. Founded in 1956, it is located in Sint-Genesius-Rode, Belgium.

==About==

The von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics is a non-profit international, educational and scientific organization which is working in three specific fields: aeronautics and aerospace, environment and applied fluid dynamics, turbomachinery and propulsion.

The VKI provides education in these specific areas for students from all over the world. A hundred students come to the Institute each year to study fluid dynamics, for a PhD programme, a research master in Fluid Dynamics, a final year project and also to gather further knowledge while doing a work placement in a specific area. 
Each year, Lecture Series and events are being organized inside and outside of the organization. These events emphasize on topics of great importance such as aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer with application to aeronautics, space, turbomachinery, the environment and also industrial fluid dynamics. The Institute has built an international renown in these domains. Students who study these fields, researchers, industrials and engineers want to follow these Lecture Series. The information presented is accurate and reliable.
==History==
In the course of 1955, Professor Theodore von Kármán proposed with his assistants the establishment of an institution devoted to training and research in aerodynamics which would be open to young engineers and scientists of the NATO nations. It was strongly felt that this form of international undertaking would fulfil the important objective of fostering fruitful exchanges and understanding between the participating nations in a well-defined technical field.

The von Karman Institute was established in October 1956 in the buildings which formed what then was the aeronautical laboratory of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Belgian Ministry of Communications.

The history of the laboratory goes back to 1922 when, on farmland purchased by the Belgian Government, the first building was erected to house the STAé (Service Technique de l&#x27;Aéronautique), i.e. the technical services of the Civil Aviation Authority then under the Ministry of Defence. The building was designed to accommodate a large low speed wind tunnel of the Eiffel type with an open return circuit and open-jet test section of 2 m diameter, as well as offices and shops. It still exists and has been refurbished internally after removal of the low speed tunnel to make room for modern turbomachinery and high speed facilities. A second building was added in 1935 to house offices and laboratories. It is now the Institute&#x27;s administrative building. The last addition was made after the war, in 1949, with the construction of a large building specially designed to house a supersonic tunnel and a multi-configuration low speed facility.

The AGARD Study Group of 1955 stated, in terms of training and research: &quot;The Institute should aim toward a training which, apart from its direct and obvious ties with aeronautical industries, would be of value in wider areas such as industrial or scientific research where the application of experimental techniques of aerodynamics would be profitable&quot;.

==Structure==
There are three departments which are hosted at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics, from the older to the younger:
* Aeronautics and Aerospace
A wide spectrum of facilities and computational tools covers the flow range from the low-speed regime of commercial aircraft to the supersonic and hypersonic regime of atmospheric space entry. The department focuses in particular on the modeling, simulation and experimental validation of atmospheric entry flows and thermal protection systems (TPS), including transition to turbulence and stability. The experimental studies are carried out in its top level Mach 14, Mach 6 and Induction Coupled Plasma windtunnels, for which dedicated measuring techniques have been developed e.g. involving spectroscopic laser techniques. On the computational simulation side the department has developed an extendable software platform Coolfluid for high performance computational flow simulation which incorporates the research on numerical algorithms, advanced physico-chemical and plasma models as well as fluid-structure interaction and conjugate heat transfer.
* Turbomachinery &amp; Propulsion
The Turbomachinery and Propulsion department specializes in the aero-thermal aspects of turbomachinery components for aero-engines and industrial gas turbines, space propulsion units, steam turbines and process industry compressors and pumps. It has accumulated wide skills in high speed wind tunnel testing and related measurement techniques development and application. The department has acquired a world recognised expertise on steady/unsteady aerodynamic and aero/thermal aspects of high pressure, including cooling, and low pressure turbomachinery components through the design, development and use of a number of unique wind tunnels.

On the computational side, the department has over 20 years of experience in the analysis of flow in turbomachines, and in the design techniques and multi-disciplinary optimization methods or their components.
* Environmental and applied Fluid Dynamics
The Environmental and Applied Fluid Dynamics (EA) department covers all kinds of activities complementary to the other two departments related to fluid dynamics in the academic and industrial world. It has a large expertise in the study of aeroacoustics, multiphase flows, vehicle aerodynamics, biological flows and environmental flows (including the study of interaction between atmospheric winds and human activities). The department is also involved in the modeling of turbulence and in the development of advanced measurement techniques for fluid dynamics. The department has acquired a unique expertise in the study of fluid dynamics in industrial processes, with the development and construction of experimental facilities dedicated to the study of industrial processes and also in the simulation of industrial flows using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) codes.

==Lecture series==
The VKI organises up to twelve different one-week Lecture Series with about 50 to 60 participants on specialized topics every year on various fields: industrial applications, turbomachinery, aerospace, aerodynamics, propulsion, aero engine, aeroacoustics, biological flows, large eddy simulation.
Each year, the VKI also organises thematic conferences in collaboration with Belgian &amp; foreign universities and research institutes.

These courses have gained worldwide recognition. Subjects are chosen carefully and the lecturers are well known for their professionalism and excellency in specific fields.

<doc id="521801" wikidata="Q27098513" url="?curid=521801" title="Water heating">
<text>Water heating is a heat transfer process that uses an energy source to heat water above its initial temperature. Typical domestic uses of hot water include cooking, cleaning, bathing, and space heating. In industry, hot water and water heated to steam have many uses.

Domestically, water is traditionally heated in vessels known as &quot;water heaters&quot;, &quot;kettles&quot;, &quot;cauldrons&quot;, &quot;pots&quot;, or &quot;coppers&quot;. These metal vessels that heat a batch of water do not produce a continual supply of heated water at a preset temperature. Rarely, hot water occurs naturally, usually from natural hot springs. The temperature varies with the consumption rate, becoming cooler as flow increases.

Appliances that provide a continual supply of hot water are called &quot;water heaters&quot;, &quot;hot water heaters&quot;, &quot;hot water tanks&quot;, &quot;boilers&quot;, &quot;heat exchangers&quot;, &quot;geysers&quot; (Southern Africa and the Arab world), or &quot;calorifiers&quot;. These names depend on region, and whether they heat potable or non-potable water, are in domestic or industrial use, and their energy source. In domestic installations, potable water heated for uses other than space heating is also called &quot;domestic hot water&quot; (&quot;DHW&quot;).

Fossil fuels (natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, oil), or solid fuels are commonly used for heating water. These may be consumed directly or may produce electricity that, in turn, heats water. Electricity to heat water may also come from any other electrical source, such as nuclear power or renewable energy. Alternative energy such as solar energy, heat pumps, hot water heat recycling, and geothermal heating can also heat water, often in combination with backup systems powered by fossil fuels or electricity.

Densely populated urban areas of some countries provide district heating of hot water. This is especially the case in Scandinavia, Finland and Poland. District heating systems supply energy for water heating and space heating from combined heat and power (CHP) plants such as incinerators, central heat pumps, waste heat from industries, geothermal heating, and central solar heating. Actual heating of tap water is performed in heat exchangers at the consumers&#x27; premises. Generally the consumer has no in-building backup system as redundancy is usually significant on the district heating supply side.

Today, in the United States, domestic hot water used in homes is most commonly heated with natural gas, electric resistance, or a heat pump. Electric heat pump water heaters are significantly more efficient than electric resistance water heaters, but also more expensive to purchase. Some energy utilities offer their customers funding to help offset the higher first cost of energy efficient water heaters.

== Types of water heating appliances ==

Hot water used for space heating may be heated by fossil fuels in a boiler, while potable water may be heated in a separate appliance. This is common practice in the US, especially when warm-air space heating is usually employed.

=== Storage water heaters (tank-type) ===


In household and commercial usage, most North American and Southern Asian water heaters are the tank type, also called &quot;storage water heaters&quot;. These consist of a cylindrical vessel or container that keeps water continuously hot and ready to use. Typical sizes for household use range from 75 to 400 L (20 to 100 US gallons). These may use electricity, natural gas, propane, heating oil, solar, or other energy sources. Natural gas heaters are most popular in the US and most European countries, since the gas is often conveniently piped throughout cities and towns and currently is the cheapest to use. In the United States, typical natural gas water heaters for households without unusual needs are with a burner rated at .

This is a popular arrangement where higher flow rates are required for limited periods. Water is heated in a pressure vessel that can withstand a hydrostatic pressure close to that of the incoming mains supply. A pressure reducing valve is sometimes employed to limit the pressure to a safe level for the vessel. In North America, these vessels are called &quot;hot water tanks&quot;, and may incorporate an electrical resistance heater, a heat pump, or a gas or oil burner that heats water directly.

Where hot-water space heating boilers are installed, domestic hot water cylinders are usually heated indirectly by primary water from the boiler, or by an electric immersion heater (often as backup to the boiler). In the UK these vessels are called &quot;indirect cylinders&quot; and &quot;direct cylinders&quot;, respectively. Additionally, if these cylinders form part of a sealed system, providing mains-pressure hot water, they are known as unvented cylinders. In the US, when connected to a boiler, they are called &quot;indirect-fired water heaters&quot;.

Compared to tankless heaters, storage water heaters have the advantage of using energy (gas or electricity) at a relatively slow rate, storing the heat for later use. The disadvantage is that over time, heat escapes through the tank wall and the water cools down, activating the heating system to heat the water back up, so investing in a tank with better insulation improves this standby efficiency. Additionally, when heavy use exhausts the hot water, there is a significant delay before hot water is available again. Larger tanks tend to provide hot water with less temperature fluctuation at moderate flow rates.

Volume storage water heaters in the United States and New Zealand are typically vertical cylindrical tanks, usually standing on the floor, a &#x27;cylinder tray&#x27; or on a platform raised a short distance above the floor. Volume storage water heaters in Spain are typically horizontal. In India, they are mainly vertical. In apartments they can be mounted in the ceiling space over laundry-utility rooms. In Australia, gas and electric outdoor tank heaters have mainly been used (with high temperatures to increase effective capacity), but solar roof tanks are becoming fashionable.

Tiny &quot;point-of-use&quot; (POU) electric storage water heaters with capacities ranging from 832 L (26 gallons) are made for installation in kitchen and bath cabinets or on the wall above a sink. They typically use low power heating elements, about 1 kW to 1.5 kW, and can provide hot water long enough for hand washing, or, if plumbed into an existing hot water line, until hot water arrives from a remote high capacity water heater. They may be used when retrofitting a building with hot water plumbing is too costly or impractical. Since they maintain water temperature thermostatically, they can only supply a continuous flow of hot water at extremely low flow rates, unlike high-capacity tankless heaters.

In tropical countries like Singapore and India, a storage water heater may vary from 10 L to 35 L. Smaller water heaters are sufficient, as ambient weather temperatures and incoming water temperature are moderate. The Coldest regions in India like Kashmir, people are mostly dependent on the storage type electric water heaters. Mostly 50L or 75L Storage type electric water heaters are connected to overhead water source.

===Point-of-use (POU) vs centralized hot water===
A locational design decision may be made between point-of-use and centralized water heaters. Centralized water heaters are more traditional, and are still a good choice for small buildings. For larger buildings with intermittent or occasional hot water use, multiple POU water heaters may be a better choice, since they can reduce long waits for hot water to arrive from a remote heater. The decision where to locate the water heater(s) is only partially independent of the decision of a tanked vs. tankless water heater, or the choice of energy source for the heat.

=== Instantaneous water heaters (tankless-type) ===


Tankless water heaters—also called instantaneous, continuous flow, inline, flash, on-demand, or instant-on water heaters—are gaining in popularity. These high-power water heaters instantly heat water as it flows through the device, and do not retain any water internally except for what is in the heat exchanger coil. Copper heat exchangers are preferred in these units because of their high thermal conductivity and ease of fabrication.

Tankless heaters may be installed throughout a household at more than one point-of-use (POU), far from a central water heater, or larger centralized models may still be used to provide all the hot water requirements for an entire house. The main advantages of tankless water heaters are a plentiful continuous flow of hot water (as compared to a limited flow of continuously heated hot water from conventional tank water heaters), and potential energy savings under some conditions. The main disadvantage is their much higher initial costs; a US study in Minnesota reported a 20- to 40-year payback for the tankless water heaters. In a comparison to a less efficient natural gas fired hot water tank, on-demand natural gas will cost 30% more over its useful life.

Stand-alone appliances for quickly heating water for domestic usage are known in North America as &quot;tankless&quot; or &quot;on demand&quot; water heaters. In some places, they are called &quot;multipoint heaters&quot;, &quot;geysers&quot; or &quot;ascots&quot;. In Australia and New Zealand they are called &quot;instantaneous hot water units&quot;. In Argentina they are called &quot;calefones&quot;. In that country &quot;calefones&quot; use gas instead of electricity, although gas powered tankless water heaters can also be found in other countries. A similar wood-fired appliance was known as the chip heater.

A common arrangement where hot-water space heating is employed is for a boiler also to heat potable water, providing a continuous supply of hot water without extra equipment. Appliances that can supply both space-heating and domestic hot water are called &quot;combination&quot; (or &quot;combi&quot;) boilers. Though on-demand heaters provide a continuous supply of domestic hot water, the rate at which they can produce it is limited by the thermodynamics of heating water from the available fuel supplies.

=== Electric shower heads ===
=== Solar water heaters ===

Increasingly, solar powered water heaters are being used. Their solar collectors are installed outside dwellings, typically on the roof or walls or nearby, and the potable hot water storage tank is typically a pre-existing or new conventional water heater, or a water heater specifically designed for solar thermal. In Cyprus and Israel 90 percent of homes have solar water heating systems.

The most basic solar thermal models are the direct-gain type, in which the potable water is directly sent into the collector. Many such systems are said to use &quot;integrated collector storage&quot; (ICS), as direct-gain systems typically have storage integrated within the collector. Heating water directly is inherently more efficient than heating it indirectly via heat exchangers, but such systems offer very limited freeze protection (if any), can easily heat water to temperatures unsafe for domestic use, and ICS systems suffer from severe heat loss on cold nights and cold, cloudy days.

By contrast, &quot;indirect&quot; or &quot;closed-loop&quot; systems do not allow potable water through the panels, but rather pump a heat transfer fluid (either water or a water/antifreeze mix) through the panels. After collecting heat in the panels, the heat transfer fluid flows through a heat exchanger, transferring its heat to the potable hot water. When the panels are cooler than the storage tank or when the storage tank has already reached its maximum temperature, the controller in closed-loop systems stops the circulation pumps. In a &quot;drainback&quot; system, the water drains into a storage tank contained in conditioned or semi-conditioned space, protected from freezing temperatures. With antifreeze systems, however, the pump &quot;must&quot; be run if the panel temperature gets too hot (to prevent degradation of the antifreeze) or too cold (to prevent the water/antifreeze mixture from freezing.)

&quot;Flat panel collectors&quot; are typically used in closed-loop systems. Flat panels, which often resemble skylights, are the most durable type of collector, and they also have the best performance for systems designed for temperatures within of ambient temperature. Flat panels are regularly used in both pure water and antifreeze systems.

Another type of solar collector is the &quot;evacuated tube collector&quot;, which are intended for cold climates that do not experience severe hail and/or applications where high temperatures are needed (i.e., over ). Placed in a rack, evacuated tube collectors form a row of glass tubes, each containing absorption fins attached to a central heat-conducting rod (copper or condensation-driven). The &quot;evacuated&quot; description refers to the vacuum created in the glass tubes during the manufacturing process, which results in very low heat loss and lets evacuated tube systems achieve extreme temperatures, far in excess of water&#x27;s boiling point.

=== Geothermal heating ===
In countries like Iceland and New Zealand, and other volcanic regions, water heating may be done using geothermal heating, rather than combustion.

=== Gravity-fed system ===
Where a space-heating water boiler is employed, the traditional arrangement in the UK and Ireland is to use boiler-heated (&quot;primary&quot;) water to heat potable (&quot;secondary&quot;) water contained in a cylindrical vessel (usually made of copper)—which is supplied from a cold water storage vessel or container, usually in the roof space of the building. This produces a fairly steady supply of DHW (domestic hot water) at low static pressure head but usually with a good flow. In most other parts of the world, water heating appliances do not use a cold water storage vessel or container, but heat water at pressures close to that of the incoming mains water supply.

=== Other improvements ===
Other improvements to water heaters include check valve devices at their inlet and outlet, cycle timers, electronic ignition in the case of fuel-using models, sealed air intake systems in the case of fuel-using models, and pipe insulation. The sealed air-intake system types are sometimes called &quot;band-joist&quot; intake units. &quot;High-efficiency&quot; condensing units can convert up to 98% of the energy in the fuel to heating the water. The exhaust gases of combustion are cooled and are mechanically ventilated either through the roof or through an exterior wall. At high combustion efficiencies a drain must be supplied to handle the water condensed out of the combustion products, which are primarily carbon dioxide and water vapor.

In traditional plumbing in the UK, the space-heating boiler is set up to heat a separate &quot;hot water cylinder&quot; or &quot;water heater&quot; for potable hot water. Such water heaters are often fitted with an auxiliary electrical &quot;immersion heater&quot; for use if the boiler is out of action for a time. Heat from the space-heating boiler is transferred to the water heater vessel/container by means of a heat exchanger, and the boiler operates at a higher temperature than the potable hot water supply. Most potable water heaters in North America are completely separate from the space heating units, due to the popularity of HVAC/forced air systems in North America.

Residential combustion water heaters manufactured since 2003 in the United States have been redesigned to resist ignition of flammable vapors and incorporate a thermal cutoff switch, per ANSI Z21.10.1. The first feature attempts to prevent vapors from flammable liquids and gases in the vicinity of the heater from being ignited and thus causing a house fire or explosion. The second feature prevents tank overheating due to unusual combustion conditions. These safety requirements were made in response to homeowners storing, or spilling, gasoline or other flammable liquids near their water heaters and causing fires. Since most of the new designs incorporate some type of flame arrestor screen, they require monitoring to make sure they do not become clogged with lint or dust, reducing the availability of air for combustion. If the flame arrestor becomes clogged, the thermal cutoff may act to shut down the heater.

A &quot;wetback stove&quot; (NZ), &quot;wetback heater&quot; (NZ), or &quot;back boiler&quot; (UK), is a simple household secondary water heater using incidental heat. It typically consists of a hot water pipe running behind a fireplace or stove (rather than hot water storage), and has no facility to limit the heating. Modern wetbacks may run the pipe in a more sophisticated design to assist heat-exchange. These designs are being forced out by government efficiency regulations that do not count the energy used to heat water as &#x27;efficiently&#x27; used.

== History ==
Another type of water heater developed in Europe predated the storage model. In London, England, in 1868, Benjamin Waddy Maughan, a painter, invented the first instantaneous domestic water heater that did not use solid fuel. Named the &quot;geyser&quot; after an Icelandic gushing hot spring, Maughan&#x27;s invention made cold water at the top flow through pipes that were heated by hot gases from a burner at the bottom. Hot water then flowed into a sink or tub. The invention was somewhat dangerous because there was no flue to remove heated gases from the bathroom. A water heater is still sometimes called a &quot;geyser&quot; in the UK and South Africa.

Maughn&#x27;s invention influenced the work of a Norwegian mechanical engineer named Edwin Ruud. The first automatic, storage tank-type gas water heater was invented around 1889 by Ruud after he immigrated to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (US). The Ruud Manufacturing Company, still in existence today, made many advancements in tank-type and tankless water heater design and operation.

== Thermodynamics and economics ==

Water typically enters residences in the US at about , depending on latitude and season. Hot water temperatures of are usual for dish-washing, laundry and showering, which requires that the heater raise the water temperature about if the hot water is mixed with cold water at the point of use. The Uniform Plumbing Code reference shower flow rate is per minute. Sink and dishwasher usages range from per minute.

Natural gas is often measured by volume or heat content. Common units of measurement by volume are cubic metre or cubic feet at standard conditions or by heat content in kilowatt hours, British thermal units (BTU) or therm, which is equal to 100,000 BTU. A BTU is the energy required to raise one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. A US gallon of water weighs . To raise of water from to at 90% efficiency requires . A heater, as might exist in a tankless heater, would take about 15 minutes to do this. At $1 per therm, the cost of the gas would be about 40 cents. In comparison, a typical tank electric water heater has a heating element, which at 100% efficient results in a heating time of about 2.34 hours. At $0.16/kWh the electricity would cost $1.68.

Energy efficiencies of water heaters in residential use can vary greatly, particularly depending on manufacturer and model. However, electric heaters tend to be slightly more efficient (not counting power station losses) with recovery efficiency (how efficiently energy transfers to the water) reaching about 98%. Gas-fired heaters have maximum recovery efficiencies of only about 8294% (the remaining heat is lost with the flue gasses). Overall energy factors can be as low as 80% for electric and 50% for gas systems. Natural gas and propane tank water heaters with energy factors of 62% or greater, as well as electric tank water heaters with energy factors of 93% or greater, are considered high-efficiency units. Energy Star-qualified natural gas and propane tank water heaters (as of September 2010) have energy factors of 67% or higher, which is usually achieved using an intermittent pilot together with an automatic flue damper, baffle blowers, or power venting.

Direct electric resistance tank water heaters are &quot;not&quot; included in the Energy Star program; however, the Energy Star program does include electric heat pump units with energy factors of 200% or higher. Tankless gas water heaters (as of 2015) must have an energy factor of 90% or higher for Energy Star qualification. Since electricity production in thermal plants has efficiency levels ranging from only 15% to slightly over 55% (combined cycle gas turbine), with around 40% typical for thermal power stations, direct resistance electric water heating may be the least energy efficient option.

However, use of a heat pump can make electric water heaters much more energy efficient and lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions, even more so if a low carbon source of electricity is used. Using district heating utilizing waste heat from electricity generation and other industries to heat residences and hot water gives an increased overall efficiency, removing the need for burning fossil fuel or using high energy value electricity to produce heat in the individual home.

Fundamentally, it takes a great deal of energy to heat water, as one may experience when waiting to boil a gallon of water on a stove. For this reason, tankless on-demand water heaters require a powerful energy source. A standard 120V, 15-ampere rated wall electric outlet, by comparison, only sources enough power to warm a disappointingly small amount of water: about per minute at temperature elevation.

The energy used by an electric water heater can be reduced by as much as 18% through optimal schedule and temperature control that is based on knowledge of the usage pattern.

===US minimum requirements===
On April 16, 2015, as part of the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA), new minimum standards for efficiency of residential water heaters set by the United States Department of Energy went into effect. All new gas storage tank water heaters with capacities smaller than sold in the United States in 2015 or later shall have an energy factor of at least 60% (for 50-US-gallon units, higher for smaller units), increased from the pre-2015 minimum standard of 58% energy factor for 50-US-gallon gas units. Electric storage tank water heaters with capacities less than 55 US gallons sold in the United States shall have an energy factor of at least 95%, increased from the pre-2015 minimum standard of 90% for 50-US-gallon electric units.

Under the 2015 standard, for the first time, storage water heaters with capacities of 55 US gallons or larger now face stricter efficiency requirements than those of 50 US gallons or less. Under the pre-2015 standard, a gas storage water heater with a nominal input of or less was able to have an energy factor as low as 53%, while under the 2015 standard, the minimum energy factor for a 75-US-gallon gas storage tank water heater is now 74%, which can only be achieved by using condensing technology. Storage water heaters with a nominal input of or greater are not currently affected by these requirements, since energy factor is not defined for such units. An electric storage tank water heater was able to have a minimum energy factor of 86% under the pre-2015 standard, while under the 2015 standard, the minimum energy factor for an 80-gallon electric storage tank water heater is now 197%, which is only possible with heat pump technology. This rating measures efficiency at the point of use.

Depending on how electricity is generated, overall efficiency may be much lower. For example, in a traditional coal plant, only about 30–35% of the energy in the coal ends up as electricity on the other end of the generator. Losses on the electrical grid (including line losses and voltage transformation losses) reduce electrical efficiency further. According to data from the Energy Information Administration, transmission and distribution losses in 2005 consumed 6.1% of net generation. In contrast, 90% of natural gas&#x27;s energy value is
delivered to the consumer. (In neither case is the energy expended exploring, developing and extracting coal or natural gas resources included in the quoted efficiency numbers.) Gas tankless water heaters shall have an energy factor of 82% or greater under the 2015 standards, which corresponds to the pre-2015 Energy Star standard.

In 2022 the Department of Energy proposed rules that would take effect in 2026 and would effectively eliminate inefficient non-condensing gas water heaters in commercial buildings. Non-condensing models waste heat, while condensing models capture and used otherwise lost energy. The change will reduce emissions by 38 million tons of carbon dioxide over 30 years and reduce buildings&#x27; energy costs.

== Water heater safety ==

=== Explosion hazard ===
Water heaters potentially can explode and cause significant damage, injury, or death if certain safety devices are not installed. A safety device called a temperature and pressure relief (T&amp;P or TPR) valve, is normally fitted on the top of the water heater to dump water if the temperature or pressure becomes too high. Most plumbing codes require that a discharge pipe be connected to the valve to direct the flow of discharged hot water to a drain, typically a nearby floor drain, or outside the living space. Some building codes allow the discharge pipe to terminate in the garage.

If a gas or propane fired water heater is installed in a garage or basement, many plumbing codes require that it be elevated at least above the floor to reduce the potential for fire or explosion due to spillage or leakage of combustible liquids in the garage. Furthermore, certain local codes mandate that tank-type heaters in new and retrofit installations must be secured to an adjacent wall by a strap or anchor to prevent tipping over and breaking the water and gas pipes in the event of an earthquake.

For older houses where the water heater is part of the space heating boiler, and plumbing codes allow, some plumbers install an automatic gas shutoff (such as the &quot;Watts 210&quot;) in addition to a TPR valve. When the device senses that the temperature reaches , it shuts off the gas supply and prevents further heating. In addition, an expansion tank or exterior pressure relief valve must be installed to prevent pressure buildup in the plumbing from rupturing pipes, valves, or the water heater.

=== Thermal burns (scalding) ===
Scalding is a serious concern with any water heater. Human skin burns quickly at high temperature, in less than 5 seconds at , but much slower at — it takes a full minute for a second degree burn. Older people and children often receive serious scalds due to disabilities or slow reaction times. In the United States and elsewhere it is common practice to put a tempering valve or thermostatic mixing valve on the outlet of the water heater. The result of &quot;automatically&quot; mixing hot and cold water via a tempering valve is referred to as &quot;tempered water&quot;.

A tempering valve mixes enough cold water with the hot water from the heater to keep the outgoing water temperature fixed at a more moderate temperature, often set to . Without a tempering valve, reduction of the water heater&#x27;s setpoint temperature is the most direct way to reduce scalding. However, for sanitation, hot water is needed at a temperature that can cause scalding. This may be accomplished by using a supplemental heater in an appliance that requires hotter water.
Most residential dishwashing machines, for example, include an internal electric heating element for increasing the water temperature above that provided by a domestic water heater.

=== Bacterial contamination ===

Two conflicting safety issues affect water heater temperature—the risk of scalding from excessively hot water greater than , and the risk of incubating bacteria colonies, particularly &quot;Legionella&quot;, in water that is not hot enough to kill them. Both risks are potentially life-threatening and are balanced by setting the water heater&#x27;s thermostat to . The European Guidelines for Control and Prevention of Travel Associated Legionnaires&#x27; Disease recommend that hot water should be stored at and distributed so that a temperature of at least and preferably is achieved within one minute at points of use.

If there is a dishwasher without a booster heater, it may require a water temperature within a range of for optimum cleaning, but tempering valves set to no more than can be applied to faucets to avoid scalding. Tank temperatures above may produce limescale deposits, which could later harbor bacteria, in the water tank. Higher temperatures may also increase etching of glassware in the dishwasher.

Tank thermostats are not a reliable guide to the internal temperature of the tank. Gas-fired water tanks may have no temperature calibration shown. An electric thermostat shows the temperature at the elevation of the thermostat, but water lower in the tank can be considerably cooler. An outlet thermometer is a better indication of water temperature.

In the renewable energy industry (solar and heat pumps, in particular) the conflict between daily thermal Legionella control and high temperatures, which may drop system performance, is subject to heated debate. In a paper seeking a green exemption from normal Legionellosis safety standards, Europe&#x27;s top CEN solar thermal technical committee TC 312 asserts that a 50% fall in performance would occur if solar water heating systems were heated to the base daily. However some solar simulator analysis work using Polysun 5 suggests that an 11% energy penalty is a more likely figure. Whatever the context, both energy efficiency and scalding safety requirements push in the direction of considerably lower water temperatures than the legionella pasteurization temperature of around .

Legionella pneumophila has been detected at the point of use downstream from horizontally-mounted electric water heaters with volumes of 150 Liters. 
However, legionella can be safely and easily controlled with good design and engineering protocols. For instance raising the temperature of water heaters once a day or even once every few days to at the coldest part of the water heater for 30 minutes effectively controls legionella. In all cases and in particular energy efficient applications, Legionnaires&#x27; disease is more often than not the result of engineering design issues that do not take into consideration the impact of stratification or low flow.

It is also possible to control Legionella risks by chemical treatment of the water. This technique allows lower water temperatures to be maintained in the pipework without the associated Legionella risk. The benefit of lower pipe temperatures is that the heat loss rate is reduced and thus the energy consumption is reduced.

<text>Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters is a 1999 popular science book by the science writer Matt Ridley, published by Fourth Estate. The chapters are numbered for the pairs of human chromosomes, one pair being the X and Y sex chromosomes, so the numbering goes up to 22 with Chapter X and Y couched between Chapters 7 and 8.

The book was welcomed by critics in journals such as &quot;Nature&quot; and newspapers including &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The &quot;London Review of Books&quot; however found the book &quot;at once instructive and infuriating&quot;, as &quot;his right-wing politics lead him to slant the implications of the research&quot;.

==Context==
The book&#x27;s author, Matt Ridley, is a British journalist and businessman, known for writing on science, the environment, and economics. He studied zoology, gaining his DPhil in 1983.

==Structure==
The book devotes one chapter to each pair of human chromosomes. Since one (unnumbered) chapter is required to discuss the sex chromosomes, the final chapter is number 22. Ridley was inspired to adopt this model by Primo Levi&#x27;s book &quot;The Periodic Table&quot;.

;Chapter 1, Life

The first chapter begins with a quote from Alexander Pope on the cycle of life. The very broad topic &quot;Life&quot; is also the topic of the chapter. Ridley discusses the history of the gene briefly, including our &quot;last universal common ancestor&quot;.

;Chapter 2, Species

Ridley discusses the history of human kind as a genetically distinct species. He compares the human genome to chimpanzees, and ancestral primates. He also points out that until the 19th century, most scholars believed that there were 24 sets of genes, not 23 as known today.

;Chapter 3, History

This chapter discusses the interplay between early geneticists, including Gregor Mendel, Charles Darwin, Hermann Joseph Muller and Francis Crick.

;Chapter 4, Fate

Huntington&#x27;s chorea is used to discuss the use of a particular sequence on Chromosome Four to cause traumatic health consequences. The search for the chromosomal source of this and other related diseases is discussed through the work of Nancy Wexler, someone who may have inherited the gene but who turns to scientific work to study it in others.

;Chapter 5, Environment

The concepts of pleiotropy and genetic pluralism are introduced. A brief history of the study of asthma is used as the case study. Asthma is related to as many as fifteen different genes, many on chromosome five. Specifically, this includes a change from adenosine (A) to guanine (G) at position 46 on the ADRB2 gene. The ADRB2 gene is related to the control of bronchodilation and bronchoconstriction.

;Chapter 6, Intelligence

Robert Plomin&#x27;s announcement in 1997 of the discovery of &quot;a gene for intelligence&quot; on chromosome 6 is the foundation for this chapter&#x27;s lengthier discussion of the genetic basis for intelligence. This included gene IGF2R on the long arm of chromosome 6, which may also be related to liver cancer. Ridley continues his premise in this chapter that the use of simple genetic markers is inadequate to describe the complete function of the genome, or the causation of disease.

;Chapter 7, Instinct

This chapter discusses whether the form and existence of language has a genetic component. In particular, &quot;specific language impairment&quot; is possibly related to a gene on chromosome 7. Ridley discusses the scientific disagreement between Canadian linguist Myrna Gopnik and others on whether this disorder relates to difficulties with grammar formulation, or is a broader intellectual disorder.

;Chapter X and Y, Conflict
Ridley contemplates evolutionary psychology using the genes SRY on the Y chromosome, and DAX1 and Xq28 on the X chromosome. The theory of genetic conflict and evolution is debated using the rhetorical question, are we bodies containing genes, or genes in bodies?

;Chapter 8, Self-Interest

Richard Dawkins&#x27;s concept of the &quot;selfish gene&quot; is described by Ridley through a discussion of retrotransposons. This includes the behavior of the LINE-1 and Alu transposons. Further, Ridley discusses the possible purposes of cytosine methylation in development. The chapter also discusses how, through reverse transcriptase, retroviruses like HIV copy themselves to the human genome.

;Chapter 9, Disease

For chromosome 9, the book examines the discussion of the blood-typing genetic sequences. Namely, the ABO blood groups and their impact on evolution are discussed. Other genes mentioned include CFTR for cystic fibrosis. Ridley concludes that the Human Genome Project is largely based on the inaccurate belief that there is one single human genome. Proof that this is wrong comes from answering the question, which of the several choices of blood typing genetic sequence is selected, since each one has different disease-resistant and evolutionary consequences?

;Chapter 10, Stress

The impact of stress on the human body is described starting with the creation of hormones by the CYP17 gene on chromosome 10. Ridley points out the relationship between cholesterol, steroidal hormones such as progesterone, cortisol, aldosterone, testosterone and oestradiol.

;Chapter 11, Personality

Ridley chooses the gene D4DR which codes for the manufacture of dopamine and is located on the short arm of chromosome 11. Interactions between dopamine, serotonin and other serotonin neurochemistry are lightly covered.

;Chapter 12, Self-Assembly

This chapter relates to how understanding the genetic code matches models for embryonic development among vertebrates. Ridley discusses &#x27;gap&#x27; genes, &#x27;pair-rule&#x27; genes, and &#x27;segment-polarity&#x27; genes. Homeotic genes and Hox genes are described briefly. Walter Gehring&#x27;s discovery of the homeobox set of codes in 1983 is related to an on and off switch metaphorically.

;Chapter 13, Pre-History

Ridley describes the relationship between the development of Indo-European and other ancient root languages and the classical polymorphisms which map genetic frequencies in Eurasia. The interplay between the breast cancer genes BRCA2 on chromosome 13 and BRCA1 on chromosome 17 help to illustrate these larger concepts. Ridley also describes genetic studies of different types of peoples to isolate why people developed a mutation allowing adults to digest lactase in adulthood. He concludes that since the herding tribes of the world all evolved this mutation earliest, these people&#x27;s genes adapted to their environment. This may sound like Lamarck&#x27;s tale of the blacksmith&#x27;s strong arms &#x27;handed down&#x27; to his sons, but it is not. The controversial conclusion is that willed action can alter our evolutionary history and genetic composition, by changing the environment to which we have to adapt.

;Chapter 14, Immortality

This chapter examines the so-called &quot;immortality&quot; of the genetic code - i.e. how is it that genetic code can remain as precise as it has been for 50 billion copyings since the dawn of life? Part of the answer is in the protein enzyme telomerase, lying on chromosome 14 and coded by the gene TEP1.

;Chapter 15, Sex

Ridley discusses two chromosome 15 genetic diseases, Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman&#x27;s syndrome: Prader-Willi inherited from the father, Angelman&#x27;s from the mother, through sexual antagonism and the placenta&#x27;s control by paternal genes.

;Chapter 16, Memory

Ridley debates the old knowledge versus instinct problem, claiming that natural selection will be the explanation of the instinct for grammar, and noting that many animals including invertebrates can learn. All the same, he argues that the brain is controlled by genes and gene products.

;Chapter 17, Death

The TP53 gene on chromosome 17 suppresses cancer cells, while oncogenes stimulate cell growth and can cause cancer if kept switched on, while TP53 can cause cancer when kept switched off. Other mutator genes like BRCA1 and BRCA2 contribute to breast cancer.
;Chapter 18, Cures

Recombinant DNA enabled genetic manipulation with restriction enzymes and a ligase. Genetic engineering has been highly controversial, especially in food production; it might, writes Ridley, one day be used in humans.

;Chapter 19, Prevention

It might be possible to prevent or cure Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and coronary heart disease. APO genes like APOE influence fat and cholesterol metabolism. The E4 allele of EPOE contributes to the plaque buildup of Alzheimer&#x27;s. Genetic testing may help patients take early preventative action.

;Chapter 20, Politics

The sheep brain disease scrapie appeared to be infectious but did not involve a microorganism. The disaster of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease in humans was found to be caused by the PRP gene which produces a prion protein that aggregates into clumps, destroying brain cells. Ridley attacks the panicky handling of prion disease outbreaks by governments.
;Chapter 21, Eugenics

Eugenics a century ago, based on faulty knowledge of genetics, led to immoral actions by governments and the US Supreme Court, pushing through compulsory sterilization of people such as those with trisomy 21 which causes Down syndrome. Ridley discusses the conflict between society, in the form of the state, and the individual.

;Chapter 22, Free Will

Ridley addresses the heated debate between genetic determinism and freedom. Children are moulded both by their peers (other children) and by their genes. He argues that behaviour is in the short term unpredictable, but &quot;broadly&quot; predictable in the long term.

==Reception==
&quot;Genome&quot; has been reviewed in scientific journals including &quot;Nature&quot; and in medical journals such as the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;, where Robert Schwartz notes that Ridley speculates, &quot;sometimes wildly&quot;. The book is a &quot;gambol&quot; through the human chromosomes. All the same, Schwartz writes, the book is &quot;instructive, challenging, and fun to read. I envy Ridley&#x27;s talent for presenting, without condescension, complex sets of facts and ideas in terms comprehensible to outsiders.&quot;

Lee M. Silver, reviewing &quot;Genome&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, argues that the book&#x27;s theme is that each individual&#x27;s genome contains &quot;echoes&quot; (Ridley&#x27;s word) of their ancestors&#x27; lives. Silver calls Ridley &quot;adamant&quot; in believing that the use of &quot;personal genetics&quot; must not be left for doctors or governments to control, following on from the mistakes of eugenics a century ago, but that it&#x27;s a fundamental human right to &quot;see and use the messages in their own DNA as they see fit.&quot; Silver describes the book as remarkable for focusing on &quot;pure intellectual discovery&quot;, providing &quot;delightful stories&quot;. He suggests that even practising geneticists will gain a sense of wonder from the &quot;hidden secrets&quot; in the book.

The biologist Jerry Coyne, writing in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, criticises &quot;Genome&quot; as &quot;at once instructive and infuriating. For each nugget of science, Ridley also includes an error or misrepresentation. Some of these derive from poor scholarship: others from his political agenda.&quot; For example, Coyne mentions Ridley&#x27;s incorrect claim that &quot;half of your IQ is inherited&quot;; that Ridley assumes that the marker used by Robert Plomin, IGF2R, is the purported &quot;intelligence gene&quot; that it marks; and that social influences on behaviour [always] work by switching genes on and off, something that Coyne states is &quot;occasionally true&quot;. Coyne argues that Ridley is an &quot;implacable&quot; genetic determinist, denying the influence of the environment, and calling his politics &quot;right-wing&quot;. He calls the book&#x27;s structure &quot;eccentric&quot; and &quot;bizarre&quot;, the chapters matching the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, and notes that &quot;Genome&quot; is the third of Ridley&#x27;s books that &quot;tries to popularise&quot; evolutionary psychology.

The science writer Michael Shermer finds Ridley&#x27;s technique &quot;at once clever and delimiting: Each chapter represents a chromosome, for which he has chosen a single entity supposedly determined or influenced by that chromosome.&quot; In Shermer&#x27;s view, &quot;It is a facile literary device to help readers get their minds around this illimitable subject, but I fear that it gives the wrong impression, disclaimers notwithstanding, that such things as intelligence, instinct, or self-interest are wholly located on that chromosome (and, therefore, genetically programmed and biologically determined).&quot;

==Awards and distinctions==
&quot;Genome&quot; was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize in 2000.

<text>In mathematics, the Iwahori–Hecke algebra, or Hecke algebra, named for Erich Hecke and Nagayoshi Iwahori, is a deformation of the group algebra of a Coxeter group.

Hecke algebras are quotients of the group rings of Artin braid groups. This connection found a spectacular application in Vaughan Jones&#x27; construction of new invariants of knots. Representations of Hecke algebras led to discovery of quantum groups by Michio Jimbo. Michael Freedman proposed Hecke algebras as a foundation for topological quantum computation.

==Hecke algebras of Coxeter groups==
Start with the following data:

* (&quot;W&quot;, &quot;S&quot;) is a Coxeter system with the Coxeter matrix &quot;M&quot; = (&quot;m&quot;&quot;st&quot;), 
* &quot;R&quot; is a commutative ring with identity,
* {&quot;qs&quot; | &quot;s&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot;} is a family of units of &quot;R&quot; such that &quot;qs&quot; = &quot;qt&quot; whenever &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are conjugate in &quot;W&quot;, and
* &quot;A&quot; is the ring of Laurent polynomials over &quot;R&quot; with indeterminates &quot;qs&quot; (and the above restriction that &quot;qs&quot; = &quot;qt&quot; whenever &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are conjugate), that is, &quot;A&quot; = &quot;R&quot;[&quot;q&quot;].

===Multiparameter Hecke algebras===
The &quot;multiparameter Hecke algebra&quot; &quot;HR&quot;(&quot;W&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) is a unital, associative &quot;R&quot;-algebra with generators &quot;Ts&quot; for all &quot;s&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot; that satisfy the following relations:
* Braid Relations: for each pair &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot; in &quot;S&quot; for which &quot;mst&quot; &lt; ∞ factors, a relation &quot;Ts Tt Ts&quot; ... = &quot;Tt Ts Tt&quot; ..., where each side has &quot;mst&quot; factors; and
* Quadratic Relation: for all &quot;s&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, a relation (&quot;Ts&quot; − &quot;qs&quot;)(&quot;Ts&quot; + 1) = 0.

Warning: in later books and papers, Lusztig used a modified form of the quadratic relation that reads formula_1 After extending the scalars to include the half-integer powers &quot;q&quot; the resulting Hecke algebra is isomorphic to the previously defined one (but the &quot;Ts&quot; here corresponds to &quot;q&quot; &quot;T&quot;s in our notation). While this does not change the general theory, many formulae look different.

===Generic multiparameter Hecke algebras===
The algebra &quot;HA&quot;(&quot;W&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) is the &quot;generic&quot; multiparameter Hecke algebra. This algebra is universal in the sense that every other multiparameter Hecke algebra can be obtained from it via the (unique) ring homomorphism &quot;A&quot; → &quot;R&quot; which maps the indeterminate &quot;qs&quot; ∈ &quot;A&quot; to the unit &quot;qs&quot; ∈ &quot;R&quot;. This homomorphism turns &quot;R&quot; into a &quot;A&quot;-algebra and the scalar extension &quot;HA&quot;(&quot;W&quot;, &quot;S&quot;) ⊗&quot;A&quot; &quot;R&quot; is canonically isomorphic to the Hecke algebra &quot;HR&quot;(&quot;W&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) as constructed above. One calls this process &quot;specialization&quot; of the generic algebra.

=== One-parameter Hecke algebras ===
If one specializes every indeterminate &quot;qs&quot; to a single indeterminate &quot;q&quot; over the integers (or &quot;q&quot; to &quot;q&quot;1/2, respectively), then one obtains the so-called generic one-parameter Hecke algebra of (&quot;W&quot;, &quot;S&quot;).

Since in Coxeter groups with single laced Dynkin diagrams (for example Coxeter groups of type A and D) every pair of Coxeter generators is conjugated, the above-mentioned restriction of &quot;qs&quot; being equal &quot;qt&quot; whenever &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are conjugated in &quot;W&quot; forces the multiparameter and the one-parameter Hecke algebras to be equal. Therefore, it is also very common to only look at one-parameter Hecke algebras.

=== Coxeter groups with weights ===
If an integral weight function is defined on &quot;W&quot; (i.e., a map &quot;L&quot;: &quot;W&quot; → Z with &quot;L&quot;(&quot;vw&quot;) = &quot;L&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) + &quot;L&quot;(&quot;w&quot;) for all &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;W&quot; with &quot;l&quot;(&quot;vw&quot;) = &quot;l&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) + &quot;l&quot;(&quot;w&quot;)), then a common specialization to look at is the one induced by the homomorphism &quot;qs&quot; ↦ &quot;q&quot;&quot;L&quot;(&quot;s&quot;), where &quot;q&quot; is a single indeterminate over Z.

If one uses the convention with half-integer powers, then weight function &quot;L&quot;: &quot;W&quot; → Z may be permitted as well. For technical reasons it is also often convenient only to consider positive weight functions.

== Properties ==
1. The Hecke algebra has a basis formula_2 over &quot;A&quot; indexed by the elements of the Coxeter group &quot;W&quot;. In particular, &quot;H&quot; is a free &quot;A&quot;-module. If formula_3 is a reduced decomposition of &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;W&quot;, then formula_4. This basis of Hecke algebra is sometimes called the natural basis. The neutral element of &quot;W&quot; corresponds to the identity of &quot;H&quot;: &quot;Te&quot; = 1.

2. The elements of the natural basis are &quot;multiplicative&quot;, namely, &quot;Tyw&quot; = &quot;Ty Tw&quot; whenever &quot;l&quot;(&quot;yw&quot;) = &quot;l&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) + &quot;l&quot;(&quot;w&quot;), where &quot;l&quot; denotes the length function on the Coxeter group &quot;W&quot;.

3. Elements of the natural basis are invertible. For example, from the quadratic relation we conclude that &quot;T&quot; = &quot;q&quot; &quot;Ts&quot; + (&quot;q&quot;−1).

4. Suppose that &quot;W&quot; is a finite group and the ground ring is the field C of complex numbers. Jacques Tits has proved that if the indeterminate &quot;q&quot; is specialized to any complex number outside of an explicitly given list (consisting of roots of unity), then the resulting one-parameter Hecke algebra is semisimple and isomorphic to the complex group algebra C[&quot;W&quot;] (which also corresponds to the specialization &quot;q&quot; ↦ 1) .

5. More generally, if &quot;W&quot; is a finite group and the ground ring &quot;R&quot; is a field of characteristic zero, then the one-parameter Hecke algebra is a semisimple associative algebra over &quot;R&quot;[&quot;q&quot;±1]. Moreover, extending earlier results of Benson and Curtis, George Lusztig provided an explicit isomorphism between the Hecke algebra and the group algebra after the extension of scalars to the quotient field of &quot;R&quot;[&quot;q&quot;±1/2]
== Canonical basis ==

A great discovery of Kazhdan and Lusztig was that a Hecke algebra admits a &quot;different&quot; basis, which in a way controls representation theory of a variety of related objects.

The generic multiparameter Hecke algebra, &quot;HA&quot;(&quot;W&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;q&quot;), has an involution &quot;bar&quot; that maps &quot;q&quot;1/2 to &quot;q&quot;−1/2 and acts as identity on Z. Then &quot;H&quot; admits a unique ring automorphism &quot;i&quot; that is semilinear with respect to the bar involution of &quot;A&quot; and maps &quot;Ts&quot; to &quot;T&quot;. It can further be proved that this automorphism is involutive (has order two) and takes any &quot;Tw&quot; to formula_5

 Kazhdan - Lusztig Theorem: For each &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;W&quot; there exists a unique element formula_6 which is invariant under the involution &quot;i&quot; and if one writes its expansion in terms of the natural basis:
::formula_7
one has the following:
* &quot;P&quot;&quot;w&quot;,&quot;w&quot; = 1, 
* &quot;P&quot;&quot;y&quot;,&quot;w&quot; in Z[&quot;q&quot;] has degree less than or equal to (&quot;l&quot;(&quot;w&quot;) − &quot;l&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) − 1) if &quot;y&quot; &lt; &quot;w&quot; in the Bruhat order,
* &quot;P&quot;&quot;y&quot;,&quot;w&quot;=0 if formula_8

The elements formula_6 where &quot;w&quot; varies over &quot;W&quot; form a basis of the algebra &quot;H&quot;, which is called the &quot;dual canonical basis&quot; of the Hecke algebra &quot;H&quot;. The &quot;canonical basis&quot; {&quot;C&quot;w | &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;W&quot;} is obtained in a similar way. The polynomials &quot;P&quot;&quot;y&quot;,&quot;w&quot;(&quot;q&quot;) making appearance in this theorem are the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials.

The Kazhdan–Lusztig notions of left, right and two-sided &quot;cells&quot; in Coxeter groups are defined through the behavior of the canonical basis under the action of &quot;H&quot;.

== Hecke algebra of a locally compact group ==

Iwahori–Hecke algebras first appeared as an important special case of a very general construction in group theory. Let (&quot;G&quot;, &quot;K&quot;) be a pair consisting of a unimodular locally compact topological group &quot;G&quot; and a closed subgroup &quot;K&quot; of &quot;G&quot;. Then the space of &quot;K&quot;-biinvariant continuous functions of compact support, &quot;Cc&quot;(&quot;K&quot;\&quot;G&quot;/&quot;K&quot;), can be endowed with a structure of an associative algebra under the operation of convolution. This algebra is denoted by &quot;H&quot;(&quot;G&quot;//&quot;K&quot;) and called the Hecke ring of the pair (&quot;G&quot;, &quot;K&quot;).

Example: If &quot;G&quot; = SL(&quot;n&quot;, Q&quot;p&quot;) and &quot;K&quot; = SL(&quot;n&quot;, Z&quot;p&quot;) then the Hecke ring is commutative and its representations were studied by Ian G. Macdonald. More generally if (&quot;G&quot;, &quot;K&quot;) is a Gelfand pair then the resulting algebra turns out to be commutative.

Example: If &quot;G&quot; = SL(2, Q) and &quot;K&quot; = SL(2, Z) we get the abstract ring behind Hecke operators in the theory of modular forms, which gave the name to Hecke algebras in general.

The case leading to the Hecke algebra of a finite Weyl group is when &quot;G&quot; is the finite Chevalley group over a finite field with &quot;pk&quot; elements, and &quot;B&quot; is its Borel subgroup. Iwahori showed that the Hecke ring &quot;H&quot;(&quot;G&quot;//&quot;B&quot;) is obtained from the generic Hecke algebra &quot;H&quot;q of the Weyl group &quot;W&quot; of &quot;G&quot; by specializing the indeterminate &quot;q&quot; of the latter algebra to &quot;pk&quot;, the cardinality of the finite field. George Lusztig remarked in 1984 (&quot;Characters of reductive groups over a finite field&quot;, xi, footnote):

:&quot;I think it would be most appropriate to call it the Iwahori algebra, but the name Hecke ring (or algebra) given by Iwahori himself has been in use for almost 20 years and it is probably too late to change it now.&quot;

Iwahori and Matsumoto (1965) considered the case when &quot;G&quot; is a group of points of a reductive algebraic group over a non-archimedean local field &quot;K&quot;, such as Q&quot;p&quot;, and &quot;K&quot; is what is now called an Iwahori subgroup of &quot;G&quot;. The resulting Hecke ring is isomorphic to the Hecke algebra of the affine Weyl group of &quot;G&quot;, or the affine Hecke algebra, where the indeterminate &quot;q&quot; has been specialized to the cardinality of the residue field of &quot;K&quot;.

Work of Roger Howe in the 1970s and his papers with Allen Moy on representations of &quot;p&quot;-adic GL(&quot;n&quot;) opened a possibility of classifying irreducible admissible representations of reductive groups over local fields in terms of appropriately constructed Hecke algebras. (Important contributions were also made by Joseph Bernstein and Andrey Zelevinsky.) These ideas were taken much further in Colin Bushnell and Philip Kutzko&#x27;s &quot;theory of types&quot;, allowing them to complete the classification in the general linear case. Many of the techniques can be extended to other reductive groups, which remains an area of active research. It has been conjectured that all Hecke algebras that are ever needed are mild generalizations of affine Hecke algebras.

== Representations of Hecke algebras ==
It follows from Iwahori&#x27;s work that complex representations of Hecke algebras of finite type are intimately related with the structure of the spherical principal series representations of finite Chevalley groups.

George Lusztig pushed this connection much further and was able to describe most of the characters of finite groups of Lie type in terms of representation theory of Hecke algebras. This work used a mixture of geometric techniques and various reductions, led to introduction of various objects generalizing Hecke algebras and detailed understanding of their representations (for &quot;q&quot; not a root of unity). Modular representations of Hecke algebras and representations at roots of unity turned out to be related with the theory of canonical bases in affine quantum groups and combinatorics.

Representation theory of affine Hecke algebras was developed by Lusztig with a view towards applying it to description of representations of &quot;p&quot;-adic groups. It is different in many ways from the finite case. A generalization of affine Hecke algebras, called &quot;double affine Hecke algebra&quot;, was used by Ivan Cherednik in his proof of the Macdonald&#x27;s constant term conjecture.

<text>D channel (delta channel) is a telecommunications term which refers to the ISDN channel in which the control and signalling information is carried. 

The bit rate of the D channel of a basic rate interface is 16 kbit/s, whereas it amounts to 64 kbit/s on a primary rate interface.

For DSS1 signalling, the D channel layer 2 protocol is Q.921 also called LAPD and it carries Layer 3 messages according to Q.931 protocol.

<doc id="521817" wikidata="Q897446" url="?curid=521817" title="Nidaros">
<text>Nidaros, Niðarós or Niðaróss () was the medieval name of Trondheim when it was the capital of Norway&#x27;s first Christian kings. It was named for its position at the mouth (Old Norse: &quot;óss&quot;) of the River Nid (the present-day Nidelva).

Although the capital was later moved to Oslo (around the year 1300), Nidaros remained the centre of Norway&#x27;s spiritual life until the Protestant Reformation. The Archdiocese of Nidaros was separated from Lund (in Scania) by the papal legate Nicholas Breakspeare in 1152, and the shrine to Saint Olaf in Nidaros Cathedral was Northern Europe&#x27;s most important pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages. Archbishop Olav Engelbrektsson led Norway in its attempted resistance against the Danish Reformation, and was forced into exile by King Christian III in 1537. The archdiocese was abolished and replaced with a Lutheran diocese.

== Pre-Reformation ==

The Christianization of Norway was begun by Haakon the Good (d. 961) and was continued by Olaf Trygvesson (d. 1000) and Saint Olaf Haraldsson (d. 1030), two Vikings who had converted (and been baptized) at Andover in England and Rouen in Normandy, respectively. Olaf Trygvesson founded Nidaros in 997, and built a Kongsgård estate and church there. From this base, he worked to spread Christianity in Norway, Orkney, Shetland, the Faroes, Iceland, and Greenland.

Olaf Haraldsson established Nidaros as a see, and installed the monk Grimkill as its first bishop. Since Norway had no universities at the time, many English and German priests were brought in for its parishes and dioceses. The Norwegian bishops were at first dependent on Hamburg, and then (after 1103) on Lund in Denmark.

Pope Eugene III resolved to create a metropolitan see at Nidaros, and sent Nicholas Breakspeare as his legate in 1151. Nicholas installed Jon Birgerson, bishop of Stavanger, as the first archbishop of Nidaros. The bishops of Oslo (established 1073), Bergen (c. 1060), Stavanger (1130), Hamar (1151), Orkney (1070), Skálholt (1056) and Hólar (1105) in Iceland, and Garđar in Greenland were made its suffragans.

Jon Birgerson was succeeded as archbishop by Eystein (Beatus Augustinus, 1158–88), former royal secretary and treasurer and an intelligent, strong-willed, pious man. Those characteristics were needed to defend the Catholic Church against King Sverre, who wanted to make the church a tool of temporal power. The archbishop fled from him to England, returning after a lukewarm reconciliation with the king. Sverre renewed his attacks at Eystein&#x27;s death, and Archbishop Eric took refuge with Archbishop Absalon of Lund. When Sverre attacked the papal legate, Pope Innocent III placed the king and his partisans under interdict.
King Håkon III Sverresson (1202), son and successor of Sverre, made peace with the church whose liberty was preserved by the support of the pope and his archbishops. Norwegian Protestant ecclesiastical historian Anton Christian Bang asked what would have happened &quot;if the Church, deprived of all liberty, had become the submissive slave of absolute royalty? What influence would it have exercised at a time when its chief mission was to act as the educator of the people and as the necessary counterpoise to defend the liberty of the people against the brutal whims of the secular lords? And what would have happened when a century later royalty left the country? After that time the Church was, in reality, the sole centre of which was grouped the whole national life of our country&quot;.

To regulate ecclesiastical affairs (which had suffered during the struggles with Sverre), Innocent IV sent Cardinal William of Sabina as legate to Norway in 1247. He intervened against encroachments by bishops, reformed abuses, and abolished the ordeal by hot iron. Due to the papal legates, Norway became more closely linked with the pope. Secular priests and Benedictines, Cistercians, Augustinians, Dominicans, and Franciscans worked together for the prosperity of the church. Archbishops Eilif Kortin (d. 1332), Paul Baardson (d. 1346) and Arne Vade (d. 1349) were most notable. Provincial councils were held at which efforts were made to eliminate abuses and to encourage Christian education and morality.

St. Olaf, Norway&#x27;s patron saint and &quot;Rex perpetuus Norvegiae&quot; (perpetual king of Norway), is entombed at Nidaros and the national and ecclesiastical life of the country was centred there. His tomb was a site of pilgrimage. The feast of St. Olaf on 29 July was a day of reunion for &quot;all the nations of the Northern seas, Norwegians, Swedes, Goths, Cimbrians, Danes and Slavs&quot; in the cathedral of Nidaros, where the saint&#x27;s reliquary was near the altar. Built in Romanesque style by King Olaf Kyrre (d. 1093), the cathedral was enlarged by Archbishop Eystein in ogival style. It was finished in 1248 by Archbishop Sigurd Sim. Although the cathedral was damaged several times by fire, it was restored each time until the Reformation.

Archbishop Erik Valkendorf was exiled in 1521. His successor, Olaf Engelbrektsson (the instrument of the royal will in the introduction of Lutheranism and a partisan of King Christian II of Denmark and Norway), fled from the threat of Christian III (1537). The reliquaries of St. Olaf and St. Augustine (Eystein) were taken to Copenhagen and melted down. The bones of St. Olaf were buried, unmarked, in the cathedral.

== Present day ==
When Norway regained self-rule as a separate kingdom in a union with Sweden in 1814, a period of national romanticism began in which attention was paid to the remnants of the independent medieval kingdom. It was resolved to restore the ancient cathedral of Nidaros.

Trondheim briefly changed its name back to Nidaros on January 1, 1930. After widespread opposition to the name, the Norwegian Parliament (led by Ivar Lykke) restored the city&#x27;s name on March 6, 1931.

The pilgrimage route to Nidaros Cathedral has been revived. Using Norwegian spelling, the route is known as Saint Olav&#x27;s Way. The main, route begins in the ruins of Oslo&#x27;s Old City (Gamlebyen) and heads north along the lake Mjøsa, up Gudbrandsdalen, over Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to the cathedral. Oslo has an office to advise pilgrims, and the Trondheim cathedral has a pilgrim centre which awards certificates to pilgrims who complete their journey.

The modern Lutheran diocese of Trondheim is known as Nidaros. The Roman Catholic archdiocese, suppressed in 1537, was restored as the Mission sui iuris of central Norway (on territory split off from the Apostolic Vicariate of Norway) on April 7, 1931. In 1935 it became the apostolic prefecture of central Norway, the apostolic vicariate of central Norway on February 4, 1953, and became the Roman Catholic Territorial Prelature of Trondheim on March 28, 1979.

<text>Cloris Leachman (April 30, 1926 – January 27, 2021) was an American actress and comedienne whose career spanned nearly eight decades. She won many accolades, including eight Primetime Emmy Awards from 22 nominations, making her the most nominated and, along with Julia Louis-Dreyfus, most awarded performer in Emmy history. Leachman also won an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe Award. In her early career, she was known for her versatility. Another unique trait of Leachman&#x27;s acting style was her distinctive physicality, where she used props to accentuate and express her roles&#x27; characterizations.

Born and raised in Des Moines, Iowa, Leachman attended Northwestern University and began appearing in local plays as a teenager. After competing in the 1946 Miss America pageant, she secured a scholarship to study under Elia Kazan at the Actors Studio in New York City, making her professional debut in 1948. In film, she appeared in Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; (1971) as a neglected 1950s housewife who has an affair with a student of her husband, a high-school gym teacher; she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. She was part of Mel Brooks&#x27;s ensemble cast, playing Frau Blücher in &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; (1974), Nurse Diesel in &quot;High Anxiety&quot; (1977) and Madame Defarge in &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot; (1981).

Leachman won Emmys for her role on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; (1970–1975) and a Golden Globe for the spinoff &quot;Phyllis&quot; (1975–1977), in which she starred. She also appeared in television film &quot;A Brand New Life&quot; (1973); the variety sketch show &quot;Cher&quot; (1975); the ABC Afterschool Special production &quot;The Woman Who Willed a Miracle&quot; (1983); and the television shows &quot;Promised Land&quot; (1998) and &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; (2000–2006). Her other television credits include &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (1961), &quot;Wagon Train&quot; (1962), 
&quot;The Virginian&quot; (1967),

She wrote her memoir &quot;Cloris: My Autobiography&quot; (2009).

== Early life and education ==
Leachman was born on April 30, 1926, in Des Moines, Iowa, the eldest of three daughters. Her parents were Cloris (&quot;née&quot; Wallace) and Berkeley Claiborne &quot;Buck&quot; Leachman. Her father worked at the family-owned Leachman Lumber Company. Her youngest sister, Claiborne Cary, was an actress and singer. Her other sister, Mary, was not in show business. Their maternal grandmother was of Bohemian (Czech) descent. Leachman attended Theodore Roosevelt High School. 

As a teenager, Leachman appeared in plays by local youth on weekends at Drake University in Des Moines. After graduating from high school, she enrolled at Northwestern University in the School of Education. At Northwestern, she became a member of Gamma Phi Beta and was a classmate of future comic actors Paul Lynde and Charlotte Rae. She began appearing on television and in films shortly after competing in Miss America in 1946 as Miss Chicago.

==Career==
=== 1948–1967: Rise to prominence ===

After winning a scholarship in the Miss America pageant, placing in the top 16, Leachman studied acting under Elia Kazan at the Actors Studio in New York City. She had been cast as a replacement for the role of Nellie Forbush during the original run of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;South Pacific&quot;. A few years later, she appeared in the Broadway-bound production of William Inge&#x27;s &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot;, but left the show before it reached Broadway when Katharine Hepburn asked her to co-star in a production of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot;. Leachman was slated to play the role of Abigail Williams in the original Broadway cast of Arthur Miller&#x27;s seminal drama &quot;The Crucible&quot;. The production played four preview performances at the Playhouse Theatre in Wilmington, Delaware, from January 15–17, 1953, prior to opening on Broadway on January 22. However, Leachman left the production the day before opening night in Wilmington, with Madeleine Sherwood assuming the role. Leachman&#x27;s name was heavily publicized prior to the production&#x27;s opening, and her name still appeared in the printed program; a sign appeared at the box office in Wilmington noting the change. 

Leachman appeared in many live television broadcasts in the 1950s, including such programs as &quot;Suspense&quot; and &quot;Studio One&quot;. She played opposite John Forsythe in &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; Season 1, Episode 2 &quot;Premonition&quot;, which aired 10/8/1955. She also briefly held the role of the mother of &quot;Lassie&#x27;s&quot; second master Timmy (Jon Provost) until she was replaced late in her only season with the cast by June Lockhart due to contract disputes. She made her feature-film debut as an extra in &quot;Carnegie Hall&quot; (1947), but her first real role was in Robert Aldrich&#x27;s film noir &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;, released in 1955. Leachman was several months pregnant during the filming, and appears in one scene running down a darkened highway wearing only a trench coat. A year later, she appeared opposite Paul Newman and Lee Marvin in &quot;The Rack&quot; (1956). She appeared with Newman again in a brief role in &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969).

She continued to work mainly in television, with appearances on &quot;Rawhide&quot; and in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life&quot;, as well as the sequel &quot;It&#x27;s Still a Good Life&quot; in the 2002–2003 UPN series revival. During this period, Leachman appeared opposite John Forsythe on the anthology &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; in an episode titled &quot;Premonition&quot; (1955). In 1956 she guest starred as &quot;Flory Tibbs&quot;, in a complex role as an abused captive on the TV Western &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in S2E1&#x27;s &quot;Legal Revenge&quot;. She later appeared as Ruth Martin, Timmy Martin&#x27;s adoptive mother, in the last half of season four (1957) of &quot;Lassie&quot;. Jon Provost, who played Timmy, said, &quot;Cloris did not feel particularly challenged by the role. Basically, when she realized that all she&#x27;d be doing was baking cookies, she wanted out.&quot; She was replaced by June Lockhart in 1958.

That same year, she appeared in an episode of &quot;One Step Beyond&quot; titled &quot;The Dark Room&quot;, with &quot;Marcel Dalio&quot;, in which she portrayed an American photographer living in Paris. In 1960, she played Marilyn Parker, the roommate of Janice Rule&#x27;s character, Elena Nardos, in the &quot;Checkmate&quot; episode &quot;The Mask of Vengeance&quot;. In 1961, she starred as Boni, a cold-hearted woman that would sell out her man for $500 in the TV Western &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (S6E36 - &quot;For The Love of Money). She appeared in The Twilight Zone S3 E8 &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life&quot; which aired 11/2/1961. Also in 1961, she appeared in The Donna Reed Show (S4E4 - Mouse at Play) as Donna Stone&#x27;s friend Iris. In 1962, she appeared in &quot;The Nancy Davis Story&quot; as a forlorn bar maid desperate for love on &quot;Wagon Train&quot; (S5E33), plus she co-starred in &quot;Trial by Fire&quot;, on an episode of &quot;Laramie&quot; that same year, as well as the &quot;Where Beauty Lies&quot; episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; opposite George Nader. In 1966, she guest-starred on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; as Gloria Shine in &quot;The Case of the Crafty Kidnapper&quot;. In late 1970, Leachman starred in one episode of &quot;That Girl&quot; as Don Hollinger&#x27;s sister, Sandy.

=== 1968–1989: Stardom and acclaim ===

In the drama film &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; (1971), based on the bestselling book by Larry McMurtry, Leachman played Ruth Popper, the high-school gym teacher&#x27;s neglected wife, with whom Timothy Bottoms&#x27; character has an affair. The part was originally offered to Ellen Burstyn, but Burstyn wanted another role in the film. Director Peter Bogdanovich correctly predicted during production that Leachman would win an Oscar for her performance; she won for Best Supporting Actress. Critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote of her performance, &quot;The only real warmth comes from the Leachman ...The film is above all an evocation of mood. It is about a town with no reason to exist, and people with no reason to live there. The only hope is in transgression, as Ruth knows when she seduces Sonny, the boy half her age.&quot; 

Leachman won acclaim portraying Phyllis Lindstrom on the CBS sitcom &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. She acted alongside Mary Tyler Moore, Valerie Harper, Ed Asner, Ted Knight, and Betty White. Leachman played the recurring role of Mary Richards&#x27; snobbish, self-absorbed and interfering (but at heart well-meaning) downstairs neighbor on the program for five years. The role earned her two Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. She was subsequently featured in a spinoff series, &quot;Phyllis&quot; (1975–1977), for which Leachman won a Golden Globe Award. The series ran for two seasons. Leachman won a record-setting eight Primetime and one Daytime Emmy Awards, in addition to having been nominated more than 20 times.
Leachman appeared in three Mel Brooks films including the comedic horror satire &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; (1974), in which the mere mention of the name of her character, Frau Blücher, elicits the loud neighing of horses (an homage to a cinematic villain stereotype). Christopher Connor of &quot;The Film Magazine&quot; wrote of her role that it provides &quot;fine contrasts and plenty of comedic moments&quot;. She also acted in his thriller spoof &quot;High Anxiety&quot; (1977) as the demented villainess and psychiatric nurse Charlotte Diesel. In the epic satire &quot;History of the World: Part I&quot; (1981) she portrayed Madame Defarge.

In 1977, she guest-starred on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, episode 2.24. In 1978, she won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theater. Leachman appeared in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The North Avenue Irregulars&quot; in 1979, playing the role of Claire. In 1987, she hosted the VHS releases of &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; and portrayed the evil witch Griselda for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Cannon Tales&quot; production of &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;. In 1986, she returned to television, replacing Charlotte Rae&#x27;s character Edna Garrett as the den mother in &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;. Leachman&#x27;s role as Edna&#x27;s sister, Beverly Ann Stickle, continued until the end of the series two years later.

=== 1989–2021: Final roles ===

In 1989, Leachman starred on Brooks&#x27; short-lived NBC sitcom &quot;The Nutt House&quot; in dual roles as head hotel housekeeper Mrs. Frick (a variation of the Frau Blücher character) and Mrs. Nutt, the senile owner of the hotel. During this time she worked as a voice actor in numerous animated films, including &quot;My Little Pony: The Movie&quot; (as the evil witch mother from the Volcano of Gloom), &quot;A Troll in Central Park&quot; (as Queen Gnorga), &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, &quot;Gen13&quot;, and most notably as the voice of the cantankerous sky pirate Dola in Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s 1986 feature &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;. She played a reclusive but eventually friendly neighbor who regains her Christmas spirit in &quot;Prancer&quot;. She played Ferris and Jeannie’s grandmother in the one season television series Ferris Bueller (TV series), episode 9, which aired in November of 1990. In 1993 she played a convincing Granny in the Penelope Spheeris film &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. In 1999 Leachman starred in ‘Thanks’, a sitcom about a 17th century Puritan family that was cancelled after six episodes. Leachman played embittered, greedy, Slavic Canadian &quot;Grandma Ida&quot; on the Fox sitcom &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, for which she won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (2006). She was nominated for playing the character for six consecutive years.

Leachman&#x27;s later television credits include the Lifetime Television miniseries &quot;Beach Girls&quot; with Rob Lowe and Julia Ormond. She took a comedic role as the wine-soaked former jazz singer and grandmother Evelyn in &quot;Spanglish&quot; (2004) opposite Adam Sandler for which she was nominated for a SAG Award. She had replaced an ailing Anne Bancroft in the role. The film reunited her with the &quot;Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; writer, producer, and director James L. Brooks. That same year, she appeared with Sandler again in the remake of &quot;The Longest Yard&quot;. She also appeared in the Kurt Russell comedy &quot;Sky High&quot; as a school nurse with X-ray vision. In 2005, she guest-starred as Charlie Harper&#x27;s neighbor Norma in an episode (&quot;Madame and Her Special Friend&quot;) of &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;.

In 2006, Leachman&#x27;s performance alongside Sir Ben Kingsley and Annette Bening in the HBO special &quot;Mrs. Harris&quot; earned her nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. She auditioned to revive her role from &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; in the 2007 Broadway production opposite Megan Mullally (who replaced Kristin Chenoweth) and Roger Bart. Andrea Martin was cast instead. Brooks was quoted as joking that Leachman, then 81, was too old for the role. &quot;We don&#x27;t want her to die on stage,&quot; Brooks (also 81, at the time) told columnist Army Archerd, a statement to which Leachman took umbrage. However, due to Leachman&#x27;s success on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, Brooks then, doing a U-turn, reportedly asked her to reprise her role as Frau Blücher in the Broadway production of &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; after the departure of Beth Leavel, who had succeeded Martin. The Broadway production closed before this could happen.

In 2008, Leachman was a contestant on the seventh season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, paired with Corky Ballas, the oldest of the professionals and father of two-time champion Mark Ballas. Leachman is the oldest person to have competed on the show to date. She placed seventh in the competition. After &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; she guest starred on Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Girl Meets World&quot; (2015), the Christian movie &quot;I Can Only Imagine&quot; (2018). Leachman made guest roles in the NBC sitcom &quot;The Office&quot;, the TV Land series &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, the CBS drama &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;, and USA Network &quot;Royal Pains&quot; . During this time she portrayed a number of raunchy elderly women including &quot;Beerfest&quot; (2006), &quot;Scary Movie 4&quot; (2006), and &quot;The Wedding Ringer&quot; (2015). From 2010 to 2014, She played another grandmother, Maw Maw, the matriarch of the family on the Fox sitcom &quot;Raising Hope&quot;, for which she was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. 

One of Leachman&#x27;s final roles was as Zorya Vechernyaya, one of the &quot;old gods&quot; who represented the evening star, in season one (2019) of the Showtime series &quot;American Gods&quot;. Leachman appears in the film &quot;Not To Forget&quot; (2021) in her final role. The movie, directed by Valerio Zanoli, stars Karen Grassle and 5 Academy Award winners: Cloris Leachman, Louis Gossett Jr, Tatum O&#x27;Neal, George Chakiris, and Olympia Dukakis.

On May 14, 2006, she was awarded an honorary doctorate in fine arts from Drake University.

==Personal life==

From 1953 to 1978, Leachman was married to Hollywood impresario George Englund. Her former mother-in-law was character actress Mabel Albertson. The marriage produced four sons and one daughter: Bryan (died 1986), Morgan, Adam, Dinah, and George. Some of them are in show business. Her son Morgan played Dylan on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; for several years. The Englunds were Bel Air neighbors of Judy Garland, Sid Luft, and their children, Lorna and Joey Luft, during the early 1960s. Lorna Luft stated in her memoir &quot;Me and My Shadows: A Family Memoir&quot; that Leachman was &quot;the kind of mom I&#x27;d only seen on TV&quot;. Knowing of the turmoil at the Luft home, but never mentioning it, Leachman prepared meals for the children and made them feel welcome when they needed a place to stay.

Leachman was also a friend of Mort Sahl and Marlon Brando, whom she met while studying under Elia Kazan in the 1950s. She introduced him to her husband, who became close to Brando, as well, directing him in &quot;The Ugly American&quot; (1963) and writing a memoir about their friendship called &quot;Marlon Brando: The Way It&#x27;s Never Been Done Before&quot; (2005).

Leachman was a vegetarian and an animal rights activist. In 1997, she appeared on the cover of &quot;Alternative Medicine Digest&quot;, posing nude while body-painted with images of fruit in a parody of Demi Moore&#x27;s 1991 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; cover photo. She also posed clad in a dress made of lettuce for a 2009 PETA advertisement. In 2013, she starred in a comedic PETA ad on spay and neuter in which she opened a condom wrapper with her teeth. Leachman&#x27;s granddaughter, Anabel Englund, is a singer. In addition to Anabel, Leachman had other grandchildren, and one great-grandson, Braden. Leachman was an atheist.

Leachman&#x27;s manager, Juliet Green, confirmed to &quot;People&quot; magazine that she had died on January 27, 2021. Leachman&#x27;s son also confirmed this date to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. However, some sources cited a death date of January 26. Her body was cremated on February 7, 2021.

<text>Quercus laevis, the turkey oak, is a member of the red oak group of oaks. It is native to the southeastern United States. The name turkey oak derives from the resemblance of the leaves to a turkey&#x27;s foot. A Turkish and southern European species &quot;Quercus cerris&quot; is also commonly referred to as Turkey oak, so &quot;Quercus laevis&quot; is sometimes referred to as American turkey oak to distinguish it from the European species.

== Description ==
&quot;Quercus laevis&quot; is a small tree, sometimes shrubby, typically only tall, though occasionally reaching . The leaves are variable in size, mostly long but occasionally just or as much as long. They have 3–7 slender lobes, deeply incised between the lobes, each lobe with 1–3 bristle teeth at the tip. The leaves turn red in Autumn. The acorns are about long, and, like other red oaks, take 18 months to mature.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Turkey oak occurs on the coastal plain from Virginia south to southwestern Florida, and west to southeast Louisiana, where it mingles with many tropical trees such as mature coconut palms and large Cuban Laurel (&quot;Ficus&quot;) trees.

It typically grows on poor, thin, dry, rocky or sandy soils where few other oaks other than blackjack oak (&quot;Q. marilandica&quot;) can thrive. It does not have the beautiful crown form of many oaks, but is nonetheless a valuable tree for growing on infertile, dry, sandy sites. The deeply lobed leaves are also attractive. It associates as an understory tree with longleaf pine and other pine stands on sandy knolls in the southeastern United States.

<text>The Deutsche Eishockey Liga (for sponsorship reasons called [[Penny (supermarket)|PENNY]] Deutsche Eishockey Liga) (; English: &quot;German Ice Hockey League&quot;) or DEL, is a German professional ice hockey league and the highest division in German ice hockey. Founded in 1994, it was formed as a replacement for the Eishockey-Bundesliga and became the new top-tier league in Germany as a result. Unlike the old Bundesliga, the DEL is not under the administration of the German Ice Hockey Federation.

Teams from the DEL participate in the IIHF&#x27;s annual Champions Hockey League (CHL), competing for the European Trophy. Participation is based on the strength of the various leagues in Europe (excluding the European/Asian Kontinental Hockey League). Going into the 2022–23 CHL season, the DEL was ranked the No. 3 league in Europe, allowing them to send their top four teams to compete in the CHL.

In the 2016–17 season, the league was the second-best supported ice hockey league in Europe, behind the Swiss National League A, with an average attendance of 6,198 spectators per game. Fourteen different teams comprise the league, playing their home games in a diverse mix of venues, including a few large, modern arenas (e.g. in Berlin, Mannheim, Cologne, and Düsseldorf) and older, smaller venues (e.g. in Iserlohn, Schwenningen and Straubing). Kölner Haie (English: Cologne Sharks), Düsseldorfer EG, and Eisbären Berlin (Berlin Polar Bears) all regularly attract over 15,000 fans for home games. Adler Mannheim (Mannheim Eagles) also regularly attract over 12,000 fans per home game with each of their home games in the 2019 DEL Playoffs, including all three games in the final series against EHC Red Bull München, selling out. Despite attracting some of the biggest crowds in the DEL, and hosting NHL teams in preseason games, Kölner Haie have not won a championship since 2002.

In the DEL Winter Game, similar to the NHL Winter Classic where matches are played in larger outdoor venues, Cologne and Düsseldorf have played in front of crowds in excess of 40,000, notably in 2019 as Düsseldorf won in overtime in rival Cologne&#x27;s RheinEnergieStadion. The DEL Winter Game traditionally takes place every two years; four editions have been played since 2013, including games in Cologne and at the home of TSG Hoffenheim, with each attracting over 30,000 spectators. Following a 2021 postponement due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the DEL Winter Game returned in December 2022 with Cologne hosting Mannheim in the RheinEnergieStadion.

The DEL is known for its game-day atmosphere, as well as producing NHL talents including Dominik Kahun, Tim Stutzle and Lukas Reichel. Many of the German national team that took silver at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang played in the DEL, while EHC Red Bull München became the first German team to reach the Champions Hockey League final in 2019, losing to the Swedish team Frölunda HC. EHC Red Bull München followed this up by reaching the semi-finals in the 2021-22 Champions Hockey League. Ice hockey is growing as a sport in Germany and is seen as a popular alternative to football or handball, building upon the Olympic success in 2018.

A new system of promotion and relegation with the DEL2 began with the 2021–22 season, in which the last-placed DEL club will be replaced by the DEL2 champions. SC Bietigheim Steelers joined the DEL for the 2021-22 DEL season as DEL2 champions ahead of the first promotion/relegation to DEL2. Following the conclusion of the 2021–22 season, Bietigheim retained their place in the top flight while Krefeld Pinguine were relegated after finishing bottom of the table. Löwen Frankfurt (Frankfurt Lions) were promoted as DEL2 champions for the 2022–23 season.

The DEL Playoffs decide the season champions using a format akin to that of the NHL. Each team plays 52 regular-season games to determine the regular-season champions before the top 10 teams are seeded and qualify for the playoffs. The top 6 teams receive a bye to the quarter-finals while the teams ranked 7–10 compete in the pre-playoff (wildcard) round. The seedings are re-calculated after each round in a straight knockout system. The DEL Finals, held in late April or early May, is a best-of-7 games format, similar to the NHL where the top seed remaining holds home-ice advantage in a Game 7 scenario.

For the 2021–22 season and 2020–21 season, a shortened version of the DEL playoffs was used in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Eisbären Berlin won the 2022 Finals against EHC Red Bull München 3-1 in a best-of-5 format. Berlin also won the title in 2021, defeating Wolfsburg 2-1 in a best-of-3 series following a North/South regional league split during the 2020/21 season due to the pandemic.

The Eisbären Berlin and Adler Mannheim are the most successful DEL clubs and have won the last three editions between them (Mannheim 2019, Berlin 2021 &amp; 2022). Mannheim have enjoyed a lot of success in recent years (2015 and 2019 Champions, 2021 Regular Season Champions) although EHC Red Bull München won three consecutive titles between 2016 and 2018 and also made the 2019 final, losing to Mannheim in five games. München were also top of the 2020 standings before the season was curtailed. ERC Ingolstadt (2014 Champions as the 9th seed) and Grizzlys Wolfsburg (2021 runners-up) have also enjoyed deep playoff runs in the last decade.

Some of the league&#x27;s biggest rivalries include Kölner Haie and Düsseldorfer EG, Kölner Haie and Adler Mannheim, and Eisbären Berlin and EHC Red Bull München. The Bavarian Derbies between München, ERC Ingolstadt, Augsburger Panther, Straubing Tigers, and Nürnberg Ice Tigers are also fiercely contested. Due to geography, Nürnberg/Straubing and Augsburg/Ingolstadt are notable rivalries although Munich/Augsburg has become a stronger rivalry following their epic 2019 semi-final series. München won that series in the deciding game 7 which also included the longest match in DEL history, won by Augsburger Panther after 104 minutes of action in game 3, as two matches required three overtimes to determine a winner.

==History==

The Eishockey-Bundesliga was formed in 1957 as the elite hockey competition in the Federal Republic of Germany, replacing the &quot;Oberliga&quot; in this position. It was in turn replaced by the Deutsche Eishockey Liga, which now also carries the name 1st Bundesliga in its logo.

The DEL was founded in the 1994–95 season, consisting of teams from the Eishockey-Bundesliga&#x27;s 1st and 2nd divisions. The condition of these earlier leagues had become intolerable. Many 1st and 2nd division teams were heavily in debt. The 2nd division attracted few sponsors and spectators. As a result, many clubs were forced to fold or withdraw to the lower leagues. Fans and corporate sponsors focused on the 1st Bundesliga teams, forcing the elite teams to invest heavily in players to avoid relegation. This increased budgets 25 percent over the previous two years.

In the final Bundesliga season, 1993–94, only 11 teams wanted to play in the &quot;2nd Bundesliga&quot;. Furthermore, two teams folded during and after the season. Ice hockey&#x27;s reputation in Germany was heavily tarnished. This made it difficult to attract serious sponsorship. In January 1994, 20 out of the remaining 21 1st and 2nd Bundesliga teams voted for creating a new entity, the DEL.

Upon founding, the &quot;DEL Betriebsgesellschaft mbH&quot; was the first German professional sports league managed by an organization whose members were incorporated as well. The goal behind the DEL was to create a league, based on the model of the North American NHL, in which teams could play consistently without relegation concerns and create a stable league. Clubs in the DEL were required to conform to rules, which were designed to ensure long-term viability. Twelve clubs from the old &quot;1st Bundesliga&quot;, and six from the &quot;2nd Bundesliga&quot; came together as founding members. The new league immediately attracted corporate sponsorship with the Krombacher Brewery, which was prominently featured on the new league logo.

The hope of avoiding the troubles of the old &quot;Bundesliga&quot; by stricter financial controls did not materialize. During DEL&#x27;s initial season, on 18 December 1994, the &quot;Bundesliga&#x27;s&quot; final champion, the renamed &quot;EC Hedos München&quot;, folded. This was controversial, as DEL&#x27;s president Franz Hofherr had approved their license and certified their finances. Hofherr was Mad Dogs former president and it was alleged that he must have known about their desperate financial situation.

The Bosman ruling, a 1995 decision of the European Court of Justice regarding the movement of labor in soccer, had profound influence on the league. The old Bundesliga had national character with German clubs competing for the German title using mostly German players. After the ruling European Union players were excluded from the &quot;foreign&quot; player quota. In the 1995–96 season following the decision, the DEL teams employed 97 EU players. This lowered costs significantly, enabling smaller teams to compete more effectively. However, frequent player moves were not viewed positively by the fans, resulting in smaller attendance numbers.

Following an agreement with the DEB the league renamed itself as &quot;DEL – Die 1. Bundesliga&quot; in the 1999–2000 season, while reintroducing relegation and promotion to/from the 2nd Ice Hockey Bundesliga.

The 2004–05 season was significant due to the NHL lockout. 26 NHL players came to play the season in the DEL, including Jamie Langenbrunner, Erik Cole, Stéphane Robidas, Doug Weight, Mike York and several German national team players – Jochen Hecht, Olaf Kölzig, and Marco Sturm.

==League regulations==
The DEL is an independently run league, fully owned and operated by its 14 member teams. Each team must fulfill the &quot;DEL&#x27;s&quot; basic requirements to remain in the league:
* A written application for membership;
* &quot;On ice qualification&quot; for new teams (championship in the 2nd Bundesliga);
* A stadium that meets DEL standards;
* Financial qualification;
* Formation of an ordinary company (the DEL consists of franchises);
* Development program for young players; and
* Purchase of a license (currently, the licensing fee is set at €800,000.00)

The DEL can only admit one 2nd Bundesliga team per season to the league, unless the league strength falls below fourteen, in which case two clubs can be admitted. Since the 2006–07 season, no DEL team can be automatically relegated, a team can only lose its league status through non-compliance with the leagues regulations (see above).

The &quot;ESBG&quot; guarantees to admit any DEL team wishing to step down to the lower 2nd Bundesliga or Oberliga. The team, however, has to purchase a license (licensing fees for the 2nd Bundesliga are currently set at €100,000.00).

To regulate the relationship between the DEL, the &quot;DEB&quot; and the &quot;ESBG&quot; (2nd Bundesliga), a so-called &quot;Kooperationsvertrag&quot; exists. This &quot;cooperation contract&quot; was signed in December 2005, and was valid until 2011. This contract ended years of dispute between the three organizations over competencies and financial issues.

In November 2007, the DEL announced another change in policy. The league expanded to allow 16 teams beginning in the 2008–09 season, resulting in direct promotion for the 2nd Bundesliga league champions, should they fulfill all requirements and be interested in joining the DEL. Should this not be the case, or a current DEL team resigns from the league, a selection process would determine the club, or clubs, who would be eligible to join in order required to achieve 16 teams. &quot;(Note: Füchse Duisburg resigned before the 2009–10 season and was not replaced until the following season.)&quot;

For that season, it was also mandated that each DEL club would be allowed to have no more than ten non-EC players under contract.

Additionally, a new format for the game schedule will limit the number of regular-season games to 52 for each team. This is achieved by each team playing four games against eleven others and two games against the remaining four. To determine which teams play, the final standings of the previous season are used.

The DEL would also reintroduce promotion once more. The first- and second-lowest ranked teams will play a best-of-seven series to determine which team faces the 2nd Bundesliga champion for a place in the league. There is, however, an ongoing dispute about those games as second division teams may only have five foreign players on contract and therefore face a handicap in comparison to the DEL teams with twelve import players each. For now, the &quot;ESBG&quot; has declared that no team from the 2nd Bundesliga would take part in these matches and therefore no promotion/relegation with the DEL will take place.

<text>In crystallography, the orthorhombic crystal system is one of the 7 crystal systems. Orthorhombic lattices result from stretching a cubic lattice along two of its orthogonal pairs by two different factors, resulting in a rectangular prism with a rectangular base (&quot;a&quot; by &quot;b&quot;) and height (&quot;c&quot;), such that &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are distinct. All three bases intersect at 90° angles, so the three lattice vectors remain mutually orthogonal.

==Bravais lattices==
There are four orthorhombic Bravais lattices: primitive orthorhombic, base-centered orthorhombic, body-centered orthorhombic, and face-centered orthorhombic.

For the base-centered orthorhombic lattice, the primitive cell has the shape of a right rhombic prism; it can be constructed because the two-dimensional centered rectangular base layer can also be described with primitive rhombic axes. Note that the length formula_1 of the primitive cell below equals formula_2 of the conventional cell above.

==Crystal classes==

The &quot;orthorhombic crystal system&quot; class names, examples, Schönflies notation, Hermann-Mauguin notation, point groups, International Tables for Crystallography space group number, orbifold notation, type, and space groups are listed in the table below.

== In two dimensions ==

In two dimensions there are two orthorhombic Bravais lattices: primitive rectangular and centered rectangular.

<doc id="521832" wikidata="Q5255702" url="?curid=521832" title="Democratic Party (UK, 1998)">
<text>The Democratic Party was a political party active in the United Kingdom between 1998 and 2005, although not officially deregistered until 2010.

It was founded in November 1998 by Malvern businessman Geoff Southall, who also funded the party. It was described as &quot;right wing&quot; or &quot;hard right&quot; in news reports, but claimed to occupy the centre-ground of British politics. It aimed to reduce Britain&#x27;s involvement with the European Union, opposed the adoption of the euro, called for direct democracy, and argued for limits on immigration. The party&#x27;s slogan was &quot;The will of the people NOT the party&quot;. It had a few hundred members in 1999, including previous supporters of James Goldsmith&#x27;s Referendum Party.

Charles Beauclerk, Earl of Burford, stood as its candidate in the November 1999 Kensington and Chelsea by-election against Michael Portillo, receiving 189 votes (0.9%). The party decided not to stand any candidates in the 2001 general election, citing a lack of media attention. It criticised the United Kingdom Independence Party in 2000 for being perceived as right-wing, lacking political acumen, and performing poorly in Westminster elections. In 2003, the party took legal action against the UK government in the High Court over the then-proposed EU Constitution.

Until 2001 the party&#x27;s Home and Legal Affairs spokesman was Alan Kilshaw, who resigned when he and his then wife became involved in an adoption scandal.

Other than in seeking legal advice, the party was inactive after 2005 at the latest, and received no income in 2008 or 2009. According to the Electoral Commission the party was &#x27;de-registered voluntarily&#x27; in June 2010.

<text>Alfred Wallis (18 August 1855 – 29 August 1942) was a British artist and fisherman, known for his port landscapes and shipping scenes painted in a naïve style. Having no artistic training, he began painting at the age of 70, using household paint on scraps of cardboard. He achieved little commercial success, although his work was championed by progressive artists such as Ben Nicholson and Christopher Wood.

==Life and work==
Alfred&#x27;s parents, Charles and Jane Wallis, were from Penzance in Cornwall, and moved to Devonport, Plymouth, in 1850, to find work. Alfred and his brother Charles were born in Devonport. Later, when Jane Wallis died, the family returned to Penzance. Upon leaving school, Alfred was apprenticed to a basketmaker before becoming a mariner in the merchant service by the early 1870s. He sailed on schooners across the North Atlantic between Penzance and Newfoundland.

Wallis married Susan Ward in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Penzance, in 1876, when he was 20 and his wife was 41. He became stepfather to her five children. He continued as a deep-sea fisherman on the Newfoundland run in the early days of his marriage, which allowed him to earn a good wage. After the death of his two infant children Alfred switched to local fishing and labouring in Penzance.

The family moved to St Ives, Cornwall, in 1890 where he established himself as a marine stores dealer, buying scrap iron, sails, rope and other items. In 1912, his business, &quot;Wallis, Alfred, Marine Stores Dealer&quot; closed and Alfred kept busy with odd jobs and worked for a local antiques dealer, Mr Armour, which provided some insight into the world of objets d&#x27;art.

Following his wife&#x27;s death in 1922, Wallis took up painting, as he later told Jim Ede, &quot;for company&quot;. He was self-taught, and never had an art lesson.

His paintings are an excellent example of naïve art; perspective is ignored and an object&#x27;s scale is often based on its relative importance in the scene, giving many of his paintings a resemblance to early maps. Wallis painted seascapes from memory, in large part because the world of sail he knew was being replaced by steamships. As he put it, his subjects were &quot;what use To Bee out of my memory what we may never see again ...&quot; Having little money, Wallis used what materials were immediately available, mostly painting on cardboard torn from packing boxes and using a limited palette of paint bought from ship chandlers.

By fortunate coincidence, in 1928, a few years after he had started painting, Ben Nicholson and Christopher Wood came to St Ives and established an artist colony. They were delighted to find Wallis and celebrated his direct approach to image-making. Nicholson commented later that &quot;to Wallis, his paintings were never &#x27;paintings&#x27; but actual events&quot;. Wallis was propelled into a circle of some of the most progressive artists working in Britain in the 1930s.

The influence, however, was all one way; Wallis continued to paint as he always had. Nicholson later termed Wallis&#x27;s art &quot;something that has grown out of the Cornish seas and earth and which will endure&quot;.

Through Nicholson and Wood, Wallis was introduced to Jim Ede who promoted his work in London. Despite this attention, Wallis sold few paintings and continued to live in poverty until he died in the Madron workhouse near Penzance. He is buried in Barnoon cemetery, overlooking St Ives Porthmeor beach and the Tate St Ives gallery. An elaborate gravestone, made from tiles by the potter Bernard Leach and depicting a tiny mariner at the foot of a huge lighthouse – a popular motif in Wallis&#x27;s paintings – covers the tomb.

Wallis thought his neighbours resented his fame, and that they believed him to be secretly rich. In one of his last letters, to Ede, he wrote:

Examples of Wallis&#x27;s paintings can be seen at the Tate St Ives and at Kettle&#x27;s Yard in Cambridge (Jim Ede&#x27;s home). In October 2020, an exhibition titled &quot;Alfred Wallis Rediscovered&quot; opened at Kettle&#x27;s Yard.

<doc id="521836" wikidata="Q2660268" url="?curid=521836" title="Ceratiola">
<text>Ceratiola is a genus of flowering plants with a single species, Ceratiola ericoides, a shrub endemic to the Southeastern United States.

==Names==
&quot;C. ericoides&quot; is commonly known as Florida rosemary, sand heath, scrub rosemary, or sandhill rosemary.

== Description ==
Florida rosemary can grow to tall. The growth form is a rounded shrub with dense branching. Dark green leaves are needle-like, eight to twelve mm long and one mm wide, and smell like the herb rosemary. The yellow to brown flowers are small. The green or yellow fruit is in diameter, and is a juicy drupe containing two seeds.

=== Reproduction ===
The Florida rosemary is dioecious and wind pollinated. Flowers are in the leaf axils on the previous years growth. Flowers bloom on leaf axils of the previous year&#x27;s growth from September through October. Fruits ripen in January through April. Flowers and fruit may remain on the plant year-round. Plants do not produce seed until they are 10 to 15 years old. Seed production per plant increases until age 20 to 30 years. Seed production begins to fall off in plants more than 35 years old.

Florida rosemary plants release a chemical called ceratiolin into the soil, which breaks down into hydrocinnamic acid, which in turn inhibits the growth of other plants, and of rosemary seeds (a process called allelopathy). Decomposition by microbiota, fire, and other disturbances to the soil break down the hydrocinnamic acid, allowing other plants to grow, and rosemary seeds to sprout.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Ceratiola ericoides&quot; is the sole species in the genus &quot;Ceratiola&quot;. It was formerly included in the plant family Empetraceae, which since 2002 has been reclassified as the tribe Empetreae in the Ericoideae subfamily of the Ericaceae family.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The species is native to subtropical scrub and dry sandy habitats on the Atlantic Coastal Plain in the southeastern United States, including Georgia and South Carolina, throughout Florida, and in coastal counties of Alabama and Mississippi. It commonly occurs in Florida scrubs together with sand pine and evergreen scrub oaks.

== Ecology ==
The fruit and seeds are consumed primarily by the Florida harvester ant, the oldfield mouse, the eastern towhee, and the Florida scrub jay. Seeds eaten by ants and mice are destroyed, while those in fruits eaten by birds pass through the birds&#x27; digestive tracts unharmed. Seeds in soil lose viability in less than 10 years.

Florida scrub communities typically experience fires at 15 to 100 year intervals, which kill all plants, including rosemary. If a scrub patch burns less than ten years after a previous fire, there will not be seeds available in the soil to sprout into new rosemary plants. Johnson suggests that the falloff in seed production after a plant passes 35 years in age indicates that fires usually occur no more than 40 years after a previous fire, so that there is no selective pressure to continue producing large seed crops past 40 years.

<doc id="521837" wikidata="Q1592959" url="?curid=521837" title="Hecke operator">
<text>In mathematics, in particular in the theory of modular forms, a Hecke operator, studied by , is a certain kind of &quot;averaging&quot; operator that plays a significant role in the structure of vector spaces of modular forms and more general automorphic representations.

== History ==

 used Hecke operators on modular forms in a paper on the special cusp form of Ramanujan, ahead of the general theory given by . Mordell proved that the Ramanujan tau function, expressing the coefficients of the Ramanujan form,

: formula_1

is a multiplicative function:

: formula_2

The idea goes back to earlier work of Adolf Hurwitz, who treated algebraic correspondences between modular curves which realise some individual Hecke operators.

== Mathematical description ==

Hecke operators can be realized in a number of contexts. The simplest meaning is combinatorial, namely as taking for a given integer some function defined on the lattices of fixed rank to

:formula_3

with the sum taken over all the that are subgroups of of index . For example, with and two dimensions, there are three such . Modular forms are particular kinds of functions of a lattice, subject to conditions making them analytic functions and homogeneous with respect to homotheties, as well as moderate growth at infinity; these conditions are preserved by the summation, and so Hecke operators preserve the space of modular forms of a given weight.

Another way to express Hecke operators is by means of double cosets in the modular group. In the contemporary adelic approach, this translates to double cosets with respect to some compact subgroups.

=== Explicit formula ===

Let be the set of integral matrices with determinant and be the full modular group . Given a modular form of weight , the th Hecke operator acts by the formula

: formula_4

where is in the upper half-plane and the normalization constant assures that the image of a form with integer Fourier coefficients has integer Fourier coefficients. This can be rewritten in the form

: formula_5

which leads to the formula for the Fourier coefficients of in terms of the Fourier coefficients of :

: formula_6

One can see from this explicit formula that Hecke operators with different indices commute and that if then , so the subspace of cusp forms of weight is preserved by the Hecke operators. If a (non-zero) cusp form is a simultaneous eigenform of all Hecke operators with eigenvalues then and . Hecke eigenforms are normalized so that , then

: formula_7

Thus for normalized cuspidal Hecke eigenforms of integer weight, their Fourier coefficients coincide with their Hecke eigenvalues.

== Hecke algebras ==

Algebras of Hecke operators are called &quot;Hecke algebras&quot;, and are commutative rings. In the classical elliptic modular form theory, the Hecke operators with coprime to the level acting on the space of cusp forms of a given weight are self-adjoint with respect to the Petersson inner product. Therefore, the spectral theorem implies that there is a basis of modular forms that are eigenfunctions for these Hecke operators. Each of these basic forms possesses an Euler product. More precisely, its Mellin transform is the Dirichlet series that has Euler products with the local factor for each prime is the inverse of the Hecke polynomial, a quadratic polynomial in . In the case treated by Mordell, the space of cusp forms of weight 12 with respect to the full modular group is one-dimensional. It follows that the Ramanujan form has an Euler product and establishes the multiplicativity of .

Other related mathematical rings are also called &quot;Hecke algebras&quot;, although sometimes the link to Hecke operators is not entirely obvious. These algebras include certain quotients of the group algebras of braid groups. The presence of this commutative operator algebra plays a significant role in the harmonic analysis of modular forms and generalisations.

<doc id="521840" wikidata="Q1849843" url="?curid=521840" title="Xavier University">
<text>Xavier University ( ) is a private Jesuit university in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. It is the sixth-oldest Catholic and fourth-oldest Jesuit university in the United States. Xavier had an enrollment of approximately 5,600 undergraduate and graduate students as of 2024. The school&#x27;s system comprises the main campus in Cincinnati, as well as regional locations for its accelerated nursing program in Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio.

Xavier University is primarily an undergraduate, liberal arts institution. It provides an education in the Jesuit tradition, which emphasizes learning through community service, interdisciplinary courses and the engagement of faith, theology, philosophy and ethics studies. Xavier&#x27;s athletic teams, known as the Xavier Musketeers, compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level in the Big East Conference.

==History==

Xavier University is the fourth oldest Jesuit University and the sixth oldest Catholic university in the United States. The school was founded in 1831 as a men&#x27;s college in downtown Cincinnati next to St. Francis Xavier Church on Sycamore Street. The Athenaeum, as it was then called, was dedicated to the patronage of Saint Francis Xavier by Bishop Edward Fenwick on October 17, 1831. Upon Bishop John Baptist Purcell&#x27;s request, the Society of Jesus took control of The Athenaeum in 1840, and the name was changed to St. Xavier College in honor of the 16th century Spanish Jesuit missionary, St. Francis Xavier who, like the founder of the Jesuits, Ignatius Loyola, was a Spanish Navarrese.

St. Xavier College moved in 1912 to its current Evanston location, about north of downtown Cincinnati, after the purchase of from the Avondale Athletic Club. The &quot;original&quot; Anthenaeum is now the seminary of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. St. Xavier College and St. Xavier High School officially split in 1919, though they did not become financially independent until 1934.

Xavier sponsors eight intercollegiate sports for men, and eight sports for women. The university&#x27;s graduation rate of 94% is the third highest graduation rate for athletes in the nation behind Duke University and Stanford University. Xavier sports teams have several traditional rivalries with local universities, including the University of Cincinnati and the Villanova University.

Xavier was a founding member of the Midwestern City Conference in 1979. Renamed the Midwestern Collegiate Conference in 1985, it is now known as the Horizon League. Xavier was a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference from 1995 to 2013 where it enjoyed many successful basketball seasons. On March 20, 2013, the Xavier administration announced that the school will join the newly created Big East following the realignment of the old Big East Conference, and moved to the new conference July 1, 2013.

The basketball and volleyball teams play in the 10,250-seat Cintas Center on campus which opened in 2000.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===

The Xavier men&#x27;s basketball team is perhaps the best known of the sports sponsored at Xavier. The team has enjoyed considerable recent success, reaching the Elite Eight in the NCAA Tournament in 2004, 2008, and 2017. Since 1985, every men&#x27;s basketball player who has played as a senior has graduated with a degree. During the era of college football&#x27;s now-defunct Bowl Championship Series, Xavier was one of only two schools outside the main BCS conferences (a group now known as the Power Five) to be listed among the top 20 most valuable programs in college basketball (the other being UNLV) according to Forbes.

===Football===

Xavier fielded an NCAA Division I football team until the 1973 season.

===Baseball===

The Xavier baseball team won the 2014 Big East Championship and participated in the Nashville Regional. The 2009 Xavier Baseball team won the Atlantic 10 tournament and participated in the Houston Regional. The Xavier baseball won the 2023 Big East Championship and participated in the Nashville Regional.

The Xavier men&#x27;s swim team overall has captured the Big East Title in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020, and 2021 making it their second three peat and sixth championship in their eight years since joining the conference in 2013.

===Club sports===
The club sports program is designed to serve the interests of Xavier University students, faculty, and staff in different sports and recreational activities. These interests may be competitive, recreational, and/or instructional in nature.

In 2017 the Xavier Men&#x27;s Rugby Club team made it the Final Four in Denver Colorado for the National Small College Rugby Championship. Xavier finished 3rd in the country at the Tournament and was ranked 3rd in the Country that year. The Xavier Rugby Club has been ranked in the Top 20 of the National Collegiate Rugby Conference 7 out of the last 8 years. The Volley Ball team The Xavier Men&#x27;s Volleyball Club Team took home 2nd place at Nationals in April 2019.In 2022, the Xavier Men&#x27;s Volleyball Club Team won the national championship.

===Mascots===
Xavier is one of a handful of universities with two mascots. D&#x27;Artagnan, the Musketeer, is the university&#x27;s official mascot and is the origin of the school&#x27;s nickname, The Xavier Musketeers. The Musketeer concept was suggested in 1925 by the late Reverend Francis J. Finn, S.J.

The Blue Blob came about in 1985 when the spirit squad coordinators realized that a more audience-friendly mascot was needed. The musketeer mascot, who sported a handlebar mustache and a prop sword, scared younger spectators. The Blue Blob is a furry creature that has made several television and magazine appearances over the years, including a controversial PlayBoy appearance. The Blue Blob has Bobble-Body dolls, Plush replicas, and T-shirts made in his likeness, and an annual Blue Blob Appreciation Night during the Musketeer&#x27;s basketball season. He most recently appeared on two ESPN &quot;This is SportsCenter&quot; commercials with Pro Football Hall of Fame member Jim Kelly and SportsCenter anchors Scott Van Pelt and John Anderson.

===Media===
Most Xavier games can be heard on WLW or WKRC-AM. Joe Sunderman does the play-by-play and Byron Larkin does color commentary for most games. Fox Sports Net Ohio holds the local television rights to the Musketeers basketball games. Brad Johansen does play-by-play and Steve Wolf is the analyst. Over the air stations, WCPO-TV and WSTR-TV have held the rights to Xavier games in the past.

==Faith and service==
The Dorothy Day Center for Faith and Justice is an important part of Xavier University&#x27;s mission to form men and women for others.

===Student programs===
At the beginning of freshman year, the center gives students opportunities to form community among themselves, with an effort at inclusiveness across all lines of faith and culture. They are then encouraged to join the other students in choosing from a variety of service opportunities.

Students can pursue community service through the following programs: work in the Nexus community garden, weekly service with organizations in the Cincinnati area through the X-CHANGE program, Community Action Day when the whole XU community and alumni are encouraged to give a day of service to the larger community, a monthly service opportunity at St. Francis Seraph Soup Kitchen, and Alternative Breaks offering opportunities to serve in the United States and abroad during fall and spring breaks. A total of 25 immersion trips are offered. It is estimated that students perform more than 60,000 service hours in a year.

Most programs include reflection components and the following programs facilitated by the center are also staged to provoke reflection: Ignatian Family Teach-In for Justice, Stories of Solidarity, Jesuit Martyrs of El Salvador commemoration, and Contemplatives in Action.

More intensive service experiences include the following:
*Summer Service Internship allows 20 students to live on campus while being paid for working at an area non-profit.
*Graduate Internship employs graduates to work along with the CFJ staff.
* is the center&#x27;s listing of non-profit internships nationwide. This is supplemented by Idealist.org which includes also international listings. Sponsors of internships include Scripps Howard Foundation, the Catholic Archdiocese, the Catholic Campaign for Human Development, and Community Shares.
*GetAway for First Year Students, with opportunities to organize and make spiritual retreats.
*Graduate School and Year-of-Service Fair introduces students to over 50 options for a year of service after graduation, at home and abroad. Some of the more popular are Peace Corps, Jesuit Volunteer Corps, Public Allies, and Americorps. Long listings of possibilities are on websites hosted by Stanford, Notre Dame, Service Leader, and Volunteer.gov.

== Student newspaper ==
The Xavier Newswire is an independent student newspaper published weekly during the academic year by the students of Xavier University.

The Publications House, which previous housed the editing team, was demolished on March 10, 2010, and the staff ever since meets in the Gallagher Student Center on campus.
