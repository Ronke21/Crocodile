<text>Goodison Park is a football stadium in Walton, Liverpool, England, that has been the home of Premier League club Everton since 1892. It is 2 miles (3 km) north of the city centre, and has an all-seated capacity of 39,414.

Goodison Park has hosted more top-flight games than any other stadium in England. It has also been the venue for an FA Cup Final and numerous international fixtures, including a semi-final match in the 1966 World Cup.

Initially, Everton planned to relocate to Everton Stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock in 2024, but the club now has decided to leave its home at the end of the 2024–25 season, after which Goodison Park will be demolished and the site redeveloped.

==History==

===Before Goodison Park===
Everton originally played on an open pitch in the south-east corner of the newly laid out Stanley Park (on a site where rival Liverpool FC considered building a stadium over a century later). The first official match following the renaming of the club from &quot;St. Domingo&#x27;s&quot; to &quot;Everton&quot; was at Stanley Park, staged on 20 December 1879; St. Peter&#x27;s was the opposition, and admission was free. In 1882, a man named J. Cruit donated land at Priory Road with the necessary facilities required for professional clubs, but asked the club to leave his land after two years because the crowds became too large and noisy.

Everton moved to nearby Anfield Road, a site where proper covered stands were built. Everton played at the Anfield ground from 1884 until 1892. During this time the club turned professional entering teams in the FA Cup. They became founding members of the Football League winning their first championship at the ground in 1890–91. Anfield&#x27;s capacity grew to over 20,000 with the club hosted an international match with England hosting Ireland. During their time at Anfield, Everton became the first club to introduce goalnets to professional football.

In the 1890s, a dispute about how the club was to be owned and run emerged with John Houlding, Anfield&#x27;s majority owner and Everton&#x27;s Chairman, at the forefront. Houlding disagreed with the club&#x27;s committee initially disagreeing about the full purchase of the land at Anfield from minor land owner Mr Orrell escalating into a principled disagreement of how the club was run. Two such disagreements included Houlding wanting Everton to sell only his brewery products during an event and for the Everton players to use his public house &quot;The Sandon&quot; as changing room facilities.

The most well-known of the disagreements concerns the level of increased rent Everton was asked to pay. In 1889, Everton paid £100 to Houlding in rent; by the 1889–90 season this had risen to £250. Everton had to pay for all works and stands. The dispute escalated to a rent of £370 per year being demanded. In the complicated lead-up to the split in the club, the rent dispute is too simplistic to be singled out as the prime cause. The dispute was compounded by many minor disputed points.

The flashpoint was a covenant in the contract of land purchase by Houlding from Orrell causing further and deep friction. A strip of land at the Anfield ground bordering the adjacent land owned by Mr Orrell, could be used to provide a right of way access road for Orrell&#x27;s landlocked vacant site. In early 1891 the club erected a stand on this now proposed roadway, which was also overlapping Orrell&#x27;s land, unbeknown to the Everton F.C. Committee. In August 1891 Orrell announced intentions of developing his land next to the football ground, building an access road on the land owned by Houlding and occupied by Everton F.C.

Everton F.C. stated it knew nothing of the covenant; Houlding stated it did. This situation created great distrust, leading to friction between Houlding and the Everton F.C. Committee. The rift and distrust between the two parties was on three levels: Houlding&#x27;s personal business intentions, politically and morally. Nevertheless, the club faced a dilemma of having to destroy the new revenue generating stand or compensate Orrell.

Houlding&#x27;s way around the problem was to propose a limited company with floatation of the club enabling the club to purchase Houlding&#x27;s and Orrell&#x27;s land outright, hoping to raise £12,000. Previous attempts to raise money from the community had failed miserably. This would have meant the club would need to find £6,000 in cash with an additional £4,875 mortgage. The Everton Committee initially accepted Houlding&#x27;s proposal in principle, yet voted against it at a meeting.

After much negotiating and brinkmanship on both sides Everton vacated Anfield, leaving Houlding with an empty stadium with no one to play in it. As a consequence, Houlding formed his own football club, Liverpool, to take up residence at the stadium.

The clubs themselves have differing versions of events of why it occurred.

===Genesis of Goodison Park===
On 15 September 1891, a general meeting took place at Royal Street Hall, near Everton Valley. Everton&#x27;s chairman John Houlding proposed that a limited company be formed with the new company purchasing his land and local brewer Joseph Orrell&#x27;s adjacent land for a combined £9,237. A club run as a limited company was unusual for the time; football clubs were usually run as &quot;sports clubs&quot; with members paying an annual fee. The proposal was supported by William Barclay, the club secretary and a close friend of Houlding.
Liberal Party politician and Everton board member George Mahon fought the proposal putting forward his own amendment which was carried by the Everton board. At the time Everton&#x27;s board contained both Conservative and Liberal Party councillors. Houlding and Mahon had previously clashed during local elections.

Both men agreed that Everton should operate as a limited company; however, they had different ideas about share ownership. Houlding suggested that 12,000 shares be created with each Everton board member given one share and the other shares sold to the public or Everton board members. Mahon disagreed and proposed that 500 shares be created with no member carrying more than 10 shares with board members given &quot;7 or 8&quot; shares. Mahon reasoned &quot;we would rather have a large number of individual applications so that there will be more supporters of the club.&quot;

A special general meeting was convened at the former Liverpool College building on Shaw Street on 25 January 1892. John Houlding&#x27;s proposal was defeated once more with George Mahon suggesting that Everton relocate to another site. A heckler shouted, &quot;You can&#x27;t find one!&quot; Mahon responded &quot;I have one in my pocket&quot; revealing an option to lease Mere Green field, in Walton, Lancashire, the site of the current Goodison Park.

The Liverpool press were partisan. The proposal was deemed to be a positive move for the club by the Liberal-leaning &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot; which described Houlding&#x27;s ousting as &quot;having shaken off the incubus.&quot; The Tory-supporting &quot;Liverpool Courier&quot; and &quot;Liverpool Evening Express&quot;—owned by Conservative MP for Everton, John A. Willox, a Trustee of the Licensed Victuallers&#x27; and Brewers&#x27; Association—took Houlding&#x27;s side. The &quot;Courier&quot; published letters regularly criticising Mahon&#x27;s supporters—many of which were anonymous. Philanthropist William Hartley, a jam manufacturer and Robert William Hudson, a prominent soap-manufacturer supported Mahon.

The stadium was named Goodison Park because the length of the site was built against Goodison Road. The road was named after a civil engineer named George Goodison who provided a sewage report to the Walton Local Board in the mid-1800s later becoming a local landowner.

The Mere Green field was owned by Christopher Leyland with Everton renting until they were in a position to buy the site outright. Initially, the field needed work as parts of the site needed excavation, the field was levelled, a drainage system was installed and turf was laid. This work was considered to be a &#x27;formidable initial expenditure&#x27; with local contractor Mr Barton contracted to work on the site at 4½d per square yard—a total cost of £552. A J. Prescott was brought in as an architectural advisor and surveyor.

Walton-based building firm Kelly Brothers were instructed to erect two uncovered stands that could each accommodate 4,000 spectators. A third covered stand accommodating 3,000 spectators was also requested. The combined cost of these stands was £1,640. Everton inserted a penalty clause into the contract in case the work was not completed by its 31 July deadline. Everton officials were impressed with the builder&#x27;s workmanship agreeing two further contracts: exterior hoardings were constructed at a cost of £150 with 12 turnstiles installed at a cost of £7 each. In 1894, Benjamin Kelly of Kelly Brothers was appointed as a director of Everton.

Dr. James Baxter of the Everton committee donated a £1,000 interest-free loan to build Goodison Park. The stadium was England&#x27;s first purpose-built football ground, with stands on three sides. Goodison Park was officially opened on 24 August 1892 by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the Football Association. No football was played; instead the 12,000 crowd watched a short athletics event followed by music and a fireworks display. Upon its completion the stadium was the first joint purpose-built football stadium in the world; Celtic&#x27;s basic Celtic Park ground in Glasgow, Scotland was inaugurated on the same day as Goodison Park.
The first football match at Goodison Park was on 2 September 1892 between Everton and Bolton Wanderers. Everton wore its new club colours of salmon and dark blue stripes and won the exhibition game 4–2. The first league game at Goodison Park took place on 3 September 1892 against Nottingham Forest; the game ended in a 2–2 draw. The stadium&#x27;s first competitive goal was scored by Forest&#x27;s Horace Pike and the first Everton goal scored by Fred Geary. Everton&#x27;s first league victory at their new ground came in the next home game with a 6–0 defeat of Newton Heath in front of an estimated 10,000 spectators.

It was announced at a general meeting on 22 March 1895 that the club could finally afford to buy Goodison Park. Mahon revealed that Everton were buying Goodison Park for £650 less than the price of Anfield three years earlier, with Goodison Park having more land and a 25% larger capacity. The motion to purchase Goodison Park was passed unanimously. Dr. Baxter also lent the club £5,000 to redeem the mortgage early at a rate of 3½%. By this time the redrawing of political boundaries put Walton, and hence Goodison Park, inside the City of Liverpool.

In 1999, &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper journalist David Conn unexpectedly coined the nickname &quot;The Grand Old Lady&quot; for the stadium when he wrote &quot;Another potential suitor has apparently thought better of Everton, walking away on Tuesday from the sagging Grand Old Lady of English football, leaving her still in desperate need of a makeover.&quot;

===Structural developments===
The Goodison Park structure was built in stages. In the summer of 1895 a new Bullens Road stand was built and a roof placed on the original Goodison Road stand but only after five directors, including chairman, George Mahon had resigned over what was described in the club minutes as &#x27;acute administrative difficulties&#x27;. In 1906, the double-decker Goodison Avenue Stand was built behind the goal at the south end of the ground. The stand was designed by Liverpool architect Henry Hartley who went on to chair the Liverpool Architectural Society a year later. The club minutes from the time show that Hartley was unhappy with certain aspects of the stand and the poor sightlines meant that the goal line had to be moved seven metres north, towards Gwladys Street. In January 1908, he complained that his fees had not been paid and the bill for the stand was near £13,000. There were 2,657 seats on its upper tier with a terrace below.

Archibald Leitch designed the Goodison Road Stand with construction in 1909. In September that year Ernest Edwards, the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; journalist who christened the terrace at Anfield the &quot;Spion Kop&quot;, wrote of the newly built stand, &quot;The building as one looks at it, suggests the side of Mauretania at once.&quot; The stand was occasionally referred to as the &quot;Mauretania Stand&quot;, in reference to the Liverpool-registered , then the world&#x27;s largest ship, which operated from the Port of Liverpool.

The two-tier steel frame and wooden floor Bullens Road Stand, designed by Archibald Leitch, was completed in 1926. The upper tier was seated, with terracing below, a part of the ground called The Paddock. Few changes were made until 1963 when the rear of the Paddock was seated and an overhanging roof was added. The stand is known for Archibald Leitch&#x27;s highly distinctive balcony trusses which also act as handrails for the front row of seats in the Upper Bullens stand. Goodison Park is the only stadium with two complete trusses designed by Leitch. Of the 17 created, only Goodison Park, Ibrox and Fratton Park retain these trusses.

Everton constructed covered dugouts in 1931. The idea was inspired by a visit to Pittodrie to play a friendly against Aberdeen, where such dugouts had been constructed at the behest of the Dons&#x27; trainer Donald Colman. The Goodison Park dugouts were the first in England.

The ground become an entirely two-tiered affair in 1938 with another Archibald Leitch stand at the Gwladys Street end. The stand completed at a cost of £50,000, being delayed because an old man would not move from his to be demolished home. The original Gwladys Street having had terraced houses on either side, with those backing on to the ground making way for the expansion. Architect Leitch and Everton Chairman Will Cuff became close friends with Cuff appointed as Leitch&#x27;s accountant with Leitch moving to nearby Formby.

In 1940, during the Second World War, the Gwladys Street Stand suffered bomb damage. The bomb had landed directly in Gwladys Street and caused serious injury to nearby residents. The bomb splinter damage to the bricks on the stand is still noticeable. The cost of repair was £5,000 and was paid for by the War Damage Commission.

The Director&#x27;s minutes read: &quot;It was decided also that Messrs A. Leitch be instructed to value the cost of complete renewal of damaged properties and that a claim should be forwarded to the War Damage Claims department within the prescribed 30 days.

&quot;The damage referred to included the demolition of a wide section of the new stand outer wall in Gwladys St, destruction of all glass in this stand, damage to every door, canteen, water and electricity pipe and all lead fittings: perforate roof in hundreds of places.

&quot;On Bullens Road side, a bomb dropped in the school yard had badly damaged the exterior wall of this stand and the roof was badly perforated here also. A third bomb outside the practice ground had demolished the surrounding hoarding and had badly damaged glass in the Goodison Ave and Walton Lane property.&quot;

The first floodlit match at Goodison Park took place when Everton hosted Liverpool on 9 October 1957 in front of 58,771 spectators. Four pylons each with 36 lamps installed were installed behind each corner of the pitch. At the time, they were tallest in the country. There was capacity for 18 more lamps per pylon if it was felt the brightness was insufficient for the game. Each bulb was a 1,500 watt tungsten bulb 15 inches in diameter and cost 25 shillings. It was recommended that the club made a habit of changing them after three to four seasons to save the club performing intermittent repairs. MANWEB installed a transformer sub-station to cope with the 6,000 volt-load.

The first undersoil heating system in English football was installed at Goodison Park in 1958, with 20 miles (30 km) of electric wire laid beneath the playing surface at a cost of £16,000. The system was more effective than anticipated and the drainage system could not cope with the quantity of water produced from the melting of frost and snow. As a consequence the pitch had to be relaid in 1960 to allow a more suitable drainage system to be installed.

The Everton chairman Sir John Moores, who presided over the club between 1960 and 1973, provided finances for the club in the form of loans to become involved in large-scale redevelopment projects and compete with other clubs for the best players; under his stewardship Everton acquired the nickname &#x27;The Mersey Millionaires&#x27;.

Goodison Park featured in the filming of &quot;The Golden Vision&quot;, a BBC film made for television. The matches featured in the film were Division One games against Manchester City on 4 November 1967 (1–1 draw) and 18 November 1967 versus Sheffield United (1–0 win)—the scorer of the winner that day was Alex Young, also known as The Golden Vision or Golden Ghost after whom the film was named.

Everton was the first club to have a scoreboard installed in England. On 20 November 1971 Everton beat Southampton 8–0 with Joe Royle scoring four, David Johnson three and Alan Ball one. The scoreboard did not have enough room to display the goal scorer&#x27;s names and simply read &quot;7 9 7 9 8 9 9 7&quot; as it displayed the goal scorers&#x27; shirt numbers instead.

The Goodison Road Stand was partially demolished and rebuilt during the 1969–70 season with striking images of both old and new stands side by side. The new stand opened in 1971, at a cost of £1 million. The new stand housed the 500 and 300 members clubs and an escalator to the tallest stand in the ground—the Top Balcony. However, not everyone thought that the upgrade was necessary at the time. Journalist Geoffrey Green of &quot;The Times&quot; wrote &quot;Goodison Park has always been a handsome fashionable stage for football, a living thing full of atmospherics-like a theatre. And now it has stepped into the demanding seventies with a facelift it scarcely seemed to need compared with some of us I know. New giant stands in place of the old; the latest in dazzling floodlight systems that cast not a shadow. A cathedral of a place indeed, fit for the gods of the game.&quot;

The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 saw the Bullens Road Stand extensively fireproofed with widened aisles, which entailed closure of parts of the stand. Because of the closure, Anfield was chosen over first choice Goodison Park for a Wales vs. Scotland World Cup qualifying tie.

Following Moores&#x27; exit from Everton&#x27;s hierarchy, minimum changes had been made to Goodison Park&#x27;s structure due to costs, two British Government Acts; the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and Football Spectators Act 1989 had forced the club&#x27;s hand into improving the facilities. Upon Moore&#x27;s death the club was sold to Peter Johnson.

Everton legends William Ralph &#x27;Dixie&#x27; Dean and former manager Harry Catterick both died at Goodison Park. Dean suffered a heart attack, aged 73, in 1980, whilst Catterick died five years later, also suffering a heart attack, aged 65.

Everton F.C. celebrated the centenary of Goodison Park with a game against German club side Borussia Mönchengladbach in August 1992. In addition, 200 limited edition medals were created and Liverpool based author and journalist Ken Rogers wrote a book &quot;One Hundred Years of Goodison Glory&quot; to commemorate the occasion.

===Post-Taylor Report===
Following the publication of the 1990 Taylor Report, in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster, top-flight English football grounds had to become all-seated. At the time three of the four sides of the ground had standing areas. The Enclosure, fronting the main stand, had already been made all-seated in time for the 1987–88 season and was given the new name of Family Enclosure. The Paddock, the Park End terrace and the Gwladys Street terrace, known as &#x27;the Ground&#x27;, were standing and had to be replaced. The fences around the perimeter of the ground fronting the terracing (which were to prevent fans, notably hooligans, running onto the pitch) were removed immediately post Hillsborough, in time for the rearranged league fixture with Liverpool. The Everton match versus Luton Town in May 1991 was the final time that Gwladys Street allowed standing spectators. Seats were installed in the Paddock, while the Lower Gwladys Street was later completely rebuilt to accommodate seating with new concrete steps.

Everton opted to demolish the entire Park End stand in 1994 and replace it with a single-tier cantilever stand, with the assistance of a grant of £1.3 million from the Football Trust.

==Current structure==

Goodison Park has a total capacity of 39,572 all-seated and comprises four separate stands: the Goodison Road Stand, Gwladys Street Stand, Bullens Road Stand, and the Park End Stand.

===Goodison Road Stand===
Built in sections from 1969 to 1971 – replacing the large double-decker 1909 Archibald Leitch–designed stand – the Goodison Road Stand is a double-decker stand with the lower deck being two-tier. Each level is given a separate name. The middle-deck level is known as the Main Stand and is fronted by another seated section known as the Family Enclosure. The Enclosure was originally terracing prior to the advent of all-seater stadia. The Top Balcony is the highest part of the stadium. The stand became all-seater in 1987 and now has a capacity of 12,664.

The back wall of the stand cuts into the stand because of the non-square nature of the Goodison Park site. The Goodison Road Stand is also home to the conference and hospitality facilities. On non-match days Goodison Park holds conferences, weddings, meetings and parties on a daily basis.

===Bullens Road===

On the east side of the ground, the Bullens Road stand is divided into the Upper Bullens, Lower Bullens and The Paddock. The rear of the south end of the stand houses away supporters. The north corner of the stand is connected to the Gwladys Street Stand. The current capacity of the stand is 10,546. The stand takes its name from the adjacent Bullens Road. The Upper Bullens is decorated with Archibald Leitch&#x27;s distinctive truss design.

===Howard Kendall Gwladys Street End===
Behind the goal at the north end of Goodison Park, the Gwladys Street Stand is divided into Upper Gwladys and Lower Gwladys. This stand is the &quot;Popular End&quot;, holding the most boisterous and vociferous home supporters. It is known colloquially as &quot;The Street End&quot;. If Everton win the toss before kick-off the captain traditionally elects to play towards the Gwladys Street End in the second half. The stand has a capacity of 10,611 and gives its name to Gwladys Street&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In July 2016 the stand was renamed the Howard Kendall Gwladys Street End, in honour of Everton&#x27;s most successful manager.

===Sir Philip Carter Park Stand===

At the south end of the ground, behind one goal, the Park End Stand backs onto Walton Lane which borders Stanley Park. The name of the stand was originally the &quot;Stanley Park End&quot; but it is commonly referred to as the &quot;Park End&quot;. The single tiered stand broke from the multi-tiered tradition of Goodison Park. The Park End has the smallest capacity at Goodison Park. The current layout of the stand was opened on 17 September 1994 with a capacity of 5,750. It was opened by David Hunt, a Member of Parliament. During the structure&#x27;s development, fans were able to watch matches by climbing trees in neighbouring Stanley Park.

In the late 1970s and 1980s the stand accommodated the away fans. Previously it was open to home supporters. The lower tier of the old stand was terracing and this was closed off by the turn of the 1980s due to it being a fire hazard as the terracing steps were wooden. The front concrete terracing remained and was one of the last standing areas at a Premiership ground.
During the 1960s and 1970s, both ends of the ground featured a large arc behind the goals. This was created as a requirement for the 1966 World Cup because the crowd had to be a required distance from the goals.

The area around Goodison Park when built was a dense area full of terraced housing, and Goodison Avenue behind the Park End stand was no different. Oddly housing was built right into the stand itself (as shown on old photographs of Goodison and in programmes). The club had previously owned many of the houses on the road and rented them to players. One of the players to live there, Dixie Dean later had a statue erected in his honour near the Park End on Walton Lane.
By the 1990s the club had demolished virtually the whole street and this coincided with the redevelopment of the Park End stand. However at present the majority of the land is now an open car park for the club and its Marquee.

In July 2016 the stand was renamed the Sir Philip Carter Park Stand, in honour of the club&#x27;s former chairman.

===St Luke&#x27;s Church===
Goodison Park is unique in the sense that a church, St Luke&#x27;s, protrudes into the site between the Goodison Road Stand and the Gwladys Street Stand only yards from the corner flag. Everton do not play early kick-offs on Sundays in order to permit Sunday services at the church. The church is synonymous with the football club and a wooden church structure was in place when Goodison Park was originally built. Former Everton players such as Brian Harris have had their funeral service held there.

The church can be seen from the Park End and Bullens Road and has featured prominently over the years as a backdrop during live televised matches. It is also the home to the Everton Former Players&#x27; Foundation of which the Reverend is a trustee.

The church has over the years curtailed development of the ground. Everton did attempt to pay for its removal in order to gain extra space for a larger capacity. One of two jumbotron screens (both installed in 2000) has been installed between the Goodison Road stand and Gwladys Street stand partially obscuring the church from view. The other is situated between the Bullens Road and Park End.

Imaginative spectators would climb the church and watch a football game from the rooftop; however, they have now been deterred from doing so with the installation of security measures such as barbed wire and anti-climb paint. In addition, the introduction of the &#x27;all-seater&#x27; ruling following the Taylor Report has meant that spectators no longer resort to climbing nearby buildings for a glimpse of the event as a seat is guaranteed with a purchased ticket.

==The future==

Following the conversion of Goodison Park into an all-seater stadium in 1994, plans for relocation to a new site have been afoot since 1997, when then chairman Peter Johnson announced his intention to build a new 60,000-seat stadium for the club. At the time, no English league club had a stadium with such a high capacity.

In January 2001, plans were drawn up to move to a 55,000-seat purpose-built arena on the site of the King&#x27;s Dock in Liverpool. The proposed stadium would have had a retractable roof enabling it to be used for concerts and chairman Bill Kenwright had hoped to have it ready for the 2005–06 season.

However, the plans were abandoned in April 2003 due to the club not being able to raise adequate funds. Following this, plans were made to move to Kirkby, just outside the city, in a joint venture with the supermarket chain Tesco. The scheme was greatly divisive amongst supporters and local authorities, but was rejected in late November 2009 following a decision by Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.

The site of Goodison Park was earmarked in 1997 and 2003 for a food store by Tesco who offered £12 million which was valued at £4 million for the site but Liverpool City Council was advised against allowing planning permission. The club were advised that the planning permission required would not necessarily be granted, and chose not to take the scheme further.

Supporters&#x27; groups have fought against the club moving to a new stadium twice. In 2007, a group was established called &quot;Keep Everton in Our City&quot; (KEIOC) whose aim is to keep Everton FC inside the city of Liverpool. The KEIOC attempted to prevent the club moving to a new stadium in Kirkby, just outside the city’s boundaries. The supporters&#x27; groups have argued that it is possible to expand Goodison Park, despite the odd shaped landlocked site being surrounded by housing, local authority buildings, and have produced image renders, architectural drawings and costings for a redeveloped Goodison Park. The then Liverpool City Council leader Warren Bradley stated in November 2009 that a redevelopment of Goodison Park was his favoured option, and that relocation of the homes, infrastructure and businesses in streets adjoining the ground is &quot;not a major hurdle&quot;. Council leader Joe Anderson stated that &quot;the setback for Everton was an opportunity for both clubs to go back to the drawing board&quot;.

Everton was considering all options, including relocation, redevelopment of the current ground, or a groundshare with Liverpool F.C., in a new, purpose-built stadium in Stanley Park, stressing that finance was the main factor affecting decision-making. 
In 2010, Everton supporters approached University of Liverpool and Liverpool City Council to initiate a dedicated &#x27;Football Quarter&#x27;/&#x27;Sports City&#x27; zone around Goodison Park, Stanley Park and Anfield. The university and city council met with the North West Development Agency, Everton and Liverpool F.C. representatives but no further action was taken. Plans for relocation of Liverpool to a new stadium were later abandoned in favour of expanding Anfield.

On 10 February 2011, Liverpool City Council Regeneration and Transport Select Committee proposed to open the eastern section of the Liverpool Outer Loop line using &quot;Liverpool Football Club and Everton Football Club as priorities, as economic enablers of the project&quot;. This proposal would place both football clubs on a rapid-transit Merseyrail line circling the city giving high throughput, fast transport access.

In 2016, following his investment in the club by major shareholder Farhad Moshiri, the prospect of a new stadium was once again addressed, with a pair of options mentioned. The preferred option was to resurrect the idea of a riverside stadium, this time in partnership with the Peel Group using the Clarence Dock. However, the other option was a site located at Stonebridge Cross in Gillmoss, which is seen as more easily deliverable in some areas. The dockside site option was later confirmed as Bramley-Moore Dock.
===Walton Lane development===
In August 2010, Everton announced plans to build a new development situated between the Park End stand and Walton Lane; the site is currently used for a hospitality marquee. The £9m scheme was designed by Manchester-based Formroom Architects. In September 2010 the club submitted a planning application to Liverpool City Council. 

The proposed development is a four-storey building which include a retail store, ticket office, offices, conference and catering facilities and a museum. The project has been delayed twice and never happened in the end.

=== Goodison Park Legacy project ===
In February 2021, Liverpool City Council voted in favour of Everton&#x27;s £82m plan to redevelop Goodison Park into a mixed-use scheme featuring 173 homes and 51,000sq ft of offices. The approval followed the green light for the club&#x27;s new Everton Stadium, which is now nearing completion and will be occupied by the summer of 2025. In September 2024 Historic England issued a Certificate of Immunity from Listing, guaranteeing that the stadium and its structures would not be statutorily listed within the next five years.

As well as the homes and office space, the outline proposals for the Goodison Park site in Walton comprise a 63,000 sq ft, six-storey care home, more than 107,000 sq ft of space for community uses, and 8,000 sq ft of retail and leisure space.

==Transport==
Goodison Park is located two miles (3 km) north of Liverpool City Centre. Liverpool Lime Street railway station is the nearest mainline station. The nearest station to the stadium is Kirkdale railway station on the Merseyrail Northern Line which is located just over half a mile (800 m) away. On match days there is also a frequent shuttle bus service from Sandhills railway station known as &quot;SoccerBus&quot;. In 2007 Sandhills underwent a £6million renovation to help encourage people to use the rail service.

Walton &amp; Anfield railway station located on Walton Lane—the same road that the Park End backs onto—was the nearest station to Goodison Park until its closure in 1948. Although Everton has now shifted towards a new stadium away from Goodison Park it remained a suggestion that the station could be re-opened should the freight only Canada Dock Branch line once again run passenger trains.

There are on-site parking facilities for supporters (limited to 230 spaces) and the streets surrounding the ground allow parking only for residents with permits. The Car Parking resident parking scheme is operated by Liverpool City Council.

==Records==
Everton has staged more top-flight football games than any other club in England, eleven more seasons than second placed Aston Villa. With Goodison Park about to be closed by the end of the 2024–25 season, Everton have played here for all but 4 of their 122 league seasons in the top tier, giving it the distinction of hosting more top-flight games than any other ground in England for its time. Goodison is the only English club ground to have hosted a FIFA World Cup semi final. Until the expansion of Old Trafford in 1996 Goodison Park held the record Sunday attendance on a Football League ground (53,509 v West Bromwich Albion, FA Cup, 1974).

Everton won 15 home league games in a row between 4 October 1930 and 4 April 1931. In the 1931–32 season Goodison Park was the venue of the most goals scored at home in a league season, 84 by Everton. Between 23 April 1984 and 2 September 1986 Everton scored consecutively in 47 games., registering 36 wins and 7 draws and scoring 123 goals in the process while conceding 38. Scottish striker Graeme Sharp scored 32 of these goals.

Jack Southworth holds the record for most goals scored in one game at Goodison Park, scoring six versus West Bromwich Albion on 30 December 1893.

The most goals scored in a game at Goodison Park is 12, this occurred in two Everton games; versus Sheffield Wednesday (9–3) on 17 October 1931 and versus Plymouth Argyle (8–4) on 27 February 1954.

==Attendances==

Whilst at Goodison Park the club has had one of the highest average attendances in the country. The stadium has only had six seasons where Everton FC has not been amongst the top ten highest attendances in the country.

The highest average attendance in the club&#x27;s history has been 51,603 (1962–63) and the lowest was 13,230 (1892–93) which was recorded in Goodison Park&#x27;s first year.

==Other uses==
Despite being purposefully built for Everton F.C. to play football, Goodison Park has hosted many other types of events.

===Goodison Park as host stadium for football===
Goodison Park became the first Football League ground to hold an FA Cup Final, in 1894. Notts County beat Bolton Wanderers, watched by crowd of 37,000. An FA Cup final replay was staged in 1910 with Newcastle United beating Barnsley 2–0.

On 27 December 1920, Goodison Park hosted a match between Dick, Kerr&#x27;s Ladies &amp; St Helens Ladies, which was attended by an estimated 53,000 people, at a time when the average gate at Goodison Park in 1919–20 was near 29,000. Dick, Kerr&#x27;s Ladies won 4–0. More than £3,000 was raised for charity. Shortly after, the Football Association banned women&#x27;s football on official pitches. The reasons given by the FA were not substantial and it is perceived by some that the women&#x27;s teams were a threat to the men&#x27;s game. The ban was lifted in 1970.

During the Second World War, Goodison Park was chosen as a host venue for the &quot;Football League – Northern Section&quot;.

In 1949, Goodison Park became the site of England&#x27;s first ever defeat on English soil by a non-Home Nations country, namely the Republic of Ireland. The ground hosted five matches including a semi-final for the 1966 FIFA World Cup. In April 1895 Goodison Park hosted England versus Scotland and so Everton became the first club to host England internationals on two grounds (the other being Anfield in 1889 when England won 6–2 versus Ireland). The city of Liverpool also became the first English city to stage England games at three different venues, the other being Aigburth Cricket Club.

In 1973 Goodison hosted Northern Ireland&#x27;s home games against Wales and England.

====1966 FIFA World Cup====
Goodison Park hosted five games during the 1966 FIFA World Cup. The original schedule of the 1966 World Cup meant that if England won their group and then reached the Semi final, the match would be held at Goodison Park. However, the organising committee were allowed to swap the venues, with England playing Portugal at Wembley Stadium.

=====Group stage=====


=====Quarter-finals=====
=====Semi-finals=====
Portugal&#x27;s Eusébio won the tournament&#x27;s Golden Boot scoring nine goals, six of them at Goodison Park. Eusébio later stated that &quot;Goodison Park is for me the best stadium in my life&quot;. In Garrincha&#x27;s 50 caps for Brazil, the only defeat he experienced was in the game versus Hungary at Goodison Park.

====FA Cup Final====
Two years after construction, Goodison Park was chosen by the Football Association to host the final of the FA Cup.

====British Home championships====

=====England=====
Goodison Park has played host to England on eight occasions during the Home Championships. When Everton player Alex Stevenson scored for Ireland in the 1935 British Home Championship versus England, he became the first player to score an international away goal on his club&#x27;s home ground.

=====Northern Ireland=====
On 22 February 1973 the Irish Football Association announced that Northern Ireland&#x27;s home matches in the 1973 British Home Championship would be moved to Goodison Park due to the civil unrest within Belfast at that time.

Both Northern Ireland goalscorers Dave Clements (vs. England) and Bryan Hamilton (vs. Wales) went on to play for Goodison Park&#x27;s club side Everton later on in their careers.

====Other neutral matches at Goodison Park====
===Non-football usage===

On 11 July 1913 Goodison Park became the first English football ground to be visited by a reigning monarch when King George V and Queen Mary attended. The attending royals had opened Gladstone Dock on the same day. A tablet was unveiled in the Main Stand to mark the occasion. During the First World War Goodison frequently hosted Territorial Army training drill sessions.

On 19 May 1938 George VI and Queen Elizabeth attended Goodison Park to present new colours to the 5th Battalion the King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool) and the Liverpool Scottish (Queens Own Cameron Highlanders) in front of 80,000 spectators.

In 1921, Goodison Park played host to Lancashire&#x27;s rugby league team when they took on Australia national rugby league team and lost 29–6.
Goodison Park was chosen as one of two English venues for the Sox-Giants 1924 World Tour. On 23 October 1924, 2,000 spectators witnessed US baseball teams Chicago White Sox and New York Giants participate in an exhibition match. One player managed to hit a ball clear over the large Goodison Road Stand. The other English venue selected was Stamford Bridge.

In September 1939, Goodison Park was commandeered by military, the club&#x27;s minutes read: &quot;The Chairman reported that our ground has been commandeered as an anti-aircraft (Balloon Barrage section), post.&quot; During World War Two, an American forces baseball league was based at Goodison Park. In addition, a baseball game between two Army Air Force nines watched by over 8,000 spectators raised over $3,000 for British Red Cross and St. John&#x27;s Ambulance fund.

The Liverpool Trojans and Formby Cardinals were the last two teams to play baseball at Goodison Park. This was in the Lancashire Cup Final in 1948.

Goodison Park is used as a venue for weddings. More than 800 fans&#x27; ashes have been buried at Goodison Park and since 2004 the club have had to reject further requests because there is no room for any more. Tommy Lawton wanted his ashes to be scattered at Goodison but his son chose to donate them to the national football museum because of Goodison&#x27;s uncertain future.

Goodison Park was also the venue for the boxing match between &quot;Pretty&quot; Ricky Conlan (played by native Evertonian and Everton fan Tony Bellew) and Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) in the 2015 movie &quot;Creed&quot;. The stadium hosted the first outdoor boxing event in Liverpool since 1949 when Bellew defeated Ilunga Makabu on 29 May 2016 to claim the vacant WBC Cruiserweight title.

====Rugby League at Goodison Park====
Between 1908 and 1921, Goodison Park also played host to four rugby league Kangaroo Tour matches involving the n and Australasian teams from 1908 to 1921.

<text>Edmund Kirby Smith (May 16, 1824March 28, 1893) was a Confederate States Army general, who oversaw the Trans-Mississippi Department (comprising Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, western Louisiana, Arizona Territory and the Indian Territory) from 1863 to 1865. Before the American Civil War, Smith served as an officer of the United States Army.

Smith was wounded at the First Battle of Bull Run and distinguished himself during the Heartland Offensive, the Confederacy&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to capture Kentucky in 1862. He was appointed as commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department in January 1863. The area included most actions east of the Rocky Mountains and west of the Mississippi River. In 1863, Smith dispatched troops in an unsuccessful attempt to relieve the Siege of Vicksburg. After the United States took control of Vicksburg in July, the Trans-Mississippi Department was cut off from the rest of the Confederacy and became virtually an independent nation, nicknamed &quot;Kirby Smithdom&quot;. In the Red River Campaign of Spring 1864, he commanded victorious Confederate troops under Major-General Richard Taylor, who defeated a combined Union Army and Navy assault under U.S. Major-General Nathaniel P. Banks. On June 2, 1865, Smith surrendered his army at Galveston, Texas, the last general with a major field force. 

He quickly fled to Mexico and then to Cuba to avoid arrest for treason. His wife negotiated his return during the period when the U.S. government offered amnesty to those who would take an oath of loyalty to the United States. After the war, Smith worked in the telegraph and railway industries. He also served as a professor of mathematics at the University of the South in Tennessee. He botanized plant specimens and bequeathed his collection to the University of Florida.

== Early life and education ==

Edmund Kirby Smith was born in 1824 in St. Augustine, Florida, as the youngest child of Joseph Lee Smith, an attorney, and Frances ( Kirby) Smith. Both his parents were natives of Litchfield, Connecticut, where their older children were born. The family moved to Florida in 1821, as the senior Smith was appointed as a Superior Court judge in the new Florida Territory, acquired by the U.S. from Spain. Older siblings included Ephraim, born in 1807; and sisters Frances, born in 1809, and Josephine, who died in 1835, likely of tuberculosis. He was interested in botany and nature, but in 1836, Smith&#x27;s parents sent their second son to a military boarding school in Virginia, and strongly encouraged a military career. He later enrolled in the United States Military Academy.

In 1837, his sister Frances married Lucien Bonaparte Webster, a West Point graduate from Vermont and career U.S. Army artillery officer, whom she met when he was stationed at Fort Marion in St. Augustine. His commanding officer at the fort was the young Smiths&#x27; uncle. Webster later served in the Mexican–American War and died of yellow fever in 1853 when stationed on the Texas frontier at Fort Brown.

On July 1, 1841, Smith entered West Point and was graduated four years later in 1845, ranking 25th out of 41 cadets. While there, he was nicknamed &quot;Seminole&quot;, after the Seminole people of Florida who had successfully resisted removal by the United States. He was commissioned as a brevet second lieutenant in the 5th U.S. Infantry on July 1, 1845. Smith was promoted to second lieutenant on August 22, 1846, now serving in the 7th U.S. Infantry.

== Early military career ==

In the Mexican–American War, Smith served under General Zachary Taylor at the Battle of Palo Alto and the Battle of Resaca de la Palma. He later served under General Winfield Scott and received brevet promotions to first lieutenant for Cerro Gordo and to captain for Contreras and Churubusco. His older brother, Ephraim Kirby Smith (1807–1847), who was graduated from West Point in 1826 and was a captain in the regular army, served with him in the 5th U.S. Infantry in the campaigns with both Taylor and Scott. Ephraim died in 1847 from wounds suffered at the Battle of Molino del Rey.

After that war, Smith served as a captain (from 1855) in the 2nd U.S. Cavalry, primarily in Texas. From that year on through the war, Smith was accompanied by the youth Alexander Darnes, then 15, a mixed-race person enslaved by his family, who was forced to work as his valet until emancipation and who may have been his half-brother.

Smith also taught at West Point after the war. He collected and studied materials as a botanist; like many other military officers, he was also a scientist. He donated to the Smithsonian Institution some of his collection and reports from his time at West Point. Smith continued his botanical studies as a hobby for the remainder of his life. He is credited with collecting and describing several species of plants native to Tennessee and Florida. Smith was assigned to teach mathematics at West Point from 1849 to 1852. According to his letters to his mother, he was happy with this environment.

Returning to troop-leading assignments, Smith served in the Southwest. On May 13, 1859, he was wounded in his thigh while fighting Comanche in the Nescutunga Valley of Kansas. also known as the Battle of Crooked Creek (Kansas). When Texas declared secession from the United States in 1861, Smith, promoted to major on January 31, 1861, refused to surrender his command at Camp Colorado in what is now Coleman, to the Texas State Troops under Colonel Benjamin McCulloch; he expressed his willingness to fight to hold it. On April 6, he resigned his commission in the United States Army to join the Confederacy.

== American Civil War==
On March 16, 1861, Smith entered the Confederate States Army as a major in the regular artillery; that day, he was transferred to the regular cavalry with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. After serving briefly as Brigadier-General Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s assistant adjutant general in the Shenandoah Valley, Smith was promoted to brigadier-general on June 17, 1861. He was given command of a brigade in the Army of the Shenandoah, which he led at the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21. Wounded severely in the neck and shoulder, he recuperated while commanding the Department of Middle and East Florida. He returned to duty on October 11 as a major-general and division commander in the Army of Northern Virginia.

=== Army of Tennessee ===
In February 1862, Smith was sent west to command the eastern division of the Army of Mississippi (often referred to prematurely as the Army of Tennessee). Cooperating with General Braxton Bragg in the invasion of Kentucky, he scored a victory at the Battle of Richmond, Kentucky on August 30, 1862, but did not link up with Bragg&#x27;s army until after the Battle of Perryville. On October 9, he was promoted to the newly created grade of lieutenant-general, commanding the 3d Corps, Army of Tennessee. Smith received the Confederate &quot;Thanks of Congress&quot; on February 17, 1864, for his actions at Richmond.

=== Trans-Mississippi Department ===
On January 14, 1863, Smith was transferred to command the Trans-Mississippi Department (comprising Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, western Louisiana, Arizona Territory, and the Indian Territory). He remained west of the Mississippi River for the balance of the war, based part of this time in Shreveport, Louisiana. As forces under U.S. Major-General Ulysses S. Grant tightened their grip on the river, Smith attempted to intervene. However, his department never had more than 30,000 men stationed over an immense area, and he could not concentrate forces adequately to challenge Grant nor the U.S. Navy on the river.

Following the U.S. capture of the remaining strongholds at Vicksburg and Port Hudson and their closing of the Mississippi to the Confederacy, Smith was virtually cut off from the Confederate capital at Richmond. He had to command a nearly independent area of the Confederacy, with all the inherent administrative problems. The area became known in the Confederacy as &quot;Kirby Smithdom&quot;. He was thought of as a virtual military dictator and negotiated directly with foreign countries.

In the spring of 1864, General Taylor, directly under Smith&#x27;s command, soundly defeated General Banks at the Battle of Mansfield in the Red River Campaign on April 8, 1864. After the Battle of Pleasant Hill on April 9, Smith joined Taylor and dispatched half of Taylor&#x27;s army, Walker&#x27;s Greyhounds, under the command of Major-General John George Walker, northward to defeat U.S. Major-General Frederick Steele&#x27;s incursion into Arkansas. This decision, vehemently opposed by Taylor, caused great enmity between the two men.

With the pressure relieved to the north, Smith attempted to send reinforcements east of the Mississippi. But, as in the case of his earlier attempts to relieve Vicksburg, it proved impossible due to U.S. Navy control of the river. Instead, he dispatched Major-General Sterling Price, with all available cavalry, on an unsuccessful invasion of Missouri. He conducted the war west of the river through small raids and guerrilla warfare.

By now a general (as of February 19, 1864, one of seven generals in the Confederate Army), Smith negotiated the surrender of his department on May 26, 1865. While Brigadier General Stand Watie and the 1st Cherokee Mounted Rifles regiment did not surrender until June 23, 1865, Smith was the last full general to do so and signed the terms of surrender in Galveston, Texas, on June 2, nearly eight weeks after Robert E. Lee&#x27;s surrender. He immediately left the country for Mexico and then to Cuba, to escape potential prosecution for treason. In August of that year, General Beauregard&#x27;s house near New Orleans was surrounded by Federal troops who suspected the general of harboring Smith. All the inhabitants were locked in a cotton press overnight. Beauregard complained to General Sheridan, who expressed annoyance at the treatment of the high-ranking officer, his erstwhile enemy. Smith returned to the United States later that year to take an oath of amnesty at Lynchburg, Virginia, on November 14, 1865.

== Later life ==
After the war, Smith was active in the telegraph business and higher education. From 1866 to 1868, he was president of the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company. When that effort failed, he started a preparatory school in New Castle, Kentucky, which he directed until it burned in 1870. He served as the chancellor of the University of Nashville from 1870 to 1875. He headed the newly-created Montgomery Bell Academy there, with former Confederate General Bushrod Johnson as principal.

In 1875, Smith left that post to become a professor of mathematics and botany at the University of the South at Sewanee, Tennessee. Part of his collection from those years was donated to the universities of North Carolina and Harvard, and to the Smithsonian Institution. He kept up a correspondence with botanists at other institutions. He taught at the University of the South until he died of pneumonia in 1893. He was the last surviving full general from the Civil War. He is buried in the University Cemetery at Sewanee.

== Personal life ==
In August 1861, Smith met Cassie Selden (1836–1905), the daughter of Samuel S. Selden of Lynchburg. While recovering from being wounded at the First Battle of Manassas, he still found time for wooing. The couple married on September 24. Cassie wrote on October 10, 1862, from Lynchburg, asking what to name their first child. She suggested, &quot;something uncommon as I consider her an &quot;uncommon&quot; baby.&quot; The new baby was later named Caroline.

The couple briefly reunited when Cassie followed her husband to Shreveport in February 1863. In the spring of 1864, she moved to Hempstead, Texas, where she remained for the duration of the war. After the war&#x27;s end, Cassie traveled to Washington to negotiate for her husband&#x27;s return to the United States from Cuba, where he had fled.

In 1875, Smith accepted an appointment as a professor at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. There the family lived happily until the end of his life. They had five sons and six daughters: Caroline (1862–1941), Frances (1864–1930), Edmund (1866–1938), Lydia (1868–1962), Nina (1870–1965), Elizabeth (1872–1937), Reynold (1874–1962), William (1876–1967), Josephine (1878–1961), Joseph Lee (1882–1939), and Ephraim (1884–1938).

Reynold, William, Joseph, and Ephraim all played for the Sewanee Tigers football team. Joseph and Ephraim both achieved All-Southern status in football. Joseph was a member of the famed 1899 &quot;Iron Men&quot; and Ephraim was selected for Sewanee&#x27;s All-Time football team.

== Legacy ==
*A dormitory building on the campus of LSU in Baton Rouge was named Edmund Kirby Smith Hall. It was demolished in 2022.
*A portrait of Edmund Kirby Smith by Cornelius Hankins hangs in the Wyatt Center at Vanderbilt University.
*In 1922, the state of Florida erected a statue of General Smith as one of Florida&#x27;s two statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. (The other is of John Gorrie, inventor of mechanical refrigeration and air conditioning.) On March 19, 2018, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed legislation to replace the statue with one of African-American civil rights activist and educator Mary McLeod Bethune. The statue was to be moved to the Lake County Historical Museum in Tavares, after residents of his birthplace, St. Augustine, expressed no interest. While Smith never lived in Lake County, when he was born, it was a part of St. Johns County, whose seat is St. Augustine. At a County Commission meeting on July 24, 2018, about 24 residents spoke against, and none in favor, of bringing the statue to Lake County. Chairman Sullivan assured the crowd that the commission would tell the Historical Museum &quot;that there is no longer a want or desire to bring this statue to Lake County&quot;. Despite the strong opposition from the public and nine mayors in the county, the Board of County Commissioners voted on August 6, 2019, to approve the statue installation. Hundreds protested the transfer of the statue to Lake County on August 10, 2019, and citizen groups posted an online petition voicing opposition to the project, whose local sponsor was the Sons of Confederate Veterans. On July 7, 2020, Lake County commissioners voted 4–1 against accepting the statue.
*At the University of the South, in Sewanee, Tennessee, where he taught, he is commemorated by Kirby-Smith Point.
*The Kirby-Smith Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy at Sewanee, and the Kirby-Smith Camp 1209, Sons of Confederate Veterans, in Jacksonville, Florida, are named for him.
*Kirby Smith Middle School in Jacksonville was named for him. It was renamed Springfield Middle School in 2020. 
*During World War II the liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, in 1943, and named for him.
*In 2004, a life-sized statue of Kirby Smith and Alexander Darnes in an imaginary meeting (see below) was made by Maria Kirby Smith, a great-granddaughter of Smith. It is installed in the courtyard of the Segui-Kirby Smith House, now owned by the St. Augustine Historical Society. This is the first public sculpture in the city to commemorate an African-American man. Kirby-Smith said that she suspected Darnes was related to Smith as a half-brother or nephew, as her detailed work on the statues made her aware of the two men&#x27;s close physical resemblance.

<doc id="523896" wikidata="Q11979862" url="?curid=523896" title="Kabul–Kandahar Highway">
<text>The Kabul–Kandahar Highway (NH0101) is long that links Afghanistan&#x27;s two largest cities, Kabul and Kandahar. It starts from Dashte Barchi in Kabul and passes through Maidan Shar, Saydabad, Ghazni, and Qalat until it reaches Aino Mina in Kandahar. It is currently being rehabilitated at different locations. This highway is a key portion of Afghanistan&#x27;s national highway system or &quot;National Highway 1&quot;. The entire highway between Kabul and Kandahar has no mountain passes but there are many mountains nearby in some places. Approximately 35 percent of Afghanistan&#x27;s population lives within of the Kabul to Kandahar portion of the Afghanistan Ring Road.

==History==
The Kabul–Kandahar Highway is said to have been designed and asphalted in the 1960s by Afghan and American engineers under contracts with the United States International Cooperation Administration. This was a time when the Soviet Union and the United States were spreading their influence in Afghanistan. In those years the highway was mostly used by trucks and buses because private vehicles were very few when compared to the present time. In the 1980s, in addition to trucks and private vehicles, military convoys of the Soviet Union were often seen passing back and forth between Kabul and Kandahar. The highway began deteriorating in the 1990s.

In late 2002 or early 2003, during the presidency of Hamid Karzai, the United States funded the repair and rebuilding of of road (at a cost of about $190 million), while Japan funded . Only about of the highway was usable prior to the repairs. The rebuilding project was overseen by the Louis Berger Group, with assistance in planning and design by Turkish and Indian engineers. Phase one of paving was completed in December 2003 and the highway was opened to traffic. The journey from Kandahar to Kabul generally took travelers 18 hours but, since the rebuilding, has been shortened to roughly 6 hours.

In 2022 the Government of Afghanistan decided to rebuild and repair the highway. Work soon began in sections of the highway in different provinces of the country. Construction of a toll plaza began in Kabul Province in late 2022. Another toll plaza is planned to be constructed in Kandahar Province. 

The Dashte Barchi bus terminus provides transport services to the provinces of Maidan Wardak, Bamyan, Ghazni, Daikundi and Ghor. Another such terminal is in Aino Mina in Kandahar, and yet another on the western end of that city which provides bus services to Lashkar Gah, Zaranj, Farah and Herat. The bus terminals are regulated by the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation.

==Route==
The Kabul–Kandahar Highway starts from Dashte Barchi in the western section of Kabul. It traverses the provinces of Kabul, Maidan Wardak, Ghazni, Zabul, and Kandahar.

==Major accidents and security issues==
As of early 2004, Taliban fighters continued to harass travelers of the corridor. Afghan guards, soldiers, mercenaries, and workers have been killed along the route. In October 2003, they kidnapped a Turkish contractor, and that December they kidnapped two Indian workers. In February 2004, Taliban rebels shot down a Louis Berger Group helicopter, killing three.

In March 2004, rebels murdered a Turkish engineer and an Afghan guard. Another Turkish engineer and an interpreter were kidnapped. This action prompted the United States to set up small civilian-military teams in three locations along the route. These teams no longer exist.

On May 8, 2016, a major vehicular crash killed at least 73 and injured over 50 people along the Kabul-Kandahar Highway in Moqor District of Ghazni Province. Two buses traveling from Kabul to Kandahar collided with a fuel tanker, causing a fiery inferno. The vehicles were reportedly speeding to avoid ambush by the Taliban. At least 38 persons died in September 2016 when a fuel tanker collided with a passenger bus in the Jildak area of Zabul Province. A provincial government spokesperson blamed the accident on the recklessness of drivers of both vehicles.

On December 18, 2024, a total of 50 people are killed and 76 others are injured in two separate crashes along the highway in Ghazni Province, including a collision between a passenger bus and an oil tanker.

<text>The Gospel of the Hebrews (), or Gospel according to the Hebrews, is a lost Jewish–Christian gospel. The text of the gospel is lost, with only fragments of it surviving as brief quotations by the early Church Fathers and in apocryphal writings. The fragments contain traditions of Jesus&#x27; pre-existence, incarnation, baptism, and probably of his temptation, along with some of his sayings. Distinctive features include a Christology characterized by the belief that the Holy Spirit is Jesus&#x27; Divine Mother and a first resurrection appearance to James, the brother of Jesus, showing high regard for James as the leader of the Jewish Christian church in Jerusalem. It was probably composed in Greek in the first decades of the 2nd century and is believed to have been used by Greek-speaking Jewish Christians in Egypt during that century.

The Gospel of the Hebrews is the only Jewish–Christian gospel that the Church Fathers referred to by name, believing there was only one Hebrew Gospel, perhaps in different versions. This has created confusion as modern scholars believe that the Church Fathers were, in reality, quoting three different gospels. All are known today only from fragments preserved in quotations by the early Church Fathers. Modern scholars have given these three different gospels the working name Gospel of the Hebrews, the Gospel of the Nazarenes, and the Gospel of the Ebionites.

Passages from the gospel of the Hebrews were quoted or summarized by three Alexandrian Fathers – Clement, Origen and Didymus the Blind; it was also quoted by Jerome, either directly or through the commentaries of Origen.

The gospel was used as a supplement to the canonical gospels to provide source material for their commentaries based on scripture. Eusebius included it in his list of disputed writings known as the Antilegomena, noting that it was used by &quot;Hebrews&quot; within the Church; it fell out of use when the New Testament canon was codified at the end of the 4th century.

== Origin and characteristics ==
The Gospel of the Hebrews, as known to scholars, is thought to have been composed in Greek. The provenance has been associated with Egypt; it probably began circulating in Alexandria, Egypt, in the first decades of the 2nd century and was used by Greek-speaking Jewish–Christian communities there. The communities to which they belonged were traditional, conservative Christians who followed the teaching of the early Jewish Christian church in Jerusalem, integrating their understanding of Jesus with strict observance of Jewish customs and law, which they regarded as essential to salvation. Despite this, the gospel displays no connection with other Jewish–Christian literature, nor does it appear to be based on the Greek rendition of the Gospel of Matthew or the other canonical gospels of what is now orthodox Christianity. Instead, it seems to be taken from alternative oral forms of the same underlying traditions. Some of the fragments suggest a syncretic gnostic influence, while others support close ties to traditional Jewish Wisdom literature.

== Content ==
The Gospel of the Hebrews is preserved in fragments quoted or summarized by various early Church Fathers. The full extent of the original gospel is unknown; according to a list of canonical and apocryphal works drawn up in the 9th century, known as the Stichometry of Nicephorus, the gospel was 2,200 lines, just 300 lines shorter than Matthew. Based on the surviving fragments, the overall structure of the gospel appears to have been similar to the canonical ones. It consisted of a narrative of the life of Jesus which included his baptism, temptation, transfiguration, Last Supper, crucifixion, and resurrection. There was no virgin birth narrative or genealogy of Jesus. The gospel also contained sayings of Jesus. The events in the life of Jesus have been interpreted in a way that reflects Jewish ideas present in a Hellenistic cultural environment.

There is wide agreement about seven quotations cited by Philipp Vielhauer in the critical 3rd German edition of Wilhelm Schneemelcher&#x27;s &quot;New Testament Apocrypha&quot;, translated by George Ogg. The translations below follow Vielhauer&#x27;s order:

Fragment 2 uses the language of Jewish Wisdom literature, but applies it to the Holy Spirit: the Spirit has waited through all the prophets for the Son. The &quot;rest&quot; that the Holy Spirit finds in the Son may reflect the Christian gnostic idea of the pre-existent Redeemer who finally becomes incarnate in Jesus.

Fragments 2 and 3 identify Jesus as the son of the Holy Spirit; this idea is found also in the Egyptian Coptic Epistle of James, another indication of the Egyptian origin of the gospel.

Fragment 4 is a &quot;chain-saying&quot;, seek–find–marvel–reign–rest, describing the steps towards salvation, where &quot;rest&quot; equals the state of salvation. The saying is similar to themes found in Jewish Wisdom literature, and the similarity to a saying in the Gospel of Thomas suggests that the text may have been influenced by gnostic Wisdom teaching.

Fragments 5 (on Ephesians 5.4) and 6 (on Ezekiel 18.7) are ethical sayings of Jesus, suggesting that such teachings formed a significant part of the gospel.

Fragment 7 emphasizes the importance of James, the brother of Jesus and head of the Jewish–Christian movement in Jerusalem after Jesus&#x27; death, thereby testifying to the Jewish character of the community of the gospel.

In addition to direct quotations, other gospel stories were summarized or cited by the Church Fathers. The translations below are from Vielhauer &amp; Strecker (1991), except &quot;b2&quot; which is from Klauck (2003):

The summary of a gospel passage identifies Mattias, (which is the Greek form of Matthew, from Hebrew Matityahu, meaning &quot;gift of God&quot;) as the name of the tax-collector who was called to follow Jesus.

The citation by Eusebius of a story he found in the writings of Papias is believed to refer to an alternate version of the account in John&#x27;s gospel of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery.

Although Didymus does not name his source, he found this independent tradition of the story of the sinful woman in a non-canonical gospel in Alexandria which may have been the Gospel of the Hebrews.

== Christology ==
The theology of the gospel is strongly influenced by Jewish–Christian wisdom teaching. The Holy Spirit is represented as a manifestation of Divine Wisdom who is called &quot;Mother&quot;. The feminine aspect of the Spirit is an indication of Semitic influence on the language of the gospel. The Spirit takes Jesus to Mount Tabor by a single hair, echoing Old Testament themes in the stories of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 8:3) and Habbakuk (Dan. 14:36 LXX). The gospel emphasizes the fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah 11:2 in Jesus&#x27; baptism, but also adopts elements of Jewish Wisdom theology. The Spirit has been gathered in one place at the moment of Jesus&#x27; baptism, so that he has become the only Son of the Spirit in which he has found eternal &quot;rest&quot; and reigns forever. The &quot;seek–find&quot; and &quot;rule–rest&quot; language also comes from Jewish Wisdom tradition as stages on the way to salvation during which the believer is encouraged to emulate divine Wisdom.

The &quot;rest&quot; that the Holy Spirit waits for and finally finds in the Son is also found in Gnostic speculations. The wisdom chain-saying which describes the progression of seeking, marveling, and finding salvation, is similar to the Hermetic conception of salvation found in the Alexandrian . &quot;Rest&quot; is not only to be understood as the ultimate goal of the seeker after truth, which leads to salvation; it is also descriptive of a unity with the wisdom which lies at the heart of the Godhead. The &quot;resting&quot; of the Holy Spirit at the moment of Jesus&#x27; Baptism may also be understood in this timeless sense, as the union and rest of the pre-existent Son with his Father, in keeping with the Gnostic conception of &quot;rest&quot; as the highest gift of salvation.

== Reception ==

Eusebius listed the Gospel of the Hebrews in his &quot;Antilegomena&quot; as one of the disputed writings of the early Church. Despite this, the Church Fathers occasionally used it, with reservations, as a source to support their exegetical arguments. Eusebius reports that the 2nd century Church Father Hegesippus used the gospel as a source for writing his &quot;Hypomneumata&quot; (&quot;Memoranda&quot;) in Rome (c. 175–180). The Alexandrian Fathers – Clement, Origen, and Didymus the Blind – relied directly on the gospel to provide prooftexts as a supplement to the canonical gospels. Clement quoted from the gospel as part of a discourse on divine Wisdom. Origen used it to compare differing views of the relationship between the Word and the Holy Spirit. Jerome claimed to have used the gospel as a prooftext, although he may have relied in part on excerpts from the commentaries of Origen. He quoted from it as a proof from prophecy based on Isaiah 11:2 to explain how Jesus was the fulfillment of messianic expectations. The Gospel of the Hebrews was excluded from the canon by the early Church with the closing of the New Testament canon at the end of the 4th century, and was no longer cited as a source in Church literature.

Subsequent to the closing of the canon, the gospel is mentioned in a homily &quot;On the Virgin Mary&quot; attributed to Cyril of Jerusalem in a collection of apocryphal stories believed to have been written in Coptic in the first half of the 6th century. The author (known to scholars as Pseudo-Cyril) refers to the Gospel of the Hebrews in a polemical dialogue between a monk and Cyril over the nature of Mary, whom the monk contends was a divine power sent from heaven. Cyril condemns the monk&#x27;s teaching as a heresy, which the author attributes to Carpocrates, Satornilus, and Ebionites. Not all later mentions of the gospel were polemical; Bede (), after listing some apocryphal gospels rejected by the Church, includes the Gospel of the Hebrews among the &quot;ecclesiastical histories&quot; and refers to its usage by Jerome.

== Relationship to other texts ==
The early Church Fathers believed there was only one Jewish–Christian gospel, perhaps in different versions; however, scholars have long recognized the possibility there were at least two or three. Jerome&#x27;s references to a Gospel of the Hebrews, or variants of that name, are particularly problematic because it is unclear which gospel he is referring to as the source of his quotations. Hegesippus, Eusebius, and Jerome all used an Aramaic gospel, which Jerome referred to as the gospel used by a Jewish Christian sect known as the Nazarenes. The Gospel of the Nazarenes is the name adopted by scholars to describe the fragments of quotations believed to originate from an Aramaic gospel that was based on traditions similar to the Gospel of Matthew. A third gospel was known only to Epiphanius of Salamis, which he attributed to a second Jewish Christian group known as the Ebionites. Scholars have conventionally referred to seven fragments of a Greek gospel harmony preserved in quotations by Epiphanius as the Gospel of the Ebionites. The existence of three independent Jewish–Christian gospels with distinct characteristics has been regarded as an established consensus. However, that conclusion has recently been challenged with respect to the composition of the gospel known to the Nazarenes and its relationship to the Gospel of the Hebrews. Others suggest that these three titles may have been referring to one and the same book. The relationship between the Gospel of the Hebrews and the other Jewish–Christian gospels, as well as a hypothetical original Hebrew Gospel, is uncertain and has been an ongoing subject of scholarly investigation.

<text>Liberty Media Corporation (commonly referred to as Liberty Media or just Liberty) is an American mass media company founded by John C. Malone in 1991. The company has three divisions, reflecting its ownership stakes in the Formula One Group, Sirius XM, and Live Nation Entertainment. The Sirius XM Holdings segment operates two audio entertainment companies, Sirius XM and Pandora. Sirius XM offers channels and information and entertainment services. Pandora is a streaming platform for searching for music and podcasts. Liberty Media is set to own three global motorsport businesses in the form of Formula One, Grand Prix motorcycle racing and World Superbikes.

== History ==

=== 1991–1999 ===
Liberty Media began in March 1991 as a spin-off of Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI), a U.S. cable-television group. Peter Barton, hired by TCI&#x27;s Malone, served as president until retiring in April 1997. The company took over TCI assets considered to have little value, but Barton completed &quot;a deal every ten days for six years&quot; and made the company a big success. Liberty was merged back into TCI in the mid-1990s. In 1995, Liberty Media acquired a 49% ownership stake in the Faith &amp; Values Channel (which would later be known as the Hallmark Channel), and took over operational control of the network, adding more secular and family-oriented programming. It was rebranded as the Odyssey Network in 1996. On March 13, 1998, Liberty Media Group and TCI Group announced the merger of Encore and STARZ! into a single company—Encore Media Group, owned by Liberty. Encore was taking advantage of the growth of digital cable, while TCI, which had previously owned twenty percent of Encore, was more interested in traditional cable.

After U.S. Department of Justice approval that required TCI to sell its 23.5% interest in Sprint Corporation PSC, TCI was acquired by AT&amp;T on March 9, 1999, for approximately $48 billion. Liberty Media merged with TCI Ventures Group LLC (TCIVA), TCI&#x27;s telephone and Internet businesses, and the resulting company became part of AT&amp;T, giving Liberty Media $5.5 billion to repurchase stock or buy other companies. AT&amp;T bought the other TCI businesses—@Home Corp., National Digital Television Center and Western Tele-Communications Inc.—for $2.5 billion in cash. TCI chairman Malone, who became head of the new company, said buyers would not want all of TCI, but they would be interested in Liberty Media. Malone wanted to start a finance unit similar to GE Capital, which could start new cable or Internet services. TCI had already planned digital cable set-top boxes.

On September 28, 1998, Liberty Media announced the formation of Liberty Interactive, a company which would take advantage of new technologies such as set-top boxes to develop interactive programming. The company would own 86% of TCI Music Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: TUNE/TUNEP). E! Entertainment President and CEO Lee Masters would become the new company&#x27;s CEO, and Bruce Ravenel would be chief technology officer.

On June 2, 1999, Liberty announced that it would acquire the Associated Group for $2.8 billion.

On September 10, 1999, Liberty Media Group renamed TCI Music to Liberty Digital Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: LDIG), with the new company trading on NASDAQ&#x27;s National Market tier, after Liberty Media traded most of its Internet content, interactive television assets, and rights to provide AT&amp;T&#x27;s cable systems with interactive services, in addition to cash and notes valued at $150 million, for TCI Music stock. Masters, who became Liberty Digital&#x27;s CEO, told &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that the new company had a value of $1 billion, $650 million of that from the interactive unit of Liberty Media, which had also used the name Liberty Digital. Liberty Digital lost $244 million with revenue of $66 million in 1999, thanks to investments in struggling Internet businesses homegrocer.com, drugstore.com, TiVo and iVillage. In August 2000, the company bought a 50% stake in the Game Show Network because of its interactive features.

On December 17, 1999, TCI Satellite Entertainment Inc. (TSAT), based in Englewood, Colorado, announced that Liberty Media was trading its interest in Sprint PCS for $300 million in TCI Satellite preferred stock. A new company, 90% owned by Liberty Media and 10% owned by TCI Satellite, would combine the satellite-related businesses and take advantage of the growing area of Internet content. Liberty Media President and CEO Robert R. Bennett said the deal would benefit stockholders of both companies. Another new company, Liberty Livewire, was formed from Todd-AO and two other companies by Liberty Media, which provided audio and video post-production services. David Beddow of TCI became CEO.

=== 2000–present ===
Liberty Media&#x27;s Discovery Channel and QVC continued to do well, but the newer projects had problems and the company&#x27;s stock price dropped by half. If AT&amp;T agreed to spin off Liberty Media, new deals such as a possible News Corp. purchase of DirecTV would be easier because AT&amp;T would no longer require federal approval to complete such deals. Liberty Media was spun off from AT&amp;T on August 10, 2001. This was one of three possible actions to ensure federal approval of AT&amp;T&#x27;s $54 billion acquisition of MediaOne Group—the others were selling its 25.5% share of Time Warner Entertainment and dropping 11.8 million cable customers. Also in 2001, Liberty Media acquired the remainder of Liberty Digital and Liberty Satellite &amp; Technology (formerly TCI Satellite). Both companies were independent spinoffs of TCI, though Liberty already owned 90% of both companies after the exchange for Sprint PCS stock. Being independent increased their asset values, but the stock prices of both dropped, negating any benefits.

In June 2002, Liberty Media acquired Wink Communications, a maker of set-top boxes founded by Brian P. Dougherty (of GEOS fame), for $100 million. Liberty Media subsequently spent $5 billion on nine German regional cable networks. Apart from television distribution it held major interests in other groups. For example, it was the largest shareholder in News Corporation (though the founding Murdoch family owns more voting shares), and had a 4% stake in Time Warner. In June 2005, Liberty Media International combined with UnitedGlobalCom, creating Liberty Global. In May 2006, Time Warner acquired Liberty Media&#x27;s 50% stake in Court TV, for $735 million. On May 16, 2006, IDT sold its IDT Entertainment division to Liberty Media &quot;for all of Liberty Media&#x27;s interests in IDT, $186 million in cash and the assumption of existing indebtedness&quot;. IDT Entertainment&#x27;s assets and Starz Entertainment Group&#x27;s line of premium television channels combined to produce content for all distribution platforms, and IDT Entertainment was later renamed as Starz Media.

Liberty negotiated an asset swap with News Corp. and Time Warner that would give it control of DirecTV and the Atlanta Braves baseball team. On February 12, 2007, the deal was completed with Time Warner wherein Liberty would receive the Atlanta Braves and a group of craft magazines, along with $1 billion in cash in exchange for 60 million shares of Time Warner stock (valued at $1.27 billion as of market close on February 12, 2007). The deal was approved by Major League Baseball and then completed on May 16, 2007. On February 20, 2008, the Federal Communications Commission approved the exchange of 16.3% of News Corp. for 38.4% of DirecTV, an $11 billion deal that also gave Liberty sports networks in Denver, Pittsburgh and Seattle plus $550 million in cash.

In April 2007, Liberty completed a purchase of Green Bay, Wisconsin, television station WFRV-TV, and satellite station WJMN-TV in Escanaba, Michigan, which serves the Marquette, Michigan, market. The deal was part of a swap of 7.59 million shares of common stock in CBS, the stations&#x27; owner, that was held by Liberty Media; in exchange for the stock, CBS gave Liberty the stations and $170 million in cash. Liberty announced plans in April 2011 to sell WFRV and WJMN to Nexstar Broadcasting Group for $20 million.

On September 3, 2008, Liberty Media decided to initiate the process of spinning off Liberty Entertainment to Liberty Media shareholders, leaving Malone with a majority ownership of the new company. On May 4, 2009, The DirecTV Group Inc. said it would become a part of Liberty&#x27;s entertainment unit, part of which would then be spun off as a separate company called DirecTV. The new company would also acquire Liberty&#x27;s 100% interests in the three FSN networks and its 50% interest in GSN. The rest of the unit would be traded as Liberty Starz. Liberty would increase its share of DirecTV from 48 to 54%, with Malone and his family owning 24%. On May 4, 2009, Liberty announced that it would split off Liberty Entertainment, Inc., a subsidiary owning the three Fox Sports Net (FSN) channels (now Root Sports) acquired under the swap with News Corp. and Liberty&#x27;s 65% interest in GSN, into a separate company that would merge with The DirecTV Group, reducing Liberty owner John Malone&#x27;s stake in DirecTV to 24%. The merger was completed on November 19, 2009, with The DirecTV Group and Liberty Entertainment becoming subsidiaries of a new company named DirecTV.

On February 17, 2009, Liberty announced that it would invest up to $530 million into the struggling Sirius XM Radio Inc., in a structured deal that would help the satellite radio provider avoid filing bankruptcy protection by meeting its obligations. The deal provided two board seats for Liberty Media, and provided cash for operations and development, with a maturity date of December 2012 for the loan. On March 6, the two companies approved the second part of the deal, with Sirius XM getting $250 million immediately and Liberty receiving 12.5 million shares of preferred stock convertible into a 40% ownership of Sirius XM common stock. On June 16, 2010, Malone exchanged his preferred stock in DirecTV with equivalent amounts of common stock, reducing his voting interest in the company from 24% to 3%, with Malone resigning as chairman and ending his managerial role at DirecTV. That same year, Liberty Media announced that it would spin off Liberty Starz and Liberty Capital and keep Liberty Interactive. The spinoff took the name Liberty CapStarz, but renamed itself Liberty Media in 2011. On the Fortune 500 list 2011, Liberty Media was ranked 224, moving up from 2010 when they were ranked 227.

In May 2011, Liberty announced it was in talks to buy the Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore chain for $1.02 billion. It eventually bought a 16% stake in the form of preferred stock in Barnes &amp; Noble for $204 million. On August 8, 2012, Liberty Media announced that it would spin off Starz into a separate publicly traded company. The spin-off of Starz Inc. was completed on January 15, 2013. The company agreed in March 2013 to pay $2.62 billion for 27.3% of Charter Communications from Apollo Global Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Crestview Partners with the provision that Liberty would not increase its stake past 35% until after January 2016 but no more than 39.99%. By May 1, Liberty completed the transaction and placed four directors on Charter&#x27;s board.

In 2014, Liberty Media spun off TruePosition and its holdings in Charter Communications into a new company, Liberty Broadband. In late 2016, Liberty Media agreed to buy the Formula One Group for US$4.4 billion (£3.3 billion). The deal was finalized in January 2017 for a total of US$4.6 billion (£3.44 billion). 

On November 17, 2022, Liberty Media announced that it would split off the Atlanta Braves and its associated real estate development project, and create a new Liberty Live Group tracking stock to hold Liberty&#x27;s 35% stake in Live Nation. Liberty Media acquired ticket distributor and hospitality group QuintEvents for $313 million in September 2023.

In December 2023, Liberty Media and SiriusXM agreed to create a new public company, &quot;New SiriusXM&quot;, which will continue to operate under the name and brand SiriusXM. It gained simplified ownership structure and greater strategic flexibility.

On April 1, 2024, Liberty Media announced its planned acquisition of 86% of Dorna Sports, which own MotoGP and WSBK.

== Divisions ==
Liberty has issued tracking stocks for each of the three divisions, and each tracking stock is in three individual series (A, B and C) having individual voting rights, meaning that the company&#x27;s common stock trades under nine individual stock symbols. Seven of the nine are listed on the Nasdaq stock market and two trade over the counter.

== Controversies ==
Liberty Media has come under pressure from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), thanks to GCI company, an Alaskan subsidiary of Liberty Broadband. GCI is a corporate sponsor of the Iditarod, an Alaskan dogsledding race that has lost multiple participants and sponsorships over the years. More than a dozen companies, including ExxonMobil, Alaska Airlines, and Chrysler, have dropped their Iditarod sponsorships over the years, amidst campaign efforts from PETA showing the conditions endured by dogs during and between races. Animal advocates have made pleas to Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei to end GCI’s Iditarod sponsorship. Maffei has not released a statement on GCI’s sponsorship. According to PETA, more than 150 dogs have died while running the Iditarod, and that number does not include dogs they say are killed during the off-season because they aren’t fast or fit enough.

<doc id="523913" wikidata="Q333689" url="?curid=523913" title="Ronnie Fearn, Baron Fearn">
<text>Ronald Cyril Fearn, Baron Fearn, (6 February 1931 – 24 January 2022) was a British Liberal Democrat politician. He was born and died in Southport.

==Early life==
Fearn was born in 1931 in Southport, the son of James (a master decorator) and Martha Ellen ( Hodge) Fearn. His birth was registered without his middle name in the Ormskirk registration district of Lancashire. Southport is now part of Merseyside.

Educated at King George V Grammar School, Southport, Fearn was a banker by profession, becoming a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Bankers. He worked as a banker with Williams Deacons Bank, Williams &amp; Glyn&#x27;s Bank, and later the Royal Bank of Scotland.

==Political career==
Fearn was the Liberal and later Liberal Democrat MP for Southport from 1987 to 1992 and 1997 to 2001, after unsuccessfully contesting the seat at the four 1970s general elections. He was the Lib. Dem. spokesman on health and tourism (1988–89), on local government (1989–90), and on transport, housing and tourism (1990–92). In Parliament, he was a member of the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport from 1997 to 2001.

Fearn served from 1974 until 2016 as a Sefton Metropolitan Borough councillor, having been a member of its predecessor body, Merseyside County Council. He thus achieved over 50 years of continuous service, being first elected as a Liberal and then for its successor party, the Liberal Democrats. Fearn first contested the borough at the inaugural elections of 1973 as a candidate for the Southport ward of Craven-Sussex-Talbot, in which he topped the poll, receiving more votes than the two other Liberal candidates elected alongside him.

In 1982, Fearn was elected as a Liberal-SDP candidate for the Norwood ward, again topping the poll. In 1990, he was elected for the Social and Liberal Democrats, and four years later, as a Liberal Democrat: the latter party had succeeded those he had previously represented. At every single Sefton election he contested, Fearn was top of the results, including those in which multiple candidates were elected.

He received a life peerage and joined the House of Lords as Baron Fearn, of Southport in the County of Merseyside, in 2001. He retired from the House on 11 July 2018.

==Honours==
In the 1985 Birthday Honours, Fearn was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

==Personal life==
In 1955, Fearn married Joyce Edna Dugan; they had a son, Martin, and a daughter. Martin became a mathematics teacher at Cowley International College, St. Helens. Outside of politics, Fearn listed his recreations as badminton, amateur dramatics and athletics. He lived in Southport.

Fearn died in Southport on 24 January 2022, at the age of 90.

<doc id="523920" wikidata="Q315003" url="?curid=523920" title="Hector Malot">
<text>Hector-Henri Malot (Hector Malot) (; 20 May 1830 – 18 July 1907) was a French writer born in La Bouille, Seine-Maritime. He studied law in Rouen and Paris, but eventually literature became his passion. He worked as a dramatic critic for &quot;Lloyd Francais&quot; and as a literary critic for &quot;L&#x27;Opinion Nationale&quot;.

His first book, published in 1859, was &quot;Les Amants&quot;. In total Malot wrote over 70 books. By far his most famous book is &quot;Sans Famille&quot; (&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Boy&quot;, 1878), which deals with the travels of the young orphan Remi, who is sold to the street musician Vitalis at age 8. &quot;Sans Famille&quot; gained fame as a children&#x27;s book, though it was not originally intended as such.

== Personal life ==

=== Birth ===
Hector Malot&#x27;s parents are Marie-Anne-Victoire Le Bourgeois and Jean Baptiste Malot. They married September 30, 1826, each for the second time.

From the union was born first a child named Victor who died at a young age. On May 20, 1830 Hector was born in the family home of La Bouille, on the banks of the Seine.

A few hours after his birth, a sailboat moored in front of the house suddenly veers dangerously towards it. It breaks the window of the newborn’s room with its bowsprit. When a crowd gathers they find the little Hector sleeping peacefully as if nothing happened, which is seen as an omen of an unusual destiny. 

=== Childhood and adolescence ===

==== From La Bouille to Bosc-Bénard-Commin ====
Hector spends the first years of his childhood in La Bouille. He observes the ships loading or unloading their cargoes, those leaving for distant destinations; he observes the passage of the ferry, the comings and goings of the stagecoaches, the customers of the inns, etc. 

In October 1835 Hector’s family leaves the banks of the Seine to settle in Bosc-Bénard-Commin in the department of Eure. This move follows Jean-Baptiste Malot’s transfer of his La Bouille study to his son-in-law. He becomes a justice of the peace for the canton of Bourgtheroulde. 

This new environment allows for Hector’s taste of reading. He stays locked up for hours devouring books, preferring to abandon his French lessons to read Racine, Lesage or even Molière. 

Hector begins to appreciate life in the countryside and indulges in numerous escapades during which he “discovered nature, the cycle of seasons and crops, became interested in trees, flowers, insects, animals..”. He developed a taste for nature and botany which would last his entire life.

==== Boarding school in Rouen ====
At age 9, given the poor progress Hector shows in his education, he’s sent to boarding school in Rouen by his father. Marie-Anne-Victoire does everything possible to delay this deadline, but Jean-Baptiste’s decision is final. Hector departs in October 1839. 

Hector arrives in Rouen at the Heudron and Lamardeley institute, attended mainly by the sons of well-off peasants and notables of the region. Here he befriends future literary critic Jules Levallois. 

Three years later, in 1842, Hector attends the Corneille high school in Rouen but hardly excels in his studies, suffering from a school system in which he feels he cannot express himself. He prefers history class, with a teacher he considers an original, free-spirited person.

=== Early writing and family life ===

==== Arrival in Paris ====
Hector Malot arrived in Paris in 1847 when he was 17 years old. he continued his studies there at the Condorcet high school where he obtained his baccalaureate after two years. In accordance with his father’s wishes, he began studying law which he continued for three years. However, in 1853, against the wishes of his father, he decided to abandon the legal path in order to devote himself to a literary career. 

In the years that followed, Hector tried in vain to have a first play performed. To ensure his livelihood, he wrote a few articles, notably in &quot;Journal pour tous&quot;, where Jules Simon hired him for his knowledge of botany. 

==== From Moisselles to Fontenay-sous-Bois ====
Busy on one hand with his work as a journalist and distracted on the other by Parisian life, Hector Malot found himself unable to advance the writing of his first novel. He therefore decided to retire to his parents, who left Normandy and settled in Moisselles, near Écouen, in Val-d’Oise. Back in the countryside he could devote himself entirely to his writing, resulting in his first novel, &quot;Les Amants.&quot; It was released in 1859 when Hector had become a journalist at &quot;L’Opinion notationale&quot; and enjoyed great success.

In October 1862, Marie-Anne-Victoire, Hector’s mother, dies. This loss upset the writer greatly. He later attempted to exorcise this episode through the writing of &quot;Romain Kalbris&quot;, a novel in which a dying mother awaits the return of her sailor son.

In 1865 Hector builds at 3 avenue de la Dame-Blanche in Fontenay-souls-Boris, a wooden chalet that he would live in until the end of his life. He chose the location with care and accuracy: at the intersection of avenue de la Dame-Blanche and avenue de Fontenay, near the station, facing the Boris de Vincennes. This to ensure he could regularly go to Paris or neighboring stations for the walks he enjoyed. 

His father, Jean-Baptiste, then a widower for almost two years, moved in and remained there until his death in October 1866. Shortly after, in 1867, Hector married Anna Dariès in Montgeron, with whom he has a daughter, Lucie in 1868. When Anna died in 1880, Hector remarried to Marthe Oudinot de La Faverie, age 31, with whom he made numerous trips. 

=== Publication of &quot;Sans Famille&quot; ===
In 1878 Hector Malot published his most famous work: &quot;Sans Famille&quot; (literal translation: Without Family but mostly known as &quot;Nobody’s Boy&quot;)&quot;.&quot; This novel tells the adventures of the foundling, Rémi, who is sold by his adoptive father to a street musician named Vitalis. Traveling the French and later English roads, Rémi works in different professions and meets many people before setting out to find his biological family. 

Hector Malot thought of and wrote this work for his daughter, Lucie. He begins the novel with a dedication to her. 

=== End of career and retirement ===
In 1887, the &quot;Journal de Rouen&quot; published in its daily edition the novel &quot;Ghislaine&quot; in serial form, paying homage to Malot’s Norman roots. 

In 1893, a year after writing &quot;En famille&quot; (loosely translated as &quot;Nobody’s Girl&quot;), Malot’s granddaughter Perrine was born, sharing the name of the heroine of the novel. He proves to be an attentive and loving grandfather, curious to note the development he observes of the child. 

In 1894 Malot published his last novel, &quot;Amours de vieux&quot;. He decides to put an end to his literary career and retire to his home in Fontenay-sous-Boris where he plans new trips. However, two years later, he publishes an autobiographical work, &quot;Les Romans de mes romans (The Novel of my Novels).&quot; He also wrote, shortly before his death, a text entitled &quot;Le Mousse,&quot; which would only appear posthumously in 1997. These last two works are dedicated to Perrine. 

Suffering from paralysis since 1905, Hector Malot died on July 18, 1907 in Fontenay-sous-Bois. He is buried there in the cemetery where he rests in the company of his first wife Anna, his father Jean-Baptiste, his daughter Lucie, his sister Prudence and his son-in-law, General Mesple.

*&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Boy: Remi&quot; (1977, 51 episodes, based on &quot;Sans Famille&quot;)
*&quot;The Story of Perrine&quot; (1978, 53 episodes, based on &quot;En Famille&quot;)
*&quot;Remi, Nobody&#x27;s Girl&quot; (1996, 26 episodes, based on &quot;Sans Famille&quot; with gender swap)
Sans Famille has been adapted into film in France numerous times throughout the years, most recently in the 2018 film &quot;Remi, Nobody’s Boy&quot; by Antoine Blossier.

<text>A flower box is a type of container in the form of a planter or box that is usually placed outdoors and used for displaying live plants and flowers, but it may also be used for growing herbs or other edible plants.

It is usually placed or affixed to an accessible location so the resident of a home may easily work with the plants in the container. A flower box may be installed under a window and supported in place by brackets on the wall below, in which case it may be called a window box. Flower boxes may also be used to line decks, patios, porches, steps, and sidewalks and they can even be hung from railings.

Wood, brick, metal, fiberglass and cellular PVC can all be used in flower box construction, with wood being a classical material of choice. A typical wooden container will last 3–5 years before showing signs of rot. With painting and maintenance, they can sometimes last 10–15 years. Fiberglass has the advantage of being lightweight and insect proof. PVC is a plastic that is a rot proof alternative to wood, and is often used on homes to prevent rot or siding damage.

Sometimes, a box is placed inside a kitchen window in order to grow herbs or other supplies for a chef as an easily accessed miniature kitchen garden.

J. Linderski has argued that Pliny described flower boxes in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;, at 19.59. However, Linderski could only find one other allusion to this practice in Martial 11.18.

<doc id="523926" wikidata="Q730485" url="?curid=523926" title="Grassmann's law">
<text>Grassmann&#x27;s law, named after its discoverer Hermann Grassmann, is a dissimilatory phonological process in Ancient Greek and Sanskrit which states that if an aspirated consonant is followed by another aspirated consonant in the next syllable, the first one loses the aspiration. The descriptive version was given for Sanskrit by Pāṇini.

Here are some examples in Greek of the effects of Grassmann&#x27;s law:

* &#x27;I sacrifice (an animal)&#x27;; &#x27;it was sacrificed&#x27;
* &#x27;hair&#x27;; &#x27;hairs&#x27;
* &#x27;to bury (present)&#x27;; &#x27;a grave&#x27;

In reduplication, which forms the perfect tense in both Greek and Sanskrit, if the initial consonant is aspirated, the prepended consonant is unaspirated by Grassmann&#x27;s law. For instance &#x27;I grow&#x27; : &#x27;I have grown&#x27;.

The fact that deaspiration in Greek took place after the change of Proto-Indo-European to (PIE &quot;*bʰn̥ǵʰús&quot; &gt; (&quot;pakhús&quot;) not &quot;bakhús&quot; but Sanskrit (&quot;bahú&quot;)) and the fact that all other Indo-European languages do not apply Grassmann&#x27;s law both suggest that it was developed separately in Greek and Sanskrit (although quite possibly by areal influence spread across a then-contiguous Graeco-Aryan–speaking area) and so it was not inherited from Proto-Indo-European.

Also, Grassmann&#x27;s law in Greek also affects the aspirate &lt; developed specifically in Greek but not in Sanskrit or most other Indo-European. (For example, &gt; &gt; &quot;I have&quot;, with dissimilation of , but the future tense &gt; &quot;I will have&quot; was unaffected, as aspiration was lost before .) The evidence from other languages is not strictly negative: many branches, including Sanskrit&#x27;s closest relative, Iranian, merge the Proto-Indo-European voiced aspirated and unaspirated stops and so it is not possible to tell if Grassmann&#x27;s law ever operated in them.

According to Filip De Decker, Grassmann&#x27;s law had not operated in Mycenaean Greek yet, and it is almost certain that it occurred later than 1200 BC; it might even postdate the Homeric Greek period.

==In Greek==

In Koine Greek, in cases other than reduplication, alternations involving labials and velars have been completely levelled, and Grassmann&#x27;s law remains in effect only for the alternation between and , as in the last two examples above. (It makes no difference whether the in question continues Proto-Indo-European or .)

Thus, alongside the pair &#x27;fast&#x27; : &#x27;faster&#x27;, displaying Grassmann&#x27;s law, Greek has the pair &#x27;thick&#x27; : &#x27;thicker&#x27; from the Proto-Indo-European etymon (established by cognate forms like Sanskrit &#x27;abundant&#x27; since is the only point of intersection between Greek and Sanskrit ) in which the in the comparative is a result of levelling. Similarly, ~ &#x27;come to know&#x27; from PIE has the future . However, only dissimilates before aspirated affixes like the aorist passive in and the imperative in ; and do not, as in &#x27;speak!&#x27;.

==Diaspirate roots==
Cases like ~ and ~ illustrate the phenomenon of &quot;diaspirate roots&quot; for which two different analyses have been given.

In one account, the underlying diaspirate theory, the underlying roots are taken to be and . When an , a word edge, or various other sounds immediately follow, the second aspiration is lost, and the first aspirate therefore survives (, ). If a vowel follows the second aspirate, the second aspirate survives unaltered, and the first aspiration is thus lost by Grassmann&#x27;s law (, ).

A different analytical approach was taken by the Indian grammarians. They took the roots to be underlying and . The roots persist unaltered in and . If an follows, it triggers an aspiration throwback and the aspiration migrates leftward, docking onto the initial consonant (, ).

In his initial formulation of the law, Grassmann briefly referred to aspiration throwback to explain the seemingly aberrant forms. However, the consensus among contemporary historical linguists is that the former explanation (underlying representation) is the correct one, as aspiration throwback would require multiple root shapes for the same basic root in different languages whenever an aspirate follows in the next syllable ( for Sanskrit, for Greek, for Proto-Germanic and Proto-Italic which have no dissimilation), but the underlying diaspirate allows for a single root shape, with for all languages.

In the later course of Sanskrit, under the influence of the grammarians, aspiration throwback was applied to original mono-aspirate roots by analogy. Thus, from the verb root (&#x27;to plunge&#x27;), the desiderative stem is formed by analogy with the forms (a desiderative form) and (a nominal form, both from the root &#x27;to be awake&#x27;, originally Proto-Indo-European ).

The linguist Ivan Sag has pointed out an advantage of the ancient Indian theory: it explains why there are no patterns like hypothetical ~ , which are not ruled out by the underlying diaspirate theory. However, aspiration fails to account for reduplication patterns in roots with initial aspirates, such as Greek &#x27;I put&#x27;, with an unaspirated reduplicated consonant. Aspiration throwback thus needs to be enhanced with a stipulation that aspirates reduplicate as their unaspirated counterparts. From a diachronic standpoint, the absence of these patterns in Greek is explained by the Proto-Indo-European constraint against roots of the form .

==Other languages==
Processes similar to Grassmann&#x27;s law continue to work in Middle Indo-Aryan, although it tends to be inconsistent regarding direction, for example Sanskrit (skandha&quot;) → khandha&quot; → Assamese (&quot;kandh&quot;), but (&quot;bhraṣṭa&quot;) → &quot;bhaṭṭha&quot; → (&quot;bhata&quot;).

A process similar to Grassmann&#x27;s law is also known to occur in Ofo, an extinct and underdocumented Siouan language. The law is found in compounds such as the following:

* &quot;óskha&quot; (&#x27;the crane&#x27;) + &quot;afháⁿ&quot; (&#x27;white&#x27;) → &quot;oskạfha&quot; (&#x27;the white egret&#x27;)

A similar phenomenon occurs in Meitei (a Tibeto-Burman language) in which an aspirated consonant is deaspirated if preceded by an aspirated consonant (including ) in the previous syllable. The deaspirated consonants are then voiced between sonorants.

* (&#x27;pierce&#x27;) + (&#x27;upward&#x27;) → (&#x27;pierce upwards&#x27;)
* (&#x27;cow&#x27;) + (&#x27;udder&#x27;) → (&#x27;milk&#x27;)
* (&#x27;trim&#x27;) + (&#x27;outward&#x27;) → (&#x27;trim outwards&#x27;)

Hadza, spoken in Northern Tanzania, exhibits Grassmann&#x27;s law in its lexicon, but most obviously in reduplication:
: &#x27;look at each other&#x27;, from &#x27;look&#x27;
In Hadza, has no effect on aspiration.

A similar effect takes place in Koti and other Makhuwa languages, where it was dubbed &quot;Katupha&#x27;s law&quot; in Schadeberg (1999). If two aspirated consonants are brought together in one stem, the first loses its aspiration. The effect is particularly clear in reduplicated words: &quot;kopikophi&quot; &#x27;eyelash&#x27;; &quot;piriphiri&quot; &#x27;pepper&#x27; (cf. Swahili &#x27;piripiri&#x27;); &quot;okukuttha&quot; &#x27;to wipe&#x27;. This is slightly different from in Greek and Sanskrit, in that the two syllables need not be adjacent.

The four Salishan languages Salish–Spokane–Kalispel, Okanagan, Shuswap and Tillamook exhibit a similar process affecting ejective rather than aspirated consonants, which has been called &quot;Grassmann&#x27;s law for Salish&quot;, for example Shuswap underlying &#x27;crutches&#x27; → surface .

<text>The Chinese Eastern Railway or CER (, , or , &quot;Kitaysko-Vostochnaya Zheleznaya Doroga&quot; or &quot;KVZhD&quot;), is the historical name for a railway system in Northeast China (also known as Manchuria).

The Russian Empire constructed the line from 1897 to 1902. The Railway was a concession to Russia, and later the Soviet Union, granted by the Qing dynasty government of Imperial China. The system linked Chita with Vladivostok in the Russian Far East and with Port Arthur, then an Imperial Russian leased ice-free port. The T-shaped line consisted of three branches:

* the western branch, now the Harbin–Manzhouli Railway
* the eastern branch, now the Harbin–Suifenhe Railway
* the southern branch, now part of the Beijing–Harbin Railway

which intersected in Harbin. Saint Petersburg administered the railway and the concession, known as the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone, from the city of Harbin, which grew into a major rail-hub.

The southern branch of the CER, known as the Japanese South Manchuria Railway from 1906, became a locus and partial &quot;casus belli&quot; for the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, the 1929 Sino-Soviet Conflict, and the Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937–1945. The Soviet Union sold the railway to the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo in 1935; later in 1945 the Soviets regained co-ownership of the railway by treaty. The Soviet Union returned the Chinese Eastern Railway to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1952.

== Name ==
The official Chinese name of this railway was Great Qing Eastern Provinces Railway (), also known as Eastern Qing Railway () or Eastern Provinces Railway(). After the Xinhai Revolution, the northern branches was renamed to Chinese Eastern Provinces Railway () in 1915, shortened form as ().

The southern branch was renamed to South Manchuria Railway (Japanese kyujitai/) after Japanese took over from Russians in 1905.

It is also known in English as the Chinese Far East Railway, Trans-Manchurian Railway and North Manchuria Railway.

== History ==


The Chinese Eastern Railway, a single-track line, provided a shortcut for the world&#x27;s longest railroad, the Trans-Siberian Railway, from near the Siberian city of Chita, across northern Manchuria via Harbin to the Russian port of Vladivostok. This route drastically reduced the travel distance required along the originally proposed main northern route to Vladivostok, which lay completely on Russian soil but was not completed until a decade after the Manchurian &quot;shortcut&quot;.

In 1896 China granted a construction concession through northern Manchuria under the supervision of Vice Minister of Public Works Xu Jingcheng. Work on the CER began in July 1897 along the line Tarskaya (east of Chita) — Hailar — Harbin — Nikolsk-Ussuriski, and accelerated drastically after Russia concluded a 25-year lease of Liaodong from China in 1898. Officially, traffic on the line started in November 1901, but regular passenger traffic from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok across the Trans-Siberian railway did not commence until July 1903.

In 1898, construction of a 550-mile (880 km) spur line, most of which later formed the South Manchuria Railway, began at Harbin, leading southwards through Eastern Manchuria, along the Liaodong Peninsula, to the ice-free deep-water port at Lüshun, which Russia was fortifying and developing into a first-class strategic naval base and marine coaling station for its Far East Fleet and Merchant Marine. This town was known in the west as Port Arthur, and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) was fought largely over who would possess this region and its excellent harbor, as well as whether it would remain open to traders of all nations (Open Door Policy).

The Chinese Eastern Railway was essentially completed in 1902, a few years earlier than the stretch around Lake Baikal. Until the Circumbaikal portion was completed (1904–1905; double-tracked, 1914), goods carried on the Trans-Siberian Railway had to be trans-shipped by ferry almost a hundred kilometers across the lake (from Port Baikal to Mysovaya).

The Chinese Eastern Railway became important in international relations. After the first Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895, Russia gained the right to build the Chinese Eastern Railway in Manchuria. They had a large army and occupied Northern Manchuria, which was of some concern to the Japanese. Russia wanted the railway badly. It loaned money to China and promised to use the proposed railway to help defend China against Japan, in the secret Li–Lobanov Treaty of 1896. Construction started in 1898 and was completed in 1903.

In 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion – which was suppressed by the Eight Nation Alliance including Russia – Russia also launched a separate invasion of Manchuria sending 100,000 troops to protect their interests in the railroad. During the Russo-Japanese War, Russia lost both the Liaodong Peninsula and much of the South Manchurian branch to Japan. The rail line from Changchun to Lüshun — transferred to Japanese control — became the South Manchuria Railway.

During the Russian Civil War (1917–1924) the Russian part of the CER came under the administration of the White Army. From the 1919 Karakhan Manifesto to 1927, diplomats of the Soviet Union would promise to revoke concessions in China, but the Soviets secretly kept tsarist concessions such as the Chinese Eastern Railway, as well as consulates, barracks, and Orthodox churches. This led Chiang Kai-Shek — who pushed foreign powers such as Britain to return some of their concessions from 1925 to 1927 — to turn against his former Soviet ally in 1927, seizing Soviet legations. The Soviets would later fight an armed conflict to keep control over the northern CER in the Sino-Soviet conflict of 1929. while Japan maintained control of the southern spur line.

After the establishment of Manchukuo it was known as the North Manchuria Railway until 23 March 1935, when the USSR sold its rights to the railway to the Manchukuo government; it was then merged into the Manchukuo National Railway and converted to standard gauge in four hours on 31 August.

From August 1945, the CER again came under the joint control of the USSR and China. After World War II the Soviet government insisted on occupying the Liaodong Peninsula but allowed joint control over the Southern branch with China; all this together received the name of the &quot;Chinese Changchun Railway&quot; ().

In 1952, the Soviet Union transferred (free of charge) all of its rights to the Chinese Changchun Railway to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== Flags ==
The flag of the Chinese Eastern Railway is a combination of Chinese and Russian flags. It changed several times with the political changes of both owners. The first CER flag (1897–1915) was a combination of the triangular version of the flag of the Qing dynasty and the flag of Russia, with &quot;East Provinces Railway of Great Qing&quot; () in Chinese. The 1915–1925 flag replaced the flag of the Qing dynasty with a triangular version of the five-colored flag, with &quot;East Provinces Railway Company of China&quot; () in Chinese. The flag was changed again in 1925 and 1932, with the flag of the Soviet Union and the flag of Manchukuo added.
== Fleet ==
The only train that covers the entire route is the train #19/20 &quot;Vostok&quot; (translated as &quot;East&quot;) Moscow — Beijing. The trip from Moscow to Beijing takes 146 hours (6 days, 2 hours). The journey in the opposite direction lasts 143 hours (5 days, 23 hours).

There is also a train #653/654 Zabaikalsk — Manzhouli which one can use to cross the Russian-Chinese border. The trip takes 25 minutes.

<text>Louis-Marie Stanislas Fréron (; 17 August 1754 – 15 July 1802) was a French politician, journalist, representative to the National Assembly, and a representative on mission during the French Revolution.

==Background==
The son of Elie-Catherine Fréron, he was born in Paris to a wealthy family. His father was a prominent journalist and popular opponent of the philosophes and encyclopédistes, his most notable opponent being Voltaire (who openly considered Elie his enemy), and it is surmised that his father&#x27;s history of conflict with the state over freedom of the press heavily influenced Louis Fréron&#x27;s political views. He attended the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, where his father held a faculty position, together with the likes of Maximilien Robespierre and Camille Desmoulins. On the death of his father, he inherited &quot;L&#x27;Année littéraire&quot;, which was continued until 1795 and edited successively by the abbé Royou and Julien Louis Geoffroy.

==Early Revolutionary activities==
Though due to legal obligations he still had some affiliation with &quot;L&#x27;Année littéraire&quot;, Fréron took up writing and editing his paper &quot;L&#x27;Orateur du Peuple&quot;. In it, he wrote radical denunciations of counter-revolutionaries much like those written by Jean-Paul Marat and Camille Desmoulins, and in fact the three of them aided each other in editing their papers. His first real taste of rabble-rousing came in the form of collaboration with Desmoulins to incite the storming of the Bastille.

Soon after, he was elected as representative to the Bonne-Nouvelle district of the newly formed Paris Commune, where it seems he was minimally active before returning to his role as a journalist. He acted as a collaborator for &quot;L’Ami des citoyens&quot; for a brief period before starting his own paper &quot;L&#x27;Orateur du Peuple&quot;, under the pseudonym Martel, which consisted of 8 pages and was distributed every other day, with Marcel Enfantin serving as editor. Aside from his writings in his paper, he openly collaborated with Marat and agreed to fund and write half of Desmoulins paper.

In June 1790, Marcel Enfantin was arrested for &quot;provable conspiracy against liberty&quot; because the authorities believed him to be Martel. In response, Fréron wrote:
:Citizens, can you believe it? The Orateur du peuple is in chains! He had only taken up the pen in defense of your rights, he was a dynamic writer of the most ardent patriotism…he fought the ministerial hydra with a club, and the aristocracy with ridicule…Well, the Municipality has slandered [his] intentions…it has poisoned his innocent phrases…[but] the voice the Orateur du peuple will pierce the vaults of his prison…the articles of the Rights of Man were made to be used by this French citizen…so that he may publish his opinions.

Also, Fréron&#x27;s relationship with Desmoulins brought him to the cause of the Cordeliers and prompted his involvement with the attack on Tuileries palace of 1792 (the insurrection of the Paris crowds against the House of Bourbon, and their battle with the Swiss Guards).

In September, Fréron was elected to the National Convention for the &quot;département&quot; of Seine, and voted in favor of Louis XVI&#x27;s execution. Fréron served as a Représentant en mission to Provence, Marseilles, and Toulon between 1793 and 1794 together with Paul Barras.

===Siege of Toulon===
He was charged with establishing the Convention&#x27;s authority in the south during the Toulon rebellion. Fréron remained infamous as an enforcer of the Reign of Terror but came into contact with Napoleon Bonaparte, still just a young artillery officer, who had been stationed there. Augustin Robespierre and Antoine Christophe Saliceti, two representatives on mission, responded favourably to Napoleon&#x27;s request (bypassing his commander, Jean François Carteaux) to seize the peninsula fort from the British and install artillery on a promontory overlooking the bay in order to fire on the British fleet at anchor. An infantry attack led by Bonaparte was repelled, due chiefly to Carteaux lowering the number of men allocated to Napoleon for the attack. Fréron, despite quarrelling with Bonaparte and threatening him with execution, eventually gave him his backing against Carteaux. He subsequently attempted to curtail Napoleon&#x27;s career by insuring he would not command another larger attack on the British fort that was being planned, posting him to command the reserves instead. However, as this new attack faltered, Napoleon led the reserves forward without orders and seized the British fort.

Napoleon had previously introduced Fréron to his sister Pauline Bonaparte with whom he had a relationship until Pauline was married off to General Charles Leclerc in 1797.

==Reaction and the Directory==
Nonetheless, both he and Barras joined the Thermidorian Reaction in its clash with Robespierre; &quot;L&#x27;Orateur du Peuple&quot; became the mouthpiece of anti-Jacobins, and Fréron incited the Muscadins to attack the sans-culottes with clubs. He brought about the accusation of Antoine Fouquier-Tinville, and of Jean-Baptiste Carrier, and the arrest of the last Montagnards. Being sent by the Directory on a mission of peace to Marseilles he published in 1796 &quot;Mémoire historique sur la réaction royale et sur les malheurs du midi&quot; (&quot;Historical Dissertation on the Royalist Reaction and the Misfortunes of the South&quot;).

He was elected to the Council of the Five Hundred, but not allowed to take his seat. Failing as suitor for the hand of Pauline Bonaparte, in 1801 he was sent by Napoleon, now first consul, to Saint Domingue and died there from yellow fever in 1802.

General Charles Leclerc, who had married Pauline Bonaparte, also received a command in Saint Domingue in 1801 (during the last stage of the Haitian Revolution), and died the same year.

<text>Sherrill Milnes (born January 10, 1935) is an American dramatic baritone most famous for his Verdi roles. From 1965 until 1997 he was associated with the Metropolitan Opera. His voice is a high dramatic baritone, combining good legato with an incisive rhythmic style.

By 1965, aged 30, he had made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera. His international debuts followed soon thereafter, and Milnes became one of the world&#x27;s prominent Verdi baritones of the 1970s and 1980s.

==Early life==

Milnes was born in Downers Grove, Illinois. His mother and father were dairy farmers. As a child, he exhibited strong and varied musical talents. In addition to singing, he also played piano, violin, viola, double bass, clarinet, and tuba. Although his interests did not always lean toward opera, he spent many hours singing to his father&#x27;s cows and was once found on a tractor practicing an operatic laugh.

While in high school, Milnes planned to be an anesthesiologist, but later returned to music, studying music education at Drake University and Northwestern University, with the idea of becoming a teacher. He attended North Central College before transferring to Drake University and Northwestern University.

From 1958 until 1963, he was a member of the Chicago Symphony Chorus under the direction of Margaret Hillis, performing several times under the baton of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s sixth music director, Fritz Reiner. After graduating from Drake, he spent a summer as an apprentice at the Santa Fe Opera and thereafter dedicated himself to becoming an opera singer, studying briefly with the famed soprano Rosa Ponselle.

Milnes was awarded an honorary doctorate from North Central College in 2006.

==Career==

Milnes began his career with the Opera Company of Boston in 1960, joining Boris Goldovsky&#x27;s Opera Theater, and debuting as Masetto in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. From very early on in his career, Milnes was managed by well-known talent manager Herbert Barrett. In 1961, he made his debut at Ponselle&#x27;s Baltimore Opera as Gérard in &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;.

In 1964, Milnes made his first major breakthrough singing the role of Valentin in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; at the New York City Opera (opposite Norman Treigle as Méphistophélès), the role with which he also made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1965. In 1967 he created the role of Captain Adam Brant in the world premiere of Marvin David Levy&#x27;s &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; at the Met.

In 1964, Milnes also made his European debut singing Figaro from &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; at the Teatro Nuovo in Milan. However, it was his performance as Miller in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Luisa Miller&quot; in 1968 which catapulted him into international fame.
Milnes was the leading baritone at the Met during the 1970s, singing to great acclaim there, especially for his performances in Verdi operas.

Beginning in 1982, Milnes experienced sudden serious vocal health problems which took him some time to surmount. In 1984, he sang in the world premiere of Act I of Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s opera &quot;Monna Vanna&quot;, which had been left in piano score by the composer and orchestrated by Igor Buketoff.

Milnes&#x27; talents were not confined, however, solely to the stage. As early as 1971 he had already received critical acclaim while featured in the role of David during the premier of Ezra Laderman&#x27;s opera &quot;And David Wept,&quot; on the CBS Television network, under the musical direction of Alfredo Antonini. Nearly a decade earlier in 1964 he also collaborated with Antonini, playing the role of Saint Joseph in a televised adaptation of Hector Berlioz&#x27;s sacred oratorio &quot;L&#x27;enfance du Christ&quot;.

Milnes was awarded Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity&#x27;s Charles E. Lutton Man of Music Award at its 1982 national convention in Urbana, Illinois. He had been initiated into the Fraternity&#x27;s Alpha Beta chapter at Drake University in 1954. In the same year was honored by the Italian government as &quot;Commendatore Ordine al Merito della Repubblica&quot;

On July 5, 1986, he performed on the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s tribute to the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty, which was televised live by ABC. The orchestra, conducted by Zubin Mehta, performed in Central Park.

In September 1996, Milnes was honored by the French government with the distinguished Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. After 32 years and 653 performances, he made his final appearance at the Metropolitan on March 22, 1997 as Amonasro in &quot;Aida&quot;.

In 1998, Milnes published a memoir, &quot;American Aria&quot;.

Milnes is currently a professor emeritus in voice at Northwestern University. He is a recipient of Yale University&#x27;s Sanford Medal.

Milnes was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State’s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 2003 in the area of The Performing Arts.

Milnes has been a resident of Cresskill, New Jersey, and currently resides in Palm Harbor, Florida with his wife and son, Theo.

==VOICExperience Foundation==
In 2001, Milnes and his wife, soprano Maria Zouves, founded the VOICExperience Foundation, a non-profit organization for the education of young singers. It evolved from a series of master classes led by Milnes, Tony Randall, Martina Arroyo and Barry Tucker, president of the Richard Tucker Music Foundation. Based in Florida, it provides several educational programs, workshops, outreach events and community enrichment programs. In Florida, the foundation runs The Florida VOICE Project for singers in the Tampa Bay Area. In New York City, the foundation runs the Opera As Drama program, a week-long career development program for emerging professional opera singers which culminates in a public performance at Opera America&#x27;s National Opera Center. As part of the Savannah Voice Festival, the foundation runs a Teen VOICE workshop and the Milnes VOICE studio.

<text>Deutsche Bank AG (, ) is a German multinational investment bank and financial services company headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany, and dual-listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange.

Deutsche Bank was founded in 1870 in Berlin. From 1929 to 1937, following its merger with Disconto-Gesellschaft, it was known as Deutsche Bank und Disconto-Gesellschaft or DeDi-Bank. Other transformative acquisitions have included those of Mendelssohn &amp; Co. in 1938, Morgan Grenfell in 1990, Bankers Trust in 1998, and Deutsche Postbank in 2010.

As of 2018, the bank&#x27;s network spanned 58 countries with a large presence in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. It is a component of the DAX stock market index and is often referred to as the largest German banking institution, with Deutsche Bank holding the majority stake in DWS Group for combined assets of 2.2 trillion euros, rivaling even Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe in terms of combined assets.

Deutsche Bank has been designated a global systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board since 2011. It has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.

According to a 2020 article in the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, Deutsche Bank had long had an &quot;abject&quot; reputation among major banks, as it has been involved in major scandals across various issue areas.

==History==


===1870–1933===

Deutsche Bank was founded in 1870 in Berlin as a specialist bank for financing foreign trade and promoting German exports. It subsequently played a large part in developing Germany&#x27;s financial services industry, as its business model focused on providing finance to industrial customers. The bank&#x27;s statute was adopted on 22 January 1870, and on 10 March 1870 the Prussian government granted it a banking license. The statute laid great stress on foreign business: Prior to the founding of Deutsche Bank, German importers and exporters were dependent upon British and French banking institutions in the world markets—a serious handicap in that German bills were almost unknown in international commerce, generally disliked and subject to a higher rate of a discount than English or French bills.

The founding members were: Hermann Zwicker (Bankhaus Gebr. Schickler, Berlin); Anton Adelssen (Bankhaus Adelssen &amp; Co., Berlin); Adelbert Delbrück (Bankhaus Delbrück, Leo &amp; Co.); Heinrich von Hardt (Hardt &amp; Co., Berlin, New York); Ludwig Bamberger (politician, former chairman of Bischoffsheim, Goldschmidt &amp; Co); Victor Freiherr von Magnus (Bankhaus F. Mart Magnus); (Bankhaus Deichmann &amp; Co., Cologne); Gustav Kutter (Bankhaus Gebrüder Sulzbach, Frankfurt); and Gustav Müller (Württembergische Vereinsbank, Stuttgart). The First directors were Wilhelm Platenius, Georg Siemens, and Hermann Wallich. Georg Siemens was a son of a cousin of Werner von Siemens. The bank initially operated from the first floor of a building at 21 Französische Strasse, then in 1871 moved to premises near the Berlin Stock Exchange, and in 1876 started building its massive head office complex on Mauerstrasse.

The bank&#x27;s first domestic branches, inaugurated in 1871 and 1872, were opened in Bremen and Hamburg. Its first overseas offices opened in Shanghai and Yokohama in 1872, and London in 1873, followed by South American offices between 1874 and 1886. The branch opening in London, after one failure and another partially successful attempt, was a prime necessity for the establishment of credit for the German trade in what was then the world&#x27;s money center. Deutsche Bank also took advantage of the Panic of 1873 by taking over a number of banks in liquidation, including the Berlin-based which had itself consolidated a number of failed banks in the early 1870s.

Major projects in the early years of the bank included the Northern Pacific Railroad in the US and the Baghdad Railway (1888). In Germany, the bank was instrumental in the financing of bond offerings of steel company Krupp (1879) and introduced the chemical company Bayer to the Berlin stock market.

The second half of the 1890s saw the beginning of a new period of expansion at Deutsche Bank. The bank formed alliances with large regional banks, giving itself an entry into Germany&#x27;s main industrial regions. It thus formed community-of-interests partnerships with in Elberfeld and in Breslau, linked to the fast-growing industrial economies of the Rhineland and Silesia respectively; it eventually acquired the two banks in 1914 and 1917 respectively. Joint ventures were symptomatic of the concentration then under way in the German banking industry. For Deutsche Bank, domestic branches of its own were still something of a rarity at the time; the Frankfurt branch dated from 1886 and the Munich branch from 1892, while further branches were established in Dresden and Leipzig in 1901.

In 1889, Deutsche Bank participated in the creation of the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank in Shanghai, in 1894, of the Banca Commerciale Italiana in Milan, and in 1898, of the Banque Internationale de Bruxelles.

In addition, the bank rapidly perceived the value of specialist institutions for the promotion of foreign business. Gentle pressure from the Foreign Ministry played a part in the establishment of Deutsche Überseeische Bank in 1886 and the stake taken in the newly established Deutsch-Asiatische Bank three years later, but the success of those companies showed that their existence made sound commercial sense. By end-1908, Deutsche was by far the largest German joint-stock bank by total deposits, with a total of 489 million Marks ahead of Dresdner Bank (225 million), Disconto-Gesellschaft (219 million), Darmstädter Bank (109 million) and A. Schaaffhausen&#x27;scher Bankverein (72 million). At that time, Deutsche Bank was referred to as one of the four &quot;D-Banks&quot; (all of which had names starting with a D) that dominated German commercial banking, together with Darmstädter Bank, Disconto-Gesellschaft, and Dresdner Bank.


During World War I and in its immediate aftermath, the operations of Deutsche Bank in Brussels, London, Tokyo and Yokohama were expropriated; conversely, its activity in the Ottoman Empire expanded considerably, and it greatly expanded its footprint in Germany. In 1919, the bank purchased the state&#x27;s share of Universum Film Aktiengesellschaft (UFA). In 1926, the bank assisted in the merger of Daimler and Benz.

The bank merged with Disconto-Gesellschaft in 1929 and rebranded itself Deutsche Bank und Disconto-Gesellschaft, sometimes referred to as DeDi-Bank. By 1930, Deutsche Bank &amp; Disconto-Gesellschaft maintained a similar dominant position as before World War I, with 4.8 billion Reichsmarks in total deposits ahead of Danat-Bank (2.4 billion), Dresdner Bank (2.3 billion), Commerz- und Privatbank (1.5 billion), Reichs-Kredit-Gesellschaft (619 million), and Berliner Handels-Gesellschaft (412 million).

In the crisis summer of 1931 the Deutsche Golddiskontbank, a subsidiary of the Reichsbank, acquired 35 percent of DeDi-Bank&#x27;s equity as part of a sector-wide rescue, bringing total government ownership of the bank to 38.5 percent. This did not, however, result in significant government interference in the management of the company, unlike at Dresdner Bank whose capital was near-completely nationalized.

===1933–1945===

When Adolf Hitler became leader of Germany, Deutsche Bank increasingly became integrated into the Nazi power structures, and fully implemented the Nazi policy of aryanization. In 1934 it dismissed its three Jewish management board members, Oscar Wassermann, Theodor Frank, and Georg Solmssen; in 1938 it dismissed its last Jewish supervisory board member. By the end of 1938, it had been involved as an intermediary and lender in at least 363 cases of expropriation of Jewish-owned businesses. In 1938, it acquired Jewish-controlled German bank Mendelssohn &amp; Co. under duress. Meanwhile, the Nazi government fully re-privatized Deutsche Bank in 1935–1937, largely out of budgetary considerations. Its name changed back to Deutsche Bank in 1937.

While the Nazi policies of financial repression were largely unhelpful to the domestic business of Deutsche and other German commercial banks, its expansionary behavior created opportunities that Deutsche Bank pursued. In 1938 following Hitler&#x27;s Anschluss of Austria, Deutsche Bank gradually took control of Creditanstalt-Bankverein, the former country&#x27;s leading bank. On the latter was coerced to enter a &quot;friendship agreement&quot; with Deutsche Bank, by which the latter secured a presence in its board of directors. Creditanstalt executive Louis de Rothschild was immediately arrested and imprisoned, deprived of his position and property, then released upon payment of $21,000,000, believed to have been the largest bail bond in history for any individual, and migrated to the U.S. in 1939 after more than one year in custody. Later in 1938, Creditanstalt was jointly taken over, without compensation, by German government holding , Deutsche Bank, and the Reichsbank, which held respectively 51 percent, 25 percent, and 12 percent of its capital. In April 1942, Deutsche Bank raised its ownership to 51 percent by acquiring a block of shares from VIAG. During wartime, the Creditanstalt expanded its operations into Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, and in Nazi-allied Bulgaria.

In September 1938, following the Munich Agreement, Deutsche Bank took over the branches of Prague-based Böhmische Union Bank (BUB) in the Sudetenland. In March 1939, it forcibly took over control of the BUB itself, in which it built a majority stake complemented with prior shareholding of Creditanstalt. It also took over management control of the National Bank of Greece during the Axis occupation of Greece, without however acquiring ownership out of consideration for Italian sensitivities. Through the Creditanstalt-Bankverein, Deutsche Bank also became a major shareholder of the (AJB), which had been formed in 1928 from the two former branches of the Wiener Bankverein in Belgrade and Zagreb, and of the Landesbank für Bosnien und Herzegowina in Sarajevo, together with the Société Générale de Belgique and its affiliate Banque Belge pour l&#x27;Étranger. In 1940, following the German invasion of Belgium, Deutsche Bank bought out the Belgian stake under duress and became the AJB&#x27;s dominant shareholder, with 88 percent held either directly or through Creditanstalt. Deutsche Bank simultaneously took control of the Landesbank in Sarajevo. Following the German invasion of Yugoslavia, the AJB was divided into two separate institutions, respectively the in occupied Serbia, and the in the Independent State of Croatia. Both these banks&#x27; assets were eventually confiscated by the newly established Communist authorities in October 1944, and they were subsequently liquidated.

During the war, Deutsche Bank provided banking facilities for the Gestapo and, through its branch in Katowice, loaned the funds used to build the Auschwitz camp and the nearby IG Farben facilities. Deutsche Bank publicly acknowledged its involvement at Auschwitz in 1999. It also was a principal participant in the Nazi regime&#x27;s gold transactions. Between 1942 and 1944, Deutsche Bank purchased 4,446 kg of gold from the Reichsbank, of which 744 kg came from Holocaust victims.

In an effort to come to terms with its past during the Nazi era, Deutsche Bank in 1995 published a history volume that detailed its entanglement with the dictatorship. In December 1999, along with other major German companies, Deutsche Bank contributed to a US$5.2 billion compensation fund following lawsuits brought by Holocaust survivors; U.S. officials had reportedly threatened to block Deutsche Bank&#x27;s $10 billion purchase of Bankers Trust if it did not contribute to the fund.

===1945–2000===

Following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the Allied authorities, in 1948, ordered Deutsche Bank&#x27;s break-up into regional banks. These regional banks were later consolidated into three major banks in 1952: Norddeutsche Bank AG; Süddeutsche Bank AG; and Rheinisch-Westfälische Bank AG. In 1957, these three banks merged to form Deutsche Bank AG with its headquarters in Frankfurt.

In 1959, the bank entered retail banking by introducing small personal loans. In the 1970s, the bank pushed ahead with international expansion, opening new offices in new locations, such as Milan (1977), Moscow, London, Paris, and Tokyo. In the 1980s, this continued when the bank paid U$603 million in 1986 to acquire Banca d&#x27;America e d&#x27;Italia.

In 1972, the bank established its &quot;Fiduciary Services Division&quot; which provides support to its private wealth division.

At 8:30 am on 30 November 1989, Alfred Herrhausen, chairman of Deutsche Bank, was killed when a car that he was in exploded while he was traveling in the Frankfurt suburb of Bad Homburg. The Red Army Faction claimed responsibility for the blast.

In 1989, the first steps towards creating a significant investment-banking presence were taken with the acquisition of Morgan, Grenfell &amp; Co., a UK-based investment bank which was renamed Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in 1994. In 1995 to greatly expand into international investments and money management, Deutsche Bank hired Edson Mitchell, a risk specialist from Merrill Lynch, who hired two other former Merrill Lynch risk specialists Anshu Jain and William S. Broeksmit. By the mid-1990s, the buildup of a capital-markets operation had got underway with the arrival of a number of high-profile figures from major competitors. Ten years after the acquisition of Morgan Grenfell, the US firm Bankers Trust was added. Bankers Trust suffered losses during the 1998 Russian financial crisis since it had a large position in Russian government bonds, but avoided financial collapse by being acquired by Deutsche Bank for $10 billion in November 1998. On 4 June 1999, Deutsche Bank merged its Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and Bankers Trust to became Deutsche Asset Management (DAM) with Robert Smith as the CEO. This made Deutsche Bank the fourth-largest money management firm in the world after UBS, Fidelity Investments, and the Japanese post office&#x27;s life insurance fund. At the time, Deutsche Bank owned a 12% stake in DaimlerChrysler but United States banking laws prohibit banks from owning industrial companies, so Deutsche Bank received an exception to this prohibition through 1978 legislation from Congress.

Deutsche continued to build up its presence in Italy with the acquisition in 1993 of Banca Popolare di Lecco from Banca Popolare di Novara for about $476 million. In 1999, it acquired a minority interest in Cassa di Risparmio di Asti.

===21st century===

In the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks the Deutsche Bank Building in Lower Manhattan, formerly Bankers Trust Plaza, was heavily damaged by the collapse of the South Tower of the World Trade Center. Demolition work on the 39-story building continued for nearly a decade, and was completed in early 2011.

In October 2001, Deutsche Bank was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This was the first NYSE listing after interruption due to 11 September attacks. The following year, Josef Ackermann became CEO of Deutsche Bank and served as CEO until 2012 when he became involved with the Bank of Cyprus. Then, beginning in 2002, Deutsche Bank strengthened its U.S. presence when it purchased Scudder Investments. Meanwhile, in Europe, Deutsche Bank increased its private-banking business by acquiring Rued Blass &amp; Cie (2002) and the Russian investment bank United Financial Group (2005) founded by the United States banker Charles Ryan and the Russian official Boris Fyodorov which followed Anshu Jain&#x27;s aggressive expansion to gain strong relationships with state partners in Russia. Jain persuaded Ryan to remain with Deutsche Bank at its new Russian offices and later, in April 2007, sent the president and chairman of the management board of VTB Bank Andrey Kostin&#x27;s son Andrey to Deutsche Bank&#x27;s Moscow office. Later, in 2008, to establish VTB Capital, numerous bankers from Deutsche Bank&#x27;s Moscow office were hired by VTB Capital. In Germany, further acquisitions of Norisbank, Berliner Bank and Deutsche Postbank strengthened Deutsche Bank&#x27;s retail offering in its home market. This series of acquisitions was closely aligned with the bank&#x27;s strategy of bolt-on acquisitions in preference to so-called &quot;transformational&quot; mergers. These formed part of an overall growth strategy that also targeted a sustainable 25% return on equity, something the bank achieved in 2005.

On 1 October 2003, Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank entered into a payment transaction agreement with Postbank to have Postbank process payments as the clearing center for the three banks.

Since the mid-1990s Deutsche Bank commercial real estate division offered Donald Trump financial backing, even though in the early 1990s Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover, Chemical, Bankers Trust, and 68 other entities refused to financially support him.

In 2008, Trump sued Deutsche Bank for $3 billion and a few years later, he shifted his financial portfolio from the investment banking division to Deutsche Bank private wealth division with Rosemary Vrablic, formerly of Citigroup, Bank of America, and Merrill Lynch, becoming Trump&#x27;s new personal banker at Deutsche Bank.

In 2007, the company&#x27;s headquarters, the Deutsche Bank Twin Towers building, was extensively renovated for three years, certified LEED Platinum and DGNB Gold.

In 2010, the bank developed and owned the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, after the casino&#x27;s original developer defaulted on its borrowings. Deutsche Bank ran it at a loss until its sale in May 2014. The bank&#x27;s exposure at the time of sale was more than $4 billion, and sold the property to Blackstone Group for $1.73 billion.

==== Housing credit bubble and CDO market ====

On 3 January 2014, it was reported that Deutsche Bank would settle a lawsuit brought by US shareholders, who had accused the bank of bundling and selling bad real estate loans before the 2008 downturn. This settlement came subsequent and in addition to Deutsche&#x27;s $1.93 billion settlement with the US Housing Finance Agency over similar litigation related to the sale of mortgage-backed securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

==== Leveraged super-senior trades ====
Former employees including Eric Ben-Artzi and Matthew Simpson have claimed that, during the crisis, Deutsche failed to recognize up to $12 billion of paper losses on its $130 billion portfolio of leveraged super senior trades, although the bank rejects the claims. A company document of May 2009 described the trades as &quot;the largest risk in the trading book&quot;, and the whistleblowers allege that had the bank accounted properly for its positions its capital would have fallen to the extent that it might have needed a government bailout. One of them claims that &quot;If Lehman Brothers didn&#x27;t have to mark its books for six months it might still be in business, and if Deutsche had marked its books it might have been in the same position as Lehman.&quot;

Deutsche had become the biggest operator in this market, which were a form of credit derivative designed to behave like the most senior tranche of a CDO. Deutsche bought insurance against default by blue-chip companies from investors, mostly Canadian pension funds, who received a stream of insurance premiums as income in return for posting a small amount of collateral. The bank then sold protection to US investors via the CDX credit index, the spread between the two was tiny but was worth $270m over the 7 years of the trade. It was considered very unlikely that many blue chips would have problems at the same time, so Deutsche required collateral of just 10% of the contract value.

The risk of Deutsche taking large losses if the collateral was wiped out in a crisis was called the gap option. Ben-Artzi claims that after modeling came up with &quot;economically unfeasible&quot; results, Deutsche accounted for the gap option first with a simple 15% &quot;haircut&quot; on the trades (described as inadequate by another employee in 2006) and then in 2008 by a $1–2bn reserve for the credit correlation desk designed to cover all risks, not just the gap option. In October 2008, it stopped modeling the gap option and just bought S&amp;P put options to guard against further market disruption, but one of the whistleblowers has described this as an inappropriate hedge. A model from Ben-Artzi&#x27;s previous job at Goldman Sachs suggested that the gap option was worth about 8% of the value of the trades, worth $10.4bn. Simpson claims that traders were not simply understating the gap option but actively mismarking the value of their trades.

====European debt crisis, 2009–today====
In 2008, Deutsche Bank reported its first annual loss in five decades, despite receiving billions of dollars from its insurance arrangements with AIG, including US$11.8 billion from funds provided by US taxpayers to bail out AIG.

Based on a preliminary estimation from the European Banking Authority (EBA), in late 2011, Deutsche Bank AG needed to raise capital of about €3.2 billion as part of a required 9% core Tier 1 ratio after sovereign debt write-down starting in mid-2012.

As of 2012, Deutsche Bank had negligible exposure to Greece, but Spain and Italy accounted for a tenth of its European private and corporate banking business with credit risks of about €18 billion in Italy and €12 billion in Spain.

In 2017, Deutsche Bank needed to get its common equity tier-1 capital ratio up to 12.5% in 2018 to be marginally above the 12.25% required by regulators.

====Since 2012====
In January 2014, Deutsche Bank reported a €1.2 billion ($1.6 billion) pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter of 2013. This came after analysts had predicted a profit of nearly €600 million, according to FactSet estimates. Revenues slipped by 16% versus the prior year.

Deutsche Bank&#x27;s Capital Ratio Tier-1 (CET1) was reported in 2015 to be only 11.4%, lower than the 12% median CET1 ratio of Europe&#x27;s 24 biggest publicly traded banks, so there would be no dividend for 2015 and 2016. Furthermore, 15,000 jobs were to be cut.

In June 2015, the then co-CEOs, Jürgen Fitschen and Anshu Jain, both offered their resignations to the bank&#x27;s supervisory board, which were accepted. Jain&#x27;s resignation took effect in June 2015, but he provided consultancy to the bank until January 2016. Fitschen continued as joint CEO until May 2016. The appointment of John Cryan as joint CEO was announced, effective July 2015; he became sole CEO at the end of Fitschen&#x27;s term.

In January 2016, Deutsche Bank pre-announced a 2015 loss before income taxes of approximately €6.1 billion and a net loss of approximately €6.7 billion. Following this announcement, a bank analyst at Citi declared: &quot;We believe a capital increase now looks inevitable and see an equity shortfall of up to €7 billion, on the basis that Deutsche may be forced to book another €3 billion to €4 billion of litigation charges in 2016.&quot;

May 2017, Chinese conglomerate HNA Group became its biggest shareholder, owning 9.90% of its shares.
However, HNA Group&#x27;s stake reduced to 8.8% as of 16 February 2018.

In November 2018, the bank&#x27;s Frankfurt offices were raided by police in connection with investigations around the Panama papers and money laundering. Deutsche Bank released a statement confirming it would &quot;cooperate closely with prosecutors&quot;.

AUTO1 FinTech is a joint venture of AUTO1 Group, Allianz, SoftBank and Deutsche Bank.

In February 2019, HNA Group announced cutting stake in Deutsche Bank to 6.3 percent. It was further reduced to 0.19 percent as at March 2019.

During the Annual General Meeting in May 2019, CEO Christian Sewing said he was expecting a &quot;deluge of criticism&quot; about the bank&#x27;s performance and announced that he was ready to make &quot;tough cutbacks&quot; after the failure of merger negotiations with Commerzbank AG and weak profitability. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;its finances and strategy [are] in disarray and 95 percent of its market value [has been] erased&quot;. News headlines in late June 2019 claimed that the bank would cut 20,000 jobs, over 20% of its staff, in a restructuring plan. On 8 July 2019, the bank began to cut 18,000 jobs, including entire teams of equity traders in Europe, the US, and Asia. On the previous day, Sewing had laid blame on unnamed predecessors who created a &quot;culture of poor capital allocation&quot; and chasing revenue for the sake of revenue, according to a &quot;Financial Times&quot; report, and promised that going forward, the bank &quot;will only operate where we are competitive&quot;.

In January 2020, Deutsche Bank had decided to cut the bonus pool at its investment branch by 30% following restructuring efforts.

In February 2021, it was reported that Deutsche Bank made a profit of €113 million ($135.6 million) for 2020, the first annual net profit it had posted since 2014.

In March 2021, Deutsche Bank sold about $4 billion of holdings seized in the implosion of Archegos Capital Management in a private deal. The move helped Deutsche Bank emerge unscathed after Archegos defaulted on margin loans used to build up highly leveraged bets on stocks.

== Shareholders ==
Deutsche Bank is one of the leading listed companies in German post-war history. Its shares are traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and, since 2001, also on the New York Stock Exchange and are included in various indices, including the DAX and the Euro Stoxx 50. As the share had lost value since mid-2015 and market capitalization had shrunk to around €18 billion, it temporarily withdrew from the Euro Stoxx 50 on 8 August 2016. With a 0.73% stake, it is currently the company with the lowest index weighting.

In 2001, Deutsche Bank merged its mortgage banking business with that of Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank to form Eurohypo AG. In 2005, Deutsche Bank sold its stake in the joint company to Commerzbank.

In 1972, the bank created the world-known blue logo &quot;Slash in a Square&quot; – designed by Anton Stankowski and intended to represent growth within a risk-controlled framework.

==Business divisions==

The bank&#x27;s business model rests on three pillars – the Corporate &amp; Investment Bank (CIB), the Private &amp; Commercial Bank and Asset Management (DWS).

===Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB)===

The Corporate &amp; Investment Bank (CIB) is Deutsche Bank&#x27;s capital markets business. The CIB comprises the below six units.

* Corporate Finance is responsible for advisory and mergers &amp; acquisitions (M&amp;A).
* Equities / Fixed Income &amp; Currencies. These two units are responsible for sales and trading of securities.
* Global Capital Markets (GCM) is focused on financing and risk management solutions. It includes debt and equity issuances.
* Global Transaction Banking (GTB) caters to corporates and financial institutions by providing commercial banking products including cross-border payments, cash management, Securities Services, and international trade finance.
* Deutsche Bank Research provides analysis of products, markets, and trading strategies.

===Private and Commercial Bank===

* Private &amp; Commercial Clients Germany / International is the retail bank of Deutsche Bank. In Germany, it operates under two brands – Deutsche Bank and Postbank. Additionally, it has operations in Belgium, Italy, Spain and India. The businesses in Poland and Portugal are in the process of being sold.
* Wealth Management functions as the bank&#x27;s private banking arm, serving high-net-worth individuals and families worldwide. The division has a presence in the world&#x27;s private banking hotspots, including Switzerland, Luxembourg, the Channel Islands, the Cayman Islands and Dubai.

===Deutsche Asset Management (DWS)===
Deutsche Bank holds a majority stake in the listed asset manager DWS Group (formerly Deutsche Asset Management), which was separated from the bank in March 2018.

==Controversies==

Deutsche Bank in general as well as specific employees have frequently figured in controversies and allegations of deceitful behavior or illegal transactions. As of 2016, the bank was involved in some 7,800 legal disputes and calculated €5.4 billion as litigation reserves, with a further €2.2 billion held against other contingent liabilities. According to the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, Deutsche Bank has long had an &quot;abject&quot; reputation. Between 2008 and 2016, Deutsche Bank paid around nine billion dollars in fines and settlements related to wrongdoings across different issue areas. The FinCEN file leaks documented around $1.3 trillion of suspicious transactions through Deutsche Bank between 1999 and 2017. More than half of all suspicious transactions involving major banks in the FinCEN files leaks involved Deutsche Bank.

===Role in financial crisis of 2007–2008===

In January 2017, Deutsche Bank agreed to a $7.2 billion settlement with the United States Department of Justice over its sale and pooling of toxic mortgage securities in the years leading up to the Financial crisis of 2007–2008. As part of the agreement, Deutsche Bank was required to pay a civil monetary penalty of $3.1 billion and provide $4.1 billion in consumer relief, such as loan forgiveness. At the time of the agreement, Deutsche Bank was still facing investigations into the alleged manipulation of foreign exchange rates, suspicious equities trades in Russia, as well as alleged violations of United States sanctions against Iran and other countries. Since 2012, Deutsche Bank had paid more than €12 billion for litigation, including a deal with U.S. mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

===Espionage scandal, 2009===
In 2009, the bank admitted it engaged in covert espionage on its critics from 2001 to 2007 directed by its corporate security department, although it characterized the incidents as &quot;isolated&quot;. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Deutsche Bank had prepared a list of names of people who it wanted investigated for criticism of the bank, including Michael Bohndorf (an activist investor in the bank), Leo Kirch (a former media executive in litigation with the bank), and the Munich law firm of Bub Gauweiler &amp; Partner, which represented Kirch. According to the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, the bank&#x27;s legal department was involved in the scheme along with its corporate security department. The bank hired Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton to investigate the incidents on its behalf. The Cleary firm submitted its report, which however was not made public. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the Cleary firm uncovered a plan by which Deutsche Bank was to infiltrate the Bub Gauweiler firm by having a bank mole hired as an intern at the Bub Gauweiler firm. The plan was allegedly cancelled after the intern was hired but before she started work. Peter Gauweiler, a principal at the targeted law firm, was quoted as saying &quot;I expect the appropriate authorities including state prosecutors and the bank&#x27;s oversight agencies will conduct a full investigation.&quot;

Deutsche Bank&#x27;s law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton in Frankfurt published a report in July 2009 saying, it found no systemic misbehaviour and there was no indication that present members of the management board had been involved in any activity that raises legal issues or has had any knowledge of such activities. This was confirmed by the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office in Frankfurt in October 2009. BaFin found deficiencies in operations within Deutsche Bank&#x27;s security unit in Germany but no systemic misconduct. The bank said it took steps to strengthen controls for the mandating of external service providers by its Corporate Security Department.

===Deutsche Bank document release, 2014===
On 26 January 2014, William S. Broeksmit, a risk specialist at Deutsche Bank who was very close to Anshu Jain and hired by Edson Mitchell to spearhead Deutsche Bank&#x27;s foray into international investments and money management in the 1990s, released numerous Deutsche Bank documents from the New York branch of the Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (DBTCA), which Broeksmit&#x27;s adopted son Val Broeksmit, who is a close friend of Moby, later gave, along with numerous emails, to both Welt am Sonntag and ZDF, which revealed numerous irregularities including both a $10 billion money laundering scheme spearheaded by the Russia branch of Deutsche Bank at Moscow, which the New York State Department of Financial Services fined Deutsche Bank $425 million, and derivatives improprieties.

===Libor scandal, 2015===

On 23 April 2015, Deutsche Bank agreed to a combined US$2.5 billion in fines – a US$2.175 billion fine by American regulators, and a €227 million penalty by British authorities – for its involvement in the Libor scandal uncovered in June 2012. It was one of several banks colluding to fix interest rates used to price hundreds of trillions of dollars of loans and contracts worldwide, including mortgages and student loans. Deutsche Bank also pleaded guilty to wire fraud, acknowledging that at least 29 employees had engaged in illegal activity. It was required to dismiss all employees who were involved with the fraudulent transactions. However, no individuals were charged with criminal wrongdoing. In a Libor first, Deutsche Bank will be required to install an independent monitor. Commenting on the fine, Britain&#x27;s Financial Conduct Authority director Georgina Philippou said &quot;This case stands out for the seriousness and duration of the breaches ... One division at Deutsche Bank had a culture of generating profits without proper regard to the integrity of the market. This wasn&#x27;t limited to a few individuals but, on certain desks, it appeared deeply ingrained.&quot; The fine represented a record for interest rate related cases, eclipsing a $1.5 billion Libor related fine to UBS, and the then-record $450 million fine assessed to Barclays earlier in the case. The size of the fine reflected the breadth of wrongdoing at Deutsche Bank, the bank&#x27;s poor oversight of traders, and its failure to take action when it uncovered signs of abuse internally.

=== U.S. sanctions violations, 2015 ===
On 5 November 2015, Deutsche Bank was ordered to pay US$258 million (€237.2 million) in penalties imposed by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the United States Federal Reserve Bank after the bank was caught doing business with Burma, Libya, Sudan, Iran, and Syria, which were under US sanctions at the time. According to the US federal authorities, Deutsche Bank handled 27,200 US dollar clearing transactions valued at more than US$10.86 billion (€9.98 billion) to help evade US sanctions between early 1999 until 2006 which were done on behalf of Iranian, Libyan, Syrian, Burmese, and Sudanese financial institutions and other entities subject to US sanctions, including entities on the Specially Designated Nationals by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.

In response to the penalties, the bank will pay US$200 million (€184 million) to the NYDFS while the rest (US$58 million; €53.3 million) will go to the Federal Reserve. In addition to the payment, the bank will install an independent monitor, fire six employees who were involved in the incident, and ban three other employees from any work involving the bank&#x27;s US-based operations.

===Tax evasion, 2016===
In June 2016 six former employees in Germany were accused of being involved in a major tax fraud deal with CO2 emission certificates, and most of them were subsequently convicted. It was estimated that the sum of money in the tax evasion scandal might have been as high as €850 million. Deutsche Bank itself was not convicted due to an absence of corporate liability laws in Germany.

===Russian money-laundering operations===
In January 2017, the bank was fined $425 million by the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) and £163 million by the UK Financial Conduct Authority regarding accusations of laundering $10 billion out of Russia.

In the decade preceding the Russian mirror-trading scheme, Deutsche Bank was informed of substantial and widespread compliance concerns. The offsetting trades in this instance lacked economic purpose and could have been used to facilitate money laundering or other illegal activity. On 30 January 2017, the NYSDFS (New York State Department of Financial Services) fined Deutsche Bank $425 million for violating New York&#x27;s anti-money laundering laws. There was a &quot;mirror trading&quot; scheme involved. Deutsche Bank&#x27;s Moscow, London, and New York branches laundered $10 billion out of Russia.

The Global Laundromat scandal revealed Deutsche Bank&#x27;s involvement in a vast money-laundering operation over the period 2010–2014. The operation may have involved as much as $80 billion. In 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that a confidential internal report at Deutsche Bank showed that the bank could face fines, legal action, and even possible prosecution of senior management over the bank&#x27;s role in the money laundering.

In 2020, it was reported that Deutsche Bank was pursuing an expansion of its Russia operations.

In the wake of Russia&#x27;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Deutsche Bank refused to close down its Russia business. At the same time, other banks and major businesses were exiting Russia.

In June 2023, the bank notified customers that it could no longer guarantee them access to the shares they hold on the basis of depositary receipts issued prior to February 2022. He explained this by the shortage of shares in the Russian depository. The bank also warned that it would be able to return the funds for the share significantly below the market price.

=== Relationship with Donald Trump, 1995–2021===

Deutsche Bank is widely recognized as being the largest creditor to real-estate mogul and politician Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States, lending him and his company more than $2 billion over twenty years ending 2020. The bank held more than $360 million in outstanding loans to him prior to his 2016 election. Although his 2019 final report never mentioned Deutsche Bank, as of December 2017, Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigated Deutsche Bank&#x27;s role in Trump and Russian parties allegedly cooperating to elect him. , Deutsche Bank&#x27;s relationship with Trump was also under investigation by two U.S. congressional committees and by the New York attorney general.

In April 2019, House Democrats subpoenaed the Bank for Trump&#x27;s personal and financial records. On 29 April 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump, his business, and his children Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump sued Deutsche Bank and Capital One bank to block them from turning over financial records to congressional committees. On 22 May 2019, judge Edgardo Ramos of the federal District Court in Manhattan rejected the Trump suit against Deutsche Bank, ruling the bank must comply with congressional subpoenas. Six days later, Ramos granted Trump&#x27;s attorneys their request for a stay so they could pursue an expedited appeal through the courts. In October 2019, a federal appeals court said the bank asserted it did not have Trump&#x27;s tax returns. In December 2019, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Deutsche Bank must release Trump&#x27;s financial records, with some exceptions, to congressional committees; Trump was given seven days to seek another stay pending a possible appeal to the Supreme Court.

In May 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that anti-money laundering specialists in the bank detected what appeared to be suspicious transactions involving entities controlled by Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, for which they recommended filing suspicious activity reports with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department, but bank executives rejected the recommendations. One specialist noted money moving from Kushner Companies to Russian individuals and flagged it in part because of the bank&#x27;s previous involvement in a Russian money-laundering scheme.

On 19 November 2019, Thomas Bowers, a former Deutsche Bank executive and head of the American wealth management division, was reported to have committed suicide in his Malibu home. Bowers had been in charge of overseeing and personally signing over $360 million in high-risk loans for Trump&#x27;s National Doral Miami resort. The loans had been subject to a criminal investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation of the president&#x27;s 2016 campaign involvement in Russian election meddling. Documents on those loans have also been subpoenaed from Deutsche Bank by the House Democrats together with the financial documents of the president. A relationship between Bowers&#x27;s responsibilities and apparent suicide has not been established; the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner – Coroner closed the case, giving no indication to wrongdoing by third parties.

In early 2021, Deutsche Bank elected to discontinue its relationship with Donald Trump following the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

=== Fine for business with Jeffrey Epstein, 2020 ===
Deutsche Bank lent money and traded currencies for the well-known sex offender Jeffrey Epstein up to May 2019, long after Epstein&#x27;s 2008 guilty plea in Florida to soliciting prostitution from underage girls, according to news reports. Epstein and his businesses had dozens of accounts through the private-banking division. From 2013 to 2018, &quot;Epstein, his related entities and his associates&quot; had opened over forty accounts with Deutsche Bank.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Deutsche Bank managers overruled compliance officers who raised concerns about Epstein&#x27;s reputation&quot;.&quot;

The bank found suspicious transactions in which Epstein moved money out of the United States, &quot;The Times&quot; reported.

On 7 July 2020, the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) imposed a $150 million penalty on Deutsche Bank, in connection with Epstein. The bank had &quot;ignored red flags on Epstein&quot;. Later that month, the son and husband of the judge involved in the trial were shot by a gunman posing as a FedEx driver, with the son dying of his injuries.

On 24 November 2022, two unnamed women that accused Epstein of sexual abuse and sex trafficking also sued Deutsche Bank for its role in enabling Epstein to run his sex-trafficking operations by ignoring red flags regarding his account and the withdrawal of suspiciously high sums of money.

=== Involvement in Danske Bank money-laundering scandal, 2018 ===
On 19 November 2018, a whistleblower of the Danske Bank money laundering scandal stated that a large European bank was involved in helping Danske process $150 billion in suspect funds. Although the whistleblower, Howard Wilkinson, did not name Deutsche Bank directly, another inside source claimed the institute in question was Deutsche Bank&#x27;s U.S. unit.
In 2020 it became known that the U.S. arm of Deutsche Bank processed more than $150 billion of the $230 billion dirty money through New York, for which it was fined 150 million $. After a raid in 2019, Frankfurt-based prosecutors imposed a fine of $15.8 million in 2020 for DB&#x27;s failure on more than 600 occasions to promptly report suspicious transactions.

===Improper handling of ADRs, 2018===

On 20 July 2018, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay nearly $75 million to settle charges of improper handling of &quot;pre-released&quot; American depositary receipt (ADRs) under investigation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Deutsche Bank didn&#x27;t admit or deny the investigation findings but agreed to pay disgorgement of more than $44.4 million in ill-gotten gains plus $6.6 million in prejudgment interest and a penalty of $22.2 million.

=== Malaysian 1MDB fund ===
In July 2019, U.S. prosecutors investigated Deutsche Bank&#x27;s role in a multibillion-dollar fraud scandal involving the 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. Deutsche Bank helped raise $1.2 billion for the 1MDB in 2014. As of May 2021 Malaysia sued Deutsche Bank to recover billions in alleged losses from a corruption scandal at the fund.

=== Commodities trading, bribery fine, 2021 ===
In January 2021, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay a U.S. fine of more than $130 million for a scheme to conceal bribes to foreign officials in countries such as Saudi Arabia and China, and the city of Abu Dhabi, between 2008 and 2017 and a commodities case where it spoofed precious metals futures.

=== Strip club scandal, 2022 ===
In March 2022, Ben Darsney, Ravi Raghunathan, Brandon Sun, and Daniel Gaona were exposed for trying to expense strip club nights out as legitimate business visits. Brandon Sun attempted to cover up the incident, but the bankers were let go for violating the Company Code of Conduct.

=== Greenwashing, 2022 ===
On the 31st of May, 2022, police in Germany raided the offices of Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt over allegations of greenwashing. In late July 2023, the Financial Times reported that DWS (80% owned by Deustche Bank) which was also involved in the case was nearing a settlement having earmarked €21mn for the settlement and incurred €39mn in legal costs. DWS had made misleading statements about the size of their ESG assets and the employee who raised concerns was fired unfairly. Reuters composed a more extensive timeline highlighting how the issue developed over the course of several years including when the stock price fell sharply on news of a US SEC investigation and the resignation of the CEO.

=== Anti-competitive Bond Trading, 2005–2016 ===
In 2023, it was revealed that Deutsche Bank was involved in anti-competitive bond trading in UK and EU bonds. In Europe, Deutsche revealed cartel activities in the period between 2005 and 2016 to regulators to receive immunity. &quot;Deutsche Bank would have been fined almost €156 million for its participation in the absence of immunity.&quot; In the UK, Deutsche also admitted to wrongdoing for the period 2009–2013 to the Competition and Markets Authority.

<text>This is a list of the current and former [[capital city|capitals]] of the subdivisions of China since the Yuan dynasty. The history of China and its administrative divisions is long and convoluted. Provinces ( ) were first created during the Yuan dynasty. Years may not line up perfectly during periods of turmoil (e.g. at the end of each dynasty).

The list includes current and former provinces, as well as other first-level administrative units that have been used over the course of China&#x27;s recent history, such as autonomous regions, military command zones during the Qing dynasty, and so forth. Unless otherwise specified, a given administrative unit can be assumed to be a province with its present name. Historical names of provinces and entities that are not provinces will be specified as they arise.

Excluded from the list:

* units below the first level;
* Direct-controlled municipalities of China and special administrative regions;
* subnational entities of short-lived regimes, such as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Chinese Soviet Republic, Manchukuo, Mengjiang, Wang Jingwei Government, etc. This is because their provinces were usually transitory in existence and tended to be smaller than usual.

Many of the capitals given in this chart have had multiple historical names during different dynasties. In some cases, different names were used concurrently for the same city. This chart gives only the modern names for the sake of simplicity.

For the sake of simplicity, the chart will not attempt to be exhaustive in its descriptions of border changes.

<doc id="523941" wikidata="Q3396490" url="?curid=523941" title="Champlain Bridge (Montreal, 1962–2019)">
<text>The Champlain Bridge () was a steel truss cantilever bridge with approach viaducts constructed of prestressed concrete beams supporting a prestressed concrete deck paved with asphalt. Opened in 1962, the bridge crossed the Saint Lawrence River, connecting the Island of Montreal to its South Shore suburbs.

Together with the Jacques Cartier Bridge, it was administered by the Jacques Cartier and Champlain Bridges Incorporated (JCCBI), a Canadian Crown Corporation which reports to Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada. Since December 21, 1978, JCCBI was responsible for the management, maintenance and monitoring of the Champlain Bridge.

The bridge saw about 50million crossings per year, of which 200,000 were buses. On an average weekday, 66% of users were commuters. It was one of the busiest bridges in Canada until its closure in 2019. 

Towards the end of its life, the Champlain Bridge was well known to be in an advanced state of decay. Long-discussed plans to construct a replacement bridge finally came to fruition when construction commenced in 2015. In 2019, upon the opening of the new bridge (formally known as the Samuel-De Champlain Bridge), the original Champlain Bridge was closed and promptly demolished, concluding 57 years of service.

==Specifications==
The Champlain Bridge project was undertaken in 1955 and construction proceeded between 1957 and 1962. The bridge carried six lanes of vehicle traffic; three in each direction. During rush hour one lane of those heading off the island in the morning, and onto the island in the evening, was used as a reserved bus lane for buses to be able to head in the opposite direction. The bridge was opened to traffic in stages as the approaches were completed between June 1962 and September 1964. It was subsequently connected to the Bonaventure Expressway, which was part of the north approach to the bridge. The expressway was opened to traffic on April 21, 1967. It was one of North America&#x27;s busiest highways with almost 59million crossings annually.

==Construction history==
On August 17, 1955, Federal Transport Minister George Marler announced the planned construction of a new bridge connecting Montreal to the South Shore via Nun&#x27;s Island. The city&#x27;s existing bridges (Victoria, Cartier, and Mercier) had become inadequate to support the amount of traffic that carried residents from the growing South Shore suburbs into Montreal.

The project was initially called the Nuns&#x27; Island Bridge because it crosses Nuns&#x27; Island. In 1958, it was named the Champlain Bridge in honour of the explorer Samuel de Champlain.

The National Harbours Board was placed in charge of the project. Through several lengthy meetings and consultations in the fall of 1955, the location for the bridge and its approaches were selected. Originally, the plan had been to build the bridge with only 4 lanes, with room for further expansion to 6 lanes. During the design phase, however, it was decided to go with an initial 6-lane design.

It was opened on June 28, 1962 at 4 p.m. with only one approach from Montreal, via Wellington Street. A section including approaches to and from Atwater Street and La Vérendrye Boulevard were opened two years later.

In 1967, the final approach to the bridge on the Montréal side was completed when the Bonaventure Expressway was opened to traffic.

A $0.25 toll ($0.08 if paid with tokens) was charged to finance the $35million cost of the Champlain Bridge. The toll was collected until 1990, when the Jacques Cartier and Champlain Bridges Incorporated (JCCBI), which took over jurisdiction of the bridge a dozen years earlier, removed the toll plaza.

In 1992, the concrete deck of the cantilever metal part was replaced by an orthotropic steel deck. Gutters to channel the corrosive runoff to the river appeared in 1994. The pressure exerted by the reinforced beams on the ends of the trimmers then required the reinforcement of the latter by steel rods under tension.

In November 2013, a crack was discovered in a critical part of the superstructure. One lane was closed immediately, and emergency repair plans were put in place. During preparation, the crack enlarged and a second lane was closed. On November 29, 2013, a temporary external beam of 75 tons, named &quot;super-beam&quot; by the media, was urgently installed to reinforce the structure. In June 2014, JCCBI replaced the super-beam with a modular truss that was designed and manufactured in Quebec.

As part of a 2014–2017 Edge girder reinforcement program, 94 modular trusses and six shoring systems were installed to stabilize the condition of the bridge girders.

==Problems and replacement==
Montreal&#x27;s climate subjected the Champlain Bridge to wintry cold, snowfall, and windy conditions, as well as contrasting hot and humid summer conditions, all of which accelerated damage to the bridge. Because of the potential danger from ice accumulation during winter, the bridge was salted every season for decades. Salt attacks both the concrete and steel rebar used in girders, pylons, and other parts. The problems associated with the design and maintenance of the Champlain Bridge thus exceeded the useful life of several structural components. The design and construction of the structure prevented the isolation of outdated elements and their replacement with new ones, as could be done on other structures. Given the advanced deterioration of the bridge, it was constantly monitored by 300 sensors.

Several reinforcement measures and rehabilitation programs were deployed over time by JCCBI. However, none of these were effective in the long term.

In 2009, the Government of Canada announced in its 2009 Economic Action Plan that it would be allocating $212million to renew the bridge. In March 2011, the Government of Canada announced $158 million were to be spent on a major repair and maintenance program as concerns mounted that it was at risk of collapse. Montreal&#x27;s &quot;La Presse&quot; newspaper cited two leaked engineering reports prepared for a federal bridge agency that suggested sections of the structure were in a severe state of deterioration. The report concluded that a partial or complete collapse of the span could not be ruled out.

Starting in 2009, JCCBI — the Federal agency that managed the structure — began conducting a major repair program to extend the useful life of the Champlain Bridge. In 2010, JCCBI retained international engineering firm Delcan to carry out an expert study of the bridge&#x27;s structural health. The firm returned a report entitled &quot;The Future of the Champlain Bridge Crossing&quot;. In the Executive Summary, the bridge was said to be &quot;functionally deficient&quot; for both current and long-term traffic demands, and showing &quot;significant deterioration&quot;. One finding suggested that the Champlain Bridge was in &quot;very much poorer condition than would be typical&quot; for comparable bridges. Delcan concluded that the bridge had &quot;many deficiencies&quot; and, even in light of the methodical inspection and rehabilitation of the structure undertaken by its owners, that continued operation &quot;entails some risks that cannot altogether be quantified&quot;.

In September 2007, faced with rising costs for the maintenance of the Champlain Bridge, then Canadian Minister of Transport Lawrence Cannon confirmed that his department was seriously considering the construction of a replacement structure. In August 2008, Transport Canada announced that it was exploring different scenarios for a new bridge. In October 2011, then Minister of Transport Denis Lebel officially announced that construction on the new bridge would begin within 10 years.

In April 2015, the federal government selected the JV consortium: Signature on the St. Lawrence Group to build the new bridge. The consortium mainly included SNC-Lavalin, the Spanish ACS Infrastructure, and Dragados Canada. T.Y. Lin International served as the Lead Designer.

Construction on the new bridge officially began on June 16, 2015. On December 19, 2018, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities François-Philippe Champagne announced that the official name of the new bridge would be the Samuel-de-Champlain Bridge. The bridge opened to northbound/westbound traffic on June 24, 2019 (St-Jean-Baptiste Day), with the official opening ceremony being held on June 28, 2019, and southbound/eastbound traffic opening on 1 July 2019 (Canada Day). The multi-purpose runway was opened in November 2019 followed by the REM train tracks on July 31, 2023.

As soon as the new bridge was opened to traffic, the old bridge was closed and demolition work began immediately.

<doc id="523943" wikidata="Q597787" url="?curid=523943" title="Smoked beer">
<text>Smoked beer () is a type of beer with a distinctive smoke flavour imparted by using malted barley dried over an open flame.

==History==
Drying malt over an open flame in a smoke kiln may impart a smoky character to the malt. This character may carry over to beers brewed with the smoked malt. Before the modern era, drying malted barley in direct sunlight was used in addition to drying over flames. Even though hot air kiln drying of malt, using indirect heat, did not enter into widespread usage until the industrial era, the method was known as early as the first century BC. Also, there have been various methods over the years of preparing cereal grains for brewing, including making beer from bread, so smoked beer was not universal.

Beginning in the 18th century, hot air kiln drying of malt became progressively more common and, by the mid-19th century, had become the near-universal method for drying malted grain. Since the hot air kiln method prevents any smoke from coming into contact with wet malt, a smoky flavour is not imparted to the grain, nor to the subsequent beer. As a result, smoke flavour in beer became less and less common, and eventually disappeared almost entirely from the brewing world.

==Bamberg &quot;Rauchbier&quot;==

Certain breweries maintained the smoked beer tradition by continuing to use malt which had been dried over open flames. The malt is dried over fires made from beechwood logs. The malt and fermenting beer are stored under the pub and brewery in a part of the catacombs of Bamberg, a maze of tunnels under the city built from the 11th century onward, which have a very stable moisture and temperature. In former times, ice was used to cool the fermenting beer tank room, the &quot;Lagerkeller&quot;. This ice was locally harvested above ground in the winter, although when the winter was too mild, ice was imported from as far away as Finland or Sweden. The beer is then filtered to clarify it and remove yeast remnants, and put into oaken vats. Two brewpubs in Bamberg, Germany, Schlenkerla and Spezial, have continued this type of smoked beer production for more than a century. Several varieties of &quot;Rauchbier&quot; (&quot;smoked beer&quot; in German) are produced by these companies. Both are still in operation today, alongside seven other breweries in the same town. Since the rauchbier tradition was continuously preserved in Bamberg, the beer style is now marketed as &quot;Bamberg Rauchbier&quot;. 

Due to the popularity of craft beer in recent years, smoke-flavoured industrially-produced malts became available, and so the style has been attempted worldwide, including in its heartland of Franconia and Bamberg. Schlenkerla and Spezial, however, use a traditional, elaborate way of smoke malting. In 2017 Slow Food included these two &quot;Rauchbiere&quot; in their Ark of Taste.

The Brewers Association distinguishes three variations of Bamberg-style &quot;Rauchbier&quot;: &quot;Helles&quot; , &quot;Märzen&quot;, and &quot;Bock&quot;. Each is brewed according to the underlying style, but with smoked malts replacing some or all of the mash bill.

==&quot;Grodziskie&quot;==

&quot;Grodziskie&quot; or &quot;Grätzer&quot; are similar, traditional smoked beers from Poland, but made from wheat and highly carbonated, and with a perhaps older history, although they saw a period of no production in the late 1990s.

&quot;Grodziskie&quot; traditionally contain 2.7–3.7% alcohol by volume with little to no hop flavor or aroma, and medium-low to medium bitterness. Typical coloration is straw to gold.

<text>Thomas Pendry, Baron Pendry, (10 June 1934 – 26 February 2023) was a British Labour politician and member of the House of Lords. He was previously the Labour member of parliament for Stalybridge and Hyde from 1970 to 2001. In 2000, prior to his retirement as an MP he was made a member of the Privy Council on the recommendation of Tony Blair. After the 2001 election he was elevated to the peerage on 4 July as Baron Pendry, of Stalybridge in the County of Greater Manchester. He was president of the Football Foundation Ltd and was formerly sports advisor to Tameside District Council Sports Trust.

==Early life==
Pendry was born in Broadstairs, Kent on 10 June 1934. In an article in &quot;Cheshire Life&quot; magazine in June 2004, Pendry revealed that he was born in relatively comfortable circumstances, attending school at St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey and, later, Plater College. He worked as a trade union officer for NUPE, and as an engineer.

==Political career==
Pendry was a councillor on Paddington Borough Council in London from 1962 to 1965 (when the borough was abolished), representing Harrow Road South. He was elected to Parliament in 1970 for Stalybridge and Hyde, which at the time covered areas in Cheshire and Lancashire, and subsequently became part of Greater Manchester. He served as an opposition whip between 1971 and 1974.

==Callaghan government==
In James Callaghan&#x27;s administration between 1976 and 1979 Pendry served as a junior Lord Commissioner of the Treasury (assistant government whip) and subsequently as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.

==Opposition==
In 1979 he returned to the backbenches, until he was appointed to the post of Shadow Minister for Sport and Tourism by John Smith, a position he held until 1997. When the Labour government came to power in 1997, Pendry was the only member of the shadow team not to be appointed to a government post.

==Sport==
Lord Pendry had a love of sport that he developed during National Service with the Royal Air Force. He was appointed President of the Football Foundation in February 2003 and continued to serve in this capacity up until his death in 2023. A young Pendry learnt boxing at the hands of a Benedictine monk, becoming an Oxford Blue and boxing for the RAF.

==Other interests==
Pendry was a member of the Lords and Commons Cigar Club. From June to September 2018, he sat on the Regenerating Seaside Towns and Communities Committee. His memoir, &quot;Taking It on the Chin&quot;, was published in 2016.

==Death==
Pendry died on 26 February 2023, at the age of 88.

==Honours and arms==
On 21 July 1995, the Labour-controlled Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council, the local authority which had administered the area covered by the Stalybridge and Hyde constituency since 1974, made Pendry an honorary freeman of the borough. At the same time, the council granted him the lordship of the manor of Mottram in Longdendale. Tameside Council have also named part of Trinity Street in front of the old Stalybridge market hall, &quot;Lord Pendry Square&quot;. A local football club, Stalybridge Celtic, have named one of their stands &quot;The Lord Tom Pendry Stand&quot;.

<text>Teresa Jane Kingham (born 4 May 1963) is a British Labour Party politician. She was Member of Parliament (MP) for Gloucester from 1997 to 2001.

== Biography ==
Kingham was educated at Dartford Grammar School for Girls, and gained a BA from Royal Holloway, University of London, a PGCE from the University of East Anglia and a master&#x27;s degree in Egyptian Archaeology from University College London. She is currently studying for a PhD in Biological Anthropology at the University of Kent.

=== Political career ===
She ran as the Labour candidate for the European Parliament seat of the Cotswolds in 1994, but lost to the long-serving Conservative incumbent MEP, Henry Plumb, however she succeeded in cutting Plumb&#x27;s majority from 45,678 in 1989 to just 4,268 at that election.

Kingham was elected as MP for Gloucester in 1997, but retired from Parliament in disillusionment after just one term, having complained publicly about the antiquated ways of working in the Palace of Westminster. She later expressed dissatisfaction with the old boys network in the House of Commons, accusing various members of &quot;endlessly thrusting their groins around the Chamber in mock combat&quot; and &quot;indulging in yah-boo nonsense, point-scoring and silly games&quot;. Whilst in Parliament, Kingham successfully campaigned to change laws to protect firefighters and to get a nationwide cystic fibrosis screening programme for newborn babies. She was a Member of the International Development Select Committee.

=== Private life ===
Kingham is married to Mark Luetchford, a civil servant, trustee of War on Want and author of &quot;Waging the War on Want&quot;, the official history of the organisation. They have three children.

<doc id="523957" wikidata="Q7052276" url="?curid=523957" title="Norman Godman">
<text>Norman Anthony Godman (19 April 1937 – 20 June 2018) was a Scottish Labour Party politician.

==Early life==
Godman was one of nine children born to a trawler skipper man and a mother who worked in fish processing. After leaving Westbourne Street Boys&#x27; School at 15, he worked as a shipwright before undertaking night classes and eventually graduating from Hull and Heriot-Watt Universities with a PhD and undertaking an academic career in Scotland.

He served in the Royal Military Police during his National Service.

==Parliamentary career==
Godman first stood for election to the House of Commons at the 1979 general election when he contested Aberdeen South, but lost to the Conservative incumbent Iain Sproat by 772 votes.

He served as Member of Parliament for Greenock and Port Glasgow from 1983 to 1997, and for Greenock and Inverclyde from 1997 to 2001. From 1988 to 1989, he served as Opposition spokesman for Agricultural and Rural Affairs.

Renowned for his humility and integrity, he was a champion of the shipbuilding industry, particularly the Scott Lythgow yard on the lower Clyde. He was tenacious in his support for fishing communities and he took a lifelong interest in Irish affairs. On Northern Ireland, he championed an inquiry into Bloody Sunday and privately lobbied Tony Blair for Lord Cullen to chair an inquiry.

Godman served on the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee (1983–87), the European Legislation Committee (1989–95), the Northern Ireland Committee for a year and the Foreign Affairs Committee (1997-2001).

Bernard Ponsonby, the long-serving political editor of Scottish Television, described Godman as a &quot;warm, gentle and empathetic man&quot; whose career was characterised by &quot;a special kind of integrity&quot;.
”An old-fashioned socialist whose values were marked by a belief in social justice and world peace, he argued for his values with a consistency which always made him a prisoner of his own conscience. He never sought moral high grounds or to ever promote himself above his values.
&quot;He was humble, hard-working, sought to do right by those who needed his advocacy.
&quot;He was a model public servant who gave Parliament his hard work, his party his loyalty – when he thought it merited – and he always gave the country his best judgement&quot;.

&quot;His beliefs were incorruptible and he was incapable of bending or fashioning a view in order to get on. He had no time for spin, even less for apparatchiks who debased Labour values by wheeling and dealing&quot;.
Ponsonby cited Godman&#x27;s stand on abortion rights as an example of how he was willing to put his principles over his self-advancement, noting that he at one stage faced serious pressure from Catholic opponents who threatened his pre-selection over the issue.
&quot;He displayed a moral courage in seeing down those in his local party who saw his support for a woman’s right to choose as a ground for cutting short his Parliamentary career. He would gladly have it cut short than to do or say something that cast him as a hypocrite&quot;.

==Family==

His wife was Trish Godman, who was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for West Renfrewshire constituency from the 1999 Scottish Parliament election until her retirement in 2011.

<text>Gramsbergen (Dutch Low Saxon: &quot;Grambarge&quot;) is a small Dutch city on the Vechte, located in the municipality of Hardenberg and the province of Overijssel. The town is located on corridors of different transportation modes: The N34 (Zwolle - Emmen), the Zwolle - Emmen railway and the Almelo - de Haandrik canal.

==History==
Gramsbergen and its hamlets have been inhabited since pre-historic times. In the &#x27;Cultuur Historisch Informatie Centrum Vechtdal&#x27; (The Historical and Cultural Center of Vechtdal), in the centre of Gramsbergen, several archaeological artefacts are exhibited. These artefacts come from settlements from around 8000 BC.

It was first mentioned in 1227 as Bergene, and means &quot;the hill of Gram (person)&quot;. It received city rights in 1442.

Gramsbergen developed on higher ground along the Vechte. In 1227, the Battle of Ane was fought to the west of Gramsbergen during which the bishop of Utrecht was defeated by the citizens of Drenthe. In 1339, , a &quot;havezate&quot;, was built which developed into a castle. In 1673, it was taken by the Prince-Bishopric of Münster. The castle was destroyed in 1674 by the Dutch States Army to prevent Münster from threatening Coevorden. The city did not develop in its later history and remained relatively small. In 1840, it was home to 526 people.

As an independent municipality, Gramsbergen comprised the centres of Gramsbergen and De Krim and the hamlets Ane, Anerveen, Anevelde, , , and . Since 1 January 2001, Gramsbergen has been part of Hardenberg.

<doc id="523963" wikidata="Q270668" url="?curid=523963" title="Georges Couthon">
<text>Georges Auguste Couthon (, 22 December 1755 – 28 July 1794) was a French politician and lawyer known for his service as a deputy in the Legislative Assembly during the French Revolution. Couthon was elected to the Committee of Public Safety on 30 May 1793. Along with his close associate Louis Antoine de Saint-Just and Maximilien Robespierre, he formed an unofficial triumvirate within the committee which wielded power during the Reign of Terror until the three were arrested and executed in 1794 during the Thermidorian Reaction. A Freemason, Couthon played an important role in the development of the Law of 22 Prairial, which was responsible for a sharp increase in the number of executions of accused counter-revolutionaries.

== Background ==
Couthon was born on 22 December 1755 in Orcet in the province of Auvergne. His father was a notary, and his mother was the daughter of a shopkeeper. Couthon, like generations of his family before him, was a member of the lower bourgeoisie. Following in his father&#x27;s footsteps, Couthon became a notary. The skills that he acquired enabled him to serve on the Provincial Assembly of Auvergne in 1787, his first experience of politics. This same year, 1787 he married Marie Brunet and his first son Antoine was born. His other son Hippolyte would be born in 1790. He was well-regarded by others as an honest well-mannered individual.

Georges Couthon suffered joint problems from childhood, however it wasn&#x27;t until 1782 that his condition significantly worsened, necessitating the use of a cane by 1791 and complete reliance on a wheelchair by 1793. Doctors diagnosed Couthon with meningitis in 1792, but Couthon blamed his paralysis on the frequent sexual experiences of his youth. Although he began treating his condition with mineral baths, he grew so weak by 1793 that he was confined to a wheelchair driven by hand cranks via gears. His political aspirations took him away from Orcet and to Paris, and he joined the Freemasons in 1790 in Clermont. There, he became a fixture at its literary society, where he earned acclaim for his discussion on the topic of &quot;Patience&quot;. In 1791, Couthon became one of the deputies of the Legislative Assembly, representing Puy-de-Dôme.

== Deputy ==
In 1791, Couthon traveled to Paris to fulfill his duty as a deputy in the Legislative Assembly. He then joined the growing Jacobin Club of Paris. He chose to sit on the Left at the first meeting of the Assembly but soon decided against associating himself with such radicals, as he feared they were &quot;shocking the majority&quot;. Reportedly, he was also a very proficient speaker.

In September 1792, Couthon was elected to the National Convention. During a visit to Flanders, where he sought treatment for his health, he met and befriended Charles François Dumouriez, later writing praises of him to the Assembly and referred to him as &quot;a man essential to us.&quot; His relationship with Dumouriez briefly caused Couthon to consider joining the Girondist faction of the Assembly, but after the Girondist electors of the Committee of the Constitution refused Couthon a seat on the Committee in October 1792, he ultimately committed himself to the Montagnards and the inner group formed around Maximilien Robespierre; both shared many opinions. Couthon became an enthusiastic supporter of the Montagnards and often echoed their opinions. At the Trial of Louis XVI in December 1792, he argued loudly against the Girondist request for a referendum and went on to vote for the death sentence without appeal. On 30 May 1793 Couthon was appointed secretary of the original Committee of Public Safety. Couthon and 5 others, including his close friend Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, were brought in to assist in the drafting of the French Constitution of 1793. Three days after rising to that position, Couthon was the first to demand the arrest of proscribed Girondists.

== Lyon ==

Growing unrest had been occurring in Lyon in late February and early May. By 5 July 1793, the National Convention determined the city of Lyon to be &quot;in a state of rebellion&quot;, and by September, the Committee of Public Safety decided to send representatives to Lyon to end the rebellion. Couthon would be the representative to whom Lyon would surrender on 9 October 1793. He was suspicious of the unrest in Lyon upon his arrival and would not allow the Jacobins of the local administration to meet with one another for fear of an uprising.

In August Couthon carried a law punishing any person who should sell assignats at less than their nominal value with imprisonment for twenty years in chains; on 8 September making investments in foreign countries punishable with death. On 12 October 1793, the Committee of Public Safety passed a decree that it believed would make an example of Lyon. The decree specified that the city itself was to be destroyed. Following the decree, Couthon established special courts to supervise the demolition of the richest homes in Lyon and leave the homes of the poor untouched. In addition to the demolition of the city, the decree dictated that the rebels and the traitors were to be executed. Couthon had difficulty accepting the destruction of Lyon and did not even contribute much to the property destruction. Eventually, he would find that he could not stomach the task at hand, and by the end of October the National Convention sent a replacement. Republican atrocities in Lyon began after Couthon was replaced on 3 November 1793 by Jean Marie Collot d&#x27;Herbois, who would go on to condemn 1,880 Lyonnais by April 1794.

== Law of 22 Prairial ==
Following his departure from Lyon, Couthon returned to Paris, and on 21 December, he was elected president of the convention. In March 1794 he contributed to the prosecution of the Hébertists and Dantonists (or Indulgents). His orientation to Louis Antoine de Saint-Just and Maximilien Robespierre&#x27;s program at this time is not clear, but he did go along with the prosecutions and executions. He continued serving on the Committee of Public Safety for the next several months. On 10 June 1794 (22 Prairial Year II on the French Republican Calendar), Couthon drafted the Law of 22 Prairial with the aid of Robespierre. On the pretext of shortening proceedings, the law deprived the accused of the aid of counsel and of witnesses for their defence in the case of trials before the Revolutionary Tribunal. The Revolutionary Tribunals were charged with quick verdicts of innocence or death for the accused brought before them. The reason for the law was also related to the number of executions going on in the provinces and the lack of standard judicial proceedings for these improvised tribunals.

Couthon proposed the law without consulting the rest of the Committee of Public Safety, as both Couthon and Robespierre expected that the committee would not be receptive to it. The Convention raised objections to the measure, but Couthon justified the measure by arguing that the political crimes overseen by the Revolutionary Tribunals were considerably worse than common crimes because &quot;the existence of free society is threatened.&quot; Couthon also famously justified the deprivation of the right to a counsel by declaring, &quot;The guilty have no such right and the innocents do not need any.&quot;

Robespierre assisted Couthon in his arguments by subtly implying that any member of the Convention who objected to the new bill should fear being exposed as a traitor to the republic. Collot d&#x27;Herbois, Fouché and Tallien feared for their lives, due to the military excesses carried out by them in various regions of France to stamp out opposition to the revolutionary government. They feared that they would be exposed as having committed crimes against humanity. Almost all the deputies agreed it had become dangerous. Couthon proposed his resignation &quot;rather than be suspected of taking part in measures&quot; against his colleagues.

The law passed, and the rate of executions in Paris promptly rose. In Paris, compared to an average of 5 executions, which had been the norm two months earlier (Germinal), 17 executions would take place daily during Prairial, with 26 occurring daily during the following month of Messidor. Between the passing of the Law of 22 Prairial (10 June 1794) and the end of July 1794, 1,515 executions took place at the Place du Trône-Renversé, now Place de la Nation, more than half of the final total of 2,639 executions that occurred between March 1793 and August 1794.

== Arrest and execution ==
During the crisis preceding the Thermidorian Reaction, Couthon gave up a journey to Auvergne in order, as he wrote, that he might &quot;either die or triumph with Robespierre&quot;. Robespierre had disappeared from the political arena for an entire month because of a supposed nervous breakdown as well as for health reasons and therefore did not realise that the situation in the convention had changed. His last speech seemed to indicate that another purge of the convention was necessary, but he refused to name names. In a panic of self-preservation, the Convention called for the arrest of Robespierre and his affiliates, including Couthon, Saint-Just and Robespierre&#x27;s own brother, Augustin Robespierre. Couthon was guillotined on 10 Thermidor alongside Robespierre, but it took the executioner fifteen minutes (amidst Couthon&#x27;s screams of pain) to arrange him on the board correctly because of his paralysis.

== Legacy ==

Couthon, during the course of the French Revolution, had transitioned from an undecided young deputy to a strongly committed lawmaker. Aside from his actions in Lyon, it is perhaps the creation of the Law of 22 Prairial and the number of individuals that would be executed because of the law that have become his lasting legacy. After the acceptance of Couthon&#x27;s new decree, executions increased from 134 people in early 1794 to 1,376 people between the months of June and July 1794. The Law of 22 Prairial also allowed tribunals to target noblemen and members of the clergy with reckless abandon, as the accused no longer could call character witnesses on their behalf. Of the victims executed during June and July 1794, 38% were of noble descent and 26% represented the clergy. More than half of the victims came from the wealthier parts of the bourgeoisie. Couthon&#x27;s lawmaking greatly increased the rate of executions in Paris.

<text>Nicholas Francis St Aubyn (born 19 November 1955) is a Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom.

==Early life==
St Aubyn is the younger son of the Hon. Piers St Aubyn MC by his marriage to Mary Bailey-Southwell, and a grandson of Baron St Levan. He went to Eton College, and Trinity College, Oxford, where he was a member of the Oxford University Liberal Club and in the aftermath of the 1975 referendum on UK EEC-membership, President of the Young European Federalists. He was awarded a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in PPE in 1977; the BA was later promoted to a Master of Arts (MA Oxon) degree. Before Oxford, he lived and worked in Soweto, South Africa, through a placement with the Project Trust.

He worked as a Loan Officer for Morgan Guaranty Trust from 1977 to 1981. He was the head of the London office of Morgan Futures from 1981 to 1984, then the head of the Sterling and Arbitrage Swaps Desk from 1984 to 1986. He was Vice President of Kleinwort Benson Cross Finance from 1986 to 1987. He worked for American International Group&#x27;s Financial Products Division from 1987 to 1989. From 1989 to 1993, he was Chairman of Gemini Ltd. From 1993 to 1997, he was Chairman of Fitzroy Joinery Ltd in Plymouth.

==Political career==
From 1982 to 1986, St Aubyn was a Conservative councillor on Westminster City Council, representing Little Venice ward. He then fought the Truro by-election in March 1987 following the death of David Penhaligon, when Matthew Taylor comfortably held the seat for the Liberals. He stood again in Truro at the 1987 general election, more than halving the Liberal majority, but slipped back at the 1992 general election.

Following the retirement of long-serving Conservative MP and former minister David Howell, St Aubyn was selected as Conservative candidate for Guildford in preparation for the 1997 general election. Withstanding the national landslide against his party, he held the seat with a reduced majority over the Liberal Democrats, but at the 2001 election he narrowly lost the seat to the Liberal Democrat Sue Doughty. While in parliament, he served on the Education Select Committee and was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Michael Portillo. He did not contest the 2005 election, when Anne Milton narrowly retook the seat for the Conservatives.

==Personal life==
St Aubyn married Jane Brooks on 26 April 1980 and they have two sons (Henry and Edward) and three daughters (Kitty, Alice and Camilla). His older brother inherited the title Lord St Levan from their uncle the 4th Baron St Levan.

<text>Francis Patrick Neill, Baron Neill of Bladen, (8 August 1926 – 28 May 2016) was a British barrister and a crossbench member of the House of Lords.

==Early life and education==
A son of Sir Thomas Neill, Patrick Neill was born in Hampstead in 1926. He was educated at Highgate School and Magdalen College, Oxford. From 1944 to 1947, he served in the Rifle Brigade and became a captain.

===Legal career===
He became a barrister in 1951 and took silk in 1966. After heading One Hare Court, he became head of chambers of Serle Court in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn when the two merged in 1999. He worked alongside Henry Fisher, Roger Parker, Gordon Slynn, and Richard Southwell QC. Lord Neill left Serle Court in 2008 to join his elder brother Sir Brian Neill, a former Court of Appeal judge, at 20 Essex Street.

==University of Oxford==
He was Warden of All Souls College, Oxford, from 1977 until 1995, and appointed an Honorary Fellow in 1995. He was Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University from 1985 until 1989, and played a major part in the University&#x27;s decision to undertake The Campaign for Oxford. He was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2003 University of Oxford Chancellor election.

==Family life==
Neill was the younger brother of the paediatrician Catherine Neill (1921–2006) and of the judge Sir Brian Neill (1923–2017). In 1954 he married Caroline Susan Debenham (died 2010), daughter of Sir Piers Kenrick Debenham. They had six children.

Neill owned homes in London, in Perthshire, and in Briantspuddle, Dorset. He died from a heart attack at home in Briantspuddle on 28 May 2016, at the age of 89.

==Honours==
Having been knighted in 1983, Neill was made a Life Peer as Baron Neill of Bladen, of Briantspuddle in the County of Dorset, on 28 November 1997. He sat in the House of Lords as a crossbencher until 18 May 2016, ten days before his death, at which point he ceased to be a member pursuant to section 2 of the House of Lords Reform Act 2014, having failed to attend during the whole of the 2015–16 session without being on leave of absence.

<doc id="523968" wikidata="Q1137087" url="?curid=523968" title="Ideal number">
<text>In number theory, an ideal number is an algebraic integer which represents an ideal in the ring of integers of a number field; the idea was developed by Ernst Kummer, and led to Richard Dedekind&#x27;s definition of ideals for rings. An ideal in the ring of integers of an algebraic number field is &quot;principal&quot; if it consists of multiples of a single element of the ring. By the principal ideal theorem, any non-principal ideal becomes principal when extended to an ideal of the Hilbert class field. This means that there is an element of the ring of integers of the Hilbert class field, which is an ideal number, such that the original non-principal ideal is equal to the collection of all multiples of this ideal number by elements of this ring of integers that lie in the original field&#x27;s ring of integers.

==Example==
For instance, let formula_1 be a root of formula_2, then the ring of integers of the field formula_3 is formula_4, which means all formula_5 with formula_6 and formula_7 integers form the ring of integers. An example of a nonprincipal ideal in this ring is the set of all formula_8 where formula_6 and formula_7 are integers; the cube of this ideal is principal, and in fact the class group is cyclic of order three. The corresponding class field is obtained by adjoining an element formula_11 satisfying formula_12 to formula_3, giving formula_14. An ideal number for the nonprincipal ideal formula_8 is formula_16. Since this satisfies the equation
formula_17 it is an algebraic integer.

All elements of the ring of integers of the class field which when multiplied by formula_18 give a result in formula_4 are of the form formula_20, where

:formula_21

and

:formula_22

The coefficients α and β are also algebraic integers, satisfying

:formula_23

and

:formula_24

respectively. Multiplying formula_25 by the ideal number formula_18 gives formula_27, which is the nonprincipal ideal.

==History==
Kummer first published the failure of unique factorization in cyclotomic fields in 1844 in an obscure journal; it was reprinted in 1847 in Liouville&#x27;s journal. In subsequent papers in 1846 and 1847 he published his main theorem, the unique factorization into (actual and ideal) primes.

It is widely believed that Kummer was led to his &quot;ideal complex numbers&quot; by his interest in Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem; there is even a story often told that Kummer, like Lamé, believed he had proven Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem until Lejeune Dirichlet told him his argument relied on unique factorization; but the story was first told by Kurt Hensel in 1910 and the evidence indicates it likely derives from a confusion by one of Hensel&#x27;s sources. Harold Edwards says the belief that Kummer was mainly interested in Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem &quot;is surely mistaken&quot; (Edwards 1977, p. 79). Kummer&#x27;s use of the letter λ to represent a prime number, α to denote a λth root of unity, and his study of the factorization of prime number formula_28 into &quot;complex numbers composed of formula_29th roots of unity&quot; all derive directly from a paper of Jacobi which is concerned with higher reciprocity laws. Kummer&#x27;s 1844 memoir was in honor of the jubilee celebration of the University of Königsberg and was meant as a tribute to Jacobi. Although Kummer had studied Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem in the 1830s and was probably aware that his theory would have implications for its study, it is more likely that the subject of Jacobi&#x27;s (and Gauss&#x27;s) interest, higher reciprocity laws, held more importance for him. Kummer referred to his own partial proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem for regular primes as &quot;a curiosity of number theory rather than a major item&quot; and to the higher reciprocity law (which he stated as a conjecture) as &quot;the principal subject and the pinnacle of contemporary number theory.&quot; On the other hand, this latter pronouncement was made when Kummer was still excited about the success of his work on reciprocity and when his work on Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem was running out of steam, so it may perhaps be taken with some skepticism.

The extension of Kummer&#x27;s ideas to the general case was accomplished independently by Kronecker and Dedekind during the next forty years. A direct generalization encountered formidable difficulties, and it eventually led Dedekind to the creation of the theory of modules and ideals. Kronecker dealt with the difficulties by developing a theory of forms (a generalization of quadratic forms) and a theory of divisors. Dedekind&#x27;s contribution would become the basis of ring theory and abstract algebra, while Kronecker&#x27;s would become major tools in algebraic geometry.

<text>Operation Castle was a United States series of high-yield (high-energy) nuclear tests by Joint Task Force 7 (JTF-7) at Bikini Atoll beginning in March 1954. It followed &quot;Operation Upshot–Knothole&quot; and preceded &quot;Operation Teapot&quot;.

Conducted as a joint venture between the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and the Department of Defense (DoD), the ultimate objective of the operation was to test designs for an aircraft-deliverable thermonuclear weapon. All the devices tested, which ranged in weight from , were built to be dropped from aircraft. However, ballistic casings, fins and fusing systems would have to be attached.

Operation Castle was considered by government officials to be a success as it proved the feasibility of deployable &quot;dry&quot; fuel designs for thermonuclear weapons. There were technical difficulties with some of the tests: one device had a yield much lower than predicted (a &quot;fizzle&quot;), while two other bombs detonated with over twice their predicted yields. One test in particular, &quot;Castle Bravo&quot;, resulted in extensive radiological contamination. The fallout affected nearby islands, including inhabitants and U.S. soldiers stationed there, as well as a nearby Japanese fishing boat (the &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot;), resulting in one direct fatality and continued health problems for many of those exposed. Public reaction to the tests and an awareness of the long-range effects of nuclear fallout has been attributed as being part of the motivation for the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963.

==Background==

Bikini Atoll had previously hosted nuclear testing in 1946 as part of &quot;Operation Crossroads&quot; where the world&#x27;s fourth and fifth atomic weapons were detonated in Bikini Lagoon. Since then, American nuclear weapons testing had moved to the Enewetak Atoll to take advantage of generally larger islands and deeper water. Both atolls were part of the American Pacific Proving Grounds.

The extremely high yields of the Castle weapons caused concern within the AEC that potential damage to the limited infrastructure already established at Enewetak would delay other operations. Additionally, the cratering from the &quot;Castle&quot; weapons was expected to be comparable to that of &quot;Ivy Mike&quot;, a 10.4 megatons of TNT (Mt) device tested at Enewetak in 1952 leaving a crater approximately in diameter marking the location of the obliterated test island Elugelab.

The &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; test was the world&#x27;s first &quot;hydrogen bomb&quot;, producing a full-scale thermonuclear or fusion explosion. The &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; device used liquid deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen, making it a &quot;wet&quot; bomb. The complex dewar mechanisms needed to store the liquid deuterium at cryogenic temperatures made the device three stories tall and 82 tons in total weight, far too heavy and bulky to be a usable weapon. With the success of &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; as proof of the Teller-Ulam bomb concept, research began on using a &quot;dry&quot; fuel to make a practical fusion weapon so that the United States could begin production and deployment of thermonuclear weapons in quantity. The final result incorporated lithium deuteride as the fusion fuel in the Teller-Ulam design, vastly reducing size and weight and simplifying the overall design. &quot;Operation Castle&quot; was charted to test four dry fuel designs, two wet bombs, and one smaller device. The approval for &quot;Operation Castle&quot; was issued to JTF-7 by Major General Kenneth D. Nichols, the General Manager of the AEC, on 21 January 1954.

==Experiments==
&quot;Operation Castle&quot; was organized into seven experiments, all but one of which were to take place at Bikini Atoll. Below is the original test schedule (as of February 1954).


The &quot;Echo&quot; test was canceled due to the liquid fuel design becoming obsolete with the success of dry-fueled &quot;Bravo&quot; as noted above. &quot;Yankee&quot; was similarly considered obsolete, and the Jughead device was replaced with a &quot;Runt II&quot; device (similar to the &quot;Union device&quot;), which was hastily completed at Los Alamos and flown to Bikini. With this revision, both of the wet fuel devices were removed from the test schedule.

&quot;Operation Castle&quot; was intended to test lithium deuteride (LiD) as a thermonuclear fusion fuel. A solid at room temperature, LiD, if it worked, would be far more practical than the cryogenic liquid deuterium fuel in the Ivy Mike device. The same Teller-Ulam principle would be used as in the &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; so-called &quot;Sausage&quot; device, but the fusion reactions were different. &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; fused deuterium with deuterium, but the LiD devices would fuse deuterium with tritium. The tritium was produced during the explosion by irradiating the lithium with fast neutrons.

&quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Yankee (II)&quot;, and &quot;Union&quot; used lithium enriched in the Li-6 isotope (&quot;Bravo&quot; and &quot;Yankee&quot; used lithium enriched to 40% Li-6, while the lithium used in &quot;Union&quot; was enriched to 95% Li-6), while &quot;Romeo&quot; and &quot;Koon&quot; were fueled with natural lithium (92% Li-7, 7.5% Li-6). The use of natural lithium would be important to the ability of the US to rapidly expand its nuclear stockpile during the Cold War nuclear arms race since the so-called &quot;Alloy Development Plants&quot; were in an early stage at the time &quot;Castle&quot; was carried out. The first plant started production in late 1953.

As a hedge, the development of liquid deuterium weapons continued in parallel. Even though they were much less practical because of the logistical problems dealing with the transport, handling, and storage of a cryogenic device, the Cold War arms race drove the demand for a viable fusion weapon. The &quot;Ramrod&quot; and &quot;Jughead&quot; devices were liquid fuel designs greatly reduced in size and weight from their so-called &quot;Sausage&quot; predecessor. The &quot;Jughead&quot; device was eventually weaponized, and it saw limited fielding by the U.S. Air Force until the &quot;dry&quot; fuel H-bombs became common.

&quot;Nectar&quot; was not a fusion weapon in the same sense as the rest of the &quot;Castle&quot; series. Even though it used lithium fuel for fission boosting, the principal reaction material in the second stage was uranium and plutonium. Similar to the Teller-Ulam configuration, a nuclear fission explosion was used to create high temperatures and pressures to compress a second fissionable mass. This would have otherwise been too large to sustain an efficient reaction if it were triggered with conventional explosives. This experiment was intended to develop intermediate yield weapons for expanding the inventory (around 1-2 Mt vs. 4-8).

Many fusion or thermonuclear weapons generate much, or even most, of their yields from fission. Although the U-238 isotope of uranium will not sustain a chain reaction, it still fissions when irradiated by the intense fast neutron flux of a fusion explosion. Because U-238 is plentiful and has no critical mass, it can be added in (in theory) almost unlimited quantities as a tamper around a fusion bomb, helping contain the fusion reaction and contributing its own fission energy. For example, the fast-fission of the U-238 tamper contributed 77% (8.0 megatons) to the yield of the 10.4 Mt &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; explosion.

==Test execution==
The most notable event of &quot;Operation Castle&quot; was the &quot;Castle Bravo&quot; test. The dry fuel for &quot;Bravo&quot; was 40% Li-6 and 60% Li-7. Only the Li-6 was expected to breed tritium for the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction; the Li-7 was expected to be inert. Yet J. Carson Mark, the head of the Los Alamos Theoretical Design Division, had speculated that &quot;Bravo&quot; could &quot;go big&quot;, estimating that the device could produce an explosive yield as much as 20% more than had been originally calculated. It was discovered, because of the unexpected larger yield, that the Li-7 in the device also undergoes breeding that produces tritium. In practice, &quot;Bravo&quot; exceeded expectations by 150%, yielding 15 Mt — about 1,000 times more powerful than the &quot;Little Boy&quot; weapon used on Hiroshima. &quot;Castle Bravo&quot; remains, to this day, the largest detonation ever carried out anywhere by the United States and the fifth largest H-bomb detonation in the world.

Because &quot;Castle Bravo&quot; greatly exceeded its expected yield, JTF-7 was caught unprepared. Much of the permanent infrastructure on Bikini Atoll was heavily damaged. The intense thermal flash ignited a fire at a distance of on the island of Eneu (base island of Bikini Atoll). The ensuing fallout contaminated all of the atoll, so much so that it could not be approached by JTF-7 for 24 hours after the test, and even then, exposure times were limited. As the fallout spread downwind to the east, more atolls were contaminated by radioactive calcium ash from the incinerated underwater coral banks. Although the atolls were evacuated soon after the test, 239 Marshallese on the Utirik, Rongelap, and Ailinginae Atolls were subjected to significant levels of radiation. 28 Americans stationed on the Rongerik Atoll were also exposed. Follow-up studies of the contaminated individuals began soon after the blast as Project 4.1, and though the short-term effects of the radiation exposure for most of the Marshallese were mild and/or hard to correlate, the long-term effects were pronounced. Additionally, 23 Japanese fishermen aboard &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot; were also exposed to high levels of radiation. They suffered symptoms of radiation poisoning, and one crew member died in September 1954.

The heavy contamination and extensive damage from &quot;Bravo&quot; delayed the rest of the series. A revised test schedule was officially released on 14 April 1954. The &quot;Castle Romeo&quot; and &quot;Koon&quot; tests were complete by the time this revision was published.


As &quot;Operation Castle&quot; progressed, the increased yields and fallout caused test locations to be reevaluated. While the majority of the tests were planned for barges near the sand spit of Iroij, some were moved to the craters of &quot;Bravo&quot; and &quot;Union&quot;. In addition, &quot;Castle Nectar&quot; was moved from Bikini Atoll to the crater of &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; at Eniwetok for expediency, since Bikini was still heavily contaminated from the previous tests.

The final test in &quot;Operation Castle&quot; took place on 14 May 1954.

==Results==
&quot;Operation Castle&quot; was an unqualified success for the implementation of dry fuel devices. The &quot;Bravo&quot; design was quickly weaponized and is suspected to be the progenitor of the Mk-21 gravity bomb. The Mk-21 design project began on 26 March 1954 (just three weeks after &quot;Bravo&quot;), with production of 275 weapons beginning in late 1955. &quot;Romeo&quot;, relying on natural lithium, was rapidly turned into the Mk-17 bomb, the first deployable US thermonuclear weapon, and was available to strategic forces as an Emergency Capability weapon by mid-1954. Most of the &quot;Castle&quot; dry fuel devices eventually appeared in the inventory and ultimately grandfathered the majority of thermonuclear configurations.

In contrast, the Livermore-designed &quot;Koon&quot; was a failure. Using natural lithium and a heavily modified Teller-Ulam configuration, the test produced only 110 kilotons of an expected 1.5 megaton yield. While engineers at the Radiation Laboratory had hoped it would lead to a promising new field of weapons, it was eventually determined that the design allowed premature heating of the lithium fuel, thereby disrupting the delicate fusion conditions.

<text>Eberhard Weber (born 22 January 1940, in Stuttgart, Germany) is a German double bassist and composer. As a bass player, he is known for his highly distinctive tone and phrasing. Weber&#x27;s compositions blend chamber jazz, European classical music, minimalism and ambient music, and are regarded as characteristic examples of the ECM Records sound.

==Biography==

Weber began recording in the early 1960s, and released &quot;The Colours of Chloë&quot; (ECM 1042), his first record under his own name, in 1973. In addition to his career as a musician, he also worked for many years as a television and theater director. He has designed an electric-acoustic bass with an additional string tuned to C.

Weber&#x27;s music, often in a melancholic tone, frequently utilizes ostinatos, yet is highly organized in its colouring and attention to detail. He was an early proponent of the solid-body electric double bass, which he has played regularly since the early 1970s.

From the early 1960s to the early 1970s, Weber&#x27;s closest musical association was with pianist Wolfgang Dauner. Their many mutual projects were diverse, from mainstream jazz to jazz-rock fusion to avant-garde sound experiments. During this period, Weber also played and recorded with pianists Hampton Hawes and Mal Waldron, guitarists Baden Powell de Aquino and Joe Pass, The Mike Gibbs Orchestra, violinist Stephane Grappelli, and many others.

Starting with &quot;The Colours of Chloë&quot;, Weber has released 13 more records under his own name, all on ECM. The ECM association also led to collaborations with other ECM recording artists such as Gary Burton (&quot;Ring&quot;, 1974; &quot;Passengers&quot;, 1976), Ralph Towner (&quot;Solstice&quot;, 1975; &quot;Solstice/Sound and Shadows&quot;, 1977), Pat Metheny (&quot;Watercolors&quot;, 1977), and Jan Garbarek (10 recordings between 1978 and 1998).

In the mid-1970s Weber formed his own group, Colours, with Charlie Mariano (soprano saxophone, flutes), Rainer Brüninghaus (piano, synthesizer) and Jon Christensen (drums). After their first recording, &quot;Yellow Fields&quot; (1975), Christensen left and was replaced by John Marshall. The group toured extensively and recorded two further records, &quot;Silent Feet&quot; (1977) and &quot;Little Movements&quot; (1980), before disbanding.

Since the early 1980s, Weber has regularly collaborated with the British singer-songwriter Kate Bush, playing on four of her last six studio albums (&quot;The Dreaming&quot;, 1982; &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, 1985; &quot;The Sensual World&quot;, 1989; &quot;Aerial&quot;, 2005).

During the 1980s, Weber toured with Barbara Thompson&#x27;s jazz ensemble Paraphernalia.

Since 1990, Weber&#x27;s touring has been limited, and he has had only two new recordings under his own name: The 2001 release &quot;Endless Days&quot; is an elemental fusion of jazz and classical music flavors, fitting well the moniker &quot;chamber jazz&quot;. His main touring activity during that period was as a regular member of the Jan Garbarek Group. On the occasion of his 65th birthday, in March, 2005 he recorded Stages of a Long Journey, a live concert with the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra and featuring Gary Burton, Wolfgang Dauner and Jan Garbarek. In 2009 ECM also re-released his albums &quot;Yellow Fields&quot;, &quot;Silent Feet&quot; and &quot;Little Movements&quot; as a 3-CD collection titled &quot;Colours&quot;.

In 2007, Weber suffered a stroke and was subsequently unable to perform. In a January 2010 interview with &quot;Die Welt&quot;, he spoke about his medical condition and future projects.

Weber was awarded the prestigious Albert Mangelsdorff-Preis in November 2009. A box set of his 1970s works was released by ECM Records the same month.

Weber&#x27;s latest albums, &quot;Résumé&quot; (2012) and &quot;Encore&quot; (2015) comprise solos from his performances worldwide with The Jan Garbarek Group, overdubbed with keyboards/treatments by Weber, sax by Garbarek, and flügelhorn by Ack Van Rooyen.

His autobiography, &quot;Résumé&quot;, was published in 2015. An English translation by Heidi Kirk - &quot;Eberhard Weber: A German Jazz Story&quot; - was published in October 2021.

In 2021, the 13-minute recording &quot;Eberhard&quot; by the late Lyle Mays was posthumously released, revised from a 2009 composition debuted at Lawrence University and written as a tribute to Weber&#x27;s influential compositional style. It was awarded a Grammy for Best Instrumental Composition in 2022.

==Literary connections==
Weber has, on at least five occasions, drawn on text from the book &quot;Watership Down&quot; (by Richard Adams) for the names of his compositions and albums. Examples include &quot;Silent Feet&quot; and &quot;Eyes That Can See in the Dark&quot; from the &quot;Silent Feet&quot; album; &quot;Often in the Open&quot; from the &quot;Later That Evening&quot; album; and &quot;Quiet Departures&quot; and &quot;Fluid Rustle&quot; on the &quot;Fluid Rustle&quot; album.

<text>Richard Andrew Ryder, Baron Ryder of Wensum, (born 4 February 1949) is a British Conservative Party politician. A former Member of Parliament (MP) and government minister, he was made a life peer in 1997 and was a member of the House of Lords from 1997 to 2021.

==Early life==
He was educated at Radley College and Magdalene College, Cambridge.

In the 1981 Birthday Honours Ryder was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), for political service.

==Parliamentary career==
Having unsuccessfully fought the Labour seat of Gateshead East in February and October 1974, Ryder was elected at the 1983 general election as MP for the Mid Norfolk constituency. From 1990 to 1995 he was the government&#x27;s Chief Whip. This period includes the Conservative backbench rebellion over the Maastricht Treaty. The maverick MPs, known as the Maastricht Rebels, were under intense pressure from the government whips but still brought the administration of John Major close to collapse.

Ryder retired from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, and was created a life peer as Baron Ryder of Wensum, of Wensum in the County of Norfolk on 22 November 1997. He retired from the Lords on 12 April 2021.

==Outside Parliament==

He became Vice-Chairman of the BBC on 1 January 2002 for a four-year term.

Ryder was appointed Acting Chairman of the BBC following the resignation of Gavyn Davies on 28 January 2004. Davies resigned following the criticism of the BBC in the Hutton Report, which was set up to investigate &quot;the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr David Kelly&quot;. One of Ryder&#x27;s first acts as chairman was to give a televised statement, during which he offered an unreserved apology for the mistakes made during the Dr. Kelly affair. This apology was criticised by many, including departing Director General, Greg Dyke, as overdone. In the same statement Ryder announced that the process to select a new Chairman had begun, and that he would not be putting his name forward. Michael Grade was appointed on 2 April 2004 and took up his post on 17 May; Ryder resumed the post of Vice-Chairman.

Ryder resigned early on 1 August 2004, after which the position was assumed by Anthony Salz.

Ryder was the Chairman of the Institute of Cancer Research, and is a director of Ipswich Town F.C.

==Family==
A nephew of Sue Ryder, later Baroness Ryder and Cheshire, he married in 1981 Caroline Stephens , only daughter of Sir David Stephens and Clemency Gore-Browne.

Lord and Lady Ryder of Wensum had two children.

<text>The Hunt Museum () is a museum located in the Custom House in the city of Limerick, Ireland. It holds a personal collection donated by the Hunt family, it was originally situated in the University of Limerick, before being moved to its present location in Limerick&#x27;s Georgian custom house in 1997.

Among the museum&#x27;s collection are works by notable artists and designers such as Pablo Picasso, Jack B. Yeats, and Sybil Connolly as well as distinctive historical items such as the O&#x27;Dea Mitre and Crozier.

==History==

As antique dealers and advisors to collectors, as well as collecting pieces commercial purposes, John and Gertrude Hunt also acquired pieces that reflected their own interests and curiosity. During the latter stages of John Hunt&#x27;s life, the couple became increasingly aware of the scale of their collection and wished that it would remain intact, so they began to search for a permanent home for it. They met Professor Patrick Doran of the National Institute of Higher Education (now University of Limerick) and Dr Edward Walsh, the institute&#x27;s president, who agreed to house a substantial part of the collection on a temporary basis. The Hunt Museum opened there in 1978 in an exhibition room with the display designed by architect Arthur Gibney.

During this period, the Irish government had declined the offer of the Hunt&#x27;s collection, so the requirement to find a suitable home and owner to take responsibility for the artefacts became more urgent. The Hunt Museums Trust was established in 1974 to hold the collection, and the property at Craggaunowen (a 16th-century four-storey tower house, typical of late medieval Ireland, purchased and restored by John and Gertrude Hunt) was held in trust on behalf of the people of Ireland. The trust established The Hunt Museum Ltd., the sole purpose of which was the establishment of a permanent home for the museum. A public private partnership involving the University of Limerick, Shannon Development, Limerick Corporation and the Department of Arts, Heritage, the Gaeltacht and the Islands, linked with local business interests secured the historic 18th-century former custom house in Limerick city together with the funds to restore and renovate the building for use as a museum. The museum was officially opened by the then Taoiseach John Bruton on 14 February 1997.

==Custom House==
The Hunt Museum is housed in Limerick&#x27;s former Custom House, an eighteenth century building constructed in limestone rather than red brick which was used in the construction of most of the city&#x27;s Georgian houses. It is a Palladian-style building designed by the Italian architect, Davis Ducart, in 1765 and completed between 1765 and 1769.

The Limerick Custom House was the administrative centre for the Revenue Commissioners (including Customs and Excise) in Limerick and it was also the home of the Customs Collector in the eighteenth century. In the 1840s, with the introduction of a new postal system, a Penny Post Office was opened in the Custom House.

The Office of Public Works (OPW) undertook a major restoration and refurbishment of the building, completing it in 1996. The Custom House opened as The Hunt Museum on 14 February 1997. The anniversary of the opening of The Hunt Museum is celebrated annually as &#x27;Open Day&#x27; with free admission, talks, tours, and workshops.

==Collection==
The Hunt Museum holds about 2,500 different artefacts, both from Ireland and abroad. The oldest pieces are from Stone-Age Ireland and ancient Egypt. The collection includes the Antrim Cross (an early 9th-century cast bronze and enamel cross), dresses by Irish designer Sybil Connolly, drawings by Picasso and a bronze horse once thought to be a design by Leonardo da Vinci for a large monument. The bronze horse is similar to the Budapest horse, but its provenance was disproven in 2009. Some of the Hunt collection is also on display at the nearby Craggaunowen in County Clare, which was also greatly contributed to by John and Gertrude Hunt.

===Religious artefacts===
John Hunt was extremely interested in early Christian art and artefacts and he collected them widely, so the museum collection held many religious items from rosary beads to statues of varying sizes, from not just Ireland but from around Europe. The Museums &#x27;Treasury Room&#x27; houses a great number of these items and among the artefacts in this room are the Arthur Cross and Arthur Chalice. Also found in the collection are a number of medieval Christian pieces such as the Antrim Cross, the Cashel Bell, and the Hohenzollern Crucifix.

=== Sybil Connolly ===

The Sybil Connolly collection at The Hunt Museum is formed by different documents, sketches, letters, photographs, ceramic and textile items. The textile collection is made up for 45 pieces designed by Sybil Connolly during her career. Most of the collection, which includes dresses like the &quot;Heiress Dress&quot; or &quot;Pink Ice Dress&quot;, was donated to museum by Gertrude Hunt.

===Horse Outside===

In 2011 a lifesize model of a horse, painted by young people aged 10–18 was placed outside the front of the building. This was joined by a second one in 2012. The models are made of fibreglass, and are taken inside at night. The art installation was inspired by the song &quot;Horse Outside&quot; by the group The Rubberbandits.

==Controversy==
In December 2003, the Simon Wiesenthal Center alleged in a letter to President Mary McAleese that the museum&#x27;s collection contained items looted by the Nazis during the Second World War, although the letter did not refer to any specific items in the collection. The museum denied the claims.

An inquiry led by former Supreme Court judge Donal Barrington was set up by the museum, but its members resigned in February 2005, saying that the museum&#x27;s funding made an independent inquiry impossible, and requesting that a more appropriate inquiry be created. The Department of Arts then provided €150,000 in funding for a second inquiry led by former civil servant Seán Cromien, under the auspices of the Royal Irish Academy (RIA). The second inquiry submitted an interim report to the RIA in February 2006. In the meantime, in October 2005, the museum had published a catalogue of its exhibits on the internet, providing details of all the items in its collection. In June 2006, the inquiry submitted a final report, which was published on the RIA&#x27;s website. Also in June 2006, a one-day conference took place on the theme of &quot;Contested Cultural Property and Museums: The Case of the Hunt Museum&quot;. At this conference, a message was conveyed from Shimon Samuels, who had sent the original letter of allegation, questioning why he had not been invited to the seminar. Later, the terms of reference of the Hunt Museum Evaluation Group were questioned, the Simon Wiesenthal Center believing that more emphasis should have been placed on investigating the purported Nazi links of the Hunt family and the Hunt Museum Evaluation Group believing that this lay beyond their terms of reference, which were to do with provenance research. The RIA issued a press release responding to the statement of the Simon Wiesenthal Center.

===Resolution===
A 2007 report from Lynn Nicholas, published by the RIA following three years of investigation, called the Wiesenthal Center&#x27;s allegations &quot;unprofessional in the extreme&quot;. Nicholas found that the Wiesenthal Center had misidentified names in the letters:
:&quot;The name used, four times in one letter, is Buhl, not Buhrle, and the individual described, an unreliable dealer who sells forgeries, certainly bears no resemblance to the extremely rich collector and armaments manufacturer Emil Buhrle,&quot; the report said.

In 2008, the Simon Wiesenthal Center published a 165 page analysis entitled, &quot;The Hunt Controversy: A Shadow Report&quot;, written by Erin Gibbons, which covered the history of the controversy and the findings.

<text>Christopher John Fred Gill RD (born 28 October 1936) is a British politician, and a former member of the National Executive Committee of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). He is the president of The Freedom Association (TFA). A former Conservative Party Member of Parliament, he was one of the Maastricht Rebels of the mid-1990s.

==Biography==
Gill was born in Wolverhampton, where he later became a local councillor, and was educated locally at Birchfield Preparatory School, then at Shrewsbury School. His national service was in the Royal Navy, serving aboard and . He retired as Chairman of his family&#x27;s sausage-making business, F.A. Gill Ltd., in 2006.

Gill served as Conservative MP for Ludlow from 1987 to 2001, when he stepped down. He was known as the &quot;Butcher from Ludlow&quot; because of his family company being a meat processing firm. He had the Conservative whip withdrawn over the EC Finance Bill on 28 November 1994.

As a constituency MP, Gill fought against the closure of local cottage hospitals. Gill was also known for being an expert on areas of European Union legislation, and he was a notable Eurosceptic.

Shortly before leaving Parliament in 2001, he resigned his membership of the Conservatives. In 2006, Gill announced that he had joined the UK Independence Party (UKIP), having endorsed the party&#x27;s policies at the 2004 European Parliament election. He was an elected member of UKIP&#x27;s National Executive Committee from 2007 until 2010. He stood for Ludlow as a UKIP candidate at the 2010 general election, coming fourth with 2,127 votes, 4.4% of the total, losing his deposit but almost tripling the 2005 vote. At the time of the election, Gill stated that his reasoning for standing was: &quot;I am standing against &#x27;call me Dave&#x27;s&#x27; Tories because I cannot tolerate their utter contempt for the concerns of voters on matters of immigration, economy, individual liberty and the broken promise of a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.&quot;

He was chairman of The Freedom Association from 2001, before becoming its president in 2007.

<text>Christopher S. Axworthy, (March 10, 1947 – August 11, 2023) was a Canadian politician and academic.

== Law professor ==
After teaching law at the University of New Brunswick and Dalhousie Law School, Chris Axworthy came to Saskatoon in 1984 as the founding executive director of the Centre for the Study of Co-operatives and as a professor of law at the University of Saskatchewan. In 2003 he returned to the University of Saskatchewan as a professor of law, where he taught until the spring of 2008.

In the spring of 2008, he was appointed Dean of Robson Hall at the University of Manitoba for a five-year term beginning on July 1, 2008. He was also the President of the Institute of Parliamentary and Political Law.

In May 2010, Axworthy assumed the position as the Founding Dean of Law at Thompson Rivers University&#x27;s new law school, which opened in Fall 2011. On July 15, 2013, he resigned this position.

==Political career==
Axworthy was elected as a Saskatchewan Member of Parliament for the New Democratic Party in 1988 and was re-elected in 1993 and 1997.

Axworthy resigned from the House of Commons on June 1, 1999, to join the cabinet of then Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow. He was elected as an MLA in a by-election as the Saskatchewan NDP MLA for the constituency of Saskatoon-Fairview with 64% of the vote. He was also re-elected three months later in a general election that same year. He served as Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. After Romanow stepped down, Axworthy ran against Lorne Calvert for the provincial NDP leadership convention and finished second. Axworthy, who was still serving as Justice Minister, resigned as MLA in January 2003.

Although he had been an NDP member for his entire political career, Axworthy announced his bid for the Liberal nomination in the riding of Saskatoon—Wanuskewin on March 5, 2004. He received 32.58% of the vote, but lost to incumbent Conservative MP, Maurice Vellacott. He lost to Vellacott a second time in the 2006 federal election.

==Personal life and death==
Axworthy was born in Plymouth, England on March 10, 1947. He died from cancer on August 11, 2023, at the age of 76.

<doc id="523988" wikidata="Q192281" url="?curid=523988" title="Severnaya Zemlya">
<text>Severnaya Zemlya (, ) is a archipelago in the Russian high Arctic. It lies off Siberia&#x27;s Taymyr Peninsula, separated from the mainland by the Vilkitsky Strait. This archipelago separates two marginal seas of the Arctic Ocean, the Kara Sea in the west and the Laptev Sea in the east.

Severnaya Zemlya was first noted in 1913 and first charted in 1930–32, making it the last sizeable archipelago on Earth to be explored. Administratively, the islands form part of Russia&#x27;s Krasnoyarsk Krai. In Soviet times there were a number of research stations in different locations, but currently there are no human inhabitants in Severnaya Zemlya, except for the Prima Polar Station near Cape Baranov.

The largest glacier in the Russian Federation, the Academy of Sciences Glacier, is located in Severnaya Zemlya. Until recently, ice joined the islands to Eurasia, even at its smallest extent during the late summer melt season, blocking the Northeast Passage between the Atlantic and the Pacific. By the late summer of 2012, however, due to Arctic sea ice decline the permanent ice had reached a record low extent and open water appeared to the south of the archipelago.

==History==
Although Severnaya Zemlya lies not far off the northern coast of Siberia, cartographers did not formally record it until the 20th century. Earlier explorers deemed that there was a land mass in the general area - note for example the report by Matvei Gedenschtrom and Yakov Sannikov made in 1810 at the time of their exploration of the New Siberian Islands.

Later in the 19th century, Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld during the &quot;Vega&quot; expedition sailed very close to this land in 1878 but did not notice it. In 1882, the Danish Arctic explorer and naval officer Andreas Peter Hovgaard, leader of the Arctic survey &quot;Dijmphna&quot; expedition, set himself the goal of discovering land north of Cape Chelyuskin and exploring the unknown northeastern limits of the Kara Sea. However, Hovgaard was prevented from accomplishing his objectives after having become trapped in thick ice, and his expedition was unable to reach even the shores of the Taymyr Peninsula.

Even at the end of the 19th century, both Nansen&#x27;s &quot;Fram&quot; expedition of 1895 and Eduard Toll&#x27;s Russian polar expedition of 1900–02 on the ship &quot;Zarya&quot; failed to note any traces of land to the north of the strait between the Kara Sea and the Laptev Sea that they navigated.

===Emperor Nicholas II Land===

The archipelago first appeared on the map with the 1913–1915 Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition of the icebreakers &quot;Taimyr&quot; and &quot;Vaigach&quot;. The chief organiser and first captain of the &quot;Vaygach&quot; was officer Aleksandr Vasiliyevich Kolchak of the Imperial Russian Navy. The expedition, privately financed, was launched in 1910 and led by Boris Vilkitsky on behalf of the Russian Hydrographic Service. This venture accomplished its goal of exploring the uncharted areas of the continental side of the Northern Sea Route.

On 3 September 1913 (22 August 1913 in the Julian calendar used by Russia at the time), members of Vilkitsky&#x27;s expedition landed on what is now known as Cape Berg on present-day October Revolution Island. They raised the Russian flag on the shore and named the new territory Tayvay Land (, &quot;Zemlya Tayvay&quot;), after the first syllable of each of their icebreakers&#x27; names. During the days that followed, Vilkitsky&#x27;s expedition charted parts of the Laptev Sea coast of what they believed to be a single island. Barely six months later, in early 1914, by order of the Secretary of the Imperial Navy, the new discovery was renamed &quot;Emperor Nicholas II Land&quot; (, &quot;Zemlya Imperatora Nikolaya II&quot;), after the ruling Emperor Nicholas II of Russia.

===Later exploration and present era===
In 1926, the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR renamed the still not fully-explored land &quot;Severnaya Zemlya&quot;. In May 1928, Umberto Nobile and his crew in the Airship &quot;Italia&quot; attempted to overfly the islands, but adverse weather conditions forced them to turn southward when only an hour or two from viewing the archipelago&#x27;s coastline.

In the spring of 1931, Georgy Ushakov, accompanied by the geologist Nikolay Urvantsev, the veteran surveyor Sergei Zhuravlev, and the radio-operator Vasily Khodov, thoroughly surveyed Severnaya Zemlya during a two-year expedition to the archipelago. Ushakov and his team established a small base at Golomyanny – the western end of Sredniy Island, off October Revolution Island&#x27;s western coast. From there they made multiple surveying-trips into the interior and to the coastlines of the larger islands. The first detailed map drawn by the expedition&#x27;s cartographers showed Severnaya Zemlya divided into four main islands. Geographic features of the territory were named after communist organisations, events, and personalities. With reference to Severnaya Zemlya Ushakov wrote:
The &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; flew over the area during its polar flight of July 1931 and recorded some cartographic and meteorological data; Hugo Eckener tried to take pictures of the yet unsurveyed western coast, but it was obscured by fog and clouds.

Although German communists had endured suffering under the Third Reich, due to anti-German sentiment caused by the 1941–1945 German-Soviet War in the USSR some features of Severnaya Zemlya that had been previously named in solidarity with German Communism were given Russian or neutral-sounding names, e.g. Cape Unslicht becoming &quot;Mys Peschanyy&quot; and &quot;Proliv Yungshturm&quot; becoming Yuny Strait.

During the period of the Cold War (1940s to 1980s), the islands of Severnaya Zemlya continued to be studied by a team of geologists from NIIGA (the Scientific Research Institute of Arctic Geology) in St. Petersburg, (then known as Leningrad). Between 1948 and 1954 a comprehensive geological map was compiled under B. Kh. Egiazarov. Also more accurate maps were drawn by means of cartographic data gathered from aerial-photography surveys.

Administratively, Severnaya Zemlya formed part of the Taymyr Autonomous Okrug until this okrug was merged into Krasnoyarsk Krai on 1 January 2007. it belongs to the Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District of Krasnoyarsk Krai. There has been a request at the Krasnoyarsk Krai Legislative Assembly to reinstate the former name of Severnaya Zemlya as &quot;Emperor Nicholas II Land&quot; (). This request, however, has been rejected by the local government for the time being.

==Geography==

Severnaya Zemlya comprises four major islands – October Revolution, Bolshevik, Komsomolets, and Pioneer – and around 70 smaller islands, covering a total area of about . It is separated from the Taymyr Peninsula by the Vilkitsky Strait. Komsomolets is separated from Canada&#x27;s northernmost point, Cape Columbia, by under 2000 km.

Four of the main islands are largely glaciated, October Revolution, Komsomolets, and Pioneer, as well as the smaller Schmidt Island at the northwestern limit. The glacierised area on Bolshevik, the southernmost main island of the group, covers about a quarter of its land&#x27;s surface. The southmost point of Severnaya Zemlya is Cape Neupokoyev at the SW end of Bolshevik Island. The highest point of the archipelago is Mount Karpinsky, the summit of the Karpinsky Glacier, an ice dome on October Revolution Island. The Red Army Strait separates Komsomolets Island from October Revolution Island and the broader Shokalsky Strait Bolshevik Island from October Revolution Island. Both straits connect the Kara Sea in the west with the Laptev Sea in the east.

This archipelago encloses the northern limits of the Kara Sea on its western shores, together with Novaya Zemlya, located roughly to the southwest. The large rivers Ob and Yenisei, among others, flow from the south into this marginal sea area of the Arctic Ocean, with their abundant waters contributing to a climate with relatively high precipitation despite the prevalent extreme cold temperatures of the high latitude. The Laptev Sea, where the mighty Lena River steadily expands its large delta, lies to the east of Severnaya Zemlya. The topographic relief of the archipelago is quite smooth, with Neoproterozoic and Palaeozoic sedimentary successions dominating its bedrock geology.

===Glaciers===

Glaciers in the archipelago have a characteristic dome shape with a continuously decreasing surface towards their edges. Ice cliffs are found only at the base. The places where the glaciers reach the sea contribute to the formation of icebergs. The most active glacier fronts are the eastern side of the Academy of Sciences Glacier at Krenkel Bay as well as its southern side. Another quite active glacier is the Rusanov Glacier on the island of October Revolution with its terminus at Matusevich Fjord.

October Revolution, with seven glaciers, is the island with most individual glaciers in Severnaya Zemlya. Next are the islands of Bolshevik with six, Komsomolets with four, Pioneer with two and Schmidt Island with one. The largest glacier is the Academy of Sciences Glacier in Komsomolets, which is also the largest ice cap of Russia —a and thick ice dome reaching above sea level covering about two-thirds of the surface of the island.

===Main islands===
====October Revolution====
October Revolution Island (, &quot;Ostrov Oktyabrskoy Revolyutsii&quot;) is the largest island of the Severnaya Zemlya group in the Russian Arctic.

The area of this island has been estimated at making it the 59th largest island in the world. It rises to a height of on Mount Karpinsky. Half the island is covered with glaciers reaching down into the sea. In the sections free from ice, the vegetation is desert or tundra. The island was first explored and named by the expedition of G.A. Ushakov and Nikolay N. Urvantsev in 1930–32.

October Revolution Island houses five domed ice caps; clockwise from north, they are named: Rusanov, Karpinsky, University, Vavilov and Albanov. The Vavilov Meteorological Station was operated from 1974 to 1988 on the northern part of the Vavilov Ice Cap. Other minor ice caps on the island include the Mal&#x27;yutka Glacier. The Podemnaya River and the Bolshaya River drain to the northwest between the Vavilov and Albanov glaciers, and the Bedovaya and Obryvistaya Rivers drain to the north between Albanov and Rusanov. The largest lake of the island and the entire archipelago, Fiordovoye, is located on the southwestern edge of the Karpinsky glacier. To the east and south of the island are the large Matusevich Fjord and the smaller Marat Fjord. They, together with the lake, encircle the Karpinsky ice cap. Cape October is located in the northern part of the island facing the Red Army Strait.

&quot;Ostrov Vysokiy&quot; is an islet located in a small bay on October Revolution Island&#x27;s southwest shores.

====Bolshevik====

Bolshevik Island (, ) is the southernmost and second largest island in the group, located across the Shokalsky Strait from October Revolution Island. The area of this island has been estimated at .

Bolshevik Island is mountainous, reaching a height of . It houses an Arctic base named &quot;Prima&quot; near Cape Baranov.

Parts of the shore of the island are deeply indented, with Mikoyan Bay in the north and Solnechny Bay in the south, as well as fjords such as the large Akhmatov Fjord, and the smaller Thaelmann Fjord, Spartak Fjord and Partizan Fjord.

Bolshevik Island is comparatively less glaciated than the other islands of Severnaya Zemlya. Only about 30% of the island is covered by glaciers while the coastal plains have a sparse vegetation of moss and lichen. The Leningrad Glacier, Semyonov-Tyan-Shansky Glacier, Kropotkin Glacier, Mushketov Glacier and Aerosyomki Glacier are located in the interior of the island and do not reach the sea.

&quot;Ostrov Tash&quot; is a small island located on Bolshevik&#x27;s southern shore. &quot;Lavrov Island&quot; is located off the NE shore and &quot;Ostrov Lishniy&quot; off its northern tip.

====Komsomolets====

Komsomolets Island () is the northernmost island of the Severnaya Zemlya group in the Russian Arctic, and the third largest island in the group. It is the 82nd largest island on earth.

The northernmost point of the island is called the Arctic Cape. This is the launching point for many Arctic expeditions.

The area of this island has been estimated at . It rises to a height of . Some 65% of the island is covered with glaciers. Komsomolets Island is home to the largest ice cap in Russia, the Academy of Sciences Ice Cap, which covers most of the island between Krenkel Bay in the east and Zhuravlev Bay in the west.

The soil of the island is mostly composed of loose loam and sand, a tundra desert scattered with mosses and lichens. The island was first explored and named by the expedition of Georgy Ushakov and Nikolay Urvantsev in 1930–32. In keeping with their scheme of naming the islands after events and movements of the Russian Revolution, this island was named in honour of the members of the Komsomol, the &quot;Communist Union of Youth&quot;.

Off the northwestern shores of Komsomolets Island lies a group of islets known as &quot;Ostrova Dem&#x27;yana Bednogo&quot;.

====Pioneer Island====
Pioneer Island, Ostrov Pioner in Russian. It is the westernmost of the large islands of the Severnaya Zemlya group and is separated from Komsomolets Island by the Yuny Strait. Pioneer island measures in area.

This island houses the Pioneer Glacier. Thelodonti fossils from the Upper Silurian have been found in the island.

Off Pioneer Island&#x27;s southwestern end lies Krupskoy Island. This is a fairly large island, over in length and about in width. The sound that separates it from Pioneer is only in width.

This island should not be confused with Pioneer Island in Canada ().

====Schmidt Island====

Schmidt Island, measuring , is located at the far northwestern end of the archipelago. This island is quite detached from the whole Severnaya Zemlya group. It is also its northernmost island and before modern climate warming it was fully in the region of permanent sea ice.

This island is almost entirely covered by the Schmidt Ice Cap. Owing to its exposed position, the climate in the Schmidt Island&#x27;s area is much colder than in the rest of the archipelago.

Schmidt Island was named after the Soviet scientist Otto Schmidt.

===Minor islands and island groups===
Close to the main archipelago of Severnaya Zemlya there are a number of smaller islands and archipelagos. There are also many small coastal islands and islets in different locations, such as Krupskoy to the west of Pioneer and Naydenysh () near Cape Anuchin in October Revolution Island. Among the other minor islands the following deserve mention:

====Sedov Archipelago====

The Sedov Archipelago, formerly known as Sergey Kamenev Islands, is located just west of October Revolution Island on the Kara Sea side. The main islands of this archipelago are &quot;Sredny&quot; (the longest island), &quot;Domashnyy&quot;, &quot;Strela&quot;, and &quot;Figurnyy&quot;. Close to the shore of October Revolution Island lies &quot;Obmannyy Island&quot; and further offshore southwards lies &quot;Dlinnyy Island&quot;. These other coastal islands are sometimes included as part of the Sedov Group.

&quot;Golomyanniy Meteorological Station&quot;, located on the western tip of Sredniy Island at , was the wintering site and base of the 1931–32 expedition and has been taking continuous measurements since 1954.

An official request has been forwarded to rename Domashnyy Island as &quot;Svyatoy Anastasii&quot; (), St. Anastasia Island.

====Krasnoflotskiye Islands====

Located just south of October Revolution Island in the Kara Sea. The Krasnoflotskiye Islands () extend from north to south in an almost straight line . The main islands are &quot;Sverdlova&quot; – very close to Cape Sverdlov on the coast, &quot;Bolshoy&quot; – not much larger than the others despite its name, &quot;Sredniy&quot; and &quot;Greben&quot; far offshore. All islands are devoid of vegetation.

Two small islets named &quot;Opasnye&quot;, which are also part of this group, lie to the southwest of Greben Island.

The Krasnoflotskiye Islands were first sighted and mapped in August 1932 by the expedition of the All-Union Arctic Institute on the icebreaker &quot;Rusanov&quot;. There is an Arctic Station in the Krasnoflotskiye Islands (AS-042), which has been operating since 1953.

====Maly Taymyr and Starokadomsky====

This is a small group including two main islands located in the Laptev Sea, off the far southeastern end of Bolshevik Island. Maly Taymyr, the largest island, has a land surface of and is at .

Maly Taymyr was discovered by Boris Vilkitsky during the Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition in 1913 and was named &quot;Tsarevich Alexei Island&quot; (), after the son of Zar Nicholas II of Russia. Following the 1917 October Revolution the island was renamed &quot;Maly Taymyr&quot;. In 2005 an official request was forwarded to the local government in Krasnoyarsk Krai in order to reinstate its former name to the island as &quot;Alexei Island&quot;.

&quot;Starokadomsky Island&quot; is close by to Maly Taymyr, located off its northwestern side and separated from it by a narrow sound. This island was named after Dr. Leonid Starokadomsky, one of the leaders of the 1913 Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition.

====Lishniy Island====

Lishniy Island () is a coastal island located on the eastern side of the mouth of Akhmatov Fjord, southeast of Cape Unslicht, off Bolshevik Island&#x27;s northern end at . The island has an irregular shape and is long with a maximum width of .

A deep round lake with a diameter of is located in the western part of the island and is connected to the sea by a small channel. Almost all the island is rocky, except for the northwestern part. The highest point of Lishniy Island is 

South of Lishniy lies &quot;Yuzhnyy&quot;, a smaller island, and two islets. Lishniy off Severnaya Zemlya should not be confused with Lishny Island off Toll Bay, south of the Firnley Islands.

==Climate==
Severnaya Zemlya is consistently cold and quite dry (Köppen &quot;ET&quot; bordering on &quot;EF&quot;), with a mean annual temperature of , mean annual precipitation of about , and generally overcast skies. Monthly average temperature ranges from in February to in July. The archipelago sees large temperature fluctuations during winter months, as low-pressure cyclonic activity originating in the North Atlantic make their way across the Arctic, bringing precipitation and higher temperatures. These cyclones are most common in September and October, which see 30% of annual precipitation. Snowfall in summer is common as temperatures hover around , although higher temperatures occur when warm air masses move north from Siberia.

==Flora and fauna==
Severnaya Zemlya is a polar desert with sparse vegetation and permafrost at less than . Rare vascular plants include species of &quot;Cerastium&quot; and &quot;Saxifraga&quot;. Non-vascular plants include the moss genera &quot;Detrichum&quot;, &quot;Dicranum&quot;, &quot;Pogonatum&quot;, &quot;Sanionia&quot;, &quot;Bryum&quot;, &quot;Orthothecium&quot; and &quot;Tortula&quot;, as well as the lichen genera &quot;Cetraria&quot;, &quot;Thamnolia&quot;, &quot;Cornicularia&quot;, &quot;Lecidea&quot;, &quot;Ochrolechia&quot; and &quot;Parmelia&quot;. Common flowering plants of the high Arctic such as the purple saxifrage (&quot;Saxifraga oppositifolia&quot;) and the Arctic poppy (&quot;Papaver radicatum&quot;) also occur on Severnaya Zemlya.

According to a survey of prior observations by De Korte, Volkov, and Gavrilo, thirty-two bird species have been observed on Severnaya Zemlya, 17 of which are known to breed on the islands. Eight species are widespread across the archipelago: five of which are colonial seabirds: little auk (&quot;Alle alle&quot;), black-legged kittiwake (&quot;Rissa tridactyla&quot;), black guillemot (&quot;Cepphus grylle&quot;), ivory gull (&quot;Pagophila eburnea&quot;), and glaucous gull (&quot;Larus hyperboreus&quot;); and three species of tundra bird: the snow bunting (&quot;Plectrophenax nivalis&quot;), purple sandpiper (&quot;Calidris maritima&quot;), and brent goose (&quot;Branta bernicla&quot;).

The most common mammal on Severnaya Zemlya is the collared lemming (&quot;Dicrostonyx torquatus&quot;), also known as Arctic lemming, which is present on all of the large islands and, in some places has been recorded to reach a density of 500 per km2 (1,300 per sq mi). The Arctic fox (&quot;Alopex lagopus&quot;) has been known to den on the islands, with several hundred observed in the 1980s. Other mammals occasionally observed include the wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), the polar bear (&quot;Ursus maritimus&quot;), ermine (&quot;Mustela erminea&quot;), walrus (&quot;Odobenus rosmarus&quot;), Arctic hare (&quot;Lepus timidus&quot;), and reindeer (&quot;Rangifer tarandus&quot;).

==In culture==

The discovery of Severnaya Zemlya is the subject of Veniamin Kaverin&#x27;s novel &quot;The Two Captains&quot; as well as its stage adaptation, &quot;Nord-Ost&quot;.

The location of a secret Russian space weapons control facility is called Severnaya in the 1995 James Bond film &quot;GoldenEye.&quot; In several maps seen onscreen, however, this Severnaya is depicted as being in central Siberia. Severnaya is a level in &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, a 1997 video game based on the Bond film. 

Severnaya is the site of a Kaiju-controlled rogue Jaeger (giant mech) in the 2018 film &quot;Pacific Rim Uprising&quot;.

Severnaya is the site of the final act of the 2021 movie &quot;The Tomorrow War&quot;, where the protagonists locate a crashed spaceship holding the dormant White Spike Aliens.

<text>The Salisbury Convention (officially called the Salisbury Doctrine, the Salisbury-Addison Convention or the Salisbury/Addison Convention) is a constitutional convention in the United Kingdom under which the House of Lords should not oppose the second or third reading of any government legislation promised in its election manifesto. The origins of the convention date back to the late 19th century, at which time the Conservatives held a majority in the House of Lords and, with the support of the third Marquess of Salisbury, developed the &quot;Referendal Theory&quot;, which applied solely to Liberal legislation, under which the House of Lords could obstruct legislation until it had received majority approval at a general election. This was changed following the landslide Labour Party victory in the 1945 general election, which produced a Labour government seen as having a popular mandate for significant reform, while once again there was a Conservative majority in the House of Lords. The fifth Marquess of Salisbury (grandson of the third) announced that the Lords &quot;would not seek to thwart the main lines of Labour&#x27;s legislation provided it derived from the party&#x27;s manifesto for the previous election&quot;. From this point, manifesto bills were only to be adjusted by the Lords; however, on non-manifesto bills, the Lords were able to act as they had before.

==Prior practice==
From the Liberal split over the Irish Home Rule Bill 1886 until the effects of the House of Lords Act 1999, the second chamber had a Conservative majority (or, in later years, quasi-majority given the overall tendency of the crossbenchers to side with Conservatives) so manifesto commitments of the Liberal Party and Labour Party could not be sure of passing. Since the Lords threw out the Liberal budget in 1909, there had been a convention that they do not interfere on financial matters. In the Parliament Act 1911 the Peers lost their right to vote down a financial measure and their veto over other measures was reduced to a two-year delaying power, later reduced to one year by the Parliament Act 1949.

A Conservative majority of Lords used their maximum power, of delaying via wrecking amendments, certain Bills tabled by the 1929–1931 minority Labour ministry. Most legislation worked its way through by threatening use of the Parliament Act 1911.

==Creation==

At the time of the landslide Labour general election victory in 1945, 16 of more than 761 peers qualified to sit in the House of Lords were Labour-affiliated. This small minority was led by Lord Addison.

As Clement Attlee&#x27;s Labour government had a clear electoral mandate to deliver the policies of nationalisation and welfare state measures, supporters and commentators supposed that the unelected House of Lords would not oppose the second reading of such legislation. Ministers and ex-ministers in the Lords echoed that the destruction and social plight caused by World War II called for more state spending. However, Lord Salisbury, Conservative Leader in the Lords, offered a lasting statement of principles, now regarded as a constitutional convention, as to the etiquette of how the House of Lords should treat bills fulfilling manifesto promises.

==Definition==
Lord Addison and the pre-accelerated Lord Salisbury, the Conservative leader in the House of Lords from 1942 to 1957, both with memories of the troubles leading to the passing of the Parliament Act 1911, agreed principles as follows:

*any tabled bills set out in the governing party&#x27;s manifesto may be subjected to possible short delay but pass; but anything else would be subject to full debate.

In its modern form, the convention:
*permits the offering of reasoned amendments to a motion for second reading of a Government bill, provided such amendments are not wrecking amendments designed to destroy the bill.

==Evolution==
===Liberal Democrat dissent in 2005===
After the Labour general election victory in 2005, the Liberal Democrats indicated that they did not feel bound by the Salisbury Convention as a result of decreasing voter turnout, the low share of the vote received by the Government, and the changes to the composition of the House of Lords introduced in 1999 by the Labour Government.

===Application to hung parliament coalitions and minority governments===
It is mooted that during minority governments and post-election coalitions in which the main party in government does not have a clear majority the Convention does not hold, somewhat enhancing the Lords&#x27; power to delay and suggest redrafting of bills.

Following the hung parliament in 2017, the government argued that the convention continued to apply. Baroness Evans of Bowes Park, Leader of the House of Lords, claimed that the convention applied to the Conservative manifesto, but not to their DUP confidence-and-supply partners. Baroness Smith of Basildon, Shadow Leader of the House of Lords, said it was &quot;far from clear that the Salisbury-Addison Convention was ever intended to apply to minority governments&quot;. Amendments made by the House of Lords to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 were described by some MPs, such as Bill Cash, as &quot;wrecking amendments&quot;, a view which was contested by Lords.

===Proposal to codify the Salisbury convention===
In 2006, Tony Blair appointed Lord Cunningham of Felling, to chair a joint committee (of both Houses) to investigate possibilities of formalising numerous conventions including the Salisbury Convention. The proposals were dropped in favour of maintaining such conventions as part of the more &quot;ad hoc&quot; unwritten constitution.

<doc id="523990" wikidata="Q5112358" url="?curid=523990" title="Christopher Fraser">
<text>Christopher James Fraser, OBE (born 25 October 1962) is a former British Conservative Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Mid Dorset and North Poole from the 1997 general election to 2001 and South West Norfolk from 2005 to 2010.

==Early life==
He was born in Hertfordshire and educated at the University of Westminster, graduating with a BA degree. He worked as chairman of a communications company. He was elected as a councillor to the Three Rivers District Council for four years from 1992.

==Parliamentary career==
Fraser was elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 general election for the new seat of Mid Dorset and North Poole with a majority of 681. He made his maiden speech on 4 July 1997. He lost his seat at the 2001 general election to the Liberal Democrat Annette Brooke. Although his percentage of the vote increased, Fraser was edged out by the Liberal Democrats by 384 votes, after a tactical voting campaign urging Dorset residents to cast their votes in the best way to defeat the incumbent Conservatives and saw his defeat, along with that of Ian Bruce in neighbouring South Dorset. He returned to Westminster at the 2005 general election for South West Norfolk following the retirement of the former Secretary of State for Education Gillian Shephard. He held the seat with a comfortable majority of 10,086, and managed to achieve a small swing of 0.3 over Labour.

He served as a member of the culture, media and sport select committee from 1997 until he lost his seat. He was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Lord Strathclyde, the Shadow Leader of the House of Lords. Following his re-election in 2005 he was a member of the Northern Ireland select committee and was appointed to the Northern Ireland Grand Committee. He was Chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Northern Ireland Group. He was a member of the UK delegation to the Council of Europe and the Assembly of the Western European Union (2005–2007).

In 2009 his expenses claims were highlighted in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;; according to the newspaper, Fraser claimed £1,800 in public money for buying 215 trees and marking out the boundary of his second home in the constituency. The Lynn News reported &quot;In February 2007 Mr Fraser claimed £1,808.28 for new fencing and hedging to provide security for his new constituency home.&quot;

On 28 May 2009 he announced that he would be standing down as an MP at the next general election citing family reasons.

The Telegraph 2010 election website stated that he &quot;stood down on account of his wife&#x27;s health problems&quot;.

Fraser was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for public and political service.

==Personal life==
Fraser married in February 1987 and he has a son and a daughter. He became a Freeman of the City of London in 1992. He receives income from land and property in London and Dorset.

<text>The British Columbia Party was a right-wing political party in the Canadian province of British Columbia, founded in 1998 as a populist party by John Motiuk, a North Vancouver lawyer.

The party did not nominate candidates in the 2001 provincial election. It nominated two candidates for the 2005 provincial election: David Andrew Wright, who won 185 votes (0.86% of the total) in Delta North, and Jack Kortmeyer, who won 169 votes (1.39% of the total) in Bulkley Valley-Stikine. It did not nominate candidates in the 2009 provincial election.

The party was one of five whose members merged to form the British Columbia Unity Party, but like all but one of the others, the party later left BC Unity.

The party ran three candidates in the 2013 general election: Carra-Lynn Hodgson in North Vancouver-Lonsdale, Trevor Hendry in Skeena, and Jim Laurence in Surrey-White Rock.

It did not nominate candidates in the 2017 general election.

==Leadership==
The party was led by former Social Credit leader Eric Buckley. Buckley was ousted by the party&#x27;s board of directors, and replaced by former Reform Party of BC Leader Wilf Hanni.

Hanni was subsequently ousted by the board and replaced by Grant Mitton. Mitton, a popular former radio talk show host, had run as a candidate for Social Credit in 2001, winning over 17% of the vote in his riding. He left the moribund Socreds to join the British Columbia Party as a &quot;traditional conservative party&quot;, hoping to attract support from conservatives, particularly social conservatives dissatisfied with the policies of the ruling British Columbia Liberal Party.

Mitton and Hanni left the BC Party, and joined the British Columbia Conservative Party.

==Party program==

===Founding philosophy===
The philosophy of the British Columbia Party is rooted in traditional conservatism: the protection and preservation of whatever is beneficial, respect for the individual, economic responsibility, and government which is enabling, not restrictive. Essential components of the philosophy:
# Honouring the will of the people as the highest authority in a democratic society, obeying the mandate of the majority while respecting the rights and opinions of the minority.
# Recognition that the individual is the most important element in an organized society, and that government must protect individual citizens&#x27; inalienable rights and remain responsive to their potential and their needs.
# Responsible management of public affairs by government, to achieve the objectives of the electorate, ensuring that what is physically possible and morally correct is financially viable.
# Security of person and property.
# Belief in the supremacy of God and the rule of law as declared in the Constitution of Canada.

===Policy and principles===

# While members of the legislature are responsible primarily to their constituents, they must vote in accordance with party principles. In issues not guided by party principles, they must be allowed to vote freely, in accordance with their consciences and the best interests of their constituents.
# The executive, legislative and judicial branches of government and all their members will be held fully accountable for the execution of their duties and all their activities in the public arena.
# The government is responsible for protecting the rights and freedoms of all citizens. These include the right to life; freedoms of religion, speech, assembly, association and movement; the right to own private property, and equality before the law.
# Taxes must be responsible and fair. A balanced budget must be maintained.
# The private sector is recognized as the most effective and equitable area for job creation and economic stability.
# A balanced labour/management relationship must be maintained to encourage investment and stimulate job creation.
# There must be simultaneous and coordinated management of natural resources and protection of the environment to provide maximum sustainable benefit for the citizens of British Columbia.
# Social security and supporting infrastructure must balance the roles of government, individuals and charities, with services provided efficiently and effectively.
# An educational system providing the highest standards of academic opportunities must be universally available, with full public funding for the education of every minor and freedom for parents to choose the mode of education most suitable to each child&#x27;s individual needs within that system.
# A comprehensive health care system must be based on accessibility and portability for the user, affordability and accountability for the government. Priority health care disbursements will be given to essential services.

<doc id="523995" wikidata="Q27764" url="?curid=523995" title="Louis Antoine de Saint-Just">
<text>Louis Antoine Léon de Saint-Just (; 25 August 176710 Thermidor, Year II [28 July 1794]), sometimes nicknamed the Archangel of Terror, was a French revolutionary, political philosopher, member and president of the French National Convention, a Jacobin club leader, and a major figure of the French Revolution. As the youngest member elected to the National Convention, Saint-Just belonged to the Mountain faction. A steadfast supporter and close friend of Robespierre, he was swept away in his downfall on 9 Thermidor, Year II.

Renowned for his eloquence, he stood out for the uncompromising nature and inflexibility of his principles advocating equality and virtue, as well as for the effectiveness of his missions during which he rectified the situation of the Army of the Rhine and contributed to the victory of the republican armies at Fleurus. Politically combating the Girondins, the Hebertists, and then the Indulgents, he pushed for the confiscation of the property of the enemies of the Republic for the benefit of poor patriots. He was the designated speaker for the Robespierrists in their conflicts with other political parties in the National Convention, launching accusations and requisitions against figures like Danton or Hébert. To prevent the massacres for which the sans-culottes were responsible in the departments, particularly in Vendée, or to centralize repression (a point still unclear), he had the departmental revolutionary tribunals abolished and consolidated all procedures at the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris.

He was also a political theorist, and notably inspired the Constitution of Year I, and the attached Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1793. He also authored works on the principles of the French Revolution.

On the 9th Thermidor, he defended Robespierre against accusations made by Barère and Tallien. Arrested alongside him, he remained silent until his death the following day, when he was guillotined on the Place de la Révolution with the 104 Robespierrists executed, at the age of 26. His body and head were then thrown into a mass grave.

The dark legend surrounding this figure, and Robespierrists in general, persisted in historical research until the second half of the 20th century, before gradually being reassessed from that period onward by more recent historians. Until then, he was perceived as cruel, bloodthirsty, and having a wild and violent sexuality.

==Early life==
Louis Antoine de Saint-Just was born in Decize in the former Nivernais province of central France. He was the eldest child of Louis Jean de Saint-Just de Richebourg (1716–1777), a retired French cavalry officer (and knight of the Order of Saint Louis), and Marie-Anne Robinot (1736–1811), the daughter of a notary. He had two younger sisters, born in 1768 and 1769. The family later moved north and in 1776 settled in the village of Blérancourt in the former Picardy province, establishing themselves as a countryside noble family living off the rents from their land. A year after the move, Louis Antoine&#x27;s father died, leaving his mother with their three children. She saved diligently for her only son&#x27;s education, and in 1779 he was sent to the Oratorian school at Soissons. After a promising start, his teachers soon viewed Saint-Just as a troublemaker, a reputation later compounded by infamous stories (almost certainly apocryphal) of how he led a students&#x27; rebellion and tried to burn down the school. Nonetheless, he graduated in 1786.

His restive nature, however, did not diminish. As a young man, Saint-Just was &quot;wild, handsome [and] transgressive&quot;. He reportedly showed a special affection towards a young woman of Blérancourt, Thérèse Gellé. She was the daughter of a wealthy notary, a powerful and autocratic figure in the town; he was still an undistinguished adolescent. He is said to have proposed marriage to her, which she is said to have desired. Though no evidence of their relationship exists, official records show that on 25 July 1786, Thérèse was married to Emmanuel Thorin, the scion of a prominent local family. Saint-Just was out of town and unaware of the event, and tradition portrays him as brokenhearted. Whatever his true state, it is known that a few weeks after the marriage he abruptly left home for Paris unannounced, having gathered up a pair of pistols and a good quantity of his mother&#x27;s silver. His venture ended when his mother had him seized by police and sent to a reformatory (&quot;maison de correction&quot;) where he stayed from September 1786 to March 1787. Upon returning, Saint-Just attempted to begin anew: he enrolled as a student at Reims University&#x27;s School of Law. After a year, however, he drifted away from law school and returned to his mother&#x27;s home in Blérancourt penniless, without any occupational prospects.

===&quot;Organt&quot;===

Saint-Just had shown a precocious fascination with literature, and he wrote works of his own including a one-act play &quot;Arlequin Diogène&quot;. During his stay at the reformatory, he began writing a lengthy poem that he published anonymously more than two years later in May 1789 at the very outbreak of the Revolution. The 21-year-old Saint-Just thereby added his own touch to the social tumult of the times with &quot;Organt, poem in twenty cantos&quot;. The poem, a medieval epic fantasy relaying the quest of young Antoine Organt, extols the virtues of primitive man, praising his libertinism and independence whilst blaming all present-day troubles on modern inequalities of wealth and power. Written in a style mimicking Ariosto, the work foreshadowed its author&#x27;s future political extremism. Spiked with brutal satire and scandalous pornographic episodes, it also unmistakably attacked the monarchy, the nobility, and the Church.

Contemporaries regarded &quot;Organt&quot; as a salacious novelty and it was quickly banned. Nevertheless, censors who tried to confiscate copies discovered that few were available anywhere. It did not sell well and resulted in a financial loss for its author. The public&#x27;s taste for literature had shifted in the prelude to the Revolution, and Saint-Just&#x27;s taste shifted along with it: he devoted his future writing almost entirely to unadorned essays of sociopolitical theory, aside from a few pages of an unfinished novel found amidst his papers at the end of his life. With his previous ambitions of literary and lawyerly fame unfulfilled, Saint-Just directed his focus on the single goal of revolutionary command.

==Early revolutionary career==

The rapid development of the Revolution in 1789 upended Blérancourt&#x27;s traditional power structure. The notary Gellé, previously an undisputed town leader, was challenged by a group of reformists who were led by several of Saint-Just&#x27;s friends, including the husband of his sister Louise. Their attempts were unsuccessful until 1790 when Blérancourt held its first open municipal elections. Mandated by the National Constituent Assembly, the new electoral structure allowed Saint-Just&#x27;s friends to assume authority in the village as mayor, secretary, and, in the case of his brother-in-law, head of the local National Guard. Despite not meeting the legal age and tax qualifications, the jobless Saint-Just was allowed to join the Guard.

He immediately exhibited the ruthless discipline for which he would be famous. Within a few months he was the commanding officer, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. At local meetings he moved attendees with his patriotic zeal and flair: in one much-repeated story, Saint-Just brought the town council to tears by thrusting his hand into the flame of a burning anti-revolutionary pamphlet, swearing his devotion to the Republic. He had powerful allies when he sought to become a member of his district’s electoral assembly. He initiated correspondence with well-known leaders of the Revolution like Camille Desmoulins. Mid August 1790, he wrote to Robespierre for the first time, expressing his admiration and asking him to consider a local petition. The letter was filled with the highest of praise, beginning: &quot;You, who uphold our tottering country against the torrent of despotism and intrigue; you whom I know, as I know God, only through his miracles...&quot;

===&quot;L&#x27;Esprit de la Revolution&quot;===
While Saint-Just waited for the next election, he composed an extensive work, &quot;L&#x27;Esprit de la Revolution et de la constitution de France&quot;, published in the spring of 1791. His writing style had shed all satire and now reflected the stern and moralizing tone of classical Romans so adored by French revolutionaries. It presented a set of principles deeply influenced by Montesquieu, and remained fully confined to a paradigm of constitutional monarchy. He expressed abhorrence at the violence in the Revolution thus far, and he disdained the character of those who partook in it as little more than &quot;riotous slaves.&quot; Instead, he heaped his praise upon the people&#x27;s representatives in the Legislative Assembly, whose sober virtue would guide the Revolution best. Spread out over five books, &quot;L&#x27;Esprit de la Revolution&quot; is inconsistent in many of its assertions but still shows clearly that Saint-Just no longer saw government as oppressive to man&#x27;s nature but necessary to its success: its ultimate object was to &quot;edge society in the direction of the distant ideal.&quot;

The new work, like its predecessor, attracted minimal readership. On 21 June 1791, just days after it was published, all attention became focused on King Louis XVI&#x27;s ill-fated flight to Varennes. Saint-Just&#x27;s theories about constitutional monarchy were suddenly outdated. The episode fostered public anger toward the King which simmered all year until a Parisian mob finally attacked the Tuileries Palace on 10 August 1792. In response, the Assembly declared itself ready to step down ahead of schedule and called for a new election, this one under universal male suffrage. The timing was excellent for Saint-Just, who turned the legal age of 25 before the end of the month. The fear inspired by the invasion of the Tuileries made most of his opponents retire from the scene. Guard commander Saint-Just was able to win election as one of the deputies for the &quot;département&quot; of Aisne. He left for Paris to join the National Convention as the youngest of its 749 members.

==Deputy to the Convention==
Among the deputies, Saint-Just was watchful but interacted little at first. He joined the Parisian Jacobin Club, but he remained aloof from Girondins and Montagnards alike. He waited until 13 November 1792 to give his first speech to the Convention, but when he did the effect was spectacular. What brought him to the lectern was the discussion over how to treat the deposed King. In dramatic contrast to the earlier speakers, Saint-Just delivered a blazing condemnation of him. He demanded &quot;Louis Capet should be judged not as a king or even a citizen, but as a traitor, an enemy who deserves death. &quot;As for me,&quot; he declared, &quot;I see no middle ground: this man must reign or die! He oppressed a free nation; he declared himself its enemy; he abused the laws: he must die to assure the repose of the people, since it was in his mind to crush the people to assure his own.&quot; Towards the end of his speech, he uttered an ominous observation: &quot;No one can reign innocently.&quot;

The young deputy&#x27;s speech electrified the Convention. Saint-Just was interrupted frequently by bursts of applause. Robespierre was particularly impressed—he spoke from the lectern the next day in terms almost identical to those of Saint-Just, and their views became the official position of the Jacobins. By December, that position had become law: the King was taken to a trial before the Convention, sentenced to death, and executed by guillotine on 21 January 1793.

On 29/30 May 1793 Saint-Just was added to the Committee of Public Safety; Couthon became secretary, which was one day before the Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June.

==Constitution of 1793==
Because the first French Constitution had included a role for the king, it was long since invalid and needed to be updated for the Republic. Many drafts had circulated within the Convention since Louis XVI&#x27;s execution, and Saint-Just submitted his own lengthy proposal on 24 April 1793. His draft incorporated the most common assertions of the others: the right to vote, the right to petition, and equal eligibility for employment were among the basic principles that made his draft tenable. He stood out from the pack, however, on the issue of elections: Saint-Just argued against all complex voting systems, and supported only the classical style of a simple majority of citizens in a nationwide vote. Amid a flurry of proposals by other deputies, Saint-Just held inflexibly to his &quot;one man one vote&quot; plan, and this conspicuous homage to Greco-Roman traditions (which were particularly prized and idealized in French culture during the Revolution) enhanced his political cachet. When no plan gained enough votes to pass, a compromise was made which tasked a small body of deputies as official constitutional draftsmen. Saint-Just was among the five elected members. In recognition of the importance of their mission, the draftsmen were all added to the powerful new Committee of Public Safety.

The Convention had given the Committee extraordinary authority to provide for state security since the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War in early 1793. Committee members were originally intended to serve for periods of only thirty days before replacements were elected, so they needed to work quickly. Saint-Just took charge of the issue and led the development of the French Constitution of 1793. Before the end of his first term the new document was completed, submitted to the Convention, and ratified as law on 24 June 1793.

The new constitution was never implemented. Emergency measures for wartime were in effect, and those measures called for a moratorium on constitutional democracy. Wartime gave supreme power to the sitting Convention, with the Committee of Public Safety at the top of its subordinate administrative pyramid. Robespierre, with Saint-Just&#x27;s assistance, fought vigorously to ensure that the government would remain under emergency measures—&quot;revolutionary&quot;—until victory.

==Arrest of the Girondins==
During the time that Saint-Just was working on the constitution, dramatic political warfare was taking place. The &quot;sans-culottes&quot;—deemed &quot;the people&quot; by many radicals, and represented by the Paris Commune—had grown antipathetic to the moderate Girondins. On 2 June 1793, in a mass action supported by National Guardsmen, they surrounded the Convention and arrested the Girondin deputies. The other deputies—even the Montagnards, who had long enjoyed an informal alliance with the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;—resented the action but felt compelled politically to permit it. The Girondin leader, Jacques Pierre Brissot, was indicted for treason and scheduled for trial, but the other &quot;Brissotins&quot; were imprisoned (or pursued) without formal charges. The Convention debated their fate and the political disorder lasted for weeks. Saint-Just had previously remained silent about the Girondins, but now clearly stood with Robespierre who had been thoroughly opposed to most of them for a long time. When the initial indictment by the Committee was served, it was Saint-Just who delivered the report to the Convention.

In its secret negotiations, the Committee of Public Safety was initially unable to form a consensus concerning the jailed deputies, but as some Girondins fled to the provinces and attempted to incite an insurrection, its opinion hardened. By early July, Saint-Just was able to address the Convention with a lengthy report in the name of the Committee. His damning attack left no room for any further conciliation. The Girondins&#x27; trials must proceed, he said, and any verdicts must be severe. The proceedings dragged on for months, but Brissot and twenty of his allies were eventually condemned and sent to the guillotine on 31 October 1793. Saint-Just used their situation to gain approval for intimidating new laws, culminating in the Law of Suspects (17 September 1793) which gave the Committee vast new powers of arrest and influence.

==Military commissar==
On 10 October the Convention decreed to recognize the Committee of Public Safety as the supreme &quot;Revolutionary Government&quot;, (which was consolidated on 4 December). The provisional government would be revolutionary until peace according to Saint-Just. Saint-Just proposed that deputies from the Convention should directly oversee all military efforts, a proposal which was approved on 10 October 1793. Amid worsening conditions at the front in the fall of that year, several deputies were designated &quot;représentant en mission&quot; and sent to the critical area of Alsace to shore up the disintegrating Army of the Rhine. Results were not sufficiently forthcoming, so at the end of the month Saint-Just was sent there along with an ally from the Convention, Philippe-François-Joseph Le Bas. The mission lasted from November through December 1793. The two men were charged with &quot;extraordinary powers&quot; to impose discipline and reorganize the troops.

From the start, Saint-Just dominated the mission. He was relentless in demanding results from the commanders as well as sympathetic to the complaints of common soldiers. On his first day at the front, he issued a proclamation promising &quot;examples of justice and severity as the Army has not yet witnessed.&quot; The entire army was placed immediately under the harshest discipline. Within a short time, many officers were dismissed and many more, including at least one general, were executed by firing squad.

Among soldiers and civilians alike, Saint-Just repressed opponents of the Revolution, but he did not agree to the mass executions ordered by some of the other deputies on the mission. He vetoed much of the deputies&#x27; work and had many of them recalled to Paris. Local politicians were just as vulnerable to him: even Eulogius Schneider, the powerful leader of Alsace&#x27;s largest city, Strasbourg, was arrested on Saint-Just&#x27;s order, and much equipment was commandeered for the army. Saint-Just worked closely only with General Charles Pichegru, a reliable Jacobin whom he respected. Under Saint-Just&#x27;s unblinking surveillance, Pichegru and General Lazare Hoche ably secured the frontier and began an invasion of the German Rhineland.

With the army revitalized, Saint-Just returned briefly to Paris where his success was applauded. However, there was little time to celebrate. He was quickly sent back to the front lines, this time in Belgium where the Army of the North was experiencing the same problems of discipline and organization. During January and February 1794, he again delivered results ruthlessly and effectively, but after less than a month the mission was cut short. As Paris convulsed in political violence, Robespierre required his assistance.

==President of the Convention==
With the republican army advancing and the Girondins destroyed, the left-wing Montagnards, led by the Jacobins and Robespierre, controlled the Convention. In these circumstances, on the first day of Ventôse in Year II of the Revolution (19 February 1794), Saint-Just was elected President of the National Convention for the next two weeks.

With this new power he persuaded the chamber to pass the radical Ventôse Decrees, under which the régime would confiscate aristocratic &quot;émigré&quot; property and distribute it to needy &quot;sans-culottes&quot; (commoners). But these acts of wealth redistribution, arguably the most revolutionary of the French Revolution, never went into operation. The Committee faltered in creating procedures for their enforcement, and the frantic pace of unfolding political events left them behind.

Opponents of the Jacobins saw the Ventôse Decrees as a cynical ploy to appeal to the militant extreme left. Sincere or not, Saint-Just made impassioned arguments for them. One week after their adoption, he urged that the Decrees be exercised vigorously and hailed them for ushering in a new era: &quot;Eliminate the poverty that dishonors a free state; the property of patriots is sacred but the goods of conspirators are there for the wretched. The wretched are the powerful of the earth; they have the right to speak as masters to the governments who neglect them.&quot;

==Arrest of the Hébertists==
As the spring of 1794 approached, the Committee of Public Safety, led by Robespierre, Saint-Just, and Georges Couthon, exercised near complete control over the government. Despite the vast reach of their powers, however, rivals and enemies remained. One of the thorniest problems, at least to Robespierre, was populist agitator Jacques Hébert, who discharged torrents of criticism against perceived bourgeois Jacobinism in his newspaper, &quot;Le Père Duchesne&quot;. Ultra-radical Hébertists in the Cordeliers Club undermined Jacobin efforts to court and manage the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;, and the most extreme Hébertists even called openly for insurrection.

Saint-Just, in his role as president of the Convention, announced unequivocally that &quot;whoever vilified or attacked the dignity of the revolutionary government should be condemned to death&quot;. The Convention agreed in a vote on 13 Ventôse Year II (3 March 1794). Robespierre joined Saint-Just in his attacks on Hébert. Hébert and his closest associates were arrested the following day. A little over a week later, Saint-Just told the Convention that the Hébertists&#x27; activities were part of a foreign plot against the government. The accused were sent to face the Revolutionary Tribunal. Saint-Just vowed, &quot;No more pity, no weakness towards the guilty... Henceforth the government will pardon no more crimes.&quot; On 4 Germinal (24 March 1794), the Tribunal sent Hébert, Charles-Philippe Ronsin, François-Nicolas Vincent, and most other prominent Hébertists to the guillotine.

==Arrest of the Dantonists==
The ongoing political combat—bloody enough since at least the time of the arrest of the Girondins to be known as the Reign of Terror—spread inexorably. After the Hébertists fell, attention turned on the Indulgents, starting with Fabre d&#x27;Églantine and Robespierre&#x27;s once-close friend Georges Danton. Danton was among the most vocal of the moderates who opposed the Committee. He was especially opposed to Saint Just’s fanaticism and &quot;extravagant&quot; use of violence. On 30 March the two committees decided to arrest Danton and the Indulgents after Saint-Just became uncharacteristically angry. On 31 March Saint-Just publicly attacked both. In the Convention criticism was voiced against the arrests, which Robespierre silenced with &quot;...whoever trembles at this moment is guilty.&quot;

Danton’s criticism of the Terror won him some support, but a financial scandal involving the French East India Company provided a pretext for his downfall. Robespierre again sent Saint-Just to the Convention to deliver a Committee report (31 March 1794) in which he announced the arrest of Danton and &quot;the last partisans of royalism&quot;. In addition to charges of corruption related to the trading company, Saint-Just accused Danton of conspiring to restore the monarchy. He denounced him as a &quot;bad citizen&quot;, a &quot;false friend&quot;, and a &quot;wicked man&quot;. Danton continued to demand the right to call witnesses. Saint-Just went to the Convention and told them that the prisoners were fomenting insurrection against the court. After a tumultuous trial, described by some as a show-trial, Fabre, Desmoulins, and other top supporters of Danton went to the scaffold with their leader on 16 Germinal (5 April 1794). In his report, Saint-Just had promised that this would be a &quot;final cleansing&quot; of the Republic&#x27;s enemies. However, there is evidence to suggest that Saint-Just was becoming uneasy about the progressions of these events. He privately wrote that “The Revolution is frozen; all principles are weakened.&quot;

The violent removal of the Hébertists and Dantonists provided only a mirage of stability. Their deaths caused deep resentment in the Convention, and their absence only made it more difficult for the Jacobins to influence the dangerously unpredictable masses of &quot;sans-culottes&quot;. The elimination of popular demagogues and the consequent loss of support in the streets would prove disastrous for Saint-Just, Robespierre, and other Jacobins during the events of Thermidor.

As the deliverer of Committee reports, Saint-Just served as the public face of the Terror, and later writers dubbed him the &quot;Angel of Death&quot;. On 23 April Saint-Just helped create a new bureau of &quot;general police&quot; for the Committee of Public Safety which matched—and usurped—the powers that had been given officially to the Committee of General Security. Shortly after its establishment, however, administration of the new bureau passed to Robespierre when Saint-Just left Paris once more for the front lines.

==Last days==
The Revolutionary army was still in a defensive posture, and Saint-Just was sent back to Belgium to help prepare for the coming conflict. From April through June 1794, he again took supreme oversight of the Army of the North and contributed to the victory at Fleurus. This hotly contested battle on 26 June 1794 saw Saint-Just apply his most draconian measures, ordering all French soldiers who turned away from the enemy to be summarily shot. He felt vindicated when the victory sent the Austrians and their allies into a full retreat from all the Southern Netherlands. Fleurus marked the turning point in the War of the First Coalition: France remained on the offensive until its eventual victory in 1797. After his return from the battle, Saint-Just was treated as a hero and &quot;cheered from all sides&quot;.

After returning to Paris, Saint-Just discovered that Robespierre&#x27;s political position had degraded significantly. As the Terror reached its apogee—the so-called &quot;Great Terror&quot;—the danger of a counter strike by his enemies became almost inevitable. Carnot described Saint-Just and Robespierre as &quot;ridiculous dictators&quot;. Saint-Just, however, remained unshakable in his alliance with Robespierre. The French victory at Fleurus and others which followed, reduced (in the eyes of some) the need for national security during the war, which originally had been predicated as a justification for the Terror. &quot;The excuse for the Terror was at an end&quot;. Opponents of the Terror used Saint-Just&#x27;s own words against him by demanding a full implementation of the constitution of 1793.

With political combat reaching a fever pitch, the Committee introduced a bill to establish a newer version of the &quot;Law of Suspects&quot;—the Law of 22 Prairial. The law established a new category of &quot;enemies of the people&quot; in terms so vague that virtually anyone could be accused and convicted. Defendants were not permitted legal counsel, and the Revolutionary Tribunal was instructed to impose no sentence other than death. Robespierre swiftly shepherded the bill into law, and although Saint-Just was not directly involved in its composition, he was almost certainly supportive. Vastly expanding the Tribunal’s power, the new statutes catalyzed the Great Terror: in the first month they were in effect, the number of executions in Paris rose from an average of five daily to seventeen daily, soaring in the following month to twenty-six.
The Law of Prairial was the breaking point for opponents of the Committee. For the second time, Carnot described Saint-Just and Robespierre as &quot;ridiculous dictators&quot;. Carnot and Cambon proposed to end the terror. On 22 and 23 July, the two committees met in a plenary session. The Commune published a new maximum, limiting the wages of employees (in some cases halving them) which provoked a sharp protest in the sections. Almost all the workers in Paris were on strike.

Resistance to the Terror spread throughout the Convention, and Saint-Just was compelled to address the division. Saint-Just declared in negotiations with Barère that he was prepared to make concessions on the subordinate position of the Committee of General Security. Bertrand Barère and other Thermidorians claimed that he was trying to propose that Robespierre and those aligned with him have dictatorial authority. In return, Saint-Just supported Carnot&#x27;s decision to send companies of gunners out of Paris. However, for a time some of the Thermidorians nevertheless considered Saint-Just to be redeemable, or at the very least useful for their own ambitions. Their attitude toward him shifted later when he delivered an uncompromising public defense of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794).

They set off to the Committee of Public Safety, where they found Saint-Just working. They asked him if he was drawing up their bill of indictment. Saint-Just promised to show them his speech before the session began. He replied he sent the beginning to a friend and refused to show them his notes. Collot d&#x27;Herbois, who chaired the Convention, decided not to let him speak and to make sure he could not be heard on the next day. According to Barère: &quot;We never deceived ourselves that Saint-Just, cut out as a more dictatorial boss, would have ended up overthrowing him to put himself in his place; we also knew that we stood in the way of his projects and that he would have us guillotined; we had him stopped&quot;.

===Thermidor===


At noon, Saint-Just went straight to the convention, likely prepared to place blame on Billaud, Collot d&#x27;Herbois and Carnot. He began: &quot;I am from no faction; I will contend against them all&quot;. Billaud-Varennes complained about how he was treated in the Jacobin club on the evening before and that Saint-Just had not kept his promise to show his speech before the meeting. As the accusations began to pile up, Saint-Just remained silent. During the ensuing debate he was accused by his fellow deputy Fréron of forming a triumvirate with Robespierre and Couthon, a reference to the first triumvirate of Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus which led to the end of the Roman Republic. Finally, several of them physically shoved him away from the lectern, and each started his own address in which they called for the removal of Robespierre and all his supporters. Amid the uproar, recalled Barras, Saint-Just &quot;did not leave the platform, in spite of the interruptions which would have driven any one else away. He only came down a few steps, then mounted again, to continue his discourse proudly... Motionless, unmoved, he seemed to defy everyone with his calm&quot;.

Saint-Just saved his dignity at the lectern but not his life. Rising in his support, Robespierre sputtered and lost his voice; his brother Augustin, Philippe Lebas, and other key allies all tried swaying the deputies, but failed. The meeting ended with an order for their arrest. Saint-Just was taken to the &quot;Écossais&quot;. After several hours, however, the five were invited to take refuge in the Hôtel de Ville by the mayor. At around 11 p.m., Saint-Just was delivered. At around 2 a.m., Barras and Bourdon, accompanied by several members of the Convention, arrived in two columns. When Grenadiers broke inside, a number of the defeated Jacobins tried to commit suicide. The unperturbed Saint-Just gave himself up without a word. Among the captured, &quot;only St. Just, his hands bound but his head held high, was able to walk&quot;. Robespierre, Saint-Just, and twenty of their associates were guillotined the next day, and Saint-Just reputedly accepted his death with coolness and pride. As a last formality of identification, he gestured to a copy of the Constitution of 1793 and said, &quot;I am the one who made that&quot;. Saint-Just and his guillotined associates were buried in the Errancis Cemetery, a common place of interment for those executed during the Revolution. In the mid-19th century, their skeletal remains were transferred to the Catacombs of Paris.

==Legacy==
===Other writings===
Throughout his political career, Saint-Just continued to work on books and essays about the meaning of the Revolution, but he did not survive to see any of them published. In later years, these drafts and notes were put together in various collections along with &quot;Organt&quot;, &quot;Arlequin Diogène&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Esprit de la Revolution&quot;, public speeches, military orders, and private correspondence.

Many of Saint-Just&#x27;s legislative proposals were compiled after his death to form an outline for a communal and egalitarian society. They were published as a single volume, &quot;Fragments sur les institutions républicaines.&quot; The proposals were far more radical than the Constitution of 1793, and identify closely with the legendarily fearsome traditions of ancient Sparta. Saint-Just proposed the electoral system now known as Single non-transferable voting in 1793 in a proposal to the French National Convention. His suggestion was to have the whole country as one multi-seat district and each voter having just one vote. It was not adopted in France at that time.

Many of his proposals are interpreted as proto-socialist precepts: the overarching theme is equality, which Saint-Just at one point summarizes as: &quot;Man must be independent... There should be neither rich nor poor&quot;.

====&quot;De la Nature&quot;====
Saint-Just also composed a lengthy draft of his philosophical views, &quot;De la Nature&quot;, which remained hidden in obscurity until its transcription by Albert Soboul in 1951. He first published this work in 1951 under the title &quot;Un manuscrit oublié de Saint-Just&quot; in the &quot;Annales historiques de la révolution française&quot;, No. 124. Alain Liénard&#x27;s &quot;Saint-Just, théorie politique&quot; and later collections include an expanded version. &quot;De la Nature&quot; outlines Saint-Just&#x27;s ideas on the nature of society; the actual date it was written is disputed, but the most agreed upon range is between 1791 and 1792.

Based on the assumption that man is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature there is no need for contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the larger social good. Outside the government itself, Saint-Just asserts there must be full equality between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must own property.

===Character===
Ambitious and active-minded, Saint-Just worked urgently and tirelessly towards his goals: he wrote that &quot;For Revolutionists there is no rest but in the tomb&quot;. He was repeatedly described by contemporaries as arrogant, believing himself to be a skilled leader and orator as well as having proper revolutionary character. Detractors claimed he had a superiority complex and always &quot;made it clear… that he considered himself to be in charge and that his will was law&quot;. Camille Desmoulins wrote of Saint-Just, &quot;He carries his head like a sacred host&quot;.

Saint-Just&#x27;s rise to prominence wrought a remarkable change in his personality. Freewheeling and passionate in his youth, Saint-Just quickly became focused on the revolutionary cause, described by one author &quot;tyrannical and pitilessly thorough&quot;. He became &quot;the ice-cold ideologist of republican purity&quot;, &quot;as inaccessible as stone to all the warm passions&quot;. A measure of his change can be inferred from the experience of his former love interest Thérèse, who is known to have left her husband and taken up residence in a Parisian neighborhood near Saint-Just in late 1793. Saint-Just—who had already developed something of a relationship, tepid but potentially expedient, with the sister of his colleague Le Bas—refused to see her. Thérèse stayed there for over a year, returning to Blérancourt only after Saint-Just was dead. No record exists of any exchanges they might have had, but Saint-Just is known to have written to a friend complaining impatiently about the rumors connecting him to &quot;citizen Thorin&quot;.

In his public speaking, Saint-Just was even more daring and outspoken than his mentor Robespierre. Regarding France&#x27;s internal strife, he spared few: &quot;You have to punish not only the traitors, but even those who are indifferent; you have to punish whoever is passive in the republic, and who does nothing for it&quot;. He thought the only way to create a true republic was to rid it of enemies, to enforce the &quot;complete destruction of its opposite&quot;. Regarding the war, he declared without regret to the Convention, &quot;The vessel of the Revolution can arrive in port only on a sea reddened with torrents of blood&quot;. He urged the deputies to embrace the notion that &quot;a nation generates itself only upon heaps of corpses&quot;.

Despite his flaws, Saint-Just is often accorded respect for the strength of his convictions. Although his words and actions may be viewed by some as reprehensible, his commitment to them is rarely questioned: he was &quot;implacable but sincere&quot;. Like Robespierre, he was incorruptible in the sense that he exhibited no attraction to material benefits but devoted himself entirely to the advancement of a political agenda.

====Camus and Saint-Just====
In Albert Camus&#x27;s &quot;The Rebel&quot; (1951), Saint-Just is discussed extensively in the context of an analysis of rebellion and man&#x27;s progression towards enlightenment and freedom. Camus identifies Saint-Just&#x27;s successful argument for the execution of Louis XVI as the moment of death for monarchical divine right, a Nietzschean &quot;Twilight of the Idols&quot;. Saint-Just&#x27;s dedication to &quot;the sovereignty of the people and the sacred power of laws&quot; is described as &quot;a source of absolutism&quot; and indeed &quot;the new God&quot;. His kind of &quot;deification of the political&quot; is examined as the source of the creeping totalitarianism which grew so powerfully in Camus&#x27; own lifetime. Camus also references Saint-Just in &quot;The Plague&quot; (1947).

====In popular culture====
Representations of Saint-Just include those found in the novels &quot;Stello&quot; (1832) by Alfred de Vigny, &quot;A Place of Greater Safety&quot; (1992) by Hilary Mantel, and The Sandman comic &quot;Thermidor&quot; by Neil Gaiman; as well as in the plays &quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot; (1835, by Georg Büchner) and &quot;Poor Bitos&quot; (&quot;Pauvre Bitos, ou Le dîner de têtes&quot;, 1956, by Jean Anouilh). In Victor Hugo&#x27;s 1862 novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, the revolutionary character Enjolras is compared to Saint-Just: &quot;On Aventine Hill, he would have been Gracchus; in the Convention, he would have been Saint-Just.&quot; Saint-Just’s quote, “Nobody can rule guiltlessly,” appears as an epigraph before chapter one in Arthur Koestler’s 1941 anti-totalitarian novel &quot;Darkness At Noon&quot;. In film, Saint-Just has been portrayed by Abel Gance in &quot;Napoléon&quot; (1927); Jess Barker in &quot;Reign of Terror&quot; (1949); Patrice Alexsandre in &quot;Saint-Just and the Force of Things&quot; (1975);Bogusław Linda in &quot;Danton&quot; (1983); and Christopher Thompson in &quot;La Révolution française&quot; (1989). Jean-Pierre Léaud plays a farcical caricature of Saint-Just in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Week End&quot; (1967).

<text>William John Gunnell (1 October 1933 – 28 January 2008) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom.

==Early life==
He was born in Birmingham, and educated at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham. He gained a BSc in General Studies in 1955, and a PGCE in 1958 from the University of Leeds. As a conscientious objector during National Service he was a hospital porter at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, London. In the 1960s he was a chemistry teacher at the United Nations International School in New York City. From 1970 to 1988 he was a Lecturer in the School of Education at the University of Leeds.

From 1977 to 1986 he was a councillor on West Yorkshire County Council, being the leader 1981–86. He was also a councillor on Leeds City Council 1986–92.

==Parliamentary career==
Gunnell initially stood for Parliament at Leeds North East in February and October 1974, but was beaten by Sir Keith Joseph on both attempts.

At the 1992 election he was returned as Member of Parliament (MP) for Morley and Leeds South. That constituency was abolished at the 1997 election, and he was re-elected for the new Morley and Rothwell constituency. At the 2001 election he retired due to ill-health, and the seat was held for Labour by Colin Challen.

==Personal life==
He was married with three sons and one daughter. He was a keen follower of sport, being a Member of both Yorkshire and Warwickshire County Cricket Clubs. He supported West Bromwich Albion Football Club as a child and watched most of Leeds United&#x27;s home games between 1970 and 2005.

Gunnell died on 28 January 2008 in Wakefield aged 74.

<doc id="524002" wikidata="Q1929744" url="?curid=524002" title="Mike Watson, Baron Watson of Invergowrie">
<text>Michael Goodall Watson, Baron Watson of Invergowrie (born 1 May 1949), is a British Labour Party politician. He has served in two legislatures in the United Kingdom and served as Minister for Culture and Sport in the Scottish Executive Cabinet, and a convicted criminal.

Watson was expelled from his party on 22 September 2005 following his conviction and imprisonment for fire-raising at Prestonfield House, but was re-admitted to the Labour Party in July 2012. He currently sits as a Labour member of the House of Lords and is an Associate Director of the Edinburgh public affairs and communications company Caledonia Consulting.

On 18 September 2015, the new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn appointed Watson as Education spokesman in the House of Lords.

==Early life==

Watson was born in Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, but his family moved to Invergowrie, Perth and Kinross when he was very young. He was educated at Invergowrie Primary School, the High School of Dundee and Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, graduating with a B.A. Hons in Economics and Industrial Relations in 1974.

Prior to entering politics Watson worked as a tutor/organiser for the Workers&#x27; Educational Association and in the trade union movement, for the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs (ASTMS) and the Manufacturing, Science and Finance union (MSF).

==Political career==
Watson was elected to the Parliament of the United Kingdom as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Central at a by-election in 1989, following the death of Bob McTaggart MP. He was re-elected in the 1992 election and represented that constituency until it was abolished in 1997. He sought the nomination from the Labour party to run for the Govan seat at the 1997 election, but after initially winning the nomination by one vote, he lost a re-run to Mohammad Sarwar.

On 6 November 1997, he was created a life peer as Baron Watson of Invergowrie, of Invergowrie in Perth and Kinross.

In 1999 Lord Watson was elected as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow Cathcart constituency and was re-elected in 2003. On 20 July 1999 Watson announced his intention to introduce the &quot;Protection of Wild Mammals&quot; bill as a member&#x27;s bill to the Scottish Parliament to outlaw fox hunting. The bill passed a vote 83–36 on 13 February 2002 and received Royal Assent on 15 March, becoming the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 and becoming law on 1 August. This was a precursor to the Hunting Act 2004 banning fox hunting in England and Wales.

When Jack McConnell became First Minister in 2001, Watson entered the Scottish Executive as Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport. He left the Executive in 2003, having lost his position in a reshuffle after the 2003 election. He subsequently became deputy convener of the enterprise and culture committee.

On 15 November 2004, Watson was charged with wilful fire raising, and the Labour whip was withdrawn from him in the Holyrood and Westminster parliaments. On 1 September 2005 he admitted the offence and resigned from the Scottish Parliament. Watson was also expelled from the Labour Party when the sentence was announced. After serving a prison sentence he was released in May 2006.

In January 2007 Watson was appointed as an Associate Director with Caledonia Consulting, while also attending the House of Lords on a regular basis. Watson was re-admitted to membership of the Labour Party in July 2012, after a vote of the National Executive Committee. In September 2015, Jeremy Corbyn appointed Watson as the Labour spokesman on education in the Lords.

==Fire-raising conviction==
On 15 November 2004, Lord Watson was charged with two counts of &quot;wilful fire raising&quot; after a private reception at Edinburgh&#x27;s Prestonfield Hotel following the Scottish Politician of the Year awards on 11 November. The first alleged that he set fire to a curtain in the hotel&#x27;s reception, and the second that he set fire to a curtain in the hotel&#x27;s Yellow Room. On being charged, the Labour whip was suspended in the Holyrood and Westminster parliaments.

After initially registering not guilty pleas to both charges on 23 August 2005, he changed his plea on 1 September to guilty on the first count, and had a not guilty plea accepted on the second charge.

On the same day that Lord Watson admitted his guilt, he resigned from the Scottish Parliament. He resigned as a director of Dundee United Football Club. It was not possible for a life peer to resign from the House of Lords at that time and there was no provision for peers convicted of criminal offences to be stripped of their titles. Such legislation was last proposed following the conviction of Jeffrey Archer for perjury in 2001, but rejected. The House of Lords Reform Act 2014 made resignation possible.

On 22 September 2005, Lord Watson was sentenced to 16 months&#x27; imprisonment. Sheriff Kathrine Mackie justified the sentence, stating that there was both &quot;a significant risk of re-offending&quot; and that Lord Watson offered no explanation. She also told Lord Watson that consumption of alcohol &quot;neither excuses nor fully explains your behaviour&quot;. The sentence was reduced from 20 months to 16 because Watson had pleaded guilty before the case reached trial. Watson appealed against his sentence on 23 March 2006 but the appeal judges refused to cut the term, and he was returned to prison. After serving half of his sentence (eight months), he was released on 23 May 2006.

== Views on Jeremy Corbyn ==

In an interview with The House magazine in March 2017, Lord Watson was asked whether Labour could win a UK general election under Jeremy Corbyn. He said: &quot;Probably not. There are trends there that suggest we&#x27;re not getting through and the result in Copeland certainly suggested that, so it will be difficult to turn that around. But we shouldn&#x27;t underestimate the extent to which the government can get into difficulties over the European Union exit negotiations. It&#x27;s not going to be anything approaching plain sailing for them.&quot;

<doc id="524003" wikidata="Q1156900" url="?curid=524003" title="Internal and external angles">
<text>In geometry, an angle of a polygon is formed by two adjacent sides. For a simple polygon (non-self-intersecting), regardless of whether it is convex or non-convex, this angle is called an internal angle (or interior angle) if a point within the angle is in the interior of the polygon. A polygon has exactly one internal angle per vertex.

If every internal angle of a simple polygon is less than a straight angle ( radians or 180°), then the polygon is called convex.

In contrast, an external angle (also called a turning angle or exterior angle) is an angle formed by one side of a simple polygon and a line extended from an adjacent side.

==Properties==
* The sum of the internal angle and the external angle on the same vertex is radians (180°).
* The sum of all the internal angles of a simple polygon is radians or degrees, where is the number of sides. The formula can be proved by using mathematical induction: starting with a triangle, for which the angle sum is 180°, then replacing one side with two sides connected at another vertex, and so on.
* The sum of the external angles of any simple polygon, if only one of the two external angles is assumed at each vertex, is radians (360°).
* The measure of the exterior angle at a vertex is unaffected by which side is extended: the two exterior angles that can be formed at a vertex by extending alternately one side or the other are vertical angles and thus are equal.

==Extension to crossed polygons==
The interior angle concept can be extended in a consistent way to crossed polygons such as star polygons by using the concept of directed angles. In general, the interior angle sum in degrees of any closed polygon, including crossed (self-intersecting) ones, is then given by , where is the number of vertices, and the strictly positive integer is the number of total (360°) revolutions one undergoes by walking around the perimeter of the polygon. In other words, the sum of all the exterior angles is radians or degrees. Example: for ordinary convex polygons and concave polygons, , since the exterior angle sum is 360°, and one undergoes only one full revolution by walking around the perimeter.

==Extension to polyhedra==
Consider a polyhedron that is topologically equivalent to a sphere, such as any convex polyhedron. Any vertex of the polyhedron will have several facets that meet at that vertex. Each of these facets will have an interior angle at that vertex and the sum of the interior angles at a vertex can be said to be the interior angle associated with that vertex of the polyhedron. The value of radians (or 360 degrees) minus that interior angle can be said to be the exterior angle associated with that vertex. The sum of these exterior angles across all vertices of the polyhedron will necessarily be radians (or 720 degrees). A proof of this can be obtained by using the formulas for the sum of interior angles of each facet together with the fact that the Euler characteristic of a sphere is 2.

For example, a rectangular solid will have three rectangular facets meeting at any vertex, with each of these facets having a 90° internal angle at that vertex, so each vertex of the rectangular solid is associated with an interior angle of and an exterior angle of . The sum of these exterior angles over all eight vertices is .

<doc id="524013" wikidata="Q1034291" url="?curid=524013" title="Cape Breton Regional Municipality">
<text>Cape Breton Regional Municipality (often referred to as simply &quot;CBRM&quot;) is the Canadian province of Nova Scotia&#x27;s second largest municipality and the economic heart of Cape Breton Island. As of 2021 the municipality has a population of 93,694. The municipality was created in 1995 through the amalgamation of eight municipalities located in Cape Breton County.

The region is home to a significant concentration of government services, social enterprise, and private sector companies, including the Canadian Coast Guard College, Cape Breton University, NSCC Marconi campus, and New Dawn Enterprises. The rural areas of the municipality continue to host resource industries such as agriculture, fishing, mining, and forestry. CBRM is host to many cultural landmarks and institutions such as the historic Savoy Theatre, the Celtic Colours International Festival, the Cape Breton Centre for Craft, the Highland Arts Theatre, and Holy Angels Arts &amp; Cultural centre, currently undergoing a $12-million renovation.

The area hosts one of Nova Scotia&#x27;s premier tourism destinations, the Fortress of Louisbourg national park site, operated by Parks Canada as a living history museum. The site stands as the largest reconstruction project in North America. The Port of Sydney was projected to welcome a record 135,000 cruise ship visitors in 2017, a 67 percent increase on 2016. The Trans-Canada Highway terminates in North Sydney where Marine Atlantic ferries connect to both Channel-Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador, where the highway starts again, and Argentia.

==History==
===Early history===

The glaciers began their retreat from the Maritimes approximately 13,500 years ago, with final deglaciation, post-glacial rebound, and sea level fluctuation ending and leaving the New England-Maritimes region virtually ice free 11,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of Paleo-Indian settlement in the region follows rapidly after deglaciation. Evidence of settlement found in the Debert Palaeo-Indian Site dates to 10,600 before the present. However, settlement seems likely to have occurred earlier, following large game animals such as the caribou as they expanded into the land revealed by the retreating glaciers. The record of continuous habitation through the paleo and archaic period over ten thousand years culminated in the development of the culture, traditions, and language of the First Nations people now known as the Mi&#x27;kmaq.

===Mi&#x27;kmaq===
The Palaeoindians inhabiting the area before European arrival lived a semi-nomad lifestyle, following the cycle of the seasons in search of food and resources, which required frequent moving from place to place. The area known as Cape Breton Island has been a part of the territory of the Mi&#x27;kmaq nation of Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki. Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki included what is now the Maritimes, parts of Maine, Newfoundland and the Gaspé Peninsula.

===French settlement===

The French were the first Europeans to claim the region, which was named Acadia. Control passed back and forth between the English and French throughout the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Under the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713, France retained control of &quot;Île Royale&quot;. In 1719, France began construction on a fortified town located along the sheltered southwestern shore of Havre Louisbourg, naming the settlement Louisbourg.

The fortress was captured by British colonial forces, then returned by the British to France. It was captured again during the Seven Years&#x27; War which saw the inhabitants expelled and the fortress completely destroyed by British Army engineers in 1760.

===Post-Acadian settlement===
By proclamation of October 17, 1763, after termination of the Seven Years&#x27; War, Île Royale was renamed Cape Breton Island and was formally annexed to Nova Scotia. For a time thereafter Cape Breton Island was part of Halifax County. On December 10, 1765, Cape Breton Island was set apart as a separate county. In 1784, the island was made a separate colony with its capital at Sydney however by 1820 the colony was remerged into Nova Scotia.

===Industrial activity===
Coal mining began during the 18th century to supply Fortress Louisbourg. Industrial mining began in 1826 under the General Mining Association monopoly, followed in later years by independent American-owned mines south of Sydney Harbour. Large-scale mining commenced in 1893 under the auspices of the Dominion Coal Company (DOMCO) which merged these independent mines. Coal production under Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO) peaked in the early 1940s and in 1957 the company became a subsidiary of Hawker Siddeley Group. The company announced in 1965 that it would be exiting the coal mining business within months.

In response to a public outcry, the minority government of Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson announced J.R. Donald would head a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Cape Breton coal industry, with hearings held in 1965 and 1966. The Donald Commission recommended that a federal Crown corporation be established to acquire and manage DOSCO&#x27;s coal operations, with the aim being to slowly wean the area economy from its dependence on the coal industry.

On July 7, 1967, the Cape Breton Development Corporation (DEVCO), was established to operate the mines in the interim, while phasing them out throughout the 1970s and, at the same time, develop new economic opportunities for the surrounding communities. At the same time, the provincial government expropriated DOSCO&#x27;s steel mill in Sydney, creating the Sydney Steel Corporation (SYSCO), while DEVCO would continue to operate the adjacent coke ovens. By 1992 the Lingan Colliery was closed followed by the Phalen Colliery in 1999 and the Prince Colliery in 2001. At the same time, the provincial government decided to dismantle and sell SYSCO.

DEVCO ceased to exist on December 31, 2009, with its remaining assets and staff turned over to Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation (ECBC), a federal government economic development initiative, in an attempt to diversify the CBRM economy. On June 19, 2014, the operations of ECBC were transferred to both the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and the Public Works and Government Services Canada.

===Amalgamation===

In 1992, the Task Force on Local Government Report (often called the Hayward report) stated that 67 municipalities in Nova Scotia were too many to provide services efficiently and cost-effectively in a province with a population of slightly more than 900,000. The report was commissioned for the Progressive Conservative government of Donald Cameron but was taken up and implemented by the incoming Liberal government of John Savage.

The provincial government subsequently forced the amalgamation of both Halifax and Cape Breton Counties and supported the voluntary amalgamation of Queens County. The &quot;Cape Breton Regional Municipality Act&quot; was implemented and the CBRM was created on August 1, 1995, whereas the amalgamation in Halifax County took place only on April 1, 1996, with that of Queens County several years later.

The municipalities from which the CBRM was created included the Municipality of the County of Cape Breton, the City of Sydney, the Towns of Glace Bay, Sydney Mines, New Waterford, North Sydney, Dominion and Louisbourg.

==Government==


The Cape Breton Regional Municipality is governed by Cape Breton Regional Council, which is composed of a mayor elected at-large and 12 councillors each elected to represent a separate district. Regional Council is responsible for all facets of the municipal government, including police, fire, library, transit, and water. The municipality oversaw an operating budget of $146 million and a combined capital and water capital budget of $32.375 million in the 2016/17 fiscal year. The current mayor is Amanda McDougall. Council and its committees meet at least once a month.

Municipal governments in Nova Scotia are elected every four years and the most recent round of elections took place on October 17, 2020. The provincial legislation that creates and empowers the municipality is the Nova Scotia Municipal Government Act. Under former Mayor John Morgan, the council authorized several studies regarding fairness and equity, fighting for a larger share of the federal equalization funding from the province, including an ultimately unsuccessful legal challenge in 2004. Nova Scotians for Equalization Fairness is a citizens group that continues to argue for a greater share of equalization payments paid to CBRM, arguing that CBRM receives $15 million in equalization and should receive $239 million, based on per capita distribution of federal equalization to the province.

In addition to municipal government there are two First Nations in CBRM operating under band government, the Eskasoni First Nation and the Membertou First Nation. CBRM is represented by seven ridings in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. The municipality shares representation by two ridings in Canada&#x27;s House of Commons, as well as by Senator Michael L. MacDonald, who identifies as representing the Senate Division of Cape Breton.

==Economy==

After a long struggle to recover from the disappearance of coal and steel industries and while continuing to suffer from high annual population loss the economy of Cape Breton is projected to achieve sustainable growth from 2017 to 2021. Cape Breton Island, of which CBRM is home to over three quarters of the population, has continued economic strength in its fishing and forestry primary sectors and in services (trade, transportation and warehousing, business and other support services), education, health care, and accommodation &amp; food. While the region boasts a diverse industrial economy when compared to other regions in Nova Scotia, the region continues to struggle with an unemployment rate of 13.7% in December 2017, significantly higher than the Nova Scotia and national averages.

CBRM is home to a significant tourism industry. Nearby attractions such as the Cape Breton Highlands, Bras d&#x27;Or Lake and Fortress of Louisbourg have made Cape Breton Island a tourism destination for many years. Visitors can experience the art and history that Sydney and area has to offer, or experience Sydney&#x27;s surging culinary scene. A growing cruise ship business has been making use of the port of Sydney to give cruise passengers access to the area. The Port of Sydney hosts more than 70 cruise ships per season, most notably the &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;, &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;, and MS &quot;Maasdam&quot;. A recent study found that a strong tourism cluster is emerging and will be reinforced with the recent announcement of a second cruise ship dock in Sydney.

Currently, the former Sydney Steel Corporation&#x27;s site in Sydney has been transformed into the Harbourside Commercial Park focused on office and light industrial use, connected in 2010 by the Sydney Port Access Road to Highway 125. As the province&#x27;s second largest municipality, recent federal policy of increased infrastructure spending will provide added economic stimulus.

==Geography==

The boundary of CBRM includes all of Cape Breton County except for the Eskasoni and Membertou First Nations.

===Climate===
The climate of the CBRM is cool and wet although it is warmer than most other places in Canada. The average annual temperature is close to . The average summer maximum temperature is .

Temperatures rarely rise above . The average winter low is and temperatures rarely drop below although strong winter winds can make it seem much colder.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Cape Breton Regional Municipality had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021. 

Within the regional municipality there are multiple census population centres (previously known as urban areas). These include Cape Breton-Sydney (population: 30,960), Glace Bay (population: 16,915), Sydney Mines (population: 12,353), New Waterford (population: 6,723), and Howie Centre (population: 1,106). 

=== Ethnicity ===


=== Language ===
Mother tongue language (2021)

The most reported mother tongues aside from English or French were Punjabi (0.7%), Chinese Languages (0.5%), and Malayalam (0.4%).

=== Religion ===
75.6% of Cape Breton residents identify as Christian in 2021, down from 90.5% in 2011. About 21.9% affiliate with no religion, up from 8.5% in 2011. The remaining 2.6% affiliate with another religion, up from 0.9% in 2011. The largest non-Christian religion was Hinduism with 0.7% of the population. In 2011 there were zero recorded Sikh residents, however by 2021 they accounted for 0.6% of the population making Sikhs the second largest non-Christian group.

==Transportation==

The Port of Sydney Development Corporation was established in 2015. Owned by the municipality, the port corporation manages and operates the port, including the emerging cruise ship business, the Joan Harriss Cruise Pavilion and Marina. International investors have announced construction of the Novaporte, the deep-water marine container facility able to accommodate ultra-class container ships at the port. Novaporte is proposed to operate as an officially designated Canadian Foreign Trade Zone. The Port of Sydney was projected to welcome a record 135,000 cruise ship visitors in 2017, a 67% increase on 2016.

J.A. Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport serves CBRM and Cape Breton Island, providing domestic flight connections via Air Canada and WestJet as well as charter flight service. The airport is classified as an airport of entry, staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency. The region is served by Maritime Bus, a coach bus service connecting North Sydney and Sydney to the mainland via Whycocomagh and Wagmatcook. The Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway provided rail service connecting Cape Breton to the mainland and CN Rail in Truro. Service ended December 30, 2014 though negotiations between the province and the owner to revive the railway are ongoing. Sydney Coal Railway is a short line railway connecting the coaling piers on Sydney Harbour in Sydney to the Lingan Generating Station near New Waterford.
The municipality is the western terminus of the Marine Atlantic ferry services to Newfoundland. It is also the eastern terminus of two east–west highways in the province: Highway 105, the Trans-Canada Highway, runs along the north shore of Bras d&#x27;Or Lake and accesses the northern part of CBRM, whereas Trunk 4 extends along the southern part of Bras d&#x27;Or Lake and accesses the western and eastern part of the municipality. Within the municipality communities are served by Highway 125, a regional 4-lane arterial limited access highway that circles Sydney Harbour.
Public transit service is delivered by Transit Cape Breton, which offers thirteen bus routes within the municipality, serving the region&#x27;s larger communities: Sydney, Sydney River, Glace Bay, New Waterford, Dominion, Reserve Mines, North Sydney and Sydney Mines. Handi-Trans paratransit is available for passengers whose disabilities restrict them from using Transit Cape Breton&#x27;s regular bus service. Fares range from $1.25 to $5, depending on how many zones are travelled.

==Education==

The regional municipality is home to several institutions of higher learning:
* Cape Breton University 
* NSCC Marconi Campus

English language public schools in CBRM are operated by the Cape Breton – Victoria Regional Centre for Education on behalf of the provincial government&#x27;s Department of Education. This regional education office provides instruction for grades primary to 12 in CBRM as well as in neighbouring Victoria County.

French language public school education is administered throughout the province by the Conseil Scolaire Acadien Provincial.

==Culture==
While Cape Breton Island is known for its Scottish Gaelic or Celtic culture and heritage, the industrial strength of Sydney and industrial Cape Breton attracted a diverse community from around the world. CBRM&#x27;s cultural scene continues to be influenced by a mixture of these other cultures including African Canadian, Jewish, Irish, and a variety of Eastern European countries.
The region is home to several festivals of art and music such as the Celtic Colours International Festival, Lumiere Art at Night, the Cape Breton International Drum Festival, Makin&#x27; Waves, and Gobblefest Music Festival. The area is also known for its vibrant music scene, which includes celtic, singer-songwriter, and country artists, as well as underground alternative rock, metal, and punk bands who have played the local circuit since the mid to late 1990s. Among the musicians from CBRM was Canadian country singer Rita MacNeil from the CBRM community of Big Pond, and known for her songs including &quot;Flying On Your Own&quot; and &quot;Working Man.&quot; Other notable artists include Tom Fun Orchestra, Slowcoaster, Pretty Archie, Matt Minglewood, Jordan Musycsyn, Carmen Townsend, Morgan Toney, Alicia Penney, and Fire Valley Fire.
CBRM is home to several performance centres, including the Centre 200 sports arena in Sydney, home to the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles (a Quebec Major Junior Hockey League team), the Highland Arts Theatre performing arts centre, also in Sydney, and the historic Savoy Theatre, in Glace Bay. The Holy Angels Arts &amp; Cultural centre is currently undergoing a $12 million renovation. Glace Bay is also home to the Cape Breton Miners&#x27; Museum, the Marconi National Historic Site and the Glace Bay Heritage Museum. Louisbourg is home to Fortress of Louisbourg, the largest historical reconstruction in North America.

CBRM is home to several media outlets. CBC Radio broadcasts local morning and afternoon broadcasts across Cape Breton Island. Caper Radio, a campus and community radio station, broadcasts local music and college radio from the Student&#x27;s Union Building in Cape Breton University. There are also five commercial radio stations. Cape Breton&#x27;s daily newspaper the &quot;Cape Breton Post&quot; is a broadsheet focusing on Cape Breton Island. Its editorial style is populist conservative, and it is owned by The Chronicle Herald&quot;.

==Protective services==
===Police===
The Cape Breton Regional Police Service provides policing for all areas of CBRM with the exception of the First Nation community of Eskasoni which is policed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The CBRPS operates out of three geographic divisions, Central (Sydney), East (Glace Bay) and North (North Sydney). The CBRPS works towards providing efficient law enforcement and working within the community and has recently cracked down on drug related crime in CBRM. The current Chief of Police is Robert Walsh.

Policing in Cape Breton County prior to amalgamation was delivered by individual police forces in the urban areas and RCMP in the rural county. In the late 1990s, after a divisive debate, the municipality expanded CBRPS coverage to also cover the rural area of CBRM.

===Fire &amp; Emergency ===
Fire &amp; emergency services for the CBRM are provided by the Cape Breton Regional Fire Service which consists of 36 fire stations dispersed throughout the municipality; two Sydney stations are staffed by career firefighters whereas the remaining 34 stations are staffed by volunteers. CBRFE has divisions for administration, fire departments, training, fire prevention, volunteer coordination, hazardous materials, building services and bylaws.
In addition, paramedic ambulance service in Nova Scotia is provided by the provincial government&#x27;s Emergency Health Services.

===Emergency Measures Organization===
The provincial Emergency Measures Act requires each municipality to develop an emergency measures organization. The municipality has an Emergency Measures Coordinator supported by an EMO Advisory Committee and an Emergency Preparedness Planning Committee.

==Sister cities==
* Dalian, Liaoning, China (2015). The sister city arrangement, the first ever for a Cape Breton community, follows an announcement that China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) has agreed, contingent on a feasibility study, to design and build a deep water container terminal in Sydney.
* Wałbrzych, Poland: On June 26, 2018, the Council of the Cape Breton Regional Municipality passed a resolution to recognize Wałbrzych as a partner city. This followed a resolution in Wałbrzych on June 21, 2018. The CBRM resolution cited commonalities in post-industrial heritage, and potential future collaboration among historic sites, schools, universities and businesses. Also noted was the Cape Breton Regional Municipality&#x27;s longstanding Polish community. An agreement was formally signed by both mayors on January 11, 2019, during a video-conference session in the presence of students and representatives of organizations, schools, and universities.

<text>CHFD-DT (channel 4) is a television station in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, affiliated with the Global Television Network. It is owned by locally based Dougall Media alongside CTV affiliate CKPR-DT (channel 2). Both stations share studios on Hill and Van Norman Streets in central Thunder Bay, while CHFD-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located in Shuniah, Ontario.

Since February 12, 2010, CHFD carries the vast majority of Global&#x27;s programming schedule and brands itself on-air as Global Thunder Bay in the manner of the network&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations.

==History==

===As a CTV affiliate===
CHFD went on the air for the first time on October 14, 1972, as a CTV affiliate. The station is part of the Thunder Bay Television twinstick with the then-CBC affiliate CKPR. From 2002 to 2009, it was among three CTV-affiliated stations in Canada not owned and operated directly by CTV.

As a CTV affiliate, CHFD also aired selected programming purchased from Global, such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, as well as religious programming commonly aired on Global stations, including &quot;100 Huntley Street&quot; and the &quot;Hour of Power&quot;. It has also aired programs which do not air on other broadcast channels in Canada, such as Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;.

===Affiliation with the Global Television Network===

In January 2010, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) published an application filed by CHFD to disaffiliate from CTV as of February 28, after not being able to negotiate an acceptable new programming agreement with the network, indicating it had instead reached an expanded program supply agreement with Global. However, on February 12, just before CTV&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics began, and before the CRTC was able to rule on the application, CHFD began carrying Global programming full-time. It had attempted to get broadcast rights for the Olympics – which the station said was a separate matter from the network affiliation – but was again unable to reach an acceptable agreement. After affiliating with Global, CHFD rebranded from Thunder Bay Television to Global Thunder Bay, and adopted a new logo and website similar to Global&#x27;s owned and operated stations (this differs from most Canadian television stations that are not under common ownership with a television system or national television network; such stations typically use their callsigns as their on-air branding).

Local cable company Shaw Cable advised customers who wish to continue to watch CTV programming to subscribe to their digital cable timeshifting package; the company did, however, add CTV Toronto to its basic lineup on channel 23 for the duration of the Olympics.

In June 2014, Dougall Media announced that sister station CKPR would switch its affiliation from CBC to CTV in September. The affiliation switch took effect on September 1, 2014.

On January 27, 2016, Dougall Media officials revealed that CKPR and CHFD are both being sustained by the payouts from life insurance policies on former owner Fraser Dougall and a former general manager who both died in 2015, and said that the stations were likely to shut down by September 1, barring a favourable change in CRTC policies on local television funding. Both stations, however, are still in operation.

==Programming==
Currently the station clears the majority of Global programming, with some preemptions in the daytime schedule for a local morning newscast at 9 a.m. and infomercials as well as the weekend edition of &quot;Global National&quot; since fall 2011.

Locally produced programs include &quot;Officially Rugged&quot;, &quot;TB Classifieds&quot;, and the nightly &quot;Headline News&quot; (no relation to the CNN-owned channel). CHFD also airs a Saturday evening newscast and repeats CKPR&#x27;s 11 p.m. &quot;TB News Late Edition&quot; at 11:30 on weeknights, along with a simulcast of Global Toronto&#x27;s &quot;Global News Morning&quot; on weekday mornings from 6–9 a.m., and also &quot;News at Noon&quot; on weekday noon at 12–12:30 p.m.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
CHFD-DT flash cut to digital in early August 2011 alongside sister station CKPR.

Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display CHFD-DT&#x27;s virtual channel as 4.1.

In January 2011, Dougall Media applied with the CRTC to broadcast its digital signal instead on channel 4.

=== Rebroadcasters ===
CHFD-TV had operated an analog rebroadcaster in Armstrong (CKAR-TV, channel 8). It is believed that the Armstrong transmitter had been shut down as there are little or no sources and references from the CRTC, historical information and technical databases regarding this rebroadcast transmitter. On February 18, 1993, Armstrong Resources Development Corporation submitted an application to the CRTC to operate a television rebroadcast transmitter at Armstrong on channel 7 with a power of 10 watts, to retransmit the signal of CHFD-TV in Thunder Bay.

<doc id="524020" wikidata="Q1720063" url="?curid=524020" title="Kaokoland">
<text>Kaokoland was an administrative unit and a Bantustan in northern South West Africa (now Namibia). Established in 1980 during the apartheid era, it was intended to be a self-governing homeland of the Ovahimba, but an actual government was never established, and the territory was administered by the leaders of Hereroland. Like other homelands in South West Africa, the Kaokoland Bantustan was abolished in May 1989, at the beginning of the transition of Namibia towards independence.

&quot;Kaokoland&quot; remains as an informal name for the geographic area, while the political unit of administration since 1990 has been Kunene Region. The area is in the Kaokoveld ecoregion. The area is one of the wildest and least populated areas in Namibia, with a population density of one person every 2 km2 (1/4 of the national average). The most represented ethnic group is the Himba people, who account for about 5,000 of the overall 16,000 inhabitants of Kaokoland. The main settlement in Kaokoland was the city of Opuwo.

==Geography==

The Kaokoland area extends south-north from the Hoanib river to the Kunene river (that also marks the border between Namibia and Angola). It is largely mountainous, with the northern Baynes Mountains reaching their maximum elevation at 2039 m. Other notable mountain ranges of Kaokoland include the Otjihipa Mountains (to the north) and the Hartmann Mountains (to the east). The land is generally dry and rocky, especially to the south, where it borders on the Namib Desert; nevertheless, it has several rivers as well as falls. The most notable falls in Kaokoland are the Ruacana Falls (120 m high, 700 m wide) and the Epupa Falls, both formed by the Kunene river. The northern part of Kaokoland is greener, with vegetation thriving valleys such as the Marienfluss and Hartmann Valley.

==History==

Before colonialism, Kaokoland was mostly inhabited by the Ovambo, Nama, and Herero people. In the second half of the 19th century, a group of Herero crossed the Kunene River, migrating north to what is now Angola, joining with the Bushmen in Southern Angola; the modern day Himba people originated from this Angolan Herero group. In 1884, Kaokoland became part of German South West Africa, and the Namibian Herero people changed much of their habits and costumes as a consequence of German rule. After World War I, South Africa received the mandate from the League of Nations to administer the territory of Namibia, which became, for all practical purposes, a province of South Africa. South Africa also applied to Namibia the principles of apartheid, including the creation of distinct Bantustans (homelands) for different African ethnic groups. Kaokoland was thus established as a Bantustan for the Himba people, who in the 1920s had come back from Angola into Namibia. Despite its scarce population, Kaokoland was greatly affected by the struggle for independence of Namibia, and most specifically by the so-called &quot;bush war&quot; that was fought across the border with Angola (i.e., in Kaokoland).

==The Himba people==
The Himba people are the descendants of a Herero group that got isolated from the others in the 19th century. While the Herero people later experienced German rule and drastically changed their lifestyle as well as their costumes, the Himba retained much of their traditional, nomadic and pastoral habits. In recent times, contacts between Himbas and Western tourists are becoming more and more common, especially in the most easily accessible regions of Kaokoland (e.g., the surroundings of Opuwo). While this has partially affected the Himba culture, Himbas have essentially remained faithful to their tradition.

==Fauna==
Fauna in Kaokoland suffered from a severe crippling between 1977 and 1982, as well as from poaching throughout the 1970s, but has been recovering afterwards. It includes several desert-dwelling species, most notably a population of desert elephants that are sometimes classified as a distinct subspecies of African elephants because of their shorter legs and specific, desert-adapted behaviour (the only other place in Africa where elephants have adapted to a desert environment being Mali, on the border of the Sahara desert). Its longer legs, bigger feet, and incredible ability to withstand periods of drought all gave valid reasons to think so. Today, however, it is not considered a different species, rather regarded as only &#x27;desert adapted.&#x27; The herds in this area remain separate from other elephant herds in Namibia and only appear to have longer legs and bigger feet, because they eat less than elephants living in more food abundant areas such as Etosha National Park, the Caprivi, and the Chobe region in Botswana.

The desert elephant populate a three-thousand square kilometre range and regularly travel up to two hundred kilometres in search of water. They only drink every three or four days, compared to elephants in Etosha drinking 100 to 200 L of water a day. They also seem to be more environmentally conscious than other elephants: unlike other elephants, the desert-adapted elephant rarely knock over trees, break branches, or tear away bark.

They are commonly roaming the dry riverbeds of the westward flowing Huab, Hoanib, Hoarusib, and Khumib rivers. It is along these riverbeds that the animals find the occasional spring fed waterhole and most of their nutrient rich foods: mopane bark, tamarisk, reeds, and the pods, bark, and leaves of the ana tree. On a typical day, desert elephants travel up to sixty kilometres over rocky, difficult terrain between feeding areas and waterholes. When water is truly scarce, as in times of drought, they dig holes, commonly known as gorras, in the dry riverbeds. Water seeps up from below the surface creating a much needed water source for themselves, and for other animals in the area; unlike other elephants, which drink daily, desert elephants have been known to survive without water for up to four days.

Black rhinos were extinguished in the area in 1983, but they have been reintroduced. Other species found in Kaokoland include oryxes, kudus, springboks, ostriches, giraffes and mountain zebras.

==Tourism and transportation==

After the end of the bush war, Kaokoland has become a common tourist destination in Namibia, due to its proximity to the Etosha National Park (to the south), the unspoiled nature (with several spots suitable for activities such as rafting and trekking), and the opportunity to visit traditional Himba villages. Notable landmarks in the area include the Epupa Falls, Sesfontein, Himba villages, and the Ondurusa Rapids.

Kaokoland is one of the wildest regions of Southern Africa, with very few roads and structures. The only road that is accessible to non-4WD vehicles is the one connecting Sesfontein and Opuwo. Many roads in Kaokoland are often in very bad condition and may even be challenging for 4WDs, especially during the rainy season. Most services such as shops, a hospital and a fuel station, are only found in Opuwo.

<text>Jean Bon Saint-André (; 25 February 174910 December 1813) was a French politician of the Revolutionary era.

==Early career and role in the National Convention==
He was born in Montauban (Tarn-et-Garonne), the son of a fuller. Although his parents were Protestants, Saint-André was raised by the Jesuits at Marseille, and got baptized, as required by law. As a young boy, Saint-André had ambition to study the law, but his dream was crushed when the King prohibited Protestants and their children from getting involved in much of the public life, including getting the bar. When Saint-André was about sixteen years old, he enrolled in the merchant marine, and became lieutenant several years later and shortly after, captain. In 1771, after three shipwrecks and the loss of all his savings, he abandoned this career. Saint-André later turned Protestant, and became a prominent pastor in Southern France at Castres in 1773, and afterwards in Montauban in 1788. Saint-André studied theology in Geneva for three years, and married Marie de Suc in 1780. Right before the outbreak of the French Revolution, tension between Protestants and Catholics caused Saint-André to flee. During this time, he drafted an article entitled, &quot;Considérations sur l&#x27;organisation civile des Eglises protestantes&quot; (Thoughts on the civil organisation of Protestants), which advocated for protecting Protestants&#x27; religious rights within France. Saint-André later returned around December, 1790. He then found The Society of the Friends of the Constitution, and started his political career. On 2 November 1792 Saint-André was elected president of the Jacobins.

As a member of The Society of the Friends of the Constitution, Saint-André sat on The Mountain, led by Maximilien Robespierre. When Louis XVI of France was found guilty of plotting against the Convention and France, he, along with many members of the Convention, voted for the King&#x27;s execution. In September 1792, he opposed the punishment of the authors of the September Massacres. In January 1793, Saint-André expressed his ideas in a speech called &quot;Sur l&#x27;Education nationale,&quot; which demanded a variety of changes to the old Catholic-controlled education system. Later that same year in June, when the Jacobins gained control of the Assembly Saint-André became a member of the Committee of Public Safety, and it was he who proposed Maximilien Robespierre for membership shortly afterwards. In July 1793, Saint-André was elected President of the National Convention, and in his capacity, he announced the death of Marat. That same month, Saint-André was sent on a mission to the Armies of the East fighting in the Revolutionary Wars.

While working with the Committee of Public Safety, Jeanbon Saint-André played a pivotal role in the restoration of the naval fleet. He was a former Huguenot pastor and merchant sea captain who was considered the Montagnards’ expert on naval affairs. The Convention granted Saint-André an unlimited amount of power in order to preserve the fleet for the Republic, and to crush all forms of counter-revolutionary opposition.

==Reign of Terror==
On the Committee of Public Safety, his main responsibility was the navy, which he took over from Bertrand Barère. During Saint-André&#x27;s time in the Navy, he played a crucial role in dealing with France&#x27;s foreign affairs, especially toward England, confronting the English government for trying to convince the Jews to terminate trading with France. On September 20, 1793, Saint-André obtained a vote of one hundred million francs for constructing vessels; from September 1793 to January 1794, he reorganized the military harbours of Brest and Cherbourg, in the northwestern coast of France. Saint-André noticed striking parallels between the situation in Brest and in the Committee&#x27;s occupation of Toulon after its siege in late 1793. Toulon became the stigma of dishonor and treason due to its defection in 1793. The city of Toulon, in revolt against the National Convention, was under British control. The revolt during this time period was a product of British influence over Toulon, as well as royalist ideologies being upheld by those in positions of power in Toulon. The parallels between Toulon and Brest with respect to British influence and revolt against the Republic was striking.

In 1793, the Federalist Revolt against the National Assembly in the port city of Brest was partly linked to Jeanbon Saint-André as its citizens viewed the Navy divided between the two major clubs, the Montagnards and the Girondins. He reported that the destruction of the French fleet was a form of conspiracy against the Republic. His theory was clear: the parallels he was observing between the situations at Brest and Toulon were based on the conspiracy of ex-nobles and officers against the Republic, as well as the presence of British influence in both cities. Both problems contributed to the seemingly impossible task set before Saint-André - achieving unity within the French Navy. In response to the Quibéron mutinies, Jeanbon removed Captains Kerguelen, Thomas, Bonnefous, and Larichery from their positions. Saint-André also arrested six more officers, and sent them off to Paris for trial. He later established a Revolutionary Tribunal, which trialled and sentenced the death of ten naval officers. This caused anti-revolutionists, including Oscar Havard, to believe Jeanbon conspired to hand Brest to Britain; Jeanbon&#x27;s true motives was to bring the downfall of the Navy in response to the dominance of Catholicism in French society.

Under Saint-André&#x27;s command, the Naval regime was reformed in such a way that the &quot;lowest seaman could aspire to the rank of admiral&quot;. He also expressed Jacobin ideas through a policy he created in which all Navy workers received equal benefits and treatments. The Western regions of France became problematic to the Revolution. The physical location of Brittany, a peninsula with poorly paved roads, and specifically Brest, made transport of provisions and travel difficult and time-consuming. Aside from the physical aspects of Brittany&#x27;s separation from the rest of the Nation, the gabelle (the salt tax) played a significant role in isolating the Province. This was a zone of the &quot;redimes,&quot; also known as a tax-free zone. Both of these aspects contributed to the separation of Brittany from the rest of the country. Brittany was, however, still of strategic significance to the Committee of Public Safety. The Committee believed that utilizing the city as a seaport for the French fleet would allow them to galvanize a fleet of ships to sail to the nearby southern peninsula of England in order to begin an offensive effort.

Saint-André sought to regain control of Brittany by eliminating the easy-going and inattentive eyes of the old regime, emphasizing how &quot;the negligence of a sleepy tyrant or of somnolent ministers does not agree with our [republican] principles.&quot; On 20 November 1793, Saint-André and Jean-Jacques Bréard, another agent of the Committee, issued a decree with a regular naval penal code, a code which was later sanctioned by the Convention and applied to the entire navy.

==Downfall of Jacobin and later missions==

On 31 January 1794, on his return from Brest, Saint-André presented a report to the Convention on the state of the navy. Saint-André did away with the hierarchical system of the old regime&#x27;s navy, stripping officers of their traditional luxuries, such as food privileges, and emphasizing the need for officers to set an obedient example. An education system was also implemented, utilizing Jacobin propaganda and schoolmasters who taught the sailors to read and write so they could aspire to promotion. Saint-André also eliminated holidays, industrializing the coastal city into a system split into day and night shifts enforced by strict military rule. Royalist officers were imprisoned, discipline restored, and a new regime of training introduced across the navy. The officer corps and civilian administration of the navy were brought up to strength. Lighthouses were built at Penmarch and Groix, and new ships of the line were built. These changes sought to turn Brest into an absolute collectivist city, where all was at service to the Republic. Thanks to this reforming zeal, France was able to build and launch new frigates at three times the rate of the Royal Navy during the same period. By 1794, under Saint-André&#x27;s watch, fifty ships of the line had been placed into service under the control of the newly appointed fleet commander Villaret de Joyeuse.

Contributing to this success was the presence of Jacques-Noël Sané, a renowned ship engineer who had built Joyeuse&#x27;s 118-gun flagship &quot;Montagne&quot;. Though the reformation of the navy has not had as much historical acclaim as the work other Committee members performed on the army, with many critics pointing to its losses in the battle of the Glorious First of June in 1794, the reforms that took place were nonetheless vital in ensuring France&#x27;s continued success in war.

On 15 February 1794 Saint-André made the red, white, and blue vertical stripes flag the national flag of France. Saint-André later participated in a mission in the south, which lasted from July 1794 to March 1795, and in which he showed moderation in contrast to the directives of the Reign of Terror. Shortly after, he was arrested on May 28, 1795 and imprisoned at the College of Four Nations, but was released by the amnesty of the year IV. During this time, Saint-André wrote about his experiences in the Turkish cells entitled, &quot;Tale of my captivity on the banks of the Black Sea.&quot; On 28 July 1794, the Jacobin faction lost support of the crowd and most of its members, most notably Robespierre, were guillotined; the crowd saw that Saint-André had mostly spent his time on mission and had not participated in the decisions made during the Jacobins&#x27; control, so he was granted his life. However, with the Jacobin bourgeoisie, he had justified the impediment of the representations of the people, which are the sectional societies: &quot;Our greatest enemies are not outside; we see them: they are in our midst; they want to take revolutionary measures further than we do. &quot;

He was then appointed consul at Algiers and Smyrna (1798) and was kept prisoner by the Ottoman Empire for three years (during the Napoleonic Wars). Released in 1801, Saint-André subsequently became préfet of the department of Mont-Tonnerre (1801) and commissary-general of the three departments on the left bank of the Rhine. Napoleon made him a member of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1804 and a Baron of the Empire in 1809. He died of typhoid in Mainz.

<text>The Pacific Time Zone (PT) is a time zone encompassing parts of western Canada, the western United States, and western Mexico. Places in this zone observe standard time by subtracting eight hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC−08:00). During daylight saving time, a time offset of UTC−07:00 is used.

In the United States and Canada, this time zone is generically called the Pacific Time Zone. Specifically, time in this zone is referred to as Pacific Standard Time (PST) when standard time is being observed (early November to mid-March), and Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) when daylight saving time (mid-March to early November) is being observed. In Mexico, the corresponding time zone is known as the &quot;Zona Noroeste&quot; (Northwest Zone) and observes the same daylight saving schedule as the United States and Canada. The largest city in the Pacific Time Zone is Los Angeles, whose metropolitan area is also the largest in the time zone.

The zone is two hours ahead of the Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone, one hour ahead of the Alaska Time Zone, one hour behind the Mountain Time Zone, two hours behind the Central Time Zone, three hours behind the Eastern Time Zone, and four hours behind the Atlantic Time Zone.

==Canada==

One Canadian province is split between the Pacific Time Zone and the Mountain Time Zone:
*British Columbia – all, except for the Highway 95 corridor (including Golden and Creston) in the southeast, and Tumbler Ridge, Fort St. John, and Dawson Creek in the northeast

The border between time zones in British Columbia was decided in a 1972 plebiscite held in northeastern and southeastern electoral districts due to their ties to neighboring Alberta.

As of September 24, 2020, Yukon officially switched from the Pacific Time Zone to a time zone &quot;to be reckoned as seven hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC−7)&quot; after deciding to stop observing daylight saving time.

==Mexico==

In Mexico, the &quot;Zona Noroeste&quot;, which corresponds to Pacific Time in the United States and Canada, includes:
*Baja California

==United States==
Two states are fully contained in the Pacific Time Zone:
*California 
*Washington

Three states are split between the Pacific Time Zone and the Mountain Time Zone:
*Idaho – 10 counties in the Idaho Panhandle north of Hells Canyon and the Salmon River are in the Pacific Time Zone due to proximity to cities in Washington
*Nevada – all, except for West Wendover since 1999, due to proximity to Wendover, Utah
**Several towns along the Idaho border, including Jackpot, Jarbidge, Mountain City, and Owyhee, observe Mountain Time.
*Oregon – all, except for the majority of Malheur County due to proximity to Idaho cities; it was moved in 1923 to accommodate the needs of the Oregon Short Line Railroad.

One state is split between the Pacific Time Zone (unofficially), the Alaska Time Zone, and the Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone:
*Alaska – Hyder, which unofficially uses Pacific Time due to proximity to Stewart, British Columbia

==Daylight saving time==

Through 2006, the local time (PST, UTC−08:00) changed to daylight time (PDT, UTC−07:00) at 02:00 LST (local standard time) to 03:00 LDT (local daylight time) on the first Sunday in April, and returned at 02:00 LDT to 01:00 LST on the last Sunday in October. The United States Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which moved the local time changes from PST to PDT to the second Sunday in March and the reversal from PDT to PST to the first Sunday in November. Like other Canadian provinces that observe daylight time, British Columbia adopted the same dates in April 2006, to take effect in March 2007 alongside the U.S. Several Mexican states, including Baja California, implemented the new dates for the daylight time changes in 2010, ending a three-year period where cities across the Mexico–United States border had a one-hour difference for two months a year.

Proposals to abolish the bi-annual time change and adopt year-round standard time or daylight time gained popularity among U.S. states in the 2010s. 59 percent of voters in California approved a 2018 ballot proposition that authorizes the legislature to use year-round daylight saving time, pending Congressional approval. The Washington State Legislature passed a bill in May 2019 that would move the state to permanent daylight time, subject to Congressional approval; the Oregon Legislative Assembly passed a similar bill a month later, while California&#x27;s attempt failed. The provincial government of British Columbia announced in 2019 that they would follow the U.S. states in whether the time changes were kept or removed in order to maintain a unified time zone. In 2020, Idaho passed legislation to allow for permanent daylight time for the Pacific Time Zone. Congressional approval was sought through the Sunshine Protection Act, which was submitted several times and passed by the U.S. Senate in 2022, but its equivalent in the House of Representatives failed to pass.

<text>Kilchoan () is a village on the Scottish peninsula of Ardnamurchan, beside the Sound of Mull in Lochaber, Highland. It is the most westerly village in mainland Britain, although several tiny hamlets lie further west on the peninsula (of these, the most westerly is called Portuairk). The western linear, coastal parts of the village are Ormsaigmore and Ormsaigbeg.

Kilchoan has a population of about 150 people.

==History==
M.E.M. Donaldson equates &quot;Buarblaig&quot; (now Bourblaige about east of Kilchoan on the other side of the eastern mountain of Ben Hiant at , ) with Muribulg, where the Annals of Tigernach record a battle between the Picts and Dalriads in 731 AD.
It may also be the &#x27;Muirbole Paradisi&#x27; mentioned by Adomnán.

For many years following the 1688 overthrow and exile of the House of Stuart, the historic parish church at Kilchoan, which was dedicated to Saint Comgan and which is now in ruins, was a Non-juring Episcopal parish within the Church of Scotland. South Uist native Mhaighstir Alasdair MacDhòmhnaill, 1st of Dalilea, was the rector of Kilchoan until his death around 1724. In addition to being well known locally as a folk hero, Maighstir Alasdair MacDhòmhnaill was the father of poet Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair, who served as the Gaelic tutor to Prince Charles Edward Stuart during the Jacobite rising of 1745 and is one of the most important figures of Scottish Gaelic literature.

==Landmarks==
The ancient Mingary Castle is on the coast about 1 km east of the village.

Examples of a type of igneous rock structure called a cone sheet are found at Kilchoan.

Below the slope north-west of the village street is a chambered cairn, Greadal Fhinn.

Ben Hiant is the highest point of the peninsula at 528 m and lies between the village and the coastal hamlet of Ardslignish.

==Tourism and amenities==
===Transport===
A regular CalMac ferry service runs from Kilchoan to Tobermory on the Isle of Mull. To and from the regional centre of Fort William, one bus per day Monday to Saturday connects with the ferry via Salen and the Corran Ferry


===Kilchoan Bay===
Kilchoan Bay has four visitor moorings, a ferry jetty, a shop with a post office, showers and a petrol station.

===Hospitality===
The Kilchoan House Hotel is now the most westerly bar/hotel on the mainland of the UK, after the closure of Sonachan Hotel.

Ardnamurchan Campsite, Kilchoan.

==Geology==
The minerals kilchoanite, dellaite and rustumite were first found at Kilchoan. A natural history museum is adjacent to the hamlet to the east at the coastal hamlet of Glenmore.

==Notable residents==

<doc id="524034" wikidata="Q3238805" url="?curid=524034" title="Alaska Time Zone">
<text>The Alaska Time Zoneobserves standard time by subtracting nine hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC−09:00). During daylight saving time its time offset is eight hours (UTC−08:00). The clock time in this zone is based on mean solar time at the 135th meridian west of the Greenwich Observatory.

The zone includes nearly all of the U.S. state of Alaska and is one hour behind the Pacific Time Zone. 

*standard time: Alaska Standard Time (AKST)
*daylight saving time: Alaska Daylight Time (AKDT)

The western Aleutian Islands observe Hawaii–Aleutian Time, one hour behind the remainder of the state.

The largest city in the Alaskan Time Zone is Anchorage, Alaska. The Anchorage Metropolitan Area is the largest metropolitan area in the zone. 

Effective from 2007, the local time changes from AKST to AKDT at 02:00 AKST to 03:00 AKDT on the second Sunday in March and returns at 02:00 AKDT to 01:00 AKST on the first Sunday in November. As such, Alaska spends most of the year on daylight saving time rather than standard time.

==History==
Two time zones have been referred to as the &quot;Alaska Time Zone&quot;: a zone based on UTC−10:00 that covered much of Central Alaska in the early 20th century, and a zone based on UTC−09:00 zone that has covered all of the state except the Aleutian Islands since 1983.

The Standard Time Act of 1918 authorized the Interstate Commerce Commission to define each time zone. The United States Standard Alaska Time was designated as UTC−10:00. Some references prior to 1967 refer to this zone as Central Alaska Standard Time (CAST) or as Alaska Standard Time (AKST). In 1966, the Uniform Time Act renamed the UTC−10:00 zone to Alaska-Hawaii Standard Time (AHST), effective April 1, 1967. This zone was renamed in 1983 to Hawaii–Aleutian Standard Time when the majority of Alaska was moved out of the zone.

Prior to 1983, the current Alaska Time Zone (UTC−09:00) was known as the Yukon Time Zone, observing Yukon Standard Time (YST). This time zone included Canada&#x27;s Yukon Territory and a small portion of Alaska including Yakutat. The Alaska Panhandle communities were in the Pacific Time Zone, while most of the interior was on UTC−10:00. Nome and the Aleutians previously observed Bering Standard Time or UTC−11:00. In 1975, the Yukon Territory switched to Pacific Standard Time, leaving Yakutat the only land area in the zone.

With the consolidation of Alaska&#x27;s four time zones into two in 1983, the entire state was in either a zone based on UTC−09:00 or UTC−10:00. The Yukon Time Zone based on UTC−09:00 was later renamed the Alaska Time Zone in 1984.

==Anomalies==
The Alaska Time Zone applies to the territory of the state of Alaska east of 169°30′ W, that is, the entire state minus the westernmost portions of the Aleutian Islands. Solar time zones are 15° wide.

UTC−09:00 time corresponds to the solar time at 9 × 15° = 135° W (roughly, Juneau, which is in the southeast panhandle). Thus, the westernmost locales of the Alaska Time Zone are off by up to 169°30′ − 135° = 34°30′ from local solar time, or slightly more than 2 hours and 17 minutes. At noon Alaskan Time at a location just east of 169°30′ W, local solar time is only about 9:42 a.m. The sun will not reach culmination for another 2 hours and 18 minutes.

When UTC−08:00 is applied in the summer (because of daylight saving time), this effect becomes even more apparent. For example, on June 12 at noon AKDT, the solar time at the extreme westerly points of the Alaskan time zone will be only 8:42 a.m., nearly 3 hours and 18 minutes behind clock time.

Very few people notice this, however, as these locations are virtually uninhabited, and for the very few people who do live there, the long days in the summer and short days in the winter make the sunrise and sunset times less important than areas closer to the equator. By contrast, in Juneau, which is much closer to the 135° west meridian, mean solar noon occurs around 11:57 a.m., very close to noon on the clock.

In Anchorage, visitors from more southerly latitudes are often surprised to see the sun set at 11:41 p.m. on the summer solstice while the solar time is 9:41 p.m. Anchorage is at 150° W, one hour further west from the solar time for UTC−09:00. Thus, Anchorage is one solar hour behind the legal time zone and observes daylight saving time as well for a two-hour discrepancy between legal time and solar time. Some local residents refer to this phenomenon as &quot;double daylight time&quot;.

In Fairbanks, the same circumstances cause sunset to occur at 12:47 a.m. the next calendar day and the solar sunset is at 10:47 p.m. Even without daylight saving time, another anomaly is that on the winter solstice in Nome, the sunrise is after &quot;noon&quot; clock time, at 12:02 p.m., about 4 hours before sunset at 3:56 p.m.

The territory of the state of Alaska spans almost as much longitude as the contiguous United States (57.5° vs. 57.6°) so the use of only two time zones will inevitably lead to some distortions. Alaska would naturally fall into five time zones, with the greatest territory more correctly in UTC−10:00 and UTC−11:00, with Adak more correctly in UTC–12:00 and Cape Wrangell in UTC–13:00 as sunset can be late as midnight. But political and logistical considerations have led to the use of two time zones, leading to the distortions mentioned above.

<doc id="524039" wikidata="Q7291308" url="?curid=524039" title="Rancho Santa Margarita">
<text>Rancho Santa Margarita was a Mexican land grant in the Santa Lucia Mountains, in present day San Luis Obispo County, central California. 

The rancho was granted by Governor pro tem Manuel Jimeno Casarin in 1841 to Joaquín Estrada. The grant encompassed present day Santa Margarita. It remains an active ranch.

==History==
Joaquín Tomas Estrada (1815–1893), the son of José Raimundo Estrada and Josefa Vallejo de Alvarado, was born in Spanish colonial Monterey, Alta California. Originally part of the northern lands of Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa, the four square league Rancho Santa Margarita was granted to Estrada in 1841. At the time, his older half brother Juan Bautista Alvarado was Governor of Alta California for independent México. Joaquín Estrada and his wife Maria de Jesus made their home at the adobe ranch headquarters. His brother Pedro Estrada was granted the adjacent Rancho Asuncion in 1845 after the Mexican secularization act of 1833. Joaquín Estrada was elected to the post-statehood first San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors in 1852, and served as County Treasurer in 1853–1854.

With the Mexican Cession of California to the United States following the Mexican–American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Santa Margarita was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852, and the grant was patented to Joaquín Estrada in 1861.

In 1861, Estrada sold the rancho to Martin Murphy Jr. (1807–1884) and his wife Mary Bulger Murphy (d.1892) of Sunnyvale, who had come to California with the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy Party in 1844. The Murphys turned over running of the rancho to their son Patrick Murphy, who was a General in the California National Guard. Patrick Washington Murphy (September 11, 1840 in Missouri – November 1, 1901 in San Francisco) operated Rancho Santa Margarita, and the adjacent Rancho Atascadero, and Rancho Asuncion, altogether comprising about from his Rancho Santa Margarita headquarters. Patrick Murphy married Mary Kate O&#x27;Brien in 1870. In 1876, Murphy bought the Rancho Cojo.

In 1889, Patrick Murphy enticed the Southern Pacific Railroad to Rancho Santa Margarita by selling them land near the ranch house. By 1890 Patrick Murphy&#x27;s efforts to entice further land buyers had largely failed, and Murphy died in 1901. In 1904, the Murphy family sold Rancho Santa Margarita to the three Reis brothers – Ferdinand, Christian and Gustav, German emigrants who made their fortune in the California Gold Rush.

<text>CKPR-DT (channel 2) is a television station in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, affiliated with CTV. It is owned by locally based Dougall Media alongside Global affiliate CHFD-DT (channel 4). Both stations share studios on Hill and Van Norman Streets in central Thunder Bay, while CKPR-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located in Shuniah, Ontario.

In June 2014, Dougall Media announced that the station would disaffiliate from CBC Television (with which it was affiliated since its 1954 sign-on) in September to become a CTV affiliate, bringing CTV back to the Thunder Bay market for the first time since sister station CHFD switched its affiliation from CTV to Global in 2010.

== History ==
CKPR-DT began broadcasting on October 4, 1954 as CFPA-TV. The &quot;PA&quot; stood for Port Arthur, where the station was licensed until it merged with Fort William to form Thunder Bay in 1970. The station was then owned by Ralph H. Parker Ltd. along with CFPA radio (AM 1230, now CKTG-FM). Three years later on July 20, 1957, Thunder Bay Electronics, owned by the Dougall family, bought CFPA-TV and changed its callsign letters to CFCJ-TV. They changed again ten years later in 1967, to CKPR-TV.

In 1972, Thunder Bay Electronics launched the CTV affiliate CHFD-TV (which switched to Global in 2010) and thus CKPR-TV and CHFD-TV became one of the first private twinstick stations in Canada.
In March 2010, CKPR announced it was unable to come to an agreement with CBC to continue to operate as an affiliate. CKPR filed an application with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) seeking to remove its condition of licence which mandates affiliation with CBC Television. The affiliation agreement would expire on August 31, 2011 and, according to the station would not be renewed by the CBC after that date. CKPR said that it was tentatively planning to disaffiliate as of September 1, 2010, but that it had yet to find a new programming source, and that it would be reserving the right to remain a CBC affiliate through the end of the 2010–2011 season, even if the relevant condition of licence was removed.

CKPR did not disaffiliate and continued negotiations with CBC. In March 2011, CKPR announced they had come to a programming agreement, under which the station would continue to provide CBC programming in Thunder Bay, which at the time was described as having a five-year term.

In early 2014, the station filed a new application to disaffiliate, indicating that it had the ability under its current agreement to opt out in September 2014. In June 2014, the CRTC approved CKPR&#x27;s request to disaffiliate from CBC while suggesting to both CKPR and CBC to &quot;consider alternate solutions&quot; in order to &quot;ensure the availability of the CBC&#x27;s service over-the-air&quot; in the Thunder Bay area.

On September 1, 2014, CKPR-DT disaffiliated from the CBC to become an affiliate of the CTV Television Network, which returned to local terrestrial television after sister station CHFD-TV disaffiliated from that network in 2010.

Despite the affiliation change, all TV service providers serving Thunder Bay, like all service providers across Canada, will continue to be required to include a CBC Television signal as part of their basic services. Shortly before the affiliation change, CBC confirmed that CBLT Toronto would be added to the basic packages of Shaw Communications cable systems in the area (channel 2 in Thunder Bay), and Tbaytel TV (channels 210 [SD] and 802 [HD]).

On January 27, 2016, Dougall Media officials revealed that CKPR and CHFD are both being sustained by the payouts from life insurance policies on former owner Fraser Dougall and a former general manager who both died in 2015, and said that the stations were likely to sign off for good by September 1, barring a favourable change in CRTC policies. Both stations, however, are still in operation.

== Distribution ==
As part of the CBC&#x27;s budget cuts, the operation of CBLK-TV and the other CBC-owned analogue rebroadcasters of private affiliates was discontinued on July 31, 2012.

== Programming ==
CKPR carries the majority of its programming in pattern with CTV&#x27;s Eastern Time schedule. The station broadcasts local newscasts at 6 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. under the &quot;TBT News&quot; branding; in lieu of local newscasts in these timeslots, CKPR simulcasts &quot;CTV News Ottawa&quot; from CJOH-DT at noon and 5 p.m. In the past, the station sometimes opted out of selected daytime and overnight programming for locally-sold paid programming.

Since March 2020, the station has broadcast &quot;HAGI TV Bingo&quot; —a weekly charity bingo event in support of Handicapped Action Group Incorporated (HAGI)—on Saturday nights throughout much of the year. The transition to televised games was originally prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic (with Gary Cooper, who had hosted the in-person event, hosting the televised games until his death in 2024), but has remained on the station since.

In many cases during its CBC affiliation (as of fall 2008, up to five times per day) CBC network shows broadcast during daytime or late-night on CKPR were preempted by paid programming. For example, with the &quot;Kids&#x27; CBC&quot; block having expanded to five hours on August 31, 2009, CKPR did not air the final hour of the expanded block, just like Corus-owned CBC affiliates (at the time) in Peterborough (CHEX-DT), Oshawa (CHEX-TV-2) and Kingston (CKWS-DT), opting for an hour of paid programming instead. Also, as of February 2010, CKPR also preempted a half-hour of &quot;Kids&#x27; CBC&quot; at 7 a.m. for a local morning newscast (which has since been cancelled with the affiliation switch in favor of &quot;Canada AM&quot;). Furthermore, in September 2011, as more programming toward adults, CKPR began preempting the 9-11 a.m. and the Saturday 11:30 a.m. block of &quot;Kids&#x27; CBC&quot; and a few months later in 2012, CKPR also began to preempt the 7:30 a.m. portion of &quot;Kids&#x27; CBC&quot; for more local and paid programming. The 9–11 a.m. block of &quot;Kids&#x27; CBC&quot; eventually returned in February 2012 but CKPR continued to decline the 7:30–8 a.m., 11 a.m.–noon and the Saturday 11:30 a.m.–noon blocks of &quot;Kids&#x27; CBC&quot;. CKPR also signs off most nights after the late-night talk show &quot;Conan&quot; on Monday to Thursday and the late network movie on weekends.

When CHFD was primarily a CTV affiliate, Global programs that could not be cleared by CHFD-DT, such as &quot;Survivor&quot;, would occasionally air on CKPR-DT instead. In the past, some CTV programming not cleared by CHFD may have also aired on CKPR.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
CKPR-DT flash cut to digital in early August 2011 alongside sister station CHFD.

Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display CKPR-DT&#x27;s virtual channel as 2.1.

In January 2011, Dougall Media applied with the CRTC to broadcast its digital signal instead on channel 2, following the digital conversion date.

<doc id="524043" wikidata="Q1051734" url="?curid=524043" title="Open Door Policy">
<text>The Open Door Policy () is the United States diplomatic policy established in the late 19th and early 20th century that called for a system of equal trade and investment and to guarantee the territorial integrity of Qing China. The policy was created in U.S. Secretary of State John Hay&#x27;s Open Door Note, dated September 6, 1899, and circulated to the major European powers. In order to prevent the &quot;carving of China like a melon&quot;, as they were doing in Africa, the Note asked the powers to keep China open to trade with all countries on an equal basis and called upon all powers, within their spheres of influence to refrain from interfering with any treaty port or any vested interest, to permit Chinese authorities to collect tariffs on an equal basis, and to show no favors to their own nationals in the matter of harbor dues or railroad charges. The policy was accepted only grudgingly, if at all, by the major powers, and it had no legal standing or enforcement mechanism. In July 1900, as the powers contemplated intervention to put down the violently anti-foreign Boxer uprising, Hay circulated a Second Open Door Note affirming the principles. Over the next decades, American policy-makers and national figures continued to refer to the Open Door Policy as a basic doctrine, and Chinese diplomats appealed to it as they sought American support, but critics pointed out that the policy had little practical effect.

The term &quot;Open Door&quot; also describes the economic policy initiated by Deng Xiaoping in 1978 to open China to foreign businesses that wanted to invest in the country. The policy set into motion the economic transformation of China. In the 20th and 21st centuries, scholars such as Christopher Layne in the neorealist school have generalized the use of the term to applications in &#x27;political&#x27; open door policies and &#x27;economic&#x27; open door policies of nations in general, which interact on a global or international basis.

== Background ==
The theory of the Open Door Policy originated with British commercial practice, as reflected in treaties concluded with the Qing dynasty China after the First Opium War (1839–1842) which included most favored nation provisions designed to keep any one nation from gaining an advantage. The concept was seen at the Berlin Conference of 1885, which declared that no power could levy preferential duties in the Congo. As a concept and policy, the Open Door Policy was a principle that was never formally adopted via treaty or international law. It was invoked or alluded to but never enforced as such. The policy collapsed in 1931 when the Japanese seized and kept Manchuria, despite international disapproval. Technically, the term Open Door Policy is applicable only before the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949. After Deng Xiaoping took power in 1978, the term referred to China&#x27;s policy of opening up to foreign business that wanted to invest in the country, which set into motion the economic transformation of modern China.
==History==
===Formation of policy===
With its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), China faced an imminent threat of being partitioned and colonized by imperial powers with a presence in China (which included France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Japan, and Russia). After winning the Spanish–American War of 1898, with the newly acquired territory of the Philippine Islands, the United States increased its Asian presence and expected to further its commercial and political interests in China. It felt threatened by other powers&#x27; much larger spheres of influence in China and worried that it might lose access to the Chinese market if it were to be partitioned. As a response, William Woodville Rockhill formulated the Open Door Policy to safeguard American business opportunities and other interests in China. On September 6, 1899, U.S. Secretary of State John Hay sent notes to the major powers (France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Japan, and Russia) to ask them to declare formally that they would uphold Chinese territorial and administrative integrity and they would not interfere with the free use of the treaty ports in their spheres of influence in China. The Open Door Policy stated that all nations, including the United States, could enjoy equal access to the Chinese market. Hay&#x27;s logic was that American economic power would then be able to dominate the Chinese market and fend off other foreign competitors.

In reply, each country tried to evade Hay&#x27;s request by taking the position that it could not commit itself until the other nations had complied. However, by July 1900, Hay announced that each of the powers had granted its consent in principle. Although treaties after 1900 referred to the Open Door Policy, competition continued abated among the various powers for special concessions within China for railroad rights, mining rights, loans, foreign trade ports, and so forth.

On October 6, 1900, Britain and Germany signed the Yangtze Agreement to oppose the partition of China into spheres of influence. The agreement, signed by Lord Salisbury and Ambassador Paul von Hatzfeldt, was an endorsement of the Open Door Policy. The Germans supported it because a partition of China would limit Germany to a small trading market, instead of all of China.

===Subsequent development===
The policy built popular sympathy for China and raised hopes for a vast &quot;China market&quot; and American influence in China&#x27;s development. The effect of the policy was partly diplomatic, but it also reflected what the historian Michael Hunt calls a &quot;paternalistic vision&quot; of &quot;defending and reforming China.&quot; This vision defined China in terms of two struggles, first, a Chinese domestic struggle between progressive reform and feudal inertia, and the second an international struggle which pitted the &quot;selfish imperialism&quot; of Britain, Russia, and Japan against the supposedly benevolent policies of the United States. Over the next decades, American diplomats, missionaries, and businessmen took a special interest in China, many of them envisioning that China would follow the American example.

However these dreams proved difficult to realize. American investments, while considerable, did not reach major proportions; the Open Door policy could not protect China against Japanese interference, first the Manchurian Incident of 1931, then the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), and Chinese leaders, while willing to seek American aid, were not willing to play the passive role that the Open Door implied.

In 1902, the U.S. government protested that the Russian incursion into Manchuria after the Boxer Rebellion was a violation of the Open Door Policy. When Japan replaced Russia in southern Manchuria after the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) the Japanese and American governments pledged to maintain a policy of equality in Manchuria. In 1905–1907 Japan made overtures to enlarge its sphere of influence to include Fujian. Japan was trying to obtain French loans and also avoid the Open Door Policy. Paris provided loans on condition that Japan respect the Open Door principles and not violate China&#x27;s territorial integrity.

In finance, American efforts to preserve the Open Door Policy led in 1909 to the formation of an international banking consortium through which all Chinese railroad loans agreed in 1917 to another exchange of notes between the United States and Japan. There were renewed assurances that the Open Door Policy would be respected, but the United States would recognize Japan&#x27;s special interests in China (the Lansing–Ishii Agreement). The Open Door Policy had been further weakened by a series of secret treaties in 1917 between Japan and the Allied Triple Entente that promised Japan the German possessions in China after the successful conclusion of World War I. The subsequent realization of the promise in the 1919 Versailles Treaty angered the Chinese public and sparked the protest known as the May Fourth Movement. The Nine-Power Treaty, signed in 1922, expressly reaffirmed the Open Door Policy. In 1949, the United States State Department issued the &quot;China White Paper&quot;, a selection of official documents on United States-China relations, 1900–1949. The introductory &quot;Letter of Transmittal,&quot; signed by Secretary of State Dean Acheson, asserted that the United States policy had consistently maintained fundamental principles, &quot;which include the doctrine of the Open Door...&quot;

Since the policy effectively hindered Chinese sovereignty, the government of the Republic of China endeavored to revise the related treaties with foreign powers in the 1920s and 1930s. However, only after the conclusion of World War II would China manage to regain its full sovereignty.

===In modern China===

In China&#x27;s modern economic history, the Open Door Policy refers to the new policy announced by Deng Xiaoping in December 1978 to open the door to foreign businesses that wanted to set up in China. Special Economic Zones (SEZ) were set up in 1980 in his belief that to modernize China&#x27;s industry and boost its economy, he needed to welcome foreign direct investment. Chinese economic policy then shifted to encouraging and supporting foreign trade and investment. It was the turning point in China&#x27;s economic fortune, which started its way on the path to becoming &#x27;The World&#x27;s Factory&#x27;.

Four SEZs were initially set up in 1980: Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shantou in Guangdong, and Xiamen in Fujian. The SEZs were strategically located near Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan but with a favorable tax regime and low wages to attract capital and business from these Chinese communities. Shenzhen was the first to be established and showed the most rapid growth, averaging a very high growth rate of 40% per annum between 1981 and 1993, compared to the average GDP growth of 9.8% for the country as a whole. Other SEZs were set up in other parts of China.

In 1978, China was ranked 32nd in the world in export volume, but by 1989, it had doubled its world trade and became the 13th exporter. Between 1978 and 1990, the average annual rate of trade expansion was above 15 percent, and a high rate of growth continued for the next decade. In 1978, its exports in the world market share was negligible and in 1998, it still had less than 2%, but by 2010, it had a world market share of 10.4% according to the World Trade Organization (WTO), with merchandise export sales of more than $1.5 trillion, the highest in the world. In 2013, China overtook the United States and became the world&#x27;s biggest trading nation in goods, with a total for imports and exports valued at US$4.16 trillion for the year.

On 21 July 2020, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping made a speech to a group of public and private business leaders at the entrepreneur forum in Beijing. Xi emphasized that &quot;We must gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic internal circulation as the main body and the domestic and international dual circulations mutually promoting each other.&quot;
Since then &quot;internal circulation&quot; became a hot word in China. Some Chinese worry that the emphasis of &quot;internal circulation&quot;signals returning to 1960s-era seclusion, and ending of open door policy.

==Applications in 20th and 21st centuries==
Scholars such as Christopher Layne in the neorealist school have generalized the use of the term to applications in &#x27;political&#x27; open door policies and &#x27;economic&#x27; open door policies of nations in general, which interact on a global or international basis.

William Appleman Williams, considered as the foremost member of the &quot;Wisconsin School&quot; of diplomatic history, departed from the mainstream of U.S. historiography in the 1950s by arguing that the United States was more responsible for the Cold War than the Soviet Union by expanding as an empire. Pivoting the history of American diplomacy on the Open Door Policy, Williams described the policy as &quot;America&#x27;s version of the liberal policy of informal empire or free trade imperialism.&quot; That was the central thesis in his book, &quot;The Tragedy of American Diplomacy&quot;.

<text>George Turner (born 9 August 1940) is a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom.

==Early life==
Turner attended Laxton Grammar School (now part of Oundle School) on North Street in Oundle. At Imperial College London he gained a BSc in Physics, then obtained a PhD in Physics from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He then became Head of the Electrical Engineering Department at the University of East Anglia.

==Parliamentary career==
Turner contested North West Norfolk on behalf of Labour in 1992, but failed to be elected. He was returned as the member of parliament (MP) for the constituency in 1997, but lost his seat back to Henry Bellingham of the Conservative Party – whom he had first defeated – in 2001.

In defeating Bellingham in 1997 Turner benefitted from a somewhat curious echo of a famous historical episode, as noted by the Conservative peer and historian Lord Lexden during a debate in the House of Lords in 2012. Referring to Spencer Perceval, the only Prime Minister to have been assassinated, Lexden remarked in that debate: &quot;My Lords, would my noble friend think of reminding Mr Henry Bellingham that he has already experienced the Perceval family&#x27;s taste for revenge, having been deprived of his Commons seat at the 1997 election by a direct descendant of the assassinated Prime Minister?&quot; Perceval&#x27;s descendant was a third candidate in the constituency, Roger Percival of the Referendum Party, who in Lexden&#x27;s view had deprived Bellingham (in turn a kinsman of Spencer Perceval&#x27;s assassin, John Bellingham, and thus a suitable target for &quot;revenge&quot;) of a critical number of votes in the election, thereby delivering victory to George Turner.

==Personal life==
He married Lesley Duggan. He has two daughters a stepson &amp; stepdaughter.

<doc id="524045" wikidata="Q3241537" url="?curid=524045" title="Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone">
<text>The Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone observes Hawaii–Aleutian Standard Time (HST) by subtracting ten hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC−10:00). The clock time in this zone is based on the mean solar time of the 150th meridian west of the Greenwich Observatory.

The zone takes its name from the two areas it includes: Hawaii and the portion of Alaska&#x27;s Aleutian Islands west of 169° 30 W longitude.

During daylight saving time (DST), the Alaskan portion observes Hawaii–Aleutian Daylight Time (HDT, UTC−09:00), while Hawaii stays on standard time. Hawaii has not observed daylight saving time since September 1945.

Until 1947, UTC−10:30 was used as standard time in Hawaii. On June 8 of that year, a new territorial law moved Hawaiian Standard Time 30 minutes ahead.

Hawaii–Aleutian Standard Time was established to maintain consistency in the scheduling of business and government activities across Hawaii and the Aleutian Islands.

French Polynesia uses UTC−10:00 for its major cities. The Cook Islands also use the same time. These areas do not use DST. &quot;Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone&quot; is a U.S. term and for that reason the Polynesian areas are not considered to be a part of the Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone.

The largest city and metropolitan area in the Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone are Honolulu and its metropolitan area, respectively.

== Major metropolitan areas ==
*Honolulu, Hawaii
*Hilo, Hawaii
*Kahului, Hawaii
*Kailua-Kona, Hawaii
*Kapaa, Hawaii

== Other significant places ==
*Adak Island, Alaska
*Johnston Atoll

<text>Mabel Louise Smith (May 1, 1924 – January 23, 1972), known professionally as Big Maybelle, was an American R&amp;B singer. Her 1956 hit single &quot;Candy&quot; received the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999.

==Childhood and musical background==
Born in Jackson, Tennessee, on May 1, 1924, Big Maybelle sang gospel as a child; by her teens, she had switched to rhythm and blues. She began her professional career with Dave Clark&#x27;s Memphis Band in 1936, and also toured with the all-female International Sweethearts of Rhythm. She then joined Christine Chatman&#x27;s Orchestra, and made her first recordings with Chatman in 1944, before recording with the Tiny Bradshaw&#x27;s Orchestra from 1947 to 1950.

Her debut solo recordings, recorded as Mabel Smith, were for King Records in 1947. 

==Okeh Records==
In 1952, she was signed by Okeh Records, whose record producer Fred Mendelsohn gave her the stage name &#x27;Big Maybelle&#x27; because of her loud yet well-toned voice. Her first recording for Okeh, &quot;Gabbin&#x27; Blues&quot;, was a number 3 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart, and was followed up by both &quot;Way Back Home&quot; and &quot;My Country Man&quot; in 1953.

In 1955, she recorded the song &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin&#x27; Goin&#x27; On&quot;, produced by up-and-coming producer Quincy Jones, a full two years before rockabilly then rock and roll singer Jerry Lee Lewis&#x27;s version. Lewis credited Smith&#x27;s version as being the inspiration to make his version much more louder, raunchy and raucous, with a driving beat and a spoken section with a come-on that was considered very risque for the time.

==Savoy Records==
More hits followed throughout the 1950s, particularly after signing with Savoy Records later in 1955, including &quot;Candy&quot; (1956), one of her biggest sellers.

During this time, she also appeared on stage at the Apollo Theater in New York City in 1957, and at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival she sang &quot;All Night Long/I Ain&#x27;t Mad at You&quot;, as seen in Bert Stern&#x27;s film of the festival, &quot;Jazz on a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot;, in which Mahalia Jackson and Dinah Washington also performed.

==Career decline==
After 1959, she recorded for a variety of labels, but the hits largely dried up. She continued to perform into the early 1960s. Her last hit single was in 1967, a cover of &quot;96 Tears&quot; by Question Mark &amp; the Mysterians. By the 1960s, Maybelle&#x27;s drug use began detrimentally impacting her career.

==Death==
Smith died of a diabetic coma on January 23, 1972, in Cleveland, Ohio. She had been frequently ill for the previous 18 months. She was survived by her only child, Barbara Smith, and five grandchildren.

Her final album, &quot;Last of Big Maybelle&quot;, was released posthumously in 1973.

==Legacy==
The album &quot;The Okeh Sessions&quot;, released on the Epic label, won the 1983 W.C. Handy Award for &quot;Vintage or Reissue Album of the Year (U.S.)&quot;.
In 2011, she was inducted to the Blues Hall of Fame.

Her version of &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin&#x27; Goin&#x27; On&quot; was included in the soundtrack for &quot;Fallout 4&quot; as part of the Diamond City Radio playlist.

<doc id="524051" wikidata="Q333807" url="?curid=524051" title="Jim Wallace, Baron Wallace of Tankerness">
<text>James Robert Wallace, Baron Wallace of Tankerness, (born 25 August 1954) is a Scottish politician serving as a Liberal Democrat life peer in the British House of Lords since 2007. He served as the Deputy First Minister of Scotland from 1999 to 2005, and during that time he served twice as acting First Minister, in 2000, in the aftermath of Donald Dewar&#x27;s death and in 2001, following Henry McLeish&#x27;s resignation.

He was formerly Leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats from 1992 to 2005 and Leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords from 2013 to 2016. Wallace also served as the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland from 2021 to 2022. 

Wallace served as a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament (MP) for Orkney and Shetland from 1983 to 2001 and a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Orkney from 1999 to 2007. He also served as Advocate General for Scotland from 2010 to 2015. He was the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland from 1 May 2021 to 23 May 2022.

==Early life and education==
Wallace was born in Annan in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, and grew up there. He has a brother, Neil. As a boy, his first interest in politics was stoked when he collected autographs from politicians visiting the local area: he still possesses one from Tam Dalyell, with whom he later served in the House of Commons.

Wallace was educated at Annan Academy, a state secondary school in his hometown of Annan. Following school, he was accepted by Downing College, Cambridge, where he obtained a joint BA degree in economics and law. From there he returned to Scotland to study law at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with an LLB degree in 1977. Based in Edinburgh, he practised as an advocate at the Scottish Bar, mostly in civil law cases.

==Political career==
===Member of Parliament (UK)===
Wallace joined the then-Liberal Party in the early 1970s, but did not become very active in it until after completing his second degree. His first foray as a parliamentary candidate was in the constituency of Dumfriesshire in 1979, where he failed to win. He also stood, unsuccessfully, as the Liberal candidate in the South of Scotland constituency at the European Parliament elections of that year.

Four years later, he would earn the Liberal nomination for the seat of Orkney and Shetland, the seat being vacated by former party leader Jo Grimond, and won election to the Parliament. At the time, it was extremely rare for Liberal candidates to successfully win elections to succeed former Liberal MPs, although many have since done so. He was to serve as the MP there for 18 years, occupying a number of front bench posts for the Liberal Party (and, from 1988 onwards, the Liberal Democrats), including Employment spokesman and Chief Whip.

In 1992, he was unopposed in becoming the new leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, succeeding Malcolm Bruce. Scottish politics at this time was dominated by the question of constitutional reform. There were few opportunities for legislation affecting Scots Law to be debated or effectively scrutinised at Westminster and, especially after the 1987 Election, with only ten Conservative MPs in Scotland but with a large majority in the House of Commons, it was argued that there was a democratic deficit in Scotland.

He led the Scottish Liberal Democrats in the first election to the new Scottish Parliament in 1999, himself winning the constituency of Orkney with 67% of the votes cast. This meant he served as a Member of both the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments for a time with a dual mandate, although like other MPs elected to Holyrood (such as John Swinney, John Home Robertson and Donald Gorrie) he stood down from Westminster at the 2001 General Election.

===Member of the Scottish Parliament===
As expected, the proportional election system for the new Scottish Parliament meant that Labour failed to gain an outright majority in the first elections. Their leader, Donald Dewar, chose to seek a formal coalition government with a working majority rather than try to operate as a minority government.

====Deputy First Minister====
He contacted Wallace and a week of formal negotiations were held between the two parties&#x27; representatives, following which a partnership agreement was signed, committing both parties to support a negotiated joint agenda. Wallace became Deputy First Minister and Minister for Justice, and maintained these briefs throughout the first term of the Parliament.

The decision to enter a coalition government with Labour was controversial at the time. British politicians were unaccustomed to coalition politics, and the Liberal Democrats came under fire from Conservative and SNP opponents who claimed they had &#x27;sold out&#x27; their principles. Key to this criticism was the Labour policy of making students pay tuition fees, which the Liberal Democrats had promised to abolish as their price of entering a coalition, but which became merely the subject of an inquiry as the coalition was formed.

In the event, the Liberal Democrats did insist on the abolition of tuition fees after the inquiry reported in 2001, but in 1999, the delay was perceived to have been a compromise, and Wallace in particular became the focal point for extremely bitter criticism. Despite this, and other difficult moments, he and his party stayed firm and remained in power. Wallace established himself as a minister.

====Acting First Minister====
On three occasions over the first term of the Parliament, he became Acting First Minister: twice in 2000 due to at first the illness, and later the death, of the first First Minister Donald Dewar, and then again in 2001, after the resignation of Dewar&#x27;s successor as First Minister, Henry McLeish. Each occasion lasted for only a few weeks.

Under his continued leadership, the Scottish Liberal Democrats&#x27; popularity grew steadily. After leading the party through the second Holyrood elections in 2003 Elections, again winning 17 MSPs but with a higher share of the vote, he led the party into a second coalition with Labour. The 2003 coalition negotiation process was widely seen as a more successful enterprise by the Liberal Democrats than the preceding one, with key aspects of Labour&#x27;s proposals on anti-social behaviour dropped or limited, and with the promise of proportional representation for Scotland&#x27;s 32 local councils.

Wallace remained as Deputy First Minister, but left the Justice brief, becoming instead the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning.

===Resignation and peerage===

On 9 May 2005, following the 2005 General Election, Wallace announced his intention to stand down as party leader and Deputy First Minister. He would remain as MSP for Orkney until the 2007 election, but would serve his time out as a backbencher. He ceased to be an MSP with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament on 2 April 2007.

On 13 September 2007, it was announced that he was to be appointed to the House of Lords. He was subsequently created a life peer on 17 October 2007 taking the title Baron Wallace of Tankerness, &quot;of Tankerness in Orkney&quot;. Wallace also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2007 

On 28 April 2008, it was announced that the new Lord Wallace would be a member of the Commission on Scottish Devolution, chaired by Sir Kenneth Calman, established by the Scottish Parliament to consider the future powers of the Parliament, including powers over finance. This is a distinct exercise from the SNP Government&#x27;s national conversation.

In November 2008, Wallace received a lifetime achievement award in the Scottish Politician of the Year Awards.

In May 2010, he was appointed Advocate General for Scotland, one of the Law Officers of the Crown, who advise the government on Scots law.

He was elected unopposed, as the leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords on 15 October 2013, replacing Lord McNally, who had stepped down earlier in the month.

In September 2016, he stepped down as the Leader of the Liberal Democrat in the House of Lords, citing a desire to step back from &quot;frontline&quot; politics stating &quot;I was first elected to the House of Commons 33 years ago. For 28 of these years, I have been on the frontline, including sixteen years in a leadership role, here in the Lords and in Scotland.&quot;

== Honours and awards ==
In 2018 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

== Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland ==
A longstanding Elder of the Church of Scotland at St. Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall, he was nominated and appointed to be Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for 2021–2022. It is highly unusual for a lay person to be nominated as Moderator, predecessors being Alison Elliot in 2004 and George Buchanan in 1567.

==Personal life==
Wallace married Rosemary (née Fraser) a speech therapist in 1983, who he calls &quot;Rosie&quot;. The couple have two daughters: Helen and Clare. He has two sons-in-law, Andrew and James, two granddaughters, Catriona and Ella and one grandson, Adam.
Wallace is an elder of the Church of Scotland, attending St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall, Orkney.

He is a Vice President of the National Churches Trust.

<doc id="524057" wikidata="Q335747" url="?curid=524057" title="Hector Monro, Baron Monro of Langholm">
<text>Hector Seymour Peter Monro, Baron Monro of Langholm, AE, PC (4 October 1922 – 30 August 2006), was a Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party politician. He was Member of Parliament for Dumfriesshire for over 32 years, from 1964 to 1997, and then a life peer in the House of Lords.

After piloting flying boats in the Second World War, Monro became a farmer in his native Dumfriesshire. He became active in local test politics in the 1950s, and was elected as MP for Dumfries in 1964. He served as a Conservative whip and held three junior ministerial positions, twice in the Scottish Office and once as Minister for Sport in the Department for the Environment. He became a member of the House of Lords in 1997, after he stood down from the House of Commons. He was particularly concerned with Scottish and rural issues, the RAF, and sport, and was noted for his strong links with his constituency. He was in office at the time of the Lockerbie Disaster in 1988, which occurred in his constituency.

==Early and private life==
Monro was born in Edinburgh and raised at Craigcleuch near Langholm in Dumfriesshire. His father, Alistair Monro, was a captain in the Cameron Highlanders; his maternal grandfather was Lieutenant General Sir Spencer Ewart. Monro was educated at Upland House School in Sussex, Canford School in Dorset, and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

He was a member of the Cambridge University Air Squadron at Cambridge. After only one year at Cambridge, he joined the RAF in 1941, becoming a flight lieutenant in Coastal Command, flying Atlantic patrols in Short Sunderland flying boats and then in the Far East in Catalinas.
After he was demobbed in 1946, he became a farmer at Kirtlebridge near Lockerbie, although he also had other business interests. He remained a member of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force from 1947 to 1954. He was later an honorary Air Commodore from 1982 to 2000, and its honorary Inspector General from 1990 to 2000.

Monro married twice. He married Anne Welch in 1949. Their two sons joined the British Army. Seymour retired as a major-general; Hughie is a retired brigadier. Monro&#x27;s first wife died in 1994; later that year, he married a second time, to Doris Kaestner, a friend of his first wife. Monro&#x27;s grandson, Ander Monro, has played for the Canada national rugby union team.

==Political career==
Monro was elected as a Dumfries County Councillor from 1952, where he served until 1967. He was chairman and vice-president of the Dumfries Unionist Party and was elected MP for Dumfries in the 1964 general election, retaining his seat until he retired at the 1997 general election.

He became a Conservative whip in 1968, and was a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Scottish Office between 28 July 1971 and 28 February 1974. He voted against his party on Scottish devolution, announcing his support for a Scottish Assembly in 1974.

After the Conservatives lost the February 1974 general election, he was an opposition spokesman, initially on Scottish affairs and then on sport, until 1979. After the 1979 general election, he was appointed as Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s first Minister for Sport, as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of the Environment under Michael Heseltine. He also had responsibility for some environmental issues, and was involved in strengthening the provisions of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

Monro came under some criticism for opposing the visit of a South African Barbarians rugby team to the UK and a return visit by the British Lions rugby team the next year. He was dropped from the Government in 1981 in the wake of Mrs Thatcher&#x27;s proposal that the British team pull out of the Moscow Olympics, receiving a consolatory knighthood that year. In 1986, he suggested that the government bill the Kremlin in the amount of £1 million and provide the amount to Scottish farmers in compensation for losses to sheep herds caused by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

In 1988, a bomb exploded on Pan Am Flight 103, which crashed at Lockerbie, near his home. He was closely involved in the aftermath as the local constituency MP, and went out to Lockerbie with two other MPs. He was hailed by politicians of all political stripes for his compassion and caring; Scottish Labour MP Brian Wilson praised him as &quot;a man who is truly a part of the community that he represents&quot;.

He returned to the Scottish Office on 9 April 1992, but he was sacked from this position on 5 July 1995. He became a member of the Privy Council in 1995, and following his retirement as an MP, was made a life peer as Baron Monro of Langholm, of Westerkirk in Dumfries and Galloway on 6 November 1997.

The number of Conservative MPs from Scotland declined from 24 when he was first elected an MP in 1964 to nil after the 1997 general election. A One Nation Conservative, he occasionally rebelled against the official party line, opposing the closing of British Steel Corporation&#x27;s Ravenscraig steelworks, for example. One of his Labour Party opponents, Norman Hogg, dubbed him &quot;the last of the decent Tories&quot;.

==Outside politics==
Monro was a president of the Scottish Rugby Union, and he was honorary president of Langholm RFC for over 20 years. He managed the 1970 rugby union tour to Australia but had to return home to fight the 1970 General Election.

He was a long-serving member of the Nature Conservancy Council, and active in the National Farmers Union of Scotland. He was a member of the Royal Company of Archers, a deputy lieutenant of Dumfriesshire, and enjoyed vintage cars and country sports.

<text>Komsomolets Island () is the northernmost island of the Severnaya Zemlya group in the Russian Arctic, and the third largest island in the group. It is the 82nd largest island on earth. About 65% of the island is covered with glaciers, including Russia&#x27;s largest, the Academy of Sciences Glacier.

==Geography==
Komsomolets Island is separated from October Revolution Island in the south by the Red Army Strait and from Pioneer Island in the southwest by the Yuny Strait. The northernmost point of the island is the Arctic Cape, the launching point for many Arctic expeditions.

Practically the whole of the central and southern part of the island is covered by the massive Academy of Sciences Glacier, between Krenkel Bay in the east and Zhuravlev Bay in the west. The northern part is largely unglaciated. The area of this island has been estimated at 9,006 km2. It rises to a height of 780 m. Komsomolets Island is home to the largest ice cap in Russia, the Academy of Sciences Ice Cap.

==Geology==
The soil of the island is mostly composed of loose loam and sands, a tundra desert scattered with mosses and lichens.

==History==
The island was discovered by Boris Vilkitsky in 1913, but it was not proven to be an island until 1931, when Georgy Ushakov and Nikolay Urvantsev charted the archipelago during their 1930–32 expedition. They also named it. In keeping with their tradition of naming the islands after events and movements of the Russian Revolution, this island was named in honour of the members of the Komsomol, the &quot;Communist Union of Youth.&quot;

<text>Dougall Media is a Canadian media company which has several television, radio and publishing holdings in Northwestern Ontario.

==Television==
Dougall Media owns CKPR, a CTV affiliate (formerly a CBC affiliate until August 31, 2014), and CHFD, a Global affiliate, both in Thunder Bay, Ontario. The two stations are what is known as a twinstick operation, and are in fact the sole remaining locally owned twinstick anywhere in English Canada (Stingray Group&#x27;s twinstick in Lloydminster is not locally owned since Stingray is a national company based in Montreal). The two stations air programs from their respective networks, as well as local news and current affairs programs and specials.

Prior to February 2010, CHFD was a CTV affiliate which also carried some Global programming. The station was unable to come to agreement with CTV to continue operating as an affiliate and filed an application to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to remove the CTV affiliation requirement from their license and to operate as a Global affiliate.

In March 2010, CKPR announced it was unable to come to an agreement with CBC to continue to operate as an affiliate, and filed an application with the CRTC to remove the CBC affiliation requirement from their license. CKPR stated in their application that it &quot;would operate as an independent local station and intends to source its non-local programming&quot;. However, after continued negotiations, the station announced in March 2011 that they had come to an agreement that would see them air CBC programming for another five years; in June 2014, Dougall Media announced that CKPR&#x27;s affiliation would switch from CBC to CTV in September.

The stations&#x27; status as a locally owned twinstick accounts for some of the unique circumstances of the Thunder Bay television market. For example, Thunder Bay was the only major market in the province in which CIII-DT and CHCH-DT did &quot;not&quot; add rebroadcasters during those stations&#x27; provincewide expansions in the 1990s; although both stations did apply for transmitters in Thunder Bay, both were declined by the CRTC due to the potential impact of out-of-market competition on Dougall&#x27;s advertising revenue. It is also, for the same reason, the only major market in the province where CITY-DT is still unavailable either terrestrially or on basic cable.

Dougall has also previously cited CTV&#x27;s cost-cutting measures of the early 2000s, such as the merger of all local news on the four CTV Northern Ontario stations in Northeastern Ontario into a single newscast produced in Sudbury, as a key factor in its refusal to consider selling the stations, lest such a sale result in the loss of local programming in Thunder Bay.

On January 27, 2016, Dougall Media officials revealed that CKPR and CHFD are both being sustained by the payouts from life insurance policies on former owner Fraser Dougall and a former general manager who both died in 2015, and at the time said the stations could sign off for good by September 1, 2016, barring a favourable change in CRTC policies. As of October 2023 the stations remained in operation.

===Branding===
The two stations were formerly united under the brand Thunder Bay Television. However, upon becoming a Global affiliate in February 2010, CHFD rebranded as Global Thunder Bay, following a branding scheme used at Global owned and operated stations. CKPR continued to use the Thunder Bay Television brand until May 2012, when it rebranded as CKPR Thunder Bay. Prior to this, the stations usually used the on-air branding scheme of &quot;Thunder Bay Television&quot; and then the name of the network to which the channel was affiliated, except in cases when the channel was airing programming that wasn&#x27;t from the network to which it was affiliated. For example, CKPR-TV was normally branded as &quot;Thunder Bay Television - CBC&quot;, however, while airing non-CBC programming, such as &quot;TB News&quot;, it was branded as &quot;Thunder Bay Television - CKPR&quot;. Both stations still, however, air local newscasts under the single brand &quot;TBT News&quot;.

==Radio==
Dougall Media owns CKPR and CJSD in Thunder Bay, as well as CFNO in Marathon.

==Print==
Dougall Media publishes a free weekly community newspaper, &quot;Thunder Bay Source&quot;, which is delivered to 35,000 households in Thunder Bay each Friday. The paper covers local news, including city council, education, health care, Indigenous issues and the local federal and provincial political scene, as well as weekly entertainment and sports features. It also hosts a selection of local columnists, including 
J.R. Shermack and former CBC Radio personality Fred Jones, a weekly movie column by North of Superior Film Association president Marty Mascarin, a food-related column by Derek Lankinen and an outdoor column by Keith Ailey.

It was formerly known as &quot;Thunder Bay Post&quot;, a name that was discontinued in October 2003. Prior to that it was known as &quot;Lakehead Living&quot;.

The paper&#x27;s editorial staff also contributes to the news websites TbNewsWatch.com, NWONewswatch.com and SNNewswatch.com, which also have material contributed from the company&#x27;s radio and television newsrooms.

<text>Mark Catesby (24 March 1683 – 23 December 1749) was an English naturalist who studied the flora and fauna of the New World. Between 1729 and 1747, Catesby published his &quot;Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;, the first published account of the flora and fauna of North America. It included 220 plates of birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, insects, mammals and plants.

==Life and works==
Catesby was born on 24 March 1683 and baptised at Castle Hedingham, Essex on 30 March 1683. His father, John Catesby (buried 12 November 1703), was a local politician and gentleman farmer. His mother was Elizabeth Jekyll (buried 5 September 1708). The family owned a farm and house, Holgate, in Sudbury, Suffolk as well as property in London. An acquaintance with the naturalist John Ray led to Catesby becoming interested in natural history. The death of his father left Catesby enough to live on, so in 1712, he accompanied his sister Elizabeth to Williamsburg, Virginia. She was the wife of Dr. William Cocke, who had been a member of the Council and Secretary of State for the Colony of Virginia. According to their father&#x27;s will, Elizabeth had married Dr. Cocke against her father&#x27;s wishes. Catesby visited the West Indies in 1714, and returned to Virginia, then home to England in 1719.

Catesby had collected seeds and botanical specimens in Virginia and Jamaica. He sent the pressed specimens to Dr. Samuel Dale of Braintree in Essex, and gave seeds to a Hoxton nurseryman Thomas Fairchild as well as to Dale and to the Bishop of London, Dr Henry Compton. Plants from Virginia, raised from Catesby&#x27;s seeds, made his name known to gardeners and scientists in England, and in 1722 he was recommended by William Sherard to undertake a plant-collecting expedition to Carolina on behalf of certain members of the Royal Society. From May 1722, Catesby was based in Charleston, South Carolina, and travelled to other parts of that colony, collecting plants and animals. He sent preserved specimens to Hans Sloane and to William Sherard, and seeds to various contacts including Sherard and Peter Collinson. Consequently, Catesby was responsible for introducing such plants as &quot;Catalpa bignonioides&quot; and the eponymous &quot;Catesbaea spinosa&quot; (lilythorn) to cultivation in Europe. Catesby returned to England in 1726.

Catesby spent the next twenty years preparing and publishing his &quot;Natural History&quot;. Publication was financed by subscriptions from his &quot;Encouragers&quot; as well as an interest-free loan from one of the fellows of the Royal Society, the Quaker Peter Collinson. Catesby learnt how to etch the copper plates himself. The first eight plates had no backgrounds, but from then on Catesby included plants with his animals. He completed the first part in May 1729 and presented it to Queen Caroline; first volume, comprising five parts, was finished in November 1732. Mark Catesby was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in February 1733 and was made a member of the Society of Gentlemen of Spalding in December 1743. The second volume containing another five parts was completed in December 1743, and in 1747 he produced a supplement from material sent to him by friends in America, particularly John Bartram, and also his younger brother, John, who was based with a British regiment in Gibraltar. Not all the plates in &quot;Natural history&quot; are by Catesby: several, including the splendid and famous image of &quot;Magnolia grandiflora&quot; were by Georg Ehret. Catesby&#x27;s original preparatory drawings for &quot;Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot; are in the Royal Library, Windsor Castle, and selections have been exhibited in USA, Japan and various places in England including at the Queen&#x27;s Gallery, London, in 1997–1998, and Gainsborough&#x27;s House in Sudbury in 2015.
On 5 March 1747, Catesby read a paper entitled &quot;Of birds of passage&quot; to the Royal Society in London, and he is now recognised as one of the first people to describe bird migration.

Mark Catesby married Elizabeth Rowland on 8 October 1747 in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Hyde Park Corner, but they had been a couple for about 17 years, having at least six children between April 1731 and June 1740. They were parishioners of St Giles Cripplegate in London and later, when that parish was subdivided, of St Luke Old Street. He died just before Christmas 1749 on Saturday 23 December in his house behind St Luke Old Street, London, and was buried in its churchyard. His grave is now lost. Catesby&#x27;s &quot;Hortus britanno-americanus ...&quot; was published posthumously in 1763, and a second edition, entitled &quot;Hortus Europae americanus ...&quot; was issued in 1767.

The Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus included information from Catesby&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; (1758). Linnaeus cited Catesby&#x27;s book for 81 bird species and for 33 of these Catesby was the only author cited.

==Legacy==
&quot;Catesbaea&quot;, lilythorn, a genus of thorny shrubs belonging to Rubiaceae (madder family) from the West Indies and southeastern USA was named after Catesby, originally by Jan Frederik Gronovius. However, under present rules of nomenclature, this name was formally published by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 in his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; based on plate 100 in volume two of Catesby&#x27;s &quot;Natural history of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;.

The American bullfrog, &quot;Lithobates catesbeianus&quot;, is named in honor of Catesby.

Catesby is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of New World snakes: &quot;Dipsas catesbyi&quot; and &quot;Uromacer catesbyi&quot;.

<text>Laure Sainclair (; born 24 April 1972) is a French former adult film actress.

Sainclair first worked as a model for nude photography. She eventually met pornographic actresses at an adult entertainment convention in Rennes, and decided to try her hand at the sex industry. She worked for a time as a stripper, then made her first adult film in 1995, a semi-amateur production titled &quot;Maud s&#x27;offre à toi&quot;. Her first experience was a negative one but she eventually met producer Marc Dorcel who made her his first contract performer. and &quot;brand ambassador&quot;. Sainclair went on to be the most popular adult film actress in France during the second half of the 1990s.

She won several awards in Europe and also made a small number of films in the U.S. She received Hot d&#x27;Or Awards for Best European Starlet in 1996 and for Best European Actress in 1997 and 1998 (for &quot;Les Nuits de la Présidente&quot; – Video Marc Dorcel).

In 1999, after her contract with Dorcel ended, she left the sex industry, and later entirely disavowed her adult film career. She tried to reinvent herself as a singer, but without success. In 2012, she sued her former music producer, who had also been her life partner, for rape and domestic abuse.

<text>Ardnamurchan (, ) is a peninsula in the ward management area of Lochaber, Highland, Scotland, noted for being very unspoiled and undisturbed. Its remoteness is accentuated by the main access route being a single track road for much of its length. The most westerly point of mainland Great Britain, Corrachadh Mòr, is in Ardnamurchan.

From 1930 to 1975 Ardnamurchan also gave its name to a landward district of Argyll, which covered a much wider area, including the districts of Morvern, Sunart and Ardgour.

==Geography==

Strictly speaking, Ardnamurchan covers only the peninsula beyond the villages of Salen (in the south) and Acharacle (in the north), but nowadays the term is also used more generally to include the neighbouring districts of Sunart, Ardgour, Morvern, and even Moidart (which was part of the former county of Inverness-shire, not Argyll).
Ardnamurchan Point, which has the Ardnamurchan Lighthouse built on it, is commonly described as the most westerly point of the British mainland although Corrachadh Mòr, a kilometre to the south, is a few metres farther west.

==Geology==

The north western corner of Ardnamurchan consists of a lopolith (previously interpreted as a ring dyke) that has been exposed at the surface. Evidence for such a structure can be identified from the phenocrysts in the rock exposures around the area of interest which show plagioclase crystals aligned towards the centre of the complex, an alignment caused by magmatic flow within a lopolith. Relatively small areas of lava that were ejected onto the surface are found in some parts of the peninsula, close to the inner edges of the area of interest. The sub-concentric rings of the geologic structure can easily be seen in satellite photographs and on topographic maps, though they are less obvious on the ground. At least seven other similar complexes of the same tectonic episode exist along the west coast of Britain, and these are popular sites for many university geological training courses.

==History==

Adomnan of Iona records St Columba visiting the peninsula in the 6th century, and gives the impression that it was settled by Irish Gaels at that time. He records three instances of signs performed by Columba on the peninsula.

Adomnan records in one instance that Columba prophesied to his companions the death of Kings Báetán mac Muirchertaig and Eochaid mac Domnaill before news arrived the same day at a place called &#x27;paradise bay&#x27; to tell them the news. In the second instance, which is said to have occurred in an unnamed rocky spot in the interior, the parents of a boy brought their child to Columba to be baptized but no water could be found, and Columba prayed to God and water miraculously came out of a nearby rock and he prophesied that the child would live a sinful life and later be a saint.

In the third instance, which took place at a spot Adomnan called &#x27;Sharp bay&#x27;, there was a wicked man named Ioan mac Conaill maic Domnaill who was related to the Cenél nGabraín, and this man attacked Columba&#x27;s friend and plundered his goods. Columba met this wicked man and called on him to repent, but he didn&#x27;t listen and instead boarded his boat with the stolen goods. Columba then followed the boat, wading into the water up to his knees and prayed to God. He then prophesied to his companions that this man and his boat were going to meet with disaster on the sea, and according to Adomnan, the boat was sunk before reaching land with Ioan drowning at sea along with his stolen goods.
Donaldson identifies &quot;Buarblaig&quot; (now referred to as Bourblaige, about east of Kilchoan on the other side of Ben Hiant, ) with Muribulg, where the Annals of Tigernach record a battle between the Picts and the Dalriads in 731. It may also be the &#x27;Muirbole Paradisi&#x27; mentioned by Adomnán. Although its stone foundations still remain, the village of Bourblaige no longer exists, as it was destroyed in the Highland Clearances in the early 19th century.

According to early twentieth-century tradition in Ardnamurchan, two battles were fought in the bays between Gortenfern () and Sgeir a&#x27; Chaolais (). Archaeological finds in the vicinity of Cul na Croise ()—a bay between Sgeir a Chaolais and Sgeir nam Meann—consist of spears, daggers, arrow-heads, and a coin dating to the reign of Edward I, King of England. These artefacts could indicate that Cul na Croise was the site of conflict fought in the context of the strife between Edward I&#x27;s representative, Alasdair Óg Mac Domhnaill, and the Clann Ruaidhrí brothers, Lachlann Mac Ruaidhrí and Ruaidhrí Mac Ruaidhrí. According to tradition, one of the battles fought in the area concerned a certain &quot;Red Rover&quot;, and another fought nearby concerned an Irishman named &quot;Duing&quot; or &quot;Dewing&quot;. Relics of a Viking ship burial in Cul na Croise have been given to the West Highland Museum at Fort William.

In 2011, a Viking ship burial, probably from the 10th century, was unearthed at Port an Eilean Mhòir on Ardnamurchan. Grave goods buried alongside a Viking warrior found in the boat suggest he was a high-ranking warrior. The Ardnamurchan Viking was found buried with an axe, a sword with a decorated hilt, a spear, a shield boss and a bronze ring pin. Other finds in the grave in Ardnamurchan included a knife, what could be the tip of a bronze drinking horn, a whetstone from Norway, a ring pin from Ireland and Viking Age pottery.

==Settlements==
The population of the whole peninsula is around 2,000. Historically part of the former county of Argyll, it is now part of the Lochaber ward management area of the Highland local authority.

Villages in Ardnamurchan: 
* Acharacle () 
* Achnaha ()
* Glenborrodale ()
* Kilchoan ()
* Kilmory ()
* Laga ()
* Ockle ()
* Portuairk ()
* Salen ()
* Sanna ()

==Scottish Gaelic==

Ardnamurchan has one of the highest concentrations of Scottish Gaelic speakers on the mainland, with 19.3% of the local population able to speak the language. The peninsula is also home to an annual Mòd, an eisteddfod-like festival and series of contests celebrating the Gaelic language, its culture, music, and literature.

Ardnamurchan has also been the home to a number of important figures in Scottish Gaelic literature.

Prior to his involvement in the Jacobite rising of 1745, the legendary Gaelic poet Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair worked as schoolmaster for the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge in Kilchoan, where his father had previously served as Rector for the Jacobite and High Church Non-Juring Anglican Communion.

Dr John MacLachlan, the author of , a poem on the Ardnamurchan Clearances, is unusual for his outspoken criticism of the Anglo-Scottish landlords responsible for the evictions. The poem influenced Somhairle MacGill-Eain, who wrote a poem to its author.

==Economy==

Ardnamurchan distillery is a Scotch whisky distillery located on the peninsula.

==Culture==
The peninsula has its own shinty team, Ardnamurchan Camanachd.

==Fauna and scenery==

Rare species such as the wildcat, pine marten, golden eagle and white-tailed eagle can be seen in Ardnamurchan.

Ardnamurchan is wild and unspoiled. Ardnamurchan Point, adjacent to the most westerly point on the British mainland, has a lighthouse and a view from a sheer rock face of the open Atlantic Ocean. The northern part of Ardnamurchan forms part of the Morar, Moidart and Ardnamurchan National Scenic Area, one of 40 such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure their protection by restricting certain forms of development.

==Famous people==

*The geologist Donald Duff FRSE (1927–98) bought a house there after surveying the area in the 1950s.
*The button box accordion player, Fergie MacDonald, is from the area.
*The preacher J. Douglas MacMillan came from Ardnamurchan.
*The cameraman, CBeebies presenter and &quot;Strictly&quot; contestant Hamza Yassin has lived in the area for 12 years

<text>October Revolution Island (Russian: остров Октябрьской Революции, &quot;ostrov Oktyabrskoy Revolyutsii&quot;) is the largest island of the Severnaya Zemlya group in the Russia in the Arctic. It is named after the October Revolution which overthrew the Russian Empire and created the communist Soviet Union in its place.

The area of this island has been estimated at making it the 59th largest island in the world. It rises to a height of on Mount Karpinsky. Half the island is covered with glaciers reaching down into the sea. In the sections free from ice, the vegetation is desert or tundra.

==Geography==
October Revolution Island houses five domed ice caps; clockwise from north, they are named: Rusanov, Karpinsky, University, Vavilov and Albanov. The Rusanov and Karpinsky ice caps, located on the eastern side of the island, feed with glaciers the Matusevich Fjord of the Laptev Sea and the Marat Fjord of the Shokalsky Strait. The Karpinsky ice cap reaches a maximum height of 963 m and it is also the highest point in Severnaya Zemlya.

In 2015 the Vavilov Glacier accelerated dramatically due to warming. Between 2015 and 2016 the glacier front advanced 4 km and the glacier lost 4.5 km3 of ice.

Other minor ice caps on the island include the Malyutka Glacier. The Podemnaya River and the Bolshaya River drain to the northwest between the Vavilov and Albanov glaciers, and the Bedovaya and Obryvistaya Rivers drain to the north between the Albanov and Rusanov ice caps.

The coast of the island is uneven with rugged coves and headlands. The largest bays of the island are along the northern coast. The Red Army Strait separates October Revolution Island from Komsomolets Island to the north and from Pioneer Island in the northwest, while the broader Shokalsky Strait separates it from Bolshevik Island to the south. Both straits connect the Kara Sea in the west with the Laptev Sea in the east. Cape October is located in the northern part of the island facing the Red Army Strait.

==Paleontology==
Fossilized scales of thelodonts have been discovered on this island. &quot;Stroinolepis maenniki&quot; is described by material from the Middle and Upper Ordovician deposits of the Strojnaya River, after which it was named. &quot;Loganellia grossi&quot;, &quot;Paralogania consimilis&quot;, &quot;Thelodus calvus&quot; and &quot;Shielia multispinata&quot; were found in the younger Wenlock deposits of the Silurian. Conodonts were also collected from October Revolution Island. &quot;Aphelognathus&quot; sp. is dated to the Middle-Upper Ordovician, while &quot;Panderodus&quot; and &quot;Ozarkodina&quot; were discovered in Rhuddanian, Lower Silurian period.

==History==
The island was discovered by Boris Vilkitsky in 1913 during an expedition on behalf of the Russian Hydrographic Service, but its insularity was not proven until 1931, when Georgy Ushakov and Nikolay Urvantsev charted the archipelago during their 1930–1932 expedition.

The Vavilov Meteorological Station was operated from 1974 to 1988 on the northern part of the Vavilov Ice Cap.

The island had a nuclear-powered lighthouse installed in 1989, shortly after the closing of the weather station.

<doc id="524094" wikidata="Q944346" url="?curid=524094" title="Schmidt Island">
<text>Schmidt Island () is one of the islands of the Severnaya Zemlya group in the Russian Arctic. It was named after Soviet scientist and first head of the Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route, Otto Schmidt. Located at the far northwestern end of Severnaya Zemlya, it lies slightly south of the Arctic Cape on Komsomolets Island. There is no tourism on the island except for scientists, military personnel, and a few explorers.

==Geography==
Schmidt Island is significantly detached from the rest of Severnaya Zemlya regarding the relative proximity of the other main islands to each other.

It measures and is almost entirely covered by the Schmidt Ice Cap. Owing to its exposed position, the climate in the Schmidt Island&#x27;s area is much colder than in the rest of the archipelago.

<text>The Fusiliers Museum of Northumberland, formerly the Northumberland Fusiliers Museum, is a museum located within the Abbot&#x27;s Tower of Alnwick Castle in Alnwick, Northumberland, England.

==History==
The museum was first established at Fenham Barracks in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1929 but moved to Alnwick Castle in 1970.

==Collection==
The museum displays the history of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers and its predecessor regiments from 1674 to current times. It is an independent registered charity. It also displays artifacts such as the nameplate from the steam locomotive &quot;Private E Sykes VC&quot; which commemorated the soldier who had been awarded the Victoria Cross while serving with the regiment.

The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers was created in 1968 after the amalgamation of four Regiments. Thus the museum is part of a family of other Fusilier museums: the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers Museum (Royal Warwickshire) in Warwick, the Fusilier Museum (Lancashire) in Bury and the Fusiliers Museum (London) at the Tower of London.

==Victoria Crosses held by the museum==
The museum holds the Victoria Crosses awarded to the following members of the regiment:
*Sergeant Robert Grant 5th Regiment of Foot (Indian Rebellion)
*Second Lieutenant James Johnson 2nd Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (First World War)
*Private Patrick McHale 5th Regiment of Foot (Indian Rebellion)
*Sergeant Peter McManus 5th Regiment of Foot (Indian Rebellion)
*Private Ernest Sykes 27th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (First World War)

<doc id="524098" wikidata="Q1508258" url="?curid=524098" title="George Simpson, Baron Simpson of Dunkeld">
<text>George Simpson, Baron Simpson of Dunkeld (born Dundee, 2 July 1942) is a British businessman and former Labour - and later unaffiliated - member of the House of Lords. In the late 1980s and early 1990s Simpson gained a reputation for turning around struggling companies. However, as CEO of Marconi plc he presided over one of the largest collapses in British corporate history.

== Career ==
Simpson joined The Rover Group from its subsidiary Leyland-DAF in 1988 and took over as managing director in January 1989. Simpson reorganised the company, replacing the three boards of Austin Rover, Land Rover and the Rover Group with one single board. By this time Rover had been privatised and sold to British Aerospace (BAe) and by early 1990 Simpson had been appointed to the BAe board. In September 1991 Simpson also assumed the role of Rover chairman when the previous chairman, Sir Graham Day, was appointed as BAe&#x27;s interim chairman. Day promoted Simpson to deputy chief executive of British Aerospace in December 1991 to &quot;toughen up&quot; the company&#x27;s management. He remained executive chairman of Rover but was replaced as managing director.

In November 1993 he was announced as CEO of Lucas Industries, which under his leadership was merged with US company Varity, which subsequently led to the company being split up and sold off . At this time Simpson was admired for his role in turning the struggling Rover business around. Before he assumed his Lucas role he was part of the sale of Rover to BMW. He had been part of negotiations which would have seen Honda increase their 20% share in Rover to 47.5% with the aim for a stock market flotation. However BMW offered £800 million for the Rover Group which would free BAe from Rover&#x27;s &quot;quite large appetite for cash&quot;, average daily debt of £200 million and £700 million of other commitments. Simpson travelled to Japan to ask if Honda could match the offer, which they refused to do.

On 18 March 1996 Simpson was confirmed as managing director of GEC as replacement to Lord Weinstock. In reporting the appointment &quot;The Independent&quot; said, &quot;Some analysts believe that Mr Simpson&#x27;s inside knowledge of BAe, a long-rumoured GEC bid target, was a key to his appointment. GEC favours forging a national &#x27;champion&#x27; defence group with BAe to compete with the giant US organisations.&quot; In 1999 he sold GEC&#x27;s defence business, Marconi Electronic Systems, to BAe for £7.7 billion and repositioned the company as a major player in the telecommunications industry as Marconi plc.

Marconi borrowed heavily to finance expansion into this market and was especially vulnerable to the burst of the dot-com bubble. After a &quot;botched&quot; profits warning in July 2001 Simpson&#x27;s deputy chief executive, John Mayo, resigned. A second profits warning in September 2001 saw Simpson and chairman Sir Roger Hurn resign.

The effect of this collapse was felt long after Simpson&#x27;s resignation. Despite a major restructuring the company continued to struggle until 2005 when the loss of a major BT contract forced the company to seek a buyer. Marconi was purchased by Ericsson in 2005: several businesses not acquired by Ericsson formed Telent plc.

He was created a Life peer as Baron Simpson of Dunkeld, of Dunkeld in Perth and Kinross on 5 November 1997. Having been on leave of absence from the House of Lords since 2004, he resigned from the House on 30 July 2015.

===Print journalism===
Hume worked first for &quot;The Hartford Times&quot; newspaper company, and later for United Press International and the newspaper &quot;Baltimore Evening Sun&quot;. He then worked for syndicated columnist Jack Anderson from 1970 to 1972.

In 1971, Grossman Publishers published Hume&#x27;s first book, &quot;Death and the mines: Rebellion and murder in the United Mine Workers&quot;, a work revolving around complicity of the U.S. Bureau of Mines, coal companies, and the United Mine Workers union resulting in the mistreatment of average miners.

Hume reported a story for Anderson&#x27;s column &quot;Washington Merry-Go-Round&quot; that after ITT Corporation had contributed $400,000 to the 1972 Republican National Convention, President Richard Nixon&#x27;s Department of Justice settled the antitrust case against ITT. Anderson published a series of classified documents indicating the Nixon administration, contrary to its public pronouncements, had favored Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. After the revelations, Anderson and his staff, including Hume and his family, were briefly surveilled by the Central Intelligence Agency in 1972. The agents observed his family going about its daily business. The documents were revealed during President Gerald Ford&#x27;s administration by congressional hearings and as a result of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit and the so-called &#x27;Family Jewels&#x27; revelations.

In 1973, Hume became Washington editor of &quot;MORE&quot; magazine, a press criticism journal, and in 1974 Doubleday published his second book, &quot;Inside Story&quot;.

===1973-1996: ABC News===
In 1973, Hume started working for ABC News as a consultant, and in 1976, he was offered a job as a correspondent, covering the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate for 11 years. In 1979, Hume earned television&#x27;s first Academy Award nomination for his work on &quot;The Killing Ground&quot; for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Close-Up&quot; documentary program.

Hume was assigned to report on Walter Mondale&#x27;s 1984 presidential campaign, and George H. W. Bush&#x27;s 1988 presidential campaign. In 1989, he became ABC&#x27;s chief White House correspondent, covering the administrations of Presidents Bush and Bill Clinton and working closely with ABC anchors Peter Jennings and Charlie Gibson.

===1996-present: Fox News===

In 1996, Hume left ABC for the Fox News Network for which his wife had recently become chief of the Washington bureau. At his last news conference as ABC&#x27;s chief White House correspondent, President Clinton told him, &quot;I think all of us think you have done an extraordinary, professional job under Republican and Democratic administrations alike.&quot; Hume became Fox News&#x27;s Washington managing editor.

====&quot;Special Report w/ Brit Hume&quot; (1998–2008)====

After he began at Fox News, Hume was in discussions about starting a Washington-based television news program for the 6 p.m. timeslot. The Lewinsky scandal began during January 1998, and Hume&#x27;s wife told him the story was so well known that he should start the show immediately. &quot;Special Report with Brit Hume&quot; debuted that evening in that timeslot.

Hume said of the start of his time at Fox that &quot;we made some progress and developed some audience and the Lewinsky scandal brought a lot of interest and the 2000 election brought a lot of interest, but what really did it was the Florida recount – that was tremendous for us because the people who were worried about how that would come out wanted some place where they could trust the coverage, people who were conservatives or Republicans or neither but worried. And we really made an effort to cover that story well. And that built our audience.&quot;

The show was the number one cable news program in the 6:00 p.m. Eastern timeslot for several years.

In July 2008, it was announced that Hume would retire as anchor of &quot;Special Report&quot; at the end of the year, but he would remain on Fox News in a different role. On December 23, 2008, he hosted his final episode as anchor of &quot;Special Report&quot;, announcing that Bret Baier, then the chief White House correspondent for Fox News, would be his replacement. Hume also announced that he would remain with Fox News as a senior political analyst and regular panelist for the program &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot;.

On January 3, 2010, Hume on &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot;, advised embattled golfer Tiger Woods to convert to Christianity to attempt to end his problems. Hume&#x27;s comments were made after the revelation of Woods&#x27; habitual adultery and the resulting deterioration of his relationship with his family.

====&quot;On the Record&quot; (2016)====
On September 6, 2016, Hume was named the anchor of &quot;On the Record&quot; after that show&#x27;s longtime anchor, Greta Van Susteren, abruptly left Fox News. He served as the program&#x27;s anchor through the end of the 2016 elections. Hume&#x27;s first show as host of &quot;On the Record&quot; drew 2.4 million viewers, a double-digit increase over Van Susteren&#x27;s average viewing audience in 2016. On November 4, 2016, it was announced that Tucker Carlson would host a new show in the former &quot;On the Record&quot; timeslot from November 14, 2016.

=== 2020 U.S. presidential election ===
In late May 2020, Hume criticized presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden for wearing a face mask during the coronavirus pandemic while suggesting that it was positive for President Donald Trump to not wear one. In September 2020, Hume claimed that Biden was &quot;senile&quot;.

Hume joined Chris Wallace, Juan Williams, and Dana Perino in Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum&#x27;s election night coverage of the 2020 United States Presidential election on Fox News.

==Personal life==
Hume is a conservative, remarking in 2006: &quot;Sure, I&#x27;m a conservative, no doubt about it. But I would ask people to look at the work.&quot;

Hume is divorced from his first wife, Clare Jacobs Stoner. Their son, Sandy Hume, was a reporter for the newspaper &quot;The Hill&quot; and first publicized the story of the failed 1997 political attempt to replace Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. In February 1998, Sandy Hume died by suicide. The National Press Club honors his memory with its annual Sandy Hume Memorial Award for Excellence in Political Journalism. Hume was baptized and confirmed in the Episcopal Church and has said that he committed his life to Jesus Christ &quot;in a way that was very meaningful&quot; to him in the aftermath of his son&#x27;s suicide in 1998.

Brit Hume&#x27;s daughter, Virginia Hume (born 1965), was a contributor to &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;. She worked for 25 years as a public relations, political communications and traditional marketing professional. Her political experience includes serving as a deputy press secretary for the Republican National Committee in 1996.

In 1993, Hume married Kim Schiller, who was a Fox News vice president and Washington bureau chief before she retired in 2006.

<doc id="524102" wikidata="Q2053647" url="?curid=524102" title="Parliament of Southern Ireland">
<text>The Parliament of Southern Ireland was a Home Rule legislature established by the British Government during the Irish War of Independence under the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It was designed to legislate for Southern Ireland, a political entity which was created by the British Government to solve the issue of rising Irish nationalism and the issue of partitionism, while retaining the whole of Ireland as part of the United Kingdom.

The parliament was bicameral, consisting of a House of Commons (the lower house) with 128 seats and a Senate (the upper house) with 64 seats. The parliament as two houses sat only once, in the Royal College of Science for Ireland in Merrion Street. Due to the low turnout of members attending, the parliament was adjourned and was later officially disbanded by the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922.

==History==
Under the Act of Union 1800 the separate Kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain were merged on 1 January 1801, to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Throughout the 19th century Irish opposition to the Union was strong, occasionally erupting in violent insurrection.

In the 1870s the Home Rule League under Isaac Butt sought to achieve a modest form of self-government, known as Home Rule. This was considered more acceptable by British parliamentarians as Ireland would still remain part of the United Kingdom but would have limited self-government. The cause was then pursued by Charles Stewart Parnell and two attempts were made by Liberal ministries under British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone to enact home rule bills, accompanied by a revival of Ulster&#x27;s Orange Order to resist any form of Home Rule. The First Home Rule Bill was defeated in the Commons by 30 votes; the second Second Home Rule Bill was passed, but then defeated in the Lords.
On 11 April 1912, the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, introduced the Third Home Rule Bill which allowed for more autonomy than its two predecessors had. It was defeated twice, but after its defeat for the third time in the Lords the Government used the provisions of the Parliament Act 1911 to override the Lords and send it for Royal Assent, which was received and the bill placed on the statute books on 18 September 1914. However, with the outbreak of the First World War, it was decided that the bill&#x27;s implementation should be suspended, leading to the passing of the Suspensory Act 1914, which was presented for Royal Assent simultaneously with both the Home Rule Bill and the Welsh Church Act 1914, and ensured that Home Rule would be postponed for the duration of the conflict and would not come into operation until the end of the war. Initially the suspension was not considered an issue by Nationalists, who believed a form of independent self-government had finally been granted. Moreover, like almost everyone else in Europe at that time, Irish nationalists expected the war to be a short one.

Two attempts were made by the Asquith coalition ministry and the Lloyd George ministry to implement the Government of Ireland Act 1914 during the war, first in May 1916, which failed to reach agreement with Unionist Ulster, then again in 1917 with the calling of the Irish Convention chaired by Horace Plunkett. It consisted of Nationalist and Unionist representatives who, by April 1918, only succeeded in agreeing a report with an &#x27;understanding&#x27; on recommendations for the establishment of self-government. Starting in September 1919, with the Government, now led by David Lloyd George, committed under all circumstances to implementing Home Rule, the British cabinet&#x27;s Committee for Ireland, under the chairmanship of former Ulster Unionist Party leader Walter Long, pushed for a radical new idea. Long proposed the creation of two Irish home rule entities, Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, each with unicameral parliaments. An amendment to the bill in the House of Lords submitted by Lord Oranmore and Browne added a Senate for Southern Ireland, intended to bolster representation of the southern Unionist and Protestant minorities. The government opposed this on the grounds that it would weaken the function of the inter-parliament Council of Ireland, but it was passed, as was an amendment adding a Senate of Northern Ireland.

After the 1918 general election, those elected as MPs for Sinn Féin met in Dublin in 1919 and established Dáil Éireann as an abstentionist parliament and declared independence for the Irish Republic.

==House of Commons==

The House of Commons consisted of 128 members who were styled as members of parliament with a presiding officer known as the Speaker of the House of Commons. The basic features of the House were modelled on those of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The franchise was the same as for Westminster elections under the Representation of the People Act 1918: men over 21 and women over 30. The voting method for elections to the Commons was the single transferable vote with the act prescribing 16 members being elected from multi-member borough constituencies, 104 from multi-member county constituencies and 8 being elected from graduates of Irish Universities. The borough and county constituencies replaced those used for Westminster elections with new multi-member ones. The university constituencies were broken down into four seats for Dublin University and four for the National University.

===Election===

On 24 May 1921, elections were held for the House of Commons of Southern Ireland, the same day as the elections for Northern Ireland. No contests occurred as all 128 MPs were returned unopposed, with Sinn Féin winning all 124 seats which made up the borough and county constituencies and the seats allocated to the National University of Ireland, and Unionists the four seats for graduates of Dublin University. Dáil Éireann chose to regard that election as elections to the Second Dáil. The 124 Sinn Féin candidates elected, plus the six Sinn Féin members elected to the House of Commons of Northern Ireland elected at the same time (five of whom also had seats in Southern Ireland), assembled as the Second Dáil.

===June 1921 meeting===
On 28 June 1921, the House of Commons and the Senate formally assembled in the Royal College of Science for Ireland, now Government Buildings, in Merrion Street, for a State Opening by Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent, the last Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Only the four Unionist MPs attended the Commons. After electing Gerald Fitzgibbon to be Speaker, the House adjourned . This was the only formal meeting of the House.

===January 1922 Treaty ratification meeting===

The Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed in London on 6 December 1921 by representatives of the British Government and envoys of the Irish Republic who claimed plenipotentiary status. On 7 January 1922, Dáil Éireann ratified the Treaty. However, in accordance with its terms, the Anglo-Irish Treaty needed also to be ratified &quot;at a meeting of members of the Parliament elected for constituencies in Southern Ireland&quot; and the British Parliament.

A meeting in the Mansion House was convened on 14 January 1922 by Arthur Griffith as Chairman of the Irish Delegation of Plenipotentiaries (who had signed the Anglo-Irish Treaty) of &quot;members of the Parliament elected for constituencies in Southern Ireland&quot;. Griffith&#x27;s actions led to discussions between the Irish Treaty delegation and the British Government over who had authority to convene the &#x27;meeting&#x27; as under the Government of Ireland Act 1920 the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (then Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent) was the office-holder with the entitlement and power to convene a meeting of the House of Commons of Southern Ireland. The meeting was attended by 64 pro-Treaty Sinn Féin TDs and four Unionist MPs from the University of Dublin; it elected Alderman Liam de Róiste, one of the representatives of Cork Borough, as chairman (although at this time Eoin MacNeill was Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann), duly ratified the Treaty and nominated Michael Collins for appointment as Chairman of the Provisional Government. Collins was installed in his post by the Lord Lieutenant in Dublin Castle on 16 January 1922 and formed the Provisional Government of Ireland. The members at this meeting did not take the British Oath of Allegiance, which was required by MPs in the House of Commons.

==Senate==

The Senate of Southern Ireland was the upper house of the Parliament of Southern Ireland established by the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The Senate convened in 1921 but was boycotted by Irish nationalists. Fifteen members attended its first meeting, and it sat only three times.

===Composition===
The Fourth Home Rule Bill provided for a Senate of 64 members. The composition was specified in the Second Schedule, and the mode and time of selection in the Fourth Schedule. The bill stipulated that the membership be composed of:
* 3 members:
** The Lord Chancellor of Ireland, intended as the presiding officer of the Senate. The Lord Chancellor had previously been the chairman of the Irish House of Lords in the Parliament of Ireland prior to its abolition.
** The Lord Mayor of Dublin and the Lord Mayor of Cork.
* 17 &quot;Representatives of Commerce (including Banking), Labour, and the Scientific and Learned Professions&quot; to be nominated by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland for a term of 10 years.
* 44 members elected by various interest groups from among their respective memberships, using the single transferable vote for 10-year terms, except for county councillors.
** 4 Archbishops or Bishops of the Catholic Church holding Sees situated wholly or partly in Southern Ireland.
** 2 Archbishops or Bishops of the Church of Ireland holding Sees situated wholly or partly in Southern Ireland.
** 16 Peers (not necessarily members of the Peerage of Ireland) who were taxpayers or ratepayers in respect of property and had residences in Southern Ireland.
** 8 Members of His Majesty&#x27;s Privy Council in Ireland of no less than two years standing who were taxpayers or ratepayers in respect of property in and had residences in Southern Ireland.
** 14 Representatives of county councils, for a term of three years, with:
*** 4 from each of Leinster, Munster, and Connaught
*** 2 from the three Ulster counties not in Northern Ireland (Cavan, Donegal, and Monaghan)

In practice, however, only forty senators were selected, as the labour movement, the Catholic Church and the county councils (controlled by Sinn Féin) refused to co-operate. Of those elected, many had participated in the Irish Convention of 1917–18. Of the incomplete membership, not all attended its few sessions. Some were subsequently members of the Free State Seanad (upper house), either appointed by W. T. Cosgrave, President of the Executive Council, or elected by the members of the Dáil (lower house).

Donal O&#x27;Callaghan was Lord Mayor of Cork throughout the existence of the Senate, but was also returned for Cork Borough in the 1921 election to the House of Commons of Southern Ireland. Section 18(4) of the 1920 Act precluded anyone from sitting in both Houses at once; but since O&#x27;Callaghan boycotted both, the question was moot in his case.

===Meetings===
The Senate assembled three times, though its chairman, Sir John Ross, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, was too ill to attend. Only 15 senators attended its first meeting. Since 124 of the 128 members of the House of Commons of Southern Ireland boycotted that chamber, the Parliament could not function. On 21 June 1921, the week before its first meeting, the Senate sent a petition to David Lloyd George, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, arguing for more powers for the Parliament, and stating it would not serve in the event that the elected lower house was replaced by a body appointed by the Lord Lieutenant.

==Abolition==
The Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922 was passed on 31 March 1922 by the British Parliament. It gave the force of law to the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which was scheduled to the Act. Section 1(2) of the Act provided that for the purposes of giving effect to Article 17 of the Treaty the Parliament of Southern Ireland would be dissolved within four months from the passing of the Act. The Parliament of Southern Ireland ceased to exist on 27 May 1922, when Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, formally dissolved it and by proclamation called &quot;a Parliament to be known as and styled the Provisional Parliament&quot;. An election to this Provisional Parliament was held on 16 June 1922. On 6 December 1922, the Constitution of the Irish Free State came into force and Southern Ireland ceased to form part of the United Kingdom. The Oireachtas of the Irish Free State was a bicameral parliament consisting of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.

<text>Bombardier () is a military rank that has existed since the 16th century in artillery regiments of various armies, such as in the British Army and the Prussian Army. Traditionally the bombardier tended the vents at the top of breeches, handled the final assembly of ammunition and placed the ammunition in the muzzles for the gunners to fire. It is today equivalent to the rank of corporal in other branches. The rank of lance bombardier is the artillery counterpart of lance corporal.
== Commonwealth armies ==
Bombardier (Bdr) and lance bombardier (LBdr or L/Bdr) are used by the British Army in the Royal Artillery and Royal Horse Artillery. The same applies to the Royal Australian Artillery, the Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery, the South African Army Artillery Formation and the Armed Forces of Malta. The Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery uses the ranks of master bombardier and bombardier, corresponding to master corporal and corporal.

Originally, the Royal Artillery had corporals, but not lance corporals. Unlike a lance corporal, a bombardier, who was junior to a corporal, held full non-commissioned rank and not an acting appointment. The rank was equivalent to second corporal in the Royal Engineers and Army Ordnance Corps.

In 1920 corporals were abolished in the Royal Artillery; bombardiers became the equivalent and acquired the normal two chevrons.

The rank of lance bombardier originated as acting bombardier, an appointment similar to lance corporal and also indicated by a single chevron. The appointment was renamed lance bombardier in February 1918. It became a full rank, along with lance corporal, in 1961.

<text>The Dawes Plan temporarily resolved the issue of the reparations that Germany owed to the Allies of World War I. Enacted in 1924, it ended the crisis in European diplomacy that occurred after French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr in response to Germany&#x27;s failure to meet its reparations obligations.

The Plan set up a staggered schedule for Germany&#x27;s payment of war reparations, provided for a large loan to stabilise the German currency and ended the occupation of the Ruhr. It resulted in a brief period of economic recovery in the second half of the 1920s, although it came at the price of a heavy reliance on foreign capital. The Dawes Plan was superseded by the Young Plan in 1929.

Because the Plan resolved a serious international crisis, the American Charles G. Dawes, who headed the group that developed it, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1925.

== Background ==
At the end of World War I, the Allied Powers included in the Treaty of Versailles a plan for the reparations for which Germany would be liable. It established an interim 20 billion Reichsmarks to be paid through April 1920 and left the full details to be determined by an Inter-Allied Reparation Commission. In April 1921, the Allies adopted the London Schedule of Payments that the Commission had developed. It established the total German reparations figure at 132 billion gold marks (US $442 billion in 2023 dollars). The schedule was separated into three classes, of which only the first two, amounting to 50 billion gold marks, were expected to be paid.

On 5 May 1921 the Allies delivered an ultimatum to Germany demanding that it accept the London Schedule within six days and threatening to occupy the heavily industrialized Ruhr district if it did not. The Reichstag voted to accept on 11 May, following which the government began to implement its fulfilment policy (), an effort to show the impossibility of meeting the payments by attempting to fulfil them. Germany made its first payment of one billion gold marks in the summer of 1921 but after that paid little in cash and fell behind in its deliveries of materials such as coal and timber. After Germany was declared in default in January 1923, French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr. Germany responded with passive resistance to the occupation. The government printed money in order to pay the idled workers, which fuelled the hyperinflation that all but wrecked the German economy.

Ensuing events led the Allies to decide that the London Schedule needed to be re-examined. The Ruhr occupation had heightened tension between France and Germany. The acceptance of the London Schedule by Germany&#x27;s government increased political instability. Chancellor Joseph Wirth&#x27;s fulfilment policy angered many on the right, who called it traitorous. Radical right-wing groups instigated a hate campaign against representatives of the Republic that included the assassination in August 1921 of Matthias Erzberger, one of the signers of the Armistice of 11 November 1918, and in June 1922 of Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau. The United States feared a coup from either the right or the left and that if one did take place, the large amount of money it had loaned to France and England during the war – the repayment of which was in large part dependent on the receipt of German reparations – might never be recovered.
===Dawes committee===

In 1923 the new German chancellor Gustav Stresemann ordered an end to passive resistance, implemented a currency reform that brought an end to the hyperinflation and sought discussions with the Allied Powers which would take into consideration what Germany was financially capable of paying. The Reparations Commission set up the Dawes committee, consisting of ten expert representatives nominated by their respective countries: two each from Belgium (Baron Maurice Houtart, Emile Francqui), France (Jean Parmentier, Edgard Allix), Britain (Sir Josiah C. Stamp, Sir Robert M. Kindersley), Italy (Alberto Pirelli, Federico Flora) and the United States (Charles G. Dawes and Owen D. Young). Dawes, the head of the committee, was a former army general, banker and politician. His committee was tasked with examining the stabilization of Germany&#x27;s currency, its budget and its resources. Based on the studies, the committee was to recommend a realistic schedule of payments – one taking into account Germany&#x27;s ability to pay – that would replace the London Schedule.

==The Plan==

The Dawes Report stressed in its introduction that &quot;the guarantees we propose are economic and not political in nature&quot;. The resulting Dawes Plan covered payment amounts and timing, sources of revenue, loans to Germany, currency stabilization and ending the Ruhr occupation:
* Reparations payments began at one billion Reichsmarks the first year, increasing annually to two and a half billion after five years. No total sum was set. The terms included a prosperity index, based on which Germany would have to pay more under favourable economic circumstances.
* The sources for reparation payments included taxes on customs duties, alcohol, tobacco and sugar, and revenue from railroads and the budget. As a guarantee for payments, the German National Railway was converted into a corporation under creditor-state supervision. An interest-bearing mortgage on German industry for 5 billion Reichsmarks also served as a guarantee.
* The Reichsbank was reorganized under the supervision of the creditor states. It had seven representatives from the creditor states and seven Germans on its board and was independent of the central government.
* Germany was loaned 800 million Reichsmarks to be the base capital of the central bank and to ensure the Reichsmark’s stability. About half of the sum was raised through Wall Street bond issues in the United States.
* The Allied Reparations Commission was replaced by a Transfer Committee which was to take the value of the Reichsmark into consideration when making payment transfers. Payments were not to be made if they endangered the gold that backed the Reichsmark. Repayment of commercial debts took priority over reparations payments in order to maintain Germany&#x27;s creditworthiness.
* Foreign troops were to be withdrawn from the Ruhr.
== Reichstag approval ==
The debate over the Dawes Plan in the Reichstag affected the formation of a new government following the May 1924 Reichstag election. The Communist Party of Germany (KPD) saw the Dawes Plan as economic imperialism, and the Nazi Party objected altogether to paying reparations. Many on the political right objected to it because of the limits it placed on German sovereignty (control of the Reichsbank and the national railroad). The right-wing nationalist German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP) had campaigned against the Dawes Plan and gained 24 additional seats, making it the second strongest party in the Reichstag after the Social Democrats. The party&#x27;s refusal to change its stance on the Dawes Plan resulted in Chancellor Wilhelm Marx of the Centre Party remaining in office presiding over a centrist minority cabinet. Since the clause in the Dawes Plan regarding the German National Railway required a change in the Weimar Constitution and therefore a two-thirds majority in the Reichstag to pass, it was necessary for some DNVP members to vote for acceptance. A number of influential industrial and agricultural interest groups urged the DNVP to accept the Plan, with the result that it passed on 29 August 1924 with the help of 48 DNVP votes. The Dawes Plan formally went into effect on 1 September 1924.

== Results ==

The influx of foreign credit led to the upswing in the German economy that underpinned the &quot;Golden Twenties&quot; of 1924–1929. Overall economic production increased 50% in five years, unemployment fell sharply and Germany&#x27;s 34% share of world trade was higher than it had been in 1913, the last full year before the outbreak of World War I. By the start of the world economic crisis in 1929, Germany had received 29 billion Reichsmarks in loans. In spite of the stronger economy, Germany was unable to achieve the trade surpluses necessary to finance reparations. It met almost all of its payments under the Dawes plan but could do so only on the basis of its large foreign debt. Most loans were short term, which meant that they could be quickly called in if the creditor nation experienced an economic downturn. Germany found itself heavily reliant on foreign capital.

The occupation of the Ruhr ended on 25 August 1925.

Germany considered the Dawes Plan to be a temporary measure and expected a revised solution in the future. In 1928 German Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann, the former chancellor, called for a final plan to be established, and the Young Plan was enacted in 1929.

Dawes, who was the U.S. vice president at the time, received the Nobel Peace Prize of 1925 for &quot;his crucial role in bringing about the Dawes Plan&quot;, specifically for the way it reduced the state of tension between France and Germany resulting from Germany&#x27;s missed reparations payments and France&#x27;s occupation of the Ruhr. British foreign minister Austen Chamberlain shared the prize with Dawes, although his award was for the Locarno Treaties, which dealt with post-war territorial settlements.
