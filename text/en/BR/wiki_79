<text>Reeves and Mortimer, colloquially known as Vic and Bob, are a British double act consisting of Vic Reeves (born 24 January 1959; real name Jim Moir) and Bob Mortimer (born 23 May 1959). They have written and starred in several comedy programmes on British television since 1990, with Reeves having made his first TV appearance in 1986. They have often been referred to as a modern-day Morecambe and Wise.

Reeves and Mortimer&#x27;s comedy combines absurd, visually and verbally inventive material with traditional comedy double-act staples such as violent, cartoonish slapstick (the duo frequently engage in escalating fights with large frying pans, baseball bats, hammers, etc.), often improvised silly banter (usually at a large, prop-strewn desk) and purposefully corny, rapid-fire jokes. Both at times play the straight man: often Mortimer will play the exasperated foil to Reeves&#x27; eccentric buffoon, or Reeves will play blankly bemused or annoyed to a manic or hyperactive Mortimer.

They forged a status for themselves as &quot;the alternatives to alternative comedy&quot; in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In a 2005 poll, &quot;The Comedian&#x27;s Comedian&quot;, the duo were voted the 9th-greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.

==Career as a double-act==
They have performed on a number of television programmes as a double act, and have also worked alone or in collaboration with other people. (For their work outside of the Reeves &amp; Mortimer double act, see Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer.)

===Early years===
Jim Moir&#x27;s comedy career began in New Cross, London, in the mid-1980s. Having tried out various stage names, he settled on &quot;Vic Reeves&quot; and began a show called &quot;Vic Reeves&#x27; Big Night Out&quot;, first at Winston&#x27;s Wine Bar in Deptford, then at The Goldsmiths Tavern. At Goldsmith&#x27;s he met and began working with Bob Mortimer, and the show then moved to an even bigger venue, the Albany Theatre in Deptford, in 1989. The show began to attract various well-known audience members, such as Jonathan Ross and Alan Yentob and collaborators such as Charlie Higson and Paul Whitehouse.

Few recordings of early &quot;Big Night Out&quot; live shows exist, though a video was made available to members of the original fan club in the mid-1990s, containing material and characters very similar to those that made it to the later TV show.

===Television===
Jonathan Ross played a large part in Reeves&#x27; first TV appearances, which included Reeves hanging suspended from the ceiling during an episode of &quot;The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross&quot; (1988). His company, Channel X, brought &quot;Vic Reeves Big Night Out&quot; to Channel 4 as a six-part series in 1990. The show quickly attained a cult following. A New Year&#x27;s Eve special bridging 1990/91 followed (in which Kim Wilde made an appearance). This was followed by a second eight-part series in 1991.

In addition to Reeves and Mortimer, the other mainstay of the programme was Les (played by Fred Aylward), Vic&#x27;s bald, lab-coat-clad assistant who never spoke, loved spirit levels and had a fear of chives. Other established characters in the TV series included The Man With The Stick, who wore a paper helmet (daubed with drawings of what he had witnessed during the last week) and carried a stick with a mystery item attached to the end; Graham Lister, Reeves&#x27; nemesis who regularly entered the talent show Novelty Island with a series of dreadful acts; Donald and Davey Stott, two brothers from the North-East with high-pitched voices, who would recreate popular television game shows; Tinker&#x27;s Rucksack, a pair of ramblers, one of whom was conducting an affair with the other&#x27;s wife; and Judge Lionel Nutmeg, a judge who presided over the &quot;That&#x27;s Justice&quot; segment of the show.

====Sketch shows====
In 1993, Reeves and Mortimer transferred from Channel 4 to BBC Two (after filming a pilot music show called Popadoodledandy), writing and appearing in &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot;, indicating the rise in Mortimer&#x27;s standing from sidekick to Reeves&#x27; equal.
The programmes were more slick and scripted than their Channel 4 predecessors. Two series of six episodes each were made, and most of the original &quot;Big Night Out&quot; format was abandoned, although various actors returned in new roles, including Caroline Aherne, Charlie Higson (&quot;The Fast Show&quot;) and Matt Lucas (&quot;Little Britain&quot;). The live stage show that followed the TV series hosted a welcome return for Novelty Island (a sketch from the original &quot;Big Night Out&quot;).
In 1993, the pair also recorded &quot;Reeves and Mortimer&#x27;s Driving School&quot;, a one-off comedy show featuring, amongst others, Pat Wright and Dave Arrowsmith, the Bra Men characters from &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot;.

In 1997, they co-wrote a one-off special, &quot;It&#x27;s Ulrika!&quot; for &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; panellist, Ulrika Jonsson. The show aired on BBC1, and featured appearances from Vic and Bob, as well as Matt Lucas, David Walliams and Charlie Higson.

A new sketch show followed in 1999, &quot;Bang Bang, It&#x27;s Reeves and Mortimer&quot;. Characters Donald and Davey Stott (who had appeared throughout the &quot;Big Night Out&quot; era) returned to the screen. The series also featured various celebrity cameos, including Caprice, Michael Winner, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and Damon Hill, and appearances from comedy actors Charlie Higson and Morwenna Banks.

Higson and Banks also appeared, together with Matt Lucas, Reece Shearsmith, Mark Benton and others, in the surreal 6-part BBC Three comedy series &quot;Catterick&quot; (2004), sometimes listed as &quot;Vic and Bob in Catterick&quot;.

In 2004, in collaboration with Steve Coogan, Reeves and Mortimer produced &quot;The All Star Comedy Show&quot;, a two-part special for ITV. The programme featured Mortimer, Reeves, Coogan, Morwenna Banks, Matt Lucas, Reece Shearsmith and Mark Benton, plus a wide array of further guests including Fiona Allen, Ronni Ancona, Leslie Ash, Lynda Bellingham, Ronnie Corbett, Tim Healy, Jane Horrocks, Neil Morrissey, Griff Rhys Jones, John Simm, Meera Syal, Ricky Tomlinson and Richard Wilson.
In 2005, a full series was commissioned and was given the new name, &quot;Monkey Trousers&quot;. The series retained most of the same characters, and featured several guests in common with &quot;The All Star Comedy Show&quot;, plus some new faces including Mackenzie Crook, Iain Lee, John Thomson and Alistair McGowan. A one-off, &quot;Big Night Out&quot;, primarily to promote the DVD release of &quot;Vic Reeves Big Night Out&quot;, was held in September 2005.

The pair also recorded &quot;Star Chamber&quot;, a pilot program for BBC Two. The program was a debate show chaired by Mortimer, and featured Reeves, Charlie Higson, Johnny Vegas, Liz Smith and Rhys Thomas. The program has yet to be commissioned.

A one-off special called &quot;Vic and Bob&#x27;s Big Night Out&quot; was shown on BBC Two in December 2017. This was a partial revival of the original &quot;Vic Reeves Big Night Out&quot; format, and featured an appearance by Matt Lucas. Two four-part series followed in 2018 and 2019 on BBC Four.

====Quiz shows====
In 1993 a pilot episode of &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; was screened on BBC Two as part of the &quot;At Home with Vic and Bob&quot; evening of programming. It began running as a regular series in 1995. Maintaining their bizarre and irreverent style, the pair played host to two teams of celebrity guests (captained each week by Mark Lamarr and Ulrika Jonsson, and later Will Self, and further Jack Dee) answering what can be loosely described as general knowledge questions. They were also accompanied by regular appearances from Lucas as drumming baby George Dawes. The quiz element of the show always played second fiddle to the comedic aspects.

Two series of Reeves and Mortimer&#x27;s second quiz followed in 1999. Entitled &quot;Families at War&quot;, it featured two families competing in bizarre tasks on a loose &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; theme. The show was far more mainstream, less comedy-based, and obviously designed for comfortable Saturday evening BBC1 viewing.

When asked, in November 2007, about bringing back former shows, Reeves also expressed his opinion that a second series of &quot;Catterick&quot; was highly unlikely. However, he said he would be very happy to bring back &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; for a sixth series. On 27 February 2008, whilst on a tour of the North East region to support the Learning and Skills Council&#x27;s Apprenticeship Week, he added &quot;We might be doing &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; again – it depends on the BBC&quot;.

In July 2008, the BBC confirmed that they had commissioned a one-off Christmas Special of &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; along with an additional &quot;best-of&quot; episode featuring interviews and outtakes, to mark the show&#x27;s 15 year anniversary. Also confirmed were the return of Reeves, Mortimer and Matt Lucas (as George Dawes), and that the special would be produced by Pett Productions, Reeves and Mortimer&#x27;s own production company. It was filmed at BBC Television Centre in London on 28 November 2008, and broadcast on BBC Two on 30 December 2008, along with the anniversary programme. Ulrika Jonsson returned as captain of Team B, with Jack Dee appearing as the new captain of Team A. Dizzee Rascal, Kate Garraway, Christine Walkden and Dragons&#x27; Den&#x27;s Peter Jones were the guests.

This Christmas Special spawned the third incarnation of &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;, which included a sixth series in 2009, a seventh series in 2010 and another Christmas special airing on 30 December 2010. An eighth series of the show was shown on BBC 2 in 2011. The show has since been axed by the BBC.

Shortly after the axing of &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; by the BBC, Reeves and Mortimer produced a one-off quiz show for Channel 4 in 2012, &quot;Lucky Sexy Winners&quot;. The new show followed a very similar format to &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; except that there were no teams, only three celebrities competing individually. Dan Skinner, who portrayed the character Angelos Epithemiou on &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;, brought a new character, John Meringue, to &quot;Lucky Sexy Winners&quot;.

====Sitcom and drama====
In 1992, Reeves and Mortimer made their first brief detour into sitcoms by writing and recording a pilot episode of &quot;The Weekenders&quot;, a one-off pilot for Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Bunch of Five&quot; season. The Human League vocalist Phil Oakey, and the future Fast Show trio of Paul Whitehouse, John Thomson and Simon Day, all co-starred. &quot;The Weekenders&quot; is also notable as the one programme where Vic is intentionally referred to throughout by his real name, Jim. Intended to be a series, the programme was never commissioned, but now seems to be a vague sign of things to come.

In early 2000, Vic and Bob headed the cast in revival of sixties private detective drama, &quot;Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot;. The new version, &quot;Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot; ran for two series and constituted their first dramatic (though still light-hearted) acting roles. The scripts for the series were written by Charlie Higson and Reeves was briefly romantically linked to co-star Emilia Fox. The pair also presented a one-off behind the scenes show called &quot;On Set with Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot;, which was broadcast on BBC Choice in 2000.

Their 2004 comedy drama &quot;Catterick&quot;, screened on BBC Three, evoked the same unreal atmosphere with a far higher budget. The series was based around the lives of Carl and Chris Palmer, with appearances from D.I. &#x27;Kinky&#x27; John Fowler and updated versions of characters from &quot;The Club&quot; sketches from &quot;Bang Bang It&#x27;s Reeves and Mortimer&quot;. Vic and Bob played the main roles, with Charlie Higson, Morwenna Banks, Tim Healy, Mark Benton, Matt Lucas and &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;&#x27;s Reece Shearsmith.

On 27 February 2008, Reeves announced that he and Mortimer were working together on a new series, as well as possibly reviving &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;:
In 2014, they co-wrote and starred in &quot;House of Fools&quot; on BBC Two. The series also stars Matt Berry.

====Web series====
In July 2011, Reeves and Mortimer&#x27;s first web series, &quot;Vic and Bob&#x27;s Afternoon Delights&quot;, was hosted on Fosters&#x27; UK website. A new episode was added each weekday from 4 to 29 July, with each of the 20 episodes consisting of a single sketch.

===Radio===
In 1994, between series of &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot;, the pair hosted a one-off hour long show on BBC Radio 1 entitled &quot;Radio Reeves &amp; Mortimer&quot;. The show was partially presented in character as &#x27;co-hosts&#x27; Councillors Cox and Evans.

In November 2007, BBC Radio 2 aired a weekly radio-based sketch show featuring Reeves and Mortimer, entitled &quot;Vic Reeves&#x27; House Arrest&quot;. The first episode was broadcast on 17 November 2007 and the series ran for 6 episodes. The show centred on Reeves being put under house arrest for a crime he didn&#x27;t commit. Mortimer played Reeves&#x27; hairdresser, Carl. Other performers include &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; star Noel Fielding as a local vagrant and Reeves&#x27; wife, Nancy Sorrell in multiple roles.

In an interview on British TV show &quot;Something for the Weekend&quot; Reeves stated there were benefits to doing a radio show, as even more bizarre and outlandish images could be conjured, which could not be replicated using props on a television programme - such as balancing the whole of Ireland on a record stylus to stop it from skipping.
However he also said that he would be interested in making the radio show into a television series.

===Film===
Reeves and Mortimer auditioned for roles as a pair of chipmunks in &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994); according to Mortimer, the Disney producers were enthusiastic, but he and Reeves were uncomfortable with their corporate attitude and abandoned the film.

In August 2003, Reeves and Mortimer appeared in &quot;Once Upon a Time in the Midlands&quot; as Plonko the Clown and Kung-Fu Clown. In 2004, they appeared in &quot;&quot; as Bendle and Potter. As of 2018, they were producing &quot;The Glove&quot; alongside regular collaborators such as Matt Berry and Morgana Robinson. In November 2022 it was revealed that actor Brian Cox had joined the cast of The Glove.

===Music===
Reeves and Mortimer first appeared on Jools Holland&#x27;s single &quot;Holy Cow&quot; in 1990, singing backing vocals.

The following year, Reeves collaborated with The Wonder Stuff to cover &quot;Dizzy&quot;, originally released in 1969 by Tommy Roe. The song reached number one and spawned a spin-off full-length album on Island Records, &quot;I Will Cure You&quot;, which featured re-recorded songs from &quot;Big Night Out&quot;, cover versions and new material. A companion video titled &quot;Four Golden Memories&quot; was released, which featured videos for &quot;Dizzy&quot; and Reeves&#x27;s other singles &quot;Born Free&quot; and &quot;Abide With Me&quot;, plus live versions of &quot;Dizzy&quot; (filmed on tour the previous year) and &quot;Meals on Wheels&quot;.

The pair collaborated with EMF to cover The Monkees&#x27; sixties classic &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot; in 1995. The cover reached number three in the British charts, and also appeared in a trailer for the movie, &quot;Shrek&quot;. Their cover was also referenced in the movie&#x27;s version sung by Eddie Murphy at the end.

==Advertising==
In the 1990s and 2000s both Reeves and Mortimer capitalised on their fame by featuring in a variety of television adverts. The earliest of these was for Cadbury&#x27;s Boost bars, described by Reeves as &quot;slightly rippled with a flat underside&quot;. Other companies they advertised together included Müller, where the duo acted out examples of pleasure and pain, MFI and Kit-e-Kat. They have advertised several products solo such as Mini Cheddars and DHL (Mortimer) and Heinz Tomato Ketchup, Fanta, Lynx and Mars chocolate bars (Reeves). Mortimer contends that derivative material of their comedy and works has &quot;flooded the advertising world. The Tango and McDonald&#x27;s ads wouldn&#x27;t have been on without our sort of stuff.&quot;

Reeves and Mortimer appeared in a corporate advert for the BBC itself in the early 1990s, suggesting that the BBC was a place where talent could grow and develop. The advert spoofed BBC trailers of the time, which informed viewers of upcoming programmes due for broadcast. The duo&#x27;s advert replaced these real programmes with their own inventions, including crime-drama &quot;Detective in a Wheelbarrow&quot;, a comedy pastiche of &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; called &quot;Three Blokes in a Bath&quot; (which also featured Matt Lucas), coverage of both &quot;Olympic Anvil Throwing&quot; and &quot;International Pan Fighting&quot;, and ended with &quot;&quot;Poldark&quot; on Mopeds&quot;.

Perhaps the most significant advert starring the pair was the finale of the Renault Clio Papa &amp; Nicole advert series in 1998. Renault cast the duo to battle over Nicole, the star of the series, at the altar. An estimated 23 million viewers tuned in to see Nicole jilting Reeves at the altar and eloping with Mortimer in a Clio, spoofing a scene from the 1967 film The Graduate. For extra exposure, the commercial was scheduled for prime time viewing during the long-standing British soap opera Coronation Street. It was also screened extensively during the World Cup. The duo&#x27;s &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot; characters Le Corbussier et Papin quoted the advert in their sketches before they were cast in the role.

Also in 1998, the pair voiced adverts for Churchill Insurance. Mortimer provided the voice of the adverts&#x27; signature nodding dog, Churchill, and Reeves was the consumer, prompting the dog to extol the virtues of insurance deals offered by the company. Reeves&#x27; contract with Churchill was terminated in 2005 after he was arrested for a drink-driving offence which disqualified him from driving for 36 months and ordered 100 hours of community service. Mortimer continued to provide the voice for the dog until at least 2009.

==Production==
In 2001, Reeves, Mortimer and Lisa Clark formed their own production company, Pett Productions, which has produced several television programmes that have featured one or both comedians.

== Awards ==
In 2015, Vic and Bob received the Aardman Slapstick Visual Comedy Award for their significant contributions to the world of visual comedy.

<text>James Roderick Moir (born 24 January 1959), commonly known by his stage name Vic Reeves, is an English comedian and artist. He has a double act with Bob Mortimer as Reeves &amp; Mortimer. He is known for his surreal sense of humour.

In 2003, Reeves and Mortimer were listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. In a 2005 poll to find the &quot;Comedians&#x27; Comedian&quot;, Reeves and Mortimer were voted the ninth-greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.

==Early life==
Moir was born in Leeds, the son of Audrey (née Leigh) and James Neill Moir (1926–2004). At the age of five, he moved to Darlington, County Durham, with his parents and younger sister Lois. He attended Heathfield Infants and Junior School and went on to the nearby secondary school, Eastbourne Comprehensive in Darlington. After leaving school, Moir undertook an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering at a factory in Newton Aycliffe. Eventually he moved to London, where he attended the Polytechnic of North London and Middlesex Polytechnic.

==Early career==
Moir formed the Fashionable Five, a group of five friends (including Jack Dent, who ran the original Fan Club) who would follow bands like the Enid and Free onto stage, and perform pranks (including Moir pretending to have a brass hand, and following a Terry Scott lookalike around Darlington town centre in single-file formation). Moir had an early breakthrough with the help of comedian Malcolm Hardee.

Before finding fame with his comedy, Moir was a member of several bands with many different names and musical styles, in which he usually played lead guitar and/or sang. He sold tapes of his early material in the back pages of &quot;NME&quot; magazine under the name International Cod. Mark Lamarr, later to become a team captain on &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;, was sent a tape of Moir&#x27;s band Fan Tan Tiddly Span. When Moir appeared, as Vic Reeves, on &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; in 1998, Lamarr repeatedly played a sample from the song &quot;Fantasia (Side A)&quot; in an attempt to embarrass him.

In 1983, Moir began a part-time course at a local art college, developed his love of painting and eventually persuaded a local art gallery to stage an exhibition of his work. His drawings and paintings have been used in his television shows and form a major part of his 1999 book, &quot;Sun Boiled Onions&quot;.

==As Vic Reeves==
===Television and radio===

As well as working and performing in bands in London, including being an original member of the Industrial/Experimental band Test Dept and performing onstage with them at their debut gig (then leaving soon afterwards), Moir also joined the alternative comedy circuit under many different guises. These included a loudmouthed American called Jim Bell, a beat poet called Mister Mystery and eventually, &quot;The North-East&#x27;s Top Light Entertainer&quot;- Vic Reeves, whose name is derived from two of his favourite singers, Vic Damone and Jim Reeves. His stage show &quot;Vic Reeves Big Night Out&quot; began life as a regular Thursday night gig at Goldsmiths Tavern, New Cross (now the New Cross House). Here, he met Bob Mortimer, a solicitor who attended the show and enjoyed it so much that he soon began to participate.

Moir&#x27;s television début came in December 1986 on Channel 4 Television&#x27;s &quot;The Tube&quot; in a comedy game show segment called &quot;Square Celebrities&quot;, suspended by a wire to ask the &quot;celebrities&quot; questions. His next appearance was on the short-lived chat/comedy show &quot;One Hour with Jonathan Ross&quot; in a game show segment known as &quot;Knock Down Ginger&quot;. Reeves&#x27; growing TV profile led to &quot;Big Night Out&quot; being given a slot on Channel 4 the following year. It was about this time that Reeves and Bob Mortimer rented a back room at Jools Holland&#x27;s office/recording studio in Westcombe Park, Greenwich where they would spend hours writing material.

Moir continued to work alongside Mortimer as a comedy duo in a series of 1990s programmes, &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot;, &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;, and &quot;Bang, Bang, It&#x27;s Reeves and Mortimer&quot;, some of which also featured future cast members of &quot;The Fast Show&quot; and &quot;Little Britain&quot;. A 1994 pilot written by Paul Whitehouse and Charlie Higson entitled &quot;The Honeymoon&#x27;s Over&quot; was due to feature Chris Bell, a character from &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot;; however, the series was never commissioned. The same year, Reeves made a guest appearance on the Radio 1 series &quot;Shuttleworth&#x27;s Showtime&quot;, hosted by John Shuttleworth. Between August 1998 and May 1999, Reeves and Mortimer presented the Channel X produced BBC Saturday game show &quot;Families at War&quot; with Alice Beer.

Moir played Marty Hopkirk in the BBC&#x27;s 2000–2001 thriller series &quot;Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot;, a revival of the original 1960s series, with Mortimer as Randall, Emilia Fox as Jeannie Hopkirk, and Tom Baker as Wyvern. In 2000, Moir presented a series entitled &quot;Vic Reeves Examines&quot; on UK Play, featuring celebrities such as Ricky Gervais, Johnny Vegas, Lauren Laverne and Emma Kennedy discussing a topic of their choice. The same year, Moir presented a one-off radio show on BBC Radio 1, entitled &quot;Cock of the Wood&quot;.

He appeared as a celebrity guest alongside his wife Nancy Sorrell on Living TV&#x27;s &quot;Most Haunted&quot; in 2003, investigating famous Belgrave Hall with the crew.

In 2004 Moir and his wife, Nancy Sorrell were both contestants in the fourth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. He also appeared in the series &quot;Catterick&quot; with Mortimer appearing as several characters. In September 2005, Moir hosted a show for Virgin Radio called &quot;Vic Reeves Big Night In&quot; produced by Mark Augustyn, for a short period on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 7.00pm.

Moir presented a historical ten-part series, entitled &quot;Rogues Gallery&quot;, which was shown on the Discovery Channel (UK) in 2005, where he investigated, and portrayed Anne Bonny and Mary Read, Captain Kidd, Claude Duval, Jonathan Wild, Rob Roy, Colonel Blood, George Ransley, Deacon Brodie, Blackbeard and Dick Turpin. Sorrell also appeared in some episodes. Continuing in this vein, &quot;Vic Reeves&#x27; Pirates&quot; was shown on ITV West and, subsequently, on the History Channel in 2007. In May 2006, Moir presented a programme on ITV Tyne Tees about Northeast comedy culture called &quot;It&#x27;s Funny Up North with... Vic Reeves&quot;.

In 2007, Moir hosted a show called &quot;Vic Reeves Investigates: Jack the Ripper&quot;. Moir, with the help of historians and leading experts, tried to discover who Jack the Ripper was. At the end of the show, he came to the conclusion that Jack the Ripper was Francis Tumblety. On 8 May 2007, Moir was the main presenter of &quot;&quot; during the fifth and sixth series, replacing Richard Hammond. Beginning in June 2007, Reeves presented a BBC Radio 2 panel game called &quot;Does the Team Think?&quot;. On 17 November 2007, Moir appeared in a weekly sketch show on BBC Radio 2, entitled &quot;Vic Reeves&#x27; House Arrest&quot;. The show&#x27;s premise was that Reeves had been put under house arrest for &quot;a crime he didn&#x27;t commit&quot;, and each episode consists of the various events that take place in and around his house on a particular day. Mortimer plays his housecall-making hairdresser, Carl, while other performers include &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; star Noel Fielding as a local vagrant who comes to Reeves&#x27; door on a weekly basis looking for work, as well as Nancy Sorrell in multiple roles.

On 27 February 2008, Moir announced that he and Mortimer were working together on a new sitcom about superheroes who get their powers through a malfunctioning telegraph pole. He also reiterated his desire to bring back &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; for a 6th series. Along with his son, Moir is also featured in one edition of a factual series for Five, &quot;Dangerous Adventures for Boys&quot;, based on the best-selling book written by Conn and Hal Iggulden, &quot;The Dangerous Book for Boys&quot;.

In February 2009, Moir appeared as presenter of the first episode of &quot;My Brilliant Britain&quot;, one of the new television shows commissioned for UKTV People channel&#x27;s relaunch as Blighty. On 25 August 2009, Moir appeared as a guest on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot; with Mortimer. Series 6 of &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; began airing on 26 August 2009 with Reeves and Mortimer, along with Ulrika Jonsson and Jack Dee as team captains. Moir appeared as one of the guests in &quot;Reece Shearsmith&#x27;s Haunted House&quot;, a light-hearted radio discussion show broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in two parts on either side of Halloween on 29 October 2009 and 5 November 2009.

In July 2011, Reeves and Mortimer released a selection of YouTube improvised comedy sketches, in association with Foster&#x27;s. They released their &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; clips every weekday afternoon in July.

In 2020, Moir co-hosted the Netflix original, reality series &quot;The Big Flower Fight&quot; alongside Natasia Demetriou.

====Advertising====
Moir has appeared in television advertisements, both with Mortimer and alone. He has done solo advertising work for a variety of products including Guinness, MFI, Müller Light, First Direct, Mars Bar, Fanta, Heinz Tomato Ketchup, Domestos bleach, Maryland Cookies, 888 Ladies and East Coast Trains. Moir also advertised Jools Holland&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Moving Out to the Country&quot;. With Mortimer, he advertised Cadburys Boost and Churchill Insurance. Mortimer voiced the nodding bulldog, Churchill, and in early adverts, Moir&#x27;s voice would ask questions about car insurance, to which Churchill replied with his catchphrase, &quot;Oh, yes!&quot; However, in 2005 Moir was dropped from the adverts after being arrested on charges of drunk-driving.

===Music===
As part of early &quot;Big Night Out&quot; performances, Reeves would sometimes hand out promotional materials to the audience. On one occasion he handed out a 7&quot; flexi disc of original song &quot;The Howlin&#x27; Wind&quot;. Having surplus copies of the discs, Moir passed them on to Darlington-based band Dan, who then included a copy of the disc with their album &quot;Kicking Ass at T.J.&#x27;s&quot;.

====Album====
&quot;I Will Cure You&quot; is Moir&#x27;s only album, recorded under the name Vic Reeves. It was released in 1991 by Island Records and peaked at No. 16 on the UK Albums Chart. It features the number one single &quot;Dizzy&quot; which was a collaboration with the Wonder Stuff. It includes a mixture of covers and original songs in a variety of musical styles, many of which were originally introduced in &quot;Big Night Out&quot;. Along with &quot;Dizzy&quot;, two other singles were released from the album, a cover of the Matt Monro song &quot;Born Free&quot; and a dance reworking of the Christian hymn &quot;Abide with Me&quot; which reached No. 6 and No. 47 on the UK Singles Chart, respectively.

====Singles====
In 1995, Reeves and Mortimer released a cover of the Monkees song &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot; with British band EMF which reached No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart. Moir had a history with the track, having both sung it at the beginning of early &quot;Big Night Out&quot; performances in London, and opened the Channel 4 series with it. In the music video, which was directed by Moir, the duo dress as Mike Nesmith and Davy Jones of the Monkees. On the CD release of the single, a studio version of &quot;At This Stage I Couldn&#x27;t Say&quot; is included, a track originally sung by characters Mulligan and O&#x27;Hare in &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot;. On the 7&quot; release, the bonus track is &quot;At Least We&#x27;ve Got Our Guitars&quot;, which was the opening song for the last episode of &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot;.

In April 2007, the theme to British stop-motion animation &quot;Shaun the Sheep&quot;, sung by Moir, was released as a single. The song reached No. 20 on the UK Singles Chart.

====Contributions====
In 1990, both Reeves and Mortimer contributed backing vocals to Jools Holland&#x27;s &quot;Holy Cow&quot; (a Lee Dorsey cover). The track was included on Holland&#x27;s album &quot;World of his Own&quot; and released as a single. Later, Moir would advertise Holland&#x27;s album &quot;Moving Out to the Country&quot;.

Also in 1990, Moir provided backing vocals for former Smiths singer Morrissey&#x27;s cover of &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot;, originally by the Jam. Moir&#x27;s vocals were not used in the final edit but he was thanked (as Jim Moir) in the sleeve notes of Morrissey&#x27;s &quot;Sing Your Life&quot; single, which featured &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; as a bonus track. A fan of the Smiths, Moir opened some episodes of &quot;Big Night Out&quot; with covers of the band&#x27;s songs including &quot;Sheila Take a Bow&quot; which he intended to include a cover of on his album &quot;I Will Cure You&quot;. It did not make the final cut.

In 1992, Moir contributed a track to &quot;Ruby Trax&quot;, a compilation album released by &quot;NME&quot; magazine to commemorate 40 years of the publication. He covered the Ultravox song &quot;Vienna&quot;, but drastically altered the original lyrics.

In 1998, Moir contributed to &quot;Twentieth-Century Blues: The Songs of Noël Coward&quot;, a tribute album featuring notable singers and bands such as Elton John, Sting, Robbie Williams and Paul McCartney. Moir covered Coward&#x27;s 1934 track &quot;Don&#x27;t Put Your Daughter on the Stage Mrs. Worthington&quot;, which was arranged by David Arnold for the album. The song, described by Moir as &quot;sinister&quot;, was initially recorded with all original verses intact, but as the last included foul language, it was edited out of the final release.

In 2000, Moir&#x27;s cover of &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Kick in the Head?&quot; was featured as a bonus track on the theme single to the &quot;Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot; series in which he starred. Moir was originally to duet with Nina Persson (of the Cardigans), who provided vocals, but missed the final cut. A shortened version of Moir&#x27;s cover also featured in the series itself. Moir appeared in the music video for the single along with Bob Mortimer.

====Music videos====
Other than the music videos for his own singles, Moir has appeared in others. His first was the 1987 video for Shakin&#x27; Stevens&#x27; single &quot;What Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me For&quot;. He was hired for the shoot and paid £10 for his appearance.

Moir also appeared in the 1988 music video for Band of Holy Joy&#x27;s song &quot;Tactless&quot;. He introduces the band and can be seen at the bar part way through. The video was filmed in Deptford, London and original advertising posters for &quot;Big Night Out&quot; can be seen at the beginning.

==Art==
Moir has produced art both under the name Jim Moir and Vic Reeves. This reflects that his art, while serious, also combines with his comedy. Moir works in many media including painting, ceramics, photography and lino prints. His work has been described as Dada-esque, surreal and sometimes macabre. For Moir, his art and comedy are different ways of expressing the same idea. He says &quot;I think putting your imagination on canvas or a television screen is the same thing&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t differentiate between painting, acting or comedy. I think everything I do is art.&quot; Moir has stated that he is an artist first and a comedian second, and that in ten years time he would like to be remembered for his art and writing, rather than his comedy.

Moir has said that art should be &quot;just for laughs&quot; and that he dislikes people looking for statements in his work, because there are none. &quot;If something makes me laugh, that&#x27;s it.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve done straight drawings and paintings ... and I haven&#x27;t got as much pleasure out of them as if I&#x27;d done something that would make me laugh.&quot; His work has been described by artists Jake and Dinos Chapman as &quot;able to command our laughter as a purgative, to encourage the viewer to leak at both ends&quot;. Artist Damien Hirst, a friend, has also described Moir&#x27;s work as Reeves as an influence. This crossover of comedy and art often features within Reeves and Mortimer&#x27;s television shows. A notable example is &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot; first episode. Several of Moir&#x27;s drawings are featured, illustrating the lyrics of the opening song. (These drawings would later be published within his book &quot;Sun Boiled Onions&quot;.) As seen in the script book for the show, Moir often drew sketches for the BBC&#x27;s costume and set designers saying that &quot;if we just tell them what we want, it never ends up looking like it does in our minds&quot;.

===Background and education===
Arts and crafts played a large part in Moir&#x27;s upbringing. His mother and father, a seamstress and typesetter by trade, made extra money by selling handmade wooden crafts and ceramics at local markets. Building on these money-making schemes, Moir began charging for his own artistic services such as customising and painting his school friend&#x27;s Haversack bags and elaborately embroidering clothing. Later he would go on to forge artworks his acquaintances liked with the aim of selling them to them. Wanting to study art, but being pressured into work, Moir began a five-year engineering apprenticeship at a factory in Newton Aycliffe with the aim of working in their technical drawings department.

After completing the apprenticeship, Moir applied to Goldsmiths College in London to study art, but failed to get a place. He has admitted to sneaking in and using their equipment regardless. In 1983 he completed a one-year foundation course at Sir John Cass College, where he is now an honorary graduate. Once leaving college, he worked as a curator at The Garden Gallery, an independent London gallery. It was there that he held his first art exhibition in 1985, with the help of a grant from Lewisham Council.

===Published work and exhibitions===
As Vic Reeves, he has released two books of his art, &quot;Sun Boiled Onions&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Vic Reeves&#x27; Vast Book of World Knowledge&quot; in 2009. His drawings also appear in his autobiography &quot;Me:Moir Volume One&quot;, and the published script book for &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot;. He provided thirty illustrations for Random House&#x27;s 2011 reprint of Jerome K. Jerome&#x27;s classic story &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;. He was also commissioned to create several celebrity drawings for Jools Holland&#x27;s Channel 5 series &quot;Name That Tune&quot;.

Moir has hosted several exhibitions of his artwork, including:
*&quot;Sun Boiled Onions&quot; (2000) at the Percy Miller Gallery
*&quot;Doings&quot; (2002) at the Whitechapel Gallery, London
*&quot;My Family and Other Freaks&quot; (2007) at the Eyestorm Gallery, London
*&quot;Where Eagles Tremble&quot; (2009) at Mews of Mayfair, London
*&quot;Hot Valve Leak: Visual Ramblings of Vic Reeves&quot; (2013) at the Strand Gallery, London
*&quot;Romans, Daisies, Ones and Twos&quot; (2022) at Northampton Museum and Art Gallery, Northampton

In 2010, a selection of Moir&#x27;s paintings were displayed at the Saatchi Gallery, London as part of an exhibition by charity The Art of Giving. He was also a judge for the charity&#x27;s open art competition.

In 2012, Moir took part in the Illuminating York festival. His illuminations, known as &quot;Wonderland&quot;, were projected across a number of historic buildings including the Yorkshire Museum, St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, and the ten-acre site of York Museum Gardens.

<text>Abraham Fraenkel (; 17 February, 1891 – 15 October, 1965) was a German-born Israeli mathematician. He was an early Zionist and the first Dean of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is known for his contributions to axiomatic set theory, especially his additions to Ernst Zermelo&#x27;s axioms, which resulted in the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.

==Biography==
Abraham Adolf Halevi Fraenkel studied mathematics at the Universities of Munich, Berlin, Marburg and Breslau. After graduating, he lectured at the University of Marburg from 1916, and was promoted to professor in 1922.

In 1919, he married Wilhelmina Malka A. Prins (1892–1983). Due to the severe housing shortage in post-First World war Germany, for a few years the couple lived with fellow professor Kurt Hensel as subtenants.

After leaving Marburg in 1928, Fraenkel taught at the University of Kiel for a year. He then made the choice of accepting a position at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which had been founded four years earlier, where he spent the rest of his career. He became the first dean of the faculty of mathematics, and for a while served as rector of the university.

Fraenkel was a fervent Zionist and as such was a member of Jewish National Council and the Jewish Assembly of Representatives under the British mandate. He also belonged to the Mizrachi religious wing of Zionism, which promoted Jewish religious education and schools, and which advocated giving the Chief Rabbinate authority over marriage and divorce.

==Mathematician==
Fraenkel&#x27;s early work was on Kurt Hensel&#x27;s p-adic numbers and on the theory of rings. He is best known for his work on axiomatic set theory, publishing his first major work on the topic &quot;Einleitung in die Mengenlehre&quot; (Introduction to set theory) in 1919. In 1922 and 1925, he published two papers that sought to improve Zermelo&#x27;s axiomatic system; the result is the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms. Fraenkel worked in set theory and foundational mathematics.

Fraenkel was also interested in the history of mathematics, writing in 1920 and 1930 about Gauss&#x27;s works in algebra, and he published a biography of Georg Cantor. After retiring from the Hebrew University and being succeeded by his former student Abraham Robinson, Fraenkel continued teaching at the Bar Ilan University in Ramat Gan (near Tel Aviv).

==Awards==
* In 1956, Fraenkel was awarded the Israel Prize, for exact sciences.

<text>Robert Renwick Mortimer (born 23 May 1959) is an English comedian, author, television presenter, writer and actor. He is best known for his work with Vic Reeves as the comedy double act Reeves and Mortimer, and more recently the &quot;Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing&quot; series with Paul Whitehouse. He has appeared on TV panel shows such as &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; and &quot;Taskmaster&quot;.

== Early life ==
Robert Renwick Mortimer was born in Middlesbrough on 23 May 1959, and grew up with three brothers in the town&#x27;s Linthorpe area. His father, a biscuit salesman, died in a car crash when Mortimer was seven. At around the same time, Mortimer accidentally burnt down his family&#x27;s home with a stray firework. He attended King&#x27;s Manor School in Middlesbrough, where his schoolmates included future sports presenter Ali Brownlee. A keen football fan, he had trials for local club Middlesbrough F.C., but abandoned his footballing dreams due to early-onset arthritis.

Mortimer left school with three A-Levels and went on to study law at the University of Sussex and University of Leicester. There, he became a punk, and started a band called Dog Dirt. After leaving university with an LLM in Welfare Law, he moved to London and became a solicitor for Southwark Council. He then moved to a private practice in Peckham, where his work with Public Health Act cases regarding cockroach infestations of council properties led to a local paper, the &quot;South London Press&quot;, dubbing him &quot;The Cockroach King&quot;. According to his autobiography, he was mugged during this time by one of his clients, who stopped and apologised after recognising him; he continued to represent the client.

== Career ==
=== Partnership with Vic Reeves ===

In 1986, Mortimer went to the Goldsmiths Tavern in New Cross, London, to see a new show by the comedian Vic Reeves. Mortimer was impressed by the performance, particularly the character Tappy Lappy, which was Reeves attempting to tap dance while wearing a Bryan Ferry mask and planks on his feet. Mortimer approached Reeves after the show, and the two began writing material for the next week&#x27;s show together. They also became good friends and formed a band, the Potter&#x27;s Wheel. Mortimer began to perform on the show, which was christened &quot;Vic Reeves Big Night Out&quot;, creating characters such as the Singing Lawyer, Graham Lister, Judge Nutmeg and the Man With the Stick.

The show became successful in South London and eventually outgrew Goldsmiths Tavern, moving in 1988 to the Albany Empire in Deptford. Mortimer soon became an integral part of the performance, providing him with a weekly break from his legal work, which had begun to disillusion him.

Reeves and Mortimer made their television debut on the short-lived 1989 comedy chat show &quot;One Hour with Jonathan Ross&quot;, in the game show segment known as &quot;Knock down ginger&quot;. Later that year, the duo made their first television pilot together, &quot;Vic Reeves Big Night Out&quot;. The television show remained true to the nightclub act&#x27;s variety show format. Mortimer took a 10-week break from his legal job to record the series and never returned.

The two later created a one-off pilot for a sitcom called &quot;The Weekenders&quot; in 1992, followed by the sketch show &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot; in 1993, and &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;, a comedy panel show that first aired in December 1993. After being commissioned, &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; ran for five series between 1995 and 2002, with a special anniversary edition broadcast in December 2008. A sixth series was broadcast in late 2009, followed by a seventh series in mid-2010, and an eighth in 2011.

In 1999, Reeves and Mortimer appeared in a second sketch show called &quot;Bang Bang, It&#x27;s Reeves and Mortimer&quot;. A year later, Mortimer played the part of Jeff Randall in &quot;Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot;, opposite Reeves as Marty Hopkirk and Emilia Fox as Jeannie Hurst.

In 2003, Mortimer and Reeves were listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. In a 2005 poll to find the &quot;Comedians&#x27; Comedian&quot;, the duo were voted the 9th greatest comedy act of all time by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.

In 2004, Mortimer and Reeves wrote and starred in &quot;Catterick&quot;, a six-episode surreal comedy about an ex-soldier, Carl, who returns home from serving in Cyprus to join his brother Chris, who has agreed to help find Carl&#x27;s son. Cast included Reece Shearsmith, Matt Lucas, Morwenna Banks, Tim Healy, Mark Benton and Charlie Higson.
On 17 November 2007, Mortimer appeared as Reeves&#x27; hairdresser, Carl, in the weekly radio sketch show on BBC Radio 2 entitled &quot;Vic Reeves&#x27; House Arrest&quot;.

On 27 February 2008, Reeves announced that he and Mortimer were working together on a new sitcom about superheroes who get their powers through a malfunctioning telegraph pole.

In November 2013, Reeves and Mortimer filmed episodes of a new BBC sitcom, &quot;House of Fools&quot;, also featuring Matt Berry (as Beef), Morgana Robinson (as Julie) and Dan Skinner (as Bosh).

In October 2015, the pair cancelled the first leg of their live tour, &quot;25 Year of Reeves and Mortimer: The Poignant Moments&quot;, after Mortimer underwent an emergency triple heart bypass.

On 29 December 2017, Mortimer and Reeves starred in a relaunch and new singular episode of their comedy &quot;Big Night Out&quot; for the BBC. The show has been remade and subsequently renamed to &quot;Vic and Bob&#x27;s Big Night Out&quot;. The episode remained true to the classic &quot;Big Night Out&quot; formula and was composed of various comedy songs, skits, characters and sketches. This was the first time the &quot;Big Night Out&quot; series had featured Mortimer&#x27;s name in the title. A full series of &quot;Vic and Bob&#x27;s Big Night Out&quot; began on BBC Four in November 2018.

=== Solo career and appearances ===
* In 1997, in collaboration with Chris Rea, Mortimer recorded Rea&#x27;s hit &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; with his favourite football team, Middlesbrough. The single reached No. 44 in the UK Singles Chart.

*Mortimer voiced the animated bulldog in adverts for Churchill Insurance. Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Oh, yes!&quot; catchphrase is believed to be an impersonation of Potter the Janitor (played by Deryck Guyler) from the television series of the 1970s, &quot;Please Sir!&quot;.

* In April 2010, Mortimer appeared on the Sky1 panel show &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;, on Andrew Flintoff&#x27;s team.
* Mortimer has been a regular guest panellist on the BBC1 quiz show &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; since 2012, having appeared in eleven episodes up to the 2022 series. He has since stated that his appearances on this show have given him more recognition than any of his previous work.

*Mortimer has appeared on numerous episodes of the &quot;Sky1&quot; comedy panel game &quot;Duck Quacks Don&#x27;t Echo&quot;, hosted by his regular &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; team captain, Lee Mack.
*In 2017, Mortimer competed in and won series 5 of &quot;Taskmaster&quot; against Aisling Bea, Sally Phillips, Nish Kumar and Mark Watson. He then competed in the &quot;Taskmaster: Champion of Champions&quot; series against Noel Fielding, Josh Widdicombe, Katherine Ryan and Rob Beckett, coming last.
*In June and July 2018, Mortimer teamed up with his longtime friend and fellow comedian, Paul Whitehouse, in a BBC2 six part comedy series, &quot;Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing&quot;. The two friends, who have both suffered from heart conditions, shared their thoughts and experiences while fishing at a variety of locations around the UK. Six series of the programme have aired to date; a book was released in 2020, series 4 and Christmas specials aired in 2021 and 2023.

Side dish was a shallow fried turbot. His chosen drink was a citrus IPA served at minus 20 degrees. Dessert was a syrup sponge pudding and custard, made by his wife. He was allowed to have a Boost baguette and a cube of frozen custard on his way home.
*In September 2021, Mortimer released an autobiography titled &quot;And Away...&quot;.
*Mortimer wrote &quot;The Satsuma Complex&quot;, a Sunday Times bestselling comic novel published in 2022. An audiobook was released, narrated by Mortimer and Sally Phillips.

== Personal life ==
Mortimer has suffered from rheumatoid arthritis since childhood; he controls it with steroids.

In October 2015, Mortimer underwent triple bypass surgery, which led to the cancellation of the first leg of the Reeves and Mortimer 25 Years tour. On the day of his hospital admission, he married Lisa Matthews, his girlfriend of 22 years, under a special marriage licence express from London. They have two sons.

Mortimer is a lifelong fan of his hometown football team Middlesbrough and the rock band Free. During his appearance on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, he revealed that he dealt with crippling shyness until the age of 30, which only began to improve after his initial television success; he also reflected on how his father&#x27;s early death had shaped his personality, despite not realising how much this event had affected him as a child.

<text>Eraño de Guzman Manalo (; January 2, 1925 – August 31, 2009), also known as Ka Erdy, was the second Executive Minister of the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), serving from April 19, 1963, until August 31, 2009. He took over the administration of the church after the death of his father, Felix Y. Manalo, in 1963. He was instrumental in the propagation and expansion of the church internationally.

==Biography==
Eraño G. Manalo was born at their residence at No. 42 Broadway Avenue, New Manila, San Juan, Rizal (now part of Quezon City) on January 2, 1925. He was the fifth child of Felix Y. Manalo and Honorata de Guzman. His name came from a reversal and elision of the term &quot;New Era&quot;, which his father used to describe what he felt was &quot;a new Christian era&quot; as the Iglesia ni Cristo was established. His older siblings were Sisters Pilar and Avelina, and Brothers Dominador and Salvador. His youngest sibling is Brother Bienvenido, who is currently the head of INC&#x27;s construction and engineering department.

Eraño completed his elementary education at St. John&#x27;s Academy in San Juan, Metro Manila, starting at the age of six.

Manalo initially took up law school, but left his studies to become a minister of the INC. He started attending the church&#x27;s ministerial classes at the age of 16 and was ordained as a minister on May 10, 1947, in Locale Congregation of Tayuman, Ecclesiastical District of Manila, at the age of 22. He held various positions in the church including being the General Treasurer of the INC and circulation manager of the Pasugo magazine (now known as &quot;Pasugo: God&#x27;s Message&quot;). During this time, he wrote a 64-page booklet entitled &quot;Christ-God: Investigated-False&quot;.

On January 17, 1955, Eraño Manalo married Cristina Villanueva, with whom he has six children (Eduardo V. Manalo, Lolita Manalo-Hemedez, Erlinda Manalo-Alcantara, Liberty Manalo-Albert, Felix Nathaniel Manalo II and Marco Eraño Manalo). On February 18, 1953, ten years before his father&#x27;s death, he was elected successor to his father as Executive Minister. Following Eraño&#x27;s death, his son Eduardo then assumed the role of INC&#x27;s Executive Minister.

==Administration==

With the death of Felix Y. Manalo on April 12, 1963, Iglesia&#x27;s critics predicted the church&#x27;s decline and eventual fall. To them, the church&#x27;s popularity was due mainly to the charisma and leadership of Felix Y. Manalo. Barely a month after assuming his role as spiritual leader of the church, the young Manalo began visiting congregations nationwide. At every location he visited, he officiated worship services and staged massive religious rallies in public plazas. During this period of transition in what critics thought was the most vulnerable period of the church, Manalo further consolidated the gains of the church.

In 1947, Manalo became the General Treasurer of the church. He was later elected as successor to Felix Y. Manalo by provincial ministers as early as 1953. In 1957 he became the District Minister of Manila. Very few people outside of the church gave Manalo&#x27;s leadership potential enough credit. He would later initiate significant moves that would make the church to what it is today.

Manalo demonstrated the church responsiveness to the needs of the poor. Even before the government initiated agrarian reforms, Manalo established model land reforms. In 1965, the first of the resettlement farms was &quot;Maligaya&quot; farm in Palayan City, Nueva Ecija, Philippines. Similar projects were established in Cavite, Rizal and other provinces.

As early as 1967, four years after assuming leadership role, Manalo set his vision to overseas mission and global expansion. The first overseas INC mission was sent in 1968 on its 54th anniversary. On July 27, 1968, Executive Minister Eraño G. Manalo, officiated at the first worship service of the church outside the Philippines. This gathering held in Ewa Beach, Honolulu, Hawaii marked the establishment of the Honolulu congregation, the first overseas mission of the church. The following month, the Executive Minister was in California to establish the San Francisco congregation and lead its inaugural worship service. In 1971, the church set foot in Canada. In June 1987, the US Main Office (USMO) was set up in Daly City, California to assist the INC central administration in supervising the then 11 districts of the church in the West. The first local congregation in Latin America was established in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba in 1990. The following year, the church reached Mexico and Aruba. From 2000 and beyond, congregations rose in the Central and South American countries. The first local congregation in Europe was established in England in 1972. The church came to Germany and Switzerland in the mid-70s. By the end of the 1980s, congregations and missions could be found in the Scandinavian countries and their neighbors. The Rome, Italy congregation was established on July 27, 1994; the Jerusalem, Israel congregation on March 31, 1996; and the Athens, Greece congregation on May 10, 1997. The predecessors (prayer groups) of these full-fledged congregations began two decades earlier. Meanwhile, the mission first reached Spain in 1979. The first mission in northern Africa opened in Nigeria in October 1978. After a month, the King William’s Town congregation, in South Africa was established. A congregation was organised in Guam in 1969. In Australia, congregations have been established since mid-1970s. The church first reached China by way of Hong Kong, and Japan through Tokyo also in the 1970s. Missions have also opened in Kazakh SSR (now Kazakhstan) and Sakhalin Island in Russian SFSR (now Russia). In Southeast Asia, the first congregation in Thailand was established in 1976 and missions have already been conducted in Brunei since 1979. In addition, there are also congregations in Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia.

The INC started operating a radio station in 1969. While its first television program aired in 1983. The Ministerial Institute of Development, currently the New Era University College of Evangelical Ministry (later called as Iglesia ni Cristo School for Ministers), was founded in 1974 in Quiapo, Manila. It moved to its current location in Quezon City in 1978. As of 1995, it had 4,500 students and five extension schools in Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, Pampanga and Rizal. In 1965, INC launched its first resettlement and land reform program in Barrio Maligaya, Laur, Nueva Ecija. In 1971, the INC Central Office building was built in Quezon City. Thirteen years later, the 7,000-seater Central Temple was added in the complex. The Tabernacle, a tent-like multipurpose building which can accommodate up to 4,000 persons, was finished in 1989. The complex also includes the New Era University, a higher-education institution run by the INC.

===Death===
INC Spokesperson and General Evangelist, Bienvenido C. Santiago Sr, confirmed Manalo&#x27;s death in an announcement delivered in Filipino/Tagalog over various radio and television stations including Net 25 (along with sister station DZEC-AM), translated below:

Santiago also stated that according to Dr. Ray Melchor Santos, Manalo died due to cardiopulmonary arrest. On Monday September 7, 2009, the remains of Manalo were temporarily interred at the INC Tabernacle at 12:00 PST while his mausoleum is being built near the memorial statue of his father, Felix Y. Manalo at INC Central Office Complex. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo declared September 7 a national day of mourning.

==Recognition==

The Quezon City government renamed what was Central Avenue to Eraño G. Manalo Avenue. Ordinance number SP-1961 S-2009 the Quezon City Council stated the renaming was to is recognition of &quot;“his greatness and nobility” in leading the powerful religious group.&quot;

On April 13, 2010, The Philippine Postal Corporation announced that it will issue a limited edition postage stamp in his honour. The stamp will be released on April 23 with 100,000 pieces with a denomination of P 7.00.

<text>Harold Victor Bauer (28 April 1873 – 12 March 1951) was an English-born pianist of Jewish heritage who began his musical career as a violinist.

==Biography==

Harold Bauer was born in Kingston upon Thames; his father was a German violinist and his mother was English. He took up the study of the violin under the direction of his father and Adolf Pollitzer. He made his debut as a violinist in London in 1883, and for nine years toured England. In 1892, however, he went to Paris and studied the piano under Ignacy Jan Paderewski for a year, though still maintaining his interest in the violin. An anecdote reports that Paderewski jokingly told Bauer to concentrate on the piano because &quot;You have such beautiful hair&quot;. In 1893, in Paris, he and Achille Rivarde premiered Frederick Delius&#x27;s Violin Sonata in B major.

During 1893-94 he travelled all through Russia accompanying the noted soprano Mademoiselle Nikita and giving piano recitals and concerts, after which he returned to Paris. Further recitals in the French capital brought him renown, and he almost immediately received engagements in France, Germany and Spain. His reputation was rapidly enhanced by these performances, and his field of operation extended through the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, England, Scandinavia and the United States.

In 1900, Harold Bauer made his debut in America with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, performing the U.S. premiere of Johannes Brahms&#x27; Piano Concerto No.1 in D minor. On 18 December 1908, he gave the world premiere performance of Claude Debussy&#x27;s piano suite &quot;Children&#x27;s Corner&quot; in Paris. After that he settled in the United States, and was a founder of the Beethoven Association.

Between 1915 and 1929 he recorded over 100 pieces for the Duo-Art and Ampico reproducing pianos, one of the most prolific virtuoso pianists in this medium of his era.

Harold Bauer was also an influential teacher and editor, heading the Piano Department at the well known Manhattan School of Music. Starting in 1941, Bauer taught winter master classes at the University of Miami and served as a visiting professor at the University of Hartford Hartt School of Music with Maestro and Founder - Moshe Paranov and head of the Piano Department - Raymond Hanson, from 1946 until his death in Miami, Florida, in 1951. 

He published &quot;Harold Bauer, His Book&quot; (New York, 1948).

== Family ==
Harold&#x27;s sister Ethel Bauer was also a concert pianist active in London. Harold was married twice. He first married the divorcée Maria Knapp (1861–1940) in 1906 until her death. In January 1941, he married again, the concert pianist, colleague, and his former student, Wynne Pyle. He had no children by either marriage.

== Students ==

Students of Harold Bauer included George Copeland, Vera Franceschi, Robert Schrade, Frank Sheridan, Abbey Simon, Bruce Simonds, Eleanor Spencer, and Dora Zaslavsky. Harold Bauer taught many other prominent pianists in his day, including composer Viola Cole-Audet, John Elvin, who was a piano professor at Oberlin College in Ohio and Consuelo Elsa Clark, a piano teacher at the New York College of Music from 1918 to 1968 and the teacher of the composer Michael Jeffrey Shapiro.

<text>Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser-assisted sub-epithelial keratectomy (or laser epithelial keratomileusis) (LASEK) are laser eye surgery procedures intended to correct a person&#x27;s vision, reducing dependency on glasses or contact lenses. LASEK and PRK permanently change the shape of the anterior central cornea using an excimer laser to ablate (remove by vaporization) a small amount of tissue from the corneal stroma at the front of the eye, just under the corneal epithelium. The outer layer of the cornea is removed prior to the ablation.

A computer system tracks the patient&#x27;s eye position 60 to 4,000 times per second, depending on the specifications of the laser that is used. The computer system redirects laser pulses for precise laser placement. Most modern lasers will automatically center on the patient&#x27;s visual axis and will pause if the eye moves out of range and then resume ablating at that point after the patient&#x27;s eye is re-centered.

The outer layer of the cornea, or epithelium, is a soft, rapidly regrowing layer in contact with the tear film that can completely replace itself from limbal stem cells within a few days with no loss of clarity. The deeper layers of the cornea, as opposed to the outer epithelium, are laid down early in life and have very limited regenerative capacity. The deeper layers, if reshaped by a laser or cut by a microtome, will remain that way permanently with only limited healing or remodelling.

With PRK, the corneal epithelium is removed and discarded, allowing the cells to regenerate after the surgery. The procedure is distinct from LASIK (laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis), a form of laser eye surgery where a permanent flap is created in the deeper layers of the cornea. However, PRK takes longer to heal and can, initially, cause more discomfort.

== LASEK ==

LASEK and PRK are two different procedures. While both procedures interact with the epithelium atop the cornea, the PRK procedure removes this entirely, while LASEK brushes the material away for the procedure, before being placed back for healing after laser surgery. The procedure can be used to treat astigmatism, nearsightedness, and farsightedness. During the procedure, the epithelium is displaced using a diluted alcohol solution.

PRK has advantages over LASIK in that it avoids added complications associated with the flap created during surgery. The procedure may also reduce the chances of dry eye symptoms after surgery. Due to the PRK procedure not requiring a surgical flap, athletes or individuals concerned with trauma introduced by the flap may see benefits to LASEK. Patients that wear contact lenses will typically need to stop wearing these for a specified time before the procedure.

PRK disadvantages include a longer recovery time for vision in contrast to LASIK which may be between five days and two weeks for blurred vision to properly clear. Another disadvantage is that patient may be required to apply steroid eye drops for a few weeks longer than that of a LASIK procedure.

When LASEK is compared to LASIK, LASIK can have better outcomes with corneal haze while LASEK has a lower rate of flap complications than LASIK.

==Eligibility==
There are a number of basic criteria which a person should satisfy:
* Normal ocular health
* Age 18 years or older
* Stable refraction error (no noticeable change in the last year) correctable to 20/40 or better
* Between −1.00 to −12.00 diopters of myopia
* Not pregnant at the time of surgery
* Realistic expectations of the final results (with a complete understanding of the benefits, as well as the possible risks)
* Pupil size 6 mm or less in a dark room is ideal (but some newer lasers may be acceptable for larger pupils)
* Assessment of allergies, (e.g., pollen) where allergy may complicate the eyelid margins following surgery leading to dry eye.

There are also some pre-existing conditions that may complicate or preclude the treatment.
* Collagen vascular disease (e.g., corneal ulceration or melting)
* Ocular disease (e.g., dry eye, keratoconus, glaucoma)
* Systemic disorders (e.g., diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis)
* History of side effects from steroids
* Granular corneal dystrophy type II

==Possible complications==
Some complications that can be temporary or permanent include:
* Dry eyes
* Recurrent erosions during sleep
* Long healing period
* Pain
* Glare, halos, or starburst aberrations
* Increased ocular straylight
* Under- or overcorrection
* Recurrence of myopia
* Corneal haze
* Scarring
* Reduced best corrected visual acuity
* Reduced acuity in low light
* Increased sensitivity
* Neuropathic pain

===Dry eyes===
As with other forms of refractive surgery, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, colloquially referred to as &#x27;dry eye,&#x27; is the most common complication of PRK, and can be permanent. In more advanced cases, recurrent erosions occur during sleeping from adherence of the corneal epithelium to the upper eyelid with rapid eye movement. Adjuvant polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with high Omega-3 content before and after surgery improves sicca, possibly due to their anti-inflammatory effects. Foods containing PUFAs include flax and fish oil. Brush PRK to denude the epithelium, instead of alcohol based techniques, also result in quantitatively lower ocular dryness after surgery. The amount of corneal hazing after surgery is also decreased with brush technique. The platelet activating factor blocker LAU-0901 has shown effect in mitigating dry eye in mouse models. Rabbit models have also shown improvement with topical nerve growth factor (NGF) in combination with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Mitomycin C worsens post-surgical dry eye.

PRK may be performed on one eye at a time to assess the results of the procedure and ensure adequate vision during the healing process. Activities requiring good binocular vision may have to be suspended between surgeries and during the sometimes extended healing periods.

===Halos, starbursts and refractive errors===
PRK can be associated with glare, halos, and starburst aberrations, which can occur with postoperative corneal haze during the healing process. Night halos are seen more often in revisions with small ablation zone size. With more recent developments in laser technology, this is less common after 6 months though symptoms can persist beyond a year in some cases. A dilute concentration of the chemotherapeutic agent, Mitomycin-C, can be applied briefly at the completion of surgery to reduce risk of hazing, although with increased risk of sicca.

Predictability of the resulting refractive correction after healing is not totally exact, particularly for those with more severe myopia. This can lead to under/overcorrection of the refractive error. In the case of the overcorrection, premature consequences of presbyopia is a possibility. Experienced surgeons employ a custom-profile algorithm to further enhance predictability in their results.

In 1 to 3% of cases, loss of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) can result, due to decentered ablative zones or other surgical complications. PRK results in improved BCVA about twice as often as it causes loss. Decentration is becoming less and less of a problem with more modern lasers using sophisticated eye centering and tracking methods.

==Comparison to LASIK==
A systematic review that compared PRK and LASIK concluded that LASIK has shorter recovery time and less pain. The two techniques after a period of one year have similar results.

A 2016 systematic review found that it was unclear whether there were any differences in efficacy, accuracy, and adverse effects when comparing PRK and LASEK procedures among people with low to moderate myopia. The review stated that no trials have been conducted comparing the two procedures on people with high myopia.

A 2017 systematic review found uncertainty in visual acuity, but found that in one study, those receiving PRK were less likely to achieve a refractive error, and were less likely to have an over-correction than compared to LASIK.

==Types==
* LASIK
* Alcohol assisted PRK
* Transepithelial PRK (TransPRK)
* ASA (Advanced Surface Ablation) LASEK, which uses Amoils Brush and gas cooling to reduce the pain
* M-LASEK, which Uses mitomycin in an attempt to reduce post-operative haze but is of dubious effectiveness. Possible long-term side effects are unknown.

==US Military==
In the U.S.A. candidates who have had PRK can get a blanket waiver for the Special Forces Qualification, Combat Diving Qualification and Military Free Fall courses. PRK and LASIK are both waived for Airborne, Air Assault and Ranger schools. However, those who have had LASIK must enroll in an observational study, if a slot is available, to undergo training in Special Forces qualification. LASIK is disqualifying/non-waiverable for several United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) schools (HALO, SCUBA, SERE) per Army Regulation 40-501.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration will consider applicants with PRK once they are fully healed and stabilized, provided there are no complications and all other visual standards are met. Pilots should be aware, however, that potential employers, such as commercial airlines and private companies, may have policies that consider refractive surgery a disqualifying condition. Also, civilians who wish to fly military aircraft should know that there are restrictions on those who have had corrective surgery. The Army now permits flight applicants who have undergone PRK or LASIK. Uncomplicated, successful corneal refractive surgery does not require a waiver and is noted as information only.

The Navy and Marines will routinely grant a waiver for pilots or student naval aviators, as well as naval flight officers, UAS operators and aircrew, to fly after PRK and LASIK, assuming preoperative refractive standards are met, no complications in the healing process were encountered, asymptomatic with regard to significant halos, glare or dry eye, off all medications, and passing their standard vision tests. In one study, 967 of 968 naval aviators having PRK returned to duty involving flying after the procedure. In fact, the U.S. Navy now offers free PRK and LASIK surgery at the National Naval Medical Center to Naval Academy Midshipmen who intend to pursue career paths requiring good uncorrected vision, including flight school and special operations training.

The U.S. Air Force approves the use of PRK and LASIK. Since 2000 the USAF has conducted PRK for aviators at the Wilford Hall Medical Center. More airmen were allowed over the years and in 2004 the USAF approved LASIK for aviators, with limits on the type of aircraft they could fly. Then in 2007 those limits were lifted. Most recently in 2011 the USAF expanded the program, making it easier for more airmen to qualify for the surgery. Current airmen (Active Duty and Air Reserve Components who are eligible) are authorized surgery at any DOD Refractive Surgery Center. Those airmen not eligible, are still able to get the surgery done at their own expense by a civilian surgeon, but must first be approved (approval is based on the same USAF-RS program). Others that do not fall into those categories (i.e. applicants who are seeking a pilot slot) can still elect to have the surgery done, but must follow the criteria in accordance with the USAF Waiver Guide. Those applicants will be evaluated at the ACS during their Medical Flight Screening appointment to determine if they meet waiver criteria.

In the majority of patients, PRK has proven to be a safe and effective procedure for the correction of myopia. PRK is still evolving with other countries currently using refined techniques and alternative procedures. Many of these procedures are under investigation in the U.S. Given that PRK is not reversible, a patient considering PRK is recommended to contact an eye-care practitioner for assistance in making an informed decision concerning the potential benefits and liabilities that may be specific to them.

==History==
The first PRK procedure was performed in 1987 by Dr. Theo Seiler, then at the Free University Medical Center in Berlin, Germany. The first procedure similar to LASEK was performed at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in 1996 by ophthalmologist and refractive surgeon Dimitri Azar. Dr. Massimo Camellin, an Italian surgeon, was the first to write a scientific publication about the new surgical technique in 1998, coining the term LASEK for laser epithelial keratomileusis.

<doc id="528464" wikidata="Q639481" url="?curid=528464" title="Ed Wood (film)">
<text>Ed Wood is a 1994 American biographical comedy-drama film directed and produced by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp as Ed Wood, the eponymous cult filmmaker. The film concerns the period in Wood&#x27;s life when he made his best-known films as well as his relationship with actor Bela Lugosi, played by Martin Landau. Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Jeffrey Jones, Lisa Marie, and Bill Murray are among the supporting cast.

The film was conceived by writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. Alexander first proposed it as a documentary, when he was a student at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Years later, irritated at being thought of solely as writers for family films with their work on &quot;Problem Child&quot; (1990) and its 1991 sequel, Alexander and Karaszewski struck a deal with Burton and Denise Di Novi to produce &quot;Ed Wood&quot;. Initially, Michael Lehmann was chosen to direct the project, but due to scheduling conflicts with his work on the film &quot;Airheads&quot; (1994), he had to vacate the director&#x27;s position which was taken over by Tim Burton.

&quot;Ed Wood&quot; was originally in development at Columbia Pictures, but the studio put the film in &quot;turnaround&quot; over Burton&#x27;s decision to shoot in black-and-white. &quot;Ed Wood&quot; was taken to Walt Disney Studios, which produced the film through its Touchstone Pictures banner. The film proved financially unsuccessful, returning only $13.8 million against an $18 million budget, but was met with critical acclaim upon release, with particular praise for Depp and Landau&#x27;s performances and the makeup, and won two Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actor for Landau and Best Makeup for Rick Baker (who designed Landau&#x27;s prosthetic makeup), Ve Neill and Yolanda Toussieng. The film is now considered to be a cult classic and one of Burton&#x27;s best works.

==Plot==
In 1952, aspiring writer and director Ed Wood is struggling to enter the film industry. Upon hearing of an announcement in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine that producer George Weiss is trying to purchase Christine Jorgensen&#x27;s life story, Ed meets with Weiss to direct a now fictionalized film titled &quot;I Changed My Sex!&quot;, but is not hired. Ed then meets his longtime idol, horror film actor Bela Lugosi, with whom he becomes friends. Ed soon persuades Weiss to let him direct the film by convincing him that having a star in the film would sell tickets, and they could sign Lugosi for a low price. At the same time, Ed shows the film&#x27;s completed script to his girlfriend, Dolores Fuller, and soon reveals that he is secretly a transvestite, having worn women&#x27;s clothing for personal comfort since childhood. This discovery causes their relationship to be strained, as Fuller has a difficult time accepting it.

During production for &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot;, Ed and Weiss argue over the film&#x27;s title and subject matter, but Weiss eventually plays by Ed&#x27;s rules, on the condition that the film&#x27;s footage meets seven reels. As filming gets going, with the story now about a transvestite, Ed takes to film production with an unusual approach; shooting only one take per scene, giving actors very little direction, and using stock footage to fill in gaps. The movie is released to critical and commercial failure, preventing Ed from getting work at Weiss&#x27; Screen Classics or making a partnership with Warner Bros. executive Feldman (who at first believes the film to be a practical joke played on him by William Wellman). On the advice of Fuller, Ed decides to finance his next film independently. In his efforts to fund &quot;Bride of the Atom&quot;, Ed gets Bela a guest spot on a TV variety show, and meets The Amazing Criswell, who helps Ed in selling himself better. He also meets and befriends Tor Johnson after a wrestling match, and casts him as Lobo. During this time, Ed discovers that Lugosi has developed a morphine addiction.

Following a failed fundraising dinner at the Brown Derby, Ed meets Loretta King, whom he mistakes for a wealthy heiress; he asks her to fund the film and ends up casting her as the lead instead of Fuller, with Fuller being assigned a smaller role, which further strains her relationship with Ed. Filming begins but is halted when it is revealed that Loretta is actually poor, so Ed convinces meat packing industry tycoon Don McCoy to continue funding the film, who agrees as long as his son is cast as the lead and the film ends with an explosion. When filming wraps up, with the title being changed to &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot;, Fuller breaks up with Ed at the wrap party out of frustration at Ed&#x27;s cross-dressing, his circle of misfit friends, and the poor quality of Ed&#x27;s movies. Lugosi attempts to conduct a double suicide with Ed after the government cuts off his unemployment benefit, but is talked out of it. Lugosi checks himself into rehab to cure his drug addiction, and Ed meets Kathy O&#x27;Hara, who is visiting her father there. He takes her on a date and reveals his transvestism to her, which she accepts, and they begin a relationship. After Lugosi is checked out of rehab, he and Ed shoot a film with Lugosi outside his home. Ed and company (along with TV horror icon Vampira) later attend the premiere of &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot;, where an angry mob chases them out of the theater.

Afterwards, Lugosi dies, leaving Ed without a star. After learning that his landlord&#x27;s church is struggling to produce a series of religious films about the twelve apostles, Ed convinces him to allow his church to fund his script for a sci-fi film, &quot;Grave Robbers from Outer Space&quot;, which could result in a box-office success and generate enough money for the landlord&#x27;s dream project. Ed hires Vampira, Tor, Criswell, and Kathy&#x27;s chiropractor Dr. Tom Mason to star in the film (the latter being a stand-in for Lugosi), and he and all his friends partake in a baptism ceremony at the church. During filming, Ed has conflicts with the Baptists over the title, script content, Tor&#x27;s performance, and Ed&#x27;s B movie directing style, eventually renaming the film &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;. Ed soon leaves the set out of frustration to go to the nearest bar, where he has an encounter with filmmaker Orson Welles, who shares Wood&#x27;s frustration: as he claims to be struggling with similar issues while working on &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, and advises him to assert his vision and resist artistic changes imposed onto him by sponsors, citing &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; as an example of a project of his wherein he had complete creative control. Filming finishes with Ed taking action against his producers&#x27; wishes.

&quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot; is first shown in a huge premiere, attended by dozens of people, where Ed introduces the film in honor of Lugosi, and as the film plays, he quietly states his belief that this film will be his most well-known. After the film ends, a proud Ed and Kathy go to Las Vegas to get married. Closing texts reveal that Ed was unable to gain mainstream success in the film industry before his death in 1978, and was posthumously named &quot;Worst Director of All Time&quot;, though that honor ended up earning him worldwide acclaim and a new generation of fans.

==Cast==
* Johnny Depp as Ed Wood: Burton approached Depp and &quot;within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed,&quot; the actor remembers. At the time, Depp was depressed about films and filmmaking. By accepting this part, it gave him a &quot;chance to stretch out and have some fun&quot; and working with Martin Landau &quot;rejuvenated my love for acting&quot;. Depp was already familiar with some of Wood&#x27;s films through John Waters, who had shown him &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot; and &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot;. To get a handle on how to portray Wood, Depp studied the performance of Jack Haley as the Tin Man in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, and the acting of Mickey Rooney, Ronald Reagan and Casey Kasem. He watched several Reagan speeches because the actor felt that &quot;he had a kind of blind optimism that was perfect for Ed Wood.&quot; Depp also borrowed some of Kasem&#x27;s cadence and &quot;that utterly confident, breezy salesman quality in his voice&quot;.
* Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi: An old popular horror film actor whom Ed helps. Rick Baker created Landau&#x27;s prosthetic makeup. Baker did not use extensive make-up appliances, only enough to resemble Lugosi and allow Landau to use his face to act and express emotion, which consisted of a set of ears, nose, chin, and an appliance that covered his upper lip. For research, Landau watched 25 of Lugosi&#x27;s films and seven interviews between 1931 and 1956. Landau did not want to deliver an over-the-top performance: &quot;Lugosi was theatrical, but I never wanted the audience to feel I was an actor chewing the scenery... I felt it had to be Lugosi&#x27;s theatricality, not mine.&quot;
* Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller: Ed&#x27;s girlfriend before his relationship with Kathy. Dolores is embarrassed by Ed&#x27;s transvestism, which leads to their breakup. Dolores later becomes a successful songwriter for Elvis Presley.
* Patricia Arquette as Kathy O&#x27;Hara: Ed&#x27;s girlfriend after his relationship with Dolores. Kathy does not have a problem with Ed&#x27;s transvestism, and eventually marries Ed. Their marriage lasts until Ed&#x27;s death in 1978. She never remarried. Arquette met her real-life counterpart during filming. The actress found her to be &quot;very graceful and very nice&quot;.
* Jeffrey Jones as The Amazing Criswell: A local psychic TV entertainer. Criswell helps Ed with usual production duties, finding investors and acting in Ed&#x27;s films.
* G. D. Spradlin as Reverend Lemon: a Baptist minister who funds &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;.
* Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio as Orson Welles: Appears in a cameo late in the film. Maurice LaMarche provided Welles&#x27; voice in an uncredited performance.
* Lisa Marie as Maila Nurmi / Vampira: Hostess of the local &quot;Vampira Show&quot;. She is dismissive of Ed at first but decides to join the cast of &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;, on the condition that she has no lines.
* Bill Murray as John &quot;Bunny&quot; Breckinridge: Ed&#x27;s drag queen friend who helps him with &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;.
* Mike Starr as George Weiss: Short-tempered and foul-mouthed Z movie producer, known for his work on exploitation films. Weiss hires Ed to direct &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot;. He threatens to kill Ed over the phone following &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot;″s critical and commercial failure.
* Max Casella and Brent Hinkley as Paul Marco and Conrad Brooks: Two of Ed&#x27;s all-around production assistants and frequent actors. Paul is hired to find the Lugosi stand-in for &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;, while Conrad accidentally has a brief dispute with Lugosi during &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot;.
* Juliet Landau as Loretta King: King replaces Dolores in &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot; after Wood mistakes her for an heiress able to front the money for the production costs.
* George &quot;The Animal&quot; Steele as Tor Johnson: A Swedish professional wrestler hired by Wood to be in two of his films, &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot; and &quot;Plan 9&quot;.
* Ned Bellamy as Tom Mason: Kathy&#x27;s chiropractor who is chosen to be Lugosi&#x27;s stand-in for &quot;Plan 9&quot;.
* Stanley DeSantis as Mr. Feldman: an executive at Warner Bros., to whom Ed shows the first cut of &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot; in an attempt to make movies for Warner Bros.; he later tells Ed over the phone that it is the worst picture he has ever seen.
* Rance Howard as Old Man McCoy: a meat packing tycoon, who agrees to fund Ed&#x27;s next picture, &quot;Bride of The Monster&quot;, in exchange for his son Tony being the leading man and the film ending with an explosion.

The film also includes cameos from actors who worked with Wood on &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;, Gregory Walcott and Conrad Brooks.

==Production==
Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski conceived the idea for a biopic of Ed Wood when they were students at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Alexander even proposed making a documentary about Wood, &quot;The Man in the Angora Sweater&quot;, in his sophomore year at USC. However, Karaszewski figured, &quot;there would be no one on the planet Earth who would make this movie or want to make this movie, because these aren&#x27;t the sort of movies that are made.&quot; Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for family films for their work on &quot;Problem Child&quot; and &quot;Problem Child 2&quot;, Alexander and Karaszewski wrote a 10-page film treatment for &quot;Ed Wood&quot; and pitched the idea to &quot;Heathers&quot; director Michael Lehmann, with whom they attended USC film school. The basis for their treatment came from Rudolph Grey&#x27;s &quot;Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr.&quot;, a full-length biography, which draws on interviews from Wood&#x27;s family and colleagues. Lehmann presented their treatment to his producer on &quot;Heathers&quot;, Denise Di Novi. Di Novi had previously worked with Tim Burton on &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;, &quot;Batman Returns&quot; and &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, and a deal was struck with Lehmann as director and Burton and Di Novi producing.

Burton began reading &quot;Nightmare of Ecstasy&quot; and some of Wood&#x27;s letters. He was taken by how he &quot;wrote about his films as if he was making &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, you know, whereas other people perceived them as, like, the worst movies ever&quot;. Burton admits to having always been a fan of Ed Wood, which is why the biopic is filmed with an aggrandizing bias born of his admiration for Wood&#x27;s work, rather than the derisive attitude of Wood&#x27;s detractors. The relationship between Wood and Lugosi in the script echoes closely Burton&#x27;s relationship with his own idol and two-time colleague, Vincent Price. He said in an interview, &quot;Meeting Vincent had an incredible impact on me, the same impact Ed must have felt meeting and working with his idol.&quot; Meanwhile, Burton had been asked to direct &quot;Mary Reilly&quot; for Columbia Pictures with Winona Ryder in the title role.

However, Burton dropped out of &quot;Mary Reilly&quot; over Columbia&#x27;s decision to fast-track the film and their interest with Julia Roberts in the title role instead of Ryder. This prompted Burton to become interested in directing &quot;Ed Wood&quot; himself, on the understanding that it could be done quickly. Lehmann said, &quot;Tim wanted to do this movie immediately and direct, but I was already committed to &quot;Airheads&quot;.&quot; Lehmann was given executive producer credit. Alexander and Karaszewski delivered a 147-page screenplay in six weeks. Burton read the first draft and immediately agreed to direct the film as it stood, without any changes or rewrites. &quot;Ed Wood&quot; gave Burton the opportunity to make a film that was more character-driven as opposed to style-driven. He said in an interview, &quot;On a picture like this I find you don&#x27;t need to storyboard. You&#x27;re working mainly with actors, and there&#x27;s no effects going on, so it&#x27;s best to be more spontaneous.&quot;

Initially, &quot;Ed Wood&quot; was in development with Columbia, but when Burton decided he wanted to shoot the film in black-and-white, studio head Mark Canton would not agree to it unless Columbia was given a first-look deal. Burton said black-and-white was &quot;right for the material and the movie, and this was a movie that &quot;had&quot; to be in black-and-white&quot;. He insisted on total creative control, and so in April 1993, a month before the original start date, Canton put &quot;Ed Wood&quot; into turnaround. The decision sparked interest from Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures, and 20th Century Fox in optioning the film rights, but Burton accepted an offer from Walt Disney Studios, who had previously produced &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;. Similar to &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, Disney released &quot;Ed Wood&quot; under their Touchstone Pictures banner. With a budget of $18 million, Disney did not feel the film was that much of a risk, and granted Burton total creative autonomy. Burton also refused a salary, and was not paid for his work on &quot;Ed Wood&quot;. Principal photography began in August 1993, and lasted 72 days. Despite his previous six-film relationship with Danny Elfman, Burton chose Howard Shore to write the film score. Under the pressure of finishing the score for &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, Burton&#x27;s relationship with Elfman became strained and Burton admitted he and Elfman experienced &quot;creative differences&quot; during &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;.

The film was shot at various locations in and around the Los Angeles area.

==Historical accuracy==
When describing the film&#x27;s accuracy, Burton explained, &quot;It&#x27;s not like a completely hardcore realistic biopic. In doing a biopic you can&#x27;t help but get inside the person&#x27;s spirit a little bit, so for me, some of the film is trying to be through Ed a little bit. So it&#x27;s got an overly optimistic quality to it.&quot; Burton acknowledged that he probably portrayed Wood and his crew in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, stating he did not want to ridicule people who had already been ridiculed for a good deal of their life. Burton decided not to depict the darker side of Wood&#x27;s life because his letters never alluded to this aspect and remained upbeat. To this end, Burton wanted to make the film through Wood&#x27;s eyes. He said in an interview, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen anything like them, the kind of bad poetry and redundancy– saying in, like, five sentences what it would take most normal people one ... Yet still there is a sincerity to them that is very unusual, and I always found that somewhat touching; it gives them a surreal, weirdly heartfelt feeling.&quot;

According to Bela G. Lugosi (his son), Forrest Ackerman, Dolores Fuller and Richard Sheffield, the film&#x27;s portrayal of Lugosi is inaccurate: in real life, he never used profanity, owned small dogs, or slept in coffins. Additionally, contrary to what was presented in the film, Bela was not thrown by a comic&#x27;s ad-libbing in a skit on a TV show involving Wood, but on another show years earlier before the two ever met.

Burton biographer Ken Hanke criticized the depiction of Dolores Fuller. &quot;The real Fuller is a lively, savvy, humorous woman,&quot; Hanke said, &quot;while Parker&#x27;s performance presents her as a kind of sitcom moron for the first part of the film and a rather judgmental and wholly unpleasant character in her later scenes.&quot; During her years with Wood, Fuller had regular TV jobs on &quot;Queen for a Day&quot; and &quot;The Dinah Shore Show&quot;, which are not mentioned. Fuller criticized Parker&#x27;s portrayal and Burton&#x27;s direction, but still gave &quot;Ed Wood&quot; a positive review. &quot;Despite the dramatic liberties, I think Tim Burton is fabulous. I wished they could have made it a deeper love story because we really loved each other. We strove to find investors together, I worked so hard to support Ed and I&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Ed Wood&quot; had its premiere at the 32nd New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center. The film was then shown shortly after at the 21st Telluride Film Festival and later at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival, where it was in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or.

=== Home media ===
The DVD edition of &quot;Ed Wood&quot; initially had difficulty reaching store shelves in the United States and Canada due to unspecified legal issues. The initial release had a featurette on transvestites — not relating to the film or its actors in any way — which was removed from subsequent releases. An initial street date of August 13, 2002, was announced only to be postponed. A new date of February 3, 2003 was set, only for it to be recalled again without explanation, although some copies quickly found their way to collectors&#x27; venues such as eBay. The DVD was finally released on October 19, 2004.

== Reception ==

===Box office===
&quot;Ed Wood&quot; had its limited release on September 30, 1994. It went into wide release on October 7, 1994 (just three days before what would have been Wood&#x27;s 70th birthday) in 623 theaters. The film grossed $1,903,768 in its opening weekend. The film went on to gross $5,887,457 in the United States and Canada and $13.8 million worldwide, less than the production budget of $18 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Ed Wood&quot; holds an approval rating of 92% based on 73 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Tim Burton and Johnny Depp team up to fête the life and work of cult hero Ed Wood, with typically strange and wonderful results.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave a largely positive review: &quot;What Burton has made is a film which celebrates Wood more than it mocks him, and which celebrates, too, the zany spirit of the 1950s exploitation films, in which a great title, a has-been star, and a lurid ad campaign were enough to get bookings for some of the oddest films ever made.&quot; Ebert and Gene Siskel gave the film &quot;Two Thumbs Up&quot; on &quot;Siskel and Ebert&quot;, with Siskel calling it &quot;a tribute to creative passion and also to friendship&quot; and &quot;one of the year&#x27;s very best&quot;.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised Burton&#x27;s decision to not make a direct satire or parody of Wood&#x27;s life. &quot;Ed Wood is Burton&#x27;s most personal and provocative movie to date,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Outrageously disjointed and just as outrageously entertaining, the picture stands as a successful outsider&#x27;s tribute to a failed kindred spirit.&quot;

Janet Maslin, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, thought Johnny Depp &quot;proved&quot; himself as an established &quot;certified great actor&quot;. &quot;Depp captures all the can-do optimism that kept Ed Wood going, thanks to an extremely funny ability to look at the silver lining of any cloud.&quot; Todd McCarthy from &quot;Variety&quot; called &quot;Ed Wood&quot; &quot;a fanciful, sweet-tempered biopic about the man often described as the worst film director of all time. Always engaging to watch and often dazzling in its imagination and technique, [the] picture is also a bit distended, and lacking in weight at its center. The result is beguiling rather than thrilling.&quot;

Richard Corliss, writing in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, gave a negative review. &quot;The script by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski posits Wood as a classic American optimist, a Capraesque hero with little to be optimistic about since he was also a classic American loser. That&#x27;s a fine start, but the film then marches in staid chronological order.&quot; Corliss continued, &quot;One wonders why this Burton film is so dishwatery, why it lacks the cartoon zest and outsider ache of &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; or &quot;Batman Returns&quot;.&quot; Burton calls &quot;Ed Wood&quot; one of his best films he made.

<text>The pseudobranch, also pseudobranchia, is the reduced first gill arch of a fish (on the inner surface of the opercle, near the junction of the preopercle) as well as a reduced &quot;false&quot; gill in some gastropods.

In teleost fish, the pseudobranchs are mostly without respiratory function, and in elasmobranchs they are the gill arch of the spiracle. The function of the pseudobranch is unknown, but it is believed that it supplies highly oxygenated blood to the optic choroid and retina and may have baroreceptor (pressure) and thermoregulation functions. It may also be a site of oxygen chemoreception.

<doc id="528467" wikidata="Q3312212" url="?curid=528467" title="Microkeratome">
<text>A microkeratome is a precision surgical instrument with an oscillating blade designed for creating the corneal flap in LASIK or ALK surgery. The normal human cornea varies from around 500 to 600 μm in thickness; and in the LASIK procedure, the microkeratome creates an 83 to 200 μm thick flap. The microkeratome uses an oscillating blade system, which has a blade that oscillates horizontally as the blade travels vertically for a precise cut. This piece of equipment is used all around the world to cut the cornea flap. The microkeratome is also used in Descemet&#x27;s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK), where it is used to slice a thin layer from the back of the donor cornea, which is then transplanted into the posterior cornea of the recipient. It was invented by Jose Barraquer and Cesar Carlos Carriazo in the 1950s in Colombia. 

As of 2023, there are two options for cutting into the cornea, the microkeratome and the femtosecond laser. The femtosecond laser emits ultrashort pulses that act as a blade to cut through the eye with precision and accuracy. Many surgeons differ in using a femtosecond laser or a microkeratome for their operations. Most surgeons and patients prefer the bladeless femtosecond laser. 

== History ==
The microkeratome was created in 1948 by Jose Ignacio Barraquer Moner in Bogota, Colombia. Barraquer was known as the father of refractive surgery due to his lifetime involvement and findings in the field. He developed the microkeratome for his keratomileusis (surgical reshaping of the cornea) procedure to correct the refractive error in the eye, which has evolved into the LASIK surgery of the 21st century. Refractive error is caused by an imperfect cornea that disallows light from correctly refracting and focusing on the retina, which results in blurry images. Correcting refractive error was Barraquer&#x27;s expertise and as time went on he continued to alter his method to correct refractive error. In 1958, Barraquer performed a lamellar resection in situ(corneal tissue replacement), where he used a prototype microkeratome that moved along a ring without a guide. By 1962, Barraquer created a more accurate microkeratome with a suction ring that would act as a guide. The suction ring suctioned the eye in place to create pressure for a precise cut. Barraquer&#x27;s surgery required the creation of a free flap, which meant the cornea was completely cut through. In 1991, Ioannis Pallikaris introduced the concept of a corneal hinge, which kept the cornea flap attached and helped with the healing process. During the same year, the motorized microkeratome was released. The motorized microkeratome contained a system of gears that ensured a constant blade velocity for a consistent flap thickness.

As the microkeratome gained exposure, surgical instrument corporations such as Moria Surgical, Chiron(bought by Bausch and Lomb Surgical), and Advanced Medical Optics began to create their microkeratomes. Moria Surgical still produces microkeratomes, but Chiron and Advanced Medical Optics have discontinued microkeratomes due to the femtosecond laser’s popularity. The Moria Surgical microkeratome was special because they created the first single-use microkeratome in 1999, which led to fewer complications regarding the blade. Chiron created the hansatome microkeratome, which became known as the industry standard for its safety and consistency. The hansatome also created an upper hinge, which lowered the risk of flap displacement from blinking. Advanced Medical Optics created the amadeus microkeratome, which used a single-hand design that lowered the learning curve for new surgeons.

As of 2023, the microkeratome is barely being used due to the increased use of the femtosecond laser. A few surgeons use the microkeratome due to lower cost and comfort with a microkeratome[8]. However, most surgeons and patients tend to prefer the bladeless femtosecond laser, due to its precision and safety.

== Components ==

=== Suction ring ===
During the keratectomy(surgical removal of a layer of the cornea) the suction ring fixates and stiffens the eye. Depending on the required flap diameter and the form of the cornea, different suction rings are employed. The upper part of the suction ring(plate) allocates the cornea with variable diameters.  A flexible silicone tubing connects the central section to the ring&#x27;s suction chamber. On the vertical outer part of the suction ring, there is a skirt that allows hermetic sealing for proper suction. All these parts are used together to create the suction ring. Using the correct suction ring minimizes the risk of complications.

=== Microkeratome cutting head ===
The microkeratome cutting head consists of a non-vibrating block and an oscillating blade unit. The non-vibrating block is composed of a tracking system, applanation plate, and cavities. The tracking system matches to the suction ring to connect the head to the ring using corresponding grooves. The applanation plate is the part of the block that precedes the oscillating blade and flattens the cornea, to create a constant angle for the blade for a constant flap thickness. The cavities of the block are used to hold the oscillating blade unit in place. The oscillating blade unit has a blade made of stainless steel or chrome-platinum. The standard oscillation speed of the blade is 15,000 rpm with an engagement angle between 24° and 30° depending on the required flap thickness. The direction of the cut determines the type of corneal flaps created on the cornea.

=== Drive unit ===
The drive unit is attached to the microkeratome head to ensure that the drive axis fits the blade and oscillates correctly. The drive unit uses either a single or dual electric motor for automated translation. For manual head translation, a gas turbine is used for blade oscillation.

=== Central unit ===
The central unit delivers the energy needed to power the drive unit and creates pressure between the eyeball and the suction ring. One pedal is used to start and stop the pressure for the suction ring. The second pedal controls the blade oscillation of the microkeratome. 

== Mechanism of operation ==
During refractive eye surgery, the microkeratome section is done manually or automatically by the surgeon in around 5 seconds. The automated propulsion of the head offers a steady velocity to produce a constant flap thickness, while when done manually, the velocity is inconsistent, which will create an irregular flap thickness.

First, the microkeratome is fixated onto the eye by placing a suction ring onto the cornea with the pupil in the center to stabilize the eye. The suction ring comes in either disposable plastic or metal and applies pressure from about 60 to 160 mm Hg, to stabilize the eye for a clean cut. After, the surgeon places topical anesthetic to moisten the cornea for the cut. Then, the head of the microkeratome is docked onto the suction ring so that it can glide across. The oscillating blade of the microkeratome then proceeds across the eye at a steady velocity, so that the thickness of the flap created is precise. For a more precise flap thickness, the surgeon must pay attention to the blade&#x27;s sharpness, protrusion, angle, oscillation speed, and velocity. In general, the slower the velocity, the thicker the cut in the cornea. The microkeratome then reverses out of the cut, which allows the suction to be released from the eye to decrease the risk of epithelial defects. After the cut is created, the eye surgery can proceed as required. The blade of the microkeratome can be reused, but most surgeons use a new blade for each eye since slight dullness can cause complications.

== Advantages ==
The microkeratome is a tool that has remained reliable throughout its history. The microkeratome comes with many benefits including speed, comfort, and price. The microkeratome operation only takes around 5 seconds. Since the operation is short, the suction duration is short, which allows the patient to be more comfortable. Also, after the procedure, the microkeratome causes less inflammation when compared to the femtosecond laser. Additionally, surgery using a microkeratome costs much less than femtosecond laser surgery. In the US, cost for LASIK surgery with a microkeratome is around $1,500 per eye, while laser surgery costs around $2,500 per eye.

== Complications ==
Both the microkeratome and femtosecond laser have low complication rates, with the microkeratome at approximately 0.6% and the femtosecond laser at 0.3%. Rare complications arise including the buttonhole flap, irregular flap, thin flap, incomplete flap, small flap, or free cap. These are all different imperfect flaps that force the abandonment of the surgery. To avoid these flap complications there are a set of rules regarding different eye types, such as a flat cornea, steep cornea, small cornea, and large cornea.

The most common complication with a microkeratome is an epithelial defect, the loss of focal areas of the epithelium. The defect can cause pain, tearing, blurry vision, redness, and photophobia. This is caused by the microkeratome&#x27;s shearing force effect on the epithelium from the basement membrane.

<text>Carl Adolph Wilhelm “Willy” Burmester (16 March 186916 January 1933) was a German violinist.

==Life and career==
Willy Burmester was born in Hamburg and was a pupil of Joseph Joachim, with whom he studied for many years in Berlin. In 1885, however, he seceded from the Joachim school, and commenced to develop his technique with a view to achieving virtuosity rather than a classic purity of style.

Burmester&#x27;s rendering of the classics was said to be somewhat cold and devoid of feeling. Nonetheless, he was a well-developed artist: his taste was broad enough to include all schools of composition in his repertoire. His was at his best as an interpreter of the works of Paganini. On the continent his reputation was very high. He failed, however, to make a great impression on his first visit to England and America, though his audiences were compelled to admire his marvelous technical feats, especially his left hand pizzicato, and rapid runs in thirds and tenths. His less than impeccable intonation, however, somewhat limited his success; he also suffered from having worn the end of his first finger down to the nerve.

In his later years, Burmester had remedied these defects, and those who heard him play at his later concerts were much impressed with his sterling musical qualities.

Jean Sibelius originally dedicated his Violin Concerto to Burmester, who promised to play the concerto in Berlin. For financial reasons, Sibelius decided to premiere it in Helsinki in 1904, and since Burmester was unavailable to travel to Finland, Sibelius engaged Viktor Nováček, a violin teacher at the Helsinki Conservatory. The premiere performance was a disaster. Sibelius revised the work and the new version premiered in 1905. Willy Burmester was again asked to be the soloist, but he was again unavailable, so the performance went ahead without him, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra&#x27;s leader Karel Halíř stepping into the soloist&#x27;s shoes. Burmester was so offended that he refused ever to play the concerto, and Sibelius re-dedicated it to the Hungarian &quot;wunderkind&quot; Ferenc von Vecsey.

<doc id="528472" wikidata="Q1055962" url="?curid=528472" title="Frankenweenie (1984 film)">
<text>Frankenweenie is a 1984 American science fiction comedy horror featurette directed by Tim Burton and written by him and Leonard Ripps. It is both a parody of, and homage to, the 1931 film &quot;Frankenstein&quot; based on Mary Shelley&#x27;s 1818 novel &quot;Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus&quot;. Burton later directed a feature-length stop-motion animated remake, released in 2012.

== Plot ==
Victor Frankenstein is a young boy who creates movies starring his pet Bull Terrier Sparky. After Sparky is hit by a car and killed, Victor learns at school about electrical impulses in muscles and is inspired to bring his pet back to life. He creates elaborate machines in his attic which brings down a bolt of lightning that revives the dog. Victor is pleased, but one day Sparky sneaks out of the house and frightens the Frankensteins&#x27; neighbors. Although they do not get a clear look at Sparky, they determine that some sort of creature is dwelling in the Frankenstein home and grow suspicious of the family. Victor&#x27;s parents discover the revived Sparky, and eventually decide to introduce him to the neighbors in order to quell their suspicions and rumors. However, the arranged introduction ends in chaos as the neighbors recognize Sparky as the creature and fly into a panic.

Sparky runs away, with Victor in pursuit. They find themselves at an abandoned miniature golf course and hide in its flagship windmill. The Frankensteins&#x27; neighbors, now an angry mob, arrive on the scene, and when they attempt to use a cigarette lighter to try to see into the windmill, it is accidentally set on fire. Victor falls and is knocked out, but Sparky rescues him from the flames, only to be crushed by the burning windmill. The neighbors, realizing their error, use their cars and jumper cables to &quot;recharge&quot; Sparky. He is revived, and all celebrate. Sparky falls in love with a poodle whose fur bears a strong resemblance to the hairdo of the Bride of Frankenstein.

== Home media ==
This short was included in the Special Edition, Collector&#x27;s Edition, and Blu-ray 3D releases of &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; and on the Blu-ray release of its remake.

== Controversy ==
Burton was fired by Disney after the film was completed, as the studio claimed that he had been wasting company resources and felt the film was not suitable for the targeted young audiences. The short was originally planned to be released alongside the summer re-release of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, but its release was rescheduled with the Christmas re-release of &quot;Pinocchio&quot; on December 21, 1984. Although the film was subsequently shelved, the film played in UK cinemas in 1985 in front of Touchstone Films&#x27; &quot;&quot;. Following the success of Burton&#x27;s later films &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, and &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;, the film was given a home video release in 1992. It was released as an extra, along with &quot;Vincent&quot;, on &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; DVD, Blu-ray and UMD, as well as the 2000 VHS.

== Remake ==

Disney and Tim Burton produced a full-length remake using stop motion animation, which was released on October 5, 2012 in Disney Digital 3D and IMAX 3D. The original film is included as a bonus feature on the Blu-ray home video release.

<doc id="528473" wikidata="Q905142" url="?curid=528473" title="Joseph Hardy Neesima">
<text>(born ; 12 February 1843 – 23 January 1890), better known by his English name Joseph Hardy Neesima, was a Japanese Protestant missionary and educator of the Meiji era who founded Doshisha English School (later Doshisha University).

He was the husband of Yamamoto Yaeko, a former soldier and nurse who served during the Boshin War, Russo-Japanese and Sino-Japanese War, who later founded Doshisha Girls&#x27; School.

==Early life==
He was born in Edo (present-day Tokyo), the son of a retainer of the Itakura clan of Annaka. His childhood name was . He attended Tokugawa Naval School from 1861.

In 1864, laws on national isolation were still in effect in Japan, and Japanese people were not permitted to travel overseas without government permission. However, Niijima had read extensively on various rangaku topics, and was determined to come to America. At the age of 21, he entreated Captain William T. Savory, of Salem, Massachusetts, commander of the brig &quot;Berlin&quot;, for safe passage to the United States, in order to further study Western science and Christianity. Captain Savory agreed to help him, so long as Niijima came on board at night, without assistance from the ship&#x27;s crew. Knowing Niijima could be executed if apprehended, Savory hid him from customs officials in his stateroom. He then secured Niijima&#x27;s passage from China to the United States on the &quot;Wild Rover&quot;, commanded by Captain Horace Taylor of Chatham, Massachusetts. The &quot;Wild Rover&quot; was owned by Alpheus Hardy.

==In the United States==
When he arrived in Andover, Massachusetts, he was sponsored by Alpheus and Susan Hardy, members of the Old South Church in Boston, who also saw to his education. He attended Phillips Academy under the name of Joseph Hardy Neesima from 1865 to 1867 and then Amherst College, where he was greatly influenced by professor Julius Seelye, from 1867 to 1870. Upon graduating from Amherst, Neesima became the first Japanese person to receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

He was baptized in 1866 and went on to study at Andover Theological Seminary in 1870.

When the Iwakura Mission visited the United States in 1871 on its around-the-world expedition, Neesima assisted as an interpreter. He traveled with the Mission for more than a year, in Europe and the United States. Those who accompanied Neesima on the mission included vice-president of the voyage, Takayoshi Kido and Commissioner of the Educational Bureau, Fujimaro Tanaka, two individuals whom Neesima claimed supported him during the process of creating his school. While in Europe and the United States, Neesima toured the schools there and became influenced by the western education system.

On his return, he completed his studies at Andover Theological Seminary, and in 1874, he became the first Japanese to be ordained by Rev. A.C. Thompson on Thursday, September 24 at Mount Vernon Church, Boston as a Protestant Minister. In the same year, Neesima attended the 65th annual meeting of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missionaries at a Congregational church on Friday, October 9 held in Rutland, Vermont, and made an appeal for funds to start a Christian college in Japan.

==Return to Japan==

Before returning to Japan, Neesima gave a speech at the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions meeting in which he asked the attendees for donations for his school he planned to build, leaving with an estimated $5,000. With the support and funding he received, he returned to Japan, and in 1875 founded a school Doshisha Eigakko (Doshisha English School) in Kyoto, which later grew rapidly and became Doshisha University in 1920. Originally a school for boys, a Doshisha School for girls was soon established in 1877. He was assisted by his wife Yamamoto Yaeko and brother-in-law Yamamoto Kakuma, who were also active with the local Christian community in Kyoto. With the Christian faith at the basis of Doshisha&#x27;s teachings, Neesima claimed as translated, &quot;We placed Christianity at the core of the fundamentals of moral education, believing our ideal education can be achieved only by Christian moral teachings, which include devout faith, pursuit of truth and compassion for others.&quot; Doshisha University is regarded as the first ever Christian school of higher education in Japan.
He died in 1890, at age 46, in Oiso, Kanagawa Prefecture, and was buried in Doshisha Cemetery, Kyoto.

==Honors==
In 1889, Amherst College honored him with an honorary doctorate, the first ever awarded to a Japanese person.

In 1907, he was honored as one of six great educators of the Meiji period, before the assembly of educators of the entire nation held by the Imperial education conference, the education conference of Tokyo prefecture and the Tokyo city board of education.

He was honored on a Japanese postage stamp in 1950.

In his honour, was founded. It is a private junior college in Takasaki, Gunma, Japan. Similarly, there is Niijima Gakuen Junior and Senior High School, which has close links to Doshisha University

<doc id="528474" wikidata="Q855739" url="?curid=528474" title="Womb Realm">
<text>In Vajrayana Buddhism, the Womb Realm (, Traditional Chinese: 胎蔵界; Pinyin: &quot;Tāizāngjiè&quot;; Rōmaji: &quot;taizōkai&quot;) is the metaphysical space inhabited by the Five Compassion Buddhas. The Womb Realm is based on the &quot;Mahavairocana Tantra&quot;. The name of the mandala derives from chapter 2 of the sutra, where it is said that the buddha Mahāvairocana revealed the mandala&#x27;s secret teachings to his disciple Vajrasattva from his &quot;womb of compassion&quot;. In other translations, the term Matrix Realm or Matrix Mandala is used.

The Womb Realm is a very popular subject for mandalas, and along with the Diamond Realm (&quot;vajradhātu&quot;) Mandala forms the Mandala of the Two Realms. This mandala, along with the Diamond Realm, form the core of Chinese Tangmi and Japanese Tendai and Shingon Buddhist rituals, including abhisheka &quot;initiation&quot;. In this ritual, new initiates are blindfolded and asked to toss a flower upon a mandala. Where the flower lands helps decide which Buddhist figure the student should devote themselves to.

In traditional Tangmi and Shingon halls, the Womb Realm Mandala is hung on the east wall, symbolizing the young stage of Mahāvairocana. In this setting, the Diamond Realm Mandala is hung on the west wall symbolizing the final realization of Mahāvairocana.

== Womb Realm map ==
The following is a basic outline of the main halls or quarters of the Womb Realm Mandala:

=== Center Eight Petal Hall ===

Vairocana is depicted in regal attire wearing a jewelled crown in the center of an eight-petaled lotus. Four Buddhas, representing the four directions, are depicted directly above, below, left, and right of Vairocana. The Buddha of the East, Ratnaketu, is illustrated on the top, the Buddha of the South, Samkusumita-raja to the right, the Buddha of the West, Amitabha, to the bottom, and the Buddha of the North, Divyadundubhimeganirghoṣa (Amoghasiddhi), to the Left. Four bodhisattvas, Samantabhadra, Manjushri, Guanyin, and Maitreya, are illustrated between the Buddhas, clockwise.

Vajras are illustrated between the petals of nine deities and symbolize the knowledge or wisdom (jnana) that crush illusions.

Four vases containing a lotus and a three-pronged Vajra, are placed at the corners of the Center Hall. The hall is marked off by a five-colored boundary path with each color referring to one of the five buddhas, knowledges, directions, roots, conversions, syllables, elements, and forms.

<doc id="528477" wikidata="Q236438" url="?curid=528477" title="Cécile Chaminade">
<text>Cécile Louise Stéphanie Chaminade (8 August 1857 – 13 April 1944) was a French composer and pianist. In 1913, she was awarded the Légion d&#x27;Honneur, a first for a female composer. Ambroise Thomas said, &quot;This is not a woman who composes, but a composer who is a woman.&quot;

==Biography==
Born in Batignolles (a village then outside Paris), Chaminade was raised in a musical family. She received her first piano lessons from her mother. Around age 10, Chaminade was assessed by Félix Le Couppey of the Conservatoire de Paris, who recommended that she study music at the Conservatoire. Her father forbade it because he believed it was improper for a girl of Chaminade&#x27;s class. Her father did, however, allow Chaminade to study privately with teachers from the Conservatoire: piano with Le Couppey, violin with Martin Pierre Marsick, and music composition with Marie Gabriel Augustin Savard and Benjamin Godard.
Chaminade experimented in composition as a young child, composing pieces for her cats, dogs and dolls. In 1869, she performed some of her music for Georges Bizet, who was impressed with her talents. In 1878, Chaminade gave a salon performance under the auspices of her professor, Le Couppey, consisting entirely of her compositions. This performance marked the beginning of her emergence as a composer and became the archetype for the concerts she gave for the rest of her career in which she only performed her own works.

During the 1870s and 1880s several of her works were programmed by the prestigious Société nationale de musique. In her early years, she gave recitals throughout France, Switzerland, Belgium and Holland. In 1892, she debuted in England, where her work was popular. Isidor Philipp, head of the piano department at the Conservatoire de Paris, championed her works. She repeatedly returned to England in the 1890s, premiering her compositions with such singers as Blanche Marchesi and Pol Plançon. She visited England again in 1907 and performed at the Aeolian Hall in London, and in Bath. Queen Victoria was known to enjoy Chaminade&#x27;s music and in 1901 at her funeral, the Prélude for organ, Op.78, by Chaminade was played.

Chaminade married a music publisher from Marseille, Louis-Mathieu Carbonel, in 1901. Given his advanced age, it was rumored to be a convenience and Chaminade prescribed strict marriage conditions: they were to live separately (he in Marseille and she near Paris) and their marriage was to remain platonic. Carbonel died in 1907 from a lung disease. Chaminade never remarried.

In 1908, she performed concerts in twelve cities in the United States. Her compositions were tremendous favorites with the American public, and such pieces as the &quot;Scarf Dance&quot; or the &quot;Ballet No. 1&quot; were to be found in the music libraries of many lovers of piano music of the time. She composed a Konzertstück for piano and orchestra, the ballet music to &quot;Callirhoé&quot; and other orchestral works. Her songs, such as &quot;The Silver Ring&quot; and &quot;Ritournelle&quot;, were also great favorites. Ambroise Thomas once said of Chaminade: &quot;This is not a woman who composes, but a composer who is a woman.&quot;

Chaminade was the recipient of numerous honours, both in France and abroad. In 1888 and 1892, she was honoured by the Académie Française. In 1897, she was honoured by Queen Victoria and given the Jubilee Medal. She received the Laurel Wreath from the Athens Conservatory and the Order of the Chefakat by Sultan Abdul Hamid II of the Ottoman Empire. In 1913, she was elected a &quot;Chevalier&quot; of the National Order of the Legion of Honour (French: &quot;Ordre national de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;), a first for a female composer.

In London in November 1901, she made gramophone recordings of seven of her compositions for the Gramophone and Typewriter Company; these are among the most sought-after piano recordings by collectors, though they have been reissued on compact disk. Before and after World War I, Chaminade recorded many piano rolls, but as she grew older, she composed less and less, dying in Monte Carlo on 13 April 1944, where she was first buried. Chaminade is now buried in Passy Cemetery in Paris.

Chaminade was relegated to obscurity for the second half of the 20th century, her piano pieces and songs mostly forgotten, with the exception being the Flute Concertino in D major, Op. 107, composed for the 1902 Paris Conservatoire Concours; it is her most popular piece today.

Chaminade&#x27;s sister married Moritz Moszkowski, also a well-known composer and pianist like Cécile.

==Critical reception==
Many of Chaminade&#x27;s piano compositions received good reviews from critics, some of her other endeavors and more serious works were less favourably evaluated, perhaps on account of gender prejudices. Most of her compositions were published during her lifetime and were financially successful.

==Compositional style==
Chaminade affiliated herself with nationalist composers such as Camille Saint-Saëns and Charles Gounod. Her musical style was rooted in both Romantic and French tradition throughout her career and her music has been described as tuneful, highly accessible and mildly chromatic. In describing her own style, Chaminade wrote, &quot;I am essentially of the Romantic school, as all my work shows.&quot;

<text>Frank Heino Damrosch (June 22, 1859 – October 22, 1937) was a German-born American music conductor and educator. In 1905, Damrosch founded the New York Institute of Musical Art, a predecessor of the Juilliard School.

==Life and career==

Damrosch was born on June 22, 1859, in Breslau, Silesia, the son of Helene von Heimburg, a former opera singer, and conductor Leopold Damrosch. He came to the United States with his father, brother, conductor Walter Damrosch, and sister, music teacher Clara Mannes, in 1871. His parents were Lutheran.

He had studied music in Germany under Dionys Pruckner. He studied in New York under Ferdinand von Inten. He also studied in Europe under Moritz Moszkowski. He had originally intended to adopt a business career, and to that end went to Denver, Colorado, but the musical impulse proved too strong, and, in 1884, he was an organist, conductor of the Denver Chorus Club, and supervisor of music in the public schools.

For some years he was chorus master at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. He also conducted the Mendelssohn Glee Club from 1885 to 1887. In 1892, he organized the People&#x27;s Singing Classes, and he was also instrumental in founding the Musical Art Society of New York.

In 1897, he became supervisor of music in the public schools in New York. In 1898 Damrosch succeeded his brother Walter as conductor of the Oratorio Society, which he directed until 1912. During his career, he and his sister Clara Damrosch also taught at the Veltin School for Girls in Manhattan.

In 1905, he founded and became director of the New York Institute of Musical Art, with the hopes of reproducing the quality of instruction found in European conservatories. In 1926, the Institute of Musical Art merged with the Juilliard Graduate School to form what is today Juilliard School. Damrosch&#x27;s pupils included William Howland, long-time head of the music department at the University of Michigan, and the prodigy pianist Hazel Scott.

Damrosch died in New York City on October 22, 1937, aged 78. Damrosch Park, part of New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, is named in honor of the Damrosch family.

<doc id="528488" wikidata="Q1686926" url="?curid=528488" title="Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge">
<text>Janet Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge, PC LLD HonFRA (3 November 1904 – 16 November 1988), known as Jennie Lee, was a Scottish politician. She was a Labour Member of Parliament from a by-election in 1929 until 1931 and then from 1945 to 1970.

As Minister for the Arts in Harold Wilson&#x27;s government of 1964–1970, she played a leading role in the foundation of the Open University working directly with Harold Wilson to establish the principle of open access: &quot;Enrolment as a student of the University should be open to everyone … irrespective of educational qualifications, and no formal entrance requirement should be imposed.&quot;

She was married to the Welsh Labour politician Aneurin Bevan from 1934 until his death in 1960.

==Early life==
Born in Lochgelly, in Fife, to Euphemia Greig and James Lee, a miner who held the post of fire and safety officer, and later a hotelier. She had a younger brother, Tommy.

She inherited her father&#x27;s socialist inclinations, and like him joined the Scottish Independent Labour Party (ILP). Her grandfather Michael Lee, born in 1850 to Irish Catholic parents, was a friend of Keir Hardie, a disputes secretary of the miners&#x27; union and founder of the Fifeshire ILP federation. She later joined the Labour Party, and served as an MP from 1929 to 1931 and from 1945 to 1970.

==Education==
Lee was educated at Beath High School and was dux of the school in her final year. The Carnegie Trust, Fife County Council and the Fife Education Authority agreed to pay her university fees and she attended the University of Edinburgh as a student teacher. She later won a bursary to study law.

At university she joined the Labour Club, the Edinburgh University Women&#x27;s Union and the editorial board of the student newspaper. One of her first campaigns was to elect Bertrand Russell as Rector of the University. After graduating initially in 1927 with an MA, an LLB and a teaching certificate, she worked as a teacher in Cowdenbeath.

== First term as MP ==
Lee was adopted as the ILP candidate for the North Lanarkshire constituency, which she won at a 1929 by-election, becoming the youngest woman member of the House of Commons. At the time of the by-election, women under the age of 30 were not yet able to vote. Her victory meant that she became the first Labour woman to represent a Scottish seat in the House of Commons. She was re-elected at the subsequent 1929 general election.

In Westminster she immediately came into conflict with the Labour Party&#x27;s leadership in the Commons. She insisted on being sponsored by Robert Smillie and her old friend James Maxton to be introduced to the Commons, rather than by the leadership&#x27;s preferred choice of sponsors. Lee also associated with Ellen Wilkinson.

Lee&#x27;s first speech was an attack on the budget proposals of Winston Churchill (accusing him &quot;of &#x27;cant, corruption, and incompetence&#x27;, her gestures more fitting to the storming of platforms than the measured tones expected from a young MP in the house&quot;) that met even with his approval, with him offering his congratulations after their exchange in the Commons. Lee forged a parliamentary reputation as a left-winger, allying herself to Maxton and the other ILP members. She was totally opposed to Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s decision to form a coalition National Government, and in the 1931 general election lost her seat in parliament to Unionist candidate William Anstruther-Gray.

==Out of the Commons==
In her private life at the time she had formed a close relationship with fellow Labour MP Edward Frank Wise, a married man who considered divorcing his wife for Lee, but who did not do so in the end. Wise died in 1933 and the following year Lee married the left-wing Welsh Labour MP Aneurin Bevan, with whom she remained until his death in 1960. Her biography suggests that she to some extent suppressed her own career after marriage, which &#x27;was the more remarkable precisely because as a woman in politics she had always laid claim to a &#x27;male&#x27; life, public, itinerant and unencumbered by family responsibilities&#x27;. She had no history in the women&#x27;s movement, did not align herself with the separate women&#x27;s branches within the Labour Party and stated that she voted on policy not candidate gender, believing that equality for women would follow from the introduction of true socialism; it was not a separate cause. Nonetheless she practised feminism &#x27;of a sort&#x27; and was known to walk out of dinner parties if it was expected that women were to withdraw to another room when the port was circulated.

Despite being out of the Commons Lee remained active politically, trying to secure British support for the Spanish Popular Front government under threat from Francisco Franco&#x27;s Nationalist faction in the Spanish Civil War. She also remained active inside the ILP and took their side in their split from the Labour Party, a decision that did not meet with her husband&#x27;s approval. She attempted re-election in North Lanarkshire at the 1935 general election, coming second behind Anstruther-Gray but ahead of the Labour Party&#x27;s candidate. Attending the Labour Party Conference in Edinburgh in 1936, Lee met the Spanish Republican delegates who attended with a petition for support against the fascists, including meeting with Isabel de Valencia, who had a Scottish mother. Lee went to Spain herself in 1937 to report as a war journalist. She travelled in Aragon and Barcelona with George Orwell and the teenage grandson of her Commons sponsor, Robert Smillie, MP, while reporting for &quot;New Leader&quot; and they were all caught up in some violent incidents. Young Bob died a year later in a Communist prison. Lee attended a torchlit parade of the British Battalion of the International Brigades volunteers at Modejar with Clement Attlee and others in the Labour Party, during the war.

She was again unsuccessful in seeking re-election as an &quot;Independent Labour&quot; candidate in a 1943 by-election at Bristol Central, being defeated by the Conservative Lady Apsley and opposed by the ILP. She also worked as a journalist for the Daily Mirror.

==Re-election==
She later returned to the Labour Party from the ILP, and at the 1945 general election she was once again elected to the Commons, this time to represent the Cannock constituency in Staffordshire. She remained a convinced left-winger, and this brought her sometimes into opposition with her husband, with whom she usually agreed politically. Lee was critical of Bevan for his support of the UK acquiring a nuclear deterrent, something she did not support.

She was appointed as the first Minister for the Arts in Harold Wilson&#x27;s government of 1964, and played a key role in the formation of the Open University, an act described by Wilson as the greatest of his time in government.

==Role in the foundation of the Open University==
The Open University was based on the idea of a &#x27;University of the Air&#x27;. It was intended as a correspondence university reaching out to those who had been denied the opportunity to study. Lee produced a white paper in 1966, outlining university plans which would deliver courses by correspondence and broadcasting as teaching media. Prime Minister Harold Wilson was an enthusiastic supporter because he envisioned The Open University as a major marker in the Labour Party&#x27;s commitment to modernising British society. He believed that it would help build a more competitive economy while also promoting greater equality of opportunity and social mobility. The planned utilisation of television and radio to broadcast its courses was also supposed to link The Open University to the technological revolution underway, which Wilson saw as a major ally of his modernisation schemes. However, from the start, Lee encountered widespread scepticism and even opposition from within and without the Labour Party, including senior officials in the DES; her departmental boss, Anthony Crosland; the Treasury; Ministerial colleagues, such as Richard Crossman; and commercial broadcasters. The Open University was realised due to Lee&#x27;s unflagging determination and tenacity in 1965–67, the steadfast support from Wilson, and the fact that the anticipated costs, as reported to Lee and Wilson by Arnold Goodman, seemed very modest. By the time the actual, much higher costs became apparent, it was too late to scrap the fledgling Open University.

The university was granted its Royal Charter by the Privy Council on 23 April 1969. Applications opened in 1970 and the first students began their studies in 1971.

In 1973, as she laid the foundation stone for the first Open University library, she described the University as &#x27;a great independent university which does not insult any man or any women whatever their background by offering them the second best, nothing but the best is good enough.&#x27;

==Role in the expansion of the Arts Council==

Lee renewed the charter of the Arts Council of Great Britain in 1967, which saw an expansion of its work in the regions, as well of the creation of the new arts institutions at London&#x27;s South Bank Centre. She also introduced the only UK white paper for the Arts to be published for the next half-century, and following the 1967 reshuffle, was promoted to Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science after two years as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State. Between 1964 and 1965, Lee had been Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Public Building and Works.

==Retirement and later life==
Lee was defeated at the 1970 election in Cannock by the Conservative candidate Patrick Cormack. Political scientist Richard Rose called Lee&#x27;s loss of her seat, which had been held by Labour since 1935, on a swing of 10.7%, the largest in any constituency for that election, &quot;the biggest upset&quot; of the 1970 general election. She retired from front-line politics when she was made Baroness Lee of Asheridge, of the City of Westminster on 5 November 1970, Asheridge being the farm near Chesham, Buckinghamshire where she had lived from 1954 to 1968.

She wrote four books: &quot;To-morrow Is a New Day&quot;, 1939; &quot;Our Ally, Russia&quot;, 1941; &quot;This Great Journey&quot;, 1963; &quot;My Life with Nye&quot;, 1980.

In 1974, she received an Honorary LLD from the University of Cambridge, and in 1981 an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Academy.

She died in 1988 from natural causes, aged 84, and bequeathed her personal papers to the Open University, which now holds them as the Jennie Lee Collection.

==Memorials==

A community resource centre in Wednesfield, which formed part of Lee&#x27;s Cannock constituency, was named the &quot;Jennie Lee Centre&quot; in her honour. It opened in a former secondary school in 1989, the year after Lee&#x27;s death, and closed in 2013.

In 2005, the Students&#x27; Association of the newly created Adam Smith College in Kirkcaldy, Fife refused to name themselves after Adam Smith, and instead chose the name &quot;Jennie Lee Students&#x27; Association&quot;. The Association claimed Adam Smith is synonymous with &quot;exploitation and greed&quot; and stated &quot;Jennie Lee would be an excellent role model for the students because of the courage and conviction she showed in achieving the aims she believed passionately in&quot;.

<doc id="528491" wikidata="Q278770" url="?curid=528491" title="Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory">
<text>In the foundations of mathematics, von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory (NBG) is an axiomatic set theory that is a conservative extension of Zermelo–Fraenkel–choice set theory (ZFC). NBG introduces the notion of class, which is a collection of sets defined by a formula whose quantifiers range only over sets. NBG can define classes that are larger than sets, such as the class of all sets and the class of all ordinals. Morse–Kelley set theory (MK) allows classes to be defined by formulas whose quantifiers range over classes. NBG is finitely axiomatizable, while ZFC and MK are not.

A key theorem of NBG is the class existence theorem, which states that for every formula whose quantifiers range only over sets, there is a class consisting of the sets satisfying the formula. This class is built by mirroring the step-by-step construction of the formula with classes. Since all set-theoretic formulas are constructed from two kinds of atomic formulas (membership and equality) and finitely many logical symbols, only finitely many axioms are needed to build the classes satisfying them. This is why NBG is finitely axiomatizable. Classes are also used for other constructions, for handling the set-theoretic paradoxes, and for stating the axiom of global choice, which is stronger than ZFC&#x27;s axiom of choice.

John von Neumann introduced classes into set theory in 1925. The primitive notions of his theory were function and argument. Using these notions, he defined class and set. Paul Bernays reformulated von Neumann&#x27;s theory by taking class and set as primitive notions. Kurt Gödel simplified Bernays&#x27; theory for his relative consistency proof of the axiom of choice and the generalized continuum hypothesis.

== Classes in set theory ==
=== The uses of classes ===
Classes have several uses in NBG:
* They produce a finite axiomatization of set theory.
* They are used to state a &quot;very strong form of the axiom of choice&quot;—namely, the axiom of global choice: There exists a global choice function formula_1 defined on the class of all nonempty sets such that formula_2 for every nonempty set formula_3 This is stronger than ZFC&#x27;s axiom of choice: For every set formula_4 of nonempty sets, there exists a choice function formula_5 defined on formula_4 such that formula_7 for all formula_8
* The set-theoretic paradoxes are handled by recognizing that some classes cannot be sets. For example, assume that the class formula_9 of all ordinals is a set. Then formula_9 is a transitive set well-ordered by formula_11. So, by definition, formula_9 is an ordinal. Hence, formula_13, which contradicts formula_11 being a well-ordering of formula_15 Therefore, formula_9 is not a set. A class that is not a set is called a proper class; formula_9 is a proper class.
* Proper classes are useful in constructions. In his proof of the relative consistency of the axiom of global choice and the generalized continuum hypothesis, Gödel used proper classes to build the constructible universe. He constructed a function on the class of all ordinals that, for each ordinal, builds a constructible set by applying a set-building operation to previously constructed sets. The constructible universe is the image of this function.

=== Axiom schema versus class existence theorem ===
Once classes are added to the language of ZFC, it is easy to transform ZFC into a set theory with classes. First, the axiom schema of class comprehension is added. This axiom schema states: For every formula formula_18 that quantifies only over sets, there exists a class formula_19 consisting of the satisfying the formula—that is, formula_20 Then the axiom schema of replacement is replaced by a single axiom that uses a class. Finally, ZFC&#x27;s axiom of extensionality is modified to handle classes: If two classes have the same elements, then they are identical. The other axioms of ZFC are not modified.

This theory is not finitely axiomatized. ZFC&#x27;s replacement schema has been replaced by a single axiom, but the axiom schema of class comprehension has been introduced.

To produce a theory with finitely many axioms, the axiom schema of class comprehension is first replaced with finitely many class existence axioms. Then these axioms are used to prove the class existence theorem, which implies every instance of the axiom schema. The proof of this theorem requires only seven class existence axioms, which are used to convert the construction of a formula into the construction of a class satisfying the formula.

== Axiomatization of NBG ==
=== Classes and sets ===
NBG has two types of objects: classes and sets. Intuitively, every set is also a class. There are two ways to axiomatize this. Bernays used many-sorted logic with two sorts: classes and sets. Gödel avoided sorts by introducing primitive predicates: formula_21 for &quot;formula_19 is a class&quot; and formula_23 for &quot;formula_19 is a set&quot; (in German, &quot;set&quot; is &quot;Menge&quot;). He also introduced axioms stating that every set is a class and that if class formula_19 is a member of a class, then formula_19 is a set. Using predicates is the standard way to eliminate sorts. Elliott Mendelson modified Gödel&#x27;s approach by having everything be a class and defining the set predicate formula_27 as formula_28 This modification eliminates Gödel&#x27;s class predicate and his two axioms.

Bernays&#x27; two-sorted approach may appear more natural at first, but it creates a more complex theory. In Bernays&#x27; theory, every set has two representations: one as a set and the other as a class. Also, there are two membership relations: the first, denoted by &quot;∈&quot;, is between two sets; the second, denoted by &quot;η&quot;, is between a set and a class. This redundancy is required by many-sorted logic because variables of different sorts range over disjoint subdomains of the domain of discourse.

The differences between these two approaches do not affect what can be proved, but they do affect how statements are written. In Gödel&#x27;s approach, formula_29 where formula_19 and formula_31 are classes is a valid statement. In Bernays&#x27; approach this statement has no meaning. However, if formula_19 is a set, there is an equivalent statement: Define &quot;set formula_33 represents class formula_19&quot; if they have the same sets as members—that is, formula_35 The statement formula_36 where set formula_33 represents class formula_19 is equivalent to Gödel&#x27;s formula_39

The approach adopted in this article is that of Gödel with Mendelson&#x27;s modification. This means that NBG is an axiomatic system in first-order predicate logic with equality, and its only primitive notions are class and the membership relation.

=== Definitions and axioms of extensionality and pairing ===
A set is a class that belongs to at least one class: formula_19 is a set if and only if formula_41.
A class that is not a set is called a proper class: formula_19 is a proper class if and only if formula_43.
Therefore, every class is either a set or a proper class, and no class is both.

Gödel introduced the convention that uppercase variables range over classes, while lowercase variables range over sets. Gödel also used names that begin with an uppercase letter to denote particular classes, including functions and relations defined on the class of all sets. Gödel&#x27;s convention is used in this article. It allows us to write:

* formula_44 instead of formula_45
* formula_46 instead of formula_47
The following axioms and definitions are needed for the proof of the class existence theorem.

Axiom of extensionality. If two classes have the same elements, then they are identical.
:formula_48

This axiom generalizes ZFC&#x27;s axiom of extensionality to classes.

Axiom of pairing. If formula_49 and formula_50 are sets, then there exists a set formula_51 whose only members are formula_49 and formula_50.
:formula_54

As in ZFC, the axiom of extensionality implies the uniqueness of the set formula_51, which allows us to introduce the notation formula_56

Ordered pairs are defined by: 
:formula_57
Tuples are defined inductively using ordered pairs:
:formula_58
:formula_59

=== Class existence axioms and axiom of regularity ===
Class existence axioms will be used to prove the class existence theorem: For every formula in formula_60 free set variables that quantifies only over sets, there exists a class of that satisfy it. The following example starts with two classes that are functions and builds a composite function. This example illustrates the techniques that are needed to prove the class existence theorem, which lead to the class existence axioms that are needed.
:

The class existence axioms are divided into two groups: axioms handling language primitives and axioms handling tuples. There are four axioms in the first group and three axioms in the second group.

Axioms for handling language primitives:

Membership. There exists a class formula_61 containing all the ordered pairs whose first component is a member of the second component.
:formula_62

Intersection (conjunction). For any two classes formula_19 and formula_64, there is a class formula_31 consisting precisely of the sets that belong to both formula_19 and formula_64.
:formula_68

Complement (negation). For any class formula_19, there is a class formula_64 consisting precisely of the sets not belonging to formula_19.
:formula_72

Domain (existential quantifier). For any class formula_19, there is a class formula_64 consisting precisely of the first components of the ordered pairs of formula_19. 
:formula_76

By the axiom of extensionality, class formula_31 in the intersection axiom and class formula_64 in the complement and domain axioms are unique. They will be denoted by: formula_79 formula_80 and formula_81 respectively.

The first three axioms imply the existence of the empty class and the class of all sets: The membership axiom implies the existence of a class formula_82 The intersection and complement axioms imply the existence of formula_83, which is empty. By the axiom of extensionality, this class is unique; it is denoted by formula_84 The complement of formula_85 is the class formula_86 of all sets, which is also unique by extensionality. The set predicate formula_27, which was defined as formula_88, is now redefined as formula_89 to avoid quantifying over classes.

Axioms for handling tuples:

Product by formula_86. For any class formula_19, there is a class formula_64 consisting of the ordered pairs whose first component belongs to formula_19. 
:formula_94

Circular permutation. For any class formula_19, there is a class formula_64 whose 3tuples are obtained by applying the circular permutation formula_97 to the 3tuples of formula_19.
:formula_99

Transposition. For any class formula_19, there is a class formula_64 whose 3tuples are obtained by transposing the last two components of the 3tuples of formula_19.
:formula_103

By extensionality, the product by formula_86 axiom implies the existence of a unique class, which is denoted by formula_105 This axiom is used to define the class formula_106 of all : formula_107 and formula_108 If formula_19 is a class, extensionality implies that formula_110 is the unique class consisting of the of formula_111 For example, the membership axiom produces a class formula_61 that may contain elements that are not ordered pairs, while the intersection formula_113 contains only the ordered pairs of formula_61.

The circular permutation and transposition axioms do not imply the existence of unique classes because they specify only the 3tuples of class formula_115 By specifying the 3tuples, these axioms also specify the for formula_116 since: formula_117 The axioms for handling tuples and the domain axiom imply the following lemma, which is used in the proof of the class existence theorem.


One more axiom is needed to prove the class existence theorem: the axiom of regularity. Since the existence of the empty class has been proved, the usual statement of this axiom is given.

Axiom of regularity. Every nonempty set has at least one element with which it has no element in common.
formula_118

This axiom implies that a set cannot belong to itself: Assume that formula_119 and let formula_120 Then formula_121 since formula_122 This contradicts the axiom of regularity because formula_49 is the only element in formula_124 Therefore, formula_125 The axiom of regularity also prohibits infinite descending membership sequences of sets: formula_126

Gödel stated regularity for classes rather than for sets in his 1940 monograph, which was based on lectures given in 1938. In 1939, he proved that regularity for sets implies regularity for classes.

=== Class existence theorem ===

The theorem&#x27;s proof will be done in two steps:
# Transformation rules are used to transform the given formula formula_127 into an equivalent formula that simplifies the inductive part of the proof. For example, the only logical symbols in the transformed formula are formula_128, formula_129, and formula_130, so the induction handles logical symbols with just three cases. 
# The class existence theorem is proved inductively for transformed formulas. Guided by the structure of the transformed formula, the class existence axioms are used to produce the unique class of satisfying the formula.

Transformation rules. In rules 1 and 2 below, formula_131 and formula_132 denote set or class variables. These two rules eliminate all occurrences of class variables before an formula_11 and all occurrences of equality. Each time rule 1 or 2 is applied to a subformula, formula_134 is chosen so that formula_135 differs from the other variables in the current formula. The three rules are repeated until there are no subformulas to which they can be applied. This produces a formula that is built only with formula_128, formula_129, formula_130, formula_11, set variables, and class variables formula_140 where formula_140 does not appear before an formula_11.

# formula_143 is transformed into formula_144
# Extensionality is used to transform formula_145 into formula_146 
# Logical identities are used to transform subformulas containing formula_147 and formula_148 to subformulas that only use formula_149 and formula_150

Transformation rules: bound variables. Consider the composite function formula of example 1 with its free set variables replaced by formula_151 and formula_152: formula_153 The inductive proof will remove formula_154, which produces the formula formula_155 However, since the class existence theorem is stated for subscripted variables, this formula does not have the form expected by the induction hypothesis. This problem is solved by replacing the variable formula_156 with formula_157 Bound variables within nested quantifiers are handled by increasing the subscript by one for each successive quantifier. This leads to rule 4, which must be applied after the other rules since rules 1 and 2 produce quantified variables.


Proof of the class existence theorem. The proof starts by applying the transformation rules to the given formula to produce a transformed formula. Since this formula is equivalent to the given formula, the proof is completed by proving the class existence theorem for transformed formulas.

Gödel pointed out that the class existence theorem &quot;is a metatheorem, that is, a theorem about the system [NBG], not in the system …&quot; It is a theorem about NBG because it is proved in the metatheory by induction on NBG formulas. Also, its proof—instead of invoking finitely many NBG axioms—inductively describes how to use NBG axioms to construct a class satisfying a given formula. For every formula, this description can be turned into a constructive existence proof that is in NBG. Therefore, this metatheorem can generate the NBG proofs that replace
uses of NBG&#x27;s class existence theorem.

A recursive computer program succinctly captures the construction of a class from a given formula. The definition of this program does not depend on the proof of the class existence theorem. However, the proof is needed to prove that the class constructed by the program satisfies the given formula and is built using the axioms. This program is written in pseudocode that uses a Pascal-style case statement.
formula_158

Let formula_127 be the formula of example 2. The function call formula_160 generates the class formula_161 which is compared below with formula_162 This shows that the construction of the class formula_19 mirrors the construction of its defining formula formula_162

formula_165

=== Extending the class existence theorem ===
Gödel extended the class existence theorem to formulas formula_127 containing relations over classes (such as formula_167 and the unary relation formula_168), special classes (such as formula_9), and operations (such as formula_170 and formula_171). To extend the class existence theorem, the formulas defining relations, special classes, and operations must quantify only over sets. Then formula_127 can be transformed into an equivalent formula satisfying the hypothesis of the class existence theorem.

The following definitions specify how formulas define relations, special classes, and operations:
# A relation formula_173 is defined by: formula_174
# A special class formula_31 is defined by: formula_176
# An operation formula_177 is defined by: formula_178

A is defined by:
# Variables and special classes are terms.
# If formula_177 is an operation with formula_180 arguments and formula_181 are terms, then formula_182 is a term.

The following transformation rules eliminate relations, special classes, and operations. Each time rule 2b, 3b, or 4 is applied to a subformula, formula_134 is chosen so that formula_135 differs from the other variables in the current formula. The rules are repeated until there are no subformulas to which they can be applied. formula_185 and formula_131 denote terms.

# A relation formula_187 is replaced by its defining formula formula_188
# Let formula_189 be the defining formula for the special class formula_190 
# Let formula_191 be the defining formula for the operation formula_192 
# Extensionality is used to transform formula_145 into formula_146




=== Set axioms ===
The axioms of pairing and regularity, which were needed for the proof of the class existence theorem, have been given above. NBG contains four other set axioms. Three of these axioms deal with class operations being applied to sets.

Definition. formula_195 is a function if formula_196

In set theory, the definition of a function does not require specifying the domain or codomain of the function (see Function (set theory)). NBG&#x27;s definition of function generalizes ZFC&#x27;s definition from a set of ordered pairs to a class of ordered pairs.

ZFC&#x27;s definitions of the set operations of image, union, and power set are also generalized to class operations. The image of class formula_19 under the function formula_195 is formula_199 This definition does not require that formula_200 The union of class formula_19 is formula_202 The power class of formula_19 is formula_204 The extended version of the class existence theorem implies the existence of these classes. The axioms of replacement, union, and power set imply that when these operations are applied to sets, they produce sets.

Axiom of replacement. If formula_195 is a function and formula_33 is a set, then formula_207, the image of formula_33 under formula_195, is a set.
formula_210

Not having the requirement formula_211 in the definition of formula_212 produces a stronger axiom of replacement, which is used in the following proof.


Axiom of union. If formula_33 is a set, then there is a set containing formula_214
formula_215

Axiom of power set. If formula_33 is a set, then there is a set containing formula_217
:formula_218


Axiom of infinity. There exists a nonempty set formula_33 such that for all formula_49 in formula_33, there exists a formula_50 in formula_33 such that formula_49 is a proper subset of formula_50.
formula_226

The axioms of infinity and replacement prove the existence of the empty set. In the discussion of the class existence axioms, the existence of the empty class formula_85 was proved. We now prove that formula_85 is a set. Let function formula_229 and let formula_33 be the set given by the axiom of infinity. By replacement, the image of formula_33 under formula_195, which equals formula_85, is a set.

NBG&#x27;s axiom of infinity is implied by ZFC&#x27;s axiom of infinity: formula_234 The first conjunct of ZFC&#x27;s axiom, formula_235, implies the first conjunct of NBG&#x27;s axiom. The second conjunct of ZFC&#x27;s axiom, formula_236, implies the second conjunct of NBG&#x27;s axiom since formula_237 To prove ZFC&#x27;s axiom of infinity from NBG&#x27;s axiom of infinity requires some of the other NBG axioms (see Weak axiom of infinity).

=== Axiom of global choice ===
The class concept allows NBG to have a stronger axiom of choice than ZFC. A choice function is a function formula_5 defined on a set formula_4 of nonempty sets such that formula_7 for all formula_8 ZFC&#x27;s axiom of choice states that there exists a choice function for every set of nonempty sets. A global choice function is a function formula_1 defined on the class of all nonempty sets such that formula_2 for every nonempty set formula_3 The axiom of global choice states that there exists a global choice function. This axiom implies ZFC&#x27;s axiom of choice since for every set formula_4 of nonempty sets, formula_246 (the restriction of formula_1 to formula_4) is a choice function for formula_249 In 1964, William B. Easton proved that global choice is stronger than the axiom of choice by using forcing to construct a model that satisfies the axiom of choice and all the axioms of NBG except the axiom of global choice. The axiom of global choice is equivalent to every class having a well-ordering, while ZFC&#x27;s axiom of choice is equivalent to every set having a well-ordering.

==History==
=== Von Neumann&#x27;s 1925 axiom system ===
Von Neumann published an introductory article on his axiom system in 1925. In 1928, he provided a detailed treatment of his system. Von Neumann based his axiom system on two domains of primitive objects: functions and arguments. These domains overlap—objects that are in both domains are called argument-functions. Functions correspond to classes in NBG, and argument-functions correspond to sets. Von Neumann&#x27;s primitive operation is function application, denoted by [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;x&quot;] rather than &quot;a&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) where &quot;a&quot; is a function and &quot;x&quot; is an argument. This operation produces an argument. Von Neumann defined classes and sets using functions and argument-functions that take only two values, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. He defined &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;a&quot; if [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;x&quot;] ≠ &quot;A&quot;.

Von Neumann&#x27;s work in set theory was influenced by Georg Cantor&#x27;s articles, Ernst Zermelo&#x27;s 1908 axioms for set theory, and the 1922 critiques of Zermelo&#x27;s set theory that were given independently by Abraham Fraenkel and Thoralf Skolem. Both Fraenkel and Skolem pointed out that Zermelo&#x27;s axioms cannot prove the existence of the set {&quot;Z&quot;0, &quot;Z&quot;1, &quot;Z&quot;2, ...} where &quot;Z&quot;0 is the set of natural numbers and &quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 is the power set of &quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot;. They then introduced the axiom of replacement, which would guarantee the existence of such sets. However, they were reluctant to adopt this axiom: Fraenkel stated &quot;that Replacement was too strong an axiom for &#x27;general set theory&#x27;&quot;, while &quot;Skolem only wrote that &#x27;we could introduce&#x27; Replacement&quot;.

Von Neumann worked on the problems of Zermelo set theory and provided solutions for some of them:
* A theory of ordinals 
** Problem: Cantor&#x27;s theory of ordinal numbers cannot be developed in Zermelo set theory because it lacks the axiom of replacement. 
** Solution: Von Neumann recovered Cantor&#x27;s theory by defining the ordinals using sets that are well-ordered by the ∈-relation, and by using the axiom of replacement to prove key theorems about the ordinals, such as every well-ordered set is order-isomorphic with an ordinal. In contrast to Fraenkel and Skolem, von Neumann emphasized how important the replacement axiom is for set theory: &quot;In fact, I believe that no theory of ordinals is possible at all without this axiom.&quot;
* A criterion identifying classes that are too large to be sets 
** Problem: Zermelo did not provide such a criterion. His set theory avoids the large classes that lead to the paradoxes, but it leaves out many sets, such as the one mentioned by Fraenkel and Skolem. 
** Solution: Von Neumann introduced the criterion: A class is too large to be a set if and only if it can be mapped onto the class &quot;V&quot; of all sets. Von Neumann realized that the set-theoretic paradoxes could be avoided by not allowing such large classes to be members of any class. Combining this restriction with his criterion, he obtained his axiom of limitation of size: A class &quot;C&quot; is not a member of any class if and only if &quot;C&quot; can be mapped onto &quot;V&quot;.
* Finite axiomatization 
** Problem: Zermelo had used the imprecise concept of &quot;definite propositional function&quot; in his axiom of separation.
** Solutions: Skolem introduced the axiom schema of separation that was later used in ZFC, and Fraenkel introduced an equivalent solution. However, Zermelo rejected both approaches &quot;particularly because they implicitly involve the concept of natural number which, in Zermelo&#x27;s view, should be based upon set theory.&quot; Von Neumann avoided axiom schemas by formalizing the concept of &quot;definite propositional function&quot; with his functions, whose construction requires only finitely many axioms. This led to his set theory having finitely many axioms. In 1961, Richard Montague proved that ZFC cannot be finitely axiomatized.
* The axiom of regularity 
** Problem: Zermelo set theory starts with the empty set and an infinite set, and iterates the axioms of pairing, union, power set, separation, and choice to generate new sets. However, it does not restrict sets to these. For example, it allows sets that are not well-founded, such as a set &quot;x&quot; satisfying &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;x&quot;. 
** Solutions: Fraenkel introduced an axiom to exclude these sets. Von Neumann analyzed Fraenkel&#x27;s axiom and stated that it was not &quot;precisely formulated&quot;, but it would approximately say: &quot;Besides the sets ... whose existence is absolutely required by the axioms, there are no further sets.&quot; Von Neumann proposed the axiom of regularity as a way to exclude non-well-founded sets, but did not include it in his axiom system. In 1930, Zermelo became the first to publish an axiom system that included regularity.

=== Von Neumann&#x27;s 1929 axiom system ===
In 1929, von Neumann published an article containing the axioms that would lead to NBG. This article was motivated by his concern about the consistency of the axiom of limitation of size. He stated that this axiom &quot;does a lot, actually too much.&quot; Besides implying the axioms of separation and replacement, and the well-ordering theorem, it also implies that any class whose cardinality is less than that of &quot;V&quot; is a set. Von Neumann thought that this last implication went beyond Cantorian set theory and concluded: &quot;We must therefore discuss whether its [the axiom&#x27;s] consistency is not even more problematic than an axiomatization of set theory that does not go beyond the necessary Cantorian framework.&quot;

Von Neumann started his consistency investigation by introducing his 1929 axiom system, which contains all the axioms of his 1925 axiom system except the axiom of limitation of size. He replaced this axiom with two of its consequences, the axiom of replacement and a choice axiom. Von Neumann&#x27;s choice axiom states: &quot;Every relation &quot;R&quot; has a subclass that is a function with the same domain as &quot;R&quot;.&quot;

Let &quot;S&quot; be von Neumann&#x27;s 1929 axiom system. Von Neumann introduced the axiom system &quot;S&quot; + Regularity (which consists of &quot;S&quot; and the axiom of regularity) to demonstrate that his 1925 system is consistent relative to &quot;S&quot;. He proved:
# If &quot;S&quot; is consistent, then &quot;S&quot; + Regularity is consistent.
# &quot;S&quot; + Regularity implies the axiom of limitation of size. Since this is the only axiom of his 1925 axiom system that &quot;S&quot; + Regularity does not have, &quot;S&quot; + Regularity implies all the axioms of his 1925 system. 
These results imply: If &quot;S&quot; is consistent, then von Neumann&#x27;s 1925 axiom system is consistent. Proof: If &quot;S&quot; is consistent, then &quot;S&quot; + Regularity is consistent (result 1). Using proof by contradiction, assume that the 1925 axiom system is inconsistent, or equivalently: the 1925 axiom system implies a contradiction. Since &quot;S&quot; + Regularity implies the axioms of the 1925 system (result 2), &quot;S&quot; + Regularity also implies a contradiction. However, this contradicts the consistency of &quot;S&quot; + Regularity. Therefore, if &quot;S&quot; is consistent, then von Neumann&#x27;s 1925 axiom system is consistent.

Since &quot;S&quot; is his 1929 axiom system, von Neumann&#x27;s 1925 axiom system is consistent relative to his 1929 axiom system, which is closer to Cantorian set theory. The major differences between Cantorian set theory and the 1929 axiom system are classes and von Neumann&#x27;s choice axiom. The axiom system &quot;S&quot; + Regularity was modified by Bernays and Gödel to produce the equivalent NBG axiom system.

=== Bernays&#x27; axiom system ===

In 1929, Paul Bernays started modifying von Neumann&#x27;s new axiom system by taking classes and sets as primitives. He published his work in a series of articles appearing from 1937 to 1954. Bernays stated that:

Bernays handled sets and classes in a two-sorted logic and introduced two membership primitives: one for membership in sets and one for membership in classes. With these primitives, he rewrote and simplified von Neumann&#x27;s 1929 axioms. Bernays also included the axiom of regularity in his axiom system.

=== Gödel&#x27;s axiom system (NBG) ===

In 1931, Bernays sent a letter containing his set theory to Kurt Gödel. Gödel simplified Bernays&#x27; theory by making every set a class, which allowed him to use just one sort and one membership primitive. He also weakened some of Bernays&#x27; axioms and replaced von Neumann&#x27;s choice axiom with the equivalent axiom of global choice. Gödel used his axioms in his 1940 monograph on the relative consistency of global choice and the generalized continuum hypothesis.

Several reasons have been given for Gödel choosing NBG for his monograph:
* Gödel gave a mathematical reason—NBG&#x27;s global choice produces a stronger consistency theorem: &quot;This stronger form of the axiom [of choice], if consistent with the other axioms, implies, of course, that a weaker form is also consistent.&quot;
* Robert Solovay conjectured: &quot;My guess is that he [Gödel] wished to avoid a discussion of the technicalities involved in developing the rudiments of model theory within axiomatic set theory.&quot;
* Kenneth Kunen gave a reason for Gödel avoiding this discussion: &quot;There is also a much more combinatorial approach to L [the constructible universe], developed by ... [Gödel in his 1940 monograph] in an attempt to explain his work to non-logicians. ... This approach has the merit of removing all vestiges of logic from the treatment of L.&quot;
* Charles Parsons provided a philosophical reason for Gödel&#x27;s choice: &quot;This view [that &#x27;property of set&#x27; is a primitive of set theory] may be reflected in Gödel&#x27;s choice of a theory with class variables as the framework for ... [his monograph].&quot;

Gödel&#x27;s achievement together with the details of his presentation led to the prominence that NBG would enjoy for the next two decades. In 1963, Paul Cohen proved his independence proofs for ZF with the help of some tools that Gödel had developed for his relative consistency proofs for NBG. Later, ZFC became more popular than NBG. This was caused by several factors, including the extra work required to handle forcing in NBG, Cohen&#x27;s 1966 presentation of forcing, which used ZF, and the proof that NBG is a conservative extension of ZFC.

==NBG, ZFC, and MK==
NBG is not logically equivalent to ZFC because its language is more expressive: it can make statements about classes, which cannot be made in ZFC. However, NBG and ZFC imply the same statements about sets. Therefore, NBG is a conservative extension of ZFC. NBG implies theorems that ZFC does not imply, but since NBG is a conservative extension, these theorems must involve proper classes. For example, it is a theorem of NBG that the global axiom of choice implies that the proper class &quot;V&quot; can be well-ordered and that every proper class can be put into one-to-one correspondence with &quot;V&quot;.

One consequence of conservative extension is that ZFC and NBG are equiconsistent. Proving this uses the principle of explosion: from a contradiction, everything is provable. Assume that either ZFC or NBG is inconsistent. Then the inconsistent theory implies the contradictory statements ∅ = ∅ and ∅ ≠ ∅, which are statements about sets. By the conservative extension property, the other theory also implies these statements. Therefore, it is also inconsistent. So although NBG is more expressive, it is equiconsistent with ZFC. This result together with von Neumann&#x27;s 1929 relative consistency proof implies that his 1925 axiom system with the axiom of limitation of size is equiconsistent with ZFC. This completely resolves von Neumann&#x27;s concern about the relative consistency of this powerful axiom since ZFC is within the Cantorian framework.

Even though NBG is a conservative extension of ZFC, a theorem may have a shorter and more elegant proof in NBG than in ZFC (or vice versa). For a survey of known results of this nature, see .

Morse–Kelley set theory has an axiom schema of class comprehension that includes formulas whose quantifiers range over classes. MK is a stronger theory than NBG because MK proves the consistency of NBG, while Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem implies that NBG cannot prove the consistency of NBG.

For a discussion of some ontological and other philosophical issues posed by NBG, especially when contrasted with ZFC and MK, see Appendix C of .

===Models===
ZFC, NBG, and MK have models describable in terms of the cumulative hierarchy &quot;Vα&quot; and the constructible hierarchy &quot;Lα&quot;. Let &quot;V&quot; include an inaccessible cardinal κ, let &quot;X&quot; ⊆ &quot;Vκ&quot;, and let Def(&quot;X&quot;) denote the class of first-order definable subsets of &quot;X&quot; with parameters. In symbols where &quot;formula_251&quot; denotes the model with domain formula_252 and relation formula_11, and &quot;formula_254&quot; denotes the satisfaction relation:
formula_255

Then:
* formula_256 and formula_257 are models of ZFC.
* (&quot;V&quot;κ, &quot;V&quot;κ+1, ∈) is a model of MK where &quot;V&quot;κ consists of the sets of the model and &quot;V&quot;κ+1 consists of the classes of the model. Since a model of MK is a model of NBG, this model is also a model of NBG. 
* (&quot;V&quot;κ, Def(&quot;V&quot;κ), ∈) is a model of Mendelson&#x27;s version of NBG, which replaces NBG&#x27;s axiom of global choice with ZFC&#x27;s axiom of choice. The axioms of ZFC are true in this model because (&quot;V&quot;κ, ∈) is a model of ZFC. In particular, ZFC&#x27;s axiom of choice holds, but NBG&#x27;s global choice may fail. NBG&#x27;s class existence axioms are true in this model because the classes whose existence they assert can be defined by first-order definitions. For example, the membership axiom holds since the class formula_61 is defined by: formula_259
* (&quot;L&quot;κ, &quot;L&quot;κ+, ∈), where κ+ is the successor cardinal of κ, is a model of NBG. NBG&#x27;s class existence axioms are true in (&quot;L&quot;κ, &quot;L&quot;κ+, ∈). For example, the membership axiom holds since the class formula_61 is defined by: formula_261 So &quot;E&quot; ∈ 𝒫(&quot;L&quot;κ). In his proof that GCH is true in &quot;L&quot;, Gödel proved that 𝒫(&quot;L&quot;κ) ⊆ &quot;L&quot;κ+. Therefore, &quot;E&quot; ∈ &quot;L&quot;κ+, so the membership axiom is true in (&quot;L&quot;κ, &quot;L&quot;κ+, ∈). Likewise, the other class existence axioms are true. The axiom of global choice is true because &quot;L&quot;κ is well-ordered by the restriction of Gödel&#x27;s function (which maps the class of ordinals to the constructible sets) to the ordinals less than κ. Therefore, (&quot;L&quot;κ, &quot;L&quot;κ+, ∈) is a model of NBG.
* If formula_262 is a nonstandard model of formula_263, then formula_264 is equivalent to &quot;there exists an formula_252 such that formula_266&quot;, where formula_267 is the set of subsets of formula_262 that are definable over formula_262. This provides a second-order part for extending a given first-order nonstandard model of formula_263 to a nonstandard model of formula_271, if there is such an extension at all.

==Category theory==
The ontology of NBG provides scaffolding for speaking about &quot;large objects&quot; without risking paradox. For instance, in some developments of category theory, a &quot;large category&quot; is defined as one whose objects and morphisms make up a proper class. On the other hand, a &quot;small category&quot; is one whose objects and morphisms are members of a set. Thus, we can speak of the &quot;category of all sets&quot; or &quot;category of all small categories&quot; without risking paradox since NBG supports large categories.

However, NBG does not support a &quot;category of all categories&quot; since large categories would be members of it and NBG does not allow proper classes to be members of anything. An ontological extension that enables us to talk formally about such a &quot;category&quot; is the conglomerate, which is a collection of classes. Then the &quot;category of all categories&quot; is defined by its objects: the conglomerate of all categories; and its morphisms: the conglomerate of all morphisms from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are objects. On whether an ontology including classes as well as sets is adequate for category theory, see .

<text>The Mandala of the Two Realms (Traditional Chinese: 両界曼荼羅; Pinyin: &quot;Liǎngjiè màntúluó&quot;; Rōmaji: &quot;Ryōkai mandara&quot;), also known as the Mandala of the Two Divisions (Traditional Chinese: 両部曼荼羅; Pinyin: &quot;Liǎngbù màntúluó&quot;; Rōmaji: &quot;Ryōbu mandara&quot;), is a set of two mandalas depicting both the Five Wisdom Buddhas of the Diamond Realm as well as the Five Wisdom Kings of the Womb Realm. The number of deities arranged around the cores varies, but may range as high as 414.

The Diamond Realm represents the unchanging cosmic principle of the Buddha, while the Womb Realm depicts the active, physical manifestation of Buddha in the natural world. The mandalas are thus considered a compact expression of the entirety of the Dharma in Mahayana Buddhism, and form the root of the Vajrayana teachings. Chinese Tangmi and Japanese Shingon and Tendai temples, in particular, often prominently display the Mandalas of the Two Realms mounted at right angles to the image platform on the central altar.

The two mandalas are believed to have evolved separately in India, and were joined for the first time in China, perhaps by Kūkai&#x27;s teacher Hui-kuo.

<text>François-Auguste Gevaert (31 July 1828 – 24 December 1908) was a Belgian musicologist and composer.

==Life==

Gevaert was born in Huise, near Oudenaarde. His father was a baker, and he was intended for the same profession, but better counsels prevailed and he was permitted to study music. He was sent in 1841 to the Ghent Conservatory, where he studied under Édouard de Sommere and Martin-Joseph Mengal. Then he was appointed organist of the Jesuit church in that city.

Soon Gevaert&#x27;s compositions attracted attention, and he won the Belgian Prix de Rome which entitled him to two years&#x27; travel. The journey was postponed during the production of his first opera and other works. He finally embarked on it in 1849. After a short stay in Paris he went to Spain, and subsequently to Italy.

In 1867 Gevaert, having returned to Paris, became at the Academie de Musique there, in succession to the popular operatic composer Fromental Halévy. Four years later, he was appointed head of the Brussels Conservatoire. In that role, he &quot;exerted a far-reaching influence through his historical concerts, producing works of all nations and periods.&quot; Gevaert died in Brussels.

Though during his lifetime Gevaert&#x27;s own music enjoyed considerable success in Belgium (it included no fewer than a dozen operas, including &quot;Quentin Durward&quot; and &quot;Le Capitaine Henriot&quot;), it is now forgotten, save for some of his choral pieces, which have recently been issued on CD by the Fuga Libera label. Nowadays he is mostly remembered, even in his native land, less as a composer than as a teacher, historian, and lecturer. His many prose writings include a &quot;Treatise on Instrumentation&quot; (still sometimes used today), a book on harmony, and a &quot;Vade Mecum&quot; for organists. Notable students of Gevaert included Alfred Wotquenne, who is best known for having provided the first thorough listing of C. P. E. Bach&#x27;s compositions, whilst Gevaert&#x27;s daughter Jacqueline Marthe married the singer and art historian Hippolyte Fierens-Gevaert.

<doc id="528520" wikidata="Q189072" url="?curid=528520" title="Theatre of ancient Greece">
<text>A theatrical culture flourished in ancient Greece from 700 BC. At its centre was the city-state of Athens, which became a significant cultural, political, and religious place during this period, and the theatre was institutionalised there as part of a festival called the Dionysia, which honoured the god Dionysus. Tragedy (late 500 BC), comedy (490 BC), and the satyr play were the three dramatic genres emerged there. Athens exported the festival to its numerous colonies. Modern Western theatre comes, in large measure, from the theatre of ancient Greece, from which it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres, and many of its themes, stock characters, and plot elements.

==Etymology==
The word , from which the word &quot;tragedy&quot; is derived, is a compound of two Greek words: or &quot;goat&quot; and meaning &quot;song&quot;, from .

This etymology indicates a link with the practices of the ancient Dionysian cults. It is impossible, however, to know with certainty how these fertility rituals became the basis for tragedy and comedy.

==Origins==

The Ancient Greeks valued the power of the spoken word, and it was their main method of communication and storytelling. Bahn and Bahn write, &quot;To Greeks, the spoken word was a living thing and infinitely preferable to the dead symbols of a written language.&quot; Socrates himself believed that once something has been written down, it lost its ability for change and growth. For these reasons, among many others, oral storytelling flourished in Greece.

Greek tragedy, as it is presently known, was created in Athens around 532 BC, when Thespis was the earliest recorded actor. Being a winner of the first theatrical contest held in Athens, he was the , or leader, of the dithyrambs performed in and around Attica, especially at the Rural Dionysia. By Thespis&#x27; time, the dithyramb had evolved far away from its cult roots. Under the influence of heroic epic, Doric choral lyric and the innovations of the poet Arion, it had become a narrative, ballad-like genre. Because of these, Thespis is often called the &quot;Inventor of Tragedy&quot;; however, his importance is disputed, and Thespis is sometimes listed as late as 16th in the chronological order of Greek tragedians; the statesman Solon, for example, is credited with creating poems in which characters speak with their own voice, and spoken performances of Homer&#x27;s epics by rhapsodes were popular in festivals prior to 534 BC. Thus, Thespis&#x27;s true contribution to drama is unclear at best, but his name has been given a longer life in English as a common term for performer—i.e., a &quot;thespian.&quot;

The dramatic performances were important to the Athenians – this is made clear by the creation of a tragedy competition and festival in the City Dionysia (or Great Dionysia). This was organized possibly to foster loyalty among the tribes of Attica (recently created by Cleisthenes). The festival was created roughly around 508 BC. While no drama texts exist from the sixth century BC, the names of three competitors besides Thespis are known: Choerilus, Pratinas, and Phrynichus. Each is credited with different innovations in the field.

Some information is known about Phrynichus. He won his first competition between 511 BC and 508 BC. He produced tragedies on themes and subjects later exploited in the Golden Age such as the &quot;Danaids&quot;, &quot;Phoenician Women&quot; and &quot;Alcestis&quot;. He was the first poet we know of to use a historical subject – his &quot;Fall of Miletus&quot;, produced in 493–2, chronicled the fate of the town of Miletus after it was conquered by the Persians. Herodotus reports that &quot;the Athenians made clear their deep grief for the taking of Miletus in many ways, but especially in this: when Phrynichus wrote a play entitled &quot;The Fall of Miletus&quot; and produced it, the whole theatre fell to weeping; they fined Phrynichus a thousand drachmas for bringing to mind a calamity that affected them so personally and forbade the performance of that play forever.&quot; He is also thought to be the first to use female characters (though not female performers).

Until the Hellenistic period, all tragedies were unique pieces written in honour of Dionysus and played only once; what is primarily extant today are the pieces that were still remembered well enough to have been repeated when the repetition of old tragedies became fashionable (the accidents of survival, as well as the subjective tastes of the Hellenistic librarians later in Greek history, also played a role in what survived from this period).

==New inventions during the classical period==

After the Achaemenid destruction of Athens in 480 BC, the town and acropolis were rebuilt, and theatre became formalized and an even greater part of Athenian culture and civic pride. This century is normally regarded as the Golden Age of Greek drama. The center-piece of the annual Dionysia, which took place once in winter and once in spring, was a competition between three tragic playwrights at the Theatre of Dionysus. Each submitted three tragedies, plus a satyr play (a comic, burlesque version of a mythological subject). Beginning in a first competition in 486 BC each playwright submitted a comedy. Aristotle claimed that Aeschylus added the second actor (deuteragonist), and that Sophocles introduced the third (tritagonist). Apparently, the Greek playwrights never used more than three actors based on what is known about Greek theatre.

Tragedy and comedy were viewed as completely separate genres, and no plays ever merged aspects of the two. Satyr plays dealt with the mythological subject matter of the tragedies, but in a purely comedic manner.

==Hellenistic period==
The power of Athens declined following its defeat in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta. From that time on, the theatre started performing old tragedies again. Although its theatrical traditions seem to have lost their vitality, Greek theatre continued into the Hellenistic period (the period following Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquests in the fourth century BC).

The primary Hellenistic theatrical form was not tragedy but New Comedy, comic episodes about the lives of ordinary citizens. The only extant playwright from the period is Menander. One of New Comedy&#x27;s most important contributions was its influence on Roman comedy, an influence that can be seen in the surviving works of Plautus and Terence.

==Architecture==

Most ancient Greek cities lay on or near hills, so seating was generally built into the slope of a hill, producing a natural viewing area known as the (literally &quot;seeing place&quot;). In cities without suitable hills, banks of earth were piled up. At the foot of the hill was a flattened, generally circular performance space with an average diameter of , known as the (literally &quot;dancing place&quot;), where a chorus of typically 12 to 15 people performed plays in verse accompanied by music. There were often tall, arched entrances called or , through which actors and chorus members entered and exited the orchestra. In some theatres, behind the orchestra, was a backdrop or scenic wall known as the .

The term eventually came to mean the whole area of , , and .

===&quot;Theatron&quot;===

The was the seating area, built into a hill to create a natural viewing space. The first seats in Greek theatres (other than just sitting on the ground) were wooden, but around 499 BC, the practice of inlaying stone blocks into the side of the hill to create permanent, stable seating became more common. They were called the and reserved for priests and a few of the most respected citizens. The separated the upper and lower seating areas.
After 465 BC, playwrights began using a backdrop or scenic wall, called the (from which the word &quot;scene&quot; derives), that hung or stood behind the orchestra and also served as an area where actors could change their costumes. After 425 BC a stone scene wall, called a , became a common supplement to . The was a long wall with projecting sides, which may have had doorways for entrances and exits. Just behind the was the (&quot;in front of the scene&quot;), which is similar to the modern day proscenium. The upper story was called the . Some theatres also had a raised speaking place on the orchestra called the . By the end of the 5th century BC, around the time of the Peloponnesian War, the was two stories high.

The death of a character was always heard behind the , for it was considered inappropriate to show a killing in view of the audience. Conversely, there are scholarly arguments that death in Greek tragedy was portrayed off stage primarily because of dramatic considerations, and not prudishness or sensitivity of the audience.

A temple nearby, especially on the right side of the scene, is almost always part of the Greek theatre complex. This could justify, as a transposition, the recurrence of the pediment with the later solidified stone scene.

===Orchestra===

The orchestra was a circular piece of ground at the bottom of the theatron where the chorus and actors performed; the word means &quot;dancing space&quot;, as the chorus also danced in early periods. Originally unraised, Greek theatre would later incorporate a raised stage for easier viewing. This practice would become common after the advent of &quot;New Comedy,&quot; which incorporated dramatic portrayal of individual characters. The &quot;coryphaeus&quot; was the head chorus member, who could enter the story as a character able to interact with the characters of a play. Plays often began in the morning and lasted into the evening.

===Acoustics===
The theatres were built on a large scale to accommodate a large number of performers on stage and in the audience—up to fourteen thousand. Physics and mathematics played a significant role in the construction of these theatres, as their designers had to be able to create acoustics in them such that the actors&#x27; voices could be heard throughout the theatre, including the very top row of seats. The Greek&#x27;s understanding of acoustics compares very favorably with the current state of the art.

===Scenic elements===
There were several scenic elements commonly used in Greek theatre:

* &quot;mechane&quot;, a crane for lifting an actor to represent flying (thus, &quot;deus ex machina&quot;)
* &quot;ekkyklêma&quot;, a wheeled platform often used to bring dead characters into view for the audience
* &quot;pinakes&quot;, pictures hung to create scenery
* &quot;thyromata&quot;, more complex pictures built into the second-level scene (3rd level from the ground)

==Masks==

===Masks===
The Ancient Greek term for a mask is &quot;prosopon&quot; (lit., &quot;face&quot;), and was a significant element in the worship of Dionysus at Athens likely used in ceremonial rites and celebrations. Many masks worshipped the higher power, the gods, making masks also very important for religion. Most of the evidence comes from only a few vase paintings of the 5th century BC, such as one showing a mask of the god suspended from a tree with decorated robe hanging below it and dancing and the &quot;Pronomos&quot; vase, which depicts actors preparing for a satyr play. No physical evidence remains available to us, as the masks were made of organic materials and not considered permanent objects, ultimately being dedicated at the altar of Dionysus after performances. Nevertheless, the mask is known to have been used since the time of Aeschylus and considered to be one of the iconic conventions of classical Greek theatre.

Masks were also made for members of the chorus, who play some part in the action and provide a commentary on the events in which they are caught up. Although there are twelve or fifteen members of the tragic chorus, they all wear the same mask because they are considered to be representing one character.

Stylized comedy and tragedy masks said to originate in ancient Greek theatre have come to widely symbolize the performing arts generally.

===Mask details ===
Illustrations of theatrical masks from 5th century display helmet-like masks, covering the entire face and head, with holes for the eyes and a small aperture for the mouth and an integrated wig. These paintings never show actual masks on the actors in performance. They are most often shown being handled by the actors before or after a performance. This demonstrates the way in which the mask was to &#x27;melt&#x27; into the face and allow the actor to vanish into the role. Effectively, the mask transformed the actor as much as memorization of the text. Therefore, performance in ancient Greece did not distinguish the masked actor from the theatrical character.

The mask-makers were called &quot;skeuopoios&quot; or &quot;maker of the props&quot;, thus suggesting that their role encompassed multiple duties and tasks. The masks were most likely made out of light weight, organic materials like stiffened linen, leather, wood, or cork, with the wig consisting of human or animal hair. Due to the visual restrictions imposed by these masks, it was imperative that the actors hear in order to orient and balance themselves. Thus, it is believed that the ears were covered by substantial amounts of hair and not the helmet-mask itself. The mouth opening was relatively small, preventing the mouth being seen during performances. Vervain and Wiles posit that this small size discourages the idea that the mask functioned as a megaphone, as originally presented in the 1960s. Greek mask-maker Thanos Vovolis suggests that the mask serves as a resonator for the head, thus enhancing vocal acoustics and altering its quality. This leads to increased energy and presence, allowing for the more complete metamorphosis of the actor into his character.

===Mask functions===
In a large open-air theatre, like the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens, the classical masks were able to create a sense of dread in the audience creating large scale panic, especially since they had intensely exaggerated facial features and expressions. They enabled an actor to appear and reappear in several different roles, thus preventing the audience from identifying the actor to one specific character. Their variations help the audience to distinguish sex, age, and social status, in addition to revealing a change in a particular character&#x27;s appearance, e.g., Oedipus, after blinding himself. Unique masks were also created for specific characters and events in a play, such as the Furies in Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Eumenides&quot; and Pentheus and Cadmus in Euripides&#x27; &quot;The Bacchae&quot;. Worn by the chorus, the masks created a sense of unity and uniformity, while representing a multi-voiced persona or single organism and simultaneously encouraged interdependency and a heightened sensitivity between each individual of the group. Only 2 to 3 actors were allowed on the stage at one time, and masks permitted quick transitions from one character to another. There were only male actors, but masks allowed them to play female characters.

The modern method to interpret a role by switching between a few simple characters goes back to changing masks in the theatre of ancient Greece.

===Other costume details===

The actors in these plays that had tragic roles wore boots called &quot;cothurnus&quot; (buskin), that elevated them above the other actors. The actors with comedic roles only wore a thin-soled shoe called a &quot;soccus&quot; or sock. For this reason, dramatic art is sometimes called &quot;sock and buskin.&quot;

Male actors playing female roles would wear a wooden structure on their chests (&quot;posterneda&quot;) to imitate the look of breasts and another structure on their stomachs (&quot;progastreda&quot;) to make them appear softer and more lady like. They would also wear white body stockings under their costumes to make their skin appear fairer.

Most costuming detail comes from pottery paintings from that time as costumes and masks were fabricated out of disposable material, so there are little to no remains of any costume from that time. The biggest source of information is the Pronomos Vase where actors are painted at a show&#x27;s after party.

Costuming would give off a sense of character, as in gender, age, social status, and class. For example, characters of higher class would be dressed in nicer clothing, although everyone was dressed fairly nicely. Contrary to popular belief, they did not dress in only rags and sandals, as they wanted to impress. Some examples of Greek theatre costuming include long robes called chiton that reached the floor for actors playing gods, heroes, and old men. Actors playing goddesses and women characters that held a lot of power wore purple and gold. Actors playing queens and princesses wore long cloaks that dragged on the ground and were decorated with gold stars and other jewels, and warriors were dressed in a variety of armor and wore helmets adorned with plumes. Costumes were supposed to be colourful and obvious to be easily seen by every seat in the audience.

<text>Ballymahon () on the River Inny is a town in the southern part of County Longford, Ireland. It is 19 km north-east of Athlone, at the junction of the N55 and R392 roads.

==History==
Ballymahon derives its name from the Irish language term &quot;Baile Uí Mhatháin &quot; or &quot;Baile Mathuna&quot;, meaning &quot;Town of Mahon&quot;. This may refer to Mahon (Mathgamain mac Cennétig), a southern chieftain and the elder brother of Brian Boru, who is believed by some to have fought a battle in 960 in the vicinity of Ballymahon at Shrule (in Irish &quot;Sruaith Fhuil&quot;, River of Blood) where he defeated O&#x27;Rourke of Cavan and laid claim to lands in the area. This is disputed by others who claim Mahon may relate to a sub chieftain of the O&#x27;Farrells who ruled over this part of County Longford in the 14th century.

The earliest documentary evidence of Ballymahon is from the year 1578, when lands in the area were granted to the Dillon family, later Earls of Roscommon. By 1654, the maps of William Petty&#x27;s Down Survey shows Ballymahon as a group of houses situated at the southern end of the present town, on the right bank of the River Inny.

Two main families, the Shuldham family of Moigh House and the King-Harman family of Newcastle House, developed the town in the mid-nineteenth century. The buildings in the town are of late Georgian architecture, with two and three-storey gabled houses, colour-washed and in rows of three and four. From 1788 to 1853, the Roman Catholic bishops of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise resided in the town, and the parish church served as a Pro-Cathedral until St Mel&#x27;s Cathedral was built in Longford.

==Geography==
The River Inny, a tributary of the River Shannon, flows westwards through Ballymahon in the direction of Lough Ree three miles from the town. A stretch of the Inny from Newcastle Bridge to Ballymahon town is used for beginner to intermediate kayaking, canoeing and time trials.

The Royal Canal also passes westwards through Ballymahon from Dublin to Clondra, County Longford. Following extensive works the canal has been restored and is now fully navigable. Brannigan Harbour, c.1 km from Ballymahon town, is on the Royal Canal and is a common point for boats and barges to stop and pass.

==Built heritage==
Churches in the town include St Matthew&#x27;s Roman Catholic church (built 1906) which is constructed in a Gothic-style and located on the northwest side of Ballymahon. St Catherine&#x27;s Church of Ireland church (built 1800, rebuilt 1824) has a narrow spire which is a prominent feature in the town.

Ballymahon Courthouse and Market House, originally built in the early 19th century, is a community library. It is situated in the centre of the town (built 1819).

Opposite St Catherine&#x27;s Church is the old RIC police barracks built on the northern edge of what local tradition holds was a castle or fortress of the O&#x27;Farrell Clan, earthworks of which can still be seen off the Fairgreen/Thomand Lodge Road. It became a Garda station after the establishment of the Irish Free State and remained in service until 1996 when a new, smaller, station was built on the southern bank of the river opposite the old mill. The barracks was attacked during the War of Independence in August 1920. The attack was led by General Seán MacEoin, Seán Connolly (who fired the first shot in the Easter Rising and was later killed himself in the Selton Hill ambush) and Frank Davis. A small party of local volunteers also took part in the raid which mainly aimed to seize firearms. MacEoin later visited the barracks to campaign during an election campaign in the 1950s. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh was held here in the 1950s during the IRA Border War which ended in 1962.

==Transport and communications==
Ballymahon is on the N55 road, a National Secondary route leading from Athlone, 22 kilometres by road to the south, towards Belfast and Northern Ireland. The county town of Longford lies 22 kilometres by road to the north.

The R392 road links Ballymahon to Mullingar in the east and to Roscommon in the west, via Lanesborough–Ballyleague. This route was a portion of an ancient ceremonial way from Rathcroghan to the Hill of Tara. Intact portions of the ancient roadway can be seen at the nearby Corlea Trackway and the ceremonial route attests to the straightness of the R392.

The Royal Canal links Ballymahon to Dublin, via several towns such as Mullingar and Maynooth, and to the River Shannon at Clondra.

Bus services include Bus Éireann route 466 which links Ballymahon with Athlone railway station in County Westmeath, and Local Link route 24 to Longford town and Longford railway station.

==Education==
Ballymahon has a primary school, St. Matthew&#x27;s National School, which had an enrollment of over 360 pupils as of 2019. There are also two secondary schools in the area: Mercy Secondary School and Ballymahon Vocational School. The nearest third-level college is Athlone Institute of Technology in Athlone, approximately 22 km away.

==Culture and sport==
Ballymahon is home to the Bog Lane Theatre. It also hosts the Oliver Goldsmith Summer School, a festival of literature which is held on the June Bank Holiday Weekend, with poetry readings held at Goldsmith&#x27;s birthplace in Pallas. Ballymahon also plays host to the annual Still Voices International Film Festival.

The town&#x27;s Gaelic football (GAA) club is Ballymahon GAA, and its association football (soccer) club is Ballymahon AFC.

==Twin towns==
Ballymahon is twinned with the two adjacent towns of Landévant and Landaul in the Morbihan region of Brittany in north-west France. Twinning events and cross-cultural tours are held annually.

==People==

* Sir Thomas Molyneux (1661–1733) and William Molyneux (1656–1698), natural philosopher and writer, were descendants of the Dowdall-Molyneux family who had large estates in Ballymulvey, near Ballymahon.
* Thomas Marlay (c.1680–1756), Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, was born at Creevagh Beg, Ballymahon.
* Oliver Goldsmith (1728–1774), author, was born in the nearby townland of Pallas and raised in nearby Lissoy (The Pigeons). His mother was resident in the town in her latter years in a building later demolished during the widening of the N55 junction in the 1990s. Ballymahon has a monument on the main street commemorating the poet as well as a commemorative monument and park at his birthplace in Pallas.
* John Keegan Casey (1846–1870), known as &quot;the poet of the Fenians&quot; was born in 1846 in County Westmeath before his family moved to Gurteen outside Ballymahon where his father was schoolmaster. Casey later taught in the area and became involved in the Fenian movement locally.
* John Henry Patterson (1867–1947), soldier and author, was born in Forgney near Ballymahon. His book &quot;The Man-Eaters of Tsavo&quot; (1907) details his experiences while building a railway bridge in Kenya in the late 1890s.
* Dr Kathleen Lynn, political and women&#x27;s rights activist and medical doctor, lived in Ballymahon for four years in her youth from 1882 to 1886, while her father served as a Church of Ireland clergyman to the Ballymahon Parish.
* James Dooley (1877-1950), Australian politician and Premier of New South Wales, was born at Currycreaghan near Ballymahon.
* Maura Higgins (b.1990), reality television personality and contestant on the fifth series of Love Island.

<doc id="528543" wikidata="Q1971438" url="?curid=528543" title="Therapeutic touch">
<text>Therapeutic touch (TT), or non-contact therapeutic touch (NCTT), is a pseudoscientific energy therapy which practitioners claim promotes healing and reduces pain and anxiety. &quot;Therapeutic Touch&quot; is a registered trademark in Canada for the and standardized healing practice performed by practitioners trained to be sensitive to the receiver&#x27;s energy field that surrounds the body;...no touching is required.&quot;

Practitioners of therapeutic touch state that by placing their hands on, or near, a patient, they are able to detect and manipulate what they say is the patient&#x27;s energy field. One highly cited study, designed by the then-nine-year-old Emily Rosa and published in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; in 1998, found that practitioners of therapeutic touch could not detect the presence or absence of a hand placed a few inches above theirs when their vision was obstructed. Simon Singh and Edzard Ernst concluded in their 2008 book &quot;Trick or Treatment&quot; that &quot;the energy field was probably nothing more than a figment in the imaginations of the healers&quot;. The American Cancer Society noted, &quot;Available scientific evidence does not support any claims that TT can cure cancer or other diseases.&quot; A 2004 Cochrane review found no good evidence that it helped with wound healing, but the authors withdrew it in 2016 &quot;due to serious concerns over the validity of included studies&quot;.

== Origin and foundations ==
Dora Kunz, a theosophy promoter and one-time president (1975–1987) of the Theosophical Society in America, and Dolores Krieger, now Professor Emerita of Nursing Science, New York University, developed therapeutic touch in the 1970s. According to Krieger, therapeutic touch has roots in ancient healing practices, such as the laying on of hands, although it has no connection with religion or with faith healing. Krieger states that, &quot;in the final analysis, it is the healee (client) who heals himself. The healer or therapist, in this view, acts as a human energy support system until the healee&#x27;s own immunological system is robust enough to take over&quot;.

Justification for TT has been sought in two fields: Martha E. Rogers&#x27; contemporal &quot;Science of Unitary Human Beings&quot;, and quantum mechanics, in particular Fritjof Capra&#x27;s mystical interpretation of the latter. A 2002 review found that neither justification was tenable: Rogers&#x27; theories were found to be inconsistent with the tenets of TT, while the overlap in terminology between the two could be ascribed to a lack of precision in Rogers&#x27; works, making them multi-interpretable. The quantum physics justification holds that the possibility to heal at a distance is possible due to a &quot;global interconnectivity&quot; of the universe, which is connected by TT adherents to an interpretation of Bell&#x27;s theorem and the possibility of quantum nonlocality; this interpretation is not supported by experimental evidence. The 2002 study concluded that &quot;the theory TT possesses is deprived of explanatory power&quot; and &quot;evidence that supports the current picture of physical energy should be regarded as evidence against the theory of TT&quot;.

The supposed healing in TT takes place via a discredited physical process called &quot;electron transfer resonance&quot;, which physicist Alan Sokal describes as &quot;nonsense&quot;.

==Scientific investigations==
Over the decades, many clinical studies have been performed to investigate TT&#x27;s efficacy, as well as various meta-analyses and at least one systematic review, yielding varying results and conclusions. O&#x27;Mathúna &quot;et al.&quot;, in discussing these studies, note several problems, such as failure to exclude methodologically flawed studies and a susceptibility to the publication bias of complementary medicine journals, which carry a &quot;preponderance of studies with positive results&quot;; they argue that

Emily Rosa, at nine years of age, conceived and executed a study on therapeutic touch. With the help of Stephen Barrett from Quackwatch and the assistance of her mother, Linda Rosa and her step-father Larry Sarner, Emily became the youngest researcher to have a paper accepted by the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; (&quot;JAMA&quot;), which debunked the claim of therapeutic touch practitioners can reliably sense a &quot;Human Energy Field.&quot; Twenty-one practitioners of therapeutic touch participated in her study. The practitioners sat on one side of a cardboard screen, while Emily sat on the other. The practitioners then placed their hands through holes in the screen. Emily flipped a coin to determine which of the practitioner&#x27;s hands she would place hers over (approximately 4-5 inches above the subject&#x27;s hand). The practitioners then were to say where her hand was by sensing her biofield. Although all of the participants had asserted that they would be able to do this, the actual results did not support therapeutic touch&#x27;s fundamental claim. The practitioners had succeeded in locating Emily&#x27;s hand 44% of the time, a rate within the range of chance. &quot;JAMA&quot; editor George D. Lundberg, M.D, recommended that third-party payers and the public should question paying for this procedure &quot;until or unless additional honest experimentation demonstrates an actual effect.&quot;

There is no good medical evidence for the effectiveness of therapeutic touch. A Cochrane systematic review, first published in 2004, found &quot;[t]here is no robust evidence that TT promotes healing of acute wounds&quot;, but in 2016 the authors retracted it after the validity of the reviewed studies were questioned. The American Cancer Society noted, &quot;Available scientific evidence does not support any claims that TT can cure cancer or other diseases.&quot;

== Skeptical view of therapeutic touch ==
When examining the existing literature on therapeutic touch, it has been observed that these studies tend to only cite research that favours the desired findings. There have been studies focused on therapeutic touch that have failed to include any research that has contradictory findings. However, it is very important for studies such as these to report all results found from other studies even if they may contradict the present study&#x27;s hypothesis.

It is also important to use the appropriate controls in such studies. There have been studies such as that by Grad, Cadoret, and Paul that have appeared at first glance to show the effectiveness of therapeutic touch, yet once replicated using the appropriate controls, they were shown to have nonsignificant results, therefore rendering the original results inconclusive.

Researcher bias has been noted in studies examining therapeutic touch, such as that by Turner, in which he included such statements as, &quot;If we can successfully complete this study, this will be the first real scientific evidence there is for therapeutic touch&quot;. It is important for researchers not to bias the results in order to achieve their desired outcome, as bias can lead to a misrepresentation of the true effectiveness of therapy such as that of therapeutic touch.

Replication is another important factor. A study on therapeutic touch by Wirth appeared to have successful results in which more than half of the subjects being treated by this therapy had healed by day 16, with no healing shown in the control group. However, closer examination of this study reveals that there were several trials to test therapy, that only two of the five trials were successful, and that the control group actually healed as well or better than the treatment group in the other three trials. This makes the results of such a study inconclusive in showing any effectiveness of therapeutic touch.

== Therapeutic touch and nursing education ==
Sokal, in 2006, reported generally accepted estimates of over 80 colleges and universities spread over 70 countries where therapeutic touch is taught as well as some 80 hospitals in North America where it is practiced. He added that &quot;these figures should be taken with a grain of salt, inasmuch as both advocates and detractors [...] have an interest in exaggerating its incidence&quot;.

Owen Hammer and James Underdown from the Independent Investigations Group examined nursing standards in California, where the California Board of Registered Nursing (CBRN) can award registered nurses taking classes in therapeutic touch with continuing education units (CEUs) required for licensure renewal. In 2006, Hammer and Underdown presented the board with the scientific evidence refuting the validity of therapeutic touch as a legitimate treatment, but the board did not change its policy.

<text>Christof Prick (born 1946) is a German orchestra conductor. He uses the name Christof Perick in English-speaking countries. His father was the concertmaster of the Hamburg Philharmonic.

==Biography==
Born in Hamburg, Prick studied at the University of Music and Theater in his hometown Hamburg. He was appointed to the Theater Saarbrücken as Germany&#x27;s youngest general music director in 1974. From 1977 to 1986, he was responsible for the Staatstheater Karlsruhe and the Badische Staatskapelle in the same position. He was &quot;Generalmusikdirektor&quot; of the Niedersächsisches Staatsorchester and of the Staatsoper Hannover from 1993 to 1996.

His work in contemporary music has included conducting the premiere of Wolfgang Rihm&#x27;s opera &quot;Oedipus&quot; in October 1987.

Perick became Music Director of the Charlotte Symphony Orchestra in 2001. He stepped down from this post in 2010 and served as the orchestra&#x27;s conductor laureate for the 2010–2011 season.

From 2006 to 2011, Perick was Music Director of the Staatstheater Nürnberg, including the post of principal conductor of the Staatsphilharmonie Nürnberg. In addition to his conducting posts, since 1999, he has been a professor of conducting at the Staatliche Hochschule für Musik in Hamburg. In July 2015, the Beethoven Orchester Bonn announced the appointment of Perick as its interim &quot;Generalmusikdirektor&quot; for the 2016–2017 season.

==Recordings==
Perick&#x27;s recordings include a 1988 recording of Franz Schmidt&#x27;s rarely heard opera &quot;Notre Dame&quot;.

==Personal life==
Perick and his wife Ulrike, an actress, make their home in Germany.

<text>Zmacs is one of the many variants of the Emacs text editor. Zmacs was written for the MIT Lisp machine and runs on its descendants (Symbolics Genera, LMI Lambda, TI Explorer). Zmacs is written in Lisp Machine Lisp (called ZetaLisp on Symbolics Lisp Machines). It is based on the ZWEI programming substrate, which stands for &quot;Zwei Was EINE Initially&quot;; Zwei was a collection of routines which could be used to easily implement other programs, like the Symbolics mail program, &quot;Zmail&quot;.

A distinctive feature of Zmacs, which can also be found in Hemlock and LispWorks, is that commands look like instead of as modern Emacsen, like GNU Emacs, generally format commands.

Zmacs also supports buffers and modes. Zmacs also uses the window system of the Lisp Machine with support for mouse and windows. Zmacs supports unlimited backup of files, since the file system of the Lisp Machine supports file versions. It is not compatible with GNU Emacs and its Emacs Lisp.

<doc id="528549" wikidata="Q3275223" url="?curid=528549" title="Coenocyte">
<text>A coenocyte () is a multinucleate cell which can result from multiple nuclear divisions without their accompanying cytokinesis, in contrast to a syncytium, which results from cellular aggregation followed by dissolution of the cell membranes inside the mass. The word syncytium in animal embryology is used to refer to the coenocytic blastoderm of invertebrates. A coenocytic colony is referred to as a coenobium (: coenobia), and most coenobia are composed of a distinct number of cells, often as a multiple of two (4, 8, etc.).

Research suggests that coenobium formation may be a defense against grazing in some species.

==Physiological examples==
===Protists===
Diplomonads, like &quot;Giardia&quot;, have two nuclei.

Ciliates have cells that contain two nuclei: a macronucleus and a micronucleus.

The schizont of apicomplexan parasites is a form of a coenocyte (i.e. a plasmodium in the general sense) as well as the plasmodia of microsporidian (Fungi) and myxosporidian (Metazoa) parasites.

The trophont of syndinean (Dinoflagellata) parasites.

Xenophyophorea are giant cells with numerous nuclei, and is common on the abyssal plains.

====Algae====

Coenocytic cells are present in diverse and unrelated groups of algae, including Xanthophyceae (e.g., &quot;Vaucheria&quot;), red algae (e.g., &quot;Griffithsia&quot;) and green algae (e.g., the internodal cells of &quot;Chara&quot;).

In the siphonous green algae Bryopsidales and some Dasycladales, the entire thallus is a single multinucleate cell, which can be many meters across (e.g. &quot;Caulerpa&quot;). However, in some cases, crosswalls may occur during reproduction.

The green algal order Cladophorales is characterized by siphonocladous organization, i.e., the thalli are composed of many coenocytic cells.

In contrast to the Cladophorales where nuclei are organized in regularly spaced cytoplasmic domains, the cytoplasm of Bryopsidales exhibits streaming, enabling transportation of organelles, transcripts and nutrients across the plant.

The Sphaeropleales also contain many common freshwater genera that are coenocytic, such as &quot;Scenedesmus&quot;, &quot;Hydrodictyon&quot;, and &quot;Pediastrum&quot;.

====Myxogastrids (slime molds)====
:&quot;See Plasmodium (life cycle).&quot;

===Plants===
The endosperm in plants begins to grow when one fertilized cell (the primary endosperm cell) becomes a coenocyte. Different species produce coenocytes with different numbers of nuclei before the PEC eventually begins to subdivide, with some growing to contain thousands of nuclei.

===Fungi===
Some filamentous fungi (such as Glomeromycota, Chytridiomycota and Neocalligomastigomycota) may contain multiple nuclei in a coenocytic mycelium. A coenocyte functions as a single coordinated unit composed of multiple cells linked structurally and functionally, i.e. through gap junctions. Fungal mycelia in which hyphae lack septa are known as &quot;aseptate&quot; or &quot;coenocytic&quot;.

===Metazoans: invertebrates===
Many insects, such as the model organism &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, lay eggs that initially develop as &quot;syncytial&quot; blastoderms, i.e. early on the embryos exhibit incomplete cell division. The nuclei undergo S-phase (DNA replication) and sister chromatids get pulled apart and re-assembled into nuclei containing full sets of homologous chromosomes, but cytokinesis does not occur. Thus, the nuclei multiply in a common cytoplasmic space.

The early embryo &quot;syncytium&quot; of invertebrates such as &quot;Drosophila&quot; is important for &quot;syncytial&quot; specification of cell differentiation. The egg cell cytoplasm contains localized mRNA molecules such as those that encode the transcription factors Bicoid and Nanos. Bicoid protein is expressed in a gradient that extends from the anterior end of the early embryo, whereas Nanos protein is concentrated at the posterior end. At first, the nuclei of the early embryo rapidly and synchronously divide in the &quot;syncytial&quot; blastoderm and then migrate through the cytoplasm and position themselves in a monolayer around the periphery, leaving only a small number of nuclei in the center of the egg, which will become yolk nuclei. The position of the nuclei along the embryonic axes determines the relative exposure of different amounts of Bicoid, Nanos, and other morphogens. Those nuclei with more Bicoid will activate genes that promote differentiation of cells into head and thorax structures. Nuclei exposed to more Nanos will activate genes responsible for differentiation of posterior regions, such as the abdomen and germ cells. The same principles hold true for the specification of the dorso-ventral axis – higher concentration of nuclear Dorsal protein on the ventral side of the egg specify the ventral fate, whereas absence thereof allows dorsal fates.
After the nuclei are positioned in a monolayer underneath the egg membrane, the membrane begins to slowly invaginate, thus separating the nuclei into cellular compartments; during this period, the egg is called a cellular blastoderm. The pole cells – the germline anlage – are the first cells to separate fully.

==Pathological examples==
Certain mutations and the activation of certain cell-cycle control genes can lead to bacteria forming &quot;filament-like&quot; cells with multiple chromosomes but without cellular division. These mechanisms or mistakes may lead to a similar structure to a coenocyte, though bacteria do not possess nuclei. 

This fact has been used in certain synthetic biology applications, for example, to create cell-derived fibers for an organically grown concrete. 

==Etymology==
As with much international scientific vocabulary, English got the word &quot;coenocyte&quot; (&quot;cœnocyte&quot;) from Neo-Latin, in which its combining forms, &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, are based on ancient Greek: κοινός (&quot;koinós&quot;) = &quot;common&quot; + κύτος (&quot;kýtos&quot;) = &quot;box, i.e. cell&quot;). The stressed vowel is œ, which in scientific English usually sounds like long e and usually shifts a preceding &quot;c&quot; to be soft; this explains how there is a degree of regularity in &quot;how one gets a &quot;see-no&quot; sound from &quot;coeno-&quot;,&quot; which might seem irregular at first glance.

<text>Westminster Under School is an independent preparatory school for boys aged 7 to 13, attached to Westminster School in London.

The school was founded in 1943 in the precincts of Westminster School in Little Dean&#x27;s Yard, just behind Westminster Abbey. In 1951 the Under School relocated to its own premises in Eccleston Square. Due to rising numbers of pupils in the 1960s and 1970s, the school moved again in 1981 to its present site, a former hospital, overlooking the Westminster School playing fields in Vincent Square. There are 285 pupils attending the school. The school has a strong musical tradition and provides choristers for St Margaret&#x27;s Church in Westminster Abbey. It also excels in sport, drama (having produced winners of the recent Shakespeare Schools Festival), chess and Latin. Most boys attending the school move on to Westminster School after the completion of either Common Entrance or Scholarship examinations (in the case of Westminster School, the Challenge), although a number of boys each year go on to other schools, including Eton.

The previous Master was Mark O&#x27;Donnell, who retired in 2020 due to ill health. Steve Bailey came out of his retirement in the 2020/21 academic year as an interim measure. The current Master is Kate Jefferson, who recently came back from maternity leave, during which the acting Master was Michael Woodside. There are 47 members of staff.

The school fees in 2025 (post the introduction of VAT on private school fees) were between £10,350 and £10,609 per term.

==History==
The Under School was founded in September 1943 at 2 Little Dean&#x27;s Yard (now known as Grant&#x27;s House) by the former Headmaster of Westminster School, John Traill Christie. 
There were only 6 teachers when the school was established and only 31 boys. Dean&#x27;s Yard was used as a playing field for the boys and the roofless remains of the school along with the bombed school hall were used as a playground. St Faith&#x27;s Chapel in Westminster Abbey served as the school chapel. For much of the Under School&#x27;s history, the final year (Year 8) was known as &quot;the Upper Remove&quot; and the second to last year (Year 7) was known as &quot;the Remove&quot;.

After the war, the school moved to its own premises in Eccleston Square, and in 1981 moved to its present site in Vincent Square to cope with expanding numbers.

==Entrance==
Competitive entrance examinations for Westminster Under School can be taken at 7+, 8+ or 11+. Entry to Westminster Under School at 11+ attracts many pupils from the state sector. At this stage, the school also offers Music Scholarships and means-tested bursaries.

===Previous school fees===
==Campus==
The school is housed in three buildings, listed below. As well as these buildings and the playing fields of Vincent Square, the school hires facilities at the Queen Mother Sports Centre in Victoria and at Battersea Park.

=== Adrian House ===

Adrian House is situated at 27 Vincent Square, a four-storey building in the south-east corner of Vincent Square in central London. It opened in 1951 and underwent a major rebuilding programme in 2001, when new classrooms, a new hall, an Art Department (which became more classrooms following the opening of George House) and an IT suite were built on the site of the old hall. In addition, all the classrooms and labs were refurbished. The hall, which would also serve as a canteen prior to the opening of 21 Douglas Street and space for P.E. prior to the opening of Lawrence Hall as Westminster School Sports Centre (see below), is used for theatre and drama performances by the school. It was refurbished in the 2014 and renamed the Performing Arts Studio. Adrian House provides access to two science laboratories and the basement is devoted entirely to the music department.

=== George House ===
George House, opposite Adrian House on 21 Douglas Street, opened in 2011 by the Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr John Hall. In 2014 it was given the name &quot;George House&quot;. The building houses the Under School&#x27;s Dining Room, Art Department, conference room, and staff meeting rooms.

=== Westminster School Sports Centre ===
In September 2012, the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Lawrence Hall was leased by Westminster School for 999 years, and became the School&#x27;s Sports Centre. It was officially opened by HM Elizabeth II in 2015. The building is located on Elverton Street, moments from Vincent Square. The Under School uses it for sport, including P.E. and Games, and Extras (see section below).

==Customs==
 The school, being attached to Westminster School, sends the oldest year of the school (Year 8) to take part in the annual pancake greaze on Shrove Tuesday. This is watched by the year below in the Great Hall. The school is Anglican and has a Thursday service in St Stephen&#x27;s Church, Rochester Row.

The school also holds an annual Music Competition each summer in which all boys may enter one piece of music for any instrument they play. The winners and some runners-up from the Years 7 and 8 finals of the competition are invited to play in the school&#x27;s annual Summer Concert in St John&#x27;s, Smith Square, as well as the school&#x27;s Senior String Orchestra, Senior Choir (made up of boys from Years 6, 7 and 8, also known as the Westminster Boys&#x27; Choir), the winning house choir and a number of instrumental ensembles.

There is also an annual reading competition, in which each boy chooses and optionally learns by heart a short piece of prose or poetry (fictional or otherwise), based on a given theme. The competition is held in the Lent term and is compulsory for each boy to enter. These are both house events, so points are given to houses for the results of the competition which are added to other points from other competitions or events, for trophies.

A photography competition and a model competition are held by the art department (both optional to enter). Before his recent retirement, there was also a general knowledge quiz, written by a Latin, Greek and sports teacher, S.R.H. James. S.R.H. James is also the author of the series, Latin I, Latin II and Latin III which until his retirement was used to teach Latin in the school. The quiz was held annually at the start of winter, and was scored out of 100. Boys who obtained a set mark (set for each year) are permitted to the second round. Boys who do well in the second round are entered to the SATIPS nationwide general knowledge quiz. The school’s pupils also compete regularly for the Townsend-Warner History Prize, a history competition for public schools.

==Curriculum==

===Years 3 and 4===
In Years 3 and 4, pupils are taught in most subjects by the same teacher (usually their form teacher), however they have specialist teachers in French, Music, Art and Design, IT, PE and Games. There is only one Year 3 form, typically of around 22 boys, and only 2 forms in Year 4 as the school typically accepts only 22 pupils per entry point. Until 2001, there was no Year 3 form, and the school accepted 42 boys into Year 4.

===Years 5 and 6===
In Year 5, the following subjects are taught, all by specialist teachers: Mathematics, English, Science, French, history, Geography, Religious Studies, Music, Art, Drama, IT, PE and Games but most are in their classroom. Year 5 were also formerly taught Roman and Greek mythology to prepare for when they start Latin in Year 6, however they have temporarily stopped. In Year 7, the boys are split into sets for Maths according to their performances in their Year 6 summer exams or 11+ entrance exams, depending on whether or not they were at the school in Year 6. When the list of boys who are to enter the school aged 11 the next year is confirmed, those boys begin to attend Saturday morning school so that they may begin to catch up in terms of curriculum with the Year 6s already at the school.

=== Year 7 ===
Another two forms are created for the 11+ entrance. In Year 7, the curriculum remains broadly the same as in Year 6.

===Year 8===
Going into Year 8, the year group is split into those who will take Common Entrance or a similar exam for their chosen future school and those who embark on what is known as the &quot;Scholarship Course&quot;, in which they prepare for scholarship papers to their chosen future schools. In Year 8, the boys are divided into four classes for each of humanities, science, languages and maths. Two of these forms are for those who will take Common Entrance, typically containing 18 or 19 boys each, and two other forms containing boys on the &quot;Scholarship Course&quot; – typically these forms will contain about 16 students each. One scholarship form will contain almost exclusively those preparing for the Challenge, the scholarship exam to Westminster School, whilst the other will also contain boys preparing for scholarship exams to other schools.

Greek is added as an additional subject in Year 8.

==Houses==
The school is organised into 4 houses, based on the charges on the Westminster Abbey, Westminster School and Westminster Under School coat of arms: Tudors (Red), Lions (Blue), Fleuries (Green) and Martlets (Yellow). There are regular inter-house competitions during the school year, including music, Scrabble and Chess. All the houses have a House Captain and Vice Captain who are changed every term. Up to 12 prefects are selected throughout the year from Year 8. This is done in such a way that most of Year 8 will be either a House Captain, Vice Captain, Head Boy or Prefect at some point during the year.

==Extras==
The school has many Extras (or clubs) boys can take part in. These extras include bridge, chess, swimming, fencing, judo, karate, mandarin, LAMDA, indoor and outdoor cricket, indoor football, cooking, photography, climbing, table tennis and outdoor tennis. Extras take place after school time.

<text>The Military Sealift Command (MSC) is an organization that controls the replenishment and military transport ships of the United States Navy. Military Sealift Command has the responsibility for providing sealift and ocean transportation for all US military services as well as for other government agencies. It first came into existence on 9 July 1949 when the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) became solely responsible for the Department of Defense&#x27;s ocean transport needs. The MSTS was renamed the Military Sealift Command in 1970.

Military Sealift Command ships are made up of a core fleet of ships owned by the United States Navy and others under long-term-charter augmented by short-term or voyage-chartered ships.

* During a time charter MSC takes control of a merchant ship and operates it for the chartered amount of time. During this time the ship is crewed by civilian mariners and MSC pays for all expenses. Time chartered ships are not subject to inspections from foreign governments when in port, and MSC has operational control.
* Voyage chartered ships are crewed by civilian mariners, and MSC only pays the fee for transporting the cargo. These ships are chartered for the voyage, subject to inspections, and MSC does not have operational control of the ship.

The Navy-owned ships carry blue and gold stack colors, are in service with the prefix USNS (United States Naval Ship), rather than in commission (with a USS prefix), have hull numbers as an equivalent commissioned ship would have with the prefix T- and are primarily civilian crewed by either civil service mariners or contract crews (see United States Merchant Marine) as is the case of the special mission ships. Some ships may have Navy or Marine Corps personnel on board to carry out communication and special mission functions, or for force protection. Ships on charter or equivalent, retain commercial colors and bear the standard merchant prefix [[Merchant vessel|MV]], [[steam ship|SS]], or [[Gas Turbine Ship#Marine applications|GTS]], without hull numbers.

Eight programs compose Military Sealift Command: Fleet Oiler (PM1), Special Mission (PM2), Strategic Sealift (PM3), Tow, Salvage, Tender, and Hospital Ship (PM4), Sealift (PM5), Combat Logistics Force (PM6), Expeditionary Mobile Base, Amphibious Command Ship, and Cable Layer (PM7) and Expeditionary Fast Transport (PM8).

MSC reports to the Department of Defense&#x27;s Transportation Command for defense transportation matters, to the Navy Fleet Forces Command for Navy-unique matters, and to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for procurement policy and oversight matters.

==Command structure==

Military Sealift Command is organized around eight programs:
* Fleet Oiler Program N031 (formerly Combat Logistics Force (PM1) or Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force NFAF)
* Special Mission Program N032 (formerly (PM2))
* Strategic Sealift Program N033 (Formerly Prepositioning (PM3)) 
* Tow, Salvage, Tender, and Hospital Ship Program N034 (Formerly Service Support (PM4)) 
* Sealift Program N035 (Formerly Sealift (PM5))
* Combat Logistics Force Program N036 (Formerly Fleet Ordnance and Dry Cargo (PM6))
* Expeditionary Mobile Base, Amphibious Command Ship, and Cable Layer Program N037 (Formerly Afloat Staging Command Support (PM7))
* Expeditionary Fast Transport Program N038 (Formerly Joint High Speed Vessel (PM8))

On 9 January 2012, the MSC command organization was reorganized via a realignment of its structure to increase its efficiency while maintaining effectiveness. To better manage this new program structure, MSC repositioned three of its key Senior Executive Service (SES) personnel, with one SES acting as the program executive over MSC&#x27;s government-operated ships, a second SES serving as the program executive over contract-operated ships, and a third SES overseeing total force manpower management for MSC worldwide operations. Also, MSC realigned two of its four mission-driven programs (Combat Logistics Force and Special Mission) and adding a fifth program (Service Support). The Prepositioning and Sealift programs are unchanged by the 2012 reorganization.

As of June 2013, Military Sealift Command operated around 110 ships, and employed 9,800 people (88% of whom are civilians).

In 2015, the Military Sealift Command underwent further restructuring with the relocation from the former headquarters at Washington Navy Yard to Naval Station Norfolk.

=== Fleet Oiler Program N031 ===

The Combat Logistics Force was the part of the MSC most associated with directly supporting the Navy. In 1972, a study concluded that it would be cheaper for civilians to man USN support vessels such as tankers and stores ships. The CLF is the American equivalent of the British Royal Fleet Auxiliary. These MSC ships are painted haze gray and can be easily identified by the blue and gold horizontal bands around the top of their central smokestack.

The Combat Logistics Force was formerly called the Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force. After a 2012 reorganization, this program now maintains the 32 government-operated fleet underway replenishment ships from the former Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force (NFAF). Fleet replenishment oilers form the Oilers Program N031, while the dry cargo/ammunition ships and fast combat support ships were separated to Explosive Program N036.

;Fleet Oiler Program ship types;
* Fleet Replenishment Oilers (T-AO) 
* Fleet Replenishment Oilers (T-AO) 

=== Special Mission Program N032 ===
Military Sealift Command&#x27;s Special Mission Program controls 24 ships that provide operating platforms and services for unique US Military and federal government missions. Oceanographic and hydrographic surveys, underwater surveillance, missile flight data collection and tracking, acoustic research and submarine support are among the specialized services this program supports. Special mission ships work for several different US Navy customers, including the Naval Sea Systems Command and the Oceanographer of the Navy. These ships like those of the NFAF are painted haze gray with blue and gold stack bands.

After a 2012 reorganization, this program now maintains all of its 24 contract-operated ships involved in missile range instrumentation, ocean surveillance, submarine and special warfare support, oceanographic survey, and navigation test support. Some of its ships were transferred to the new Service Support program.

;Special Mission ship types;
* Missile Range Instrumentation Ship (T-AGM)
* Navigation Test Support Ship (T-AGS)
* Ocean Surveillance Ships (T-AGOS)
* Oceanographic Survey Ships (T-AGS)
* Submarine and Special Warfare Support (T-AGSE)
* Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX)

=== Strategic Sealift Program N033 ===

Military Sealift Command&#x27;s Prepositioning Program is an element in the US&#x27;s triad of power projection into the 21st century—sea shield, sea strike and sea basing. As a key element of sea basing, afloat prepositioning provides the military equipment and supplies for a contingency forward deployed in key ocean areas before need. Part the prepositioning strategy is forward presence and power projection. Prepositioning extends the reach of operations, isolates conflicts away from the United States, allows for a swift response to conflict, and reduces time and resources delegated to transporting cargo. The MSC Prepositioning Program supports the US Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps and the Defense Logistics Agency. Prepositioning ships remain at sea, ready to deploy on short-notice the vital equipment, fuel and supplies to initially support military forces in the event of a contingency. The Prepositioning Program consists of 34 at-sea ships plus two aviation support ships kept in reduced operating status. These ships wear civilian livery, and are only designated &quot;USNS&quot; if government-owned; those chartered from civilian owners are either &quot;SS&quot; or &quot;MV&quot;. Two Dry Cargo/Ammunition Ships (T-AKE) are included in the program in a Reduced Operational Status (ROS).

;Strategic Sealift Program ship types;
* Air Force Container Ships (T-AK)
* Army Container Ships (T-AK)
* Dry Cargo/Ammunition Ships (T-AKE) 
* Aviation Logistics Support Ship (T-AVB)
* Break-Bulk Ships (T-AK)
* Large, Medium-Speed, Roll-On/Roll-Off Ships (T-AKR)
* Marine Corps Container and Roll-On/Roll-Off Ships (T-AK/T-AKR)
* Expeditionary Transfer Dock (T-ESD)

=== Tow, Salvage, Tender, and Hospital Ship Program N034 ===

Formerly Service Support (PM4) it consists of fleet ocean tugs, rescue and salvage ships, submarines tenders, and hospitals ships formerly from the NFAF. Command ships and cable layers were transferred to the N037 program.

;Service Support ship types;
* Fleet Ocean Tugs (T-ATF)
* Rescue/Salvage Ships (T-ARS)
* Submarine Tender (AS)
* Hospital Ships (T-AH)

=== Sealift Program N035 ===
The mission of the Sealift Program is to provide ocean transportation to the Department of Defense by meeting its sealift requirements in peace, contingency, and war with quality, efficient cost effective assets and centralized management. This is achieved through the use of commercial charter vessels, Large, Medium-Speed Roll-on/Roll-off ships, and the Maritime Administration&#x27;s Ready Reserve Force, including the eight former MSC fast sealift ships. Sealift is divided into three separate project offices: Tanker Project Office, Dry Cargo Project Office and the Surge Project Office.

;Sealift Program Ship Types;
* Dry Cargo Ships (T-AK)
* Large, Medium-Speed, Roll-On/Roll-Off Ships (T-AKR)
* Tankers (T-AOT)

=== Combat Logistics Force Program N036 ===
Formerly the Fleet Ordnance and Dry Cargo (PM6), it is composed of twelve Dry Cargo/Ammunition ships and two Fast Combat Support ships. Dry Cargo and Ammunition ships, or T-AKEs, were designed to replenish dry and refrigerated stores as well as ordnance. They have replaced combat stores ships and ammunition ships incorporating the capabilities of both platforms into one hull. These multi-product ships increase the delivery capability to provide food, fuel, spare parts, ammunition and potable water to the U.S. Navy and allies&#x27; ships. Fast Combat Support Ships or T-AOEs provide parts, supplies and fuel at sea.

;Combat Logistics Force Ship Types;
* Dry Cargo/Ammunition Ships (T-AKE) 
* Fast Combat Supply (T-AOE)

=== Expeditionary Mobile Base, Amphibious Command Ship, and Cable Layer Program N037 ===
Formerly the Afloat Staging Command Support (PM7) program, it is composed of the Expeditionary Mobile Base ships (replacement for the Afloat Forward Staging Base), the Amphibious Command Ship , and the cable layer .

;Afloat Staging Command Support Program Ship Types;
* Expeditionary Mobile Base (ESB) – (ESD subvariant)
* Amphibious command ship (LCC)
* Cable layer (T-ARC)

=== Expeditionary Fast Transport Program N038 ===

This consists of the class of ships formerly known as the Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV) program but was changed to (EPF) in September 2015. The Expeditionary Fast Transport (EPF) program is a cooperative effort for a high-speed, shallow draft vessel intended for rapid intratheater transport of medium-sized cargo payloads. The EPF will reach speeds of 35–45 knots (65–83 km/h; 40–52 mph) and will allow for the rapid transit and deployment of conventional or special forces as well as equipment and supplies.

==Area commands==
MSC headquarters is located at Naval Station Norfolk in Norfolk, VA. As a result of a 2012 organization, MSC&#x27;s 12 worldwide MSC ship support units (SSUs) will now report to the MSC operational area commands in their respective areas of responsibility. These are responsible for crewing, training, equipping and maintaining MSC&#x27;s government-owned, government-operated ships.
* MSC Atlantic in Norfolk. In October 2013, the MSCLANT Task Force Designator changed from CTF-23 to CTF-83. Missions, functions and tasks remained unchanged.
* MSC Pacific in San Diego
* MSC Europe &amp; Africa in Naples
* MSC Central in Bahrain
* MSC Far East in Singapore
Formerly, these SSUs had reported to MSC&#x27;s Military Sealift Fleet Support Command (MSFSC), a subordinate command of Military Sealift Command and is a single Type Commander (TYCOM) execution command having worldwide responsibility to crew, train, equip and maintain MSC government-owned, government-operated ships. MSFSC officially stood up on 13 November 2005. Stand up of the Ship Support Units (SSUs) followed establishment of MSFSC, their parent command. SSU San Diego stood up in conjunction with MSFSC. By late 2008, all subordinate SSUs were fully operational.

MSFSC was formed from the following MSC elements: Portions of Sealift Logistics Command Atlantic and the former Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force East; Portions of Sealift Logistics Command Pacific; Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force West (except those positions remaining in SSU San Diego); and The Afloat Personnel Management Center.

MSFSC was also responsible for providing support to other MSC assets as directed. MSFSC has ship support units, or SSUs, in Naples, Bahrain, Singapore, Guam, Yokohama and San Diego. The SSUs (except for Guam and Yokohama) are collocated with their respective numbered fleet operational logistics task force commanders and Sealift Logistics Commands, but are not within that chain of command. SSUs provide local TYCOM support to ships in their area of operations and report directly to MSFSC. MSFSC was disestablished following restructuring when Military Sealift Command relocated to Naval Station Norfolk from the Washington Navy Yard.

Sealift&#x27;s capabilities are significantly hampered by biofouling. Maintenance is sometimes performed to remove fouling, but sealift maintenance must follow the Uniform National Discharge Standards for the chemicals used in this process.

==History==
===Military sea transportation prior to 1949===
As early as 1847, both the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy chartered American merchant ships separately. Following the Mexican–American War, Brigadier General Thomas S. Jesup, Quartermaster of the Army, recommended that the Navy be given responsibility for all water transportation requirements for the military. However, each service managed their own sea transportation throughout the nineteenth century and both World Wars.

In World War II, four government agencies conducted military sealift functions, the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS), the Army Transport Service, the U.S. Maritime Commission&#x27;s War Shipping Administration, and the Fleet Support Services. To oversee these organizations, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) established the Joint Military Transportation Command.

===Military Sea Transportation Service===
On 15 December 1948, the Secretary of Defense James Forrestal issued a statement, &quot;all military sea transport including Army transports would be placed under Navy command.&quot; Issues with funding held up the transfer of the functions to the Navy. The new Secretary of Defense, Louis Johnson, issued a memorandum on 12 July 1949 that detailed service responsibilities and the funding of the new Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS).

MSTS became the single managing agency for the Department of Defense&#x27;s ocean transportation needs. The command assumed responsibility for providing sealift and ocean transportation for all military services as well as for other government agencies. The new command set up subcomponents, for example, Military Sea Transportation Service Pacific (ComMSTSPac).

Nine months after its creation, MSTS responded to the challenge of the Korean War. On 6 July 1950, eleven days after the initial invasion of South Korea by North Korean troops, MSTS deployed the 24th Infantry Division for duty in Japan to Pusan, South Korea. In addition to transporting troops and combat equipment to and from Korea, command ships supplied US bases and Distant Early Warning line construction sites and supported US nation building efforts from Europe and Africa, to the Far East.

The 1960s brought the conflict in Southeast Asia. From 1965 to 1969 MSTS moved almost 54 million tons of combat equipment and supplies and almost 8 million long tons of fuel to South Vietnam. The Vietnam War era also marked the last use of MSC troop ships for personnel movement. Currently, most US troops are prepositioned by air.

===Military Sealift Command===
MSTS was renamed Military Sealift Command (MSC) in 1970. In 1971 Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo Zumwalt proposed the use of MSC ships for direct support of the fleet at sea. Heretofore, these civilian-crewed ships had only been used for point to point transport of cargo. To determine the feasibility of this concept, Admiral Zumwalt directed the formation of a special study group to recommend how the navy could better utilize the MSC fleet to save both manpower and money. The high cost of training personnel after the advent of the all-volunteer navy made it imperative that seagoing personnel be assigned to complex warships of the fleet whenever possible. The study concluded that significant savings could be achieved if civilian mariners could be substituted for uniformed navy sailors in fleet support ships.

In 1972 a joint U.S. Navy-Maritime Administration project called &quot;Charger Log&quot; was established to test whether or not a union-crewed merchant ship could provide some or all of the fleet support services normally provided by navy oilers. Extensive trials were conducted using the civilian crewed merchant tanker SS Erna Elizabeth equipped with both alongside and astern fueling gear to test the feasibility of augmenting (not replacing) the service force with ships of the U.S. Merchant Marine. The success of &#x27;Charger Log&#x27; contributed to the formation of the Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force.

The navy oiler was the first fleet-support ship to be placed under MSC control. Decommissioned on 4 May 1972, she was transferred to the MSC and redesignated T-AO-62. After its transfer, the ship underwent a thorough overhaul that included refurbishment of equipment, gear, and refueling rigs, modification of crew quarters, and the removal of armaments. She entered service with a crew of 105 civilian mariners hired by the government augmented by a sixteen-member naval complement.

The shortage of multiproduct replenishment ships in the early 1970s led to the development of an improvised system for dispensing fuel from ammunition and stores ships that allowed them to transfer fuel to smaller combatants. Neither type of ship had cargo fuel, but each could share its own fuel with destroyers and frigates in an emergency. The lack of sufficient numbers of AOEs or AORs precluded the deployment of these types in support of any of the surface warfare groups, which were generally composed of destroyers and frigates. The old saying that necessity is the mother of invention proved to be true when Rear Admiral John Johnson devised a practical solution to the shortage of fuel-carrying UNREP ships based on the modification of existing cargo transfer gear on ammunition and stores ships. As commander Task Force 73 (the service force of the Seventh Fleet) in 1973, Admiral Johnson had to contend with the problem of how to provide logistic support for the two Seventh Fleet destroyers deployed to the Indian Ocean for an extended period of time. The answer was to turn the into a mini multiproduct ship by adding two cargo reefer boxes as deck cargo and outfitting it with a jury-rigged fuel station. The latter was achieved by temporarily rigging a 7-inch fuel hose to the starboard side cargo station—the one closest to the ship&#x27;s fuel receiving raiser. The highline was used as a span wire, and fuel hose saddles were supported from a wire whip from a nearby hauling winch or a fiber whip from a nearby gypsy. Fuel was pumped from the ship&#x27;s own fuel bunkers to the receiving ship alongside using the fuel-transfer pump normally carried aboard the AE. The pumping rate was considerably less than that of a fleet oiler and, while workable, contained many drawbacks.

By the time the entered service on 19 December 1986, the Navy had transferred the five Second World War vintage tankers of the &quot;Mispillion&quot; class and the six 1950s-built &quot;Neosho&quot;-class fleet oilers to the Military Sealift Command.

Through the 1970s and 1980s MSC provided the Department of Defense with ocean transportation. During the first Persian Gulf War, consisting of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, MSC distinguished itself as the largest source of defense transportation of any nation involved. Command resources delivered more than 12 million tons (11 million metric tonnes) of wheeled and tracked vehicles, helicopters, ammunition, dry cargo, fuel and other supplies and equipment during the war. At the high point of the war, more than 230 government-owned and chartered ships delivered the largest part of the international arsenal that defeated Saddam Hussein in Iraq. MSC was also involved in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, delivering of cargo and of fuel by the end of the first year.

In August 2017, the Government Accountability Office issued a report detailing readiness issues that limited at-sea mission capabilities, prompting an investigation from the Department of Defense&#x27;s Inspector General.

==List of commanders==
==Notable ships==
History Military Sealift Command operated former ships of the U.S. Navy, which upon decommissioning changes prefixes from United States Ship (USS) to United States Naval Ship (USNS). In rare instances, ships were transferred from MSC to the U.S. Navy, being commissioned and receiving the USS-prefix.
* was launched in 1957 and delivered to the Military Sea Transportation Service as a Cargo Ship Dock. She was later extensively modified and in 1974 reclassified a &quot;Deep Submergence Support Ship&quot; and renamed USS &quot;Point Loma&quot; (AGDS-2).
* USNS &quot;Lewis B. Puller&quot; (T-ESB 3) is the first purpose-built Expeditionary Mobile Base (previously Mobile Landing Platform, then Afloat Forward Staging Base) vessel for the United States Navy. She was delivered to Military Sealift Command in 2015, then later commissioned on 17 August 2017 in Bahrain, with her prefix changing from USNS to USS and her hull designation changing from T-ESB-3 to ESB-3.[10] She is the first overseas commissioning of a U.S. Navy warship.
* was an &quot;Austin&quot;-class amphibious transport dock (LPD) commissioned in 1970 fitted with an additional superstructure level for command ship duties. In 2003 she was decommissioned, re-designated as USNS &quot;Coronado&quot; (T-AGF-11) with the intention of being operated by a civilian MSC crew. It was concluded shortly thereafter that the operations the ship engaged in required her to be a USS warship and thus she was transferred back to the Navy and recommissioned. She was finally decommissioned for the last time in 2006 and was later used for a SINKEX in 2012.
* was an &quot;Austin&quot;-class amphibious transport dock (LPD) commissioned in 1971, and was planned for decommissioning in 2012, but was converted at short notice into the Afloat Forward Staging Base and operated by Military Sealift Command. She was relieved by the USNS &quot;Lewis B. Puller&quot; (T-ESB-3) in 2017, after which she was finally retired after 46 years of service.
* USS &quot;Card&quot; (CVE-11) was a &quot;Bogue&quot;-class escort aircraft carrier laid down in 1941 as a C-3 cargo ship, then acquired from the Maritime Commission while under construction and converted into an escort carrier, and decommissioned after World War 2. In 1958 she was placed into service with Military Sea Transportation Service as a civilian aircraft transport and later sunk pierside after being attacked by the Viet Cong in the Vietnam War, killing five civilian crew members.
* was a &quot;Cimarron&quot;-class fleet oiler acquired by the U.S. Navy during World War II. In 1972 she was decommissioned and turned over to the Military Sealift Command for civilian operation as USNS &quot;Taluga&quot; (T-AO-62) in a then-experimental use of the Military Sea Transportation Service&#x27;s ability.
* USNS LCPL Roy M. Wheat (T-AK-3016) was originally launched in 1987 by the Black Sea Shipyard in Mykolaiv, Ukrainian SSSR as the GTS &quot;Vladimir Vaslyayev&quot;, she was acquired in 1997 by the US Navy and began conversion in 2001 for transfer to the Military Sealift Command, in 2003 this conversion was completed and she was renamed in honor of US Marine and Medal of Honor recipient Roy M. Wheat. The conversion process included a 118 ft midbody hull extension, the installation of two cargo cranes, installation of fore and aft garages, strengthening and increasing the length of the stern ramp, a stern helicopter deck, conversion of the electrical system from 50  Hz to 60  Hz, the replacement of the ship&#x27;s generator and electrical switching gear replacement, new Vosper-Thornycroft machinery control systems, new and larger accommodations, and climate control systems for the cargo holds. LCPL Roy M. Wheat left service and was struck December 30, 2021

<text>The Curonian (Courish) Spit (; ) is a long, thin, curved sand-dune spit that separates the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site shared by Lithuania and Russia. Its southern portion lies within Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia, and its northern within southwestern Klaipėda County of Lithuania.

== Geography ==

The Curonian Spit stretches from the Sambia Peninsula on the south to its northern tip next to a narrow strait, across which is the port city of Klaipėda on the Lithuanian mainland. The northern long stretch of the Curonian Spit peninsula lies in Klaipėda County, Lithuania, while the rest is part of Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia. The width of the spit varies from a minimum of in Russia (near the village of Lesnoy) to a maximum of in Lithuania (just north of Nida).

== Geologic history ==
The Curonian Spit was formed about 3rd millennium BC. A glacial moraine served as its foundation; winds and sea currents later contributed enough sand to raise and keep the formation above sea level.

The existence of this narrow shoal is inherently threatened by the natural processes that govern shoreline features. It depends on a dynamic balance between sand transport and deposition. Geologically it is an ephemeral coast element. The most likely development is that the shallow bay inside the Curonian Spit will eventually fill up with sediment, thus creating new land.

== Human history ==
=== Mythology ===

According to folk etymology for the name of Neringa Municipality, there was a giantess girl named Neringa, who formed the Curonian Spit and helped fishermen.

=== Medieval period ===
From c. 800 to 1016, the Spit was the location of Kaup, a major pagan trading centre which has not yet been excavated. The Teutonic Knights occupied the area in the 13th century, building their castles at Memel (1252), Neuhausen (1283), and at Rossitten (1372). After the Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–1466), the spit became part of a Polish fief held by the Teutonic Knights. The spit may have been the home of the last living speaker of now-extinct Old Prussian, one of the Baltic languages.

=== Kursenieki habitation ===

Significant human impacts on the area began in the 16th century. From the 18th century, it was part of the Kingdom of Prussia. Deforestation of the spit due to overgrazing, timber harvesting, and building of boats for the Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf in 1757 led to the dunes taking over the spit and burying entire villages. Alarmed by these problems, the Prussian government sponsored large-scale revegetation and reforestation efforts, which started in 1825. Owing to these efforts, much of the spit is now covered with forests.

In the 19th century the Curonian Spit was inhabited primarily by Kursenieki, with a significant German minority in the south and a Lithuanian minority in the north. The population of Kursenieki eventually dwindled due to assimilation and other reasons; it is close to non-existent these days.

=== Artists&#x27; colony ===

From the late 19th century, the dune landscape around Nidden (Nida) became popular with landscape and animal painters from the &quot;Kunstakademie Königsberg&quot; arts school. The local inn of Herman Blode was the nucleus of the expressionist artists&#x27; colony (&quot;Künstlerkolonie Nidden&quot;). Lovis Corinth stayed here in 1890, followed by artists such as Max Pechstein, Alfred Lichtwark, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, and Alfred Partikel. Painters from Königsberg such as Julius Freymuth visited the area, as did poets like Ernst Wiechert and Carl Zuckmayer. Other guests included Ernst Kirchner, and Franz Domscheit.

=== 20th century ===

From 1901 to 1946 the village of Rossitten, now Rybachy, became the site of the Rossitten Bird Observatory, founded by German ornithologist Johannes Thienemann there because of the Spit&#x27;s importance as a bird migration corridor.

After World War I, Nidden, together with the northern half of the Curonian Spit became part of the Klaipėda Region according to the 1919 Treaty of Versailles and was annexed by Lithuania in 1923. Officially renamed Nida, the village nevertheless remained a German-majority settlement – the border with the remaining East Prussian half of the Spit lay only a few kilometres to the south.

In 1929 Nobel Prize-winning writer Thomas Mann visited Nida while on holiday in nearby Rauschen and decided to have a summer house erected on a hill above the Lagoon, mocked as &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (&quot;Onkel Toms Hütte&quot;) by locals. He and his family spent the summers of 1930–1932 in the thatched cottage; parts of the novel &quot;Joseph and His Brothers&quot; (&quot;Joseph und seine Brüder&quot;) were written here. Threatened by the Nazis, Mann left Germany after Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Machtergreifung&quot; in 1933 and never returned to Nida. After the Klaipėda Region was again annexed by Nazi Germany in 1939, his house was seized at the behest of Hermann Göring and served as a recreation home for &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; officers.

Following World War II, the Memelland and its part of the spit was restored to Lithuania, while the remainder fell to Russia. The German population was expelled after the war by the occupying Soviet forces in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. Like elsewhere in present-day Kaliningrad Oblast, the assimilation of the territory and colonization by Russian settlers was completed by changing the historic German toponyms to Russian ones throughout the Russian-controlled part of the Spit.

=== Today ===
After the breakup of the Soviet Union, tourism flourished; many Germans, mostly the descendants of the inhabitants of the area, choose the Curonian Spit (especially Nida, as no visas are needed for Germans in Lithuania) as their holiday destination.
In 2019 the making of Curonian Lagoon Boats’ Weathervanes was inscribed into The Intangible Cultural Heritage Inventory of Lithuania as a form of folk art, traditional craftsmanship or agricultural activities.

== Kursenieki ==

While today the Kursenieki, also known as Kuršininkai, are a nearly extinct Baltic ethnic group living along the Curonian Spit, in 1649 Kuršininkai settlement spanned from Memel (Klaipėda) to Gdańsk. The Kuršininkai were eventually assimilated by the Germans, except along the Curonian Spit where some still live. The Kuršininkai were considered Latvians until after World War I, when Latvia gained independence from the Russian Empire, a consideration based on linguistic arguments. This was the rationale for Latvian claims over the Curonian Spit, Memel and other territories of Prussia, which would be later dropped.

== Current state ==

The Curonian Spit is home to the highest moving (drifting) sand dunes in Europe. Their average height is , but some attain a height of . Several ecological communities are present on and near the Spit, from its outer beaches to dune ridges, wetlands, meadows, and forests. Its location on the East Atlantic Flyway means it is frequently visited by migratory waterfowl. Between 10 and 20 million birds fly over the feature during spring and autumn migrations, and many pause to rest or breed there.

Both the Russian and Lithuanian parts of the spit are national parks.

The settlements of the Curonian Spit (from north to south) are:

* Smiltynė
* Alksnynė
* Juodkrantė
* Pervalka
* Preila
* Nida
* Morskoe
* Rybachy
* Lesnoy

The first six are on the Lithuanian side, while the last three are on the Russian side. The Russian side of the Curonian Spit belongs to Zelenogradsky District of the Kaliningrad Oblast, while the Lithuanian side is partitioned among Klaipėda city municipality and Neringa municipality in Klaipėda County.

There is a single road that traverses the whole length of the Curonian Spit. Car ferries provide a transportation link between Smiltynė, located on the spit, and the port town of Klaipėda.

Since 2000, the Curonian Spit has been on UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage List under cultural criteria &quot;V&quot; (&quot;an outstanding example of a traditional human settlement, land-use, or sea-use which is representative of a culture [...], or human interaction with the environment especially when it has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change&quot;).

As of March 2012, there was a demand to demolish a number of homes on the Curonian Spit. These homes are owned by people who were given permits to build by corrupt local government officials. The demand to demolish the homes down is due to the Spit being a UN World Heritage Site, and the only structures that were to be allowed outside official settlements were fishing huts.

== Tourism ==

The largest town on the spit is Nida in Lithuania, a holiday resort, mostly frequented by Lithuanian and German tourists.

=== Parnidis dune and sundial ===

Parnidis sand dune, subjected to drift by harsh winds, is rising up to above sea level. Local residents believe that the name &quot;Parnidis&quot; comes from the phrase meaning &quot;passed across Nida&quot;, because this wind-blown dune has several times passed through the village of Nida. Scientists estimated that each person climbing or descending on the steep dune slopes moves several tons of sand, so hikers are allowed to climb only in designated paths.

There is a granite sundial built on Parnidis dune in 1995 that accurately shows the time. The sundial was rebuilt in 2011 following storm damage. The sundial is a stone pillar high and weighing . It consists in small steps covered with granite slabs, carved with hour and half-hour notches, as well as one notch for each month, and four additional notches for solstices and equinoxes. From the astronomical point of view Parnidis dune is an ideal place for the sundial in Lithuania.

== Environmental concerns ==

There are environmental concerns related to the Curonian Spit, which is often promoted as a refuge of clean nature.

Due to the importance of tourism and fishing for the regional economy, pollution of sea and coastlines may have disastrous effects for the area as the unique nature and the economy would be damaged.

The construction of an offshore drilling facility (the Kravtsovskoye (D-6) oilfield) in the territorial waters of Russia, from the coastline of the Curonian Spit raised concerns over possible oil spills. Between 2002 and 2005 local environmentalists in Kaliningrad Oblast and Lithuania protested against Lukoil&#x27;s plans to exploit the oilfield, objecting to the possible great damage to the environment and tourism (a vital source of income in the area) in case of oil leakage. These concerns did not engender support in the government of Russia. They were, however, supported by the government of Lithuania. The oilfield is about from the boundary of Lithuanian territorial waters; the prevailing northward currents means that the Lithuanian coastlines would receive much potential damage in case of leakage. Opposition to the operation of D-6 met little international support, and the oil platform was opened in 2004. During the first decade of the 21st century the two states agreed to a joint environmental impact assessment of the D-6 project, including plans for oil spill mitigation. The assessment and mitigation project had not been completed as of 2010.

Another concern is that increased tourism destroys the very nature that attracts it. For this reason, protective measures have been taken, such as banning tourists from hiking in certain areas of the spit.

Natural hazards are more dangerous in the Curonian Spit than elsewhere in Lithuania or the Kaliningrad Oblast. For example, storms tend to be stronger there. Due to the importance of trees in preventing soil erosion, forest fires that happen in summer are more dangerous to the ecology.

<doc id="528563" wikidata="Q3491978" url="?curid=528563" title="ISDN User Part">
<text>The ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) User Part or ISUP is part of Signaling System No. 7 (SS7), which is used to set up telephone calls in the public switched telephone network (PSTN). It is specified by the ITU-T as part of the Q.76x series.

When a telephone call is set up from one subscriber to another, several telephone exchanges could be involved, possibly across international boundaries. To allow a call to be set up correctly, where ISUP is supported, a switch will signal call-related information like called party number to the next switch in the network using ISUP messages.

The telephone exchanges may be connected via T1 or E1 trunks which transport the speech from the calls. These trunks are divided into 64 kbit/s timeslots, and one timeslot can carry exactly one call. Regardless of what facilities are used to interconnect switches, each circuit between two switches is uniquely identified by a circuit identification code (CIC) that is included in the ISUP messages. The exchange uses this information along with the received signaling information (especially the called party number) to determine which inbound and outbound circuits should be connected together to provide an end to end speech path.

In addition to call related information, ISUP is also used to exchange status information for, and permit management of, the available circuits. In the case of no outbound circuit being available on a particular exchange, a release message is sent back to the preceding switches in the chain.

== ISUP variants ==
Different ISUP variants exist. ITU-T specifies the variant used in the international network. In Europe ETSI releases its own ISUP specification which is close that of the ITU-T. ITU-T ISUP is used for international connections and is the base for some national ISUP variants. Most countries have their own variation of ISUP to cover national requirements. ANSI specifies variations of ISUP utilized under the North American Numbering Plan; however, some countries under the NANP differ in their support of some procedures (for example, LATA is meaningless within Canada. Also, RBOCs support Telcordia procedures not fully specified by ANSI.) Some countries outside the NANP support ANSI-based variants (e.g. Mexico).

While these variations of ISUP differ in subtle ways, the vast majority of ISUP message type, parameter type, and parameter field code-points, and related fundamental call processing procedures, agree across all variants.

=== ITU-T specification versions ===
* 1980 – ISUP Yellow Book
* 1984 – ISUP Red Book
* 1988 – ISUP Blue Book
* 1991 – ISUP Q.767
* 1992 – ISUP&#x27;92 White Book (segmentation, compatibility, new supplementary services)
* 1997 – ISUP&#x27;97 (new procedures, IN CS1, new supplementary services)

According to ITU-T Q.761 section 2.4.1 &quot;ISUP interworking&quot; ISUP&#x27;92 is backwards compatible with ISUP Blue Book and Q.767 for basic call procedures and supplementary services except for some procedures (e.g. number portability). Additionally the compatibility features introduced in this version ensure forward compatibility with newer versions.

== Message types ==
An ISUP message contains a fixed header containing the circuit identification code and the ISUP message type, followed by a mandatory fixed-length parameter part, a mandatory variable-length parameter part, and an optional parameter part that are dependent on the type of message being sent. ISUP messages can be sent using the services of the Message Transfer Part, or, less often, the Signalling Connection Control Part. These messages are transmitted in various stages of call setup and release. The most common messages are:
*Initial address message (IAM) — First message sent to inform the partner switch that a call has to be established on the CIC contained in the message. Contains the called number, type of service (speech or data) and optional parameters.
*Subsequent address message (SAM) — For networks that support &quot;overlap&quot; dialing procedures, and then in the case that the IAM did not contain the full called number, one or more SAMs follow containing additional digits. This message is not supported by networks that only support &quot;en bloc&quot; dialing procedures.
*Address complete message (ACM) — Message returned from the terminating switch when the subscriber is reached and the phone starts ringing, or when the call traverses an interworking point and the intermediate trunk is seized.
*Call progress (CPG) — Contains additional information about the progress of a call. Normally sent after the ACM when the status of the call changes from that reported in the ACM.
*Answer message (ANM) — Sent when the subscriber picks up the phone, a resource is connected or answer supervision is returned by an interworking point. Normally charging starts at this moment. It is required that the call be cut through in both directions by this point.
*Connect (CON) — Sent when the call is answered by an automatic terminal. This message replaces the ACM, CPG and ANM for calls that are answered by automatic terminals.
*Release (REL) — Sent to clear the call when a subscriber goes on hook. This is also sent (in direct response to an IAM) if the terminating switch determines that the call cannot be completed. In either case, the terminating switch provides a cause value in the message to explain the reason for the release, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;User busy&quot;.
*Release complete (RLC) — Acknowledgment of the release – the circuit is idle afterward and can be used again.

== Sample call flow ==
This is a very basic call flow involving only two telecom switches which exchange the ISUP messages. The subscriber interfaces are not covered here and are only listed for a better understanding.

== Cause codes ==
Release cause codes are used to identify and debug any events occurring in ISDN User Part signaling. Every event in ISUP signaling generates a cause code number. Even for a normal ISUP call, a cause code is generated. There are lot of applications developed based on the cause code from ISUP signaling. Similarly Telecom operators trace for Causecodes to debug any call failures.

Following are the list of cause codes used. Cause codes only defined by number are effectively undefined, and may be used for proprietary solutions.

== Message format ==
The &quot;Signalling Information Field (SIF)&quot; for all ISUP Message Signal Units (MSU) contain the following components:
* Routing Label
* Circuit Identification Code
* Message Type
* Mandatory Fixed Part
* Mandatory Variable Part
* Optional Part

The &quot;Routing Label&quot; indicates the Point Codes of the originating and destination nodes in the network; it also includes the Signalling Link Selection field that is used to select between the multiple routes an MSU could take between two nodes.

The &quot;Circuit Identification Code&quot; is used to specify which trunk between two switches is used to carry a particular call. Note that some versions of ANSI ISUP permit a CIC with 14 significant bits instead of the 12 that are shown.
# The &quot;Message Type&quot; indicates the ISUP message type. The presence and form of the remaining 3 components are determined by this message type.
# The &quot;Mandatory fixed part&quot;, when present, contains the mandatory, fixed-length parameters associated with the message type.
# The &quot;Mandatory variable part&quot;, when present, contains the mandatory, variable-length parameters associated with the message type.
# The &quot;Optional part&quot;, when present, contains the optional parameters permitted to be included in the message type.

When sent using the services of the Signalling Connection Control Part, ISUP messages passed to SCCP in the User Data parameter (NSDU) consist of only the last 4 components (&quot;Message Type, Mandatory fixed part, Mandatory variable part, Optional part&quot;). The routing label and circuit identification code are not included in the user data passed to SCCP.

<doc id="528565" wikidata="Q698651" url="?curid=528565" title="Józef Haller">
<text>Józef Haller von Hallenburg (13 August 1873 – 4 June 1960) was a Polish lieutenant general and legionary in the Polish Legions during the First World War. He was a harcmistrz (the highest Scouting instructor rank in Poland), the president of the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association (ZHP), and a political and social activist. He was also the cousin of Stanisław Haller.

Haller was born in Jurczyce. He studied at Vienna&#x27;s Technical Military Academy and subsequently (1895–1906) served with the Austrian Army, resigning after reaching the rank of captain. He supported the paramilitary pro-independence Polish organization Sokół. In 1916, during the First World War, he became commander of the Second Brigade of the Polish Legion, in particular the units which fought against Russia on the Eastern Front.

In 1918, in the aftermath of the &quot;Charge at Rarańcza&quot;, as commander of the 2nd Polish Auxiliary Corps with the Austrian Army, Haller broke through the Austro-Russian front line to Ukraine, where he united his troops with Polish detachments which had left the Tsarist army. He protested the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and continued to fight the Russians with his II Brigade of the Polish Legions (later, the 4th and 5th Rifle Divisions of the Polish II Corps). Under the pressure of the Germans, who after the Peace of Brest-Litovsk regarded the presence of Polish troops in Ukraine as illegal, and a fierce battle between Poles and Germans at Kaniów (10 May 1918, 2500 casualties) his corps was interned, while the Brigadier himself managed to escape to Moscow.

Subsequently, by the way of Murmansk, he arrived in France in July 1918, where on behalf of the Polish National Committee he created what was known as the Blue Army (from the color of its French uniforms, also known as &quot;Haller&#x27;s Army&quot;). For the next few months his army, allied to the Entente, would fight against Germany. In 1919, at the new army&#x27;s head, he arrived in Poland and was dispatched to the Ukrainian front. During the Polish-Soviet War he commanded an army of volunteers. He was also Inspector General of the Army and a member of the War Council.

In 1920–1927 Haller was a deputy to the Sejm. After the election of Gabriel Narutowicz as President of the Republic in December 1922, Haller fell into disfavor. After the 1926 May Coup, he was ordered into retirement. He co-organized an opposition party, the &quot;Front Morges&quot;.

At the time of the invasion of Poland (1939), Haller was living abroad. From 1940 to 1943 he served as Minister of Education in Władysław Sikorski&#x27;s government. After 1945 he settled in London as an exile and did not take active part in any émigré Polish political activities.

==Early life==

Haller was born 13 August 1873 in a small village called Jurczyce near Kraków (Skawina Municipal), in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Józef was the third child of a szlachta (Polish nobility) Henryk Haller von Hallenburg and Olga Treter. Jan Haller, a bookseller and the owner of the first printing house in Poland in the 16th century, was one of his ancestors. Józef Haller&#x27;s father took part in the failed January Uprising against the partitioning powers and his maternal grandfather was a captain in the Polish Army during the infamous November Uprising. He was also awarded the Virtuti Militari Knight&#x27;s Cross.

Józef spent his early childhood in the countryside where up to the age of nine he grew up with his brothers and sisters. Like other family members, he belonged to the Catholic organizations such as Sodality of Our Lady (&quot;Sodalicja Mariańska&quot;), which popularized the veneration of the Virgin Mary, and the Third Secular Franciscan Order. Strong patriotism and religiousness were deeply rooted in Haller&#x27;s family life and strongly influenced young Józef. Those family values – patriotism and religion – which shaped his personality, determined his future decisions.

In 1882 the Haller family moved to the city of Lemberg (Lwów) where Józef attended a local German gymnasium. He subsequently continued his education in the military Lower Realschule (secondary school) in Kaschau, Hungary (present-day Slovakia) and then in the Higher Realschule in Weisskirchen in Moravia, which was also attended to by some Austrian archdukes and European royalty. Afterwards, he studied at the Faculty of Artillery at Vienna&#x27;s Theresian Military Academy.

==Austro-Hungarian Army==

When Józef Haller graduated from the university he was designated the rank of Second Lieutenant and then started his 15-year-long service with the Austro-Hungarian Army. Between 1895 and 1910 he served with the 11th Artillery Regiment in Lviv. In 1903 Józef married Aleksandra Sala and in 1906 his son Eryk was born.

In 1910 Józef resigned from the Austro-Hungarian Army stating that &quot;since he had reached the rank of captain and he is not able to learn anything new in the Austrian Artillery, he leaves the army in order to serve the country in some other way until his Homeland needs him.&quot;

==Social work==
After dropping out of the army, Haller dedicated himself to social work. He was an active member of a farmers cooperative movement where he achieved remarkable successes. In 1912 he took up a post as the inspector in Farmer&#x27;s Association (Towarzystwo Kółek Rolniczych). His duties included organizing agricultural, farm and dairy courses. He was also a member of the Scouting Movement and Polish Gymnastic Society &quot;Falcon&quot; (Sokół) which was founded in 1911. Some of his priorities there were to militarize &quot;Falcon&quot; and polonize the Scouting Movement and then transform it into &quot;harcerstwo&quot; which is a Polish equivalent of Scouting (the primary difference between most Scouting organizations and the Polish Harcerstwo was described by Andrzej Małkowski as &quot;Harcerstwo is Scouting plus independence&quot;).

Since mid 1912 Haller had worked as a military trainer: he set up Falcon teams, organized secret soldier, non-commissioned officer and officer courses for the Polish youth. In 1913 along with other colleagues he worked out model badges and terminology for &quot;harcerstwo&quot;, many of which are still used today. He made a major contribution to creating the Scouts Cross where he suggested combining some elements of the Maltese Cross and the Polish Virtuti Militari Order.

==World War I==

===The Eastern Legion===
When the Great War broke out it was a sign to mobilize Polish patriotic paramilitary organizations. On 27 August 1914, Józef Piłsudski issued an order in which he declared formation of the Polish Legions. On the strength of the order the Eastern Legion was formed in Lviv under the command of the General Adam Pietraszkiewicz. Haller was one of the founders of this formation which is a combination of Falcon&#x27;s Drużyny Polowe (Fields Brigades), and the Polskie Drużyny Strzeleckie (Polish Rifle Squads). At that time Austrian failures in Galicia led to occupation of Lviv and the whole territory of the eastern Galicia by the Russian army. The Legion had to withdraw into the surroundings of Mszana Dolna. Although the unit had been completely formed it did not participate in the battle. Due to a collapse of morale among soldiers and resistance against swearing loyalty to the Austrian emperor, the legion was disbanded.

===Polish Legions===

Soldiers, who were in favor for continuing the war against the Russian Empire, were subjected to Joseph Haller&#x27;s directions. He became the commander of the 3rd Legions&#x27; Infantry Regiment after its former reorganisation. He was then ranked lieutenant-colonel. On 30 September 1914, Haller and the military unit under his surveillance left Kraków, and set off to the front line in Eastern Carpathians. Despite bad climatic and topographic conditions, the brigade supported the defence of the Carpathians and hindered Russian access to Hungary.

In the beginning of October 1914, the brigade got to Hungarian side of Carpathians. On October 12 the 3rd Legions&#x27; Infantry Regiment troops under the command of Haller surmounted the Rafajlowa village in Galicia. On 22 and 23 October the main troops reached the village through the route near the Pantyr Mountain in Gorgany (later on it was named the Legions’ Mountain Pass), built by sappers and assaulted on Stanisławów. On 24 October the troops defeated Nadvirna. Five days later the Molotkow battle took place. The failure pushed Haller&#x27;s soldiers back to Rafajlowa. In November the brigade was divided into two separate units. Haller&#x27;s brigade remained in Rafajlowa, whereas the others continued the battle in Huculszczyzna and Bukovina.

On the night of 24 January 1915, Russians attacked the 3rd Legions&#x27; Infantry Regiment. Polish soldiers did not expect the offensive. However, due to their commander&#x27;s actions, they defeated the enemy and took many Prisoners of War (POWs). A permanent struggle resulted in the loss of approximately 50% of soldiers. After the successful defence and stabilization on the front line, lieutenant colonel Haller passed the leadership of the 3rd Legions&#x27; Infantry Regiment to major Henryk Minkiewicz, simultaneously remaining in the 2nd Legions’ Infantry Brigade as commander&#x27;s orderly officer. On 14 March 1915 he was promoted colonel.

On a temporary permit in Częstochowa, in May 1915 Haller was injured in a car accident. He spent 10 months recovering in a hospital. In spring of 1916 Haller became a member of the Colonels’ Council, which incorporated the heads of Legions’ military units, and functioned in opposition to Legions’ Headquarters, which advocated Austrian policy. In July 1918 Haller was given an assignment to command the 2nd Legions’ Infantry Brigade, which he accepted.

===Polish Rifle Division===
On 15 February 1918, Haller questioned the agreements of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk which reduced the chances for the creation of an independent Poland. Together with the II Brigade of the Polish Legions and the rest of Polish soldiers, Haller broke through the frontline near Rarańcza. and joined the Polish troops in Russia. He was ranked commander of a newly formed Polish 5th Siberian Rifle Division.

From 28 March 1918, he took charge of the military units of the Polish 2nd Corps in Ukraine. On 7 April 1918 Haller was appointed General. The legions under Haller&#x27;s command were inspired by the National Democracy movement. Recruitment of Jewish volunteers to their ranks ceased in 1918, and the legions were later involved in pogroms.

===Kaniów===

Germany considered the presence of Polish military units in Ukraine an infringement of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. At midnight on 10–11 May 1918 German troops assaulted Polish units near Kaniv (Polish: Kaniów). There were no warnings preceding the attack. The battle continued for one day. After the ammunition storage expired, the Polish 2nd Corps surrendered. Many people were seriously injured. The Polish army lost less than 1000. the Germans close to 1500. Haller avoided imprisonment by faking his own death. Using the name &quot;Mazowiecki&quot; he fled to Moscow, where he became the head of Polish Army Commission.

===France===
In July 1918, after a long journey through East Karelia and Kola Peninsula to Murmansk, General Haller arrived in France. On 4 October 1918 he was designated to be in charge of the forming Polish Army. Those units were organised by volunteers. They consisted of Polish men who firstly served in the French army, former POWs of Austrian-Hungarian and German armies (nearly 35,000) and Polish emigrants from the United States and Canada (about 23,000 people) and Brazil (300 people). Political surveillance over the army was initially a domain of Polish National Committee. But according to an agreement of 28 September 1918, the Blue Army was recognised by the Triple Entente member countries and the independent Polish army.

In 1918 Polish troops commanded by Joseph Haller struggled with German soldiers on the western front line in the Vosges mountain region and Champagne.

===Blue Army===
The end of war did not interrupt the enlargement of the Polish army in France, also known as the Blue Army due to their uniforms. The number of soldiers was eventually over 100,000. Due to weapons supplied from France, the Polish Army finally became a significant military force. Beginning in April 1919, men and equipment were conveyed to Poland. Modern arms of the Blue Army, especially airplanes and Renault FT tanks enhanced the Polish Armed Forces yet to be founded. General Haller arrived in Warsaw on 21 April 1919, where he was welcomed as a national hero. He was granted honorary citizenship of Warsaw. The Blue Army was involved in anti-Jewish violence and its soldiers participated in pogroms.

==World War I aftermath==
===Polish-Ukrainian War===
Because the Blue Army was the only well-armed combat unit in the recreated Polish Army, the command decided not to split it into smaller pieces. The whole army was deployed at the Polish-Ukrainian frontline. In the course of victorious battles against the Ukrainian army, Haller&#x27;s forces reached the Zbruch River, passing Volhynia and Eastern Galicia. However, in June the General himself was dispatched to the Polish-German borderline in order to take command of the army on the South-Western front.

===Pomerania===

In October 1919, Haller was entrusted with the command of the Pomeranian Front, created in order to claim the territory of Pomerania, in peaceful and planned way, as the territory was granted to Poland according to the Treaty of Versailles. As planned, the taking over of Pomerania began on 18 January 1920, starting with Toruń, which was taken over by squadrons of the 16th Pomeranian Infantry Division. More territories were taken from the retreating German Army, until 11 February 1920, when the last of the soldiers left Gdańsk (Danzig).

Despite a few incidents, including armed resistance and sabotage, the Pomeranian takeover proceeded rather easily. On 10 February 1920, General Haller together with the Minister of Internal Affairs, Stanisław Wojciechowski, and the new administration of the Pomeranian Province came to Puck, where he performed a &quot;symbolic wedding ceremony&quot; of Poland and the Baltic Sea.

=== Polish-Soviet War ===

In 1920 Haller was appointed Inspector General of the Volunteer Army, the formation to which he made a great contribution. During the Battle of Warsaw, he led the forces defending the capital&#x27;s foregrounds. He was also a member of the Council for Defence of the Nation (July–August 1920) and later led the North-Eastern Front. At this stage of his career, he saw the end of the war.

== The interwar period ==

After the war, Józef Haller had inter alia function of the Inspector General of Artillery (in the years 1920–26), and the president of the Supreme Military Evaluation Commission. He was also a member of the War Council, lead the Hallerczyks’ Union, and from 3 July 1920 until 4 February 1923, was President of the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association. During the years 1922–27 he was a member of the Sejm, of the Christian Union of National Unity Party. Because of his nationalist views, he was considered, among others, one of those who were responsible for the anti-Semitic riots in Częstochowa in 1919 in which soldiers of the Blue Army took part. He was also said to be responsible for inspiring an atmosphere of hostility towards president Gabriel Narutowicz, claiming that he had been elected with &quot;non-Polish&quot; votes; Narutowicz would be assassinated days after his election.

In 1923 and again in 1933, the General traveled to the United States with a mission of support for veterans and disabled members of the Blue Army. Among the sites General Haller visited in 1923 was St. Hyacinth Basilica in Chicago&#x27;s Polish Village, taking part in the dedication service of a monument dedicated to the Blue Army that still stands in the &quot;Garden of Memory&quot; next to the Basilica to the present day.

General Haller condemned Piłsudski&#x27;s May Coup d&#x27;État which resulted in him being retired on 31 January 1926. In the 1920s along with his wife Alexandra and his son Eryk he settled in Pomerania in the Gorzuchowo mansion, near Chełmno. During the years 1936–39, he was one of the organizers and leaders of Front Morges which was in opposition to the government of the sanacja regime. On 10 October 1937, on the Labor Party&#x27;s Constitutional Congress he was elected the head of the party&#x27;s Principal Board.

== World War II ==


After World War II broke out, Haller managed to make his way through Romania, to France, where he offered himself to serve General Władysław Sikorski&#x27;s government, which was about to be formed. He also led the Intergovernmental Committee for Registration. On the first days of November 1939 he entered the government as a Minister without Portfolio. At the turn of the years 1939–1940, he travelled again to the US, but this time to encourage American Polonia to join the Polish Army, which was being formed in France.

After the fall of the government in France, Haller reached Great Britain, through Spain and Portugal. In Great Britain during the years 1940–1943, he was a Minister of Education in the Polish Government-in-Exile.

== Postwar ==
After the war Józef Haller decided to remain abroad and settled in London for good, where, steeped in the legend of the &quot;Blue General&quot;, he died on 4 June 1960 at the age of 86. He was buried in the Gunnersbury cemetery. Thanks to the initiative of the Polish Scouts from &quot;Whites&quot; team, his ashes were returned to Poland on 23 April 1993 and are now kept in a crypt in St. Agnes’ garrison church in Kraków.

<text>Plestiodon inexpectatus, the southeastern five-lined skink is a common skink in the southeastern United States.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;inexpectatus&quot; (&quot;the unexpected&quot;), is possibly a reference to the unexpected discovery of this species in 1932, almost 175 years after Linnaeus described &quot;Plestiodon fasciatus&quot;, commonly known as the American five-lined skink.

==Description==
As their common name suggests, southeastern five-lined skinks have five characteristic narrow stripes along their bodies that become lighter with age. The middle stripe tends to be narrower than the others, and the dark areas between stripes are black in young skinks but become brown with age. A similar lizard, the common five-lined skink (&quot;Plestiodon fasciatus&quot;), is slightly smaller than the southeastern five-lined skink and has broader stripes. However, it is difficult to discriminate between these two species on the basis of physical appearance.

Young southeastern five-lined skinks have a bright blue or purplish tail, especially towards the tip. Also, stripes become a bright reddish orange towards the head. Juvenile coloration may persist into adulthood, giving the head of the animal an altogether orange-brown appearance.

==Habitat==
Southeastern five-lined skinks are common inhabitants of wooded areas of the southeastern United States. They are commonly found on small islands off the southeastern coast even in the absence of fresh water and vegetation.

==Behavior==
They are diurnal ground-dwelling animals.

==Diet==
Like other skinks of the genus &quot;Plestiodon&quot;, they feed primarily on insects, preferring larger prey such as grasshoppers.

==In captivity==
This skink species is easy to maintain in captivity. It has the same requirements as the common five-lined skink, although it can tolerate dryer conditions.

==Reproduction==
Southeastern five-lined skinks are oviparous; the clutch size varies from 6 to 12, with the number of eggs diminishing with higher latitudes. The female broods the eggs and protects them from predators, including other skinks. The hatchlings appear about one month after the eggs have been laid near the beginning of summer.

<text>The City of London School, also known as CLS and City, is a private day school for boys in the City of London, England, on the banks of the River Thames next to the Millennium Bridge, opposite Tate Modern. It is a partner school of the City of London School for Girls and the City of London Freemen&#x27;s School. All three schools receive funding from the City&#x27;s Cash. It is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference (HMC). It is one of the most academically selective and successful schools in the country.

The school was founded by a private act of Parliament, the Establishment of Honey Lane Market School Act 1834 (4 &amp; 5 Will. 4. c. &quot;35&quot; ), following a bequest of land in 1442 for poor children in the City of London. The original school was established at Milk Street, moving first to the Victoria Embankment in 1879 and subsequently to its present site on Queen Victoria Street in 1986.

Former pupils, known as Old Citizens, who have attained eminence in various fields are former UK Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, First World War hero Theodore Bayley Hardy, Nobel Prize–winning scientists Frederick Gowland Hopkins and Peter Higgs, Justice of the Supreme Court Lawrence Collins, Historian John Robert Seeley, England cricket captain Mike Brearley, chemist and entrepreneur William Henry Perkin, Booker Prize-winning authors Kingsley Amis and Julian Barnes, film director Michael Apted, and actor Daniel Radcliffe.

The school provides day education to about 1,000 boys aged 11 to 18 and employs approximately 100 teaching staff and around another 100 non-teaching staff. The majority of pupils enter at 11, some at 13 and some at 16 into the Sixth Form. Admissions are based on an entrance examination and an interview, with the exception of pupils educated at the City Junior School, who are given an automatic place at 11+.

==History==

The City of London School traces its origins to a bequest of land by John Carpenter, town clerk of London. On his death in 1442, it was found that Carpenter had listed many bequests, most to his relatives but some to charitable causes. There were no bequests listed to directly support the education of boys in the City of London. However, a bequest of land was left to two trusted friends who were aware that Carpenter desired a legacy which would support children, and in turn the land was passed on to John Don, an influential man in the City of London. On his death, Don left his own will incorporating the words used in Carpenter&#x27;s bequest of land and his intentions for the land, that it be &quot;for the finding and bringing up of four poor men&#x27;s children with meat, drink, apparel, learning at the schools, in the universities, etc., until they be preferred, and then others in their places for ever.&quot; The four boys became known as Carpenter&#x27;s Children.

Little is known of the early years of the legacy. This bequest was administered by the Corporation of London in around 1460 and a small college was founded next to Guildhall Chapel, also using the library facilities in the chapel. Despite the fact that this continued for over 70 years, the earliest certain evidence of the existence of Carpenter&#x27;s Children can only be traced back to 1536, and thus it is not clear who these boys were, what they were taught and where they lived. In 1547, under the Chantries Act the Guildhall Chapel and Library were forfeited. The funding for the four boys was also discontinued. The Corporation of London remained in control of Carpenter&#x27;s estate and accounts from the next 300 years show that the money continued to be spent on children&#x27;s benefits such as providing new coats to every child or providing them with access to education.

In 1823, a report published by the Charity Commission revealed that over the centuries, the income from the bequest vastly exceeded the expenses of the boys&#x27; education. In response to the report, the Corporation of London indicated that it had taken, &quot;great pains...by searching in the archives of the corporation and other places for the will of John Carpenter, without effect&quot;. Had the Corporation instead looked for the will of John Don, it would have received guidance in what to do with the money.

Lacking that guidance, discussions began on how the bequest money should be spent. The City Lands Committee suggested in a report that the bequest should be spent on educating a larger number of boys and this approach was adopted in 1826. A number of people including Richard Taylor, a printer and an assistant to the founding of University College London, urged the Corporation of London to spend the bequest on creating a day school for the largest possible number of boys. In 1830, they proposed that the City of London Corporation School should be founded with Taylor as a governor and that the school to be established on the site of the disused London Workhouse. In the meantime, a small number of boys, who became known as Carpenter&#x27;s scholars, were sent to Tonbridge School. An act of Parliament, the Estate of the London Workhouse Act 1829 (10 Geo. 4. c. &quot;43&quot;), was passed to transform the workhouse into a school and governors were appointed. Conditions at the workhouse site had deteriorated and much money was needed for its maintenance. The only funds available, though, were the same £300 (about £30,000 in 2016) a year budget the workhouse had received.
Over the next few years, the workhouse proposal was seen by the City of London Lord Mayor&#x27;s and the City Lands Committee (Taylor was a member of both), as impractical, and other schemes were proposed. In 1832, Warren Stormes Hale, who believed that the workhouse proposal was not the best use of Carpenter&#x27;s legacy, was appointed to the City Lands Committee. He became chairman of the committee in 1833, and would come to be considered the second founder of the City of London School, after Carpenter.

At this point, the City Lands Committee started to search for better locations for a school. They selected Honey Lane Market, a site on Milk Street, as their preferred location. However, this proposal faced the same funding difficulties as the workhouse proposal: only £300 per year was available, insufficient to build and maintain a school. This problem was not recognised until the bill to found the school reached the House of Lords. An altered bill was finalised in 1834, removing any references to the London Workhouse and addressing the Lords&#x27; objections.
The altered bill was passed as an act of Parliament, the (4 &amp; 5 Will. 4. c. &quot;35&quot; ). It was this act which founded the City of London School, which initially had around 400 pupils. The act gave the Corporation of London a duty to maintain a school on the Honey Lane Market site and so gave control over almost every aspect of the school&#x27;s running to the corporation. A committee was also set up to manage the school, with Hale as chairman. Although the committee&#x27;s powers were initially limited, they gained more control over time as they made important decisions for the school.

The act gave the new school an annual budget of £900 (around £107,000 in 2016) from the bequest while the governors of the City of London Corporation School, who still wanted to implement their original idea, gained nothing, only retaining the old workhouse income. Both Hale and the Corporation of London were also eager to create this second school, which the governors of the City of London Corporation School had proposed. Despite their efforts, the other school was not founded until 1854, as the Freemen&#x27;s Orphanage School, in Brixton with Hale as chairman. The Freemen&#x27;s Orphanage School still exists today as the City of London Freemen&#x27;s School in Surrey.

=== Establishment at Milk Street ===

The foundation stone of the new school was laid by Lord Brougham at premises in Milk Street, in the City of London near Cheapside, on part of the site of the old Honey Lane Market, in 1835 and the school opened its doors in 1837.

The school was remarkable for its time in several respects. It did not discriminate against pupils on the grounds of religious persuasion (at a time when most public schools had an Anglican emphasis); it included pupils from non-conformist and Jewish families. Also, unlike other established independent schools, it was a day school (although there were in early days a handful of boarders, no boarding department ever became established). It also promoted a practical and progressive scheme of education which was well ahead of its time. It was the first school in England to include science on the curriculum and to include scientific experiments as part of its teaching. It also offered education in commercial subjects. This did not, however, diminish its teaching in the subjects traditionally favoured by the traditional public schools, and it sent classical and mathematical scholars to Oxford and Cambridge throughout the 19th century. These included the classicist, theologian and Shakespearean scholar Edwin Abbott Abbott (whose mathematical exploration of a world in other than three dimensions, &quot;Flatland&quot;, is still in print and who returned to the school as headmaster), John Robert Seeley – a classics scholar who became Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University and H. H. Asquith, who though educated as a classical scholar went on to become the British Prime Minister.

=== Move to Blackfriars ===
The school eventually outgrew its original site. While some public schools moved away from Greater London in the late 19th century, the management and committee of City of London jointly decided to stay in the capital, as it was deemed a stimulating environment for education. A City of London School Act 1879 (c.63) empowered the school to move to a new site in the City of London at Blackfriars on the Victoria Embankment overlooking the Thames. The school moved in 1883 and the new building was opened by the Prince of Wales, (the future King Edward VII). In 1887 the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal determined that the City of London School was a public school.

In November 1912, the Education Committee appointed Cyril Burt as a psychologist in the education officer&#x27;s department. In Britain, this was the first appointment in a field of psychology outside a university. From 1913 to 1931 Burt examined pupils nominated for admission to special schools. His mandate included selection and research.

In 1920, an arrangement was made whereby all the boy choristers of the Temple Church were given scholarships at the City of London School. In 1926, this arrangement was extended to the boy choristers of the Chapel Royal at St. James&#x27;s Palace. The choristers included Ernest Lough, whose recording of Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;O for the Wings of a Dove&quot; with the Temple Choir in 1927 made him world-famous; by 1962 it became the first classical record to sell more than a million copies. Another musician educated at the school was the cellist Steven Isserlis.

===Second World War===

In 1938, the headmaster F.R. Dale made an agreement with George Turner, headmaster of Marlborough College, to evacuate the school there, if it became necessary. On 1 September 1939 following the German invasion of Poland and the start of the Second World War, the majority of the school were sent to Marlborough College by train.

Accommodation was not provided in the agreement with Marlborough College and so Turner wrote to the Mayor of Marlborough to request accommodation in town. Many of the accommodation billets were occupied by soldiers and women working for the Ministry of Health at the time and so for the first night, the boys slept in the gymnasium of the school, before moving into the town&#x27;s billets the following night.

When the Marlborough term began, an arrangement was made whereby City of London boys had lessons during games for Marlborough College pupils and vice versa. The difficulties at the Marlborough location ranged from finding a study for Headmaster Dale to finding enough kitchen staff to prepare food for both schools. Resources were limited and outbreaks of influenza and rubella were common. Like many other schools evacuated into the countryside, the City of London School&#x27;s enrolment fell from 700 to 430 during the war, although no pupil was killed or injured as a direct result of enemy fire.

The arrangements at Marlborough College gave pupils the opportunity to strengthen the school&#x27;s clubs and societies. This included a dramatic society, in which Kingsley Amis played a large part.

Marlborough College itself experienced some threat from the war. The Ministry of Aircraft Production had also relocated there, and in 1942, bombs fell nearby. By 1944, with the war settling down, the City of London School returned to its home on the Victoria Embankment, which had suffered no structural damage during the Blitz. Air raid shelters were built on site as a precautionary measure.

Soon after the building reopened, a bomb fell on the nearby Law Courts, and the staff sent pupils home for a week. However, some pupils were due to take public exams. After Marlborough College refused them permission to take the exams there, it was decided that boys would take the Higher Certificate papers in the Guildhall Crypt.

It took the school over five years to fully recover from the effects of the war. Many Old Citizens had lost their lives fighting in the war. Today, there is a memorial in the school&#x27;s courtyard (transplanted from the main staircase of the old Blackfriars site) to remember those Old Citizens who had lost their lives in both World Wars. An annual remembrance service, involving members of the Combined Cadet Force, is held on the Friday closest to Armistice Day in November.

=== Modernisation and move to Queen Victoria Street ===
The school underwent many changes during its time on the Victoria Embankment. The curriculum had been consolidated at the turn of the century, the Combined Cadet Force was modernised, the house system had been reorganised, the &quot;mission&quot;, what is now the annual charity appeal, had been started and a Community Service Organisation had been set up as an alternative to the Combined Cadet Force. It was compulsory for a boy, above the third form, to serve in one of these organisations for at least five school terms. This is a tradition which still exists today. In 1925, the school acquired its sports grounds at Grove Park, Lewisham. This site included a pavilion, containing offices, changing rooms, toilets and showers, which was designed, by Old Citizen Ralph Knott, to also be a memorial to those Old Citizens who had lost their lives in the First World War. When J. A. Boyes became headmaster in 1964, further modernisations were made in the building. As the number of pupils increased over the years, overcrowding became a problem. Headmaster Boyes, believed that a new, modern building was needed for the school, and his efforts managed to secure a site on the banks of the River Thames for a new facility.

In 1986, the City of London School moved to its present site in purpose-built facilities in Queen Victoria Street (where it is opposite the College of Arms and just below St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral) on one side and facing onto the banks of the River Thames on the other side. School activity transferred to the new premises over the 1986 summer holidays, in time for the 1986–1987 academic year, and a ceremony for the official opening of the building, by the Princess Anne, was held in 1987. The Millennium Bridge is next to the school buildings.

==Buildings==
===Milk Street (1837–1883)===

The original building at Milk Street was designed by architect J.B. Bunning, who was the architect to the City of London. The building was designed in a neo-Gothic Tudor style.

===Victoria Embankment (1883–1986)===

The Victoria Embankment building, a grand building said to be in the Italian Renaissance style but actually in a high Victorian style with a steep pitched roof resembling that of a French chateau, was designed by Davis and Emanuel and constructed by John Mowlem &amp; Co. at a cost exceeding £100,000 (about £11,158,064.52 in 2016). The designers designed the school as &quot;amazingly unscholastic, rather like a permanent Exhibition Palace.&quot;

On the front of the building are statues of Shakespeare, Milton, Bacon, Newton and Sir Thomas More with &quot;the first four emphasising the school&#x27;s literary and scientific traditions [and] the last being a religious martyr, a famous lawyer and the author of Utopia.&quot;

The building remained the home of the City of London School for a hundred years, although the site expanded to include not only the original building on the Victoria Embankment itself, but a range of buildings at right angles along the whole of John Carpenter Street, which was named after the founder of the school, and further buildings constructed at the back along Tudor Street, with the school playground, Fives courts and cloisters enclosed within the site. These other buildings were demolished when the school moved again in 1986. Here the school was adjacent to the City of London School for Girls, which was founded by the City of London Corporation as a sister school in 1894 and moved in 1969 to its present site in the Barbican, and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama which has also since moved to the Barbican. It was also next to the traditional home of the British newspaper industry in Fleet Street.

This building still stands and is protected by a preservation order; it was occupied by the investment bank JPMorgan, and it appeared on the left of the famous Thames Television ident from 1968 to 1989. The building still features the school&#x27;s name above the door. The auxiliary buildings in John Carpenter Street and Tudor Street, however, were demolished shortly after the school vacated the premises.

===Queen Victoria Street (1986–present)===

The present building on Queen Victoria Street was designed by City of London architect Thomas Meddings, an Old Citizen of the school as well as a former Temple Church chorister. It is a wholly modern building, although some of the stained glass and sculptures from the Victoria Embankment building has been relocated to this new building. A design and technology block was added to the building in 1990, though in 2008, the block was transformed into a building mainly used by the ICT and music departments, although some design and technology facilities remain. The building was designed on a structural grid and non-load bearing walls were used so that the internal layout of the building could easily be changed when necessary. The school&#x27;s design is also slightly unusual in that it was built avoiding a road tunnel in the centre of the premises. This meant that the first and second floors of the building could only be built on either side of the road tunnel. The load on the third floor directly above the road tunnel is also limited and so there is a courtyard which goes up to the fifth floor, surrounded by the building, in that area. The current building is opened to the public annually on one weekend in September as part of the Open House London event.

In 2020, an international two-stage competition was announced for a £19 million revamp of the present City of London School building. The competition, which has been organised by New London Architecture on behalf of the City of London Corporation, will select the entry that brings an &#x27;innovative and sustainable&#x27; upgrade to the building complex. The project represents a part of an overall plan to expand capacity at the school. The contract was won by a joint proposal from Morris &amp; Co. and Freehaus.

The front view of the building beside the River Thames with St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in the background and the Millennium Bridge on the right is occasionally seen in popular media such as in the BBC News 60-second countdown as well as in an early scene of the 2005 movie, &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot; and in the 2009 film &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;.

==School life==

===Houses===
City of London School has six Houses: Abbott, Beaufoy, Carpenter, Hale, Mortimer, and Seeley. As well as houses named after the founder of the school John Carpenter and former headmasters Edwin Abbott and George Mortimer, they include houses named after important Old Citizens or school benefactors including Beaufoy, a philanthropist who donated the sum of £10,000 (about £660,000 in 2016) in the 18th century, Hale who played a significant role in the school&#x27;s founding and Seeley, a famous historian who attended the school. Boys are assigned to a House in the Third Form (13 years old), in which they stay throughout their school career. There are inter-house events (e.g. sports, literature, maths) which contribute points to an overall Interhouse Competition that is decided at the end of the year, of which the reigning 2023-24 champions are Mortimer House.

===School uniform===
The school requires school uniform for all pupils up to the fifth form. Sixth formers do not have to wear uniform, but are required to wear suits and the sixth form school tie.

===Curriculum===
In 2019, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; placed the school eighth in its League Tables of Independent School A-level results, with 81.2% of entries gaining A* or A grades at A-level. The Telegraph also placed it 6th for GCSE results, with 94.62% of papers graded 9-7 (A*-A in the old system). As of 2017 around 35 pupils took up places at Oxbridge each year.

Pupils are required to take a minimum of ten GCSE subjects in the fourth and fifth form of which six, mathematics, English Language, English literature, biology, chemistry and physics are chosen for all students. Of the remaining four options, one must be a humanity and another a modern foreign language. Additionally, one GCSE subject may be dropped in favour of the Higher Project Qualification (HPQ) offered in design, computing and robotics lessons, the GCSE level equivalent of the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ). Additional subjects and qualifications are taken by some students. In 2007 the school also started offering IGCSE in some subjects.

In the sixth form, boys take either three or four subjects at A-level, or three subjects and an Extended Project Qualification (EPQ). Subjects on offer include Geography, History and Politics, Economics, Mathematics, Language and Literature, Music, Modern Languages, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Drama and Theatre, Classical Civilization, Latin &amp; Greek, Design and Visual Arts, Religious Education, Information Technology and Physical Education. There is also a programme of PSHE, and games at all levels, and an programme for the first and second forms.

===Extracurricular activities===
The school offers many extracurricular activities. These include over 50 clubs and societies including a Model United Nations, public speaking and debating society which frequently participates in international competitions; the Square Mile Club, which in the past has attracted notable speakers such as Sir Trevor Macdonald, Brian Paddick, Sir David Pepper and Ian Livingston; and even a student-founded Star Wars Society. Boys themselves can create and manage clubs, with school funding available for activities. There are also trips, opportunities to carry out community service and a Combined Cadet Force. The school also gives boys the opportunity to receive instrumental tuition as well as join music groups including orchestras and choirs. The school also offers sports including football, cricket, basketball, water polo, swimming, sailing, fencing, squash, badminton, fives, athletics, cross-country, judo, karate and indoor rowing. Most of these sports take place on school facilities. Sports such as sailing and climbing take place on non-school facilities. Boys also represent the school in competitions at varying levels. The school has a tradition of supporting a charity, chosen by the boys through a ballot, each academic year. The fundraising activities are coordinated by the boys and events take place throughout the year to raise money for the selected charity. An average of £50,000 is raised each year. The school also participates annually in the UKMT Team Maths Challenge and the Hans Woyda Maths Challenge, consistently finishing in the top ranks each year.

===Facilities===

The school&#x27;s sports facilities include a multi-purpose indoor sports hall, a 25-metre swimming pool, a gym, a rooftop AstroTurf football pitch and grass playing fields and athletics tracks at Grove Park, Lewisham. Music facilities include three ensemble rooms, ten rehearsal rooms and a music technology lab. Other facilities include the Great Hall, a sixth form common room, a bookshop, a library, an archive room, three ICT labs, facilities for the Combined Cadet Force (including a rifle range), a drama studio, two playgrounds and a drama theatre. The Great Hall houses a Walker organ which was moved from the previous school building and put into a new casing. The organ has 3 manual departments, 61 notes and a pedal department with 32 notes as well as 43 stops, 4 tremulants and 6 couplers. The drama theatre (Winterflood Theatre) was rebuilt in 2009 at a value of £1.3 million. The project was jointly funded by City entrepreneur Brian Winterflood and the City of London Corporation. The new theatre was designed by architectural firm RHWL and built by Wilmott Dixon Construction.

===Traditional events===
Although the school provides a very modern atmosphere in most aspects of school life, there are some traditional events held annually, although attendance of these events is no longer compulsory for all boys. This includes the annual prize giving ceremony at Guildhall, London and the annual carol service at Temple Church, among others. The school is also home to the annual London Classical Reading Competition, participated in by schools nationwide. Another traditional event is &quot;muck-up day&quot; celebrated by the leaving year group at the end of formal schooling in their final year at the school. In 2015 this attracted police attention when plans to bring in paint for &quot;raucous&quot; celebrations led to concerns about disruption to the city&#x27;s financial district. The headmistress did not hesitate to bar the year group from school grounds &quot;for their own safety&quot;, and told them that any such behaviour would result in their UCAS forms being &#x27;ripped up&#x27;.

===Governance===
Today, the City of London School&#x27;s policies are maintained by a board of governors. It continues to be under the governance of the City of London Corporation (the governing body of the City of London headed by the Lord Mayor of the City of London, as opposed to Greater London, as well as an independent corporation). The school is under the governance of the City of London Corporation&#x27;s corporate arm as opposed to its Local Authority arm.

The school is one of the three independent secondary schools owned by the City of London Corporation, the other two being the City of London School for Girls and the City of London Freemen&#x27;s School. The City of London School for Girls located in the Barbican is a fifteen-minute walk away from the school and there are joint events, such as social evenings, concerts and plays, with the school throughout the year.

==School fees==
Although the City of London School has always charged fees to most of its pupils, it describes the fees as moderate compared with other independent schools, and it has always offered scholarships, both on the basis of academic and musical ability (it educates ten boys selected for the Choir of Her Majesty&#x27;s Chapel Royal). In 2008, the school began offering sports scholarships. After the withdrawal of the Government Assisted Places scheme in 1998, the school has offered full-fee bursaries (or Sponsored Awards) to pupils from families on lower incomes with the help of contributions from parties including private companies, the John Carpenter Club, the City of London Corporation, and parents of current pupils. In 2014, at a time when 82 boys at the school received bursaries of 100% of the annual fees of £14,313, the previous head Sarah Fletcher said that her decision to take up the position had been influenced by the school&#x27;s generous bursary schemes, partly because her own grandfather had enjoyed a life-changing opportunity when given an educational bursary many years before.

For the 2022–23 academic year, the annual school fees were £19,995, and lunch was an extra £292 a term (£876 a year). Music lessons were an additional £271 a term (£813 a year).

==Charitable status==
The school runs an annual Charity Appeal each year. The proceeds raised across the academic year go towards a dedicated charity of choosing, voted upon by pupils of the school, making sure that the school&#x27;s charity efforts reflect topical issues. Each year&#x27;s Charity Appeal is managed by a student committee, who plans school events, fund-raisers, partnerships, and sponsors. Events in the past have included the 24-hour &#x27;fishathon&#x27;, 48-hour row, cake sales, sponsored swims and an 11-mile sponsored walk.

The chosen charity as of 2023-24 is World Child Cancer, a charity set up to fight cancer in kids globally. Past charities have included WaterAid, GOSH, Teenage Cancer Trust, Providence Row, and Papyrus.

The school also has six charities registered with the Charity Commission. These are &quot;The City of London School Bursary Fund&quot; which contributes to the funding of the bursary schemes, &quot;The City of London School Bursary Trust&quot; which provides bursaries to boys who have gained admission to the school but whose parents cannot afford the fees, &quot;The City of London School Scholarships and Prize Fund&quot; which allows the school and other parties to offer scholarships, prizes or sponsored awards to current or former pupils without incurring taxes, &quot;The City of London School War Memorial Fund&quot; which was originally established to support boys affected by the World Wars but now supports means-tested bursaries at the School, &quot;The City of London School Charitable Trust&quot; which is the annual charity appeal and &quot;The City of London School Education Trust&quot; which exempts the school from taxes as an independent school providing education for pupils within the school, as well as providing educational and recreational facilities for children and young people in the surrounding communities.

==Notable people==

Many distinguished people have been part of the school either as pupils (see List of Old Citizens) or staff.

Notable recent pupils include the actors Daniel Radcliffe from Harry Potter movies, Skandar Keynes, of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; film series, Joe Alwyn of &quot;The Favourite&quot; and Harry Michell of &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; and &quot;Feather Boy&quot;.

Jack Crawford is a British born American football player who was drafted with the 158th overall pick in the 2012 NFL draft by the Oakland Raiders.

MJ Cole is an English DJ, record producer, musician and remixer. He is known as a pioneer of UK Garage Music, having been engineer and lead producer of tracks on the UK Garage label V.I.P. (Very Important Plastic) between 1997 and 1999 and a pirate radio DJ on London Underground FM, alongside the likes of the Dreem Teem.

Jonathan Keates, a prize-winning writer, was an English master at the school. Sheila Gallagher was honoured for her service as a lollipop lady at the crossing to the school on Queen Victoria Street, in 2002.

Horace Brearley, father of cricketer Mike Brearley, was also a master at the school.

Old boys of the City of London School are known as &quot;Old Citizens&quot;. they may join the &quot;John Carpenter Club&quot;. Over 140 people listed in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; were educated at the City of London School, and that includes only those who were already deceased at the time of writing.

==Headmasters==
The school has had thirteen headmasters. The first was John Allen Giles, a scholar of Anglo-Saxon history and a Fellow at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, who also wrote a number of scholarly works, including the 34 volume &quot;Patres ecclesiæ Anglicanæ&quot;. Giles was however, &quot;temperamentally unsuited&quot; to be headmaster of the school, and was replaced by George Ferris Whidborne Mortimer, a liberal who had written an anti-slavery pamphlet. Mortimer&#x27;s religious tolerance led him to open the school to boys from Jewish families. He was replaced in 1865 by a former boy, Edwin Abbott Abbott, author of &quot;Flatland&quot;. Abbott oversaw the education of future prime minister H. H. Asquith, before retiring in 1889 to devote himself to literary and theological pursuits.

Arthur Chilton was appointed headmaster in 1905, an appointment he held for 24 years and throughout World War One, until 1929. In 1950 Arthur W. Barton, a scholar and football referee, took over as headmaster until 1965. Martin Hammond was head from 1984 to 1990. David R. Levin, who was also the chair of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference for the 2009–2010 academic year, held the position from 1999 to 2014. He left the school in January 2014 to become the managing director of all the independent schools owned by United Learning. In May 2014 he was succeeded by Sarah Fletcher, who had been the head of Kingston Grammar School. Gary Griffin had been acting as head in the interim. She left to join St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School. In January 2018, Alan Bird replaced Sarah Fletcher as head.

<doc id="528572" wikidata="Q2794382" url="?curid=528572" title="Herne Hill railway station">
<text>Herne Hill railway station is in the London Borough of Lambeth, South London, England, on the boundary between London fare zones 2 and 3. Train services are provided by Thameslink to London Blackfriars, Farringdon, St Pancras International and St Albans on the Thameslink route and by Southeastern to London Victoria (via Brixton) and Orpington on the Chatham Main Line. It is down the line from Victoria.

The station building on Railton Road was opened in 1862 by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. Initial service was only to Victoria, but by 1869 services ran to the City of London, King&#x27;s Cross, Kingston via Wimbledon, and Kent, including express trains to Dover Harbour for continental Europe. The arrival of the railways transformed Herne Hill from a wealthy suburb with large residential estates into a densely populated urban area.

== Description ==
Herne Hill railway station sits at the bottom of the hill that gives the area its name and is close to Brockwell Park. The section of Railton Road outside the station is mixed usage for pedestrians and vehicles.

The Chatham Main Line and Sutton Loop railway lines through Herne Hill are elevated above road level on a brick viaduct that runs north–south. The station&#x27;s 1862 Gothic, polychrome brick building is on the western side of the viaduct, with access to the station also from the east via a foot tunnel from Milkwood Road. The building houses a ticket office and newsagent, and was Grade II listed in 1998: the listing notes the station&#x27;s arched doorways, Welsh slate roof and decorative brickwork. It was described by Cherry and Pevsner as a &quot;handsome group&quot; and featured on the cover of a book about London&#x27;s railway architecture. The station entrance canopy (which had been shortened and altered in the mid-20th century) was removed in 2015, owing to its state of disrepair; a new one was installed in July 2016, with a new timber valance design and cornice based on the original Victorian one.

The four tracks are served by two island platforms; northbound trains call at the western platform and southbound trains the eastern platform, providing cross-platform interchange between the two routes.

There are flat junctions at each end of the station: Herne Hill North Junction, where the lines to Loughborough Junction and Brixton diverge; and Herne Hill South Junction, where the lines to West Dulwich and Tulse Hill diverge. Thameslink and Southeastern services cross each other&#x27;s paths at the junctions, constraining capacity on both routes. The station also has a turnback siding on its eastern side, adjacent to Milkwood Road.

== History ==
The area now known as Herne Hill had been a rural part of the Manor of Milkwell since the 13th century. Two tributaries of the River Effra met at the undeveloped site of the future station; it was known as Island Green until the 18th century.

In 1783 a timber merchant, Samuel Sanders, bought Herne Hill from the Manor. Sanders granted leases for large plots of land to wealthy families – John Ruskin spent his childhood at an estate on Herne Hill. The Effra was covered over in the 1820s; and the area had become an upper-class suburb by the mid-19th century (a contemporary author referred to the hill as &quot;the Elysium&quot; for merchants). The opening of the railway station, which provided convenient and cheap access to central London, started the urbanisation of Herne Hill. All of the large estates were eventually cleared to make way for many smaller houses. An 1870 railway travel guide noted the population of Herne Hill was 701; the contemporaneous development of new residential streets would increase the population by 3,000.

=== Construction ===

A railway line through Herne Hill was proposed in 1852 by the Mid Kent and London and South Western Junction Railways Company. No construction work was undertaken at that time and the company had ceased to exist by 1860.

In the late 1850s, the East Kent Railway had ambitions to run passenger trains between Kent and London, but it did not own any railway lines in inner London. It reached an agreement with the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) in 1858 to use its West End and Crystal Palace line to access Battersea and (from 1860) Victoria. This arrangement incurred costly access fees, but it was necessary until the company obtained Parliamentary authority to build in London.

On 6 August 1860, the Metropolitan Extensions Act granted the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR; the successor to the East Kent company) the powers to build three inner London lines: Beckenham Junction to Herne Hill (); Herne Hill to Farringdon (); and Herne Hill to Battersea to connect with the lines into Victoria (). The route from Beckenham Junction to Battersea closely resembled that of the 1852 proposal, going via Clapham, Brixton, Herne Hill, Dulwich and Sydenham.
Herne Hill station and the first section to be completed, from Victoria to Herne Hill via Stewarts Lane and , opened on 25 August 1862. The station was designed by architect John Taylor and railway engineers Joseph Cubitt and J.T. Turner. The building was intended to impress: it had tea rooms offering buffets, decorative brickwork and a tower (which also served the practical function of concealing the water tank for steam locomotives). &quot;The Building News&quot; described the station in 1863 as &quot;spacious and convenient ... and of the very best quality&quot;. It also stated that &quot;an unusual amount of decorative taste has been displayed&quot; in the station&#x27;s construction; even the viaduct was praised as &quot;one of the most ornamental pieces of work we have ever seen attempted on a railway&quot; for its fine brickwork. The station&#x27;s design prompted the journal to write a 2,000-word editorial bemoaning the comparatively poor architectural quality of other contemporary civil engineering projects. An architectural critic later noted the station was &quot;eulogised&quot; by journals upon its opening and that its architecture was still seen as exemplary at the end of the 19th century.

There were initially two platforms, up and down. The up platform was accessed from the upper floor of the station building via a stairway outside the building. The station&#x27;s original signal box, elevated above the railway viaduct at the junction between Norwood Road and Half Moon Lane, was a prominent feature in Herne Hill for many years.

The land for the station was compulsorily purchased from the estate of Thomas Vyse (died 1861), manufacturer of straw hats and owner of the Abbey, an estate at 70 Herne Hill; the station and much of the viaduct were built on part of the Abbey&#x27;s grounds. A new road (Station Road) was built from the junction of Norwood Road and Half Moon Lane, Herne Hill&#x27;s main thoroughfare, to the station.

The line from Beckenham Junction reached Herne Hill from the south in July 1863, connecting the station to the LCDR&#x27;s lines in Kent, and finally allowing the LCDR to avoid using the LB&amp;SCR&#x27;s tracks to access Victoria from Kent. On 6 October 1863, the City Branch opened from Herne Hill as far as , via and .
In 1868, the LB&amp;SCR opened a suburban line from London Bridge to Sutton via . A connecting line from Tulse Hill to Herne Hill opened on 1 January 1869.

=== Early services ===
From July 1863, LCDR trains between Victoria and Kent ran through Herne Hill, and to continental Europe via a connecting steamboat from Dover Harbour to Calais; these boat trains left Victoria and Ludgate Hill simultaneously and were joined at Herne Hill. Express journeys from Herne Hill to Dover, a distance of , took 1 hour 36 minutes, at an average speed of . Services to London were split at Herne Hill to give passengers easier access to the City of London and beyond; the LCDR began operating direct services to King&#x27;s Cross and Barnet (now High Barnet Underground station) from Herne Hill when Snow Hill tunnel opened.

A popular workmen&#x27;s train (one penny per journey) ran between Ludgate Hill and Victoria via Herne Hill from 1865. Trains left from both termini at 04:55 and returned at 18:15. The LCDR was compelled to operate this service by Parliament to compensate for the large number of working-class homes destroyed in Camberwell during the construction of the City Branch. Regular one-way fares to Ludgate Hill were eightpence, sixpence and fourpence for first, second and third class respectively (or return for one shilling, ninepence and sevenpence respectively), with journey times of 15 minutes on express trains and 26 minutes when calling at all stops.

Both the Great Northern Railway (GNR) and the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) helped fund the Metropolitan Extensions (£320,000 and £310,000 respectively; £ and £ in ) in return for the right to use the LCDR&#x27;s tracks. The GNR ran trains between Hatfield and Herne Hill from August 1866 until March 1868 (when the trains were diverted to Victoria via Loughborough Junction); this was a busy all-stops service, with 15 trains leaving Hatfield and 14 leaving Herne Hill every day. The LSWR began running trains between Ludgate Hill and Wimbledon via Herne Hill when the Tulse Hill extension was completed. Some of these services went as far as Kingston until the mid-1890s.

=== Changes from 1870 to 1923 ===

By 1870 a track had been added to the east of the station and two sidings had been added to the west; one of the western sidings was a bay platform for passenger trains, which was accessed from the platform adjoining the upper floor. Interlocking signalling was in use at Herne Hill by 1880.

The LCDR enlarged the station in 1884 to meet growing demand: the viaduct was widened to allow for the construction of a second island platform and two lines to the east (the easternmost line was used only for freight); and the foot tunnel under the viaduct was opened. In 1885, the LCDR decided to use Blackfriars Bridge railway station solely as a goods yard but lacked the space to sort wagons at the site. It purchased of land between Herne Hill and Loughborough Junction for this purpose. The Herne Hill Sorting Sidings had some 35 sidings, the longest of which was . A stationmaster&#x27;s house was built at 239 Railton Road in the mid-1880s as the site offered a good view of the station (it is now privately owned). In 1888, Railton Road was extended to the Norwood Road/Half Moon Lane junction and Station Road ceased to exist.

At the beginning of 1899, the LCDR and the neighbouring South Eastern Railway (SER) combined their operations as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR), jointly owned by the two railways. The SECR ran the trains, but the lines and stations continued to be owned by the LCDR or SER.

A late-night service from Ludgate Hill (departing 01:15) to Beckenham Junction via Herne Hill began in 1910. The intention was to satisfy journalists on Fleet Street who regularly complained in print about the poor quality of service on the line; those working on the morning papers often worked beyond midnight and missed the last train.

Services to Farringdon from Herne Hill were discontinued in 1916 with the closure of Snow Hill tunnel to passengers, and trains from the south terminated at Holborn Viaduct. The LCDR amalgamated with the LB&amp;SCR, SER and several other railways to form the Southern Railway at the start of 1923.

=== Modernisation ===
Work began on electrifying the former LCDR suburban routes in 1924. Herne Hill station was extensively remodelled as part of these works: the eastern island platform was lengthened; the original island platform was demolished and replaced by one further west, allowing two tracks to be laid between the island platforms; the western sidings were removed; and the upper floor was closed to passengers.

On 12 July 1925, a 660-volt third-rail system came into operation on both routes through Herne Hill, from Victoria to Orpington on the Chatham Main Line and along the entire length of the City Branch. Electric trains ran every 20 minutes on both routes during the day and were kept overnight at the sorting sidings north of the station.

The distinctive signal box overlooking Norwood Road and a similar signal box at the northern end of the station were demolished in 1956 and replaced by a single signal box adjacent to the north junction. The replacement signal box was in use from June 1956 until December 1981, when its functions were transferred to Victoria; the building still exists and is used by railway staff. The signalling at Herne Hill was upgraded from semaphores to colour lights on 8 March 1959 as part of the Kent Coast electrification plan.

By 1959, the pattern of commuter services at Herne Hill had taken the shape it held into the 21st century: all-stops trains from Victoria to Orpington and from the City of London to Wimbledon and Sutton (but, unlike the modern Sutton Loop, via West Croydon). However, there was a decline in the number of electric trains on the Chatham Main Line through Herne Hill in the years after the war. Immediately after electrification in 1925, six trains used the route between Herne Hill and Shortlands in each direction during every off-peak hour. By 1960, it had dropped to two trains in each direction.

The Herne Hill Sorting Sidings closed on 1 August 1966 and the freight line to the east of the station was taken out of service. Nothing of the sidings remains: residential accommodation has been built along Shakespeare Road (on the western sidings) and commercial premises have been built along Milkwood Road (on the eastern sidings).

=== From 1988 ===
In 1988, Snow Hill tunnel re-opened and the former LCDR City Branch formed the basis of the new Thameslink route. Network Rail began a major upgrade of the route in 2009. A key objective of the Thameslink Programme was allowing more trains to travel between central London and Brighton, which was prevented by a bottleneck between London Bridge and Blackfriars on a viaduct through the historic Borough Market. Network Rail initially suggested widening the viaduct and demolishing part of the market, but the public backlash against this plan prompted Network Rail to consider permanently routing all Thameslink trains to/from Brighton via Herne Hill, avoiding London Bridge and the market. This would have required the grade separation of the two lines through Herne Hill, which would have been achieved by constructing a new viaduct immediately to the east of the existing viaduct and using a fly-over to connect the southern end of the new viaduct to the line between Tulse Hill and North Dulwich (taking the tracks over the Chatham Main Line and towards Tulse Hill). This proposal was rejected in 2004 because of its environmental impact on Herne Hill and the larger number of interchanges offered on the London Bridge route; the Borough Market viaduct was widened instead.

From 1994 until the completion of High Speed 1 in November 2007 Eurostar services linking London Waterloo to Brussels and Paris passed through Herne Hill without stopping. This marked the end of rail services to the continent via Herne Hill, which had been started by the LCDR in 1863 when the line between Victoria and Dover via Herne Hill was completed.

The upper floor of the station, which had not been used by passengers since 1925, was converted into of office space in 1991 and rented as &#x27;Tower House&#x27; (after the station&#x27;s distinctive tower). The disused freight line to the east of the station was partly reopened in 2009 as a siding for use by Thameslink trains to compensate for the loss of sidings when the Moorgate Thameslink branch was closed. The line&#x27;s connection to the south junction was severed during these works. The station had become fully accessible by 2010: lifts were installed to provide step-free access to the platforms in 2008 and a unisex disabled-accessible toilet was opened on the southbound platforms in 2010.

=== The Thameslink Programme ===

The route through the station was busier from December 2014 to 2018 as Thameslink trains serving London Bridge were diverted via Herne Hill – an additional four trains per hour in both directions. This was due to the redevelopment of London Bridge that temporarily closed it to Bedford-Brighton trains. The additional trains did not call at Herne Hill; they ran fast between London Blackfriars and East Croydon. It was not possible for the 12-car peak trains to call at Herne Hill as the platforms are too short and it was not viable to use selective door operation as the carriages not on the platforms would foul the junctions.
Network Rail, in its July 2011 London &amp; South East route utilisation strategy, recommended that all services from Herne Hill towards Blackfriars should terminate in the bay platforms at Blackfriars after London Bridge&#x27;s redevelopment was completed in 2018 and the diverted Thameslink trains returned there. Passengers from Herne Hill would then have had to change at Blackfriars to travel further north. In January 2013, the Department for Transport (DfT) announced that trains serving the Sutton Loop Line (also known as the Wimbledon Loop) would continue to travel across London after 2018. The number of trains calling at Herne Hill on the route would remain unchanged, with four trains per hour.

=== Accidents and disruption ===

On 6 November 1947, a steam train approaching from West Dulwich passed a signal at danger in heavy fog and crashed into an electric train crossing the station&#x27;s south junction towards Tulse Hill. One passenger on the electric train was killed and nine others were hospitalised.

A minor accident occurred on 30 June 1957. A light engine travelling towards Tulse Hill was waiting to cross the south junction when it was struck from behind by an express passenger train from Victoria that had passed a signal at danger. The driver of the light engine and two passengers from the express were hospitalised but quickly discharged.

A second fatal collision occurred at the sorting sidings, just north of the station, on 1 April 1960 in fog that reduced visibility to . A steam locomotive was waiting on the southbound track outside Herne Hill for a proceed signal when the signalman cleared an electric passenger train behind the steam locomotive to proceed down the same track. The steam locomotive was struck from behind, killing the electric train&#x27;s driver.

== Future ==

=== Services ===
Network Rail has forecast that by 2031 there will be 900 more passengers attempting to travel on the route between Herne Hill and Blackfriars during the busiest peak hour every weekday than can be accommodated on the trains. It is anticipated that eight-car trains with higher capacity (similar to the Class 378 trains used on inner London metro routes) will eventually be required to address this shortfall.

=== Station infrastructure ===

The route from Victoria to Orpington via Herne Hill is projected to be amongst the most congested and overcrowded in South East London by 2026. Network Rail has considered grade-separating the two lines passing through Herne Hill so that trains would not cross each other&#x27;s paths at the station&#x27;s junctions; this restricts the number of services that can pass through the station. A 2008 route utilisation strategy for South London concluded that this improvement would not be required before 2020 but recommended safeguarding the required land. Grade-separation was supported by Southeastern and First Capital Connect believed it should be given more consideration, but Network Rail has stated that it would be difficult to carry out the work because the station is on a viaduct and surrounded by buildings. The 2011 route utilisation strategy, which examined options for congestion relief at Herne Hill before 2031, did not suggest grade-separation as an option in the 2011–2031 period.

This project would also enable the platforms at Herne Hill to be lengthened to accommodate 12-car trains as the current northern junction, which prevents them from being extended, would be removed. However, longer trains could not be used on the Sutton/Wimbledon Loop without also rebuilding Tulse Hill and Elephant &amp; Castle.

Transport for London has suggested there may be potential for the turnback siding adjacent to Milkwood Road to be converted for passenger use. This would require substantial changes to the station as there is no direct access to the platforms from Milkwood Road and the current subway for accessing the platforms does not extend east of the southbound platform.

=== Incorporation into London Overground ===
The Mayor of London published a long-term vision for the London Overground in February 2012. It recommended that all London suburban rail services should eventually be devolved to TfL and that suburban services currently provided by Southeastern be devolved before 2020 to demonstrate the benefits of this approach. Southeastern&#x27;s suburban services include the route between Victoria and Orpington via Herne Hill. TfL had announced that it would bid in late 2012 to have more involvement in these services after the expiration of Southeastern&#x27;s franchise in early 2014, but the DfT announced in March 2013 that Southeastern&#x27;s franchise was being extended until mid-2018.

=== Victoria line extension ===
TfL has considered extending the Victoria line to Herne Hill to provide faster turnaround at the southern end of the line. The extension is not a priority for TfL as it has a weaker business case than other infrastructure projects.

== Services==

Services at Herne Hill are operated by Southeastern and Thameslink using , and EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to via London Blackfriars
* 4 tph to 
* 4 tph to via 
* 4 tph to (2 of these run via and 2 run via )

During the evening and on Sundays, a number of Thameslink services are extended beyond St Albans City to and .

From the December 2024 timetable change the off-peak service between London Victoria and Orpington doubled to 4tph on Mondays to Fridays.


==Connections==
London Buses routes 3, 37, 68, 196, 201, 322, 468, school route 690 and night routes N3 and N68 serve the station.

<text>Thomas J. King (June 4, 1921 – October 25, 2000) was an American biologist.

==Biography==
With Robert William Briggs, he worked on transplantation of somatic cell nuclei from adult frogs into enucleated oocytes this leading to the first clone of an animal in 1952. He was a scientist at the Institute for Cancer Research of the Lankenau Hospital Research Institute (now known as Lankenau Institute for Medical Research) when the work was conducted. King and Briggs were awarded in 1972 the highest honor of the French Academy: the Grand Prix Charles-Leopold Mayer of the Académie des Sciences, Institut de France and were the first Americans to be so honored.

<text>Peckham Rye is an interchange station between the Windrush line of the London Overground and National Rail services operated by Southeastern, Southern and Thameslink, located in Peckham town centre in South London.

==History==
It opened on 1 December 1865 for London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) trains and on 13 August 1866 for London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) trains. It was designed by Charles Henry Driver (1832–1900), the architect of Abbey Mills and Crossness pumping stations, who also designed the grade II listed and stations between here and .

It is between and on the Windrush line, between Denmark Hill and on the Catford loop line, and between Queens Road Peckham and on the Portsmouth Line. It is in Travelcard Zone 2 and is measured from or measured from .

Peckham Rye is a major interchange served by four different routes. Its platforms are on two separate viaducts with a single ticket hall at ground level. Platforms 1 and 2 are on the south viaduct and served by Southern services (London Bridge via Tulse Hill to Beckenham Junction and East Croydon), and Windrush line (London Overground) services (Clapham Junction to Dalston Junction). Platforms 3 and 4 are on the north viaduct and served by Thameslink (Blackfriars to Sevenoaks) and Southeastern (Victoria to Dartford).

==Station improvements==

===Refurbishment===
Ticket gates were installed in May 2009 and during late 2010 the station was refurbished as part of a &#x27;deep clean&#x27; by Southern. A former waiting room for platforms 2 and 3, bricked up for 55 years, was partially restored and temporarily re-opened with a permanent re-opening being planned.

===Future improvements===
Peckham Rye is planned to become a step-free station. The project was planned to be completed in 2021, but has been delayed to 2024. The step-free project, alongside a major station rebuild, is expected to request government funding in 2022, and if approved, construction will start in September 2023 and be completed in late Summer 2025.

<text>Dar Allen Robinson (March 26, 1947 – November 21, 1986) was an American stunt performer and actor. Robinson broke 19 world records and set 21 &quot;world&#x27;s firsts.&quot; He invented the decelerator (use of dragline cables rather than airbags for a &quot;high fall gag&quot;, or a stunt calling for a jump from a high place) which allowed a cameraman to film a top-down view of the stuntman as he fell without accidentally showing the airbag on the ground. This was displayed in his fall from the hotel in the movie &quot;Stick&quot;. The original decelerator can still be seen on display in Moab, Utah.

==Career==
Robinson grew up in Los Angeles, California. At the early age of thirteen, Dar made the cover of &quot;Life&quot; Magazine for his accomplished abilities on the trampoline. Dar&#x27;s father, Jess Weston Robinson, was responsible for the &quot;trampoline sensation&quot; that swept the country. Dar spent many hours helping in his father&#x27;s Gymnastic Supply Company. Dar&#x27;s natural athletic abilities and his accomplished ease on the trampoline would quickly render him the ranking of 3rd place for his division. One of Robinson&#x27;s first major stunts was a 100-foot jump from a cliff into a river for actor Steve McQueen in the 1973 film &quot;Papillon&quot;. In the same year, he appeared as a motorcycle stunt man in the Clint Eastwood film, &quot;Magnum Force&quot;. He is also remembered for driving over the edge of the Grand Canyon and safely parachuting out before hitting the ground. In 1979, he set the world record for a free-fall from a helicopter, dropping 311 feet (95 m) onto an airbag.

In a highly publicized 1979 feat, as the stunt double for actor Christopher Plummer in the 1982 film &quot;Highpoint,&quot; Robinson made a 700-foot free-fall from a deck on the CN Tower, then the world&#x27;s tallest free-standing structure, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

At 220 feet, the stunt from Atlanta&#x27;s Hyatt Regency Hotel (doubling for the Westin Peachtree Plaza) in the 1981 Burt Reynolds film &quot;Sharky&#x27;s Machine&quot; still holds up as the highest free-fall stunt ever performed from a building for a commercially released film. However, despite it being a record-setting fall, only the beginning of the stunt as he goes through the window is used in the film. A dummy was used for the outside wide shot. However, Robinson performed a similar falling stunt for his largest role as an actor in the 1985 Burt Reynolds film &quot;Stick&quot;, but this time all but the end of the stunt is fully visible as he is seen from above falling from a tall building firing a pistol at the same time.

Robinson returned to Toronto to attempt a world record cable jump from the CN Tower for a feature-length television documentary film called &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Spectacular Stuntman&quot;. The first test of the cable using a bag of water equal to Robinson&#x27;s weight smashed into the ground when the braking mechanism failed. High winds and bad weather delayed the jump until August 12, 1980. Although visibly nervous, he leapt from the tower&#x27;s edge, plummeting more than 1,200 feet (366 m) tied to only a 1/8&quot; (3 mm) steel cable, stopping only a short distance above the ground. For this feat he was listed as highest paid stuntman for a single stunt to date in the 1988 &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;. One article claims he received an honorary Academy Award in 1995 for his work, but it is not listed in the academy database.

== Death ==
Dar Robinson&#x27;s stunts were always well planned, and he never broke a bone in his 13-year Hollywood career. On November 21, 1986, on the set of the film &quot;Million Dollar Mystery&quot;, after the completion of the main stunt, the emergency medical staff was dismissed from the set. While filming a routine high speed run by the camera with a fellow stuntman, Robinson rode his stunt motorcycle past the braking point of a turn and straight off a cliff, to his death.

Robinson is interred in the Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. After his death, a documentary on his life was made in 1988 titled &quot;The Ultimate Stuntman: A Tribute to Dar Robinson&quot;.

The last three films on which Robinson worked — &quot;Cyclone&quot;, &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, and &quot;Million Dollar Mystery&quot; — are all dedicated to his memory. Richard Donner&#x27;s dedication in the closing credits of &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; reads, &quot;This picture is dedicated to the memory of Dar Robinson / one of the motion picture industry&#x27;s greatest stuntmen&quot;. He is survived by his wife, Linda and their son Landon as well as his son from a previous marriage, Troy. His son, Shawn Robinson, also a stunt performer, died of heart failure caused by undiagnosed natural causes aged 41 on July 28, 2015.

<text>In mathematics, a semigroupoid (also called semicategory, naked category or precategory) is a partial algebra that satisfies the axioms for a small category, except possibly for the requirement that there be an identity at each object. Semigroupoids generalise semigroups in the same way that small categories generalise monoids and groupoids generalise groups. Semigroupoids have applications in the structural theory of semigroups.

Formally, a &quot;semigroupoid&quot; consists of:
* a set of things called &quot;objects&quot;.
* for every two objects &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; a set Mor(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;) of things called &quot;morphisms from A to B&quot;. If &quot;f&quot; is in Mor(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;), we write &quot;f&quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;.

<text>The Visayan Sea is a sea in the Philippines surrounded by the islands of the Visayas. It is bounded by the islands Masbate to the north, Panay to the west, Leyte to the east, and Cebu and Negros to the south.

The sea is connected to several bodies of water: the Sibuyan Sea to the northwest via the Jintotolo Channel, the Samar Sea to the northeast, the Guimaras Strait to the southwest which leads to Panay Gulf, the Tañon Strait to the south, and the Camotes Sea to the southeast.

The largest island within this sea is Bantayan Island of Cebu province.

The sea is a major fishing ground for sardines, mackerel, and herring the Philippines. In 2020, the Western Visayas accounts for 20 percent of sardines total production in the Philippines.

<text>Rauschenberg is a town in the north of Marburg-Biedenkopf district in Hesse, Germany.

==Geography==
===Location===
Rauschenberg lies at the southern edge of the &quot;Burgwald&quot;, a low mountain range, near Marburg and Kirchhain.

===Neighbouring communities===
Rauschenberg borders in the north on the town of Rosenthal (Waldeck-Frankenberg) as well as on the communities of Wohratal (Marburg-Biedenkopf) and Gilserberg (Schwalm-Eder-Kreis), in the east on the town of Stadtallendorf, in the south on the town of Kirchhain, in the southwest on the community of Cölbe, and in the west on the town of Wetter (all in Marburg-Biedenkopf).

===Municipality divisions===
Rauschenberg consists out of following villages: 
* Albshausen
* Bracht
* Ernsthausen
* Josbach
* Rauschenberg (town)
* Schwabendorf
* Wolfskaute

==History==

Even as far back as 1000, a castle was built in what is now Rauschenberg. After a fire about 1250, almost the whole settlement was destroyed. Shortly after Rauschenberg was founded by the Counts of Ziegenhain, it was granted town rights. When the &quot;von Ziegenhain&quot; family died out in 1450, the castle and the town fell to the House of Hesse. In this time, the castle was expanded and made into a hunting lodge.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Rauschenberg was mostly destroyed and thoroughly plundered by Swedish troops. Ever since the castle was blown up at a Kassel colonel&#x27;s behest two years before the war ended, there has been nothing left of it but a ruin.

==Politics==
===Town council===
Results of municipal election on 6 March 2016:
==Coat of arms==
Rauschenberg&#x27;s civic coat of arms might be described thus: Party per fess; above, in sable a six-pointed star argent; below in Or. It matches the arms used by the town&#x27;s old overlords, the Counts of Ziegenhain. An eight-pointed star in a modification of the Counts coat of arms.

==Town partnership==
* Westende, Belgium.

==Culture and Sightseeing==
===Buildings===
There has not been much left of the castle, later stately home, of Rauschenberg since it was destroyed in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The ruins on the hill over the constituent community – also known as Rauschenberg – are open and free to all.

<text>Lucile Wheeler (born January 14, 1935) is a former alpine ski racer from Canada. She was a double world champion in 1958, the first North American to win a world title in the downhill event.

==Early years==
Wheeler was born in Quebec and grew up in the village of Sainte-Jovite in the Laurentian Mountains. Her family was instrumental in promoting the sport of skiing and her grandfather George Wheeler built the famous Gray Rocks ski centre at Mont-Tremblant, Quebec. He had moved to Quebec from Chazy, New York in the late nineteenth century, hoping to make it rich in the lumber business, but was wiped out by a forest fire.

Taught to ski at the age of two, Wheeler&#x27;s skills were such that she was soon competing against older ski racers. At age 10, she finished seventh in a downhill event at Mont Tremblant in a race that was open to participants of all ages. She won the Canadian junior ski championship in 1947 at age 12 and at 14 was selected to compete for Canada at the World Championships in 1950 in Aspen, Colorado, the first major alpine event held outside of Europe. However, her parents felt she was too young at age 15 to miss school and did not allow her to go.

==Racing career==
The early 1950s was still a time when resources for Canadian skiers were extremely limited. There was very little in the way of government funding to cover expenses for skiers wishing to compete on the world stage or to pay for professional training. Recognizing their daughter&#x27;s gifts, her parents bore the expense for her to spend several winters training in Kitzbühel, Austria. It paid off when she became the first North American Olympic medalist in the downhill in alpine skiing, winning the bronze in 1956 at Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy. She followed this with a spectacular performance at the 1958 World Championships in Bad Gastein, Austria, where she won both the downhill and the giant slalom and took silver in the combined. Upon her return to Canada a month later, she received tumultuous receptions.

Wheeler&#x27;s breakthrough performance resulted in an increase in government funding that enabled other Canadian skiers to compete at the international level. Her achievements were also instrumental in increasing the popularity of the sport both nationwide and in her native Quebec where what was once a remote destination in the Laurentian mountains for only a limited few became a thriving ski area with an abundance of quality facilities that attracts hundreds of thousands of skiers every winter.

==After racing==
Following her retirement from competitive racing at age 24 in 1959, Wheeler, along with Réal Charette, was a ski instructor in a film made at the Banff ski resort that won the American Library Association&#x27;s award as the best educational sports film of 1960. In June 1960, Wheeler married Kaye Vaughan, former player with the Ottawa Rough Riders and member of the Canadian Football League Hall of Fame. The couple lived for a time in Ottawa, but in 1967 they moved to the village of Knowlton, Quebec, in the heart of a ski area in the Eastern Townships. The mother of two children, she organized a ski program at Knowlton High School for children aged 14 and under.

==Honours==
Wheeler was voted the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada&#x27;s most outstanding athlete of 1958 and was inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame. In 1976, she was made a member of the Order of Canada, her country&#x27;s highest civilian honour, and was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame. South of the border, Wheeler was inducted into the U.S. Ski Hall of Fame in 1976.

Glen Mountain, a small Quebec ski hill in West Bolton, honoured her with a trail named &quot;The Wheeler.&quot;

<doc id="528611" wikidata="Q1176739" url="?curid=528611" title="David Stewart, Duke of Rothesay">
<text>David Stewart (24 October 1378 – 26 March 1402) was heir apparent to the throne of Scotland from 1390 and the first Duke of Rothesay from 1398. He was named after his great-granduncle, David II of Scotland, and also held the titles of Earl of Atholl (1398–1402) and Earl of Carrick (1390–1402). He shares with his uncle and arch-rival, Robert Stewart, first Duke of Albany, the distinction of being first dukes to be created in the Scottish peerage. David never became king. His marriage to Mary Douglas, daughter of Archibald the Grim, the third Earl of Douglas, was without issue.

== Life ==
David Stewart, was born to John Stewart, Lord High Steward of Scotland, and his wife, Anabella Drummond, daughter Sir John Drummond, 11th Thane of Lennox, on 24 October 1378. In 1390, when his father acceded as King of Scots (taking the title Robert III), David became first in order of succession to the throne of Scotland as eldest son. He is known to have taken an active part in the political life of the kingdom. In around 1396, for example, he was entrusted with the government or pacification of the northern parts of the kingdom. He is also known to have played an active role in peace negotiations with John of Gaunt in the Marches.

== Marriage contracts ==
In 1395 David was betrothed to Elizabeth de Dunbar, daughter of George Dunbar, 10th Earl of March. This was a strong political alliance because the Earl of March was one of the most powerful and influential men of his time, rivaled only by Archibald Douglas, 3rd Earl of Douglas. A Papal mandate for the marriage was approved but the couple had not wanted to wait and were married before the mandate arrived in August 1395. As a result, they were censured. After applying for absolution for not waiting, the Pope issued a dispensation to the couple dated 10 March 1397 granting that they could &quot;remarry&quot; after a period of separation. 

Instead of remarrying Elizabeth, his wife of almost 2 years, David was betrothed to and married Marjorie Douglas, daughter of the 3rd Earl of Douglas instead. It is sometimes posited that Archibald the Grim was behind it, but the events took place around and after his death, so that is unlikely. His son and heir, another Archibald, the fourth Earl of Douglas, and a close ally of the Duke of Albany, was more likely the person behind his sister&#x27;s marriage to the Duke. Understandably, the Dunbar family was more than upset. They had lost an important political alliance to their greatest rival, Elizabeth&#x27;s honor and marriage prospects were sullied and the entire family insulted. George Dunbar, Earl of March did not react favorably. As a result of the broken betrothal, he left Scotland entirely and joined King Henry IV of England. This was potentially very dangerous for Scotland.

== Lieutenant of Scotland ==
At a meeting of the Estates held in January 1399, it was resolved that David, as heir to the throne, should be appointed &quot;lieutenant&quot; of the kingdom with full sovereign powers for three years, partly due to the infirmity of his father and at a time of civil unrest and conflict with England. Although this gave him an opportunity to flex political muscle, his room for manoeuvre was significantly constrained, however, by a combination of youthful inexperience and the ultimately mortal rivalry of his uncle, Robert Stewart (brother of Robert III; the latter was named John before he became king), Duke of Albany, who had been protector of the kingdom prior to David&#x27;s lieutenancy. Albany was a ruthlessly effective politician with a well developed power base, and his designs on the throne were well understood. 

David appears to have had an ally in his mother, the Queen, who had worked to strengthen her son&#x27;s hand, arranging the great tournament of 1398 in Edinburgh when he was knighted and being present, along with the king, in that same year when David was created Duke of Rothesay, in the same ceremony, performed by Walter Trail, Archbishop of St Andrews, which also created the title Duke of Albany for his uncle. But both the Queen and Archbishop were dead by 1401. His father, the King, appears to have had little ability by that date to influence events effectively.

== Death ==
In late February 1402, while travelling officially to St Andrews, David was arrested just outside the city at Strathtyrum in a sting operation which had been arranged by Albany, at that time in complicit alliance with David&#x27;s brother-in-law, Archibald, the fourth Earl of Douglas, who was offended with Rothesay for his unfaithfulness to his wife, the sister of Douglas. (David&#x27;s father-in-law, the highly influential third Earl, had died two years before, in 1400.) The pretext for David&#x27;s arrest was that the three-year period of his lieutenancy had expired. He was initially held captive in St Andrews Castle, and soon afterwards taken to Falkland Palace, Albany&#x27;s residence in Fife. According to Bower, the prince spent the journey hooded, gagged, bound and mounted backwards on a mule. At Falkland Palace, David remained a prisoner and shortly died there, reputedly of starvation.

He was buried at Lindores Abbey. The King founded a chaplaincy in the parish church of Dundee to pray for his soul, and daily masses were to be said at Deer Abbey and Culross. A few weeks after the funeral, in May 1402, a public enquiry into the circumstances of David&#x27;s death exonerated Albany of all blame.

Four years later, in 1406, David&#x27;s younger brother, James Stewart, succeeded Robert III as king (although at that time remaining uncrowned and in captivity in England) while Albany secured himself as &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Scotland.

== Fictional portrayals ==
David is the subject of an anonymous full-length 18th century verse drama, &quot;The Duke of Rothsay, a tragedy &quot; published and sold in Edinburgh in 1780. The story of his imprisonment is the principal subject of Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Fair Maid of Perth&quot; (1828) in which he is likewise portrayed as tragic victim. He also features as a principal character in relevant novels from Nigel Tranter&#x27;s trilogy about the early Stewart kings, &quot;The Stewart Trilogy&quot; (1976-1977).

<text>Benjamin Louis Paul Godard (18 August 184910 January 1895) was a French violinist and Romantic-era composer of Jewish extraction, best known for his opera &quot;Jocelyn&quot;. Godard composed eight operas, five symphonies, two piano and two violin concertos, string quartets, sonatas for violin and piano, piano pieces and etudes, and more than a hundred songs. He died at the age of 45 in Cannes (Alpes-Maritimes) of tuberculosis and was buried in the family tomb in Taverny in the French department of Val-d&#x27;Oise.

==Life and career==

Godard was born in Paris in 1849. He entered the Conservatoire de Paris in 1863 where he studied under Henri Vieuxtemps (violin) and Napoléon Henri Reber (harmony) and accompanied Vieuxtemps twice to Germany.

In 1876, his &quot;Concerto romantique&quot; was performed at the Concerts Populaires, and other of his large works were also performed at these concerts. In 1878, Godard was the co-winner of the Prix de la Ville de Paris. His winning composition, a dramatic symphony entitled &quot;Le Tasso&quot;, remains one of his most admired works.

From that time until his death Godard wrote a large number of compositions. These include eight operas, among them: &quot;Jocelyn&quot; (the &quot;Berceuse&quot; from which remains Godard&#x27;s best-known composition), performed in Paris in 1888; &quot;Dante&quot;, played at the Opéra-Comique two years later; and &quot;La Vivandière&quot;, left unfinished and completed by Paul Vidal (1863–1931). The last of these was heard at the Opéra-Comique in 1895, and was played in England by the Carl Rosa Opera Company.

He became a professor at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1887, and was made a Chevalier (Knight) of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1889.

==Works==
Godard&#x27;s long list of works includes five symphonies: &quot;Symphonie gothique&quot; (1883), &quot;Symphonie orientale&quot; (1884), and &quot;Symphonie légendaire&quot; (1886); &quot;Concerto romantique&quot; for violin and orchestra (1876), two piano concertos, three string quartets, four sonatas for violin and piano, a sonata for cello and piano, two piano trios, and various other orchestral works. Among his piano pieces may be mentioned Mazurka No. 2, Valse No. 2, &quot;Au Matin&quot;, &quot;Postillon&quot;, &quot;En Courant&quot;, &quot;En Train&quot;, and &quot;Les Hirondelles&quot;. &quot;Florian&#x27;s Song&quot; is also very popular and has been arranged for many instruments. Godard&#x27;s fourth sonata for violin and piano contains a scherzo written in the unusual time signature of . He wrote more than 100 songs.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;Godard&#x27;s compositions are unequal, if only because his productivity was enormous. He was at his best in works of smaller dimensions. Among his more ambitious works, the &quot;Symphonie légendaire&quot; may be singled out as being one of the most distinctive.&quot;

Godard was opposed to the music of Richard Wagner and also highly critical of Wagner&#x27;s antisemitism. Godard&#x27;s musical style was more in tune with those of Felix Mendelssohn and Robert Schumann.

<text>Samar ( ) is the third-largest and seventh-most populous island in the Philippines, with a total population of 1,909,537 as of the 2020 census. It is located in the eastern Visayas, which are in the central Philippines. The island is divided into three provinces: Samar (formerly Western Samar), Northern Samar, and Eastern Samar. These three provinces, along with the provinces on the nearby islands of Leyte and Biliran, are part of the Eastern Visayas region.

About a third of the island of Samar is protected as a natural park, known as the Samar Island Natural Park.

Many names, such as &quot;Samal&quot;, &quot;Ibabao&quot;, and &quot;Tandaya&quot;, were given to the island prior to the arrival of the Spaniards in 1596. During the early days of Spanish occupation, Samar was under the jurisdiction of Cebu. It later became part of Leyte in 1735 until its separation to become a distinct province named Samar in 1768. On June 19, 1965, through Republic Act No. 4221, Samar was divided into three provinces: Northern Samar, (Western) Samar and Eastern Samar. The capitals of these provinces are, respectively, Catarman, Catbalogan, and Borongan. In commemoration of the establishment of these provinces, June 19 is celebrated as an annual holiday and many have the day off from work.

==Geography==
Samar is the third-largest island in the Philippines by area, after the islands of Luzon and Mindanao. Mount Huraw is Samar&#x27;s highest point, with an elevation of .

Samar is the easternmost island in the Visayas. It lies to the northeast of Leyte, separated from it only by the San Juanico Strait, which at its narrowest point is only about across; the strait is spanned by the San Juanico Bridge. And it lies to the southeast of the Bicol Peninsula on Luzon, separated from it only by the San Bernardino Strait.

To the south is Leyte Gulf, which in October 1944 became the site of one of the most consequential naval battles of World War II. And to the north and east of Samar lies the Philippine Sea, part of the Pacific Ocean.

==History==

=== Spanish accounts ===

==== Events ====

The name for the Samar island was approximated as &quot;Zamal&quot; by Antonio Pigafetta in 1521.

In 1543, Datu Iberein with his official oarsmen approached a Spanish vessel anchored in his harbour. There is also a Samarnon saga that tells the story of Bingi of Lawan.

There are other principalities on the island such as &quot;Ibabao&quot; (or &quot;Cibabao&quot;), &quot;Achan&quot;, &quot;Camlaya&quot;, &quot;Taridola&quot;, and &quot;Candaya&quot;.

==== Foreign descriptions ====

Samar was the first island of the Philippines sighted by the Spanish expedition led by Ferdinand Magellan (transcribed as &quot;Zamal&quot; in the diary of Antonio Pigafetta). He sighted it on 16 March 1521, having sailed there from the Mariana Islands. Realizing he had arrived at an archipelago, he charted the islands, and called them &quot;San Lazaro&quot; (Saint Lazarus in English) because they were sighted on Lazarus Saturday. The Spaniards later called the island Filipinas. Although Samar was the first island of the Philippines sighted by Magellan, he did not land there. He continued south, weighed anchor at Suluan Island, and then finally, on 17 March 1521, he landed on Homonhon Island. Later in the 1700s, Samar was recorded to have about 103 Spanish Filipino families and 3,042 native families.

Years later, other Spanish expeditions arrived. The historian William Henry Scott wrote that a &quot;Samar datu by the name of Iberein was rowed out to a Spanish vessel anchored in his harbor in 1543 by oarsmen collared in gold; while wearing on his own person earrings and chains.&quot; Scott recounted a Samarnon saga, which was called &quot;siday&quot;, about Bingi of Lawan, a prosperous settlement in Samar.

Samar also had names which are recorded in early Spanish sources, including &quot;Ibabao&quot; (or &quot;Cibabao&quot;), &quot;Achan&quot;, &quot;Camlaya&quot;, and &quot;Taridola&quot;. The Spanish captain Miguel Lopez de Legaspi also infamously called the island &quot;Tandaya&quot;, after mistaking the name of a lord with the name of the island (not to be confused with Datu Daya of northern Cebu). This was spelled by Miguel de Loarca as &quot;Candaya&quot;.

=== Philippine-American War ===

The final campaign of the Philippine–American War (1899-1902) took place in Samar and is one of the best known, and most notorious, of the entire war. A combination of factors resulted in particularly violent clashes.

On September 28, 1901, Eugenio Daza, Area Commander of Southeastern Samar and Valeriano Abanador, the town&#x27;s police chief, launched an attack on U.S. Army Company C 9th Infantry Regiment who were occupying Balangiga. This action, commonly known as the &quot;Balangiga massacre&quot;, brought one of the only Filipino victories of the war and the worst American defeat in decades. In 1989, &quot;Balangiga Encounter Day&quot; was established as a provincial holiday in Eastern Samar to celebrate that victory.

The action resulted in the order during the pacification of Samar &quot;I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn; the more you kill and burn, the better it will please me ... The interior of Samar must be made a howling wilderness ...&quot; — Gen. Jacob H. Smith
which brought about the slaughter of thousands of Filipinos by American Marines.

In his history of the war, Brian McAllister Linn asserts &quot;Samar cast a pall on the army&#x27;s achievement and, for generations, has been associated in the public mind as typifying the Philippine War.&quot;

=== World War II ===
The waters off the east side of the island also hosted the Battle off Samar on October 25, 1944, wherein a small, unarmored force of United States Navy escorts fought off the center force of the Imperial Japanese Navy, including the Japanese battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;. During World War II the island was part of a large US Navy base Leyte-Samar Naval Base.

<doc id="528623" wikidata="Q520566" url="?curid=528623" title="Anti-Germans (political current)">
<text>Anti-German () is the generic name applied to a variety of theoretical and political tendencies within the left mainly in Germany and Austria. The anti-Germans form one of the main camps within the broader Antifa movement, alongside the anti-Zionist anti-imperialists, after the two currents split between the 1990s and the early 2000s as a result of their diverging views on Israel. The anti-Germans are a fringe movement within the German left: In 2006 &quot;Deutsche Welle&quot; estimated the number of anti-Germans to be between 500 and 3,000. The basic standpoint of the anti-Germans includes opposition to German nationalism, a critique of mainstream left anti-capitalist views, which are thought to be simplistic and structurally antisemitic, and a critique of antisemitism, which is considered to be deeply rooted in German cultural history. As a result of this analysis of antisemitism, support for Israel and opposition to Anti-Zionism is a primary unifying factor of the anti-German movement. The critical theory of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer is often cited by anti-German theorists.

== Emergence ==
The rapid collapse of the German Democratic Republic and the looming reunification of Germany triggered a major crisis within the German Left. The anti-German tendency first developed in a discussion group known as the &quot;Radical Left&quot;, which consisted of elements of the German Green Party, Trotskyists, members of the Communist League &quot;(Kommunistischer Bund)&quot;, the journal konkret, and members of Autonome, Libertarian and Anarchist groups, who rejected plans by other segments of Leftist political organisations to join a governing coalition. This circle adopted a position developed by the Kommunistischer Bund, a decidedly pessimistic analysis with regard to the potential for revolutionary change in Germany. Known as the &quot;Fascisation&quot; analysis, this theory held that due to the particularity of German history and development, the endemic crisis of capitalism would lead to a move towards the far right and to a new Fascism.

During an internal debate, representatives of the majority tendency said that the minority current, due to its bleak analysis and unwavering pessimism, might as well just emigrate to the Bahamas. The minority tendency, in an ironic gesture, thus named their discussion organ &quot;Bahamas&quot;. In 2007 &quot;Haaretz&quot; described &quot;Bahamas&quot; as &quot;the leading publication of the hardcore pro-Israel, anti-German communist movement.&quot; The phrase &quot;Nie wieder Deutschland&quot; (&quot;Germany, Never Again&quot;), which became a central anti-German slogan, originated in demonstrations against reunification, the largest of which attracted a crowd of approximately 10,000 people. This early alliance dissipated shortly after the process of reunification was complete.

== Development in the 1990s ==

The notion of a revival of German nationalism and racism as a result of the reunification seemed to confirm itself over the course of the 1990s, as shown by such events as the Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots and a murderous attack on a Turkish family in the West German town of Solingen. This wave of anti-immigrant violence led to tightening of Germany&#x27;s hitherto liberal asylum laws.

As a result of these conflicts, through the 1990s, small groups and circles associated with anti-German ideas began to emerge throughout Germany, refining their ideological positions by dissenting from prevailing opinions within the German Left. These positions became particularly prominent within &quot;Anti-fascist&quot; groups. The Gulf War in 1990 consolidated the Anti-German position around a new issue, specifically criticism of the broader Left&#x27;s failure to side with Israel against rocket attacks launched into civilian areas by the regime of Saddam Hussein. Leading left-wing writers such as Eike Geisel and criticised the German peace movement for failing to appreciate the threat posed by Ba&#x27;athism to left-wing movements through the Middle East, in particular around the Iraqi regime&#x27;s use of poison gas.

The outbreak of the Second Intifada provided another focal point for the emerging anti-German movement. While other left-wing analysis identified Israel as an aggressor to the point they were perceived by the Anti-German movement as supporting Islamist groups such as Hamas, the Anti-German camp called for unconditional solidarity with Israel, explicitly Jews and other non-Arab groups native to the region against pan-Arabist ideology. This resulted in leading Anti-German publications including &quot;Konkret&quot; and &quot;Bahamas&quot; to draw links between the antisemitism of Islamist groups and the antisemitism of the Nazis, as both groups upheld the extermination of the Jews as central to their politics. This break with other left-wing positions was further intensified by the September 11 attacks on America, with anti-Germans strongly criticising other leftist positions that claimed that Al-Qaeda&#x27;s assault on the United States was motivated by anti-imperialist or anti-capitalist resistance against American hegemony, instead claiming that Al-Qaeda and their attacks represented a modern form of fascism that needed to be stringently opposed.

In 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of the bombing of Dresden, anti-Germans praised the bombing on the grounds that so many of the city&#x27;s civilians had supported Nazism. Kyle James points to this as an example of a shift towards support for the United States that became more pronounced after 9/11. Similar demonstrations are annually held, the slogans &quot;Bomber Harris, do it again!&quot; and &quot;Deutsche Täter sind keine Opfer!&quot; (&quot;German perpetrators are no victims!&quot;) have become common.

The 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia was also a focus of opposition for the anti-Germans, as for most of the radical left. Many anti-Germans condemned the war as a repetition of the political constellation of forces during the Second World War, with the Serbs in the role of victim of German imperialism. Some anti-Germans thus issued a call for &quot;unconditional&quot; support for the regime of Slobodan Milošević. The reasons the German government gave to legitimize the war – from an anti-German perspective – marked a turning point in the discourse of governmental history-policy. The war was not justified &quot;despite but because of Auschwitz&quot;. This judgment is often combined with the analysis of the genesis of a new national self as the &quot;Aufarbeitungsweltmeister&quot; or &quot;Weltmeister der Vergangenheitsbewältigung&quot; (world champion in dealing with and mastering one&#x27;s own past evil deeds).

Later anti-German focal points included the Stop The Bomb Coalition, active in both Germany and Austria, to maintain sanctions against Iranian attempts to obtain nuclear weapons.

The anti-Germans (and the Deutsch-Israelische Gesellschaft) have produced many of the anti-antisemitism commissioners hired by German institutions after the 2015 European migrant crisis.

==Criticisms==
Zionist leftists that are (often against their self-designation) linked to the Antideutsche movement in Germany and Austria have been accused of targeting left-wing German Jews and Austrian Jews. According to Haaretz writer Ofri Ilany, &quot;Incensed Germans, some of them descendants of Nazis, don&#x27;t hesitate to attack Jewish and Israeli left-wingers&quot; and &quot;besmirch Jews&quot; and violate their freedom of expression &quot;under the banner of the struggle against anti-Semitism.&quot; Left-wing Austrian-Jewish activist Isabel Frey said that &quot;Jews are fetishized in this pseudo-tolerant way and assumed to have unified interests&quot; by the political mainstream in Austria and Germany. According to Frey, &quot;Jewish leftists are being accused of antisemitism by non-Jewish leftists. To me, these accusations are a way of denigrating our Jewish identities, of saying that we’re the “wrong kind” of Jew. I keep asking myself, are these accusations themselves a kind of antisemitism?&quot; Michael Sappir, an Israeli-born German-Jewish anti-Zionist activist affiliated with Jewish-Israeli descent in Leipzig, has said in +972 Magazine that the experience of being an anti-Zionist Jewish leftist in Germany can be disempowering and &quot;very isolating&quot; because the German left is often associated with the Antideutsch movement. According to Sappir, Jewish leftists and other pro-Palestinian voices are marginalized in part because &quot;Antideutsch groups have managed to bully them into silence&quot; and that Jewish leftists &quot;felt very insulted by the idea of calling this struggle &#x27;antisemitic&#x27;&quot;. Despite accusations of anti-Semitism, there is close collaboration and solidarity between those associated with Antideutsche movement and Zionist leftist Jewish organizations, as e.g. the Autonome Jüdische Gruppe Berlin or the (representing the Jewish students in Austria).

<text>Gustav Cornelius Gurlitt (10 February 1820 – 17 June 1901) was a German composer. He was a classmate of Carl Reinecke, whose father was head of the Leipzig Conservatory. Gurlitt studied with Reinecke&#x27;s father for six years. His first public appearance at the age of seventeen was well received, and he decided to go to Copenhagen to continue his studies. There he studied organ, piano, and composition under Curlander and Weyse. While in Copenhagen he became acquainted with the Danish composer Niels Gade, and they remained friends until Gade&#x27;s death.
In 1842, Gurlitt moved to Hørsholm, where he resided as an organist and a music teacher for four years. He then moved to Leipzig, Germany, where Gade was the musical director for the Gewandhaus concerts. Gurlitt next traveled to Rome, where his brother, Louis Gurlitt, a well-known painter, was studying. Cornelius Gurlitt&#x27;s abilities as a musician were quickly recognized in Rome, and the papal Accademia di Santa Cecilia nominated him an honorary member, and later graduated him as a Professor of Music in 1855. While in Rome he also studied painting with excellent results. On his return to Altona, the Duke of Augustenburg engaged him as teacher for three of his daughters. When the Schleswig-Holstein war broke out in 1848, Gurlitt became a military band master. His output was prodigious in quantity and breadth, ranging from songs and teaching pieces to operas, cantatas, and symphonies. He was born in Altona, Schleswig-Holstein and died in Altona.

<doc id="528631" wikidata="Q1292" url="?curid=528631" title="Flemish Parliament">
<text>The Flemish Parliament (Dutch: , formerly called Flemish Council or &quot;Vlaamse Raad&quot;) constitutes the legislative power in Flanders for matters which fall within the competence of Flanders, both as a geographic region and as a cultural community of Belgium (unlike the French Community and Wallonia, which each have separate legislatures: the Parliament of the French Community and the Parliament of Wallonia).

The Flemish Parliament approves decrees, which are Flemish laws, applicable to all persons in the Flemish Region, and to Flemish institutions in Brussels; it appoints and supervises the Flemish Government; and it approves the Flemish budget. The Flemish Parliament meets in the Flemish Parliament building in central Brussels, and its members and staff are housed in the House of the Flemish Representatives.

==History==
From 1830 until 1970 Belgium was a unitary state with a single government and a bicameral national parliament. The laws issued by Parliament applied to all Belgians, and government ministers exercised their authority across the length and breadth of the country. Between 1970 and 2001 the Belgian Parliament approved five successive constitutional reforms. Slowly they changed Belgium from a unitary into a federal state. Part of this was to give the communities and later the regions, their own parliaments.

On 7 December 1971 the Cultural Council for the Dutch-speaking Cultural Community held its first meeting; later followed a parliament for the Flemish Region. Flanders decided as early as 1980 to merge the Flemish Community with the Flemish Region. As a result, Flanders now has a single parliament and a single government with competence over community as well as over regional matters. This Parliament was called the &quot;Vlaamse Raad&quot; until it was officially renamed &quot;Vlaams Parlement&quot; (Flemish Parliament) on 13 June 1995. Over the last thirty years, Flanders has thus developed into a separate state within the federalised Belgium.

Members are called &quot;Vlaamse Volksvertegenwoordigers&quot;. In English, they are referred to as &quot;Members of the Flemish Parliament&quot; (MFPs), like the MSPs in Scotland and the MEPs in the European Union. The title &quot;Flemish Representative&quot; is also used in English. Since 1995 members of the Flemish Parliament have been directly elected.

Currently, many voices in the Flemish Movement would like the Flemish Parliament to acquire certain sovereign powers in addition to those concerning language, culture and education. Furthermore, among the broader Flemish population a consensus has emerged that the Flemish Parliament should also acquire much larger financial and fiscal autonomy.

== Competencies (Jurisdiction) ==
The Flemish Parliament enacts decrees, which are Flemish laws, either as a decree of the Flemish Community or as a decree of the Flemish Region (or often as a decree combining provisions for both entities). Regional legislation is only applicable to all persons in the Flemish Region whereas community legislation also applies to Flemish institutions or services in Brussels (and thus to persons in Brussels who choose to make use of these institutions or services, such as schools).

No hierarchy exists between (federal) laws and Flemish decrees, as each level is supposed to have clearly defined subject-matter jurisdiction. The basis for the community subject-matter jurisdiction is defined in the Belgian Constitution, but the Special Law on Institutional Reform defines all matters in high detail. They can be summarised as follows:

=== Competencies for the entire Flemish Community ===
# Culture: The Flemish parliament is competent for all cultural matters. This includes protection of the cultural heritage (e.g. literature, fine arts), tourism and the media. The public Flemish radio and television broadcasting company is the VRT.
# Language use: including language use in schools and universities, in the Flemish and local administrations, and in relations between employers and employees in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, with exception of the &quot;language facilities&quot; enjoyed in some municipalities.
# All &quot;matters relating to the person&quot;: youth protection, family policy and childcare, together with policy regarding the handicapped, old age pensioners, equal opportunities and the integration of migrants.
# Education: from kindergarten to university including scholarships, though the establishment of the period of compulsory education, requirements for awarding degrees, and pension schemes for teachers remain at the federal level.
# Health care: including preventive health care, home care, institutions for mental health care, but excluding health insurance, financing of hospitals and most other competencies that remained federal.

=== Competencies for the Flemish Region only ===
# Economy, employment and energy policy: includes government support for business, employment policy, agriculture and fisheries, the distribution of electricity and natural gas, the exploitation of new energy sources and the promotion of responsible use of energy
# Town and country planning, housing, land development &amp; nature conservation: including regional planning, building permits, housing policy, social housing, urban renewal, preservation of monuments and natural sites, land consolidation and nature conservation
# Environment and water policy: including the reduction of air, land and water pollution, noise control, the purification of waste water, the production and distribution of drinking water and waste disposal policy
# Scientific research: this field is the full responsibility of the regional authorities, except for aerospace and military research (that remained federal).
#Public works and transport: includes roads, ports (the Port of Antwerp, Port of Bruges-Zeebrugge, Port of Ghent and the Port of Ostend), the regional airports (including Antwerp International Airport and Ostend-Bruges International Airport), and urban and regional transport.
#Agriculture: includes the Agricultural Investment Fund, the agricultural education, the development of rural regions, the sale of agricultural and horticultural products and the fisheries policy. By the stipulations of the Lambermont Agreement (2001), the regions are competent for almost the complete agricultural policy but a few security aspects like food security and animal welfare which remained under the competence of the federal government.
#Local government: includes the allocating of financial resources to the 300 Flemish municipalities and to the five Flemish provinces, and administrative supervision of these communes and provinces and their laws.

===International affairs===
For all areas within its sphere of competence (both vis-à-vis community or regional competences), the Flemish region can conclude international treaties with other states, whether they are national
states or member states of a federation. This competence includes development cooperation and foreign trade.

==Procedure==
A regular legislative session starts in September, when the Government presents its &quot;September Declaration&quot; (&quot;Septemberverklaring&quot;), a kind of State of the Union. Plenary sessions are usually held on Wednesdays.

The Flemish Parliament largely functions like its federal, community and regional counterparts, &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot;. Bills are usually introduced by the Government (&quot;ontwerp van decreet&quot;), but members of parliament can also propose bills (&quot;voorstel van decreet&quot; or private member&#x27;s bill). Bills are first considered in committee, after which they are put to a vote in the plenary. Votes are usually recorded electronically. For example during the 2009–14 legislature, 407 government bills were adopted, while only 102 private member&#x27;s bills were made law.

==Elections and membership==


118 members are directly elected in the Flemish Region. They have voting rights for both regional and community competencies.
Six members are directly elected in the Brussels-Capital Region by those voters who voted for a Dutch-speaking party in the Brussels regional elections. They have no voting rights for the regional competencies.

The elections take place every five years, simultaneously with the elections for the other regional and community parliaments and for the European Parliament. Thus, de facto the European decision-makers determine when the Flemish Parliament elections occur.

This table shows the distribution of seats following the 2024 regional election:

===Previous legislative terms===
The following table lists each legislative term since 1995, when the Flemish Parliament was first directly elected following the fourth state reform.

The parties are ordered by size in the respective term. Green coloured parties indicate the government majority, whereas red parties form the opposition.

==Officers==
At the beginning of each parliamentary year, on the fourth Monday in September, the Flemish Parliament elects its Speaker. The Speaker chairs the plenary sessions of the Flemish Parliament and acts as its official representative. The speaker determines whether a certain initiative is admissible and thus can be put to parliament at all. The Flemish Ministers take the oath before the Speaker of the Flemish Parliament. Only the head of the Flemish government, the Flemish Minister-President, takes the oath before the King.

The current Speaker of the Flemish Parliament is Liesbeth Homans of the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA).

The Speaker of the Flemish Parliament is assisted by the Bureau, which consists of the Speaker, four Deputy Speakers and three Secretaries. The Bureau is responsible for the day-to-day activities of the Flemish Parliament and meets at least once every two weeks. The Extended Bureau, which consists of the Bureau and the floor leaders of the recognised political fractions in the Flemish Parliament coordinates the political activities of the Flemish Parliament and sets the agenda for the plenary session. It usually meets every week on Monday.

==Committees==
Much of the work of the Flemish Parliament is done in committee. The Flemish Parliament currently has eleven standing committees. Each committee is specialised in a particular subject area and consists of 15 Members of the Flemish Parliament. The primary task of the committees is to examine the texts of decree proposals and organise hearings and discussions on decree proposals. There are usually also ad hoc committees, such as the Digital Flanders Committee and the Flemish Constitution Committee.

<text>Marie Pauline Hall (8 April 1884 – 11 November 1956) was an English violinist.

== Biography ==
Hall was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. She received her first lessons from her father, who was a harpist in the orchestra of the Carl Rosa Opera Company. She also studied with a local teacher, Hildegarde Werner. Hall&#x27;s family moved around the country with her father and spent some years in Guarlford, a small village near Malvern. When she was nine, Émile Sauret heard her play, and she gained one of the recently instituted Wessely Exhibitions at the Royal Academy of Music, London: but owing to her father&#x27;s lack of means she did not take it up.

She continued to study under several well known teachers, including a year with Edward Elgar in 1894 aged 10, August Wilhelmj in London in 1896, and in Birmingham in 1898. The story goes that a clergyman found her in a half-starved condition playing for coppers in the streets of Bristol, took her to London and with the assistance of some friends—including W. Ebsworth Hill of the renowned violin makers W.E. Hill &amp; Sons, composer Jane Roeckel and philanthropist Philip Napier Miles—placed her in a position to receive lessons from Professor Johann Kruse (who had studied with Joachim) in 1900. In 1901, upon the advice of Jan Kubelík, she went to study under his former tutor Otakar Ševčík in Prague. 

Hall played for the first time in Prague in November 1902, Vienna in January 1903, and made her London début on 16 February 1903 aged nineteen with Henry Wood at St James&#x27;s Hall. The demanding programme included Paganini&#x27;s first concerto, the Tchaikovsky concerto and Henryk Wieniawski&#x27;s &quot;Fantaisie Brillante&quot; on themes from &quot;Faust&quot;. She scored a success in all these places. She made an international concert tour in 1904, playing in Germany, Canada, America and Australia, including an impromptu concert in a large marquee in Fiji with a particularly badly-tuned piano.

She made a tour through South Africa in 1910, for which she received £10,000 ($50,000) said at the time to be the largest ever paid to a violinist.

She possessed a technique that she believed was due to Ševčík&#x27;s teaching. While she appeared to be not very strong physically, Hall proved herself strong enough to go on long tours and perform exacting programs without fatigue.

Ralph Vaughan Williams completed &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot; with Hall&#x27;s assistance, and dedicated it to her. She gave the first public performances, that for violin and piano at a concert of the Avonmouth and Shirehampton Choral Society on 15 December 1920, and that for violin and orchestra at the Queen&#x27;s Hall with the British Symphony Orchestra under Adrian Boult on 14 June 1921. She owned and played one of the two Viotti Stradivarius violins.

In 1916, she recorded an abridged version of the Elgar Violin Concerto with the composer conducting.

Hall has been described as &quot;perhaps the most successful woman violinist of any during the pre-war period, a truly international celebrity,” and as &quot;a very charming woman, very small and jolly and with a great sense of humour. She was also extremely generous.&quot; She died in Cheltenham on 11 November 1956.

The 1709 Stradivarius violin which she played for more than 50 years, now known as the &quot;Marie Hall Stradivarius,” was sold at Sotheby&#x27;s in April 1988 for a record £473,000 to an anonymous South American bidder.

== Personal life ==
In 1911, Hall married her business manager Edward Baring; they settled in Cheltenham and had one child, Pauline. For the last years of her life she lived in Cheltenham in a large Victorian villa, &quot;Inveresk&quot;, in Eldorado Road.

<text>The Parliament of Wallonia (, ), or the Walloon Parliament (, ) in the decrees, is the legislative body of Wallonia, one of the three self-governing regions of Belgium (the other two being Flanders and the Brussels-Capital Region). The parliament building, the former Hospice Saint-Gilles, is situated in Namur, the capital of Wallonia, at the symbolic confluence of the Meuse and the Sambre, the two main rivers of the most inhabited parts of Wallonia, the &quot;Sillon industriel&quot;. On the other side of the Meuse, facing the Parliament, is the &quot;Élysette&quot;, the seat of the Government of Wallonia.

==History and names==
A 1974 law on the temporary creation of regions installed a Walloon Regional Council (alongside a Flemish Regional Council), which were both abolished in 1977. At the creation of the first (permanent) regional assemblies in 1980 (second state reform), the body was also called &quot;Walloon Regional Council&quot; (&quot;Conseil régional wallon&quot;). Its members were the national representatives and senators elected in the Walloon Region, who thus by law held two offices simultaneously.

The fourth state reform (1993), transformed Belgium into a federal state and changed the &quot;Walloon Regional Council&quot; (&quot;Conseil régional wallon&quot;) into the &quot;Council of the Walloon Region&quot; (&quot;Conseil de la Région wallonne&quot;), which was directly elected for the first time on 21 May 1995. Shortly before these elections, in April 1995, the Council adopted a resolution to use the terms &quot;Walloon Parliament&quot; (&quot;Parlement wallon&quot;) and &quot;Walloon deputies&quot; (&quot;députés wallons&quot;).

A 2005 constitutional amendment revised the official terminology for all community and regional councils into community and regional parliaments, changing the &quot;Council of the Walloon Region&quot; into the &quot;Walloon Parliament&quot; (&quot;Parlement wallon&quot;).

In 2015, the Parliament opted to use the term &quot;Parliament of Wallonia&quot; (&quot;Parlement de Wallonie&quot;) instead of &quot;Walloon Parliament&quot;.

==Composition==
All members of the Parliament of Wallonia are also members of the Parliament of the French Community, except for German-speaking members, who represent the German-speaking population and are advisory members of the Parliament of the German-speaking Community.

The parliament exercises several functions:
* It discusses and passes decrees, and they can take initiatives to draw them up. After this, decrees are sanctioned and promulgated by the Walloon Government.
* It controls the Walloon Government. Control is exercised via the vote.
* It ratifies the international treaties linked to its powers.

== Constituencies ==
The Walloon Parliament is the only Belgian parliament which still uses arrondissement-based constituencies. The federal Chamber of Representatives and the Flemish Parliament both merged theirs into larger province-based constituencies.

A January 2018 law merged both Luxembourg constituencies and reformed the Hainaut constituencies (* = boundaries changed), following a successful challenge by Ecolo to the Constitutional Court that constituencies with too few seats are unrepresentative.

<doc id="528638" wikidata="Q1576377" url="?curid=528638" title="San Bernardino Strait">
<text>The San Bernardino Strait () is a strait in the Philippines, connecting the Samar Sea with the Philippine Sea. It separates the Bicol Peninsula of Luzon from Samar of Visayas.

==History==
During an ill-fated expedition, only one ship, the little &quot;San Juan de Letran&quot; with a skeleton crew of only 20 men, logged more than 5,000 kilometres in Philippine waters, including those of the San Bernardino Strait, and the San Juanico Strait between Samar and Leyte.

The &quot;San Juan&quot; also completely circumnavigated the island of Mindanao, then tried to reach Mexico but was blown back to the Marianas by a storm in the North Pacific. It made its way back to the &quot;Filipinas&quot; (as Samar and Leyte had been named by Villalobos), and on January 3, 1544 ran aground in the treacherous currents of the San Bernardino Strait &quot;just as dozens of Spanish vessels were to do for the next three centuries&quot;.

In order to guide ships traversing along the strait, the Capul Island Lighthouse was built from 1893 to 1896 under Francisco Perez Muñoz, following the designs of Guillermo Brockman in 1892. The Capul Island Lighthouse was declared as a national historical landmark by the province of Northern Samar on September 29, 2013.

===Second World War===
During the Battle of Leyte Gulf, Imperial Japanese Admiral Kurita took his main battleship force through the strait to reach the American transports anchored in Leyte Gulf, but withdrew after the Battle off Samar.

<text>Guy d&#x27;Hardelot (August 1858 – 7 January 1936) was the pen name of Helen Rhodes (&quot;née&quot; Helen Guy), a French composer, pianist and teacher.

== Biography ==
D&#x27;Hardelot was born Helen Guy, to an English father and a French mother, at Château d&#x27;Hardelot, near Boulogne-sur-Mer.

At the age of 15, she went to Paris, where she studied at the Conservatoire de Paris under Marie Renaud-Maury (1852-1928) and came to the notice of Charles Gounod and Victor Maurel, who were much impressed with her ability. She also met Jules Massenet, who encouraged her to compose. On coming to London, she became a pupil of Clarence Lucas. Emma Calvé was a good friend to d&#x27;Hardelot and did much to bring her songs to notice.

Most of her life, d&#x27;Hardelot was engaged in teaching singing and diction at her home in London and many of her pupils attained success. In 1896, she toured the United States with Calvé. Her first real success as a composer was won with &quot;Because&quot;, though her song &quot;Sans Toi&quot; had previously been favorably received. Among her other successes were &quot;I Know a Lovely Garden&quot;, &quot;I Think&quot;, &quot;I Hid My Love&quot;, &quot;Dawn&quot; and &quot;A Bunch of Violets&quot;.

She was singularly successful as a writer of songs, in which she combined French delicacy with English solidity. Few women composers became more popular in the early 20th century than did d&#x27;Hardelot, and her success was won on merit alone. In spite of the help of many friends, it was some time before she achieved this success.

Her sister, Edith Dick, was also a composer.

<doc id="528640" wikidata="Q1358975" url="?curid=528640" title="Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan">
<text>Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, called the Wolf of Badenoch (1343 – July 1394), was a Scottish royal prince, the third son of King Robert II of Scotland by his first wife Elizabeth Mure. He was Justiciar of Scotia and held large territories in the north of Scotland.

He is best remembered for his destruction of the royal burgh of Elgin and its cathedral. His sobriquet was given due to his notorious cruelty and rapacity, but there is no proof that it was used during his lifetime. 

==Power and influence==

Known in charters as Alexander &quot;Senescalli&quot; (Latin for Steward), first noted when, on 14 August 1370, he issued letters patent from Ruthven Castle undertaking to grant protection to the Bishop of Moray and all of his lands, men and property in Badenoch. His father, Robert the Steward, had acquired the lands of Badenoch probably from Euphemia, Countess of Moray who had become his second wife. 

Robert had a petulant relationship with his uncle, King David II of Scotland. In 1368, he and his sons were required by David&#x27;s parliament to take an oath that they would keep their undisciplined followers in check—later that year, Robert and Alexander were imprisoned in Lochleven Castle possibly as a result of these oaths having been broken. Following Robert&#x27;s accession to the throne, Alexander was formally made Lord of Badenoch on 30 March 1371.

Alexander&#x27;s possession of Badenoch was unaffected by the restoration of the Earldom of Moray to John Dunbar in March 1372, nor were the territories of John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles, in Lochaber—similarly with the lands of Urquhart (south of Inverness) which had been granted to David Stewart, Earl of Strathearn and King Robert&#x27;s eldest son with his second wife, Euphemia. Alexander further extended his territorial gains in 1371 by leasing the Urquhart lands from his younger half-brother and then obtained possession of the Barony of Strathavon bordering his Badenoch lands. 

In October 1372, Alexander was given the Royal Lieutenancy for those lands outwith the Earldom of Moray north and west of Inverness and added lands in Aberdeenshire and north Perthshire. In the same year, he was Royal Justiciar in the Appin of Dull in Perthshire which meant that Alexander held crown authority from north Perthshire to the Pentland Firth.

Alexander de Ard, a principal claimant for the Earldom of Caithness as the eldest grandson of Earl Malise, resigned his territories to the crown in favour of both Alexander and his half-brother David. However Alexander effectively doubled his land holdings when he married Euphemia Countess of Ross, in June 1382. 

Alexander became the &quot;jure uxoris&quot; Earl of Ross and this provided him the Ross lands (but only during his own lifetime). Other lands belonging to his wife – including Lewis, Skye, Dingwall and Kingedward in Aberdeenshire – he held in joint ownership with her. His possession of the Barony of Kingedward, a large part of the former Earldom of Buchan allowed King Robert to give Alexander the title of Earl of Buchan only days after his marriage. Alexander ruled these territories with the help of his own private cateran forces, building up resentment among other land owners and this included Alexander Bur, Bishop of Moray.

==Church defiance==

There was no dominant potentate in Moray during the 12th and 13th centuries and the bishops ruled their territories with a great deal of independence, but this ended when King Robert I of Scotland elevated his nephew Thomas Randolph to the Earldom of Moray sometime between 12 April and 29 October 1312. The Randolph family did not hold the Earldom for long and it reverted to the crown on the death of Thomas&#x27;s son John, in 1346, and lay vacant for the next 26 years. In 1365, bishop Bur persuaded David II that his lands in Badenoch and Strathspey should be governed as if in regality. To emphasise this, Bur, when he entered into the protection agreement with Alexander in 1370, ensured that the &quot;de facto&quot; Lord of Badenoch would have no hold on him, nor his lands and people. 

A few months later in March 1371, on his father&#x27;s accession to the throne, Alexander was officially made Lord of Badenoch. Robert II&#x27;s charter gave Alexander the lands of Badenoch seemingly in regality with, presumably, authority over the church lands however, bishop Bur possibly protested at this, as the details of the grant of Badenoch contained in the Register of the Great Seal has no reference to regality. 

Alexander was therefore to hold the Badenoch lands with no greater authority than John Comyn had a century before. The bishop continued to come under pressure from Alexander either directly or from his caterans possibly acting independently. Boardman explains that both the bishops of Moray and Aberdeen were in dispute with Alexander regarding the strain that his cateran followers were putting on church lands and tenants. 

Boardman also theorises that it was this occupation of church lands, virtually rendering them worthless in terms of income, that may have been the reason for Bur &#x27;voluntarily&#x27; giving up his rights to estates such as Rothiemurchas, on 20 April 1382. Complicating matters was the fact that neither of the bishops could appeal to the &#x27;legitimate secular authority&#x27; as that authority was Alexander himself in his positions of Lord of Badenoch and Royal Lieutenant and was the reason why they appealed directly to the King.

==Increasing pressure==

King Robert&#x27;s reputation declined because of his backing Buchan&#x27;s methods and so in November 1384, John, Earl of Carrick with the backing of the general council, took executive authority from his father with lawlessness in the north being a major issue. The Lordship of Strathnairn had been administered by Buchan with the approval of the King, but now under Carrick&#x27;s leadership, Sir David Lindsay was able to reassert his right to Strathnairn. 

In April 1385, at the council, Buchan&#x27;s brother David claimed that Buchan was holding Urquhart unlawfully, while Sir James Lindsay of Crawford reinstated his claim to the Lordship of Buchan and finally, the Earl of Moray demanded that some of Buchan&#x27;s men be prosecuted for the killing of some of his men. Despite these early attacks on his position, Buchan significantly strengthened his territorial position, especially in the Great Glen where he retained Urquhart after his brother&#x27;s death and then in the autumn of 1386 he gained the lands of Bona at the head of Loch Ness from the Earl of Moray and the adjoining lands in Abriachin from Sir Robert Chisholm. 

Buchan&#x27;s increased influence in Scottish affairs was again furthered when sometime before February 1387, he was appointed Justiciar North of the Forth Carrick&#x27;s guardianship of Scotland had not been a success and certainly failed to rein in Buchan and so late in 1388, King Robert&#x27;s second son, Robert, Earl of Fife (Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany) became the effective ruler of the Kingdom. 

Within days, Fife removed Buchan from the Justiciarship and, it is assumed, the Royal Lieutenancy and the Sheriffdom of Inverness and later installed his own son, Murdoch as Justiciar North of the Forth. Fife was very uncompromising towards Buchan, who had been described as &#x27;useless to the community&#x27; at a previous general council meeting. Buchan had long deserted his wife and lived with Mairead inghean Eachainn with whom he had several children, including Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar. Marital law was the prerogative of the Church and so on 2 November 1389, Bishop Alexander Bur of Moray and Bishop Alexander Kylquhous of Ross, ordered his return to his wife, Euphemia. Buchan agreed to this but didn&#x27;t live up to his promise and so Fife encouraged Euphemia of Ross during her divorce proceedings against Buchan and, in 1392, Euphemia was successful in her appeal to the Avignon papal court and his marriage was annulled. Following the annulment, Buchan lost all claim to Euphemia&#x27;s lands which returned to her and to her son Alexander Leslie, Earl of Ross who contracted to marry Fife&#x27;s daughter.

==Burning of Elgin and aftermath==

King Robert II died at Dundonald Castle in Ayrshire on 19 April 1390 and the chronicler Wyntoun informs that Robert was not buried at Scone until 13 August 1390, only a day before his son John, Earl of Carrick was crowned King as Robert III. Fife was retained as Guardian of Scotland probably much against Buchan&#x27;s hopes as he must have looked at some sort of volte-face on some of Fife&#x27;s actions, particularly as Buchan reached his zenith of possessions under Carrick. On top of this, Bishop Bur turned to Thomas Dunbar, Sheriff of Inverness and son of the Earl of Moray to provide his protection. The events of May and June 1390 in the Laich of Moray were perhaps the result of a combination of factors that presented themselves to Buchan. Firstly, John Dunbar, Earl of Moray and his fellow northern landowner Sir David Lindsay of Glenesk both absented themselves from Moray to attend a substantial tourney at Richard II of England&#x27;s court. In addition, Bishop Bur&#x27;s involvement with Buchan&#x27;s estrangement with his wife and then Bur&#x27;s alignment with Moray presented an opportunity for revenge culminating in the destruction of Forres in May and then Elgin with its cathedral in June. His destruction of the church possessions in Elgin was complete—as well as the cathedral, the monastery of the Greyfriars, St Giles parish church and the Hospital of Maison Dieu were all put to flame. Church and state now came together to oppose him—excommunicated by Bur, Buchan had to appear at the Church of the Friars Preacher, in Perth in the presence of his brothers, King Robert III of Scotland and the Earl of Fife, and the council-general to plead for forgiveness—absolution was granted by bishop Walter Trail, Bishop of St Andrews.

Buchan&#x27;s brutal assault on Moray in 1390 was to some extent intended to extricate himself from Fife&#x27;s domination but turned out to be unsuccessful—Alexander was to lose his Lordship of Urquhart in 1392 and then his claim on Ross following his wife&#x27;s divorce in 1392. Fife&#x27;s influence waned during the mid-1390s while that of King Robert and his son David, Earl of Carrick increased—the King took back responsibility for Scottish-English relations and had manoeuvred the Red Douglas Earl of Angus into a dominating position in southeastern Scotland at the expense of Fife&#x27;s ally, the Black Douglas. Although Fife&#x27;s authority over Scottish affairs had lessened he still exercised considerable power in government. Fife and Carrick both campaigned against Buchan and his sons and other lawless elements in the west and north. Although Buchan appeared to have halted his violent traits after this, his sons did not. A fight ensued near Pitlochry involving Duncan and Robert Stewart at the head of a band of caterans when Sir Walter Ogilvie and Walter de Lychton and followers were killed. Later it is recorded that three sons of Buchan were imprisoned in Stirling Castle from 1396 to 1402, perhaps the reason for Buchan&#x27;s low profile during the later 1390s.

Buchan is again mentioned at Spynie Castle on 3 May 1398 being ordered to deliver it up to William, bishop of Moray by Robert III. Buchan appears to have left the north in his latter years appearing as Baillie of the Earldom of Atholl in 1402 and a mention in 1404 in Perth. However, several sources indicate he died in July 1394, which causes one to wonder to whom is being referred in 1398 and 1404 if not his son by the same name.

Buchan having acquired vast territories in the north lost a large part of them during his own lifetime (lands of Ross and Urquhart). He held royal appointments only to have them removed (Justiciar of Scotia and Royal Lieutenant north of the Moray Firth.) He was unsuccessful in maintaining law and order and this seen alongside his inability to hold onto his Ross territories demonstrated his ineffectiveness. He died circa 20 July 1405 and was buried at Cathedral of Dunkeld, Perthshire. His chest tomb, topped by an effigy in armour, is one of the few Scottish royal monuments to have survived from the Middle Ages.

==Death==

Stewart is buried in Dunkeld Cathedral with a handsome and somewhat defaced monument, with the description: &quot;His Jacet Domninus Alexander Senescallus, Dominus De Badenoch, Bonæ Memorle, Qui Obit 24 Die Mensis Julii, Anno Domini 1394&quot;.

There is a legend that Stewart—the &quot;Wolf of Badenoch&quot;—died after a chess game with the Devil. According to this legend, Stewart was visited at Ruthven Castle by a tall man dressed in black. The two played chess through the night, with a storm rising when the stranger called &quot;Check&quot; and &quot;Check Mate&quot;. The legend says that the next morning the Wolf of Badenoch was found dead in the castle&#x27;s hall, with his men dead outside the castle walls. 

==Mairead inghean Eachann==
According to historian Angus Mackay, Alexander Stewart the Wolf of Badenoch&#x27;s mistress, Mairead inghean Eachainn, was, in fact, Mariota Mackay, daughter of Iye Mackay, 4th of Strathnaver. There is however no evidence for this assertion. Stewart and Mairead had several illegitimate children, including Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar.

The Mackay historian explains that Mariota Mackay who is described in Latin as &quot;Mariota filia Athyn&quot;, being the &quot;handfasted&quot; wife of Alexander Stewart the Wolf of Badenoch, would explain Stewart&#x27;s friendship with Farquhar Mackay who was Mariota Mackay&#x27;s brother and physician to Robert II of Scotland. It would also explain why a party of Mackay&#x27;s supported Stewart the Wolf of Badenoch in a raid into the Braes of Angus in 1391. It may well also have served as a motive for Angus Du Mackay, 7th of Strathnaver having supported Alexander Stewart the Earl of Mar, son of the Wolf, at the Battle of Dingwall in 1411 against Donald of Islay, Lord of the Isles, as Mackay and Stewart the Earl of Mar would have been cousins.

<text>The Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region (; ) is the governing body of the Brussels-Capital Region, one of the three regions of Belgium. It is also known as the Brussels Regional Parliament (; ).

==Elections==
Elections of 75 Brussels regional deputies, 89 since 2004, take place every five years. Here is the list of past regional elections:
* 18 June 1989 (first elections)
* 21 May 1995, coincided with the federal legislative elections;
* 13 June 1999, coincided with the European Parliament election;
* 13 June 2004, coincided with the European Parliament election;
* 7 June 2009, coincided with the European Parliament election;
* 25 May 2014 coincided with the European Parliament election;
* 26 May 2019, coincided with the European Parliament election;
* 9 June 2024, coincided with the European Parliament election

===Current composition===

The composition of the Brussels Parliament is as follows:
== Previous compositions ==
2004–2009

2009–2014

2014–2019

2019–2024

2024–present


== Functions ==
The Brussels Parliament role mainly consists in controlling the government of the Brussels-Capital Region, approving the budget and creating and passing legislation in regional matters, known as ordinances, which are legally binding. One of its first tasks after the Parliament is renewed is appointing five ministers and three regional secretaries of state, who together form the cabinet of the Brussels-Capital Region.

The Brussels Parliament can also force the cabinet as a whole or one or more of its members to resign by passing a motion of no confidence. However, because the Parliament cannot be dissolved prior to the end of its five-year term, such a motion is only admissible if it is a constructive motion, in other words, the Parliament must decide upon a successor to the cabinet or to one or more of its members.

The 89 members of the Brussels Parliament are divided into two language groups: 72 belong to the French-speaking group and 17 members belong to the Dutch-speaking group. The members of the French-speaking group also make up the &quot;Parlement francophone bruxellois&quot; (English: Francophone Brussels Parliament), which was formerly known as the Assembly of the French Community Commission, while the members of the Dutch-speaking group make up the Council of the Flemish Community Commission. The &quot;Parlement francophone bruxellois&quot; and the Council of the Flemish Community Commission together form the United Assembly of the Common Community Commission. The Community Commissions are to a certain extent responsible for Community competencies within the Brussels-Capital Region.

19 of the 72 French-speaking members of the Brussels Parliament are also members of the Parliament of the French Community of Belgium, and until 2004 this was also the case for six Dutch-speaking members, who were at the same time members of the Flemish Parliament. Nowadays, people voting for a Flemish party have to vote separately for 6 directly-elected members of the Flemish Parliament.

Due to the multiple capacities of single members, there are members of the Brussels Parliament who are simultaneously members of the Parliament of the French Community of Belgium and of the Senate as &quot;community senators&quot; for the French Community. At the moment, this is the case for François Roelants du Vivier (MR), (PS) and Sfia Bouarfa (PS). However, there are certain restrictions in place in order to prevent one person from combining too many mandates. For instance, it is not possible to be a member of the Chamber of Representatives and of one of the Regional Parliaments at the same time.

<text>Robert Scheer (born April 4, 1936) is an American left-wing journalist who has written for &quot;Ramparts&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Hustler Magazine&quot;, &quot;Truthdig&quot;, &quot;ScheerPost&quot; and other publications as well as having written many books. His column for &quot;Truthdig&quot; was nationally syndicated by Creators Syndicate in publications such as &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;. He is a clinical professor of communications at the Annenberg School for Communication &amp; Journalism at the University of Southern California. Scheer is the former editor in-chief for the Webby Award-winning online magazine &quot;Truthdig&quot;. For many years, he co-hosted the nationally syndicated political analysis radio program &quot;Left, Right &amp; Center&quot; on National Public Radio (NPR), produced at public radio station KCRW in Santa Monica. The Society of Professional Journalists awarded Scheer the 2011 Sigma Delta Chi Award for his column.

==Early life==
Scheer was born and raised in the Bronx, New York City. His mother, Ida Kuran, was a Russian Jew, and his father, Frederick Scheer, was a Protestant native of Germany; both worked in the garment industry. Robert graduated from Christopher Columbus High School in the Bronx. After graduating from City College of New York with a degree in economics, he studied as a fellow at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, and then did further economics graduate work at the Center for Chinese Studies at UC Berkeley. Scheer has also been a Poynter fellow at Yale University, and was a fellow in arms control at Stanford University.

==The &quot;Ramparts&quot; years==
In 1962 in Berkeley, California, Scheer along with David Horowitz, Maurice Zeitlin, Phil Roos, and Sol Stern founded &quot;Root and Branch: A Radical Quarterly&quot;, one of the earliest campus New Left journals.

While working at City Lights Books in San Francisco, Scheer co-authored &quot;Cuba, an American Tragedy&quot; (1964) with Maurice Zeitlin. Between 1964 and 1969, he served, variously, as the Vietnam War correspondent, managing editor, and editor-in-chief of &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine in San Francisco. Scheer reported from Cambodia, China, North Korea, Russia, Latin America and the Middle East (including the Six-Day War), as well as on national security matters in the United States. While in Cuba, where he interviewed Fidel Castro, Scheer obtained an introduction by the Cuban leader for the diary of Che Guevara — which Scheer had already obtained, with the help of French journalist Michele Ray, for publication in &quot;Ramparts&quot; and by Bantam Books. After &quot;Ramparts&quot; collapsed, Scheer became a freelance writer who was published in major magazines including &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Lear&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;.

==Congressional run==
In the late 1960s, Scheer made a bid for elective office as an anti-Vietnam War candidate. He challenged U.S. Representative Jeffery Cohelan in the 1966 Democratic primary. Cohelan was a liberal, but like most Democratic officeholders at that time, he supported the Vietnam War. Mathematician Serge Lang served as Scheer&#x27;s campaign treasurer. Scheer lost, but won over 45% of the vote (and carried Berkeley), a strong enough showing against an incumbent to represent an indicator of the strength of New Left Sixties radicalism. (Cohelan would lose re-nomination four years later to anti-war Berkeley City Councilman Ron Dellums.)

In 1968, Scheer signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse to pay taxes in protest against the Vietnam War.

In July 1970, Scheer accompanied as a journalist a Black Panther Party delegation, led by Eldridge Cleaver, who also wrote for &quot;Ramparts&quot;, to North Korea, China, and Vietnam. The delegation also included people from the San Francisco Red Guard, the women&#x27;s liberation movement, the Peace and Freedom Party, Newsreel, and the Movement for a Democratic Military.

In the November 1970 California elections, Scheer ran for the U.S. Senate as the nominee of the Peace and Freedom Party against Republican senator George Murphy and Democratic Congressman John V. Tunney. Scheer received 56,731 votes and lost the election to Tunney.

==&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and Public Radio==
After several years freelancing for magazines, including &quot;New Times&quot; and &quot;Playboy,&quot; Scheer joined the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1976 as a reporter. There he met Narda Zacchino, a reporter whom he later married in the paper&#x27;s news room. As a national correspondent for 17 years at the &quot;LA Times&quot;, he wrote articles and series on diverse topics such as the Soviet Union during glasnost, the Jews of Los Angeles, arms control, urban crises, national politics and the military, and covered several presidential elections. The &quot;LA Times&quot; entered Scheer&#x27;s work for the Pulitzer Prize 11 times, and he was a finalist for the Pulitzer national reporting award for a series on the television industry.

After Scheer left the &quot;LA Times&quot; in 1993, the paper granted him a weekly op-ed column which ran every Tuesday for the next 12 years until it was canceled in 2005. The column now appears in Truthdig and is distributed nationally by Creators Syndicate. Scheer is also a contributing editor for &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine. He was heard weekly on the nationally syndicated political analysis radio program &quot;Left, Right &amp; Center&quot;, produced at and syndicated by public radio station KCRW in Santa Monica, and is a host of &quot;Scheer Intelligence&quot;, a half-hour KCRW podcast with politically engaged individuals.

Scheer has taught courses at Antioch College, City College of New York, UC Irvine, UCLA and UC Berkeley, and is now a clinical professor at the University of Southern California&#x27;s Annenberg School for Communication, where he teaches two courses each semester on media and society.

Scheer interviewed every president from Richard Nixon through Bill Clinton. He conducted the 1976 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview with Jimmy Carter, in which the then-presidential candidate admitted to having &quot;lusted&quot; in his heart. In an interview with George H. W. Bush, the then presidential candidate revealed that he believed nuclear war was &quot;winnable.&quot; Scheer has profiled politicians from Californians Jerry Brown and Willie Brown to Washington insiders like Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, and figures like actor Tom Cruise.

==Political views==
===Iraq War===
In an August 6, 2002 article, he wrote that &quot;a consensus of experts&quot; informed the Senate that the Iraqi weapons arsenal was &quot;almost totally destroyed during eight years of inspections.&quot; On June 3, 2003, Scheer concluded that White House justifications for the war were a &quot;big lie.&quot; On November 4, 2003, he penned an article in favor of withdrawal from Iraq.

===World War II===
In an April 7, 2010 article, he wrote that Harry Truman perpetrated &quot;the most atrocious act of terrorism in world history when he annihilated the civilian populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki&quot;.

===Russia and Ukraine===
Scheer has accused tech companies of censoring articles that question the &quot;NATO narrative&quot; on the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

===Support of Kentucky Republican for U.S. Senate===
In 2010, Scheer expressed support for Republican Rand Paul, son of former Libertarian presidential candidate and Republican congressman Ron Paul, in his United States Senate campaign in Kentucky.

==End of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; relationship==
Scheer has often expressed highly controversial ideas. In a February 15, 2005 &quot;LA Times&quot; article entitled &quot;What We Don&#x27;t Know About 9/11 Hurts Us&quot;, he stated: &quot;Would George W. Bush have been reelected president if the public understood how much responsibility his administration bears for allowing the 9/11 attacks to succeed?&quot; After running his column for more than 12 years after he had worked as a reporter for the paper 17 years, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; ended a nearly 30-year relationship with Scheer in November 2005, citing the need to cut costs, but subsequently replaced him with two conservative columnists. Scheer said in an interview with &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; that the paper&#x27;s owner, the Tribune Company, owns a newspaper and a television station in the same market, which is illegal, and may have fired Scheer in an attempt to make it easier to obtain a waiver permitting the dual ownership from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). He also commented during a November 14, 2005, appearance on &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;:
What happened is that I had been the subject of vicious attacks by Bill O&#x27;Reilly and Rush Limbaugh. ... I was a punching bag for those guys. I&#x27;m still standing, and the people who run the paper collapsed.

In a posting on &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, Scheer wrote:
The publisher Jeff Johnson, who has offered not a word of explanation to me, has privately told people that he hated every word that I wrote. I assume that mostly refers to my exposing the lies used by President Bush to justify the invasion of Iraq. Fortunately 60 percent of Americans now get the point but only after tens of thousand of Americans and Iraqis have been killed and maimed as the carnage spirals out of control. My only regret is that my pen was not sharper and my words tougher.

Scheer&#x27;s firing incited a protest held outside the &quot;LA Times&quot; downtown office on November 15, and hundreds of readers wrote letters of complaint while some, including Barbra Streisand, publicly announced the cancellation of their &quot;LA Times&quot; subscriptions. Within a few days of his column being retired by the &quot;Times&quot;, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; offered itself as the new home paper of Scheer&#x27;s syndicated column, which ran there for years.

==Truthdig==
On November 29, 2005, Scheer co-launched, as editor in chief, the online news magazine, Truthdig. Scheer&#x27;s column there was syndicated nationally by Creators Syndicate in publications such as &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;. In a 2014 &quot;Los Angeles Magazine&quot; feature about Truthdig, Ed Leibowitz writes, &quot;The columnists and bloggers [of Truthdig] chart an ecosystem in irreversible decline, follow human rights crises and repression overseas, and probe the erosion of American democracy by perpetual war, the disappearance of privacy rights, the abandonment of the poor, and a political system in thrall to corporate titans, gross polluters, and Wall Street crooks. By pursuing these subjects with an intellectual rigor and relentlessness seldom found on the Web, Truthdig has become one of the most critically acclaimed Internet-based news sites in the world. Among the site&#x27;s most covered stories was an atheist manifesto by writer Sam Harris and a searing birthday tribute to slain U.S. Army Ranger and former NFL star Pat Tillman, written by his brother, Kevin.

Truthdig is a four-time recipient of the Webby Award for best political blog, and in 2013, Truthdig won a fifth award for best political site. Truthdig is a winner of multiple awards from the Society of Professional Journalists and the Los Angeles Press Club.

In March 2020, a dispute between Scheer and Truthdig&#x27;s CEO and publisher, Zuade Kaufman, led to a work stoppage by employees who were subsequently fired. In November 2022, after almost two years on &quot;hiatus&quot;, the website relaunched without Scheer&#x27;s involvement. After leaving Truthdig, Scheer launched the website ScheerPost.

==Awards==
Scheer received the 2010 Distinguished Work in New Media Award from the Society of Professional Journalists, and in 2011 Ithaca College named Scheer the winner of the Izzy Award for outstanding achievement in independent media.

Scheer was the 1998 honoree of the Shelter Partnership, an organization of Los Angeles downtown businesses as well as the recipient of the USC School of Social Work&#x27;s Los Amigos Award. He won the James Aronson Award for Social Justice Journalism for his writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot; about the case of nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee. He has also received awards and citations from Stanford University, the Russian Academy of Sciences, the University of California, San Diego, and Yale University.

==Personal life==
Scheer&#x27;s first wife was Serena Turan Scheer. Serena, now the widow of poet Lou Embree, is the older sister of film critic Kenneth Turan. A Brooklyn native, she was on the editorial staff of &quot;Root and Branch&quot; and a reporter on the Oakland Tribune. Scheer and Turan divorced. Scheer married Anne Butterfield Weills in 1965. Their son Christopher Weills Scheer was born September 8, 1968. Scheer and Weills subsequently divorced.

Robert Scheer is now married to Narda Catharine Zacchino. She worked at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; for 31 years, where she became the associate editor and a vice president. She was later deputy editor of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. Zacchino is the co-author of three books and is a senior fellow at USC&#x27;s Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy.

==Books==
Scheer&#x27;s book, &quot;They Know Everything About You: How Data-Collecting Corporations and Snooping Government Agencies Are Destroying Democracy&quot;, was released on February 21, 2015. It was published by Nation Books, who also released Scheer&#x27;s previous book &quot;The Great American Stickup: How Reagan Republicans and Clinton Democrats Enriched Wall Street While Mugging Main Street&quot; on September 7, 2010. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote about the latter book saying that it &quot;proves that, when it comes to the ruling sway of money power, Democrats and Republicans, Wall Street and Washington make very agreeable bedfellows.&quot; The book made the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; bestseller list and on October 17, 2010, was reviewed in the same paper by Jonathan Kirsch, who wrote
:Robert Scheer is a journalist in the gadfly tradition of Lincoln Steffens, I. F. Stone and Seymour Hersh. His latest book, &quot;The Great American Stickup&quot;, blames the &#x27;captains of finance&#x27; for causing the 2008 &#x27;meltdown&#x27; of the global economy in the first place and then profiting from the tax dollars that were thrown at the problem — &#x27;a giant hustle that served the richest of the rich,&#x27; as he puts it, &#x27;and left the rest of us holding the bag.&#x27;

Scheer has written eight other books, including a collection entitled &quot;Thinking Tuna Fish, Talking Death: Essays on the Pornography of Power&quot;; &quot;With Enough Shovels: Reagan, Bush and Nuclear War&quot;; and &quot;America After Nixon: The Age of Multinationals&quot;. In 2004, Scheer published &quot;The Five Biggest Lies Bush Told Us About Iraq&quot;, which became a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Bestseller. It was co-authored by his oldest son, Christopher Scheer, and Lakshmi Chaudhry, senior editor at &quot;Alternet.&quot;

Scheer&#x27;s anthology &quot;Playing President: My Close Encounters with Nixon, Carter, Bush I, Reagan and Clinton – and How They Did Not Prepare Me for George W. Bush&quot; (Akashic Books, 2006), is a collection of his many interviews, profiles, and columns about Presidents Richard Nixon through George W. Bush. &quot;The Pornography of Power: How Defense Hawks Hijacked 9/11 and Weakened America&quot; was published in 2008.

<text>The .40 S&amp;W (10.2×22mm) is a rimless pistol cartridge developed jointly by American firearms manufacturers Smith &amp; Wesson and Winchester in 1990. The .40 S&amp;W was developed as a law enforcement cartridge designed to duplicate performance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s (FBI) reduced-velocity 10mm Auto cartridge which could be retrofitted into medium-frame (9 mm size) semi-automatic handguns. It uses bullets ranging in weight from .

==History==

In the aftermath of the 1986 FBI Miami shootout, in which two FBI special agents were killed and five wounded, the FBI started the process of testing 9×19mm Parabellum and .45 ACP ammunition in preparation to replace its standard-issue revolver with a semi-automatic pistol. The semi-automatic pistol offered two advantages over the revolver: increased ammunition capacity and increased ease of reloading during a gunfight. The FBI was satisfied with the performance of its .38 Special +P lead semi-wadcutter hollowpoint (LSWCHP) cartridge (&quot;FBI load&quot;) based on decades of dependable performance. Ammunition for the new semi-automatic pistol had to deliver terminal performance equal or superior to the .38 Special FBI load. The FBI developed a series of practically oriented tests involving eight test events that they believed reasonably represented the kinds of situations that FBI agents commonly encountered in shooting incidents.

During tests of the 9×19mm and .45 ACP ammunition, the unit chief of the FBI Firearms Training Unit, John Hall, decided to include tests of the 10mm Auto cartridge, supplying his own Colt Delta Elite 10mm semi-automatic, and personally hand-loaded ammunition. The FBI&#x27;s tests revealed that a JHP 10mm bullet, propelled between , achieved desired terminal performance without the heavy recoil associated with conventional 10mm ammunition (). The FBI contacted Smith &amp; Wesson and requested it to design a handgun to FBI specifications, based on the existing large-frame Smith &amp; Wesson Model 4506 .45 ACP handgun, that would reliably function with the FBI&#x27;s reduced-velocity 10mm ammunition. During this collaboration with the FBI, S&amp;W realized that downsizing the 10mm full-power to meet the FBI&#x27;s medium-velocity specification meant less powder and more airspace in the case. They found that by removing the airspace they could shorten the 10mm case enough to fit within their medium-frame 9mm handguns and load it with a JHP bullet to produce ballistic performance identical to the FBI&#x27;s reduced-velocity 10mm cartridge. S&amp;W then teamed with Winchester to produce a new cartridge, the .40 S&amp;W. It uses a small pistol primer whereas the 10mm cartridge uses a large pistol primer.

The .40 S&amp;W cartridge debuted January 17, 1990, along with the new Smith &amp; Wesson Model 4006 pistol, although it was several months before the pistols were available for purchase. Austrian manufacturer Glock Ges.m.b.H. were commercially available ahead of Smith &amp; Wesson in 1990, with pistols chambered in .40 S&amp;W (the Glock 22 and Glock 23) which were announced a week before the 4006. Glock&#x27;s rapid introduction was aided by its engineering of a pistol chambered in 10mm Auto, the Glock 20, only a short time earlier. Since the .40 S&amp;W uses the same bore diameter and case head as the 10mm Auto, it was merely a matter of adapting the 10mm design to the shorter 9×19mm Parabellum frames. The new guns and ammunition were an immediate success, and pistols in the new caliber were adopted by several law enforcement agencies around the nation, including the FBI, which adopted the Glock pistol in .40 S&amp;W in May 1997.

The popularity of the .40 S&amp;W accelerated with the passage of the now-expired Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994, which prohibited sales of pistol or rifle magazines that could hold more than ten cartridges, regardless of caliber. Several U.S. states, and a number of local governments, also banned or regulated so-called &quot;high-capacity&quot; magazines. As a result, many new firearm buyers limited to purchasing pistols with a maximum magazine capacity of 10 rounds chose pistols in the .40 S&amp;W chambering instead of smaller-diameter cartridges such as the 9×19mm (9mm Luger or 9mm Parabellum).

The .40 S&amp;W case length and overall cartridge length are shortened, but other dimensions except for case web and wall thickness remain identical to the 10mm Auto. Both cartridges headspace on the mouth of the case. Thus in a semi-auto, they are not interchangeable. Fired from a 10mm semi-auto, the .40 Smith &amp; Wesson cartridge will headspace on the extractor and the bullet will jump a freebore just like a .38 Special fired from a .357 Magnum revolver. If the cartridge is not held by the extractor, the chances for a ruptured primer are great. Smith &amp; Wesson does make a double-action revolver (the Model 610) that can fire either cartridge via use of moon clips. A single-action revolver in the .38–40 chambering can also fire .40 or 10mm rounds provided it is equipped with a correctly sized cylinder. Some .40 caliber handguns can be converted to 9mm with a special purpose-made barrel, magazine change, and other parts.

In 2015, the FBI announced they were going back to 9mm ammunition, citing advancements in ballistic technology and increased accuracy in a gunfight. The FBI also found that .40 S&amp;W rounds were causing excessive wear on pistols and were harder to control for some agents. This has caused a substantial contribution to the .40 S&amp;W&#x27;s decline in popularity with law enforcement in the US.

==Cartridge dimensions==
The .40 S&amp;W has 1.25 ml (19.3 grains H2O) cartridge case capacity.

The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is , 6 grooves, ∅ lands = 9.91 ;mm, ∅ grooves = 10.17 mm, land width = 3.05 mm and the primer type is small pistol. According to the official C.I.P. guidelines, the .40 S&amp;W case can handle up to piezo pressure. In C.I.P.-regulated countries, every pistol/cartridge combo has to be proofed at 130% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers. The SAAMI pressure limit for the .40 S&amp;W is set at piezo pressure.

==Performance==
The .40 S&amp;W cartridge has been popular with law enforcement agencies in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Brazil. While possessing nearly identical accuracy, drift and drop as the 9mm Parabellum, it has an energy advantage over the 9mm Parabellum and .45 ACP, and a more manageable recoil than the 10mm Auto cartridge. Marshall &amp; Sanow (and other hydrostatic shock proponents) contend that with good jacketed hollow point bullets, the more energetic loads for the .40 S&amp;W can also create hydrostatic shock in human-sized living targets.

Based on the ideal terminal ballistic performance in ordnance gelatin during lab testing in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the .40 S&amp;W earned status as &quot;the ideal cartridge for personal defense and law enforcement&quot;. Ballistically the .40 S&amp;W is almost identical to the .38-40 Winchester introduced in 1874, as they share the same bullet diameter and bullet weight, and have similar muzzle velocities. The energy of the .40 S&amp;W exceeds standard-pressure .45 ACP loadings, generating between and of energy, depending on bullet weight. Both the .40 S&amp;W and the 9mm Parabellum operate at a SAAMI maximum, compared to a maximum for .45 ACP.

.40 S&amp;W pistols with standard (not extended) double-stack magazines can hold as many as 16 cartridges. While not displacing the 9mm Parabellum, the .40 S&amp;W is commonly used in law enforcement applications in keeping with its origin with the FBI. Select U.S. special operations units have available the .40 S&amp;W and .45 ACP for their pistols. The United States Coast Guard, having dual duties as maritime law enforcement and military deployments, has adopted the SIG Sauer P229R DAK in .40 S&amp;W as their standard sidearm. However, as of 2020, the Coast Guard has adopted the Glock 19 GEN5 MOS as its new sidearm. Numerous federal and local law enforcement agencies are currently in the process of transitioning from .40 S&amp;W to 9mm, most notably the FBI, who adopted 9mm firearms in 2015. In 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Protection adopted 9mm Glock handguns, replacing the .40 S&amp;W Heckler &amp; Koch P2000 CBP was previously using.

The .40 S&amp;W was originally loaded at subsonic velocity () with a bullet. Since its introduction, various loads have been created, with the majority being either . However, there are some bullets with weights as light as and as heavy as . Cor-Bon and Winchester both offer a JHP and Cor-Bon also offers a Barnes XPB hollow-point. Double Tap Ammo, based in Cedar City, Utah, loads a Nosler JHP, a , and Speer Gold Dot hollow-point (marketed as &quot;Bonded Defense&quot;), a Hornady XTP JHP, and three different loads included a Full Metal Jacket (FMJ), a Hornady XTP JHP and Double Tap&#x27;s own WFNGC (Wide Flat Nose Gas Check) hard cast lead bullet; the latter specifically designed for hunting and woods carry applications.
== Case failure reports in older Glock pistols ==
The .40 S&amp;W has been noted in a number of cartridge case failures involving older Glock pistols, due to the relatively large area of unsupported case head in those barrels, given its allowed chamber pressure level. The feed ramp on the Glock .40 S&amp;W pistols is larger than on other Glocks, which leaves the rear bottom of the case unsupported, and it is in this unsupported area that the cases fail. Most, but not all, of the failures have occurred with reloaded or remanufactured ammunition. Cartridges loaded at or above the SAAMI pressure, or slightly oversized cases which fire slightly out of battery are often considered to be the cause of these failures, which are commonly referred to as &quot;kaBooms&quot; or &quot;kB!&quot; for short. While these case failures do not often injure the person holding the pistol, the venting of high-pressure gas tends to eject the magazine out of the magazine well in a spectacular fashion, and usually destroys the pistol. In some cases, the barrel will also fail, blowing the top of the chamber off.

<text>May Godfrey Sutton (September 25, 1886 – October 4, 1975) was an American tennis player who was active during the first decades of the 20th century. At age 17 she won the singles title at the U.S. National Championships and in 1905 she became the first American player to win the singles title at Wimbledon.

==Biography==
May Sutton was born on September 25, 1886 in Plymouth, England, the youngest of seven children of Adolphus DeGrouchy Sutton, a captain in the Royal Navy and Adeline Esther Godfray. When she was six years old, Sutton&#x27;s family moved to a ranch near Pasadena, California. It was there that she and her sisters played tennis on a court built by her father. As young ladies, May and her sisters, Violet, Florence, and Ethel, dominated the California tennis circuit. In addition to being accomplished tennis players, the girls were excellent basketball players. May, Florence and Violet were all on the Pasadena High School basketball team, which went undefeated in 1900. In 1904 at age 17 years and 9 months, May Sutton won the singles title at the U.S. Championships on her first attempt and became the youngest US champion in history. She also teamed with Miriam Hall to win the women&#x27;s doubles title and came close to making it a clean sweep by advancing to the mixed doubles final.

She was unable to defend her U.S. title as she traveled to England in May 1905 to compete in the Wimbledon Championships. In June, she won the grass court Northern Championships in Manchester, defeating Hilda Lane in the final. Sutton became the first American and first non-British woman to win the Wimbledon singles title when she beat British star and reigning two-time Wimbledon champion Dorothea Douglass Chambers in the challenge round. She did it while shocking the British audience by rolling up her sleeves to bare her elbows and wearing a skirt that showed her ankles. For the next two years, she and Chambers met in the final, with Chambers recapturing the title in 1906 and Sutton winning it back in 1907.

Sutton was the 1908 Rose Parade Queen in Pasadena.

On December 11, 1912, she married Tom Bundy, who was a three-time winner of the men&#x27;s doubles title at the U.S. Championships, and semi-retired to raise a family. However, in 1921 at the age of 35, she made a comeback and became the fourth-ranked player in the U.S. In 1925, she was a women&#x27;s doubles finalist at the U.S. Championships and, although almost forty years of age, her game was strong enough to be selected for America&#x27;s Wightman Cup team. In 1922 and 1923, she won the women&#x27;s singles in the Ojai Tennis Tournament. She was a Wimbledon quarterfinalist in 1929 at the age of 42, which was the first time she had played Wimbledon since 1907. In 1928 and 1929, she and her daughter Dorothy Cheney became the only mother/daughter combination to be seeded at the U.S. Championships. Her nephew, John Doeg, won the U.S. Championships in 1930, and in 1938, daughter Dorothy won the Australian Championships.

In 1956, Sutton was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. She never stopped playing tennis and was playing regularly well into her late 80s.

Sutton died of cancer on October 4, 1975, in Santa Monica, California and was interred in the local Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery.

==Playing style==
Eight-time U.S. National Championship winner Molla Bjurstedt Mallory indicated that Sutton was the best player she had met. &quot;Her drive was the fastest and the...most difficult...to handle, because it dove suddenly to the ground and then jumped up unexpectedly with queer curves. When she could keep her drives near the baseline, they either forced me back farther than I had been accustomed to play or compelled me to make errors. She was also strong overhead when she came to the net and altogether had more power and effectiveness than any other woman tennis player of her time&quot;. Sutton played with an extreme Western grip and had a powerful topspin forehand that made the ball dip and bound high.

<text>Karl Klindworth (25 September 183027 July 1916) was a German composer, virtuoso pianist, conductor, violinist and music publisher. He was one of Franz Liszt&#x27;s pupils and later one of his closest disciples and friends, being also on friendly terms with composer Richard Wagner, of whom he was an admirer. 
He was highly praised by fellow musicians, including Wagner himself and Edward Dannreuther. Among his pupils were Hans von Bülow, Georgy Catoire, and Ethelbert Nevin.

==Biography==

===Family===
Klindworth was born in Hanover in 1830 as the son of Carl August Klindworth and Dorothea Wilhelmine (1800–1853), née Lamminger, daughter of court printer Johann Thomas Lamminger (1757–1805). He was the paternal nephew of diplomat and intelligence agent Georg Klindworth and clockmaker Karl Friedrich Felix Klindworth (1788–1851).

As a child, the young Klindworth received violin lessons and taught himself to play the piano. As he was not accepted as violin pupil of Louis Spohr, he then joined a traveling theater company as a successful violinist and conductor when he was only 17. In 1850, he took over the leadership of the &quot;Neue Liedertafel&quot; in Hanover. In the summer of 1852, Klindworth went to Weimar where he took piano lessons with Franz Liszt and was soon one of his closest disciples and friends. He also became on friendly terms with Richard Wagner.

===Career===
In 1854, Klindworth went to London, where he remained for fourteen years, studying, teaching and occasionally appearing in public. From London Klindworth went to Moscow in 1868, following Nikolai Rubinstein&#x27;s invitation to take up the position of professor of pianoforte at the Moscow Conservatory, where he first met Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky as professor of harmony. While in Russia, he completed his pianoforte arrangements for Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, which he had commenced during Wagner&#x27;s visit to England in 1855, Beethoven&#x27;s sonatas and also his critical edition of Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s works. He then became conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic in 1882, in association with Joseph Joachim and Franz Wüllner, being also the conductor of the Berlin Wagner Society. At this time, he established the &quot;Klindworths Musikschule&quot;, which later became the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory.

Klindworth remained in Berlin until 1893, when he retired to Potsdam, practicing as a teacher. He earned his great reputation as an editor of musical works, having re-orchestrated Chopin&#x27;s second piano concerto, adopted and raised Winifred Williams to be a perfect &quot;Wagnerite&quot; and made the orchestration of the first movement of Alkan&#x27;s solo piano concerto, the eighth of the composer&#x27;s etudes in all the minor keys, though others have since orchestrated all three movements. He died in 1916 in Stolpe, near Oranienburg, aged 85.

<doc id="528653" wikidata="Q5110023" url="?curid=528653" title="Christian Peoples Alliance">
<text>The Christian Peoples Alliance (CPA) is a minor Christian right political party in the United Kingdom. The party was founded in its present form in 1999, having grown out of a cross-party advocacy group called the Movement for Christian Democracy. The first leader of the party was Ram Gidoomal; Alan Craig took over from him in 2004 and resigned in 2012. He was replaced by Sidney Cordle, the party&#x27;s current leader.

==History==
===Movement for Christian Democracy===
The beginnings of the party can be traced to the Movement for Christian Democracy (MCD), a group founded in 1990 with the aim to combat rising secularism within the United Kingdom. The three founding members were David Alton, Derek Enright and Ken Hargreaves, who were Members of Parliament representing the Liberal Democrat, Labour and Conservative parties respectively. Though political parties with explicitly Christian aims and values had been previously established within the United Kingdom, such as the Protestant Unionist Party (PUP) in Northern Ireland, the MCD, unlike the PUP, claimed to represent both Protestants and Catholics on a nationwide, rather than regional, basis.

The MCD existed as a cross-party advocacy group and never became a political party. However, many of its members sought to form the CPA; the movement&#x27;s chairman, Alan Storkey, and its vice-chairman, David Campanale, formed the CPA in 1999 following a consultation of MCD members. In the 1997 general election Storkey stood as a Christian Democrat in Enfield Southgate.

===Formation of the Christian Peoples Alliance===
Following the devolution of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, elements of proportional representation at a local government level saw the party gain confidence. In 2000, Ram Gidoomal, a convert from Hinduism to Christianity, became the party&#x27;s leader.

Gidoomal stood for election in the 2000 London mayoral election, gaining 98,549 votes and finishing fifth, ahead of the Green Party in first preference votes. The party campaigned on job opportunities for Londoners, amongst other policies. In November that year, a candidate supported by the Christian Peoples Alliance stood at the Preston by-election, finishing seventh.

Following this, the party continued campaigning in London, mostly in working class areas, such as Canning Town in Newham. In 2002, Alan Craig became the first Christian Democrat to be elected in Britain, as a member of Newham London Borough Council.

===Craig leadership===

After the 2004 London mayoral election, Gidoomal stepped down as party leader to be succeeded by Craig. The party contested the 2005 general election with little electoral success, though a &quot;blind candidating&quot; contest run by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme saw members of the public, unaware of the party of each contestant speaking, place the party&#x27;s manifesto and policies second.

In 2006, The party won two more council seats in Canning Town. Later that year, Cardinal Keith O&#x27;Brien and Bishop Philip Tartaglia attended the party conference in Glasgow prior to the Scottish Parliament elections. Bishop Tartaglia gave a speech opening the conference in which he praised a number of party policies. In the following year, the party had two members elected at parish council level for Aston cum Aughton in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham.

In January 2008, Craig defended Anglican Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali, following his comments in the Telegraph that &quot;Islamic extremism was creating &#x27;no-go areas&#x27; for people of a different faith.&quot; Craig described the bishop as &quot;courageous&quot; for raising the matter.

As part of a party pact with the Christian Party, Craig stood for the London mayoral election in 2008 as &quot;The Christian Choice&quot;, gaining almost 3% of the vote. This was followed with 249,493 votes at the European Parliament election 2009, 1.6% of the total.

The party&#x27;s &#x27;Mayflower Declaration&#x27; laid out the party&#x27;s values and policies, voicing its opposition to the prospect of the Iraq War, deeming it &quot;illegal, unwise and immoral&quot; — a position by which it has stood.

In 2011, Craig was criticised for comparing gay rights activists to Nazis in the &quot;Church of England Newspaper&quot;.

Craig resigned as leader in October 2012; he later joined the UK Independence Party (UKIP).

===Abbey Hills Mosque===
The CPA campaigned against the building of the Abbey Mills Mosque in West Ham, planned to have been built by a sect of Islam which the CPA claimed was a &quot;radical sect&quot;. The party&#x27;s broadcast in relation to the planning was censored on both the BBC and on ITV, leading to the CPA taking unsuccessful legal action. A 23-year-old man from Stevenage posted a death threat on &quot;YouTube&quot; in response to the group&#x27;s opposition to the mosque&#x27;s construction. The party claimed the planned mosque was an &quot;unwanted landmark&quot;, stating its belief that the construction would &quot;undermine community cohesion&quot;. A petition on the official Downing Street website to prevent the mosque&#x27;s construction gained more than 255,000 signatures, claiming that the mosque would &quot;cause terrible violence&quot;.

=== Targeting of Stella Creasy ===
In November 2019, during the general election campaign, it was reported that CPA would focus on opposing Stella Creasy in her Walthamstow constituency. Creasy had that summer led successful attempts to decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland.

The CPA campaign followed another in October that year by the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform, an anti-abortion group. The CBR campaign led to police passing a file to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider whether it constituted harassment. 

The CPA came last with 0.5% of the vote.

== Organisation ==
Annual accounts submitted to the Electoral Commission show an income of £11,000 for 2013.

=== Leadership ===
=== International affiliation ===
Since 2007, the party has been affiliated to the European Christian Political Movement, an association of Christian Democrat parties, think tanks and politicians across Europe.

==Ideology==
In 2000 and 2004 in London, it put inner-city regeneration and fighting discrimination, as its top policy priorities.

The CPA has opposed the reclassification of cannabis. 

When Craig became leader he introduced policies in favour of linking Christianity to the European Union Constitution, building more church schools and supporting 5th century Christian morality. He led campaigns backing the UNISON steward at Newham Council who faced disciplinary action; against plans to build London&#x27;s large casino in Newham, against the Excel Arms Fair; against what he claims are Labour&#x27;s plans to move local families out of Canning Town in support of yuppie housing. Craig has also campaigned against proposals to demolish parts of Queen Street Market in favour of &quot;non-invasive refurbishment&quot; environment.

===Same-sex marriage===
The party was involved in the campaign against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 with its leader Sid Cordle speaking at a rally in Trafalgar Square. While the debates were taking place he spoke at a rally outside Westminster.

In May 2014, during the EU elections, under questioning from Andrew Neil on the BBC &quot;Daily Politics&quot; programme Cordle said that it was possible that recent storms in the UK could have been caused by God, saying, &quot;I think all Christians believe that God does, and can do, things with nature. A lot of Christians believe God is angry over &#x27;gay marriage&#x27; and God can show that anger if he wants to.&quot;

In May 2017, on the &quot;Daily Politics&quot; programme, Cordle was accused of &quot;embarrassing&quot; himself and was described as a &quot;bigot&quot; by the journalist Owen Jones after claiming that marriage&#x27;s sole purpose was the procreation of children. The presenter, Jo Coburn, was forced to ask Cordle to allow Jones to speak on several occasions, but Cordle accused Jones of being &quot;insulting&quot; and claimed that Coburn&#x27;s reluctance to allow him to respond to Jones was &quot;fake news&quot;.

===Economic and European policy===
The Christian Peoples Alliance rejects the class struggle doctrine and supports a mixed market economy, with an emphasis on the community, social solidarity, support for social welfare provision and some regulation of market forces. The central theme is social justice, responsible charity and an emphasis on &quot;people before profit&quot;. Within the Mayflower Declaration, the party sets out its goals and desires as providing resources to discourage economic dependency and promote gainful employment. It also supports a holistic approach to care, which moves beyond mere financial assistance, as well as help for those in danger of being pushed to the margins of society, like the homeless and disabled.

The Mayflower Declaration was updated and reprinted in early 2013 just after Cordle became leader. It now has a new introduction and at the back the policy on Europe was changed from support for the EU to &quot;while we are members of the European Union to work with fellow Christians to seek to bring about moral and democratic reform&quot;. It subsequently went further and in its 2014 European manifesto said it wanted a referendum on the EU and that if a referendum was held it would support leaving the EU.

==Election results==
The party has had candidates elected at local government elections. In Newham London Borough Council, Alan Craig was a councillor (2002-2010), as were Simeon Ademolake (2006–2010) and Denise Stafford (2006–2010). Paul Martin and David Gee were elected to Aston-cum-Aughton Parish Council (2007–2009).

The party has contested a number of seats for the UK Parliament.

===House of Commons===

The party contested nine by-elections after 2017.
===London Assembly===
The party has consistently contested elections to the London Assembly but failed to gain any seats.

<text>Henry Louis Reginald De Koven (April 3, 1859January 16, 1920) was an American music critic and prolific composer, particularly of comic operas.

==Biography==
De Koven was born in Middletown, Connecticut, and moved to Europe in 1870, where he received the majority of his education. He graduated B.A. from St John&#x27;s College, Oxford in England in 1880.

He undertook piano studies at Stuttgart Conservatory with Wilhelm Speidel, Sigmund Lebert, and Dionys Pruckner. He studied composition at Frankfurt with Johann Christian Hauff, and after staying there for six months moved on to Florence, Italy, where he studied singing with Luigi Vanuccini. Study in operatic composition followed, first with Richard Genée in Vienna and then with Léo Delibes in Paris.

De Koven returned to the U.S. in 1882 to live in Chicago, Illinois, and later lived in New York City. He was able to find scope for his wide musical knowledge as a critic with Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Evening Post&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; and &quot;New York World&quot;. Many of his songs became popular, especially &quot;Oh Promise Me&quot;, with words by Clement Scott, which was one of the biggest song successes of its time and remains a wedding standard.

Between 1887 and 1913, De Koven composed 20 light operas, in addition to hundreds of songs, orchestral works, sonatas and ballets. While Victor Herbert&#x27;s operettas were heavily influenced by those of continental operetta composers, De Koven&#x27;s works were patterned after Gilbert and Sullivan. His greatest success was &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, which premiered in Chicago in 1890 but was performed all across the country. It played in New York at the Knickerbocker Theatre and in London, in 1891, and at New York&#x27;s Garden Theatre in 1892, and it continued to be revived for many years. His other operettas included &quot;The Fencing Master&quot; (1892, Casino Theatre, New York); &quot;Rob Roy&quot;, first produced in Detroit, Michigan, 1894; &quot;The Highwayman&quot; (1897, Herald Square Theatre, New York); &quot;The Little Duchess&quot; (1901, Casino Theatre, New York); and &quot;The Beauty Spot&quot; (1909, Herald Square Theatre).

From 1902 to 1904, De Koven conducted the Washington, D.C., symphony. His wife, Anna de Koven, was a well-known socialite, novelist and amateur historian who published her works under the name &quot;Mrs. Reginald de Koven.&quot; The music press doubted that De Koven could compose serious operas. His opera &quot;The Canterbury Pilgrims&quot; (with a libretto by poet and dramatist Percy MacKaye) premiered at the Metropolitan Opera in 1917. He composed a second opera, &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; (also with a libretto by MacKaye), but died before it was performed in 1920 in Chicago.

One obituary asserted that he proved that &quot;the American stage was not dependent upon foreign composers.&quot;

<text>The Apollo Lyceus (, &quot;Apollōn Lukeios&quot;) type, also known as Lycean Apollo, originating with Praxiteles and known from many full-size statue and figurine copies as well as from 1st century BCE Athenian coinage, is a statue type of Apollo showing the god resting on a support (a tree trunk or tripod), his right forearm touching the top of his head and his hair fixed in braids on the top of a head in a haircut typical of childhood. It is called &quot;Lycean&quot; not after Lycia itself, but after its identification with a lost work described, though not attributed to a sculptor, by Lucian as being on show in the Lyceum, one of the gymnasia of Athens. According to Lucian, the god leaning on a support with his bow in his left hand and his right resting on his head is shown &quot;as if resting after long effort.&quot; Its main exemplar is the &quot;Apollino&quot; in Florence or &quot;Apollo Medici&quot;, in the Uffizi, Florence.

The attribution, based on the type&#x27;s &quot;elongated proportions, elegant pose and somewhat effeminate anatomy&quot;, as Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway characterised it, is traditionally supported on the grounds of the type&#x27;s similarity to Praxiteles&#x27;s &quot;Hermes&quot; from Olympia - one replica of the &quot;Lycian Apollo&quot; even passed as a copy of the &quot;Hermes&quot; for a time. The comparison essentially rests on the &quot;Apollino&quot;, whose head has proportions similar to those of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and whose pronounced &quot;sfumato&quot; confirms the long-held idea that it is Praxitelean in style, in spite of the many differences among the extant examples.

Nevertheless, most exemplars of this type exhibit a pronounced musculature which does not resemble masculine types normally attributed to Praxiteles - it has further been proposed that it is a work of his contemporary Euphranor, or of a 2nd-century BCE work The &quot;Apollino&quot;, for its part, would thus be an eclectic creation from the Roman era, mixing several styles from the &quot;second classicism&quot; (i.e. from the 4th century BC).

The famous pose with the arm resting on the head was so thoroughly identified with Apollo that it was used for the Hadrianic sculpture of Antinous as Apollo at Leptis Magna. With the Hellenistic and Roman depictions of a youthful Dionysus typologically not always distinguishable from Apollo, the pose seems to have been inherited by Dionysus, as in the 2nd century CE Ludovisi Dionysus, a Roman sculpture. The pose is also used in the Amazon statue types, and its long-established conventional expression of lassitude identified Sleeping Ariadne as well.
