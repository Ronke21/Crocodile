<text>The Efficeon (stylized as efficēon) processor is Transmeta&#x27;s second-generation 256-bit VLIW design released in 2004 which employs a software engine Code Morphing Software (CMS) to convert code written for x86 processors to the native instruction set of the chip. Like its predecessor, the Transmeta Crusoe (a 128-bit VLIW architecture), Efficeon stresses computational efficiency, low power consumption, and a low thermal footprint.

==Processor==
Efficeon most closely mirrors the feature set of Intel Pentium 4 processors, although, like AMD Opteron processors, it supports a fully integrated memory controller, a HyperTransport IO bus, and the NX bit, or no-execute x86 extension to PAE mode. NX bit support is available starting with CMS version 6.0.4.

Efficeon&#x27;s computational performance relative to mobile CPUs like the Intel Pentium M is thought to be lower, although little appears to be published about the relative performance of these competing processors.

Efficeon came in two package types: a 783- and a 592-contact ball grid array (BGA). Its power consumption is moderate (with some consuming as little as 3 watts at 1 GHz and 7 watts at 1.5 GHz), so it can be passively cooled.

Two generations of this chip were produced. The first generation (TM8600) was manufactured using a TSMC 0.13 micrometre process and produced at speeds up to 1.2 GHz. The second generation (TM8800 and TM8820) was manufactured using a Fujitsu 90 nm process and produced at speeds ranging from 1 GHz to 1.7 GHz.

Internally, the Efficeon has two arithmetic logic units, two load/store/add units, two execute units, two floating-point/MMX/SSE/SSE2 units, one branch prediction unit, one alias unit, and one control unit. The VLIW core can execute a 256-bit VLIW instruction per cycle, which is called a molecule, and has room to store eight 32-bit instructions (called atoms) per cycle.

The Efficeon has a 128 KB L1 instruction cache, a 64 KB L1 data cache and a 1 MB L2 cache. All caches are on die.

Additionally, the Efficeon CMS (code morphing software) reserves a small portion of main memory (typically 32 MB) for its translation cache of dynamically translated x86 instructions.

<text>The Royal Society of Literature (RSL) is a learned society founded in 1820 by King George IV to &quot;reward literary merit and excite literary talent&quot;. A charity that represents the voice of literature in the UK, the RSL has about 800 Fellows, elected from among the best writers in any genre currently at work. Additionally, Honorary Fellows are chosen from those who have made a significant contribution to the advancement of literature, including publishers, agents, librarians, booksellers or producers. The society is a cultural tenant at London&#x27;s Somerset House. The RSL is an independent charity and relies on the support of its Members, Patrons, Fellows and friends to continue its work.

==History==

The Royal Society of Literature (RSL) was founded in 1820, with the patronage of George IV, to &quot;reward literary merit and excite literary talent&quot;, and its first president was Thomas Burgess, Bishop of St David&#x27;s (who was later translated as Bishop of Salisbury). From the beginning of the 21st century, Presidents have served four year terms and the RSL has employed a professional director to oversee its membership and outreach programmes. From 2018, the RSL&#x27;s patron has been Queen Camilla, who took over in the role from Elizabeth II. 

=== Fellowship ===

Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature: are elected annually and accorded the privilege of using the post-nominal letters FRSL. Traditionally around 14 new fellows per year were elected, with a total number of about 500 being maintained. To be nominated for fellowship, a writer must have published two works of literary merit, and nominations must be seconded by an RSL fellow. All nominations are presented to members of the Council of the Royal Society of Literature, who vote biannually to elect new fellows. Newly elected fellows are introduced at the Society&#x27;s annual general meeting and summer party. While the President reads a citation for each, they are invited to sign their names in the roll book which dates back to 1820, Additionally, Honorary Fellows are chosen from those who have made a significant contribution to the advancement of literature, including publishers, agents, librarians, booksellers or producers, or who have rendered special service to the RSL. 

Past fellows include Samuel Taylor Coleridge, J. R. R. Tolkien, W. B. Yeats, Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy, George Bernard Shaw, Arthur Koestler, Chinua Achebe, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, Robert Ardrey, Sybille Bedford, Muriel Spark, P. J. Kavanagh, Hilary Mantel, and Sir Roger Scruton. Present Fellows include Margaret Atwood, Bernardine Evaristo, David Hare, Kazuo Ishiguro, Andrew Motion, Paul Muldoon, Zadie Smith, Nadeem Aslam, Sarah Waters,J. K. Rowling, and Nick Cave. A newly created fellow inscribes his or her name on the society&#x27;s official roll using either Byron&#x27;s pen, T. S. Eliot&#x27;s fountain pen, which replaced Dickens&#x27;s quill in 2013, or (as of 2018) George Eliot&#x27;s pen, with pens belonging to Jean Rhys and Andrea Levy being additional choices from 2020.

In 2018, the RSL launched the initiative &quot;40 Under 40&quot;, which saw the election of 40 new fellows aged under 40. In 2020, the RSL celebrated its 200th anniversary with the announcement of RSL 200, &quot;a five-year festival launched with a series of major new initiatives and 60 new appointments championing the great diversity of writing and writers in the UK&quot;. Initiatives included RSL Open (electing new Fellows from communities, backgrounds and experiences currently under-represented in UK literary culture), and RSL International Writers (recognising the contribution of writers across the globe to literature in English). RSL 200 resulted in more than 60 new fellows and honorary fellows being elected annually between 2021 and 2024. There are now more than 800 FRSLs. 

From 2023, the RSL began to be criticized over the new diversity of fellowship and for not taking a strong enough stance about the stabbing of Salman Rushdie and the cancellation of Kate Clanchy. In February 2024, President Bernardine Evaristo defended the RSL in &quot;The Guardian&quot; over the changes to fellowship and issues of freedom of speech, and stated that the RSL &quot;cannot take sides in writers&#x27; controversies and issues, but must remain impartial.&quot; In reply, Rushdie commented on X: &quot;Just wondering if the Royal Society of Literature is &#x27;impartial&#x27; about attempted murder?&quot; Publication of the RSL&#x27;s annual magazine was delayed in connection with an article mentioning Israel. In February 2024 the RSL referred itself to the Charity Commission in response to what it described as a &quot;sustained campaign of misinformation being made against it&quot;.

In January 2025, Director Molly Rosenberg and Chair Daljit Nagra stepped down from their positions, and, following an annual general meeting, it was announced that the RSL would be implementing a governance review under the new leadership of Ruth Scurr.

=== Publications ===
The society publishes an annual magazine, the &quot;RSL Review&quot;, which includes features, interviews and essays. 

In 2000, the RSL published a volume that provides a description and history of the society, written by one of its fellows, Isabel Quigly.

=== Membership ===
From 2012, the RSL established a membership programme offering a variety of events to members and the general public. Membership of the RSL is open to all.

=== Outreach ===
In 2021, the RSL launched &quot;Literature Matters: Reading Together&quot;, a project aiming to make recreational reading accessible to young people across the UK.

== Awards and prizes ==
Through its prize programmes, the RSL supports new and established contemporary writers.

* The RSL Christopher Bland Prize — £10,000 for debut prose writers aged 50 or over.

<text>John Coprario ( – ), also known as Giovanni Coprario or Coperario, was an English composer, viol player and teacher.

==Life and career==
According to later commentators, such as John Playford and Roger North, he changed his name from either Cowper or Cooper to Coperario in the early 17th century (at least as early as February 1601), although he himself spelled his name &quot;John Coprario&quot;. Anthony Wood said he changed his name after an extended visit to Italy, and though he is documented as having visited the Low Countries in 1603, evidence confirming his presence in Italy has not been found. From 1622 he served and may have taught the Prince of Wales, for whom he continued to work upon his accession as Charles I. His longtime patron was Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, for whom, according to Thomas Fuller&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Worthies of England&quot; (1662), he taught William Lawes.

Among Coprario&#x27;s works are fantasias, suites, and other works for viols and violins, and two collections of songs, &quot;Funeral Teares&quot; (1606) and &quot;Songs of Mourning: Bewailing the Untimely Death of Prince Henry&quot; (1613). Coprario wrote songs for &quot;The Somerset Masque&quot; performed on 26 December 1613. He also penned a treatise on composition, &quot;Rules how to Compose&quot; ().

According to Ernst Meyer, Coprario was a Londoner who Italianized his name as Italian music and musicians became more fashionable, and spent much of his life as a musician in the royal court.

Ninety-six fantasias for three up to six voices, most of them in two Oxford and Royal College of Music collections, were known to exist by Coprario (as of 1946). Meyer also notes that most of Coprario&#x27;s five- and six-part fantasias are mainly transcriptions, or imitations, of his madrigals, but that his fantasias for three or four instrumental parts are, formally especially, independently interesting.

<doc id="526440" wikidata="Q29952" url="?curid=526440" title="Erzya language">
<text>The Erzya language (, , ), also Erzian or historically Arisa, is spoken by approximately 300,000 people in the northern, eastern and north-western parts of the Republic of Mordovia and adjacent regions of Nizhny Novgorod, Chuvashia, Penza, Samara, Saratov, Orenburg, Ulyanovsk, Tatarstan and Bashkortostan in Russia. A diaspora can also be found in Armenia and Estonia, as well as in Kazakhstan and other states of Central Asia. Erzya is currently written using Cyrillic with no modifications to the variant used by the Russian language. In Mordovia, Erzya is co-official with Moksha and Russian.

The language belongs to the Mordvinic branch of the Uralic languages. Erzya is a language that is closely related to Moksha but has distinct phonetics, morphology and vocabulary.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
The following table lists the consonant phonemes of Erzya together with their Cyrillic equivalents.

Palatalization is widespread in Erzya, but is contrastive only for the alveolar consonants. The labial and velar consonants have palatalized allophones before the front vowels , . The pairs – , – and – also often alternate depending on a following or preceding back vs. front vowel. E.g. the 1st person singular possessive suffix has allomorphs such as and . The palatalized consonants can natively occur also in a back vowel environment, e.g. the genitive suffix , providing minimal pairs such as &#x27;my house&#x27; – &#x27;(a) house&#x27;s&#x27;. Non-palatalized , , in a front vowel environment are limited to recent Russian loans such as &#x27;whale&#x27;.

Note on romanized transcription: in Uralic studies, the members of the palatalized series are usually spelled as , , , , , , , , while the postalveolar sounds are spelled , , (see Uralic Phonetic Alphabet).

 and are loan phonemes from Russian. There is a phonemic contrast between and , despite that they share the standard spelling ⟨н⟩. Minimal pairs include:
* &quot;along the path&quot;, in which the alveolar of the stem is retained before the prolative case ending , vs. , the connegative form of the verb &quot;to break&quot;
* &quot;good&quot;, subject or object complement in translative, vs. &quot;direction; area&quot;. See Rueter 2010: 58.

=== Vowels ===
Erzya has a simple five-vowel system.

The front vowels and have centralized variants and immediately following a plain alveolar consonant, e.g. &quot;they&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;.

=== Vowel harmony ===
As in many other Uralic languages, Erzya has vowel harmony. Most roots contain either front vowels (, ) or back vowels (, ). In addition, all suffixes with mid vowels have two forms: the form to be used is determined by the final syllable of the stem. The low vowel (), found in the comparative case () &quot;the size of&quot; and the prolative () &quot;spatial multipoint used with verbs of motion as well as position&quot; is a back vowel and not subject to vowel harmony.

The rules of vowel harmony are as follows:

# If the final syllable of the word stem contains a front vowel, the front form of the suffix is used: () &quot;village&quot;, () &quot;in a village&quot;
# If the final syllable of the word stem contains a back vowel, and it is followed by plain (non-palatalized) consonants, the back form of the suffix is used: () &quot;house&quot;, () &quot;in a house&quot;

However, if the back vowel is followed by a palatalized consonant or palatal glide, vowel harmony is violated and the &quot;front&quot; form of the suffix is used: () &quot;with willow&quot;, () &quot;with butter&quot;. Likewise, if a front-vowel stem is followed by a low back vowel suffix, subsequent syllables will contain back harmony: () &quot;throughout its villages&quot;

Thus the seeming violations of vowel harmony attested in stems, e.g. () &quot;axe&quot;, () &quot;thread (string)&quot;, are actually due to the palatalized consonants and .

One exception to front-vowel harmony is observed in palatalized non-final , e.g. () &quot;with asphalt&quot;.

== Writing ==
===Cyrillic alphabet===
The modern Erzya alphabet is the same as for Russian:

The letters ф, х, щ and ъ are only used in loanwords from Russian. The pre-1929 version of the Erzya alphabet included the additional letter Cyrillic ligature En Ge (Ҥ ҥ) in some publications, (cf. Evsevyev 1928).

In combination with the alveolar consonants т, д, ц, с, з, н, л, and р, vowel letters are employed to distinguish between plain and palatalized articulations in a similar way as in Russian: а, э, ы, о, у follow plain alveolars, while я, е, и, ё, ю follow palatalized alveolars, e.g. та /ta/, тэ /te/, ты /ti/, то /to/, ту /tu/ vs. тя /tʲa/, те /tʲe/, ти /tʲi/, тё /tʲo/, тю /tʲu/. If no vowel follows, palatalization is indicated by ь, e.g. ть /tʲ/. Following non-alveolar consonants, only а, е, и, о, у occur, e.g. па /pa/, пе /pe/, пи /pi/, по /po/, пу /pu/.

===Latin alphabet===

A Latin alphabet was officially approved by the government of Nizhne-Volzhskiy Kray in 1932, but it was never used:
::::a в c ç d ә e f g y i j k l m n o p r s ş t u v x z ƶ ь

One of the modern Latin alphabet proposals:
::::a b c č ć d d́/ď e f g h i j k l ĺ/ľ m n ń o p r ŕ s š ś t t́/ť u v z ž ź

== Morphology ==
Like all other Uralic languages, Erzya is an agglutinative language which expresses grammatical relations by means of suffixes.

=== Nouns ===
Nouns are inflected for case, number, definiteness and possessor. Erzya distinguishes twelve cases (here illustrated with the noun &quot;ground, earth&quot;). Number is systematically distinguished only with definite nouns; for indefinite nouns and nouns with a possessive suffix, only the nominative case has a distinct plural.

Plural possessors follow the pattern of second person singular possessors.

=== Verbs ===
Erzya verbs are inflected for tense and mood, and are further conjugated for person of subject and object. Traditionally, three stem types are distinguished: &quot;a&quot;-stems, &quot;o&quot;-stems and &quot;e&quot;-stems. &quot;A&quot;-stems always retain the stem vowel &quot;a&quot; in the non-third-person present-tense forms, and in the third-person first past-tense forms (e.g. &quot;kissed&quot;). With many &quot;o&quot;-stems and &quot;e&quot;-stems, the stem vowel is dropped in these forms (e.g. &quot;o&quot;-stem &quot;watched&quot;, &quot;e&quot;-stem &quot;swallowed&quot;), but there also &quot;o&quot;- and &quot;e&quot;-stem verbs which retain the vowel ( &quot;slept&quot;, &quot;cooked&quot;). Rueter (2010) therefore divides verb stems into vowel-retaining stems and vowel-dropping stems.

In indicative mood, three tenses are distinguished: present/future, first past, second (=habitual) past.

The third-person singular form in the present tense is also used as present participle. The second past tense is formed by adding the past-tense copula to the present participle.

The other mood categories are:
*conditional ( + present suffixes)
*conjunctive ( + past suffixes)
*conditional-conjunctive ( + past suffixes)
*desiderative ( + past suffixes)
*optative ( + present suffixes)
*imperative ()

<text>The Hummingbirds were an Australian indie pop and jangle pop band from Sydney, who formed in 1986 from Bug Eyed Monsters. They were one of the most highly regarded outfits to emerge from Sydney&#x27;s inner-city scene during the late 1980s and were an early signing to the rooArt label. The Hummingbirds&#x27; single &quot;Blush&quot; peaked at No.19 on the ARIA singles charts in 1989. They left rooArt in 1992, and disbanded in 1993.

==Biography==
The Hummingbirds formed in 1986 from the remnants of the short lived band Bug Eyed Monsters. Band members originally comprised singer and guitarist Simon Holmes, bassist John Boyce and drummer Mark Temple, after a few months of initial rehearsals as a three-piece, vocalist and guitarist Alannah Russack signed on. In early 1987, Boyce departed and was replaced by singer and bassist Robyn St. Clare. They were one of Australia&#x27;s most promising acts in the late 1980s and early 1990s, along with other up-and-comers like Ratcat, Clouds, Tall Tales and True and The Falling Joys.

They debuted in July 1987, with the single &quot;Alimony&quot;, it was followed by three more singles, &quot;Get On Down&quot;/&quot;Everything You Said&quot; in January 1988, &quot;Swim to Shore&quot; in July and &quot;Hindsight&quot; in November. All four singles were released on the independent label, Phantom Records. All four singles were also re-issued by Phantom Records under the title &quot;Quatro&quot; in 1989.

The Hummingbirds signed to rooART in early 1989. They released their single &quot;Blush&quot; that August and it reached number one on the alternative music chart, and No.19 on the ARIA singles charts. Their first album, &quot;loveBUZZ&quot;, produced by Mitch Easter, was released in 1989. and peaked at No.31 on the ARIA album charts. It earned an American release, though sales were slow despite excellent reviews. In December 1989, Nic Dalton (The Plunderers) filled in on bass guitar as St. Clare, the regular bassist, took leave due to illness. Dalton left to join US alternative rock band The Lemonheads, The Hummingbirds had played support to The Lemonheads 1991 tour of Australia. Greg Atkinson, from the Ups and Downs and Big Heavy Stuff, also filled in on bass during 1991.

The Hummingbirds continued recording, releasing another album produced by Easter, April 1991&#x27;s &quot;Va Va Voom&quot;, which peaked at No.44 on the ARIA album charts. However, its release was delayed due to problems with RooArt. They were freed from their contract after the May 1992 release, &quot;You Just Gotta Know My Mind&quot;, with Dalton again deputising for St. Clare – who was pregnant with her and Holmes&#x27; son Milo.

In 1993, The Hummingbirds made two EPs on the small independent label IV Recordings, &quot;Gone&quot;, (in February) and, &quot;Tail&quot;, (in July). The band found it hard to justify their move from a major label like rooART to the smaller IV Recordings, and broke up after the release of &quot;Tail&quot;. They played their final show on 11 December 1993, at the Central Club Hotel in (Richmond) Melbourne, featuring Holmes, Russack, St. Clare and Melder.

==Post break-up==
Simon Holmes joined Her Name in Lights, which issued their debut album, &quot;Into the Light Again&quot; in October 2004. He then went on to record other albums with a new band, Fragile. Alannah Russack played in Sydney as a solo artist. Robyn St. Clare, whose composition &quot;Into Your Arms&quot; was a hit for The Lemonheads, has recorded with Ratcat. Mark Temple earned a PhD from the University of New South Wales, and now is a Senior Lecturer in Molecular Biology at Western Sydney University.

==Reunions==
After 17 years, the band reformed for a reunion on 27 January 2011, for the Big Day Out festival in Sydney. The line-up featured Holmes, Temple and Russack, with St. Clare replaced on bass.
The band followed the Big Day Out reunion show with some additional performances later that year;
Thursday 7 July 2011 – Simon Holmes and Alannah Russack (acoustic performance), Union Hotel, Newtown.
Saturday 17 September 2011 – full band at the Manning Bar, Sydney University.
The day before the show at the Manning Bar, the band played a short set for &quot;Live at the Loft&quot; on 2SER radio and were also interviewed by DJ Andrew Khedoori. The line-up featured Holmes, Temple, Russack and Danny Yau on bass.

Along with The Falling Joys, the band reunited to play two shows on the 2nd and 3rd (matinee show) of July 2016 at the Newtown Social Club in Sydney (previously known as the Sandringham Hotel, Newtown). The line-up featured Holmes, Temple, Russack and Danny Yau again on bass.

The band played as part of a tribute concert to The Cure, celebrating the 25th anniversary of the release of The Cure album &quot;Wish&quot;. The gig took place at the Factory Theatre in Marrickville, Sydney, on 15 April 2017. This was the final concert of The Hummingbirds.

Simon Holmes died in Sydney in July 2017, at the age of 54. A tribute night featuring many bands was held for Simon Holmes on 3 December at the Factory Theater in Sydney. As part of the tribute night a limited edition, self-titled vinyl LP was released, combining all of the tracks from the band&#x27;s last two EP&#x27;s &#x27;Gone&#x27; and &#x27;Tail&#x27;, which were originally released only on CD in 1993.

<doc id="526454" wikidata="Q352185" url="?curid=526454" title="Sol Hoʻopiʻi">
<text>Solomon Hoʻopiʻi Kaʻaiʻai ( ; 1902 – November 16, 1953) was a Native Hawaiian lap steel guitarist. A virtuoso, he was one of the most famous original Hawaiian steel guitarists, along with Joseph Kekuku, Frank Ferera, Sam Ku West and &quot;King&quot; Bennie Nawahi.

==Early life==
He was born Solomon Hoʻopiʻi Kaʻaiʻai in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1902 into a large family – his birth making him the 21st child in the family.

Sol&#x27;s family taught him to sing and play instruments by the time he could walk. He was playing the ukulele by age three. By his teenage years the Hawaiian steel guitar had become his instrument of choice.

He made his debut with Johnny Noble and his Orchestra. According to the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame, at age 17 Sol and two teenage friends stowed away on the ocean liner &quot;Matsonia&quot;. They were discovered by passengers who were so charmed by their musical performances that the other passengers took up a collection to pay their fares. They landed in San Francisco, played a few club engagements, and eventually made their way to Los Angeles at the behest of Hoot Gibson to play in his country music band. Sol&#x27;s friends returned to Hawaii, and Sol formed a trio with new associates.

==Sol Hoʻopiʻi Trio==
By 1924, Hoʻopiʻi had moved to Los Angeles, where he formed the Sol Hoʻopiʻi Trio, with Glenwood Leslie and Lani McIntyre, including sometimes additional musicians, and he successfully performed in the local and then very popular Polynesian-themed night venues. His first recordings in 1925–28 featured often jazzy improvisation.

He recorded his best known material 1933 to 1938, as Sol Hoopii&#x27;s Novelty Trio, Novelty Quartette and Novelty Five on Decca Records and Brunswick Records labels, like the famous &quot;Hula Girl&quot;, &quot;Ten Tiny Toes&quot;, and many more brilliant Hawaiian hula and hapa-haole songs penned by the best Hawaiian composers like Johnny Noble and Sol Bright.

Originally favouring the acoustic lap steel guitar, he switched to electric lap steel only around 1935 and developed an original tuning, in addition to the open A or open G tunings commonly in use at the time.

He very often applied bluesy and jazzy treatments to the Tin Pan Alley standards, as well as to Hawaiian classics. His peculiar rhythmic, harmonic and melodic techniques influenced not only Hawaiian-styled musicians but also famed country and western swing steel guitarists, like Joaquin Murphy and Jerry Byrd.

==Christian ministry==
In 1938, Hoʻopiʻi gave up his secular career to join the evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson, writing and performing songs for her tours. A rare video exists of Hoʻopiʻi playing traditional hymns on his lap steel guitar, accompanied by Christian composer Phillip Stanley Kerr on the piano.

Kerr mis-pronounces Sol&#x27;s name as &quot;hope-y&quot;. (Prior to, and for years after Hawaii&#x27;s statehood, many Americans mis-pronounced the state&#x27;s name as How-Wah-Yah, leading to show biz jokes about the 50th state of &quot;How Are Ya?&quot; )

Titled &quot;Musical Moments with Sol Hoʻopiʻi and His Hawaiian Guitar&quot;, part of &quot;The Scriptures Visualized&quot; series, this was produced in 1942 by C.O. Baptista Films of Chicago. Part 2 of the video begins with Phil Kerr and Sol Hoʻopiʻi testifying about Hoʻopiʻi&#x27;s Christian conversion, and contains a rare moment of Hoʻopiʻi doing a falsetto rendition of Kerr&#x27;s composition &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with the Lover of my Soul&quot;.

==Steel guitar history==
Some historians credit Joseph Kekuku with inventing the Hawaiian steel guitar about 1889 from an acoustic Spanish guitar. This was long before Hoʻopiʻi&#x27;s time.
As far as the electrified lap steel, Philip Kerr mentions in the 1942 Baptista video that Hoʻopiʻi &quot;was the originator of this electric guitar that he&#x27;s playing.&quot; Hoʻopiʻi himself does not make that claim on camera and Kerr may have been saying that Hoʻopiʻi designed or made that particular guitar in his possession. However, the claim comes up again in 1950, in a Florida Newspaper announcing, &quot;Sol Hoopii, king of the Hawaiian guitar and originator of the electric guitar...&quot; as part of the entertainment line-up for a church anniversary. The electric lap steel guitar, in fact, was not invented by Hoʻopiʻi, but he was acquainted with its inventor, George Beauchamp, in Los Angeles. Beauchamp was a steel player who collaborated with violin repairman John Dopyera to attempt to build a steel guitar that was louder. Dopyera and Beauchamp developed a non-electric guitar prototype with a metal resonator, a large metal cone placed under the guitar bridge. They sought investors for a new company to manufacture and sell the resonator guitar. To promote their invention, they organized a lavish party hosted by millionaire Ted Kleinmeyer and asked Sol Hoʻopiʻi to demonstrate the instrument. Years later, after splitting with Dopyera, Beauchamp independently invented the first electric guitar (a lap steel), and received the patent on August 10, 1937.

==Final days and death==
For the last few years of his life Hoʻopiʻi was blind, but he continued to play, compose, and teach. Solomon Hoʻopiʻi Kaʻaiʻai died November 16, 1953. His place of death has been listed alternately as Los Angeles, California, or Seattle, Washington.

Bud Tutmarc, a Christian Hawaiian steel guitar player based in Seattle, was a close personal friend of Sol&#x27;s and stated that Sol died in Seattle. On May 27, 1953, only 6 months before Sol&#x27;s death, the two friends recorded a live Seattle performance of &quot;Indiana March&quot; (Sol on steel guitar); a three-in-one gospel medley (Sol and Bud steel guitar duet) – &quot;Mansion Over the Hilltop&quot;, &quot;It Is No Secret&quot; and &quot;Aloha Oe&quot;; a medley of &quot;At Calvary&quot; and &quot;Power In The Blood&quot; (Sol solo ukulele instrumental); and &quot;I&#x27;ll Go With Him&quot; (ukulele and Sol vocals).

Tutmarc died December 4, 2006, and his web site photo page has a snapshot of Sol and Bud having what looks like a one-on-one jam session. (photo #6 of the &quot;Middle Years&quot; gallery)

Steel guitarist George de Fretes, who died in 1981, considered Hoʻopiʻi to be his idol, and is buried next to him.

==In popular culture==
The Sol Hoʻopiʻi Trio appears as a house band wearing &quot;...pink shirts and matching trousers, with red cummerbunds and leis...&quot; in the 1998 novel &quot;Damned in Paradise&quot;.

Sol Hoʻopiʻi&#x27;s guitar and memorabilia make an appearance in the 2004 novel &quot;The Celestial Jukebox&quot;.

Garrison Keillor does a brief tip of the hat to &quot;Sol Hoʻopiʻi and his Royal Hawaiians&quot; in his 2004 novel &quot;Love Me&quot;.

Author Simon Leng likens George Harrison&#x27;s slide guitar work with the Traveling Wilburys to &quot;a 1990s Sol Hoʻopiʻi&quot; in his 2006 book on the works of the British legend.

==Awards==
In 1996, Hoʻopiʻi became an honoree in the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame.

The Steel Guitar Hall of Fame inducted Hoʻopiʻi in 1979.

In 2012 Hoʻopiʻi&#x27;s recording of the Gershwin standard &quot;Fascinating Rhythm&quot; was added to the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Registry list of sound recordings that &quot;are culturally, historically, or aesthetically important, and/or inform or reflect life in the United States.&quot;

==Soundtracks==
Hoʻopiʻi performed in a number of Hollywood &quot;jazz&quot; movies like &quot;His Jazz Bride&quot;, and later he was involved in the exotic movies craze, appearing notably in &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot;, &quot;Waikiki Wedding&quot;, and even some Charlie Chan mystery movies. He also performed in the soundtrack for the Betty Boop cartoon &quot;Betty Boop&#x27;s Bamboo Isle&quot;.

<text>NYNEX Corporation was an American telephone company that served five states of New England (Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont) as well as most of the state of New York from January 1, 1984 to August 14, 1997.

==History==
Formed on January 1, 1984 as the result of the breakup of the Bell System, NYNEX was a Regional Bell Operating Company which was made up of former subsidiaries of AT&amp;T, these being New York Telephone and New England Telephone. The name NYNEX was an acronym for New York New England Exchange. Delbert C. Staley, chairman of the New York Telephone Company, was named as the new company&#x27;s first chairman before NYNEX officially went into business. He was replaced by William C. Ferguson, president and chief operating officer of the New York Telephone Company, when the new company launched. 

In April 1986, NYNEX purchased all 84 IBM Product Centers and relaunched them, along with its 19 Datago stores, as NYNEX Business Centers.

In June 1988, NYNEX acquired AGS Computers Inc., a professional services and software provider. AGS was then run as an independent subsidiary. NYNEX expanded into commercial real estate with its NYNEX Properties Company subsidiary. By July 1988, NYNEX owned buildings in Westchester County and Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey, with plans to lease space to outside tenants. 

In August 1989, 200,000 telephone workers in 20 states went on strike against NYNEX, Pacific Telesis, Bell Atlantic, and Ameritech. While most of the walkouts were eventually settled, NYNEX did not agree to a new contract until November. During the 100-day strike, workers were accused of vandalism, one picketer died, and landline installations were delayed for months. 

In February 1990, the FCC ordered the company to pay $1.4 million in fines and refund $35 million to consumers for an illegal scheme to funnel profits to NYNEX Material Enterprises by overcharging regulated companies for basic supplies and awarding bloated contracts to vendors who attended company parties. NYNEX dismissed two executives and disciplined several other employees of the subsidiary in the summer of 1988.

By 1993, NYNEX had decided to leave the information services business, selling AGS to Keane in November. The sale included AGS Information Services, Atkinson Tremblay &amp; Associates Inc., AGS Federal Systems Inc. and AGS Management Systems Inc., but not Disc Inc. and Stockholder Systems Inc., or NYNEX DPI. During this time, the company also sold the London-based BIS Group and Systems Strategies Inc.

In 1994, NYNEX pledged to cut 16,800 employees, or 22 percent of its payroll, by the end of 1996. It planned to work with the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers to find solutions that avoided sweeping layoffs. This continued a previous trend, where the company cut 13,000 jobs over the previous four years through voluntary departures. In February 1994, vice chairman Ivan Seidenberg was named as the company&#x27;s new president and chief operating officer. In November, he was named chairman and chief executive. NYNEX DPI was sold to IBM in September 1994. Amidst a flurry of legal challenges brought by various regional Bell companies against regulators that year, it was ruled that NYNEX would be permitted to offer television programming over its local networks. 

In May 1995, New York State agreed to deregulate NYNEX&#x27;s pricing structure in order to allow the company to offer more competitive pricing. As part of the deal, NYNEX agreed to cut $375 million in its residential and business phone rates in New York by 1999. 

===International assets===
Looking to expand into international markets by the 1990s, NYNEX set up operations in Brussels, Gibraltar, Philippines, and Britain. In March 1993, NYNEX Cablecomms of Britain purchased Pactel Cable U.K. Ltd from Pacific Telesis. 

NYNEX also operated cable television and telephone services in the United Kingdom with offices in Waterlooville (Hampshire), Baguley (Manchester), Shoreham-by-Sea (West Sussex), Leatherhead (Surrey) and Antrim (Northern Ireland).

NYNEX Cablecomms announced its initial public offering in June 1995. In 1996, NYNEX&#x27;s UK assets were merged with the subsidiary of Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury Communications, as well as cable operators Vidéotron and Bell Cablemedia, and the new business was subsequently renamed Cable &amp; Wireless Communications.

Cable &amp; Wireless’ cable assets were sold to NTL in July 1999. The acquisition was completed in May 2000. NTL then merged with Telewest in March 2006 to form NTL:Telewest, and was later rebranded on February 8, 2007 as Virgin Media.

===Merger with Bell Atlantic===

In April 1996, after two years of negotiations, NYNEX and Bell Atlantic announced its intentions to merge. Under the terms of the deal, Raymond W. Smith would remain chairman and chief executive officer of Bell Atlantic and Seidenberg would serve as vice chairman, president, and chief operating officer. After one year, Seidenberg would become chief executive officer of the new company, and chairman upon Smith&#x27;s retirement. In an effort to avoid a Congressional vote on the merger, the transaction was turned into an acquisition of NYNEX by Bell Atlantic in June. 

The final merger took place on August 14, 1997, in what was at the time the second-largest merger in corporate history in America. Although the surviving company was Bell Atlantic, the merged company moved from the headquarters of Bell Atlantic in Philadelphia to the headquarters of NYNEX in New York City. In the time leading up to, and immediately after the merger, there was reported to be a mass exodus of top NYNEX executives as Bell Atlantic took more control. 

In September, the new Bell Atlantic rolled out a marketing campaign to inform existing NYNEX customers about the change in the company&#x27;s name. In April 2000, Bell Atlantic announced it would acquire GTE and form Verizon Communications; the deal closed on June 30.

==Criticism==
Throughout its existence, NYNEX struggled with service quality. The dense and shifting population of New York City, high demand for fax and internet lines, hard-to-reach physical environments in places like Brooklyn, and frequent theft of copper wires were all identified as factors attributing to service issues. However, NYNEX was also guilty of letting its network deteriorate in some areas and cutting thousands of jobs that left the company unable to meet rising demand. Of the seven regional Bell companies, the FCC ranked it last in customer satisfaction in 1993.

In the fourth quarter of 1994 alone, NYNEX&#x27;s New York City customers reported 99,145 service outages, while repair teams missed 61,500 appointments. According to the New York State Public Service Commission that represented a 30% rise over 1993 in missed repair appointments, a 40% rise in the number of lines reported out of service for more than 24 hours and a whopping 107% rise in complaints. In 1995, the state of New York proposed a new turnaround plan intended to help NYNEX improve its customer service. However, there were concerns that it would not work and that the rate reductions proposed by the plan would be too inconsistent.

The State of New York impounded $4.1 million of regulated fees collected by NYNEX in August 1996 for failing to meet specific service metrics that had been set by the public utility commission in its order setting service rates. The Public Service Commission imposed $62.3 million in fines on NYNEX in November after it missed customer service benchmarks.

<doc id="526459" wikidata="Q1353185" url="?curid=526459" title="Power loom">
<text>A power loom is a mechanized loom, and was one of the key developments in the industrialization of weaving during the early Industrial Revolution. The first power loom was designed and patented in 1785 by Edmund Cartwright. It was refined over the next 47 years until a design by the Howard and Bullough company made the operation completely automatic. This device was designed in 1834 by James Bullough and William Kenworthy, and was named the Lancashire loom.

By the year 1850, there were a total of around 260,000 power loom operations in England. Two years later came the Northrop loom which replenished the shuttle when it was empty. This replaced the Lancashire loom.

==Shuttle looms==

The main components of the loom are the warp beam, heddles, harnesses, shuttle, reed, and takeup roll. In the loom, yarn processing includes shedding, picking, battening and taking-up operations.

* &quot;Shedding&quot;. Shedding is the raising of the warp yarns to form a loop through which the filling yarn, carried by the shuttle, can be inserted. The shed is the vertical space between the raised and unraised warp yarns. On the modern loom, simple and intricate shedding operations are performed automatically by the heddle or heald frame, also known as a harness. This is a rectangular frame to which a series of wires, called heddles or healds, are attached. The yarns are passed through the eye holes of the heddles, which hang vertically from the harnesses. The weave pattern determines which harness controls which warp yarns, and the number of harnesses used depends on the complexity of the weave. Two common methods of controlling the heddles are dobbies and a Jacquard Head. 
* &quot;Picking&quot;. As the harnesses raise the heddles or healds, which raise the warp yarns, the shed is created. The filling yarn is inserted through the shed by a small carrier device called a shuttle. The shuttle is normally pointed at each end to allow passage through the shed. In a traditional shuttle loom, the filling yarn is wound onto a quill, which in turn is mounted in the shuttle. The filling yarn emerges through a hole in the shuttle as it moves across the loom. A single crossing of the shuttle from one side of the loom to the other is known as a pick. As the shuttle moves back and forth across the shed, it weaves an edge, or selvage, on each side of the fabric to prevent the fabric from raveling. 
* &quot;Battening&quot;. As the shuttle moves across the loom laying down the fill yarn, it also passes through openings in another frame called a reed (which resembles a comb). With each picking operation, the reed presses or battens each filling yarn against the portion of the fabric that has already been formed. The point where the fabric is formed is called the fell. Conventional shuttle looms can operate at speeds of about 150 to 200 picks per minute
With each weaving operation, the newly constructed fabric must be wound on a cloth beam. This process is called taking up. At the same time, the warp yarns must be let off or released from the warp beams. To become fully automatic, a loom needs a filling stop motion which will brake the loom, if the weft thread breaks.

== Operation ==

Operation of weaving in a textile mill is undertaken by a specially trained operator known as a weaver. Weavers are expected to uphold high industry standards and are tasked with monitoring anywhere from ten to as many as thirty separate looms at any one time. During their operating shift, weavers will first utilize a wax pencil or crayon to sign their initials onto the cloth to mark a shift change, and then walk along the cloth side (front) of the looms they tend, gently touching the fabric as it comes from the reed. This is done to feel for any broken &quot;picks&quot; or filler thread. Should broken picks be detected, the weaver will disable the machine and undertake to correct the error, typically by replacing the bobbin of filler thread in as little time as possible. They are trained that, ideally, no machine should stop working for more than one minute, with faster turnaround times being preferred.

Operation of this needs more than 2 people because of the way it works.

==History==

The first ideas for an automatic loom were developed in 1784 by M. de Gennes in Paris and by Vaucanson in 1745, but these designs were never developed and were forgotten. In 1785 Edmund Cartwright patented a power loom which used water power to speed up the weaving process, the predecessor to the modern power loom. His ideas were licensed first by Grimshaw of Manchester who built a small steam-powered weaving factory in Manchester in 1790, but the factory burnt down. Cartwright&#x27;s was not a commercially successful machine; his looms had to be stopped to dress the warp. Over the next decades, Cartwright&#x27;s ideas were modified into a reliable automatic loom. These designs followed John Kay&#x27;s invention of the flying shuttle, and they passed the shuttle through the shed using levers. With the increased speed of weaving, weavers were able to use more thread than spinners could produce.

===Series of initial inventors===
A series of inventors incrementally improved all aspects of the three principal processes and the ancillary processes. 
* Grimshaw of Manchester (1790): dressing the warp 
* Austin (1789, 1790): dressing the warp, 200 looms produced for Monteith of Pollockshaws 1800
* Thomas Johnson of Bredbury (1803): dressing frame, factory for 200 steam looms on Manchester in 1806, and two factories at Stockport in 1809. One at Westhoughton, Lancashire (1809).
* William Radcliffe of Stockport (1802): improved take up mechanism
* John Todd of Burnley (1803): a heald roller and new shedding arrangements, the healds were corded to treadles actuated by cams on the second shaft.
* William Horrocks of Stockport (1803): The frame was still wooden but the lathe was pendant from the frame and operated by cams on the first shaft, the shedding was operated by cams on the second shaft, the take up motion was copied from Radcliffe.
* Peter Marsland (1806): improvements to the lathe motion to counteract poor picking
* William Cotton (1810): improvements to the letting off motion
* William Horrocks (1813): Horrocks loom, modifications to the lathe motion, improving on Marsland
* Peter Ewart (1813): a use of pneumatics
* Joseph and Peter Taylor (1815): double beat foot lathe for heavy cloths
* Paul Moody (1815): produces the first power loom in North America. Exporting a UK loom would have been illegal.
* John Capron and Sons (1820): installed the first power looms for woolens in North America at Uxbridge, Massachusetts.
* William Horrocks (1821): a system to wet the warp and weft during use, improving the effectiveness of the sizing
* Richard Roberts (1830): Roberts Loom, These improvements were a geared take up wheel and tappets to operate multiple heddles
* Stanford, Pritchard and Wilkinson: patented a method to stop on the break of weft or warp. It was not used.
* William Dickinson of Blackburn: Blackburn Loom, the modern overpick

===Further useful improvements===
There now appear a series of useful improvements that are contained in patents for useless devices
* Horny, Kenworthy and Bullough of Blackburn (1834): the vibrating or fly reed
* John Ramsbottom and Richard Holt of Todmorden (1834): a new automatic weft stopping motion
* James Bullough of Blackburn (1835): improved automatic weft stopping motion and taking up and letting off arrangements
* Andrew Parkinson (1836): improved stretcher (temple).
* William Kenworthy and James Bullough (1841): trough and roller temple (became the standard), A simple stop-motion.
At this point the loom has become automatic except for refilling weft pirns. The Cartwight loom weaver could work one loom at 120-130 picks per minute- with a Kenworthy and Bullough&#x27;s Lancashire Loom, a weaver can run four or more looms working at 220-260 picks per minute- thus giving eight (or more) times more throughput.
* James Henry Northrop (1894) invented a self-threading shuttle and shuttle spring jaws to hold a bobbin by means of rings on the butt. This paved the way to his automatic filling and changing battery of 1891, the basic feature of the Northrop Loom. The principal advantage of the Northrop loom was that it was fully automatic; when a warp thread broke, the loom stopped until it was fixed. When the shuttle ran out of thread, Northrop&#x27;s mechanism ejected the depleted pirn and loaded a new full one without stopping. A loom operative could work 16 or more looms whereas previously they could only operate eight. Thus, the labor cost was halved. Mill owners had to decide whether the labor saving was worth the capital investment in a new loom. In all 700,000 looms were sold. By 1914, Northrop looms made up 40% of American looms. Northrop was responsible for several hundred weaving related patents.

== Looms and the Manchester context==
The development of the power loom in and around Manchester was not a coincidence. Manchester had been a centre for Fustians by 1620 and acted as a hub for other Lancashire towns, so developing a communication network with them. It was an established point of export using the meandering River Mersey, and by 1800 it had a thriving canal network, with links to the Ashton Canal, Rochdale Canal the Peak Forest Canal and Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal. The fustian trade gave the towns a skilled workforce that was used to the complicated Dutch looms, and was perhaps accustomed to industrial discipline. While Manchester became a spinning town, the towns around were weaving towns producing cloth by the &quot;putting out&quot; system. The business was dominated by a few families, who had the capital needed to invest in new mills and to buy hundreds of looms. Mills were built along the new canals, so immediately had access to their markets. Spinning developed first and, until 1830, the handloom was still more important economically than the power loom when the roles reversed. Because of the economic growth of Manchester, a new industry of precision machine tool engineering was born and here were the skills needed to build the precision mechanisms of a loom.

===Adoption===

Draper&#x27; strategy was to standardize on a couple of Northrop Loom models which it mass-produced. The lighter E-model of 1909 was joined in the 1930 by the heavier X-model. Continuous fibre machines, say for rayon, which was more break-prone, needed a specialist loom. This was provided by the purchase of the Stafford Loom Co. in 1932, and using their patents a third loom the XD, was added to the range. Because of their mass production techniques they were reluctant and slow to retool for new technologies such as shuttleless looms.

===Decline and reinvention===
Originally, power looms used a shuttle to throw the weft across, but in 1927 the faster and more efficient shuttleless loom came into use. Sulzer Brothers, a Swiss company had the exclusive rights to shuttleless looms in 1942, and licensed the American production to Warner &amp; Swasey. Draper licensed the slower rapier loom. Today, advances in technology have produced a variety of looms designed to maximise production for specific types of material. The most common of these are Sulzer shuttleless weaving machines, rapier looms, air-jet looms and water-jet looms.

==Social and economic implications==

Power looms reduced demand for skilled handweavers, initially causing reduced wages and unemployment. Protests followed their introduction. For example, in 1816 two thousand rioting Calton weavers tried to destroy power loom mills and stoned the workers.
In the longer term, by making cloth more affordable the power loom increased demand and stimulated exports, causing a growth in industrial employment, albeit low-paid.
The power loom also opened up opportunities for women mill workers.
A darker side of the power loom&#x27;s impact was the growth of employment of children in power loom mills.

== Dangers ==

There are a number of inherent dangers in the machines, to which inattentive or poorly trained weavers can fall victim. The most obvious is the moving reed, the frames which hold the heddles and the &quot;pinch&quot; or &quot;sand&quot; roll utilized to keep the cloth tight as it passes over the front of the machine and onto the doff roll. The most common injury in weaving is pinched fingers from distracted or bored workers, though this is not the only such injury found. There are numerous accounts of weavers with long hair getting it tangled in the warp itself and having their scalp pulled away from the skull, or large chunks of hair pulled off. As a result of this, it has become industry standard for companies to require weavers to either keep hair up and tied, or to keep their hair short so as not to allow it to become tangled. Also, due to possible pinch points on the front of machines, loose, baggy clothing is prohibited. In addition, there is a risk of the shuttle flying out of the loom at a high-speed (200+ mph/322 kmh) and striking a worker if the moving reed encounters a thread/yarn or other mechanical jam/error. One complication for weavers, in the terms of safety, is the loud nature in which weave mills operate (115dB+). Because of this, it is nearly impossible to hear a person calling for help when entangled. This has led OSHA to outline specific guidelines for companies to mitigate the chances of such accidents occurring. However, even with such guidelines in place, injuries in textile production due to the machines themselves, are still commonplace.

<text>The Heartbreakers (sometimes referred to as &quot;Johnny Thunders&#x27; Heartbreakers&quot; in order to avoid confusion with the band Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers), were an American punk rock band formed in New York City in 1975. The band spearheaded the first wave of punk rock.

== History ==
Johnny Thunders (vocals/guitar) and Jerry Nolan (drums) gained fame in the pioneering proto-punk band the New York Dolls. By early 1975, the Dolls were disintegrating amid poor record sales and tensions within the band, and Thunders and Nolan quit during a tour of Florida in March 1975. Coincidentally, that same week Richard Hell (vocals/bass) left Television. After returning to New York, Thunders and Nolan invited Hell to join their new band, and Hell agreed. As Hell said, &quot;I was fed up with Television because it was getting so pretentious...so I thought, this is perfect – we&#x27;ll make a really good rock &amp; roll band that&#x27;s dealing with interesting subjects.&quot; The three dubbed their new band the Heartbreakers. Their first gig was on May 30 of that year, at the Coventry, a rock club in Queens. (Tom Petty&#x27;s band was also named the Heartbreakers, but they did not begin gigging until 1976.) The trio auditioned several candidates for a second guitarist, and soon added Walter Lure to the lineup. Lure, who had previously played with a glam-punk band called the Demons, played his first show with the Heartbreakers on July 4, 1975, at CBGB.

The band quickly became one of the most popular and well-known underground bands in New York City, headlining shows at CBGB, Mother&#x27;s (located across from the Chelsea Hotel), and Max&#x27;s Kansas City. In the band&#x27;s early days, each member took turns on vocals, with Hell bringing in songs (such as &quot;Blank Generation&quot;) originally written for Television, and Thunders contributing new material as well. Lure began singing lead on some songs and co-writing with Nolan. The combination of the style-conscious Nolan and Thunders with the beatnik Hell and gangly Lure made for a visually arresting and musically powerful group. As Blondie&#x27;s Clem Burke said, &quot;You could call them the punk rock Beatles. Each person really stood out.&quot; Although popular, the early lineup could not get a recording contract, in no small part due to the band&#x27;s well-known heroin use – as vividly described in their best-known song, &quot;Chinese Rocks&quot; (which was actually written by Dee Dee Ramone with contributions from Hell). Live recordings of the Thunders/Hell/Nolan/Lure lineup were eventually released on the LP &quot;Live at Mother&#x27;s&quot;, and studio demos were released in 2019.

Although initially the band members shared songwriting and singing, Hell increasingly attempted to impose his will on the band. At a rehearsal in early 1976, Hell laid down an ultimatum – he would sing most of the songs in the set, with Thunders relegated to one or two songs per set. Thunders walked out, and Nolan and Lure followed; with all three united against him, Hell wound up leaving the band. His final show was on May 14, 1976, at the Rathskeller in Boston. After auditioning several bass players, the band settled on Boston transplant Billy Rath. Hell went on to form his own band, Richard Hell and the Voidoids.

Replacing Hell with Rath solidified the Heartbreakers sound, firmly rooted in 1950s rock and rhythm &#x27;n&#x27; blues, but with the energy, volume, and attitude of punk. Rath was a better bassist than Hell, meshing with Nolan to form a formidable rhythm section, and was also content with playing a supporting role in the band without seeking the spotlight. Now managed by Leee Black Childers, the band also consciously emphasized their New York street-tough image, abandoning the glam rock look Thunders and Nolan had flaunted in the New York Dolls in favor of short hair and &#x27;50s style suits. The first gigs with the new lineup took place on July 23 and 24, 1976 at Max&#x27;s Kansas City and earned rave reviews. The band continued to gig regularly in New York City throughout the summer and fall, and played several shows in Boston in September. Despite Childers&#x27; efforts and a reputation as a must-see live act, no recording contract was forthcoming, a situation that became increasingly frustrating. Lure wrote that &quot;the kind of deals being offered were laughable, sleazy 50-50 splits that the bands could never, ever hope to profit from.&quot; Although the band regularly drew packed crowds at Max&#x27;s and other venues, by this point Thunders, Nolan, and Lure were heroin addicts (Rath preferred methamphetamine), so money was tight.

The band got what seemed like a break when the Sex Pistols invited the band to open for them on the ill-fated Anarchy Tour (the Sex Pistols at this time were managed by Malcolm McLaren, who had previously managed The New York Dolls). Arriving for the tour just as the UK punk scene was building momentum, the Heartbreakers quickly developed a following in and around London despite most of the shows on the tour being canceled. As Childers said, &quot;The Heartbreakers blew everyone away, for no more reason than they were just more experienced – they had their roots in rhythm and blues and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll...no matter how anarchic an audience thinks it is, if the bass player can actually play, and the drummer is Jerry Nolan, suddenly they&#x27;re going &#x27;this is GREAT&#x27;!&quot; At Childers&#x27; behest, the band stayed in London after the conclusion of the tour in order to play more gigs and earn a recording contract. Sold-out gigs at London clubs Dingwalls and the Roxy established the band as one of the top groups in the nascent punk scene, and eventually they signed a contract with Track Records in the spring of 1977, earning a substantial advance and beginning work on their debut album.

By this point, the band members&#x27; addictions were out of control, despite being enrolled in the British methadone program. Nolan later acknowledged that &quot;everything we did revolved around drugs.&quot; Recording sessions for the new album were derailed by drug use – on the part of band members as well as producer Speedy Keen – leading to innumerable attempts at recording and mixing at different studios. The first release from the sessions was the single &quot;Chinese Rocks&quot; b/w &quot;Born To Lose&quot;, released in May 1977, which sold well despite being criticized for its poor sound. Nolan admitted &quot;I think it&#x27;s okay, but not great,&quot; and Lure added &quot;The record wasn&#x27;t really up to par production wise.&quot; Band members continued to attempt to remix the album at various studios in London throughout the summer of 1977, but the problems persisted. In the studio, the band could not seem to capture the power of their live shows – the recordings sounded muddy and lifeless, especially Nolan&#x27;s drums.

As a live act, at this point the Heartbreakers were second to none – a summer tour of the UK was very successful, with a &quot;New Musical Express&quot; review describing one gig as &quot;the nearest thing I ever saw to Beatlemania.&quot; In August, the band returned to New York City to play three nights at the Village Gate, their first shows in their hometown in nearly a year. Recalled Lure, &quot;It was probably the best shows we ever played in New York, only because we were so tight from touring for six months.&quot; These now-legendary shows – which one observer called some of the best rock shows ever – were eventually released as a live album in 2015.

After the Village Gate shows, the band returned to England to attempt to finalize the album, entitled &quot;L.A.M.F.&quot; (New York gang slang for &quot;like a motherfucker&quot;.) Nolan was most vocal about his dissatisfaction with the recordings, and attempted to remix the album himself – but with no better results. Track Records pressured the band to release the album by October 1977 in order to get it in stores for the holiday season; Nolan threatened to quit if the album was released as is, and when the other three members agreed to Track&#x27;s demands, Nolan followed through and left the band. Upon its release, the album received excellent reviews, but still drew criticism for its poor sound – especially compared to the Clash and the Sex Pistols albums released the same year. Much of the blame went to Keen, who was not a trained recording engineer, but problems with the mastering process likely affected the record as well. L.A.M.F. would ultimately be remixed and rereleased multiple times to try to extract the band&#x27;s raw power from the master tapes. As Childers said, the album&#x27;s failure to capture the Heartbreakers&#x27; live sound was &quot;the biggest, hugest fuck-up in the history of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot;

With Nolan out of the band, Thunders, Lure, and Rath recruited the Sex Pistols&#x27; Paul Cook to play drums on a fall tour of the UK, but soon asked Nolan to rejoin as a hired musician. Nolan finished the tour, but then left again to start a new band, the Idols. The Heartbreakers did a short European tour in November and December with Terry Chimes on drums, after which Lure and Rath returned to New York to attempt to recruit a permanent replacement on drums. The band again found themselves without a recording contract when Track Records went bankrupt – fortunately, due to a provision Childers had inserted in their contract, they were able to recover the master tapes for L.A.M.F. as well as other live recordings. But without a new recording contract, Thunders decided to attempt a solo career, and the band ultimately broke up in early 1978.

Thunders remained in London, playing shows with various musicians, and recording his solo debut &quot;So Alone&quot; (which featured Lure and Rath on a few tracks.) That summer, the three found themselves in New York and decided to play some &quot;farewell&quot; shows – as Lure acknowledged, &quot;we were all strung out, we were all in town, and we all needed money.&quot; Minus Nolan, the band booked a series of shows at Max&#x27;s Kansas City with drummer Ty Styx sitting in. Realizing that the band would not last much longer, Max&#x27;s booker Peter Crowley arranged for the shows on September 16, 1978, to be recorded for a live album, The eventual release, &quot;Live at Max&#x27;s Kansas City &#x27;79,&quot; would become an immediate classic, capturing the band&#x27;s live energy as &quot;L.A.M.F.&quot; had conspicuously failed to do.

Nolan eventually rejoined the band in March 1979, and the reunited quartet continued to play regularly in New York throughout 1979 and 1980. But there was no attempt to write new songs or record new material – the gigs were purely &quot;rent parties&quot; to help the members stay afloat financially (and pay for their addictions.) In 1984, the band was able to rerelease a remixed version of &quot;L.A.M.F.,&quot; and did a reunion tour of Europe in 1984 that led to a live video and album recorded at The Lyceum Ballroom London on March 25, 1984. Billy Rath left the band and the music business after the reunion tour, and was replaced by Tony Coiro. Thunders and Nolan continued their careers solo and (in Nolan&#x27;s case) with other bands; they toured together in 1986 and 1987. Lure formed his own band, the Waldos, as well as occasionally playing with Thunders at New York gigs.

The Heartbreakers&#x27; final show was on November 30, 1990, at the Marquee in New York City, with Coiro on bass. Although both Thunders and Nolan were in deteriorating health by this point, the show went well.

== Post-Heartbreakers ==
Johnny Thunders died in April 1991. His body was found in a hotel room in New Orleans. While Thunders&#x27; death may have been drug-related, there is some controversy surrounding the facts of his death as the level of methadone in Thunders&#x27; body may not have constituted a fatal dose. Thunders also suffered from various health problems, with his autopsy showing evidence of advanced leukemia. In June 1991, a memorial concert was held for Thunders&#x27; family, at which Lure, Jerry Nolan, Coiro, and Joey Pinter played a set of Heartbreakers songs.

Jerry Nolan died in 1992 following a stroke he suffered in hospital, while being treated for meningitis and pneumonia. He had been diagnosed with HIV several years prior to his death.

Walter Lure had an unconventional post-Heartbreakers career, working as a stock broker on Wall Street. He remained active in the music world with his Heartbreakers-style band the Waldos, who played regularly in New York City; Lure would also do an international tour once or twice a year. Lure was diagnosed in July 2020 with liver and lung cancer, which spread rapidly, and he died from complications related to the cancer on August 21, 2020, at the age of 71.

Billy Rath disappeared from the music scene after leaving the Heartbreakers in the mid-1980s, and he undertook a period of rehabilitation to recover from the effects of sustained abuse of drugs and alcohol. Rath then went on to study for a degree in psychology and a postgraduate qualification in theology, working as a substance use disorder counselor. After being persuaded to attend the Max&#x27;s Kansas City reunion gig in September 2010, Rath reentered the music world and briefly fronted a new band, the Street Pirates. He died on August 16, 2014, aged 66.

&quot;L.A.M.F.&quot; is now considered one of the most influential albums of the first wave of punk. The album has been remixed multiple times; a 4-CD &quot;Definitive Edition&quot; was released in 2012, which included two remixes of the original LP along with demos and rare tracks. Multiple live recordings have been released as well, from both the early lineup with Hell and the &quot;L.A.M.F.&quot; lineup.

<doc id="526463" wikidata="Q455166" url="?curid=526463" title="Edmund Cartwright">
<text>Edmund Cartwright (24 April 174330 October 1823) was an English inventor. He graduated from Oxford University and went on to invent the power loom. Married to local Elizabeth McMac at 19, he was the brother of Major John Cartwright, a political reformer and radical, and George Cartwright, explorer of Labrador.

==Life==
He was the fourth son of William Cartwright and his wife Anne née Cartwright, born at Marnham, Nottinghamshire. He was educated at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield. He matriculated in 1760 at University College, Oxford, where he had studied under-age from 1757. He graduated B.A. in 1764, M.A. in 1766, elected a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford in 1764. He was awarded the degree of DD in 1806. 

Ordained deacon in the Church of England in 1765, and priest in 1767, Cartwright was appointed rector of Kilvington in 1767. With other livings, in 1779 he became also rector of Goadby Marwood, Leicestershire, and in 1783, he was elected a prebendary at Lincoln Cathedral. 

For a time Cartwright served as chaplain to the Duke of Bedford at Woburn Abbey and acted as tutor to the Duke&#x27;s son, the future Prime Minister Lord John Russell. Following the award of the parliamentary grant, Cartwright purchased a small farm in Kent, where he spent the rest of his life. 

Edmund Cartwright died in Sussex after a lingering illness and was buried at Battle.

==Power loom==
Cartwright designed his first power loom in 1784 and patented it in 1785, after some contact with textile men from Manchester; its value was only in proof of concept, but the type of design continued into the 20th century. Subsequent research and development work by others is now given much of the credit for a practical powered loom. In 1809 Cartwright obtained a grant of £10,000 from parliament for his invention.

In 1789, Cartwright patented another loom which served as the model for later inventors to work upon. For a mechanically driven loom to become a commercial success, either one person would have to be able to attend to more than one machine, or each machine must have a greater productive capacity than one manually controlled. He added improvements, including a positive let-off motion, warp and weft stop motions, and sizing the warp while the loom was in action. He commenced to manufacture fabrics in Doncaster using these looms, and discovered many of their shortcomings. He attempted to remedy these in a number of ways: by introducing a crank and eccentric wheels to actuate its batten differentially, by improving the picking mechanism, by means of a device for stopping the loom when a shuttle failed to enter a shuttle box, by preventing a shuttle from rebounding when in a box, and by stretching the cloth with temples that acted automatically. His mill was repossessed by creditors in 1793.

In 1792, Cartwright obtained his final patent for weaving machinery; this provided his loom with multiple shuttle boxes for weaving checks and cross stripes. All his efforts were unavailing, however; it became apparent that no mechanism, however perfect, could succeed so long as warps continued to be sized while a loom was stationary. His plans for sizing them while a loom was in operation, and before being placed in a loom, failed. These problems were resolved in 1803, by William Radcliffe and his assistant Thomas Johnson, by their inventions of the beam warper, and the dressing sizing machine.

In 1790 Robert Grimshaw of Gorton, Manchester erected a weaving factory at Knott Mill which he intended to fill with 500 of Cartwright&#x27;s power looms, but with only 30 in place the factory was burnt down, probably as an act of arson inspired by the fears of hand loom weavers. The prospect of success was not sufficiently promising to induce its re-erection.

In May 1821, Cartwright was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

==Other inventions==
Cartwright patented a wool combing machine in 1789 and a cordelier (machine for making rope) in 1792. He also designed a steam engine that used alcohol instead of water.

==Works==
Cartwright had John Langhorne as a tutor, and developed as a minor poet. He published the poem &quot;Armine and Elvira&quot; in 1770, which was followed by &quot;The Prince of Peace&quot; in 1779, directed against the American Revolutionary War. His &quot;Sonnets to Eminent Men&quot; (1783) included an ode to Thomas Howard, 3rd Earl of Effingham, a conspicuous supporter of American independence.

==Family==
Cartwright married in 1772, Alice Whitaker, daughter of Alderman Richard Whitaker of Doncaster, who died in 1785. Their second daughter Elizabeth (1780–1837) married the Reverend John Penrose and wrote books under the pseudonym &quot;Mrs Markham&quot;. Their daughter Mary married Henry Eustatius Strickland, a younger son of Sir George Strickland, 5th Baronet, and was mother of Hugh Edwin Strickland. She was her father&#x27;s biographer, publishing &quot;A Memoir of the Life, Writings, and Inventions, of Edmund Cartwright, D.D. FRS&quot; (1843) which incorporated a memoir by Cartwright.

Their son the Rev. Edmund Cartwright (1773–1833) was a Fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society of Antiquaries of London. The youngest child of the marriage was Frances Dorothy Cartwright, poet and biographer of her uncle the radical Major John Cartwright. 

Cartwright married secondly, in 1790, Susannah Kearney, daughter of John Kearney. He was survived by her and the four children above from his first marriage.
Growing up he also had many siblings, including the famous John Cartwright.

<text>The Iroquois mythic hero Sosondowah was a great hunter known for stalking a supernatural elk, Oh-je-a-neh-doh. Sosondowah was captured by Dawn, a goddess who needed him as a watchman. He fell in love with Gendenwitha (&quot;she who brings the day&quot;, also spelled Gendewitha), a human woman. He tried to woo her by singing to her in spring as a bluebird, in summer as a blackbird and in autumn as a hawk, who then tried to take Gendenwitha with him to the sky. Dawn tied him to her doorpost and then changed Gendenwitha into the Morning Star, so he could watch her all night but never be with her.

==Personal life==
Headley was born in Trinidad, the daughter of Hannah and Eric Headley (Barbadian). In 1989, she moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana, in the United States at the age of fifteen with her mother and brother Eric Junior when her father was offered a job as pastor of McKee Street Church of God with headquarters in Anderson, Indiana. Headley attended Northrop High School, and was a member of their resident show choir, Charisma, and starred as Fanny Brice in the school&#x27;s production of &quot;Funny Girl&quot;. After graduating from high school, Headley attended Northwestern University from 1993 to 1996, to study musical theatre until the last day of her junior year, when she made the decision to become a part of the musical &quot;Ragtime&quot; and leave school.

In 2003, Headley married Brian Musso, an investment advisor who briefly played for the New York Jets. Both attended Northwestern University. On December 1, 2009, they welcomed their first child John David. Headley had her second son Jordan Chase August 18, 2014. In April 2019, the couple welcomed a third child, a daughter.

Headley regularly performs with Vertical Church Band, the worship team from Harvest Bible Chapel. She is featured in their song &quot;How Great Is The Love&quot; and &quot;All Glory&quot;.

==Career==
Headley&#x27;s stage career began in 1996 when she was cast as a member of the ensemble in the original Toronto production of the musical &quot;Ragtime&quot; where she was an understudy for Audra McDonald in the role of Sarah. Her breakthrough came the following year when she originated the role of Nala in the Broadway musical &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Headley&#x27;s performance was well received, and she then originated the title role in the Broadway adaptation of &quot;Aida&quot;, earning the Tony Award for Best Actress in 2000. In 1999, she appeared in the Encores! staged concert production of &quot;Do Re Mi&quot;, with Nathan Lane, Randy Graff, and Brian Stokes Mitchell. She starred in an Actors&#x27; Fund of America benefit concert version of the musical &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; alongside McDonald and Lillias White in 2001.

In the autumn of 2006, Heather performed Hal David and Burt Bacharach&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall In Love Again&quot;, from the 1968 musical &quot;Promises, Promises&quot;, for &quot;The Kennedy Center Presents: The 2006 Mark Twain Prize&quot;, honoring playwright Neil Simon. The ceremony was later broadcast on PBS.

On July 5, 2007, Headley made a guest appearance for Andrea Bocelli&#x27;s Vivere Live in Tuscany concert in Lajatico, Italy. They performed Vivo Per Lei and The Prayer. Headley sang &quot;My Country, &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot; (also known as &quot;America&quot;) with Josh Groban on January 18, 2009, during the We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial. On March 12, 2009, Headley sang &quot;I Wish&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;.

From November 2012 until August 2013, Headley played the role of Rachel Marron, in the musical adaptation of Whitney Houston&#x27;s 1992 movie, &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; at London&#x27;s Adelphi Theatre. She was nominated for an Olivier Award and a What&#x27;s On Stage Award for this performance.

Heather joined the Andrea Bocelli UK Tour playing Glasgow Hydro on November 23 and at the Leeds First Direct Arena on November 24, 2013.

On May 10, 2016, Headley assumed the role of Shug Avery from Jennifer Hudson in the recent Broadway revival of &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, which closed on January 8, 2017, at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre.

In May 2022, Headley played the Witch in the Encores! version of &quot;Into the Woods&quot;. She starred alongside Sara Bareilles, Neil Patrick Harris, Gavin Creel, and Denée Benton.

===Music===
Headley released her debut album, &quot;This Is Who I Am&quot;, in October 2002 with RCA Records. Although its first single, &quot;He Is&quot;, was not very successful, the second single, &quot;I Wish I Wasn&#x27;t&quot;, achieved moderate success. The work on this album earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance and for Best New Artist making her the first Tony Award winner to be nominated for this award.

Her second album, &quot;In My Mind&quot; (2006) was delayed due to the various executive shake-ups associated with RCA parent BMG&#x27;s merger with Sony. Under BMG North America chairman/CEO Clive Davis for the first time, Headley released her second album &quot;In My Mind&quot; in January 2006. The title track &quot;In My Mind&quot; (written and produced by India.Arie collaborator Shannon Sanders) was released as the first single; and its music video was directed by Diane Martel. The song reached number-one on the U.S. Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The second single &quot;Me Time&quot; was sent to Urban AC radio only. An album track, &quot;Am I Worth It&quot;, served to promote Headley&#x27;s New March of Dimes Educational Campaign &quot;I Want My 9 Months&quot;.

In 2009, Headley, along with Al Green, released a version of the song &quot;People Get Ready&quot; on the compilation album &quot;Oh Happy Day: An All-Star Music Celebration&quot;.

In January 2010 she won her first Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Gospel Album for &quot;Audience of One&quot; on the EMI Gospel label.

In December 2010, Headley performed a duet version of &quot;Blue Christmas&quot; and &quot;My Prayer&quot; with Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli on his &quot;My Christmas&quot; tour in 5 US cities. At the Prudential Center in Newark, NJ, on December 4, 2010, the audience insisted on a second encore with Bocelli. Bocelli had to summon the detail to go and bring her back on stage.

Headley released her album &quot;Only One in the World&quot; on September 25, 2012, with the lead single &quot;A Little While&quot;.

In September 2013, Headley appeared on &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; with Il Divo and sang &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight?&quot; from &quot;The Lion King&quot;. She also appeared with Il Divo on Broadway for a limited concert run in 2013.

===Television and film===
Starting in 2017, Headley appeared in a recurring role on the TV series &quot;She&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot; as Dr. Jamison. In 2018, she appeared in a recurring role as Gwen Garrett on the TV series &quot;Chicago Med&quot;.

In 2019, Headley was cast as one of the three leads in the Netflix series &quot;Sweet Magnolias&quot;. She also voiced the part of Fikiri as Makini&#x27;s Mother in &quot;The Lion Guard&quot;.

In 2021, Headley starred as gospel legend Clara Ward in &quot;Respect&quot;, the Aretha Franklin biopic.

<text>Sister Hazel is an American rock band from Gainesville, Florida, whose style blends elements of jangle pop, folk rock, classic rock, and Southern rock. They are best known for their 1997 single &quot;All for You.&quot;

==History==
Sister Hazel formed in Gainesville, Florida, in 1993 and was named for Sister Hazel Williams, a local missionary who ran a homeless shelter. The group released its self-titled debut album in 1994, through its independent record label Croakin&#x27; Poets. Shortly after its release, singer/guitarist Ryan Newell and drummer Mark Trojanowski joined the band. Newell played on the album before officially joining the group.

The band&#x27;s second album &quot;...Somewhere More Familiar&quot; was released in 1997 and sold approximately 30,000 copies through its initial pressing, prompting Universal Records to sign the band. Universal re-released &quot;...Somewhere More Familiar&quot; in late 1997. A single from the album &quot;All For You&quot; hit No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and remains the band&#x27;s most successful single.

The band&#x27;s third album &quot;Fortress&quot; was released in 2000 by Universal. The band worked with producers Mike Clink (Guns N&#x27; Roses, Mötley Crüe, Heart), Richie Zito (Cheap Trick), and Paul Ebersold (3 Doors Down). The album featured minor pop hits &quot;Champagne High&quot; and &quot;Change Your Mind.&quot; The album&#x27;s title track was featured as the outro of Valparaiso University radio station WVUR&#x27;s weekly Saturday night program during the 2000–01 academic year.

In 2003, after the band split from Universal, they released their fourth studio album, &quot;Chasing Daylight&quot;, on the Sixthman label and toured throughout the year to promote the album. The band&#x27;s internet presence emerged during this time period, and hardcore fans dubbing themselves &quot;Hazelnuts&quot; studied setlists, shared bootleg concert recordings, and initiated a promotion scheme with the band through their official website. 2003 also saw the simultaneous release of &quot;Live*LIVE&quot;, a two-disc live album, and &quot;A Life in the Day&quot;, a live DVD.

In 2004, Sister Hazel released their next studio album, &quot;Lift&quot;. Songs from &quot;Lift&quot; were re-recorded for 2005&#x27;s &quot;Lift: Acoustic Renditions&quot;, an EP of studio acoustic takes on five of the songs, offered exclusively through Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store. In July 2005, the &quot;Sister Hazel&quot; album was re-issued again by Sixthman, in response to claims that the album had become difficult to find in stores.

Sister Hazel then promoted their album, &quot;Absolutely&quot;, which was released on October 10, 2006. The band also continued to tour and hold annual fan gathering events, The Rock Boat and The Rock Slope. &quot;Absolutely&quot; is the band&#x27;s highest-charting album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts following &quot;Fortress&quot; and it received 4 out of a possible 5 stars from Allmusic, a tie with &quot;Fortress&quot;&#x27;s score.

On June 5, 2007, Sister Hazel released a &quot;hybrid&quot; album, &quot;BAM! Volume 1&quot;. It contains B-sides from the &quot;Absolutely&quot; recording sessions and some from previous albums. Sister Hazel also released a holiday album called &quot;Santa&#x27;s Playlist&quot; on September 25, 2007.

On February 9, 2008, the band performed a live concert at Daytona International Speedway for the Budweiser Shootout. They released a live acoustic album on June 17, 2008, &quot;Before the Amplifiers, Live Acoustic&quot; on Croakin&#x27; Poets/Rock Ridge Music. The record features 16 tracks, including the band&#x27;s hits, fan favorites, and live concert staples, all in a stripped-down, acoustic format. The album was recorded on January 12 at Nickel &amp; Dime Studios in Atlanta (other bands who have recorded there in the past include Indigo Girls, The B-52&#x27;s, Shawn Mullins) in front of a hundred fans who were chosen at random from more than five thousand entries.

At the July 18, 2008, concert at Wolf Trap Farm Park, drummer Mark Trojanowski took paternity leave for his newborn child. Former Vertical Horizon and current Doobie Brothers drummer Ed Toth played in his absence.

On July 9, 2009, Ford Motor Company announced a collaboration with Sister Hazel to promote the company&#x27;s new Sync technology, available on many Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles. The band was featured on a Ford website, syncmyride.com.

The band released their seventh studio album of original songs (tenth album overall) on August 18, 2009. The album, entitled &quot;Release&quot;, contains 12 tracks and is on the Rock Ridge Music label. On the day of release, &quot;Release&quot; was the number one album on iTunes.

Less than six months after releasing &quot;Release&quot;, the band returned to the studio to work on their new album, &quot;Heartland Highway&quot;, was released on October 12, 2010. Its first radio single was &quot;Stay a While&quot;.

The band&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Lighter in the Dark&quot;, was announced in the later part of 2015. It is their first country album, and was released on February 19, 2016. The lead single from the album is &quot;We Got It All Tonight&quot;. Two songs, &quot;We Got It All Tonight&quot; and &quot;Karaoke Song&quot;, which features country artist Darius Rucker, were made available for instant download for those who pre-ordered the album.

The band&#x27;s namesake Dr. Hazel Kirkland Williams died on July 16, 2016, at age 91 in Gainesville.

The band released an EP &quot;Water&quot; on February 9, 2018, which featured the lead single &quot;Roll On Bye&quot;. Less than a week after the release of &quot;Water&quot;, the band announced they had begun recording a follow-up EP in Nashville, Tennessee. The EP &quot;Wind&quot; was released on September 7, 2018. The next EP in the &quot;Elements&quot; series, &quot;Fire&quot;, was released on February 8, 2019. The final installment in the &quot;Elements&quot; series, &quot;Earth&quot;, was released on September 6, 2019. Each of the EPs in the series included a portion of a song at the end, intended to be linked together in a future release. On November 26, 2019, all the EPs were combined into a single release, &quot;Elements&quot;. The 25-song, double-disc set includes the final &quot;Elements&quot; song pieced together.

==Use in media==
The band has had music featured in several movies and soundtracks including &quot;Major League: Back to the Minors&quot;, &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot;, &quot;Clay Pigeons&quot;, &quot;Bedazzled&quot; and &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot;. Sister Hazel also appear on the Fleetwood Mac tribute album, &quot;Legacy: A Tribute to Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s Rumours&quot; with their cover version of &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot;. In 1999, they recorded a cover of &quot;September Gurls&quot; for the Big Star tribute album, &quot;Big Star, Small World&quot;. However, the track was not included when the album was released in 2006. The song &quot;Where Do You Go&quot; was featured on &quot;Scrubs&quot; (Season 6, Episode 4, &quot;My House&quot;). &quot;All For You&quot; was featured in episode 7 of the first season of &quot;The Way Home (TV series)&quot;

== Musical style ==
=== Influences ===
While some of the band members feel like their sounds are simply Sister Hazel, Ryan Newell has cited Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimmy Page, Van Halen, and Eric Clapton as his influences. The band has certainly been influenced by other southern rock and folk music.

==Philanthropy==
Lyrics for Life is a non-profit organization for the benefit of pediatric cancer. Sister Hazel had a benefit concert to support the Sarah Jones Scholarship Fund.

<doc id="526488" wikidata="Q406039" url="?curid=526488" title="Gold medal">
<text>A gold medal is a medal awarded for highest achievement in a non-military field. Its name derives from the use of at least a fraction of gold in form of plating or alloying in its manufacture.

Since the eighteenth century, gold medals have been awarded in the arts, for example, by the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, usually as a symbol of an award to give an outstanding student some financial freedom. Others offer only the prestige of the award. Many organizations now award gold medals either annually or extraordinarily, including various academic societies.

While some gold medals are solid gold, others are gold-plated or silver-gilt, like those of the Olympic Games, the Lorentz Medal, the United States Congressional Gold Medal and the Nobel Prize medal. Nobel Prize medals consist of 18 karat green gold plated with 24 karat gold. Before 1980, they were struck in 23 karat gold.

==Military origins==
Before the establishment of standard military awards, e.g., the Medal of Honor, it was common practice to have a medal specially created to provide national recognition for a significant military or naval victory or accomplishment. In the United States, Congress would enact a resolution asking the President to reward those responsible. The commanding officer would receive a gold medal and his officers would get silver medals.

==Competition medals==

Medals have historically been given as prizes in various types of competitive activities, especially athletics.

Traditionally, medals are made of the following metals:

# Gold (or another yellow metal, e.g., brass)
# Silver (or another grey metal, e.g., steel)
# Bronze

Occasionally, Platinum medals can be awarded.

These metals designate the first three Ages of Man in Greek mythology: the Golden Age, when men lived among the gods, the Silver Age, where youth lasted a hundred years, and the Bronze Age, the era of heroes.

The custom of awarding the sequence of gold, silver, and bronze medals for the first three highest achievers dates from at least the 19th century, with the National Association of Amateur Athletes in the United States awarding such medals as early as 1884.

This standard was adopted for Olympic competition at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis. At the 1896 event, silver was awarded to winners and bronze to runners-up, while in 1900 other prizes were given, not medals.

==Olympic Games==

At the modern Olympic Games, winners of a sporting discipline receive a gold medal in recognition of their achievement.

At the Ancient Olympic Games, only one winner per event received an award, which was a kotinos, an olive wreath made of wild olive leaves from a sacred tree near the temple of Zeus at Olympia. Aristophanes in Plutus makes a remark why victorious athletes are crowned with wreaths made of wild olive instead of gold. 
Herodotus describes a story that explains why there were only a few Greek men at the Battle of Thermopylae since &quot;all other men were participating in the Olympic Games&quot; and that the prize for the winner was &quot;an olive-wreath&quot;. When Tigranes, an Armenian general, learned this, he uttered to his leader: &quot;Good heavens! What kind of men are these against whom you have brought us to fight? Men who do not compete for possessions, but for honour&quot;.

At the 1896 Summer Olympics, winners received a silver medal and the second-place finisher received a bronze medal. In 1900, most winners received cups or trophies instead of medals. The next three Olympics (1904, 1908, 1912) awarded the winners solid gold medals, but the medals themselves were smaller. The use of gold rapidly declined with the onset of the First World War and also with the onset of the Second World War. The last series of Olympic medals to be made of solid gold were awarded at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden.

Olympic gold medals are required to be made from at least 92.5% silver, and must contain a minimum of 6 grams of gold. All Olympic medals must be at least 70mm in diameter and 3mm thick. Minting the medals is the responsibility of the Olympic host. From 1928 through 1968 the design was always the same: the obverse showed a generic design by Florentine artist Giuseppe Cassioli of Greek goddess Nike with Rome&#x27;s Colosseum in the background and text naming the host city; the reverse showed another generic design of Nike saluting an Olympic champion.

From the 1972 Summer Olympics through 2000, Cassioli&#x27;s design (or a slight modification) remained on the obverse with a custom design by the host city on the reverse. Noting that Cassioli&#x27;s design showed a Roman amphitheater for what originally were Greek games, a new obverse design was commissioned for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. For the 2008 Beijing Olympics medals had a diameter of 70mm and were 6mm thick, with the front displaying a winged figure of victory and the back showed a Beijing Olympics symbol surrounded by an inset jade circle.

Winter Olympics medals have been of more varied design. The silver and bronze medals have always borne the same designs.

==Other gold medal awards==
The award of a gold medal, often coupled with the award of silver and bronze medals to the next place finishers, has been adopted in other sports competitions (such as the Mediterranean Games), and in other competitive fields, such as music and writing, as well as some competitive games. Typically bronze medals are awarded only to third place, but in some contests there is some variety, such as International barbershop music contests where bronze medals are awarded for third, fourth, and fifth place.

<doc id="526495" wikidata="Q497118" url="?curid=526495" title="Parchive">
<text>Parchive (a portmanteau of parity archive, and formally known as Parity Volume Set Specification) is an erasure code system that produces par files for checksum verification of data integrity, with the capability to perform data recovery operations that can repair or regenerate corrupted or missing data. 

Parchive was originally written to solve the problem of reliable file sharing on Usenet, but it can be used for protecting any kind of data from data corruption, disc rot, bit rot, and accidental or malicious damage. Despite the name, Parchive uses more advanced techniques (specifically error correction codes) than simplistic parity methods of error detection.

As of 2014, PAR1 is obsolete, PAR2 is mature for widespread use, and PAR3 is a discontinued experimental version developed by MultiPar author Yutaka Sawada. The original SourceForge Parchive project has been inactive since April 30, 2015. A new PAR3 specification has been worked on since April 28, 2019 by PAR2 specification author Michael Nahas. An alpha version of the PAR3 specification has been published on January 29, 2022 while the program itself is being developed.

== History ==
Parchive was intended to increase the reliability of transferring files via Usenet newsgroups. Usenet was originally designed for informal conversations, and the underlying protocol, NNTP was not designed to transmit arbitrary binary data. Another limitation, which was acceptable for conversations but not for files, was that messages were normally fairly short in length and limited to 7-bit ASCII text.

Various techniques were devised to send files over Usenet, such as uuencoding and Base64. Later Usenet software allowed 8 bit Extended ASCII, which permitted new techniques like yEnc. Large files were broken up to reduce the effect of a corrupted download, but the unreliable nature of Usenet remained.

With the introduction of Parchive, parity files could be created that were then uploaded along with the original data files. If any of the data files were damaged or lost while being propagated between Usenet servers, users could download parity files and use them to reconstruct the damaged or missing files. Parchive included the construction of small index files (*.par in version 1 and *.par2 in version 2) that do not contain any recovery data. These indexes contain file hashes that can be used to quickly identify the target files and verify their integrity.

Because the index files were so small, they minimized the amount of extra data that had to be downloaded from Usenet to verify that the data files were all present and undamaged, or to determine how many parity volumes were required to repair any damage or reconstruct any missing files. They were most useful in version 1 where the parity volumes were much larger than the short index files. These larger parity volumes contain the actual recovery data along with a duplicate copy of the information in the index files (which allows them to be used on their own to verify the integrity of the data files if there is no small index file available).

In July 2001, Tobias Rieper and Stefan Wehlus proposed the Parity Volume Set specification, and with the assistance of other project members, version 1.0 of the specification was published in October 2001. Par1 used Reed–Solomon error correction to create new recovery files. Any of the recovery files can be used to rebuild a missing file from an incomplete download.

Version 1 became widely used on Usenet, but it did suffer some limitations:
* It was restricted to handle at most 255 files.
* The recovery files had to be the size of the largest input file, so it did not work well when the input files were of various sizes. (This limited its usefulness when not paired with the proprietary RAR compression tool.)
* The recovery algorithm had a bug, due to a flaw in the academic paper on which it was based.
* It was strongly tied to Usenet and it was felt that a more general tool might have a wider audience.

In January 2002, Howard Fukada proposed that a new Par2 specification should be devised with the significant changes that data verification and repair should work on blocks of data rather than whole files, and that the algorithm should switch to using 16 bit numbers rather than the 8 bit numbers that PAR1 used. Michael Nahas and Peter Clements took up these ideas in July 2002, with additional input from Paul Nettle and Ryan Gallagher (who both wrote Par1 clients). Version 2.0 of the Parchive specification was published by Michael Nahas in September 2002.

Peter Clements then went on to write the first two Par2 implementations, QuickPar and par2cmdline. Abandoned since 2004, Paul Houle created phpar2 to supersede par2cmdline. Yutaka Sawada created MultiPar to supersede QuickPar. MultiPar uses par2j.exe (which is partially based on par2cmdline&#x27;s optimization techniques) to use as MultiPar&#x27;s backend engine.

== Versions ==
Versions 1 and 2 of the file format are incompatible. (However, many clients support both.)

=== Par1 ===
For Par1, the files &quot;f1&quot;, &quot;f2&quot;, ..., &quot;fn&quot;, the Parchive consists of an index file (&quot;f.par&quot;), which is CRC type file with no recovery blocks, and a number of &quot;parity volumes&quot; (&quot;f.p01&quot;, &quot;f.p02&quot;, etc.). Given all of the original files except for one (for example, &quot;f2&quot;), it is possible to create the missing &quot;f2&quot; given all of the other original files and any one of the parity volumes. Alternatively, it is possible to recreate two missing files from any two of the parity volumes and so forth.

Par1 supports up to a total of 256 source and recovery files.

=== Par2 ===
Par2 files generally use this naming/extension system: &quot;filename.vol000+01.PAR2&quot;, &quot;filename.vol001+02.PAR2&quot;, &quot;filename.vol003+04.PAR2&quot;, &quot;filename.vol007+06.PAR2&quot;, etc. The number after the &quot;+&quot; in the filename indicates how many blocks it contains, and the number after &quot;vol&quot; indicates the number of the first recovery block within the PAR2 file. If an index file of a download states that 4 blocks are missing, the easiest way to repair the files would be by downloading &quot;filename.vol003+04.PAR2&quot;. However, due to the redundancy, &quot;filename.vol007+06.PAR2&quot; is also acceptable. There is also an index file &quot;filename.PAR2&quot;, it is identical in function to the small index file used in PAR1.

Par2 specification supports up to 32,768 source blocks and up to 65,535 recovery blocks. Input files are split into multiple equal-sized blocks so that recovery files do not need to be the size of the largest input file.

Although Unicode is mentioned in the PAR2 specification as an option, most PAR2 implementations do not support Unicode.

Directory support is included in the PAR2 specification, but most or all implementations do not support it.

=== Par3 ===
The Par3 specification was originally planned to be published as an enhancement over the Par2 specification. However, to date, it has remained closed source by specification owner Yutaka Sawada.

A discussion on a new format started in the GitHub issue section of the maintained fork par2cmdline on January 29, 2019. The discussion led to a new format which is also named as Par3. The new Par3 format&#x27;s specification is published on GitHub, but remains being an alpha draft as of January 28, 2022. The specification is written by Michael Nahas, the author of Par2 specification, with the help from Yutaka Sawada, animetosho and malaire.

The new format claims to have multiple advantages over the Par2 format, including:

* Supports more than 216 files and more than 216 blocks.
* Supports packing small files into one block, as well as deduplication when a block appears in multiple files.
* Supports UTF-8 file names, file permissions, hard links and soft links.
* Supports embedding PAR data inside other formats, like ZIP archives or ISO disk images.
* Supports &quot;incremental backups&quot;, where a user creates recovery files for some file or folder, change some data, and create new recovery files reusing some of the older files.
* Supports more error correction code algorithms (such as LDPC and sparse random matrix).
* Replaced the MD5 hash function in Par2 with BLAKE3.
* Supports empty directories.
* Supports file permissions.
* Supports hard links and symbolic links.

== Software ==

=== Multi-Platform ===
* (GPLv2) — a concurrent (multithreaded) version of par2cmdline 0.4 using TBB. Only compatible with x86 based CPUs. It is available in the FreeBSD Ports system as par2cmdline-tbb.
* Original par2cmdline — (obsolete). Available in the FreeBSD Ports system as par2cmdline.
* par2cmdline maintained fork by BlackIkeEagle.
* par2cmdline-mt is another multithreaded version of par2cmdline using OpenMP, GPLv2, or later. Currently merged into BlackIkeEagle&#x27;s fork and maintained there.
* ParPar (CC0) is a high performance, multithreaded PAR2 client and Node.js library. Does not support verifying or repair, it can currently only create PAR2 archives.
* par2deep (LGPL-3.0) — Produce, verify and repair par2 files recursively, both on the command line as well as with the aid of a graphical user interface. It is available in the Python Package Index system as par2deep.

<text>The Canadian Wheat Board () was a marketing board for wheat and barley in Western Canada. Established by the Parliament of Canada on 5 July 1935, its operation was governed by the Canadian Wheat Board Act as a mandatory producer marketing system for wheat and barley in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and a small part of British Columbia. It was illegal for any farmer in areas under the CWB&#x27;s jurisdiction to sell their wheat and barley through any other channel than the CWB. Although often called a monopoly, it was actually a monopsony since it was the only &quot;buyer&quot; of wheat and barley. It was a marketing agency acting on behalf of Western Canadian farmers, passing all profits from its operation back to farmers. Its market power over wheat and barley marketing was referred to as the &quot;Single Desk&quot;.

Amid criticism, the Canadian Wheat Board&#x27;s Single Desk marketing power officially ended on 1 August 2012 as a result of Bill C-18, also known as the Marketing Freedom for Grain Farmers Act, which was tabled by the Harper government and passed in December 2011. The Canadian Wheat Board changed its name to simply CWB, reflecting its changed status. CWB continued to operate as a grain company, although the bill also set a timeline for the eventual privatization of CWB. On 15 April 2015, it was announced that a 50.1% majority stake in CWB would be acquired by Global Grain Group, a joint venture of Bunge Limited and the Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Company, for $250 million. CWB was combined with the grain assets of Bunge Canada to form G3 Canada Limited.

The third-highest sales year for wheat industry in Canada was 2011–2012 when the CWB &quot;sold $7.2-billion worth of grain to more than 70 countries, $4.9 billion of which was paid back to farmers.&quot;

==History==

=== First wheat boards ===

By the early 20th century in Western Canada, grain purchasing, transportation and marketing were controlled by large companies headquartered outside the region, such as the Canadian Pacific Railway and the trading companies that had a significant presence the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. Farmers took note of the success of state-led marketing as it was practised during World War I. The government created a series of boards in and around the war. The Board of Grain Commissioners of 1912 was established for regulation, to supervise grading, etc. By 1915, the government had assumed control of all wheat exports to support the war effort, and by 1917, futures trading on the Winnipeg Exchange was banned. In 1917, the new Board of Grain Supervisors was given exclusive control over wheat and fixed uniform prices across the country. Soon afterwards, the Board took control of the marketing of other crops as well. Farmers expressed concerns that after the war, prices might decline, leading various agrarian groups to lobby Ottawa to keep the Board in place. In response, the government complied by establishing the Canadian Wheat Board for the 1919 crop exclusively. Under this arrangement, farmers received a guaranteed price for that crop, paid promptly, and subsequently received an additional payment once the Board had finalized the year&#x27;s sales. This system of guaranteed prices and distributed income was well received and when the Board dissolved in 1920, many farmers dissented. From 1920 to 1923, prices declined. This marked contrast to the stable prices of 1919–1920. 

=== Interregnum (1920–1935)===

After the dissolution of the early board in 1920, farmers turned to the idea of farmer-owned cooperatives. Cooperative grain elevator operators already existed, like United Grain Growers, which had already been started in 1917. In 1923 and 1924 the wheat pools were created to buy Canadian wheat and resell it overseas. The Alberta Wheat Pool, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, and Manitoba Pool Elevators emerged as significant players in the industry and supplanted the private traders. However, they did not hedge against falling prices, opting for provincial government guarantees instead. During the price collapse of 1929, they faced financial challenges. The majority of farmers opposed the return of private traders, and the prospect of owning their own marketing companies appeared unattainable. Consequently, the concept of a government marketing board was reintroduced.

=== Revival and flourishing (1935–2000)===
The Canadian Wheat Board was re-created in 1935 with the aim of controlling grain prices to benefit farmers devastated by the Great Depression. During the Second World War, the authority of the Board was expanded, and it was granted the authority to set statutory maximums on wheat, oats, barley, flax, and corn from December, 1941 until the end of the war. Membership was mandatory for Western Canadian farmers in 1943 via the War Measures Act, with the new objective of supporting the war effort. In April, 1943 the Board was authorized to buy rapeseed and sunflowers as well.

Between 1958 and 1970, the CWB was chaired by William Craig McNamara. In 1965, MacNamara succeeded in persuading Parliament to eliminate the time limit in the Act, establishing a permanent Board. The CWB&#x27;s authority over interprovincial shipments of feed grains became a matter of public concern during the grains crisis from 1969 to 1972 and was subsequently revoked. Only non-feed wheat and barley remained under the control of the CWB.

=== Anti-GMO stance of the CWB (2004) ===

The Canadian Wheat Board was instrumental in halting the genetically modified (GM) wheat of Monsanto in 2004. Serving as a unified advocate for wheat farmers, the CWB conducted market research that revealed international markets&#x27; reluctance towards GM wheat and their intention to reject wheat exports from Canada if GM wheat was sanctioned, citing contamination risks. Additionally, the CWB surveyed wheat farmers and discovered that many were opposed to GM wheat. Subsequently, the CWB presented its research findings and the perspectives of wheat farmers to the government.

=== Late operations ===

The farmers delivered their wheat and barley to grain elevators throughout the crop year. The Board acted as a single desk marketer of wheat and barley on behalf of prairie farmers. Upon delivery to an elevator, farmers received an initial payment for their grain from the CWB that represented a percentage of the expected return for that grade from the pool account. After the end of the crop year, on July 31, farmers received an interim payment and a final payment, in addition to their initial payment, ensuring they received 100% of the return from the sale of the grain they delivered, minus all overhead costs of the CWB. The initial payments were guaranteed by the Government of Canada, ensuring farmers received payment even in the event of a deficit in the pool account. These initial payments were intentionally set below expectations for the crop year as a risk management measure to mitigate the possibility of unmet price expectations.

Prior to the December 2011 passage of Bill C-18, &quot;An Act to reorganize the Canadian Wheat Board and to make consequential and related amendments to certain Acts&quot;, the CWB was governed by a 15-person Board of Directors, of which:
#Ten of the directors were elected by grain farmers in the western Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and parts of British Columbia;
#Four of the directors were appointed by Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board;
#One was the President of the CWB, appointed by the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board with certain restrictions including that the CWB Board of Directors must be consulted on the recommended candidate.

Upon the implementation of Bill C-18, the original elected board was replaced by four directors, and along with the president, they were appointed by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture.

Until 15 December 2011, compliance with the wheat board was mandatory for most farmers and elevators under threat of punishable by fines and/or imprisonment. Farmers from Eastern Canada and most of British Columbia were not subject to the control of the Canadian Wheat Board and could market all their grain on the open market. The Peace River District in British Columbia was under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Wheat Board. Bill C-18, the Marketing Freedom for Grain Farmers Act, reorganized the CWB to market grain through voluntary pooling. 
==Quality grading system==
Unlike the United States, Canada had a tight grading system established by the Canadian Grain Commission and enforced by the CWB. This enforcement made it &quot;possible to extract premiums for higher quality grain that is not possible in the United States.&quot; In an open market system Western Canadian farmers lose the benefits of a grading system.

===Reorganisation (2006–2012)===

Since 2006 when the Conservative Party came to power, Chuck Strahl, then Minister of Agriculture, worked towards ending the Wheat Board&#x27;s Single Desk. This included replacing government appointees on the Board of Directors with individuals who opposed the board&#x27;s Single Desk, imposing a gag order on Wheat Board staff, dismissing the pro-board President, and intervening in the election of farmer-elected members of the Board of Directors.
* In the December 2006 CWB Board of Directors election, only one of the five farmer-elected seats was won by opponents of the Canadian Wheat Board&#x27;s Single Desk power over the selling of Canadian wheat and barley internationally. With just one incumbent farmer-elected board member opposed to the Single Desk, only two out of the ten farmer-elected directors were against it. Despite this, the government appointed five members to the board, giving supporters of the Single Desk a narrow eight to seven majority. Some have raised doubts about the results due to Minister of Agriculture Strahl removing over 20,000 farmers from the voters list during the election. These farmers were disqualified for reasons such as not having delivered any grain to the Wheat Board in the past two years or not having produced enough wheat or malt barley to generate significant income for their livelihood.
* December 19, 2006: Chuck Strahl dismissed CWB president Adrian Measner, who was a vocal advocate of the Single Desk system. Strahl justified the decision by stating, &quot;It&#x27;s a position that [he] serves at [the] pleasure [of the Minister/Government], and that position was no longer his.&quot; IIt was suggested that Measner had overstepped by refusing to remove pro-CWB documents from the Board website and by appearing at press conferences with opposition leader Stéphane Dion. The majority of the CWB&#x27;s board of directors were against the dismissal of Measner.
* March 28, 2007: Barley Plebiscite. 62% of farmers voted to terminate the wheat board&#x27;s barley Single Desk power. The legislation to amend the act is left unfinished on the order paper when the September 2008 election is called.
* February 26, 2008: The courts rule against the conservative government in a battle over unilaterally dismantling the CWB as it was found to be in violation of the Canadian Wheat Board Act.
* December 7, 2008: In the Board of Directors elections, four out of five candidates elected are in favor of supporting the Single Desk marketing agency.
* January 21, 2010: Supreme Court of Canada ruled in favor of the federal government in its 2006 order prohibiting the board from using its funds for lobbying activities.
* December 7, 2011: Federal Court Judge Douglas Campbell rules that the Conservative government violated the law by introducing legislation to terminate the Wheat Board.
* December 15, 2011: Bill C-18 receives royal assent.
* June 18, 2012: The Federal Court of Appeal upholds Bill C-18.
*August 1, 2012: The end of monopsony takes effect.

===Wheat farmers, railways and CWB===

Ian Robson, whose great-grandfather played a role in initiating the co-operative pool system, contended that as a multi-generational small farmer, he relied on the CWB to counterbalance the influence of the railway. Robson asserts, &quot;We&#x27;re at the mercy of the railways, and the consequences are evident. Transport Canada is tasked with protecting our interests, but they are hesitant to confront the railways.&quot; Before the CWB was sold by the federal government to foreign investors in 2014, the CWB owned 3,375 CWB railway cars. By 2014, CP was shaped by CEO Hunter Harrison and activist shareholder Bill Ackman, both of whom were Americans. In October that same year, Americans owned 73% of CP shares while Canadians and Americans each owned 50% of CN. Western Grain Elevator Association&#x27;s director, Wade Sobkowich, argued that railways were increasing profitability by reducing capacity. At a time when grain farmers are competing with crude oil producers for rail cars, they are not succeeding in getting the rail cars they need.

On September 17, 2014, Transport Minister Lisa Raitt&#x27;s office announced the decision to issue administrative monetary penalties to CN for failing to meet the minimum volume requirements under the Fair Rail for Grain Farmers Act. The penalty could be up to $100,000 per week at the minister&#x27;s discretion, a reduction from the initially proposed daily fine. The adjustment from daily to weekly fines drew criticism from NDP agriculture critic Malcolm Allen and Wade Sobkowich who believed the fines were insufficient to address the rail service issues. Despite reports of potential fines, CN&#x27;s director of communications and public affairs, Mark Hallman, stated that CN had not received any notice of violation or fines. Minister Raitt&#x27;s office indicated that an enforcement officer was assessing the situation to determine if a notice of violation would be issued.

===CWB and tendering process===
In 2006 the four top grain handling companies in Western Canada—Agricore United, Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, Pioneer Grain, and Cargill held nearly 50% of the primary storage capacity. According to University of Saskatchewan professor, Murray Fulton, &quot;This level of concentration, along with a lack of excess capacity&quot; gave grain handling firms market power to raise prices above the cost of providing the service. Since 2001 the CWB encouraged greater competition among the grain companies by &quot;operated a tendering process for approximately 20 to 25 percent of the grain destined for export.&quot; The grain handling companies had to enter competitive bids to the CWB. CWB obtained market power by selecting the best bid as one seller as opposed to a large number of sellers (namely farmers) attempting to negotiate the best price.

====Modern criticism====

Arguments in favour of privatization believe that farmers should be allowed to opt out of the board. Others believe that they could get a better price for their grain than the board and would like to market their own grain. For many Western Canadian farmers, the argument over the CWB Single Desk was about personal freedom—the freedom to market their production of crops in the manner they choose.

The Single Desk control of price and the ability of farmers to deliver wheat and barley created an interest in other crops, causing a surge in acres of canola and pulse crops—crops with no delivery or price controls. This led to a decline in wheat acres and an increase in other crops. Now, with equal delivery opportunity, relative prices are the driving force in making cropping decisions, leading to an appropriate mix of crops based on relative global demand.

Some opponents of the board&#x27;s Single Desk power suggested it should be replaced by a &#x27;dual market&#x27; system. This was presented as a compromise where board supporters could continue to sell their wheat and barley through the board and board opponents could have the option to sell outside the board. From the standpoint of supporters of the board, however, this was not a viable alternative as a dual market would effectively end the board&#x27;s Single Desk power and any perceived benefits that it may have given farmers.

Opponents argue that because the perceived benefits farmers received from the CWB increases their land value, elimination of the CWB Single Desk would lower the value of their land. Lower land prices would make Canadian farmers more competitive but could also leave many owing more than the value of their reduced land. Retiring farmers selling their land could be faced with a much reduced retirement fund but new entrants into farming would be able to purchase land at lower cost. (This is all based on the theory that the CWB provided a net benefit to farmers, which was never proved.)

Some CWB opponents have argued that much of the lower quality land is in close proximity to the US border and would be the first to realize the benefits of the US market.

In a September 2011 plebiscite (referendum) conducted by Meyers Norris Penny, 62% of CWB farmers voted that they wanted to keep the wheat board and its Single Desk power. Proponents of maintaining the CWB stated that the collective bargaining power of the wheat board gives farmers a better price than they would have if they were individually marketing to large multi-national corporations. CWB opponents disagreed, arguing that there was no evidence of better returns for farmers.
At this time, farmers already had the ability to market all the crops save wheat and malt barley independently, meaning it is possible to succeed marketing grain without board oversight. This, however, may make farmers more susceptible to fluctuations in the commodity market and to focus more of their time on the business aspect of farming, rather than farming. The Wheat Board attempted to offer producers more options in its latter years—for example, farmers could sell their wheat with binding forward contracts to the Wheat Board that attempted to pay the same price that they would get for their grain in the U.S.

Supporters of the board and labour unions believed the CWB gave individual farmers increased marketing power in a world market which got them a higher price than they would have otherwise gotten, not only through the efficiencies of scale, but as well by exercising oligopolistic marketing power on the selling side, especially for Durum wheat, although the evidence of this is weak or non-existent. A study conducted in the mid 1990s suggested that farmers gained on average a premium of $13.35 a tonne on wheat as a result of the board&#x27;s Single Desk, although the study and its methodology was widely refuted. Supporters of the Single Desk feared that an end to the board would put farmers in a situation like in the early part of the 20th century where farmers effectively competed with each other to sell their grain, effectively putting them at the mercy of big agribusiness and the railroad monopolies, believing that would reduce farm incomes. The counter-argument is that producers of non-Board crops such as canola do not seem to have this problem.

=====American complaints=====

Although the Board was reformed to meet free market conditions under the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization Treaty, American producers continually complained. Despite numerous challenges and much posturing by the United States, the World Trade Organization ruled in 2003 that the Wheat Board was a producer marketing body and not a system for government subsidy although the decision has since been overturned. In fact, Canadian producers have almost no government subsidy while their American and European Union counterparts are heavily subsidized. 

=====Western alienation=====

The fact that the Wheat Board primarily marketed crops produced in Western Canada became a source of alienation and even Alberta separatism for many Western Canadian farmers. Farmers in Eastern Canada (east of Manitoba) and most of British Columbia (non-Peace River) were exempt from the CWB&#x27;s Single Desk control of non-feed wheat and barley—Ontario has its own marketing board, but it is not compulsory.

=====Calls for abolition of the CWB=====

There had been calls by many groups to abolish the Wheat Board. Many of these groups took their fight to the Internet to spread their message and gain support for their cause. While many were focused on the Canadian Wheat Board, others concentrated on international wheat boards, the other primary target being the Australian Wheat Board, before the AWB itself converted to a private firm, leaving the CWB as the only significant agricultural State Trading Enterprise (STE) exporter worldwide, if one ignores Chinese State-Owned Enterprises (SOE). On 7 December 2008, CWB permit book holders voted in favour of maintaining the wheat board by electing four pro-board candidates with one marketing choice candidate being elected. Stewart Wells, president of the National Farmers Union, said &quot;The message can&#x27;t be any clearer&quot;. Others argued that the voter&#x27;s list was flawed, as it included many small or part-time producers who may not deliver to the Board, as well as non-producers such as landowners whose livelihood might not solely rely on farming.
In December 2008, the draft modalities text of the Doha Development Round was revised such that upon signing in its revised form, the CWB would lose statutory privileges such as the Single Desk within five years of the signing.

===Transfer of CWB to Foreign Hands (2012–2015)===
One of the aims of the Conservative government since coming to power in January 2006 was to end the Single Desk marketing power on Western Canadian wheat and barley. The Conservatives had been unable to get this change approved by Parliament because they held a minority of seats until the May 2011 federal election and all opposition parties supported the Single Desk. The Conservatives also lost a court battle to unilaterally dismantle the CWB without an act of Parliament. In the aftermath, Harper and then Minister of Agriculture Chuck Strahl stated their intent to continue with the removal of the traditional role of the CWB, particularly in regards to barley (which is generally a more corporate crop), perhaps through Parliamentary action.

After winning a majority in the May 2011 general election, the Conservative government announced its intention to remove the CWB Single Desk through legislation. In response, the CWB held plebiscites on whether to keep the Single Desk power on wheat and barley. The results were released on September 12, 2011; 51 percent of barley growers and 62 percent of wheat growers voted to maintain the board&#x27;s Single Desk. Notwithstanding, the government removed the Single Desk on August 1, 2012 ignoring the plebiscites&#x27; results. In defending this policy, Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz claimed the CWB plebiscites were seriously flawed and that the Conservatives&#x27; election victory gave them a mandate to remove the Single Desk.

According to the CWB, the government advanced the timetables to Christmas 2011, prompting them to launch a protest campaign urging Canadians as well as farmers to speak out against the government&#x27;s decision to end the Single Desk. Meanwhile, the government issued leaflets explaining what would &quot;bring marketing freedom.&quot;

The Marketing Freedom for Grain Farmers Act instituted a timeline for the eventual privatization of CWB, requiring the board to formulate a plan by 2016, to be implemented in 2017. On April 15, 2015, it was announced that a 50.1% majority stake in CWB would be acquired by Global Grain Group, a joint venture between Bunge Canada—a subsidiary of Bunge Limited, and SALIC Canada—a subsidiary of the Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Company, for $250 million. The remaining equity of CWB will be held by its member farmers.

The sale to G3 took place while a &quot;Farmers of North America&quot; led group of Western Canadian farmers attempted to raise funds to purchase the CWB and keep it Canadian farmer owned rather than selling it to foreign corporations. The group was rebuffed despite having a higher offer, ($349 million?) on grounds that they had not raised the funds. (the time frame was artificially short for the kind of offer FNA was attempting).

On 12 June 2015, the Department of Finance released draft legislation to handle the tax consequence to farmers, and to the Trust which will hold 49.9% of CWB in trust for farmers (proposed section 135.2 of the Income Tax Act). No news release was issued to explain the legislation. An explanation of how the legislation works is included in the 48th edition of Carswell&#x27;s Practitioner&#x27;s Income Tax Act and Carswell&#x27;s Taxnet Pro.

<doc id="526506" wikidata="Q135815" url="?curid=526506" title="Z. Z. Hill">
<text>Arzell J. &quot;Z. Z.&quot; Hill (September 30, 1935 – April 27, 1984) was an American blues singer best known for his recordings in the 1970s and early 1980s, including his 1982 album for Malaco Records, &quot;Down Home&quot;, which stayed on the Billboard soul album chart for nearly two years. The track &quot;Down Home Blues&quot; has been called the best-known blues song of the 1980s. According to the Texas State Historical Association, Hill &quot;devised a combination of blues and contemporary soul styling and helped to restore the blues to modern black consciousness.&quot;

==Early life==
Hill was born in Naples, Texas. 

==Career==
Hill began his singing career in the late 1950s as part of a gospel group the Spiritual Five, touring Texas. He was influenced by Sam Cooke, B. B. King, and Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland. He began performing his own songs and others in clubs in and around Dallas, including stints fronting bands led by Bo Thomas and Frank Shelton. He took his stage name in emulation of B. B. King.

Encouraged by Otis Redding, who had seen him perform, he joined his older brother Matt Hill, a budding record producer, in Los Angeles in 1963, and released his first single, &quot;You Were Wrong&quot;, on the family&#x27;s M.H. label. It spent one week at number 100 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1964, and Hill was quickly signed by Kent Records. Most of the songs he recorded for Kent were written or co-written by Hill and arranged by the prominent saxophonist Maxwell Davis. None charted; in retrospect, however, many, such as &quot;I Need Someone (To Love Me)&quot;, are now viewed with high regard by fans of soul music.

After leaving Kent in 1968, he recorded briefly for Phil Walden&#x27;s Capricorn label, based in Macon, Georgia, but after a disagreement with Walden his recording contract was bought by Jerry &quot;Swamp Dogg&quot; Williams&#x27; Mankind label, where Hill fulfilled his end of the deal. He returned to California to record for his brother&#x27;s label, Hill, and the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Pay for His Mistakes&quot;, produced by Matt Hill and Miles Grayson, became his biggest pop hit, reaching number 62 on the Hot 100. The Kent label reissued his 1964 recording of &quot;I Need Someone&quot;, which also charted. Williams also recorded Hill in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, in 1971, resulting in several R&amp;B hits, including &quot;Chokin&#x27; Kind&quot; and &quot;It Ain&#x27;t No Use&quot;, as well as the LP &quot;The Brand New Z. Z. Hill&quot;.

With his brother&#x27;s help, Hill then signed with United Artists, where he was aided by arrangements and compositions by established R&amp;B talents including Lamont Dozier and Allen Toussaint, and released several singles that made the R&amp;B chart in the mid 1970s. After his brother Matt&#x27;s sudden death from a heart attack, Z. Z. Hill left United Artists and signed with Columbia Records, recording two albums with leading arranger-producer Bert de Coteaux in New York. Several singles taken from the albums charted, including &quot;Love Is So Good When You&#x27;re Stealing It&quot;, which spent 18 weeks on the Billboard R&amp;B chart in the summer of 1977.

In 1979, he left Columbia and returned south, signing for Malaco Records, a move which, according to Allmusic writer Bill Dahl, &quot;managed to resuscitate both his own semi-flagging career and the entire [blues] genre at large&quot;. His first hit for the label was his recording of &quot;Cheating in the Next Room,&quot; written by George Jackson, which was released in early 1982 and reached the R&amp;B top 20, spending a total of 20 weeks on the chart. He had a number of best-selling albums for Malaco, the biggest being &quot;Down Home&quot;, which stayed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; soul album chart for nearly two years. The song &quot;Down Home Blues&quot;, also written by Jackson, was later recorded by labelmate Denise LaSalle. Hill&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Rhythm &amp; the Blues&quot;, released in 1982, was also received with critical acclaim, and its success contributed to the subsequent boom in blues music, much of it recorded by the Malaco label, in Jackson, Mississippi.

==Personal life and death ==
While touring in February 1984, Hill was involved in a car crash. He gave his final performance two months later, on April 23, at the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas. On April 27, he died of a heart attack arising from a blood clot in his leg that formed after the accident. Malaco Records producer Gerald &quot;Wolf&quot; Stephenson told reporters that a friend found Hill lying in the driveway of his home in Dallas; he was pronounced dead at Charlton Methodist Hospital after attempts to resuscitate him failed.

==Legacy==
Hill&#x27;s song &quot;That Ain&#x27;t the Way You Make Love&quot; was sampled by Madvillain in their track &quot;Fancy Clown.&quot;

Hill is the subject of Angela Jackson&#x27;s poem &quot;One Night ZZ Hill Sang at the Club Tupelo.&quot;

The band ZZ Top is named in his honor.

<text>Orval Abbey (Abbaye Notre-Dame d&#x27;Orval) is a Cistercian monastery founded in 1132 in the Gaume region of Belgium, located in Villers-devant-Orval, part of Florenville, Wallonia in the province of Luxembourg. The abbey is well known for its history and spiritual life but also for its local production of the Trappist beer Orval and a specific cheese.

== History ==
=== First foundation ===
The site has been occupied since the Merovingian period, and there is evidence that there was already a chapel here in the 10th century. Around 1070, a group of Benedictine monks from Calabria settled here, at the invitation of Arnold I, Count of Chiny, and Conrad I, Count of Luxembourg, and began construction of a church and a monastery, but after some forty years, possibly because of the death of Count Arnould, they moved away again. They were replaced by a community of Canons Regular, who completed the construction work: the abbey church was consecrated on 30 September 1124.

In 1132, a group of Cistercian monks from Trois-Fontaines Abbey in Champagne arrived, and the two groups formed a single community within the Cistercian Order, under the first abbot, Constantin.

Around 1252, the monastery was destroyed by a fire; the rebuilding took around 100 years. Wenceslaus I was buried here in 1383.
In the literary field the monks of Orval did not much distinguish themselves. The only noteworthy writer was Aegidius or Gilles d&#x27;Orval, who lived in the first half of the thirteenth century. He wrote the continuation, to the year 1251, of the &quot;Gesta Pontificum Leodiensium&quot;, which had been written up to the year 1048 by Heriger of Lobbes and Anselm of Liège.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, the various wars between France and various neighbouring regions (Burgundy, Spain) had an important impact on Orval. At one stage a foundry was established on the site. In 1637, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the abbey was pillaged and burnt by French mercenaries.

In the 17th century, the abbey converted to the Trappist branch of the Cistercian order, but reverted to the Rule of the main order in around 1785. In 1793, during the French Revolution, the abbey was completely burnt down by French forces, in retaliation for the hospitality it had provided to Austrian troops, and the community forcibly dispersed.

=== Second foundation ===
In 1887, the land and ruins were acquired by the Harenne family. They donated the lands to the Cistercian order in 1926 so that monastic life could resume on the site. Between 1926 and 1948, under the direction of the Trappist monk Marie-Albert van der Cruyssen, the new monastery was constructed, and in 1936 Orval regained the rank of abbey. On 8 September 1948, the new church was consecrated. The abbey has many artifacts designed and produced by Camille Colruyt.

The medieval tradition of brewing beer at the Abbey was revived in 1931 to generate funds for the rebuilding. The ruins of the medieval buildings remain on the site and are available to view.

== The legend of Orval ==
There is a legend of the abbey&#x27;s foundation, purporting to explain the name &#x27;&quot;Orval&quot; and the coat of arms. According to this, the widowed Mathilda of Tuscany was visiting the site, when she lost her wedding ring in a spring, to her great distress. When she prayed for the return of the ring, a trout appeared on the surface of the water with the ring in its mouth. She exclaimed &quot;Truly this place is a &quot;Val d&#x27;Or&quot; (Golden Valley)&quot;, from which the name &quot;Orval&quot; is derived, and in gratitude made available the funds for the foundation of the monastery here. The abbey arms show the trout and ring. The spring still supplies water to the monastery and its brewery.

<doc id="526517" wikidata="Q18277" url="?curid=526517" title="Canton 10">
<text>Canton 10 (, , , ) is one of the ten cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a political entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is the largest canton by area and eighth by population. The local government seat is in Livno, while the assembly is in Tomislavgrad. It is divided into five municipalities: Bosansko Grahovo, Drvar, Glamoč, Kupres, Tomislavgrad and one city, Livno.

The canton was established in 1996, following the Washington Agreement of 1994, which ended the Croat-Bosniak War. The majority of the population is ethnically Croat, living in the southern part of the canton, while the second-largest Serbs live in the northern part.

During the Bosnian War, the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) controlled the southern parts of the canton, while other parts, mostly in the north, were controlled by the Serb Army of Republika Srpska until 1994 when they were re-taken by the HVO with the support from the Croatian Army. Per the Washington Agreement, the territories were incorporated into the Croat-Bosniak Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. From 1996 to 2005, only Croats and Bosniaks were considered to be constituent nations within the canton, but since 2005, the Serbs are included among the constituent nations as well and are mentioned as such before the less numerous Bosniaks.

== Name, symbols and language ==

In Croatian, the term &quot;županija&quot; is used, while in Serbian and Bosnian, the term is &quot;kanton&quot;. The canton is officially referred to by the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as Canton 10 ( or &quot;Županija 10&quot;). The local government refers to it as the Herzeg-Bosnia County and uses that name in the local constitution. This name was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of the Federation because the name is a characteristic shared by all the cantons in the sense that all of them are within Bosnia and Herzegovina. Other names used at the national level include North Herzegovina Canton (, ) and Livno Canton (&quot;Livanjski kanton&quot;), after its capital.

The coat of arms of the canton under its constitution is a variant of the historical Croatian coat of arms. The flag is a horizontal tricolour of red, white and blue, with the coat of arms in the middle. These symbols were used by the former Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia. The West Herzegovina Canton also uses this flag and coat of arms. Their use as the official symbols of the canton was deemed unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of the Federation, because &quot;they only represented one constituent nation&quot;. The local government continues to use the flag and the coat of arms at plates at the official institutions.

Since 2005, the constitution lists the &quot;languages spoken by Croats, Serbs and Bosniaks&quot; as the official languages, without naming them, with both the Latin and the Cyrillic script having equal status.

== History ==
Originally occupied by the Dalmatae, the area of Canton 10 was annexed in 15 AD by the Roman Empire and formed part of the Roman province of Dalmatia. After the introduction of Christianity, Delminium (Tomislavgrad) is the seat of the bishopric.

These years also see the creation of the city of Livno. The first written appearance of the name of Livno was in 892 when it was mentioned as a seat of one of the counties of the Kingdom of Croatia. The region was attached in the ninth century to the Kingdom of the Croats and later in the 14th century to the Kingdom of Bosnia. After the death of the king of Bosnia, Tvrtko I in 1391, the power of the Kingdom of Bosnia gradually declined and the region was taken over by the Kingdom of Croatia, the state associated with the Kingdom of Hungary by a personal union.

In the 16th century, the region was fully integrated for four centuries within the Ottoman Empire. Under the Ottoman Empire, peasants who remained Catholic or Orthodox were hostile to Turkish officials and Islamised landowners.

In the nineteenth century, several uprisings and rebellions against Muslim authorities erupted in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Suffering under oppression by the authorities and furious after the Muslim authorities had killed the Catholic spiritual leader of this region, Lovro Karaula, Franciscan priest, the Catholics of Livno rose up against Ottoman rule on July 20, 1875. Soon, the Catholics from across the region joined this uprising. The rebel leaders were two Franciscan priests, Stjepan Krešić and Bonaventura Šarić-Drženjak. For three years, the insurgency controlled the mountainous regions of Glamoč, Livno, Kupres and Grahovo. When the Austrian army arrived in the Livno region in 1878, the insurgents handed over their arms to the Austrians. The Austro-Hungarian troops met in this region an opposition, both of the Muslim population and the Orthodox population, fighting battles in the vicinity of Livno. The region was liberated at the end of the summer of 1878.

Austria-Hungary occupied the region militarily and Bosnia and Herzegovina after 1878 Berlin Congress. This period is marked by industrialization and Westernization. Architecturally, many public buildings were built and many Catholic religious buildings were erected that were banned during the Ottoman era.

After World War I, the area of Herzeg-Bosnia county was in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later Yugoslavia. Most of the present-day area of Herzeg-Bosnia County belonged to the then-Travnik area in 1922, while the smaller northern parts belonged to the Bišćan area. After the introduction of the January 6 dictatorship and the division of the state into &quot;banovinas&quot; in 1929, most of the Croatian areas of Herzeg-Bosnia county became part of Primorska banovina with headquarters in Split, while the northern Serbian areas were annexed to Vrbas banovina, with headquarters in Banja Luka. With the creation of Croatian Banovina in 1939, all of Primorska Banovina became part of it, including the majority of Croat areas of Canton 10.

After the creation of the NDH and its administrative division, most of the area of today&#x27;s Herzeg-Bosnia County was part of the Great Parish of Pliva and Rama with its seat in Jajce, while the smaller northern part belonged to the Great Parish of Krbava and Psata with its seat in Bihać. After the defeat of the Axis powers in 1945, the area of Herzeg-Bosnia County became part of the then-federal unit of SFR Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the democratic process, most of the Croatian municipalities in the county, Kupres, Livno and Tomislavgrad, became part of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia.

With the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the northern and western part of Herzeg-Bosnia County under the leadership of the SDS, the Serb majority areas sided with the Army of Republika Srpska killing Croats and Bosniaks in Drvar, Grahovo, Glamoč, attacking Kupres and shelling Livno and surrounding settlements. After the formation of HVO military units, first, the Kupres area was liberated. Croats and Bosniaks formed the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina through the Washington Agreement, which included the entire area of Herzeg-Bosnia County under HVO control, and a little later, in the summer of 1995, HVO and HV defeated Serb forces decisively. They attacked and captured Grahovo, Glamoč and Drvar, which, together with other victories of the HVO, HV and the RBiH Army, created the conditions for the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement. After the war, Herzeg-Bosnia was self-abolished in 1996 and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was organized into counties. Herzeg-Bosnia County was the largest county in FBiH when it was created.

The Constitution of Herzeg-Bosnia Canton was adopted by the Cantonal Assembly on 19 December 1996.

== Geography ==
The total area of the canton is approximately , a tenth of the surface of Bosnia-Herzegovina and c. 19% of the Federation. The region is located between Dalmatia to the west, Una-Sana Canton to the north, Central Bosnia Canton to the east and West Herzegovina Canton and Herzegovina-Neretva Canton to the south and southeast.

The natural and geographical features of this area are diverse, ranging from fertile and vast fields and vast pastures, rivers and lakes to centuries-old deciduous and evergreen forests, and provide abundant opportunities for life and economic development based on agricultural production, livestock and the timber industry. The ecologically clean and unspoiled nature, the mild continental climate, the geographical position and the proximity and good transport connections with neighboring Croatia, i.e. its gateway to the world, Central Dalmatia, and the connection with the whole of Herzegovina, are important factors for economic progress in this area.

===Topography===
The mountainous terrain of the region is a part of the Dinaric Alps, linked from a fold and thrust belt dating from the late Jurassic period, itself part of the Alpine orogeny, extending southeast from the southern Alps. The Dinarides form part of a chain of mountains that stretch across southern Europe and isolate Pannonian Basin from the Mediterranean Sea. The highest mountain of the Tropolje Dinarides is Mount Vran, located on the border of the municipalities of Tomislavgrad and Jablanica with the peak called Veliki Vran (&quot;Great Vran&quot;) at .
== Political subdivisions ==

Canton 10 includes five municipalities: Drvar, Bosansko Grahovo, Glamoč, Kupres, and Tomislavgrad and one township: Livno.
== Governance ==

The canton is governed by the Government of Canton 10 (; ; ). The current government is a coalition led by the Croatian National Shift. 

=== Government ===

The Government of the Canton 10 is led by the prime minister who has one deputy and it consists of seven ministries. The ministries have different seats, with two ministries being seated in Tomislavgrad, and the rest in Livno.

=== Cantonal Assembly ===

The Cantonal Assembly (, Bosnian and ) is the parliament of the Canton 10. It consists of 25 representatives elected by proportional representation for four-year terms of office.
==Demographics==

According to the 1991 census, 115.682 people inhabited the canton. Croats comprised 51.5%, Serbs comprised 35.7% and Bosnian Muslims comprised 10.4% of the population. Croats overwhelmingly lived in the southeastern part of the canton (Livno, Kupres, Tomislavgrad), while Serbs lived in northwestern (Grahovo, Glamoč, Drvar). There was a significant population migration during the war (1992–95). In 1992, Serb forces captured Kupres and the surrounding area, pushing away most of the non-Serb population. Croats returned at the end of 1994, after their forces have retaken Kupres. After Croat forces captured Grahovo, Glamoč and Drvar in the summer and fall of 1995, 12,000 to 14,000 Serbs fled to Banja Luka. Refugee Croats from other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina (fleeing Serb or Bosniak forces) settled in the abandoned area previously inhabited by the Serbs. After the war, under UN and peace implementation forces&#x27; pressure, Serb refugees returned to their homes.

In 2013, Canton&#x27;s population included approximately 77% Croats, 13% Serbs and 9.6% Bosniaks; all other ethnicities combined made up the remaining &lt;0.4%. Canton 10 had the largest share of ethnic Serbs in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, their number has steadily decreased since the conclusion of the Bosnian War.

=== 1991 Census ===
=== 2013 Census ===
==Economy==

The canton has significant natural resources, with large reserves of coal and timber, as well as hydro &amp; wind power. Due to economic reasons (insufficient canton revenues compared to expenses) unification with West Herzegovina Canton has been proposed.

The pre-war economic recession, and certainly the war in this area, caused significant population fluctuations in the form of emigration to Western European countries or relocation to other areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The natural and geographical features of this area are diverse, from fertile and vast fields and vast pastures, rivers and lakes to centuries-old deciduous and evergreen forests, and provide abundant opportunities for life and economic development based on agricultural production, livestock and the timber industry. The ecologically clean and intact nature, the temperate continental climate, the geographical position and the proximity and good transport connections with other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina and neighboring Croatia, especially Dalmatia, which traditionally and economically gravitate, are important factors for the economic development of this area. The canton suffered severe damage during the last war and is one of the worst affected areas in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The rebuilding process is slow and difficult, but the economy is already showing signs of recovery, mainly visible in the construction, wood processing industry, small business and handicrafts segment. Although commerce is still the dominant branch of the economy, in terms of the total number of companies (191 or 44.50% of the total of 429 active companies and 30% of total income).

Viewed from the revenue aspect of 1998 and 1999, there was a significant increase in construction, agriculture and forestry, as well as transportation, industry and mining. Commerce registered a decrease in income compared to 1998 by 2 index points, as well as a decrease in the participation in total income at the cantonal level from 44.80% in 1998 to 30% in 1999 in favor of other productive activities, and especially construction agriculture and forestry, especially if we take into account that the total income generated at the cantonal level in 1999 increased by 25% compared to 1998. All these are positive indicators of economic recovery and the basis of the expected future development.

The main economic branches of Canton 10 according to the number of employees are the wholesale and retail trade, the processing industry and agriculture, forestry and fishing.

The average salary in Canton 10 is 1168 KM (2024). The highest average net salary is paid in Livno (1269 KM) and the lowest in Drvar (928 KM).

<text>Walter Cox-Smith Weir (June 7, 1929 – April 17, 1985) was a Canadian politician. Weir served as the 15th premier of Manitoba from 1967 to 1969.

== Personal life ==
The son of James Dixon Weir, Walter Weir was born in Hugh Bluff, Manitoba and was educated there and in the City of Portage la Prairie. Weir worked as an undertaker in Saskatchewan, later returning to Manitoba where he became the owner of his own funeral home in Minnedosa in 1953. In 1951, he married Harriet Thompson.

Weir served as chairman of the Minnedosa Hospital Board from 1955 to 1957, and of the Minnedosa Town Council from 1958 to 1959.

Weir died in the evening of April 17, 1985 of a suspected heart attack at his home in Minnedosa, Manitoba.

== Political career ==
He sought the Progressive Conservative nomination for the rural riding of Minnedosa in the buildup to the 1958 provincial election, but lost to Sid Paler. He later defeated Paler for the party&#x27;s nomination in the buildup to the 1959 provincial election; there was no lasting animosity between the candidates, and Paler served as Weir&#x27;s campaign manager in the election that followed.

Weir was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in Dufferin Roblin&#x27;s landslide victory of 1959, defeating Liberal-Progressive incumbent Charles Shuttleworth in Minnedosa. He was appointed Minister of Municipal Affairs on October 25, 1961, holding the portfolio until February 27, 1963. Weir was also Minister of Public Works from November 5, 1962 to July 22, 1967 and Minister of Highways from July 1, 1967 to November 27, 1967. He was re-elected without difficulty in 1962, and again by a credible margin in the provincial election of 1966.

When Roblin moved to federal politics in 1967, Weir defeated Sterling Lyon and two other candidates to become the party&#x27;s new leader. He was sworn in as Premier on November 27, 1967.

Weir represented a &quot;rural populist&quot; wing within the Manitoba Tories, and spoke for the party&#x27;s more conservative members who had been marginalized during Red Tory Roblin&#x27;s time as leader. Weir&#x27;s government kept spending increases to a minimum and introduced a balanced budget without tax increases in 1968. Weir was skeptical toward the concept of Medicare, and his government did not sign on to the program until 1969, one year after its introduction. He also opposed the introduction of official bilingualism and attained national notoriety for his conflict with Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau over that issue.

Weir also proposed reforms for the Senate of Canada. He called for all provinces to have an equal number of senators and for some Senate representatives to be appointed on the recommendation of provincial governments. He also recommended for the Senate to be given more powers, including the authority to ratify international treaties.

Weir called four by-elections in early 1969, largely to test his government&#x27;s popularity on the bilingualism issue. Tory candidates were successful in three of those contests, and it appeared as if his government&#x27;s stance had been vindicated. Weir called a general election for June 25, 1969, even though only three years had passed since the previous election.

That turned out to be a strategic error, particularly after the New Democratic Party selected Edward Schreyer as its leader during the campaign. Schreyer was a youthful and charismatic figure from the centrist wing of the NDP, and his party was able to win the support of many centre-left voters, including those who had voted for Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s federal Liberals the previous year. The NDP won 28 seats against 22 for the Tories. On election night, Weir told his supporters, &quot;The people have spoken. And the people are wrong.&quot;

While the NDP came up one seat short of a majority, it was not immediately clear who would form government. Weir initially flirted with supporting a coalition with the Manitoba Liberals in which former Liberal leader Gildas Molgat, despite his party finishing in third place, would have become Premier. However, that came undone when Liberal MLA Laurent Desjardins threw his support to the NDP, which allowed Schreyer to replace Weir as Premier shortly thereafter.

Weir stepped down as PC leader in February 1971, and retired as an MLA in September of the same year. He did not re-enter political life again.

<doc id="526523" wikidata="Q756106" url="?curid=526523" title="Manicouagan Reservoir">
<text>Manicouagan Reservoir (also Lake Manicouagan ; ) is an annular lake in central Quebec, Canada, covering an area of . The lake island in its centre is known as René-Levasseur Island, and its highest point is Mount Babel. The structure was created 214 (±1) million years ago, in the Late Triassic, by the impact of a meteorite in diameter. The lake and island are clearly seen from space and are sometimes called the &quot;eye of Quebec&quot;. The lake has a volume of .

==Geography==

The reservoir is located in Manicouagan Regional County Municipality in the Côte-Nord region of Quebec, Canada, about north of the city of Baie-Comeau, although its northernmost part is located in Caniapiscau Regional County Municipality. Quebec Route 389 passes the eastern shore of the lake.

The crater is a multiple-ring structure about across, with the reservoir at its diameter inner ring being its most prominent feature. It surrounds an inner island plateau called René-Levasseur Island and Mount Babel is the highest peak of the island, at above sea level and above the reservoir level. The Louis-Babel Ecological Reserve makes up the central part of the island.

==Impact structure==

Manicouagan Reservoir lies within the remnant of an ancient, deeply eroded impact crater (Impact structure). The crater was formed following the impact of an asteroid with a diameter of , which excavated a crater originally about wide, although erosion and deposition of sediments have since reduced the visible diameter to about . It is the Earth&#x27;s sixth-largest confirmed impact structure according to rim-to-rim diameter. Mount Babel is interpreted as the central peak of the crater, formed by post-impact uplift.

1992 radiometric dating has estimated that impact melt within the impact structure has an age of 214 ± 1 million years. A later estimate found an age of 215.4 ± 0.16 Ma. As this is more than 12 million years before the end of the Triassic, the impact that produced the crater cannot have been the cause of the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event.

=== Multiple impact event claims ===
It was suggested that the Manicouagan crater may have been part of a multiple impact event, similar to the well observed string of impacts of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 on Jupiter in 1994. The theory suggests this event also formed the Rochechouart impact structure in France, the Saint Martin crater in Manitoba, the Obolon&#x27; crater in Ukraine, and the Red Wing crater in North Dakota; however, more recent work has found that the craters formed many millions of years apart, with the Saint Martin crater dating to 227.8 ± 1.1 Ma. While the Rochechouart structure formed 206.92 ± 0.20/0.32 Ma.

== Hydroelectric project ==

The Manicouagan Reservoir as it presently exists was created in the 1960s, by flooding the earlier Lake Mushalagan (Mouchalagan) to the west of the central plateau and then-smaller Manicouagan to the east, by construction of the Daniel-Johnson dam. The works were part of the enormous Manicouagan or Manic series of hydroelectric projects undertaken by Hydro-Québec, the provincial electrical utility. The complex of dams is also called the Manic-Outardes Project because the rivers involved are the Manicouagan and the Outardes.

The reservoir acts as a giant headpond for the Manicouagan River, feeding the Jean-Lesage generating station (Manic-2), René-Lévesque generating station (Manic-3), and Daniel-Johnson Dam (Manic-5) generating stations downstream. In the peak period of the winter cold, the lake surface is usually lower, since the turbines run all the time at peak load to meet the huge electrical heating needs of the province. The surface of the lake also experiences low levels in the extreme periods of heat in New England during the summer, since in that period Hydro-Québec sells electrical energy to the joint New England grid and individual utilities in the United States.

<text>Adrian Stoop (27 March 1883 – 27 November 1957) was an English rugby union player of Dutch descent.

He played 182 times for Harlequins between 1901 and 1939, and won 15 caps for England.

He was president of the Harlequins 1920–1949. The club&#x27;s ground, The Stoop, is named in his memory. 

His association with Harlequins lasted from his debut against Oxford University in November 1901 until 1950 when he ended his 30-year stint as president of the club. He played his last game in Quins colours in 1939, at the age of 56. He made 182 appearances in total, captained the side 143 times and scored 86 tries, being club captain for 8 consecutive seasons from 1906/07 to 1913/14.

Stoop was born on 27 March 1883 in Cromwell Road, London. His father was Dutch and his mother was half Scottish/half Irish. He went to Dover College in 1896 and on to Rugby School in 1898, where he played for the school team, and then to Oxford University, where he was captain of the rugby team in 1904.

It was whilst he was still at Rugby school that he was asked to join Harlequins. He had also been approached by Blackheath, who at the time were a bigger name than Quins, but he decided to accept the offer from Quins.

In 1905, Stoop made his debut for England against Scotland and it was also against Scotland that he earned the last of his 15 caps in 1912. During this time he captained the national side twice, including the first ever international played at Twickenham in 1910. Had it not been for a broken collarbone in 1907 he would have added to his international appearances.

Stoop is widely credited with revolutionising back play. Previously, the two half backs were designated as &quot;left and right&quot;, but Stoop incorporated ideas already being used in Wales and New Zealand to introduce the concept of the Scrum Half and Fly Half. He used these ideas to great success for both Harlequins and England.

As well as being club captain from 1906 to 1914, Stoop was secretary from 1905 to 1914 and from 1920 to 1938 as well as president from 1920 to 1950. He was also president of the RFU in 1932 and was a member of the selection committee. In addition to Quins and England he also represented Oxford University, Surrey and The Barbarians.

He was keen beekeeper and ornithologist.

He died on 27 November 1957, aged 74. He is buried at Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, where he had lived for many years.

<doc id="526533" wikidata="Q3521326" url="?curid=526533" title="The Human Beinz">
<text>The Human Beinz ( ) is an American rock band from Youngstown, Ohio. Originally known as The Premiers, the band initially featured John Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Belley (vocals, guitar), Joe &quot;Ting&quot; Markulin (vocals, guitar), Mel Pachuta (vocals, bass), and Gary Coates (drums), later replaced by Mike Tatman.

Their only hit record in the US, &quot;Nobody But Me&quot;, peaked in 1968 at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Early career==
The Beinz started in 1964 as The Premiers, launching their professional career to build a local fan base. 
In 1966, they changed their name to The Human Beingz because they felt their old name did not fit with the feel of the late 1960s. They recorded covers of songs by Them, The Yardbirds, The Who and Bob Dylan. The group was also the first to record a cover of &quot;Gloria&quot; by Them, which became a hit for The Shadows of Knight, and covered &quot;The Pied Piper&quot;, which later became a hit for Crispian St. Peters.

The group signed to Capitol Records in 1967 and at that time Capitol misspelled their name, leaving out the &quot;g&quot;. 
Capitol&#x27;s purported idea was to affiliate the band&#x27;s name with the Human Be-In movement of 1967.

The Beingz were told it would be changed on the next release if the debut single did not have any success. On 24 August 1967 &quot;Nobody But Me&quot; was released and became their only &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 hit, which meant that Capitol would not correct the spelling. &quot;Nobody But Me&quot; (written and first recorded by The Isley Brothers in 1962) peaked at No. 8 in February 1968. The recording&#x27;s two 31-fold repetitions of the word &quot;no&quot; fulfill Casey Kasem&#x27;s &quot;Book of Records&quot; category of most repetitive word or phrase in a Hot 100 top 10 hit, besting the 26-fold repetition of &quot;I know&quot; in Bill Withers&#x27; &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot;. An album, &quot;Nobody But Me&quot;, followed.

The Beinz&#x27; next single, &quot;Turn On Your Love Light&quot;, peaked No. 80 but became a huge hit in Japan, where it peaked at No. 1.&quot;Turn On Your Love Light&quot;, originally a hit for Bobby Bland in 1962, was later covered by Jerry Lee Lewis and the Grateful Dead. In 1968, Capitol released a second album, &quot;Evolutions&quot;. They also released the single, &quot;Hold on Baby&quot;, exclusively in Japan, where it also hit the top of the charts. The band underwent a contractually obligated tour of Japan as a result of their success there and broke up immediately thereafter in March 1969.

==Revival==
In 2003, The Human Beinz were among the bands featured in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame exhibit Hang on Sloopy: The Music of Ohio. On display were a white Fender bass used by Mel Pachuta and a black Edwardian jacket worn by Ting Markulin.

In 2004, Quentin Tarantino used &quot;Nobody But Me&quot; in his film &quot;Kill Bill: Vol. 1&quot;, although it did not appear on the movie soundtrack. The same song was on two compilation albums: &quot;ESPN&#x27;s The Greatest Crowd-Rockin&#x27; Anthems of All Time&quot; and &quot;J&amp;R Music World Presents Rock and Roll&#x27;s Greatest Hits of All Time&quot;. The song made yet another appearance in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 2006 film &quot;The Departed&quot;. It was also featured in the seventh-season premiere of the American comedy television series, &quot;The Office&quot;. In 2018, the song was used in Andrés Spinova&#x27;s novel &quot;Marilyn y un Par de Ases&quot;, playing during a killer bees chase. Other uses of &quot;Nobody But Me&quot; are: 
* &quot;Limitless&quot; (performer)-1 episode - &quot;Headquarters!&quot; - 2015
* &quot;Glee&quot; (performer)-1 episode - &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; - 2013
* &quot;&quot; - 2001
* &quot;Malekat el leil&quot; (film) (Arabic-English translation: &quot;Queen of the Night&quot;) - 1971
* It is featured in episode one of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;This Is Going to Hurt&quot;.

The new lineup of the Human Beinz played the Hard Rock Cafe at Foxwoods Casino, Bodles Opera House, county fairs and other venues in the Northeast. The group featured their original leader Ting Markulin in 2007. The group wrote and recorded two songs, &quot;McQ&quot; (E. McCarthy, S. Crisafi) and &quot;Coyotes &amp; Rattlesnakes&quot; (R. Iacovelli), for &quot;McQueen: An American Rebel&quot; (2007). The world premiere and gala were held at the Downing Film Center in Newburgh, New York. The Human Beinz with Markulin were in attendance, as were Barbara McQueen and author Marshall Terrill.

Joseph &quot;Ting&quot; Markulin lives in Florida. The Human Beinz worked on an album of originals and 1960s cover songs in Pennsylvania in May 2010. This effort was shelved and never released to the public. They appeared in concert at The Dome SUNY Binghamton Events Center in Binghamton, New York, in concert with Jay and The Americans and The Vogues, on May 8, 2010. On July 31, 2010, they appeared at Weekend of 100 Rock Stars, as part of the Nat Rock Con Fan Fest at the Sheraton Meadowlands in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Some of the group performed &quot;Nobody but Me&quot; live at a jam session show on July 31, 2010, at the Nat Rock Con Fan Fest with Danny and the Characters and Vince Martell of Vanilla Fudge.

Revival band members include Ting Markulin (rhythm guitar and vocals), Gene Szegedi (lead guitar), Sal Crisafi (keyboards, guitar and vocals), Ed McCarthy (bass), Rick White (lead vocals and percussion) and Mike Cerra (drums and percussion). The album &quot;Garage Days Volume 1&quot; was released on Fuel 2000 records in 2011.

Barry Manilow was born Barry Alan Pincus on June 17, 1943, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, the son of Edna Manilow and Harold Kelliher, a truck driver of Irish descent. Barry&#x27;s mother made his father change his name to Pincus, which was the name of a Jewish uncle of his father from the 1800s. Barry&#x27;s parents were divorced when he was a baby, and his mother&#x27;s Jewish family allowed no further contact between Barry and his father. Barry&#x27;s maternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants, and his paternal grandfather was Jewish, though his grandmother was a Catholic of Irish descent. His Irish roots trace back to Limerick, Ireland. Barry&#x27;s grandfather had his surname changed to Manilow a few weeks before Barry&#x27;s bar mitzvah.

Manilow grew up in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn and graduated in 1961 from the now-defunct Eastern District High School. While in high school, he met Susan Deixler, and they later married for a short time. He enrolled in the City College of New York, where he briefly studied before entering the New York College of Music. He also worked at CBS to pay his expenses while he was a student. Afterward he studied musical theater at Juilliard Performing Arts School.

==Career==

===1960s===
In 1964, Manilow met Bro Herrod, a CBS director, who asked him to arrange some songs for a musical adaptation of the melodrama, &quot;The Drunkard&quot;. Instead, Manilow wrote an entire original score. Herrod used Manilow&#x27;s composition in the Off Broadway musical, which had an eight-year run at New York&#x27;s 13th Street Repertory Theatre.

During this time, Manilow began work as a commercial jingle writer and singer, which continued through the remainder of the 1960s. He performed many of the TV jingles that he composed, including State Farm Insurance (&quot;Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there&quot;) or Band-Aid (&quot;I am stuck on Band-Aid, &#x27;cause Band-Aid&#x27;s stuck on me!&quot;), for which he adopted a childlike voice and wrote the music (Donald B Wood wrote the lyrics). His singing-only credits include commercials for Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pepsi (&quot;all across the nation, it&#x27;s the Pepsi Generation&quot;), McDonald&#x27;s (&quot;you deserve a break today&quot;), and Dr Pepper. Manilow was awarded an Honorary Clio at the 50th Anniversary Clio Awards in Las Vegas in 2009 for his 1960s work as a jingle writer and singer. When accepting the award, he stated that he learned the most about making pop music by working for three or four years as a writer in the jingle industry.

By 1967, Manilow was the musical director for the WCBS-TV series &quot;Callback&quot;, which premiered on January 27, 1968. He next conducted and arranged for Ed Sullivan&#x27;s production company, arranging a new theme for &quot;The Late Show&quot;, while writing, producing, and singing his radio and television jingles. At the same time, he and Jeanne Lucas performed as a duo for a two-season run at Julius Monk&#x27;s Upstairs at the Downstairs club in New York.

By 1969, Manilow was signed by Columbia/CBS Music vice-president and recording artist, Tony Orlando, who went on to co-write with and produce Manilow and a group of studio musicians under the name &quot;Featherbed&quot; on the Columbia Pictures&#x27; newly acquired Bell Records label.&quot;

===1970s===
Manilow recorded and accompanied artists on the piano for auditions and performances in the first two years of the 1970s. He recorded four tracks as Featherbed, produced by Tony Orlando on Bell Records. Three of the tracks were: &quot;Morning&quot;, a ballad; &quot;Amy&quot;, a psychedelic-influenced pop song; and an early, uptempo version of his own co-composition (with Orlando), &quot;Could It Be Magic&quot;. The fourth tune recorded was &quot;Rosalie Rosie&quot;, which was to be the flip side of &quot;Could It Be Magic&quot;, but Bell Records went with &quot;Morning&quot; as the flip for Featherbed&#x27;s second release instead. Neither of two singles released impacted on the charts.

Bette Midler saw Manilow&#x27;s act in 1971 and chose the young musician as her pianist at the Continental Baths in New York City that year, and subsequently as a producer on both her debut and second record albums &quot;The Divine Miss M&quot; (1972) and &quot;Bette Midler&quot; (1973). He also acted as her musical director on the tour mounted for her first album. In 1973, Manilow was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for his production role on &quot;The Divine Miss M&quot; at the 16th Grammy Awards. Manilow worked with Midler from 1971 to 1975.

After the Featherbed singles failed to impact on the music charts, in July 1973, Bell Records released the album &quot;Barry Manilow&quot;, which offered an eclectic mix of piano-driven pop and guitar-driven rock music, including a song called &quot;I Am Your Child&quot;, which Manilow had composed with Marty Panzer.

Among other songs on the album were Jon Hendricks&#x27; vocalese jazz standard &quot;Cloudburst&quot;, most successfully recorded by his group Lambert, Hendricks and Ross in 1959, and a slower-tempo version of &quot;Could It Be Magic&quot;. The latter&#x27;s music was based on Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Prelude in C Minor&quot; and provided Donna Summer with one of her first hits. It was also covered by Take That in the 1990s, as an up-beat disco version of the song. Take That have since performed Manilow&#x27;s original version during their Beautiful World Tour.

In 1974, Clive Davis became temporary president of Bell with the goal of revitalizing Columbia Pictures&#x27;s music division. With a $10 million investment by CPI, and a reorganization of the various Columbia Pictures legacy labels (Colpix, Colgems, and Bell), Davis introduced Columbia Pictures&#x27; new record division, Arista, in November 1974, with Davis himself owning 20% of the new venture. Bell had its final number 1 hit in January 1975 with Manilow&#x27;s breakthrough 1974 release of the single &quot;Mandy&quot; (Bell 45,613), followed shortly by the label&#x27;s final hit, as well as its final single, &quot;Look in My Eyes Pretty Woman&quot; by Tony Orlando and Dawn (Bell 45,620—US No. 11), after which the more successful Bell albums were reissued on Arista. The final releases using the Bell imprint have the designation &quot;Bell Records, Distributed by Arista Records, 1776 Broadway, New York, New York 10019&quot; around the rim of the label.

Davis&#x27; reorganization efforts continued to bear fruit in 1974, with the release of Manilow&#x27;s second album, &quot;Barry Manilow II&quot;, with &quot;Mandy&quot; as the lead single. Manilow had not wanted to record the song, which had originally been titled &quot;Brandy&quot; when originally recorded by its co-writer Scott English, but the song was included at the insistence of Davis. The title was changed to &quot;Mandy&quot; during the actual recording session on August 20, 1974, due to the fact that there had already been a song called &quot;Brandy (You&#x27;re a Fine Girl)&quot; performed by Looking Glass and released in 1972 on Davis&#x27; Epic label.

&quot;Mandy&quot; was the start of a string of hit singles and albums that lasted through the early 1980s, coming from the multi-platinum and multi-hit albums &quot;Tryin&#x27; to Get the Feeling&quot;, &quot;This One&#x27;s for You&quot;, &quot;Even Now&quot;, and &quot;One Voice&quot;. Following the success of &quot;Barry Manilow II&quot;, the first Bell Records album was remixed and reissued on Arista Records as &quot;Barry Manilow I&quot;. When Manilow went on his first tour, he included in his show what he called &quot;A V.S.M.&quot;, or &quot;A Very Strange Medley&quot;, a sampling of some of the commercial jingles that he had written, composed, and/or sung in the 1960s. The medley appeared later on his triple-platinum 1977 album &quot;Barry Manilow Live&quot;.

Beginning with Manilow&#x27;s March 22, 1975, appearance on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; to promote the second album, a productive friendship with Dick Clark started. Among their projects together were numerous appearances by Manilow on Clark&#x27;s productions of &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot;, singing his original seasonal favorite &quot;It&#x27;s Just Another New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot; anniversary shows, &quot;American Music Awards&quot; performances, and the 1985 television movie &quot;Copacabana&quot;, starring Manilow and executive produced by Clark.

Despite being a songwriter in his own right, several of Manilow&#x27;s commercial successes were songs written by others. In addition to &quot;Mandy&quot;, other hits that he did not write or compose include &quot;Tryin&#x27; to Get the Feeling Again&quot; (by David Pomeranz), &quot;Weekend in New England&quot; (by Randy Edelman), &quot;Ships&quot; (by Ian Hunter), &quot;Looks Like We Made It&quot; (by Richard Kerr and Will Jennings), &quot;Can&#x27;t Smile Without You&quot; and &quot;Ready to Take a Chance Again&quot; (by Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel). His number 1 hit &quot;I Write the Songs&quot; was composed by Bruce Johnston of The Beach Boys. According to album liner notes, Manilow did, however, perform co-production as well as arrangement duties on all the above tracks along with Ron Dante, most famous for his vocals on records by The Archies.

Manilow&#x27;s breakthrough in Britain came with the release of &quot;Even Now&quot;, the first of many top-20 albums on that side of the Atlantic, which contained four singles that became major hits in the US. This was quickly followed by &quot;Manilow Magic The Best Of Barry Manilow&quot;, also known as &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, ABC aired four variety television specials starring Manilow, who served as an executive producer. &quot;The Barry Manilow Special&quot; with Penny Marshall as his guest premiered on March 2, 1977, to an audience of 37 million. The special was nominated for four Emmys at the 29th Primetime Emmy Awards and won in the category of Outstanding Special–Comedy, Variety or Music. &quot;The Second Barry Manilow Special&quot; in 1978, with Ray Charles as his guest, was also nominated for four Emmys at the 30th Primetime Emmy Awards.
Manilow&#x27;s &quot;Ready to Take a Chance Again&quot; originated in the film &quot;Foul Play&quot;, which also featured &quot;Copacabana&quot;, from his fourth studio album &quot;Even Now&quot;. &quot;Ready to Take a Chance Again&quot; and its songwriters Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel were nominated that year for the &quot;Best Original Song&quot; Oscar at the 51st Academy Awards. On February 11, 1979, a concert from Manilow&#x27;s sold-out dates from his Even Now Tour at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles aired on the HBO series &quot;Standing Room Only&quot;, which was the first pay-television show to pose a serious threat to network primetime specials for ratings. From the same tour in 1978, a one-hour special from Manilow&#x27;s sold-out concert at the Royal Albert Hall aired in the UK.

On May 23, 1979, ABC aired &quot;The Third Barry Manilow Special&quot;, with John Denver as his guest. This special was nominated for two Emmy awards at the 31st Primetime Emmy Awards and won for Outstanding Choreography. Also in 1979, Manilow produced Dionne Warwick&#x27;s &quot;comeback&quot; album &quot;Dionne&quot;, her first to go platinum. He scored a top ten hit of his own, in the fall of 1979, with the song &quot;Ships&quot; (written and composed by Ian Hunter, former lead singer of Mott the Hoople) from the album &quot;One Voice&quot;.

===1980s===
During the 1980s, Manilow topped the Adult Contemporary radio charts with songs such as &quot;The Old Songs&quot;, &quot;Somewhere Down the Road&quot;, &quot;Read &#x27;Em and Weep&quot; (written by Jim Steinman), and a remake of the 1941 Jule Styne and Frank Loesser standard &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Walk Without You&quot;. Manilow&#x27;s songs continued to receive frequent radio airplay throughout the decade. In the UK, Manilow performed five sold-out concerts at the Royal Albert Hall. In the United States, at Radio City Music Hall, his 1984 ten-night run set a box-office sales record of nearly $2 million, making him the top draw in the 52-year history of the venue. In 1980, Manilow&#x27;s &quot;One Voice&quot; special, with Dionne Warwick as his guest, was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Music Direction at the 32nd Primetime Emmy Awards.

Also in 1980, a concert from Manilow&#x27;s sold-out shows at London England&#x27;s Wembley Arena was broadcast while he was on a world tour. Manilow released the self-titled &quot;Barry&quot; (1980), which was his first album to not reach the top ten in the United States, stopping at number 15. The album contained the top 10 hits &quot;I Made It Through the Rain&quot; (originally a minor hit for its writer, Gerard Kenny) and &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot;. The album &quot;If I Should Love Again&quot; followed in 1981, with two top 40 recordings that both hit number 1 on the AC chart &quot;The Old Songs&quot; and &quot;Somewhere Down The Road&quot; and a third single that became a hit in the UK a cover of the 1965 The Four Seasons smash &quot;Let&#x27;s Hang On!&quot;. This was the first of his albums that Manilow produced without Ron Dante, who had co-produced all the previous albums. Manilow&#x27;s sold-out concert at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in Pittsburgh aired nationally on Showtime and locally on Philadelphia&#x27;s now-defunct PRISM. In 1982, a concert from his sold-out Royal Albert Hall show was broadcast in England. The live album and video &quot;Barry Live in Britain&quot; also came from his Royal Albert Hall shows.

On August 27, 1983, Manilow performed a landmark open-air concert at Blenheim Palace in Britain, an event that he told the audience was &quot;one of the most exciting nights&quot; in his life. It was the first such event ever held at that venue and was attended by an estimated 40,000 people. This concert was also taped for airing on Showtime. In December 1983, Manilow was reported to have endowed the music departments at six major universities in the United States and Canada. The endowments were part of a continuing endeavor by Manilow to recognize and encourage new musical talent.

In 1984, Manilow released &quot;2:00 AM Paradise Cafe&quot;, a jazz/blues collection of original barroom tunes recorded in one live take in the studio. That same year, Showtime aired a documentary of Manilow recording the album with a number of jazz legends including Sarah Vaughan and Mel Tormé. In 1984 and 1985, England aired two one-hour concert specials from his National Exhibition Centre (NEC) concerts. In 1985, Manilow left Arista Records for RCA Records, where he released the pop album &quot;Manilow&quot;, and began a phase of international music, as he performed songs and duets in French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese. The &quot;Manilow&quot; album was a complete about-face from the &quot;Paradise Cafe&quot; album, containing a number of uptempo tracks that featured synthesizers. In 1985, Japan aired a Manilow concert special where he played &quot;Sakura&quot; on the koto.

In his only lead acting role, he portrayed Tony Starr in the 1985 CBS film &quot;Copacabana&quot;, which was based on his 1978 hit song &quot;Copacabana&quot;, alongside Annette O&#x27;Toole as Lola Lamarr and Joseph Bologna as Rico Castelli. Manilow penned all the songs for the movie, with lyrics provided by his longtime collaborators Bruce Sussman and Jack Feldman. A soundtrack album for the TV film, &quot;&quot;, was released on RCA Records.

In October 1986, Manilow, along with Bruce Sussman, Tom Scott, and Charlie Fox, went to Washington, D.C. for two days of meetings with legislators, including lunch with then Senator Al Gore (D-TN). They were there to lobby against a copyright bill put forward by local television broadcasters that would mandate songwriter-producer source licensing of theme and incidental music on syndicated television show reruns and would disallow the use of the blanket license then in effect. The songwriters said without the blanket license, artists would have to negotiate up front with producers individually, without knowing if a series would be a success. The license now pays according to a per-use formula. Manilow said that such a bill would act as a precedent for broadcasters to get rid of the blanket license entirely.

The following year, McGraw-Hill published Manilow&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Sweet Life: Adventures on the Way to Paradise&quot;, which took three years to complete. While promoting the work, Manilow defended his music in a telephone interview: &quot;I live in laid-back L.A., but in my heart, I&#x27;m an energetic New Yorker and that&#x27;s what has always come out of my music. I&#x27;ve always been surprised when the critics said I made wimpy little ballads.&quot; Manilow returned to Arista Records in 1987 with the release of &quot;Swing Street&quot;. The album, a mixture of traditional after-dark and techno jazz, contained &quot;Brooklyn Blues&quot;, an autobiographical song for Manilow, and &quot;Hey Mambo&quot;, an uptempo Latin style duet with Kid Creole, produced with the help of Emilio Estefan, Jr., founder of Miami Sound Machine.

CBS aired Manilow&#x27;s &quot;Big Fun on Swing Street&quot; special in March 1988. It featured songs and special guests from his &quot;Swing Street&quot; and &quot;2:00 am Paradise Cafe&quot; albums, including Kid Creole and the Coconuts, Phyllis Hyman, Stanley Clarke, Carmen McRae, Tom Scott, and Uncle Festive, a band within Manilow&#x27;s band at the time. The special was nominated for two Emmys in technical categories, and won in the category of Outstanding Art Direction for a Variety or Music Program at the 40th Primetime Emmy Awards.

In 1988, Manilow performed &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Be Scared&quot; and &quot;Mandy/Could It Be Magic&quot; at &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For: AIDS Concert &#x27;88&quot;, a benefit concert for the Warwick Foundation headed by Dionne Warwick and shown on Showtime a few years later. In the 1988 Walt Disney Pictures animated feature &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;, Bette Midler&#x27;s character sang a new Manilow composition called &quot;Perfect Isn&#x27;t Easy&quot;. The 1989 release of &quot;Barry Manilow&quot;, which contained &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Be Scared&quot;, &quot;Keep Each Other Warm&quot;, and &quot;The One That Got Away&quot;, ended Manilow&#x27;s streak of albums of original self-written material (he only wrote or arranged two of the album&#x27;s songs) and began a phase of his recording career consisting of covers and compilations.

From April 18 to June 10, 1989, Manilow put on a show called &quot;Barry Manilow at the Gershwin&quot;, making 44 appearances at the Gershwin Theatre (also known as the Uris Theatre), where he had also recorded &quot;Barry Manilow Live&quot; in 1976. A bestselling 90-minute video of the same show was released the following year as &quot;Barry Manilow Live on Broadway&quot;. The Showtime one-hour special &quot;Barry Manilow SRO on Broadway&quot; consisted of edited highlights from this video. Manilow followed this set of shows with a world tour of the Broadway show.

===1990s===
Manilow released a number of cover tunes during the 1990s, starting with tracks on the 1989 release &quot;Barry Manilow&quot;, and continuing with his 1990 Christmas LP &quot;Because It&#x27;s Christmas&quot;. On the Christmas album, Manilow was joined by pop girl trio Exposé and together they recreated, note for note, a 1943 million-selling recording of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; by Bing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters. Manilow has credited Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne Andrews as inspiring him, perhaps most evident in his recording of &quot;Jump, Shout Boogie&quot;. Consequent &quot;event&quot; albums followed, including: &quot;Showstoppers&quot;, a collection of Broadway songs (1991), &quot;Singin&#x27; with the Big Bands&quot; (1994) and a late 1970s collection &quot;Summer of &#x27;78&quot; (1996), which included the hit &quot;I Go Crazy&quot;, formerly a hit for Paul Davis in 1978. The decade ended with Manilow recording a tribute to Frank Sinatra &quot;Manilow Sings Sinatra&quot; (1998) released months after Sinatra&#x27;s death.

In 1990, Japan aired &quot;National Eolia Special: Barry Manilow On Broadway&quot; where he sang the title song &quot;Eolia&quot;, which was used as a song there in a commercial for an air conditioner company of the same name, as well as other songs from his 1989–1990 &quot;Live on Broadway&quot; tour. In the early 1990s, Manilow signed on with Don Bluth to compose the songs with lyricists Jack Feldman and Bruce Sussman for three animated films. He co-wrote the Broadway-style musical scores for &quot;Thumbelina&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Pebble and the Penguin&quot; (1995). The third film, entitled &quot;Rapunzel&quot;, was shelved after the poor performance of &quot;The Pebble and the Penguin&quot;. Manilow was also to be cast as the voice of a cricket. Manilow also composed the score and wrote two songs with Bruce Sussman for &quot;Disney Sing Along Songs: Let&#x27;s Go To The Circus&quot;.

Manilow produced the 1991 album &quot;With My Lover Beside Me&quot; by legendary jazz vocalist Nancy Wilson. The record is based on lyrics left behind by famed composer Johnny Mercer that had never been set to music. Manilow was invited in 1993 by Mercer&#x27;s widow to complete the songs. His own recording of &quot;When October Goes&quot;, with lyrics by Mercer, was released as a single in 1984, from his album &quot;2:00 AM Paradise Cafe&quot;. Further Mercer compositions were set to music by Manilow over the following years, culminating in the 1991 Nancy Wilson release. Manilow is featured in a duet on the record in the final cut &quot;Epilogue&quot;.

On February 19, 1992, Manilow testified before the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration House Committee in support of H.R. 3204, The Audio Home Recording Act of 1991. The bill was signed into law on October 28, 1992, by President George H. W. Bush and became effective immediately. In 1993, PBS aired &quot;Barry Manilow: The Best of Me&quot;, which was taped at Wembley Arena in England earlier that year. The BBC also played a one-hour version of the same show including &quot;The Best of Me&quot;, sung during the concert, as a bonus song or &quot;lucky strike extra&quot; as Manilow says, not seen in &quot;The Complete Collection and Then Some...&quot;, the video release of the show; however, the song was included on the DVD of the same title, with Manilow seated in front of a black curtain, lip-syncing to the recording. He performed 14 concerts as part of an extended tour covering Germany, Austria and Denmark. Manilow branched out in another direction and, with long-time lyricist Bruce Sussman, launched &quot;Copacabana&quot;, a musical play based on previous Manilow-related adaptations. They wrote new songs and it ran for two years in London&#x27;s West End, and a tour company formed.

In December 1996, A&amp;E aired &quot;Barry Manilow: Live By Request&quot;, the first of his two &quot;Live By Request&quot; appearances. The broadcast was A&amp;E&#x27;s most successful music program, attracting an estimated 2.4 million viewers. The show was also simulcast on the radio. In March 1997, VH-1 aired &quot;Barry Manilow: The Summer of &#x27;78&quot;, a one-hour special of Manilow solo at the piano being interviewed and playing his greatest hits as well as songs from &quot;Summer of &#x27;78&quot;, his latest release at the time.

In another collaboration, Manilow and Sussman co-wrote &quot;Harmony: A New Musical&quot;, based on the story of the Comedian Harmonists, a male singing group popular in Germany from 1928 to 1934. The musical previewed from October 7 to November 23, 1997, at the La Jolla Playhouse. In 2003, &quot;Harmony&quot; was originally scheduled for a tryout run in Philadelphia before going to Broadway, but was canceled after financial difficulties. In a legal battle with Mark Schwartz, the show&#x27;s producer, Manilow and Sussman in 2005 won back the rights to the musical. The work was staged in Atlanta in 2013 and Los Angeles in 2014, had its New York debut in 2022 at the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene and came to Broadway in late 2023 for a three-month run at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre.

In 1998, Manilow released the record album &quot;Manilow Sings Sinatra&quot; which earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 1999.

On October 23, 1999, NBC aired the two-hour special &quot;StarSkates Salute to Barry Manilow&quot;, taped at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas, featuring numerous figure skaters performing to Manilow&#x27;s music. Manilow also performed.

===2000s===
In 2000, Manilow had two specials, &quot;Manilow Country&quot; and &quot;Manilow Live!&quot;, taped over two consecutive days at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center in Nashville, Tennessee. On April 11, 2000, The Nashville Network (TNN) aired the two-hour &quot;Manilow Country&quot;, which featured country stars Trisha Yearwood, Neal McCoy, Deana Carter, Jo Dee Messina, Lorrie Morgan, Kevin Sharp, Lila McCann, Gillian Welch and Jaci Velasquez singing their favorite Manilow hits with a &quot;country&quot; twist; Manilow also performed. This special was TNN&#x27;s first High Definition (HD) broadcast and became one of TNN&#x27;s highest rated concert specials.

In June 2000, DirectTV aired the two-hour concert special &quot;Manilow Live!&quot; where Manilow had his band, a 30-piece orchestra, and a choir. This HDTV special documented the concert tour at the time with the greatest hits of his career and was also released to video. Also that year, he worked with Monica Mancini on her Concord album &quot;The Dreams of Johnny Mercer&quot;, which included seven songs of Mercer&#x27;s lyrics set to Manilow&#x27;s music. Meanwhile, Manilow&#x27;s record contract with Arista Records was not renewed due to new management. He then got a contract at Concord Records, a jazz-oriented label in California, and started work on the long-anticipated concept album &quot;Here at the Mayflower&quot;. The album was another eclectic mix of styles, almost entirely composed and produced by Manilow himself.

While Manilow was at Concord Records, the Barry Manilow Scholarship was awarded for four consecutive years (2002–2005) to the six highest-achieving students to reward excellence in the art and craft of lyric writing. The UCLA Extension course &quot;Writing Lyrics That Succeed and Endure&quot; was taught by long-time Manilow collaborator Marty Panzer, and each student received three additional &quot;master class&quot; advanced sessions as well as a three-hour private, one-on-one session with Panzer. Scholarship recipients were selected by the instructor based on progress made within the course, lyric writing ability, and the instructor&#x27;s assessment of real potential in the field of songwriting. In February 2002, Manilow returned to the charts when Arista released a greatest hits album, &quot;Ultimate Manilow&quot;. On May 18, 2002, Manilow returned to CBS with &quot;Ultimate Manilow&quot;, his first special on the network since his &quot;Big Fun on Swing Street&quot; special in 1988. The special was filmed in the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, California, and was nominated for an Emmy in the category of Outstanding Music Direction at the 54th Primetime Emmy Awards.

Produced by Manilow, &quot;Bette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook&quot; was released on September 30, 2003. It was the first time that the pair had worked together in more than twenty years. The album went gold, and they collaborated again in 2005 on &quot;Bette Midler Sings the Peggy Lee Songbook&quot;. On December 3, 2003, A&amp;E aired &quot;A Barry Manilow Christmas: Live by Request&quot;, his second of two concerts for the series. The two-hour special had Manilow taking requests for Christmas songs performed live with a band and an orchestra. Manilow told the audience that he was what Clay Aiken was going to look like in thirty years, thus acknowledging an ongoing comparison between the two. Also on the special were guests Cyndi Lauper, José Feliciano, and Bette Midler (Midler, busy preparing her own tour in Los Angeles, appeared only in a pre-taped segment).

In 2004, Manilow released two albums: a live album, &quot;2 Nights Live!&quot; (BMG Strategic Marketing Group, 2004); and &quot;Scores: Songs from Copacabana &amp; Harmony&quot;, an album of Manilow singing songs from his musicals. &quot;Scores&quot; was the last of Manilow&#x27;s creative projects with the Concord label.
During his third appearance on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; on September 15, 2004, Winfrey announced that Manilow is one of the most requested guests of all time on her show. On the show, he promoted his &quot;One Night Live! One Last Time!&quot; tour. It was around this time period where Manilow appeared for the first time on the mainstream FOX program &quot;American Idol&quot; in which his back-up singer, Debra Byrd, doubles as voice coach on the series. Manilow also appeared on Clay Aiken&#x27;s TV special, &quot;A Clay Aiken Christmas&quot;.

Las Vegas Hilton executives in a press conference with Manilow on December 14, 2004, announced his signing to a long-term engagement as the house show. He began the residency in February 2005 with a show entitled &quot;Manilow: Music and Passion&quot;. In March 2006, Manilow&#x27;s engagement was extended through 2008.

Manilow returned to Arista Records under Davis for a new covers album, released January 31, 2006, called &quot;The Greatest Songs of the Fifties&quot;. Manilow said he was blown away with the idea, which Davis presented when he visited Manilow&#x27;s Las Vegas show. &quot;When he suggested this idea to me, I slapped my forehead and said, &#x27;Why hasn&#x27;t anyone thought of this idea?&#x27;&quot; Manilow said. It was an unexpected success, debuting at number one in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, marking the first time a Manilow album debuted at the top of the album chart as well as the first time a Manilow album has reached number one in 29 years. It was eventually certified Platinum in the U.S., and sold more than 3 million copies worldwide.

In March 2006, PBS aired &quot;Barry Manilow: Music and Passion&quot;, a Hilton concert recorded exclusively for the network&#x27;s fundraising drive. Manilow was nominated for two Emmys, winning for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program at the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards. A sequel album to his bestselling fifties tribute album, &quot;The Greatest Songs of the Sixties&quot; was released on October 31, 2006, including songs such as &quot;And I Love Her&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot;. It nearly repeated the success of its predecessor, debuting at number 2 in the Billboard 200.
In January 2007, Manilow returned to his hometown of New York City for three shows at Madison Square Garden. These included showing onscreen Manilow performing in one of his first television appearances, while the &quot;live&quot; Manilow played along onstage. The same year saw him playing several shows on the east coast of the United States in August. Four more took place in December, half in the New York tri-state area in Uniondale and East Rutherford, and two in Cleveland and Detroit. Manilow launched another short tour in early 2008, visiting several large venues including the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota. A further album in the decades themed series, &quot;The Greatest Songs of the Seventies&quot;, went on release September 18, 2007. &quot;Barry Manilow: Songs from the Seventies&quot;, a PBS concert special based on the work, was taped in Manilow&#x27;s home town, Brooklyn, in October 2007. The show aired on PBS in December 2007 and was rebroadcast over New Year 2009. He appeared on &quot;American Idol&quot; on February 3, 2009, during Hollywood Week to give advice to the contestants.

Manilow released his third Christmas album in November 2007, &quot;In the Swing of Christmas&quot;, which went Gold and earned him another Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album Grammy Award nomination at the 51st Grammy Awards in 2008.

In December 2008, Manilow narrated the animated Christmas special &quot;Cranberry Christmas&quot;, which was broadcast on ABC Family and sponsored by Ocean Spray. In addition to narrating, he also contributed two original songs that he composed with his long time collaborator, lyricist Bruce Sussman: &quot;Christmas Is Just Around the Corner&quot; and &quot;Watch Out for Mr. Grape&quot;. &quot;Christmas Is Just Around the Corner&quot; was also released as a single, and appeared as a bonus track on the 2009 re-release of &quot;In the Swing of Christmas&quot;.

In October 2009, Manilow TV, a monthly video subscription service, launched. Once a month, Barry Manilow picks a different concert from his personal archive to show to subscribers. In the first month, the first episode showed performances on April 20–21, 1996, at Wembley Arena in London.

Manilow ended his residency at the Hilton with a show entitled &quot;Ultimate Manilow: the Hits&quot; on December 30, 2009, after 300 performances for 450,000 fans.

===2010s===

On January 26, 2010, Manilow released &quot;The Greatest Love Songs of All Time&quot;, and, in December of that year, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards.

He opened his new show &quot;Manilow Paris Las Vegas&quot; at the Paris Hotel &amp; Casino at Las Vegas in March 2010.

On December 11, 2010, Manilow performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway.

Manilow completed work on his new album, &quot;15 Minutes&quot;, in March 2011, with his official Facebook page announcing that he had completed putting &quot;finishing touches&quot; to the album on March 16, 2011.

On March 13, 2011, Manilow appeared at the 2011 Laurence Olivier Awards at London&#x27;s Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, singing &quot;Copacabana&quot; with the BBC Concert Orchestra and also singing with hit West End star, Kerry Ellis.

Since March 2011, he has hosted &quot;They Write the Songs&quot;, a documentary series for BBC Radio 2 in which he looks at the life and work of popular composers.

In May 2011, Manilow recorded his concerts at the O2 Arena in London, for CD and DVD release in early 2012.

In a June 2011 interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Manilow said that his new album is influenced by Britney Spears; the album is about the pleasures and pitfalls of fame. It was influenced directly by Spears&#x27; personal struggles in late 2007. The album &quot;15 Minutes&quot; debuted at number 7 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album Chart. The first single from &quot;15 Minutes&quot;, &quot;Bring on Tomorrow&quot;, entered the U.S. Billboard Hot 200 Singles Chart&#x27;s top 40, becoming Manilow&#x27;s 47th top 40 hit.

In November 2011, Manilow recorded his shows at the Paris Las Vegas for an upcoming TV special and DVD release.

Manilow concluded his two-year residency at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas on December 11, 2012. This also ended his seven-year stay in Las Vegas.

In January 2013, Manilow returned to Broadway with his concert series &quot;Manilow on Broadway&quot;. It was his first appearance on Broadway in more than two decades.

On July 4, 2013, Manilow performed live on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol as part of &quot;A Capitol Fourth&quot;. This was his second appearance on the PBS program.

On September 6, 2013, &quot;Harmony: A New Musical&quot; started a second run. This time at Atlanta&#x27;s Alliance Theatre. The musical then had performances in Los Angeles in 2014.

On November 12, 2013, he performed at the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Children in Need Rocks 2013&quot;.

On March 11, 2014, Manilow released &quot;Night Songs&quot;, an album of standards performed only with piano and synthesized acoustic bass by Manilow himself. It earned him a Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album Grammy nomination that year at the 57th Grammy Awards.

On October 28, 2014, Manilow released &quot;My Dream Duets&quot;, which won him his fourth Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album Grammy Award nomination at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards. This was the fifteenth Grammy Award nomination of his career with nominations occurring in every decade since the 1970s.

On February 11, 2015, Manilow began his One Last Time! tour at the CenturyLink Center Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska with stops at most major North American venues. Other destinations included Chicago at the United Center, Los Angeles at the Staples Center, and Brooklyn at the Barclay&#x27;s Center for the tour finale on June 17, where Manilow celebrated his 72nd birthday during his Barclays Center debut.

In 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; declared that Manilow has been on a &quot;Billboard 200&quot; hot streak since 2002, when his greatest-hits collection &quot;Ultimate Manilow&quot; debuted and peaked at No. 3 (February 23, 2002), becoming his highest-charting set (and first top 10) since 1979&#x27;s &quot;One Voice&quot; (No. 9). Since 2002, Manilow has logged a dozen top 40 efforts (including Ultimate). Further, he has notched at least one top 40 album in each of the five decades from the 1970s through the 2010s.

In 2019, it was announced that Manilow&#x27;s original musical &quot;Harmony&quot; would make its New York debut at National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene in the Museum of Jewish Heritage, running from February 11 until March 29, 2020. The run was canceled due to the start of the COVID-19 health crisis and rescheduled for Spring of 2022.

===2020s===
On February 14, 2020, Manilow released &quot;Night Songs II&quot;, which debuted at No. 32 on the Billboard 200, marking his sixth consecutive decade of top 40-charting albums beginning with &quot;Barry Manilow II&quot; in 1975.

In April 2020, Manilow scored his 36th top-20 Billboard Adult Contemporary chart hit with &quot;When the Good Times Come Again&quot; which peaked at number 12 on the week of July 2. The song was originally recorded for his self-titled 1989 album and never released as a single. A fan made a lyric video for the song when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Manilow found the video and posted it on his Facebook page, leading his management company to send the song to radio stations for airplay.

In August 2020, Manilow sold his song catalog to Hipgnosis Songs Fund.

In 2021, Manilow started his The Hits Come Home residency at the Westgate Hotel in Las Vegas.

On December 11, 2023, NBC aired a Christmas special &quot;Barry Manilow&#x27;s A Very Barry Christmas&quot;, featuring Manilow.

A fourteen-night residency at the London Palladium in May and June 2024 has been billed as the &quot;last, last UK concerts&quot;.

==Personal life==
Manilow married his high-school sweetheart, Susan Deixler, in 1964. Manilow later stated that he was in love with his wife and that his passion for a music career, in addition to his lack of maturity, put a strain on their relationship. He left the woman he considered &quot;the perfect wife&quot; after just one year of marriage in pursuit of a &quot;wondrous musical adventure&quot;. Manilow credits the response he received from &quot;Playboy&quot; in December 1965 for the courage to leave everything behind and begin a career in music: Deixler had the marriage annulled in 1966. After coming out as gay in 2017, Manilow stated that he had been in love with Deixler and the failure of his marriage at the time was not related to issues of sexual orientation.

Manilow began a relationship with TV executive Garry Kief, who soon became his manager, in 1978. The two married in 2014, after same-sex marriage became legal in California. They kept the relationship and his sexual orientation private until the marriage made headlines in 2015. Manilow did not initially want his personal relationship with Kief to become public. The media began to publicize the event when a friend of Manilow&#x27;s, Suzanne Somers, publicly disclosed the private exchange of vows at Manilow&#x27;s home in Palm Springs, California. No official paperwork was filed, but it was reported that Manilow and Kief exchanged wedding bands as a sign of their dedication. Manilow officially came out as gay in April 2017, telling &quot;People&quot; that he was pleasantly surprised to find that his mostly female fan base was supportive of the marriage; he had feared the news would disappoint them.

Manilow has a stepdaughter through his husband&#x27;s previous marriage and an adopted granddaughter.

== Philanthropy and fundraising ==
To help with the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo in 1989, which affected the Charleston, South Carolina, area, Manilow held a benefit concert November 12, 1989, at the University of South Carolina&#x27;s Carolina Coliseum in Columbia where the $10 tickets sold out in three hours, and asked concertgoers to bring canned food to be donated to residents in disaster areas. Before his concert, Mayor T. Patton Adams named that day Barry Manilow Day, and Manilow presented The Red Cross and The Salvation Army with checks of $42,500 each.

On January 15, 1994, three hours before showtime, Manilow canceled a performance at an Ethnic Pride and Heritage Festival hosted at the Convention Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Benefactors included the Children&#x27;s Hospital of New Jersey in Newark, the Community Foundation of New Jersey as well as United Hospitals Medical Center Foundation and Newark Museum in Newark during the pre-inaugural activities for then New Jersey Governor-elect Christie Whitman. Manilow said that he was specifically told in writing that the concert would be part of a non-partisan event.

To help in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, for every U.S. dollar donated by his fans to the American Red Cross through the Manilow Fund for Health and Hope website, Manilow personally matched, and the fund itself also matched, tripling the original donation. The fund delivered $150,000, raised in 48 hours, to the American Red Cross.

On October 27, 2011, Manilow visited Joplin, Missouri, a little more than five months after a tornado destroyed one-third of that city, including its only high school. His Manilow Music Project made a contribution of $300,000 to restore the musical program and instruments that were lost.

== Litigation ==
On February 8, 1994, Manilow sued Los Angeles radio station KBIG (104.3 FM), seeking $13 million in damages and $15 million in punitive damages, claiming that one of their advertisements was causing irreparable damage to his professional reputation. The ad, a thirty-second spot which began airing on January 31, suggested that people listen to KBIG because it does &quot;not&quot; play Manilow&#x27;s music. The lawsuit was filed in Orange County Superior Court by Los Angeles attorney C. Tucker Cheadle. Two days later, KBIG/104.3 FM agreed to drop the commercial poking fun at the singer, but a lawyer representing his business interests stopped short of agreeing to withdraw a $28 million lawsuit.

Arizona Court of Appeals Judge Philip Espinosa sued Manilow over the audio volume of a December 23, 1993, concert he attended with his wife. The judge said in the lawsuit he has had a constant ringing in his ears (tinnitus) and nearly blew his ears out. Espinosa sought unspecified damages, and the trial was set for September 23, 1997. The suit also named Manilow&#x27;s production company, an Arizona concert promoter, and the city of Tucson, Arizona, which runs the convention center where the concert was held. In July 1997, to settle the suit it was reported that Manilow donated $5,000 to the American Tinnitus Association.

==In media==
In 1979, Manilow&#x27;s musical style was satirized in the song &quot;I Need Your Help Barry Manilow&quot; performed by Ray Stevens. The song leads off with a musical phrase resembling the opening of &quot;I Write the Songs&quot; and also references &quot;Mandy&quot;, &quot;Copacabana&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Smile Without You&quot;, &quot;Weekend in New England&quot;, &quot;Could It Be Magic&quot; and &quot;Tryin&#x27; to Get the Feeling Again&quot; in a storyline where the singer details a litany of comedically unfortunate events in his life, reaching the conclusion that he needs Manilow to sing one of his more melancholy and wistful songs to comfort him, as several of Manilow&#x27;s biggest hits have story lines about suffering and misfortune.

The song reached number 49 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number 11 on the Adult Contemporary chart. It spent a total of eight weeks on Hot 100 chart and also charted in Great Britain, Canada, and Australia. The single&#x27;s cover art is a spoof of Manilow&#x27;s album &quot;Barry Manilow II,&quot; and the song&#x27;s album spoofs title and cover art of Manilow&#x27;s &quot;Tryin&#x27; to Get the Feeling&quot;.

In 1989, an American tabloid claimed that Manilow was engaged to porn star Robin Byrd. On a June 22, 1989, appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Johnny Carson asked Manilow about the headline story. Manilow replied that he was just friends with Byrd, an innocent picture had been taken, and that there was no truth to the supposed engagement. After he met Byrd, his band gave him a videotape of &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot; as a present for his birthday. Manilow told Carson that he could not watch his friend doing what she does in that movie.

Manilow made headlines in June 2006 when Australian officials blasted his music from 9:00 p.m. until midnight every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to deter gangs of youths from congregating in a residential area late at night. In February 2022, New Zealand authorities employed a similar tactic against protesters who camped outside the country&#x27;s parliament building to protest against COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

<text>Abdulah Sidran (2 October 1944 – 23 March 2024), often referred to by his hypocoristic nickname &quot;Avdo&quot;, was a Bosnian poet and screenwriter. He is considered to be one of the most influential writers in both Bosnia and Herzegovina and the former Yugoslavia.

Sidran is best known for writing the 1993 poetry book &quot;Sarajevski tabut&quot; (&quot;The Coffin of Sarajevo&quot;), as well as the scripts for Emir Kusturica&#x27;s films &quot;Do You Remember Dolly Bell?&quot; (1981) and the Academy Award nominated &quot;When Father Was Away on Business&quot; (1985). He was a member of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Early life and family==
Abdulah Sidran, the second of four children, was born in Sarajevo during World War II, on 2 October 1944, although several sources inaccurately give his date of birth as 29 September 1944. He was born to Bosniak parents; father Mehmed Sidran (1915–1965) was born in Kiseljak and worked as a locksmith at a railway workshop, while his mother Behija (née Jukić) was a housewife. Sidran had three siblings Ekrem (born 1942; deceased), Nedim (born 4 February 1947) and Edina (born 1953). He was named after his paternal uncle, a typographer and compositor, who perished in 1943 at the Jasenovac concentration camp. The Sidran family roots trace back to the hamlet Biograd near Nevesinje, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Abdulah&#x27;s paternal grandfather Hasan Sidran relocated to Sarajevo from Belgrade in 1903.

==Personal life==
After spending most of his life in Sarajevo, Sidran lived in Goražde before moving to a small village near Tešanj.

In 2019, Sidran, together with some thirty world intellectuals met with French president Emmanuel Macron. A meeting of world intellectuals with Macron was initiated by the prominent French philosopher, writer and journalist Bernard-Henri Lévy.

Sidran died in Sarajevo on 23 March 2024, at the age of 79 following a period of poor health. Shortly after, many prominent Bosnian politicians and public figures reacted to his death and offered their condolences. He was buried in the courtyard of the Ferhadija Mosque in Sarajevo on 27 March.

==Works==
Major works of Sidran include &quot;Šahbaza&quot;, &quot;Bone and Meat&quot;, &quot;The Sarajevo Tomb&quot; (&quot;Sarajevski tabut&quot;), &quot;Why is Venice Sinking&quot; (&quot;Zašto tone Venecija&quot;), several books of poetry, and screenplays for films from the former Yugoslavia, such as &quot;Do You Remember Dolly Bell?&quot; (1981) and &quot;When Father Was Away on Business&quot; (1985), directed by Emir Kusturica, and &quot;Kuduz&quot; (1989), directed by Ademir Kenović. &quot;When Father Was Away on Business&quot; was awarded a Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 58th Academy Awards.

<doc id="526543" wikidata="Q3495261" url="?curid=526543" title="St. Jacobs, Ontario">
<text>St. Jacobs is an unincorporated suburban community in the township of Woolwich in Waterloo Regional Municipality, Ontario, Canada. It is located north of the city of Waterloo. It is a popular location for tourism, due to its quaint appearance, retail focus, and Mennonite heritage. Waterloo Region is still home to the largest population of Old Order Mennonites in Canada, particularly in the areas around St Jacobs and Elmira. They are often seen on the local roads using their traditional horse and buggy transportation; many also use horses to pull the implements in their farm fields.

The Conestogo River, which powered the village&#x27;s original mills by the 1850s, runs through the village. At the time of the 2016 Census, St. Jacobs had a growing population of 1,988 people.

==History==
The two settlements near St. Jacobs were Conestoga and Winterbourne. The latter was settled primarily by English and Scots while St. Jacobs, like Conestoga, was primarily Germanic. This area on the Conestogo River was settled starting in 1830. Early arrivals included the Simon Cress family, Abraham Erb, and John B. Baumann (or Bauman). A significant influx did not happen until the early 1850s. Most of the settlers were Mennonites from Pennsylvania, so-called Pennsylvania Dutch. The word &quot;Dutch&quot; does not refer to the Netherlands but is a misnomer for Deitsch or Deutsch (German). They became known as &quot;Old Order&quot; Mennonites due to their conservative lifestyle. (Other Mennonites in the area have a less conservative lifestyle.) School lessons, even in 1860 were taught entirely in the local dialect of German.

Valentine Ratz built the first sawmill to the west of the village in 1844 and the first school, in a log house, was founded in the same year. Jacob C. Snider, of Swiss German descent, built a sawmill, a flour-mill and a woollen-mill by 1852, after having built a dam. These features helped to attract others to the small community. When the settlement became a village, it was named Jakobstettel (Jacob&#x27;s Village) in honour of Snider. The &quot;St.&quot; was added to the name Jacob simply to make it sound more pleasing; the pluralization was in honour of the combined efforts of Jacob C. Snider (1791–1865) and his son, Jacob C. Snider, Jr. (1822–1857). The younger Jacob lost his life in the Desjardins Canal train disaster at age 35.

An 1851 report indicated that the village itself had a flour mill owned by Benjamin D. Snyder, a hotel, a blacksmith, a general store and a cooperage. 
The first post office opened in 1852, called St. Jacobs, with Joseph Eby as postmaster and the village was incorporated in that year. By 1855, the population was 400 and by then, there were four hotels, including Benjamins which still stands; it was later known as the Dominion Hotel. In 1871, E.W.B. Snider bought the flour mill and promoted hydro electricity and other milling operations. The river helped power mills and a woolen factory and a tannery; by then, the school had 66 students. There was only a single church, (Evangelical Association) built in 1850.

Industry in 1867 included a flour mill, a tannery, a harness shop, a wagon maker, a woollen mill, a barrelmaker. There was also a distillery, several general stores and two hotels as well as artisans and tradesmen. John Ortwein produced the burned limestone that was used in the construction of various buildings. In 1869, the population was 500.

A rail line was not built here until 1891. Even that did not help to boost the population and St. Jacobs remained a small village, with virtually no growth until the 1950s.
In the early 1900s, North Waterloo County - the Kitchener, Waterloo, St. Jacobs, Elmira area - exhibited a strong German culture and those of German origin (from Pennsylvania or direct from Europe) made up a third of the population in 1911. Lutherans were the primary religious group. There were nearly three times as many Lutherans as Mennonites by that time. The latter primarily resided in the rural areas and small communities.

The Home Hardware company, founded in 1963 and still operating, can trace its roots all the way back to the 1880s in St. Jacobs, when a tinsmith shop was opened and was later sold to Henry Gilles, who added a blacksmith shop and hardware store that was managed by his son, Alfred Gilles. In 1933, Henry Sittler took over as manager of the hardware business and stayed on after the business was sold to Gordon Hollinger who added a wholesale division to the hardware store. In 1938, Walter J. Hachborn (who would establish Home Hardware) began working for Hollinger while he was still a teenager; he was able to speak both English and the Low German of his Mennonite customers. Hachborn served in WWII where he worked as a warehouse foreman, learning new skills. After the War, he guided Sittler in buying military surplus goods.

In 1949, Hachborn and Sittler, with a silent partner, bought Hollinger Hardware. The business grew rapidly and new premises were bought, also in St. Jacobs. During a 1962 meeting, the two agreed that independent hardware store owners would benefit from an organization that would allow for lower wholesale prices due to buying in bulk. They met with 25 store owners and by March 1963, 122 dealers committed to the concept, paying to acquire the new corporation, Hollinger Hardware Limited. The company started business in September 1963, with Hachborn as general manager. Eventually, this would lead to the Canada-wide dealer-owned cooperative business with the Home Hardware head office and the massive distribution centre in St. Jacobs. In 2017, there were 1,100 such stores.

==Economy==
===The Village of St. Jacobs===
The Village of St. Jacobs is a commercial centre with over 100 retailers, attractions, and restaurants.

St. Jacobs features artisans in historic buildings, such as the Country Mill, Village Silos, Mill Shed, and Old Factory.

Visitors may watch artisans make pottery, quilts, designer clothes, jewellery, glass vases, woven wall hangings tiffany lamps, stained glass doors, and miniature doll houses. There are also two blacksmith shops. The millrace is a treed hiking path along the Conestogo River.

The Visitor Centre in downtown St. Jacobs is a Mennonite interpretation centre, providing information and education about the Mennonite people in the township.

St. Jacobs is the headquarters of Home Hardware. The first store opened in downtown St. Jacobs in 1964 and remains in use as the local furniture outlet but a large new Home Hardware store across the street opened in November 2014.

St. Jacobs is home to the Southern Ontario Locomotive Restoration Society&#x27;s (SOLRS) Restoration Shop. SOLRS operates the seasonal, recreational Waterloo Central Railway between the St. Jacobs Farmers&#x27; Market, the Village of St. Jacobs, and the town of Elmira. It operates on market days (May to October) and during certain special events including the Maple Syrup Festival in early April.

Three kilometres south of the town centre is the St. Jacobs Farmers&#x27; Market, the most popular tourist draw.

===St. Jacobs Farmers&#x27; Market===
St. Jacobs Farmers&#x27; Market is a farmers&#x27; market and flea market. It is the largest year-round farmer&#x27;s market in Canada, and is a popular destination for residents and tourists. It attracts about one million visitors annually.

The market was established in April 1975 by eight farmers, including Jim Wideman, Jacob Shantz, Ross Shantz, and Milo Shantz; the Shantz families then managed the facility for over forty years. In November 2017, the business was sold to Schlegel Urban Developments which planned to continue business as usual. The sale also included Market Road Antiques, the St. Jacobs Outlets and the property housing the TSC store.

==Attractions==
===Trails and recreation===

The Millrace Footpath, a recreational trail that forms part of the Trans Canada Trail, runs along the Conestogo River from the Village of St. Jacobs to a dam further up the river. The trail offers many scenic views of the river and of the millrace constructed in the 1860s that used to power the village&#x27;s gristmill. The trail has a length of about 2 km and can be used year-round.

The village also has an arena and community centre, as well as a library originally built in 1934 and financed by a private donation.

There are also numerous parks and green spaces.

<doc id="526544" wikidata="Q611919" url="?curid=526544" title="Shannon, County Clare">
<text>Shannon () or Shannon Town (), named after the river near which it stands, is a town in County Clare, Ireland. It was given town status on 1 January 1982. The town is located just off the N19 road, a spur of the N18/M18 road between Limerick and Ennis. It is the location of Shannon Airport, an international airport serving the Clare/Limerick region in the west of Ireland, as well as being the location of one of the two bases of Shanwick Oceanic Control which oversees transatlantic air traffic control over the western portion of the North Atlantic Ocean.

It has a population of 10,256 as per the 2022 census, the second largest town in the county.

==History==
Shannon is a new town. Spearheaded by Brendan O&#x27;Regan, it was built in the 1960s on reclaimed marshland alongside Shannon Airport, along with the Shannon Free Zone Industrial park. The residential areas were intended as a home for the thousands of workers at the airport, surrounding industries and support services. Population growth was never as fast as planned throughout the first few decades of the town&#x27;s existence. This was partly due to the proximity of &#x27;friendly&#x27; places to live, such as Ennis town and Limerick city, or even the nearby village of Newmarket-on-Fergus.

The &#x27;planned&#x27; nature of this town did not necessarily result in a successful town. It was lacking in facilities, and the town&#x27;s shopping centre was also of poor design. Shops fronted onto pedestrian malls that were originally uncovered, allowing estuary winds and rain to strike at shoppers. The early low-cost housing (tower-block flats located in Drumgeely, near the airport) was poor-quality terraced housing.

Shannon was originally located in the parish of Newmarket-on-Fergus in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe, and at first a priest in residence of the airport served the population. In 1966 St. Senan&#x27;s School was opened and Mary Immaculate Church was built on Corrib Drive. On 24 December 1967 the parish of Shannon was created. For a short period a group of Dominican Sisters of England had a community in the parish. In 1974 they were replaced by the Sisters of Mercy. The church of Saints John and Paul was opened in Tullyvarraga in 1980. 
Other churches are the Adoration Chapel in Shannon Town Centre and the Shannon Airport Oratory.
The Church of Ireland community is served by the Drumcliffe Union and the Methodist community is served by a lay pastor. Shannon is also home of Christian evangelical churches, Shannon Christian Church and New Life Christian Church.

St. John&#x27;s Church of Ireland School was the first school established in Shannon in 1962. Christ Church Shannon opened in 1962, also serving members of the reformed faiths, but it is now closed.

Shannon was the manufacturing base of GAC Ireland, which built almost all buses for CIÉ during its short existence between 1980 and 1986.

==Development==
The population grew in the 1990s, and new modern housing developments were built. Improvements to facilities in the town included the opening of a second major supermarket, Lidl, with the shopping centre being expanded by the addition of the &quot;Skycourt&quot; complex.

The main road through Shannon was remodelled following the opening of the bypass of Newmarket-on-Fergus. New units continued to open in the industrial estates.

== Education ==

Shannon town has six primary schools: St. Tola&#x27;s, St John&#x27;s, St Senan&#x27;s, Gaelscoil Donnacha Rua, St. Conaire&#x27;s (largest primary school) and St. Aidan&#x27;s, including a Gaelscoil (Gaelscoil Donncha Rua) and a school under the patronage of Church of Ireland (St. Johns NS).

There are two second-level education institutes in the town, St. Patrick&#x27;s Comprehensive School and St. Caimin&#x27;s Community School. St. Patrick&#x27;s Comprehensive School opened in 1966 as Ireland&#x27;s first comprehensive school. It has been serving the town since and is due an extension to increase its capacity to over 900 pupils.

There is one third level institution in Shannon: the Shannon College of Hotel Management, which opened in 1951. Since 2015 it has been an official college of the National University of Ireland, Galway.

==Economy==
Shannon Free Zone is Ireland&#x27;s largest cluster of North American investments. Since its establishment in 1959, more than 110 overseas companies have chosen to open subsidiaries in Shannon. Major companies in Shannon include Jaguar Land Rover, Zimmer Biomet, Element Six, Symantec, AXA Partners, Lufthansa Technik, Mentor Graphics, RSA Security, GE Capital, Ingersoll Rand, Intel and Digital River. Eirjet&#x27;s head office was located on the grounds of Shannon Airport.

==Local government and politics==
The town is administered at a local level by Clare County Council. In 1982, the town was granted local government under town commissioners. In 2002, this body became a town council. In 2008, the administrative boundary of the town was extended. In 2014, in common with all town councils in Ireland, it was abolished and its functions were transferred to the county council.

In addition, prior to September 2004, Shannon Development, a state-sponsored body had charge of many services normally provided by local authorities in Ireland. This gave Shannon a unique status in local governance. In September 2004 its situation was regularised when Shannon Development transferred its local government functions to Clare County Council. The company retains responsibility for the Shannon Free Zone.

<doc id="526546" wikidata="Q719681" url="?curid=526546" title="John Hiatt">
<text>John Robert Hiatt (born August 20, 1952) is an American singer-songwriter. He has played a variety of musical styles on his albums, including new wave, blues, and country. Hiatt has been nominated for nine Grammy Awards and has been awarded a variety of other distinctions in the music industry.

Hiatt was working as a songwriter for Tree International, a record label in Nashville, Tennessee, when his song &quot;Sure As I&#x27;m Sittin&#x27; Here&quot; was covered by Three Dog Night. The song became a Top 40 hit, earning Hiatt a recording contract with Epic Records. Since then he has released 22 studio albums, two compilation albums and one live album.

== Early life ==

Hiatt was born in 1952 to Robert and Ruth Hiatt, the sixth of seven children in a Roman Catholic family from Indianapolis, Indiana. When he was 9 years old, Hiatt&#x27;s 21-year-old brother Michael died by suicide. Two years later, his father died after a long illness. To escape the stress of his early life, Hiatt watched IndyCar racing and listened to Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, and the blues. In his youth, Hiatt reports that he and several others stole a Ford Thunderbird, a crime for which he was caught by the owners but got away with posing as a hitchhiker. He learned to play the guitar when he was 11 and began his musical career in Indianapolis as a teenager. He played in various local clubs such as the Hummingbird and also with bands, including The Four-Fifths and John Lynch &amp; the Hangmen.

== Career ==
Hiatt moved to Nashville, Tennessee, when he was 18 years old and got a job as a songwriter for the Tree-Music Publishing Company for $25 a week (equivalent to about $203 in 2024). Hiatt, who was unable to read or write scores, had to record all 250 songs he wrote for the company. In 1972 he also began playing with the band White Duck as one of three singer-songwriters within the group. White Duck had already recorded one album before Hiatt joined. He wrote and performed two songs on their second album &quot;In Season&quot;. Hiatt performed live in many clubs around Nashville with White Duck and also as a solo act.

=== Early solo career (1974–78) ===
Hiatt met Don Ellis of Epic Records in 1973, and received a record deal, releasing his first single &quot;We Make Spirit&quot; later that year. That same year Hiatt wrote the song &quot;Sure as I&#x27;m Sitting Here&quot; recorded by Three Dog Night, which went to number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in 1974.

In 1974, Hiatt released &quot;Hangin&#x27; Around the Observatory&quot;, which was a critical success but a commercial failure. A year later, &quot;Overcoats&quot; was released and when it also failed to sell, Epic Records released Hiatt from his contract. For the next four years he was without a recording contract. During this time his style evolved from country-rock to new wave of Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe and Graham Parker, among others.

=== MCA/Geffen years (1979–1986) ===
Hiatt was picked up by the MCA label in 1979. He released two albums for the label – &quot;Slug Line&quot; (1979) and &quot;Two Bit Monsters&quot; (1980) – neither of which met with commercial success. He received a few good reviews for these albums by critics in the Netherlands. He performed at Paradiso in Amsterdam for the first time in 1979 (opening for Southside Johnny &amp; The Asbury Jukes) and came back often and built a solid fan base. In 1982, &quot;Across the Borderline&quot;, written by Hiatt with Ry Cooder and Jim Dickinson, appeared on the soundtrack to the motion picture &quot;The Border&quot;, sung by country star Freddy Fender. The song was later covered on albums by Willie Nelson, Paul Young, Rubén Blades and Willy DeVille, among others, as well as by Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan in concert. 

Hiatt was signed in 1982 to Geffen (which later absorbed MCA), where he recorded three diverse albums from 1982 to 1985. The first, &quot;All of a Sudden&quot;, was produced by Tony Visconti, and featured use of keyboards and synthesizers; his future albums combined country and soul influences. &quot;Riding with the King&quot; appeared in 1983, produced by Scott Mathews, Ron Nagle and Nick Lowe. Hiatt began making &quot;critics choice&quot; lists and building a large European following. The title track of &quot;Riding with the King&quot; (taken from an odd dream Scott Mathews had) was re-recorded two decades later by Eric Clapton and B. B. King and went double platinum.

During this period, Rosanne Cash covered several Hiatt compositions, taking &quot;It Hasn&#x27;t Happened Yet&quot; to the Top 20 on the country charts. In 1983, Cash did a duet with Hiatt on his &quot;The Way We Make a Broken Heart&quot; produced by Nick Lowe. When Geffen failed to release the single, Cash re-recorded it in 1987 and it went to No. 1 on the US country charts. It was during this time that Asleep at the Wheel covered the song. Ricky Nelson covered &quot;It Hasn&#x27;t Happened Yet&quot; on his 1981 album &quot;Playing to Win&quot;.

Hiatt recorded a duet with Elvis Costello, a cover version of the Spinners&#x27; song &quot;Living a Little, Laughing a Little&quot;, which appeared on &quot;Warming Up to the Ice Age&quot;. Shortly after its release, Bob Dylan covered Hiatt&#x27;s song &quot;The Usual&quot;, which had appeared on the soundtrack to &quot;Hearts of Fire&quot;. However, Geffen dropped Hiatt from the label after &quot;Ice Age&quot; failed to chart.

=== Success (1987–1989) ===
Hiatt finally came into success in 1987, when he released &quot;Bring the Family&quot;. For the album, Hiatt had a backing band consisting of Ry Cooder, Nick Lowe, and Jim Keltner. Two of the songs on the album have been extensively covered: &quot;Have a Little Faith in Me,&quot; which has been interpreted by a number of artists, including Joe Cocker, Delbert McClinton, Jewel, Bill Frisell, Mandy Moore and Bon Jovi; and &quot;Memphis in the Meantime&quot;, which has been covered by Carl Perkins, Chris Smither, Spafford, and Gregg Allman. &quot;Thank You Girl&quot; was a moderate radio hit, and the B-side of the single featured a non-album duet with Loudon Wainwright III on a cover of the Temptations’ hit &quot;My Girl&quot; (Hiatt returned the favor on the B-side of Wainwright&#x27;s single &quot;Your Mother and I&quot;). Most notably, Bonnie Raitt brought &quot;Thing Called Love&quot; to No. 11 on the US charts with her 1989 release &quot;Nick of Time&quot;.

Following &quot;Bring the Family&quot;, Hiatt had a string of nine straight studio albums which hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In 1988, he returned to the studio with Glyn Johns producing to record &quot;Slow Turning&quot;, which was his first album to hit the upper half of the Billboard 200. It featured his only top 10 chart single, the title track, which hit No. 8 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and &quot;Tennessee Plates&quot;, which was used in the soundtrack of the Ridley Scott directed and Academy Award-winning film &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot; in 1991. The Jeff Healey Band covered the Hiatt-penned song &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; and took it to the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

=== 1990s and beyond ===

In 1992, Cooder, Keltner, and Lowe again backed up Hiatt, but this time they gave themselves the band name Little Village, a reference to a Sonny Boy Williamson II song. Expectations for the &quot;Little Village&quot; album were high, but the album failed to even chart as high as Hiatt&#x27;s last solo album. The group disbanded after a moderately successful tour. Conversely, country artist Suzy Bogguss scored a No. 2 hit that year with a cover of Hiatt&#x27;s song &quot;Drive South.&quot;

Hiatt recorded &quot;Perfectly Good Guitar&quot; with members of alternative rock groups School of Fish and Wire Train in 1993. Hiatt recorded the album with producer Matt Wallace, who had worked most prominently with Faith No More, a band that Hiatt&#x27;s 15-year-old stepson had recommended for him. It was Hiatt&#x27;s highest-peaking album at No. 47, but was not the commercial breakthrough A&amp;M expected.

Also in 1993, &quot;Love Gets Strange: The Songs of John Hiatt,&quot; a compilation album of covers of Hiatt&#x27;s songs, was released. This was followed by an album of original covers &quot;Rollin&#x27; into Memphis: Songs of John Hiatt&quot; in 2000, and a second compilation album with a few originals, titled &quot;It&#x27;ll Come To You...The Songs of John Hiatt,&quot; in 2003.

In 1994, Hiatt released &quot;Hiatt Comes Alive at Budokan?&quot;, his first official live album and his last album with A&amp;M Records. A CD and DVD of his performance on &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; was released in 2005. Hiatt previously released two promotional live promotional &quot;official bootlegs&quot;, &quot;Riot with Hiatt&quot; in 1985, and &quot;Live at the Hiatt&quot; in 1993, as well as the EP &quot;Live at the Palace&quot; in 1991. Hiatt received his first Grammy nomination in 1995 for his album &quot;Walk On&quot;. 

In 2000, Hiatt released his first independent album on Vanguard Records, &quot;Crossing Muddy Waters&quot;, which saw a heavy influence of bluegrass in his music. Later that year, he was named songwriter/artist of the year at the Nashville Music Awards. In 2001, &quot;Crossing Muddy Waters&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, with Davey Faragher and David Immerglück as his only accompanists. In 2002, Hiatt performed several songs for the soundtrack of the Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Country Bears&quot; movie, again with Johns producing, representing the voice of the lead singer. The movie featured covers of Hiatt songs by Bonnie Raitt and Don Henley.

Hiatt&#x27;s next album, &quot;Master of Disaster&quot;, was released on June 21, 2005. The album was produced by Jim Dickinson, and Hiatt was backed up by the bassist David Hood and several members of the North Mississippi Allstars. The album achieved modest sales, becoming a top 10 independent album, but failed to achieve significant commercial success.

On February 12, 2008, during a concert with Lyle Lovett at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, Ontario, Hiatt said that his new album would be titled &quot;Same Old Man&quot;. It was released on May 27, 2008.

On September 17, 2008, he appeared in Levon Helm&#x27;s Ramble at the Ryman singing &quot;The Weight&quot; at the historic Ryman Auditorium, in Nashville.

Hiatt appeared as a performer in &quot;The House of Blues&quot; in the sixth episode of the second season of &quot;Treme&quot;, with the episode title taken from his song &quot;Feels Like Rain&quot;. The episode aired May 29, 2011. 

Hiatt presented an Americana Lifetime Achievement Award to Bonnie Raitt on September 12, 2012. The two performed &quot;Thing Called Love&quot; together at the ceremony.

On July 15, 2014, Hiatt released &quot;Terms of My Surrender&quot;, his 22nd studio album. It earned him two Grammy nominations.

On October 12, 2018, Hiatt released &quot;The Eclipse Sessions&quot;, an LP via New West Records. The album, his first in four years, was recorded over four days in the summer of 2017, a period that included the August 21 solar eclipse. Hiatt recorded the album as part of a trio of guitar, bass (Patrick O’Hearn), and drums (Kenneth Blevins).

== Personal life ==
Hiatt has two daughters, singer-songwriter Lilly Hiatt and Georgia Rae Hiatt, and a stepson, Robert.

<doc id="526549" wikidata="Q30004" url="?curid=526549" title="Evenki language">
<text>Evenki ( ), formerly known as Tungus, is the largest member of the northern group of Tungusic languages, a group which also includes Even, Negidal, and the more closely related Oroqen language. The name is sometimes wrongly given as &quot;Evenks&quot;. It is spoken by the Evenki or Ewenkī(s) in Russia and China.

In certain areas the influences of the Yakut and the Buryat languages are particularly strong. The influence of Russian in general is overwhelming (in 1979, 75.2% of the Evenkis spoke Russian, rising to 92.7% in 2002). Evenki children were forced to learn Russian at Soviet residential schools, and returned with a &quot;poor ability to speak their mother tongue...&quot;. The Evenki language varies considerably among its dialects, which are divided into three large groups: the northern, the southern and the eastern dialects. These are further divided into minor dialects. A written language was created for Evenkis in the Soviet Union in 1931, first using a Latin alphabet, and from 1937 a Cyrillic one. In China, Evenki is written experimentally in the Mongolian script. The language is generally considered endangered.

==Genetic affiliation==
Evenki is a member of the Tungusic family. Its similarity to Manchu, the best-documented member of the family, was noted hundreds of years ago, first by botanist P. S. Pallas in the late 18th century, and then in a more formal linguistic study by M. A. Castren in the mid-19th century, regarded as a &quot;pioneer treatise&quot; in the field of Tungusology. The exact internal structure of the Tungusic family is a matter of some debate. Some scholars propose two sub-families: one for Manchu, and another for all the other Tungusic languages, including Evenki. SIL International&#x27;s Ethnologue divides Tungusic into two sub-families, Northern and Southern, with Evenki alongside Even and Negidal in the Northern sub-family, and the Southern family itself subdivided into Southwestern (among which Manchu) and Southeastern (Nanai and others). Others propose three or more sub-families, or at the extreme a continuum with Manchu at one end and Evenki at the other.

==Dialects==
Bulatova enumerated 14 dialects and 50 sub-dialects within Russia, spread over a wide geographical area ranging from the Yenisei River to Sakhalin. These may be divided into three major groups primarily on the basis of phonology:
*Evenki
**Northern (spirant)
***Ilimpeya: Ilimpeya, Agata and Bol&#x27;shoi, Porog, Tura, Tutonchany, Dudinka/Khantai
***Yerbogachen: Yerbogachen, Nakanno
**Southern (sibilant)
***Hushing
****Sym: Tokma or Upper Nepa, Upper Lena or Kachug, Angara
****Northern Baikal: Northern Baikal, Upper Lena
***Hissing
****Stony Tunguska: Vanavara, Kuyumba, Poligus, Surinda, Taimura or Chirinda, Uchami, Chemdal&#x27;sk
****Nepa: Nepa, Kirensk
****Vitim-Nercha/Baunt-Talocha: Baunt, Talocha, Tungokochen, Nercha
**Eastern (sibilant-spirant)
***Vitim-Olyokma dialect: Barguzin, Vitim/Kalar, Olyokma, Tungir, Tokko
***Upper Aldan: Aldan, Upper Amur, Amga, Dzheltulak, Timpton, Tommot, Khingan, Chul&#x27;man, Chul&#x27;man-Gilyui
***Uchur-Zeya: Uchur, Zeya
***Selemdzha-Bureya-Urmi: Selemdzha, Bureya, Urmi
***Ayan-Mai: Ayan, Aim, Mai, Nel&#x27;kan, Totti
***Tugur-Chumikan: Tugur, Chumikan
***Sakhalin (no subdialects)
Evenks in China also speak several dialects. According to Ethnologue, the Hihue or Hoy dialect is considered the standard; Haila&#x27;er, Aoluguya (Olguya), Chenba&#x27;erhu (Old Bargu), and Morigele (Mergel) dialects also exist. Ethnologue reports these dialects differ significantly from those in Russia.

Some works focused on individual Russia dialects include (Barguzin), (Tommot), and (Sakhalin).

==Phonology==
The Evenki language typically has CV syllables but other structures are possible. Bulatova and Grenoble list Evenki as having 11 possible vowel phonemes; a classical five-vowel system with distinctions between long and short vowels (except in ) and the addition of a long and short , while Nedjalkov claims that there are 13 vowel phonemes. Evenki has a moderately small consonant inventory; there are 18 consonants (21 according to Nedjalkov 1997) in the Evenki language and it lacks glides or semivowels.

===Consonants===
Below are tables of Evenki consonant phonemes, including those identified by Nedjalkov (1997) in italics.

The phoneme () has a word-final allophone, , as well as an intervocalic variant, . Likewise, some speakers pronounce intervocalic as . Speakers of some dialects also alternate and . Consonant inventories given by researchers working on dialects in China are largely similar. The differences noted: Chaoke and Kesingge &quot;et al.&quot; give instead of and lack , , or ; furthermore, Kesingge &quot;et al.&quot; give instead of .

=== Vowels ===
Below is a chart of Evenki vowels found among Russian dialects, including those identified by Nedjalkov (1997) in italics.
The vowel inventory of the Chinese dialects of Evenki, however, is markedly different (Chaoke, 1995, 2009):
Like most Tungusic languages, Evenki employs back-front vowel harmony—suffix vowels are matched to the vowel in the root. However, some vowels – – and certain suffixes no longer adhere to the rules of vowel harmony. Knowledge of the rules of vowel harmony is fading, as vowel harmony is a complex topic for elementary speakers to grasp, the language is severely endangered (Janhunen), and many speakers are multilingual.

===Syllable structure===
Possible syllable structures include V, VC, VCC, CV, CVC, and CVCC. In contrast to dialects in Russia, dialects in China do not have /k/, /ŋ/, or /r/ in word-initial position.

==Alphabets==
===Russia===
The creation of the Evenki alphabet began in the 1920s. In May 1928, researcher prepared for the Evenk students who studied in Leningrad the &quot;Memo to Tungus-vacationers&quot;. It was a small textbook duplicated on the glass. It used the Vasilyevich Evenki alphabet on a Latin graphic basis. A year later, she compiled the &quot;First Book for Reading in the Tungus Language&quot; (). This alphabet had the following composition: &quot;Aa Bb Çç HH Dd Ӡӡ Ee Әә Gg Hh Ii Kk Ll Mm Nn Ŋŋ Oo Pp Rr Ss Tt Uu Ww Yy&quot;; it also included diacritical marks: a macron to indicate the longitude of the sound and a sub-letter comma to indicate palatalization.

In 1930, it was decided to create a written language for the majority of the peoples of the North of the USSR. The Latin alphabet was chosen as its graphic basis. In the same year, the project of the Evenki alphabet was proposed by Ya. P. Alcor. This project differed from Vasilevich&#x27;s alphabet only by the presence of letters for displaying Russian borrowings (&quot;C c, F f, J j, W w, Z z&quot;), as well as using &quot;V v&quot; instead of &quot;W w&quot;. After some refinement, the letter &quot;Çç&quot; was replaced by &quot;C c&quot;, &quot;V v&quot; by &quot;W w&quot;, and the letter &quot;Y y&quot; was excluded. In May 1931, the Evenki romanized alphabet was officially approved, and in 1932 regular publishing began on it. The basis of the literary language was laid the most studied Nepsky dialect (north of the Irkutsk region).

The official Latinized Evenk alphabet, in which book publishing and schooling were conducted, looked like this:

Today, the official writing system in Russia for the Evenki language is the Cyrillic script. The script has one additional letter, ӈ, to indicate ; it is used only inconsistently in printed works, due to typographical limitations. Boldyrev&#x27;s dictionary uses ң instead. Some editions use the digraph нг. Other sounds found in Evenki but not Russian, such as , lack devoted letters. Instead д stands in for both and ; when the latter pronunciation is intended, it is followed by one of Cyrillic&#x27;s iotated letters, similar to the way those letters cause palatalization of the preceding consonant in Russian. However orthographic decisions like these have resulted in some confusion and transfer of Russian phonetics to Evenki among younger speakers. For example, the spellings ди and ды were intended to record and (i.e. the same vowel sound). However, in Russian и and ы are respectively two different vowels, and . Long vowels are optionally indicated with macrons.

===China===
In the &quot;Imperial History of the National Languages of Liao, Jin, and Yuan&quot; () commissioned by the Qianlong Emperor, the Manchu alphabet is used to write Evenki words.

Evenki in China is now written in the Latin script and experimentally in the Mongolian script. Evenki scholars made an attempt in the 1980s to create standard written forms for their language, using both Mongolian script and a pinyin-like Latin spelling. They published an Evenki–Mongolian–Chinese dictionary () with Evenki words spelled in IPA, a pinyin-like orthography, and Mongolian script, as well as a collection of folk songs in IPA and Mongolian script (and Chinese-style numbered musical notation).

The orthographic system developed by Chinese Evenki scholars reflects differences between Evenki and Mongol phonology. It uses both and (usually romanised from Mongolian as &quot;q&quot; and &quot;ɣ&quot;) for . The system uses double letters in both Mongolian and Latin to represent most long vowels; however for &quot;ao&quot; is written instead of &quot;oo&quot;. The same scholars&#x27; collection of songs has some orthographic differences from the table below; namely, long vowels are occasionally written not just doubled but also with an intervening silent (&quot;ɣ&quot;), showing clear orthographic influence from the Mongolian language. In medial and final positions, &quot;t&quot; is written in the Manchu script form . &quot;Evenki&quot; itself is spelled , despite Mongolian orthography usually prohibiting the letter combination &quot;ŋk&quot;. The vowel inventory of this system is also rather different from that of Chaoke (1995, 2009).

 uses a different version of Latin script, which distinguishes certain vowels and consonants more clearly than the system of Kesingge &quot;et al.&quot;:
== Morphology ==

Evenki is highly agglutinating and suffixing: Each morpheme is easily recognizable and carries only one piece of meaning. Evenki pronouns distinguish between singular and plural as well as inclusive and exclusive in the first person. The Evenki language has a rich case system — 13 cases, though there is some variation among dialects — and it is a nominative–accusative language. Evenki differentiates between alienable and inalienable possession: alienable possession marks the possessor in the nominative case and the possessum in the possessed case, while inalienable possession is marked by personal indices.

Below is a table of cases and suffixes in Evenki, following Nedjalkov (1997):

&lt;section begin=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;
LOCDIR:locative-directive case
ALLLOC:allative-locative case
ACD:accusative case, definite
PRO:prolative case
INS:instrumental case
SEM:semblative case
POS:possessed
&lt;section end=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;
Plurals are marked with &quot;-il-&quot;, &quot;-l-&quot;, or &quot;-r-&quot; before the case marker, if any:

==Syntax==
Evenki is a subject–object–verb and head-final language. The subject is marked according to the nominative case, and the object is in the accusative. In Evenki, the indirect object precedes the direct object.

==Literary traditions==
The Manchu script was used to write Evenki (Solon) words in the &quot;Imperial History of the National Languages of Liao, Jin, and Yuan&quot;. The Evenki did not have their own writing system until the introduction of the Latin script in 1931 and the subsequent change to Cyrillic in 1936–7. The literary language was first based on the Nepa dialect of the Southern subgroup, but in the 1950s was redesigned with the Stony Tunguska dialect as its basis. Ethnographer S. M. Shirokogoroff harshly criticised the &quot;child-like&quot; literary language, and in a 1930s monograph predicted it would quickly go extinct. Although textbooks through the 8th grade have been published, &quot;Literary Evenki has not yet achieved the status of a norm which cut across dialects and is understood by speakers of some dialects with great difficulty&quot;. However, despite its failure to gain widespread acceptance, within its dialectal base of roughly 5,000 people, it survived and continues in use up to the present. Since the 1930s, &quot;folklore, novels, poetry, numerous translations from Russian and other languages&quot;, textbooks, and dictionaries have all been written in Evenki. In Tura (former administrative center of the Evenk Autonomous Okrug), the local newspaper includes a weekly supplement written in Evenki.

==Language shift and multilingualism==
There is a large quantity of Russian loan words in Evenki, especially for technologies and concepts that were introduced by the Russian pioneers in Siberia. &quot;Evenki is spoken in regions with heavy multilingualism. In their daily life the people come into contact with Russian, Buriat and Yakut, and each of these languages had affected the Evenki language. Russian is the lingua franca of the region, part of the Evenki population is bilingual, and part trilingual. All Evenki know Russian relatively well.&quot; In 1998 there were approximately 30,000 ethnic Evenkis living in Russia and about 1/3 of them spoke the language. Even a decade ago Bulatova was trying to warn speakers and linguists alike: &quot;There is widespread loss of Evenki and the language can be considered seriously endangered&quot;. According to the 2002 Russian census, there were 35,527 citizens of the Russian Federation who identified themselves as ethnically Evenki, but only 7,580 speakers of the language. In 2021, there were 39,226 people who identified themselves as Evenki, but only 5,831 speakers of the language.

In China, there is an ethnic population of 30,500 but only 19,000 are fluent in Evenki and only around 3,000 people are monolingual in Evenki. Juha Janhunen investigated multilingualism in Hulunbuir (northern Inner Mongolia) and the adjoining section of Heilongjiang (e.g. Qiqihar) in 1996. He found that most Solons still spoke Evenki, and about half knew the Daur language as well. Furthermore, Mongolian functioned as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; among members of all minority groups there, as they tended to do their education in Mongolian-medium schools. The only Evenki-speakers whom Janhunen knew not to speak Mongolian as a second language were the Reindeer Evenki (sometimes called &quot;Yakut&quot;) in the northern part of Hulunbuir, who used Russian as their &quot;language of intercultural communication&quot;. Janhunen predicted that all of these languages, including Mongolian, were likely to lose ground to Chinese in coming years. However Chaoke noted more than a decade later that the usage rate of Evenki remained quite high, and that it was still common to find Evenki speakers who were proficient in three, four, or even five languages.

There is a small population of Mongolized Hamnigan speakers of the Hamnigan dialect of Buryat in Mongolia as well, numbering around 1,000.

There is little information regarding revival efforts or Evenki&#x27;s status now. In 1998, the language was taught in preschools and primary schools and offered as an option in 8th grade. The courses were regarded as an &#x27;ethnocultural component&#x27; to bring Evenki language and culture into the curriculum. Instruction as a second language is also available in the Institute of the Peoples of the North at Herzen University (the former St. Petersburg State Pedagogical University). In the 1980s, Christian missionaries working in Siberia translated the Bible into Evenki and a Christian group called the Global Recordings Network recorded Christian teaching materials in Evenki.

<text>The TVR Tuscan Speed Six is a sports car which was manufactured by British company TVR from 1999 to 2006. The name pays homage to the original Tuscan which was introduced in 1967.

==History==

The Tuscan Speed Six was introduced in 1999 and was available for media demonstration in 2000. The reason being then owner Peter Wheeler imposing a ban on press reviews of the car. Initially, the Tuscan Speed Six was fitted with the 4.0 litre version of the TVR Speed Six engine rated at at 7,000 rpm and of torque at 5,250 rpm. Later, a Red Rose pack option raised the power output to , bringing with it track-focused chassis upgrades as well as an AP Racing braking system. The high performance Tuscan S was the top-of-the-line model rated at and had aerodynamic improvements over the base models, most notably a rear lip spoiler to improve downforce. 

The Tuscan Speed Six underwent a facelift in 2005 and was now called the Tuscan 2. Exterior changes featured a redesigned front grille and headlamps along with more conventional taillamps. Mechanical changes involved revised spring rates, improved steering response and different suspension geometry to make the car easier to drive on public roads. The base models were detuned to and while still retaining the basic weight figure of . The interior was also refreshed and featured a more conventional and ergonomic layout. Production lasted until the closure of TVR in 2006.

==Specifications==
===Engine===
Five different inline-six engine options were offered to customers. Four of these were variants of the naturally aspirated 4.0 L &quot;Speed Six&quot; fuel fed by multipoint fuel injection making different amounts of power and torque, depending on the trim level selected. The last was a 3.6 L &quot;Speed Six&quot; which produced the same amount of power as the lowest-level 4.0 L engine, although slightly less torque.

===Chassis===

Even though there have been numerous tweaks to the Tuscan&#x27;s chassis and suspension, the overall size and appearance of the variants remain virtually identical apart from minor aerodynamic aids to the S model in the form of an undertray in the front and a small boot-lid spoiler on the rear.

In October 2005 the &quot;Mk 2&quot; version of the Tuscan was introduced, though in reality this was just a minor facelift. The modifications were restricted to cosmetic changes to the front and rear lights, the dashboard, and the spoilers on the S model plus some minor changes to the chassis to improve the handling. At the same time, a new variant a full soft top was introduced alongside the original targa version.

===Performance===
* 0–30 mph (48 km/h): 1.72 s
* 0–60 mph (97 km/h): 3.68 s
* 0–100 mph (161 km/h): 8.08 s
* 100–0 mph: 4.15 s

These test results were achieved in a post-2003 Tuscan S without traction-control or anti-lock brakes. TVR&#x27;s design philosophy holds that such features do not improve either the performance or safety of their vehicles and thus they are not so equipped. TVR rejects the notion that these features, along with airbags, are &quot;safety devices&quot; and believes that, based on testing and experience, their cars are safer without these things than with them.

A modified version of the car was used in the 2003 24 Hours of Le Mans, and again the following year.

<text>Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes were an American soul and R&amp;B vocal group. One of the most popular Philadelphia soul groups of the 1970s, the group&#x27;s repertoire included soul, R&amp;B, doo-wop, and disco. Founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the middle of the 1950s as The Charlemagnes, the group is most noted for several hits on Gamble and Huff&#x27;s Philadelphia International label between 1972 and 1976, although they performed and recorded until Melvin&#x27;s death in 1997. Despite group founder and original lead singer Harold Melvin&#x27;s top billing, the Blue Notes&#x27; most famous member was Teddy Pendergrass, their lead singer during the successful years at Philadelphia International. The remaining members of the Blue Notes have reunited for Soul Train Cruises in 2013, 2015, and 2017.

==History==
===Early years===
The group formerly known as The Charlemagnes took on the name &quot;The Blue Notes&quot; in 1954, with a line-up consisting of lead singer Franklin Peaker, Bernard Williams, Roosevelt Brodie, Jesse Gillis, Jr., and Harold Melvin. The group recorded for a number of labels without success from its inception into the 1960s. The 1960 single &quot;My Hero&quot; was a minor hit for Val-ue Records, and 1965&#x27;s &quot;Get Out (and Let Me Cry)&quot; was an R&amp;B hit for Landa Records. During this period, the group&#x27;s line-up changed frequently, with Bernard Williams leaving the act to start a group called &quot;The Original Blue Notes&quot;, and Harold Melvin bringing in new lead singer John Atkins. In 1970, the group recruited Teddy Pendergrass as the drummer for their backing band. Pendergrass had been a member of Philadelphia R&amp;B group The Cadillacs (not the New York group that had hits in the late 1950s) and was promoted to lead singer when John Atkins quit the same year.

===Philadelphia International success and Pendergrass Years===
This line-up of the group, featuring Melvin, Pendergrass, Bernard Wilson, Lawrence Brown, and Lloyd Parks, was signed to Gamble &amp; Huff&#x27;s Philadelphia International label in 1972. Lloyd Parks was replaced by Jerry Cummings that same year. Shortly after the arrival of Cummings, the Notes scored several major R&amp;B and pop hits including million-selling singles and albums over the next four years. Among the Blue Notes&#x27; most important and successful recordings are love songs such as 1972&#x27;s &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Know Me by Now&quot; (number 1 Billboard R&amp;B, number 3 pop), their breakout single, &quot;I Miss You&quot; (number 7 R&amp;B, number 58 pop), &quot;The Love I Lost&quot; (number 1 R&amp;B, number 7 pop, 1973) and socially conscious songs such as &quot;Wake Up Everybody&quot; (number 1 R&amp;B, number 12 pop) and &quot;Bad Luck&quot; (number 4 R&amp;B, number 15 pop), both in 1975. &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Know Me By Now&quot; sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA on November 21, 1972. &quot;Bad Luck&quot; holds the record for the longest-running number-one hit on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart: 11 weeks. A fourth number 1 R&amp;B hit for the group was 1975&#x27;s &quot;Hope That We Can Be Together Soon&quot; which featured female vocalist Sharon Paige.

A 1976 remake of &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot; by Motown artist Thelma Houston was a number-one hit on the US pop chart. The Blue Notes&#x27; version on the album, &quot;Wake Up Everybody&quot;, was not released as a single in the US at the time, but proved to be the group&#x27;s biggest hit in the UK (number 5) when released there as a single in 1977. The track was finally issued as a single in the US on 12-inch in 1979, coupled with &quot;Bad Luck&quot;. The group recorded four albums with Gamble &amp; Huff, all of them going gold (over 500,000 copies), according to RIAA, including &quot;To Be True&quot; (number 26, Billboard Top 40 albums) and &quot;Wake Up Everybody&quot; (number 9), both in 1975. &quot;Wake Up Everybody&quot; and a greatest hits compilation released in 1976, &quot;Collector&#x27;s Item&quot;, has now sold over a million copies.

Despite the success, the Blue Notes&#x27; line-up continued to change regularly. In 1972, Melvin brought in Jerry Cummings to replace Lloyd Parks and Sharon Paige was added to the line-up at that time, providing solo performances on several recordings. While at the top of their success in 1976, Pendergrass quit after an argument over the money he earned. A year earlier, he had gained billing recognition by having the act renamed to &quot;Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes featuring Theodore Pendergrass&quot;, starting from the &quot;To be True&quot; album. Pendergrass went on to a successful solo career, with four consecutive million-selling albums with Philadelphia International between 1977 and 1981. His career was almost ended by a paralyzing 1982 car accident. He made a triumphant comeback in 1984, signing with Asylum/Elektra Records, and recording the hit LP &quot;Love Language&quot; and then the platinum-selling &quot;Joy&quot; LP, released in 1988, which featured the Grammy-nominated title song, an R&amp;B number 1; his comeback was cemented by an appearance at the Live Aid concert in 1985.

===Post Pendergrass years===
Melvin replaced Pendergrass with David Ebo. The Blue Notes departed Philadelphia International (who had signed Pendergrass for solo recordings) and joined ABC Records in 1977, where they recorded two albums produced by Melvin. &quot;Reaching for the World&quot; (number 7 R&amp;B, number 74 pop) became the group&#x27;s last major-selling single. Harold Melvin, Jerry Cummings, and new members Dwight Johnson, David Ebo and William Spratley released &quot;The Blue Album&quot; in 1980 on Source Records, an imprint of MCA Records, which had acquired ABC Records in 1979. Their final album for MCA, &quot;All Things Happen in Time&quot;, was released in 1981.

Gil Saunders took the lead position in 1982, replacing David Ebo. With Gil Saunders, the group had success in the United Kingdom with the Philly World album &quot;Talk It Up (Tell Everybody)&quot;, and singles such as &quot;Today&#x27;s Your Lucky Day&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Me Up&quot;. Several of the Pendergrass-era hits were re-recorded in the UK with Gil Saunders on lead. Saunders left the act in 1992, and Harold Melvin continued to tour with various line-ups of Blue Notes, until suffering a stroke in 1996.

Melvin died on March 24, 1997, at the age of 57 and was laid to rest at the Ivy Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. Lawrence Brown died of a respiratory condition on April 6, 2008, at age 63. In addition, three former members of the group would die during the year 2010. First, Teddy Pendergrass died of respiratory failure on January 13, 2010, at age 59, after having previously dealt with colon cancer. Six months later, original member Roosevelt Brodie, who was the second tenor for the original Blue Notes, died July 13, 2010, at age 75 due to complications of diabetes. And just five months later in that year, Bernard Wilson died on December 26, 2010, at age 64 from complications of a stroke and a heart attack. Pendergrass&#x27; predecessor, John Atkins, died of an aneurysm in 1998. David Ebo, who succeeded Pendergrass, died of bone cancer on November 30, 1993, at age 43. The death of Sharon Paige was reported on July 5, 2020. Gil Saunders died on February 4, 2021.

Lloyd Parks, Jerry Cummings, and Bobby Cook are the sole survivors of the Blue Notes.

===Legacy===
Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes hits have been re-recorded by other artists, including David Ruffin, Simply Red, Jimmy Somerville, Sybil, the Three Degrees and John Legend, while dance music DJ Danny Rampling cites &quot;Wake Up Everybody&quot; as his favorite song of all time. Gil Saunders continued to perform as a solo artist, and performed all the hits of the past as well as his own material. Several members of various incarnations of the Blue Notes continue to tour as &quot;Harold Melvin&#x27;s Blue Notes&quot;. Melvin&#x27;s widow, Ovelia currently manages Harold Melvin&#x27;s Blue Notes, featuring lead singer Donnell &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Gillespie, Anthony Brooks, Rufus Thorne and John Morris. For his album &quot;This Note&#x27;s for You&quot;, singer Neil Young named his back-up band, the Blue Notes, without permission from name rights holder Harold Melvin. Melvin took legal action against Young over use of the Blue Notes name, forcing the singer to change the name of the back-up band to &quot;Ten Men Workin&#x27;&quot; during the balance of the tour that promoted the &quot;This Note&#x27;s for You&quot; album.

The band is mentioned on Snoop Dogg&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Doggystyle&quot;. In the intro for &quot;Doggy Dogg World&quot; Snoop says &quot;Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without the Blue Notes, you&#x27;ll never go platinum!&quot; Former member Jerry Cummings is an ordained minister and has been asked to form Jerry Cummings&#x27; Blue Notes but has turned down the offer. As of May 2014 Jerry Cummings became the Music Life Coach and producer of the X Factor superstar Lillie McCloud and Lillie has recorded one of Cummings&#x27; songs &quot;The Other Part of Me&quot;. Rapper Big Boi uses a sample of &quot;I Miss You&quot; on his song &quot;Shine Blockas&quot; feat. Gucci Mane. &quot;I Miss You&quot; was also sampled by Kanye West on Jay-Z&#x27;s song &quot;This Can&#x27;t Be Life&quot;, featuring Beanie Sigel and Scarface. Also the R&amp;B singer Pleasure P used a sample of &quot;I Miss You&quot; on his song &quot;Letter to My Ex&quot; recorded in 2013.

Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2007.

Neil Young named his This Note&#x27;s for You backing band The Bluenotes, however, Harold Melvin took legal action, and the album subsequently was credited as a Young solo album, with the backing band&#x27;s credits removed.

<text>Donny Edward Hathaway (October 1, 1945 – January 13, 1979) was an American soul singer, keyboardist, songwriter, backing vocalist, and arranger who &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described as a &quot;soul legend&quot;. His most popular songs include &quot;The Ghetto&quot;, &quot;This Christmas&quot;, &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll All Be Free&quot;, and &quot;Little Ghetto Boy&quot;. Hathaway is also renowned for his renditions of &quot;A Song for You&quot;, &quot;For All We Know&quot;, &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; and &quot;I Love You More Than You&#x27;ll Ever Know&quot;, along with &quot;Where Is the Love&quot; and &quot;The Closer I Get to You&quot;, two of many collaborations with Roberta Flack. He has been inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame and won one Grammy Award from four nominations. Hathaway was also posthumously honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019. Dutch director David Kleijwegt made a documentary called &quot;Mister Soul – A Story About Donny Hathaway&quot;, which premiered at the International Film Festival Rotterdam on January 28, 2020.

==Early life==
Hathaway, the son of Drusella Huntley, was born into an African American family in Chicago, Illinois, and was raised by his grandmother, Martha Pitts, also known as Martha Crumwell, in the Carr Square housing project of St. Louis, Missouri. Hathaway began singing in the church choir with his grandmother, a professional gospel singer, at the age of three, and studying piano. He graduated from Vashon High School in 1963. Hathaway then studied music on a fine arts scholarship at Howard University in Washington, D.C., where he met his roommate and drummer Ric Powell, who ultimately launched Donny&#x27;s musical career as a member of &quot;The Ric Powell Trio&quot;. At Howard, he was also a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, but during 1967, just before completing a degree, Donny and Ric left Howard after receiving job offers in the music business with the likes of Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s Curtom Records in Chicago.

==Career==
Hathaway worked as a songwriter, session musician, and producer for Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s Curtom Records in Chicago. He did the arrangements for hits by the Unifics (&quot;Court of Love&quot; and &quot;The Beginning of My End&quot;) and took part in projects by the Staple Singers, Jerry Butler, Aretha Franklin, the Impressions and Curtis Mayfield himself. After becoming a &quot;house producer&quot; at Curtom, he started recording there. Hathaway recorded his first single under his own name in 1969, a duet with singer June Conquest called &quot;I Thank You, Baby&quot;. They also recorded the duet &quot;Just Another Reason&quot;, released as the B-side. Former Cleveland Browns president Bill Futterer, who as a college student promoted Curtom in the southeast in 1968 and 1969, was befriended by Hathaway and has cited Hathaway&#x27;s influence on his later projects.

That year, Hathaway signed to Atco Records, then a division of Atlantic Records, after being spotted for the label by producer/musician King Curtis at a trade convention. He released his first single of note, &quot;The Ghetto, Pt. 1&quot;, which he co-wrote with former Howard roommate Leroy Hutson, who became a performer, writer, and producer with Curtom. The track appeared the following year on his critically acclaimed debut LP, &quot;Everything Is Everything&quot;, which he co-produced with Ric Powell while also arranging all the cuts.

His second LP, &quot;Donny Hathaway&quot;, consisted mostly of covers of contemporary pop, soul, and gospel songs. His third album &quot;Roberta Flack &amp; Donny Hathaway&quot; was an album of duets with former Howard University associate and label mate Roberta Flack, for whom he previously sang backup on &quot;Killing Me Softly with His Song&quot; that established him, especially on the pop charts. The album was a critical and commercial success, including the Ralph MacDonald-penned track &quot;Where Is the Love&quot;, which proved to be not only an R&amp;B success, but also scored Top Five on the pop Hot 100. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA on September 5, 1972. The album also included other covers, including versions of Carole King&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;, &quot;Baby I Love You&quot;, originally a hit for Aretha Franklin, and &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Loving Feeling&quot;.

Perhaps Hathaway&#x27;s most influential recording is his 1972 album, &quot;Live&quot;, which has been termed &quot;one of the best live albums ever recorded&quot; by Daryl Easlea of the BBC. The album is on the list of &quot;40 Favourite Live Albums&quot; published by British online music and culture magazine &quot;The Quietus&quot;. It was recorded at two concerts: side one at the Troubadour in Hollywood, and side two at The Bitter End in Greenwich Village, Manhattan.

Hathaway was the co-composer and performer of the Christmas standard, &quot;This Christmas&quot;. The song, released in 1970, has become a holiday staple and is often used in movies, television and advertising. &quot;This Christmas&quot; has been covered by numerous artists across diverse musical genres, including The Whispers, Diana Ross, Aretha Franklin, The Temptations, The Four Tops, Stevie Wonder, Alexander O&#x27;Neal, Christina Aguilera, Chicago, Harry Connick, Jr., Dru Hill, *NSYNC, Gloria Estefan, Boney James, The Cheetah Girls, Chris Brown, Anthony Arnett (&quot;First Baptist Bracktown Christmas Celebration&quot;), Patti LaBelle and Mary J. Blige (&quot;A Mary Christmas&quot;), Seal, Train and CeeLo Green, among other artists.

Hathaway followed this flurry of work with contributions to soundtracks, along with his recording of the theme song to the TV series &quot;Maude&quot;. He composed and conducted music for the 1972 soundtrack of the movie &quot;Come Back Charleston Blue&quot;. In the mid-1970s, he produced albums for other artists including Cold Blood, where he expanded the musical range of lead singer Lydia Pense.

His final studio album, &quot;Extension of a Man&quot; came out in 1973 with two tracks, &quot;Love Love Love&quot; and &quot;I Love You More Than You&#x27;ll Ever Know&quot; reaching both the pop and R&amp;B charts. It also included his classic ballad, &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll All Be Free&quot; and a six-minute symphonic-styled instrumental piece called &quot;I Love The Lord, He Heard My Cry&quot;. He told UK music journalist Nathan, David in 1973, &quot;I always liked pretty music and I&#x27;ve always wanted to write it.&quot; Added the writer, &quot;He declined to give one particular influence or inspiration but said that Ravel, Debussy and Stravinsky were amongst whom he studied.&quot;

He returned to the charts in 1978 after again teaming up with Roberta Flack for a duet, &quot;The Closer I Get to You&quot; on her album, &quot;Blue Lights in the Basement&quot;. The song topped the R&amp;B chart and reached the No. 2 spot on the Hot 100. Atlantic then put out another solo single, &quot;You Were Meant For Me&quot; shortly before his sudden death.

Liner notes for later releases of his final solo album explain: &quot;Donny is no longer here, but the song &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll All Be Free&quot; gathers momentum as part of his legacy... Donny literally sat in the studio and cried when he heard the playback of his final mix. It&#x27;s pretty special when an artist can create something that wipes them out.&quot; Edward Howard, lyricist of the song, adds, &quot;It was a spiritual thing for me... What was going through my mind at the time was Donny, because Donny was a very troubled person. I hoped that at some point he would be released from all that he was going through. There was nothing I could do but write something that might be encouraging for him. He&#x27;s a good leader for young black men&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Family===
In 1967, Hathaway married Eulaulah Vann. The two met while attending Howard University where both were studying music. They had two daughters, Eulaulah Donyll (Lalah) and Kenya Canc&#x27;Libra. Lalah has enjoyed a successful solo career, while Kenya is a session singer and one of the three backing vocalists on the hit TV program &quot;American Idol&quot;. Both daughters are graduates of the Berklee College of Music.

===Mental illness===
During the peak of his career, Hathaway began experiencing severe bouts of depression and exhibiting unusual behavior. In 1971, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia for which he was prescribed various medications. At one point, Hathaway was prescribed fourteen different medications that he was to take twice a day. After Hathaway was diagnosed and began taking medication, his mental state improved. However, Eulaulah Hathaway has said that her father became less than diligent about following his prescription regimen when he began feeling better and often stopped taking his medications altogether. From 1973 to 1977, Hathaway&#x27;s mental instability wreaked havoc on his life and career and required several hospitalizations. The effects of his depression and severe mood swings also drove a wedge in his and Flack&#x27;s friendship; they did not reconcile for several years, and did not release additional music until the successful release of &quot;The Closer I Get To You&quot; in 1978. Flack and Hathaway then resumed studio recording to compose a second album of duets.

==Death==

Sessions for another album of duets were underway in 1979. On January 13, Hathaway began a recording session with producers/musicians Eric Mercury and James Mtume. Each reported that although Hathaway was singing fine, he began behaving irrationally, seeming to be paranoid and delusional. According to Mtume, Hathaway said that white people were trying to kill him and had connected his brain to a machine for the purpose of stealing his music and his voice. Given Hathaway&#x27;s behavior, Mercury said that he decided the recording session could not continue, so he aborted it and all of the musicians went home.

Hours later, Hathaway was found dead on the pavement below the window of his 15th-floor room in New York City&#x27;s Essex House hotel at 160 Central Park South. It was reported that he had jumped from his balcony.
His hotel room door was locked from the inside and the window glass carefully removed. There were no signs of a struggle, leading investigators to rule that Hathaway&#x27;s death was a suicide. Flack was devastated and, spurred by his death, included the few duets they had finished on her next album, &quot;Roberta Flack Featuring Donny Hathaway&quot; (1980). According to Mercury, Hathaway&#x27;s final recording was &quot;You Are My Heaven&quot;, a song Mercury co-wrote with Stevie Wonder.

Hathaway&#x27;s funeral was conducted by the Reverend Jesse Jackson. Later in 1979, the Whispers recorded the tribute &quot;Song for Donny&quot; for their self-titled album. The song reached No. 21 on the R&amp;B chart. That same year, they used that tribute song&#x27;s arrangement to do a cover of Hathaway&#x27;s song &quot;This Christmas&quot;, included on their Christmas album, &quot;Happy Holidays to You&quot;.

==Influence==
According to Allison Keyes from NPR, Hathaway&#x27;s solo recordings are &quot;part of the foundation of American soul music&quot; and have &quot;influenced performers from R&amp;B singers Alicia Keys &amp; Aaliyah to rapper Common to singer-guitarist George Benson&quot;. He was named the 49th-greatest singer of all time in a 2010 list published by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Justin Timberlake called him &quot;the best singer of all time.&quot; Raúl Midón said that Hathaway is &quot;the strongest soul singer that ever existed&quot; and compares his vocal technique to a classical vocalist. &quot;When Donny sings any song, he owns it,&quot; Stevie Wonder was quoted by David Ritz as saying. Amy Winehouse called Hathaway her favorite artist of all time and refers to &quot;Mr Hathaway&quot; in her song Rehab. The Korean indie pop group Hathaw9y named themselves in honor of him. Rock critic Robert Christgau described Hathaway as &quot;a synthesizer of limitless cultural aspiration&quot; who &quot;conveyed a sense of roots&quot; and was never content with &quot;the classbound pop fantasies of Ashford &amp; Simpson&quot;, but mused that &quot;the idealistic credulousness of a project that incorporated pop, jazz, a little blues, lots of gospel, and the conservatory into an all-over black style is linked to the floridity that mars much of his work.&quot;

<text>Front-pointing (or German technique) is a technique used in mountaineering and ice climbing where a climber embeds, usually by a kicking action, the sharp metal &#x27;front-point(s)&#x27; of their modern metal rigid crampon into the ice or hard packed snow to gain a secure foothold to assist their upward momentum on the climbing route.

Front-pointing places greater strain on the leg muscles than the French technique where the feet remain flat on the surface using the &quot;duck foot&quot; (feet pointing either side at 90 degrees), or the &quot;flat foot&quot; (moving diagonally up the slope). For steep slopes of about 45 degrees and upwards, the French technique is less feasible to execute. Some use a hybrid technique, the &quot;pied troisieme&quot; (or the 3 o&#x27;clock position), where one crampon (the lower one) is front-pointing while the other crampon is at a 90-degree sideways angle but still flat on the surface and following the French technique; this hybrid technique allows climbers to avoid the strain of full front-pointing when ascending snow slopes that are both long and steep.

Front-pointing is an easy concept but takes experience to apply efficiently and safely. Ice climbers need to ensure that when kicking the front-points of their crampons into ice they do not shatter the wider surface, which could break off. Novice ice climbers, and particularly those used to rock climbing, tend to raise their heels upward when front-pointing — as rock climbers do on footholds — which can cause the points of the crampon to shear out of the ice; experienced climbers drop their heels slightly. While front-pointing encourages a direct upward climbing style, ice climbers need to maintain a resting &quot;triangle position&quot;, with the feet apart on either side of their centre of gravity (COG), and avoid their feet being together right under their COG.

Front-pointing dates from the early 1930s when Grivel added two front points to their 10-point crampon of the French technique. It came to international prominence when Heinrich Harrer, in his book about the famous 1938 first ascent of the Eiger north face, said &quot;I looked back, down our endless ladder of [French technique] steps. Up it, I saw the New Era coming at express speed; there were two men running — I mean running, not climbing — up&quot;. The two men were Anderl Heckmair and Ludwig Vörg, who were front-pointing on the Eiger&#x27;s second ice field. They joined with Heckmair and Fritz Kasparek to complete the climb. In the 1960s, Stubai bent the second row of points forward for additional &quot;heel-dropping traction&quot; when front-pointing (see image).

<doc id="526577" wikidata="Q4547309" url="?curid=526577" title="111 (emergency telephone number)">
<text>111 (usually pronounced &quot;one-one-one&quot;) is the emergency telephone number in New Zealand. It was first implemented in Masterton and Carterton on 29 September 1958, and was progressively rolled out nationwide with the last exchanges converting in 1988.

About 870,000 111 calls are made every year, and the police introduced a new number (105) in 2019, to take non-urgent police calls away from the &quot;111&quot; service (see 105 (telephone number)).

==History==

===Introduction===
Before the introduction of 111, access to emergency services was complicated. For the quarter of New Zealand’s then 414,000 telephone subscribers still on manual telephone exchange, one would simply pick up the telephone and ask the answering operator for the police, ambulance, or fire service by name. However, the problem on manual exchanges was that calls were answered first-come-first-served, which meant on busy exchanges, emergency calls could be delayed. For automatic exchanges, one would need to know the local police, ambulance or fire service’s telephone number, or look it up in the telephone directory, or dial the toll operator and ask them to place the call. The problem was that the numbers were different for each exchange, and again, there was no way to tell emergency calls apart from regular calls. Auckland, for example, had 40 telephone exchanges, and the telephone directory had 500 pages to search through to find the right number, although the separate emergency numbers for fire, police and ambulance in the main service area (e.g. Auckland, but not for not minor exchanges) were listed in bold on the first page.

Following the 1947 Ballantynes fire in Christchurch, fire officer Arthur Varley was recruited from the UK to bring about a reform of the fire service. Familiar with Britain’s 999 system, he campaigned for the setting up of a universal emergency telephone number across the country. In mid-1957, a committee was set up to institute a common emergency number across New Zealand, consisting of the Post and Telegraph Department, the Police, the Health Department, and the Fire Service. In early 1958, the Postmaster General approved the provision of the service using the number 111. 
111 was specifically chosen to be similar to Britain&#x27;s 999 service. With pulse dialling, New Zealand telephones pulse in reverse to the UK - dialling 0 sent ten pulses, 1 sent nine, 2 sent eight, 3 sent seven, etc. in New Zealand, while in the UK, dialling 1 sent one pulse, 2 sent two, etc. In the early years of 111, exchanges primarily used British-built step-by-step equipment, except for this unusual orientation. Therefore, dialling 111 on a New Zealand telephone sent three sets of nine pulses to the exchange, exactly the same as the UK&#x27;s 999. Number &quot;9&quot; in New Zealand (or &quot;1&quot; in Britain) was not used for the first digit of telephone numbers because of the likelihood of accidental false calls from open-wire lines tapping together, etc.

The telephone exchange in Masterton was replaced in 1956, and was the first exchange to have the technology installed for the 111 service. Hence, Masterton and nearby Carterton were the first towns in the country to get the new service.

The 111 service began on 29 September 1958 in the two towns. When a subscriber dialled 111 at either exchange, the call was routed by the automatic exchange onto one of three dedicated lines to the toll switchboard at the Masterton exchange (although the exchange connected calls automatically, long-distance (toll) calls still had to be connected manually through an operator). A red light glowed on the switchboard panel, and another red light would glow on top of the switchboard. Two hooters also sounded, one in the exchange and the other in the building passage. The first operator to plug into the line took the call, and a supervisor would plug into the line to help if the situation became difficult.

Dedicated lines connected the toll switchboard to the Masterton police station, fire brigade, and the hospital, where they were connected to a special red telephone. The line connected to the fire station, when it rang, also sounded the station alarm bells. A similar arrangement was employed at the police station, while at the hospital the call went to the local switchboard where it was identified by a red light and a distinctive bell.

Among the first 111 calls was a call for an ambulance after an accident at a sawmill, and call to the fire service after a rubbish tip fire in Carterton. The first hoax call also occurred on the first day – a caller dialled 111 to ask for the address of a Carterton hotel.

===Expansion===
After the introduction of 111 in Masterton and Carterton, the service soon expanded to most major towns and cities.

The service was introduced in Wellington in April 1961, where the multi-exchange area included some pre-war Rotary exchanges.

Christchurch introduced 111 from 11pm on 28 August 1964. The introduction coincided with cutting in new exchanges at Linwood and Hillmorton and the introduction of six-figure telephone numbers for most suburban exchanges.

By the mid-1980s all but a few rural exchanges had the service, and by 1988, 111 was available on every exchange in mainland New Zealand.

The dates of installation in major towns and cities were:

===Controversy===
In New Zealand in 2004, the police answering of emergency telephone service came under sustained scrutiny for systemic problems.

A case that caused particular concern was the disappearance of Iraena Asher, who vanished in October 2004 after she rang the police in distress and was instead sent a taxi that went to the wrong address.

On 11 May 2005 a severely critical independent report into the Police Communications Centres was released. It expressed ongoing concerns for public safety, and identified inadequate management, poor leadership, inadequate training, understaffing, underutilised technology and a lack of customer focus as being underlying risks for systemic failures. The report made over 60 recommendations for improvement, including recommending a 15 to 20 year strategy to move away from using 111 as an emergency telephone number because of problems with misdialling due to the repeated digits.

Despite ambiguous reporting, these issues were never with the 111 service itself, and did not impact fire or ambulance services. The problems were restricted solely to the Police Communications Centres.&#x27;

In February 2024, documents from the New Zealand Police showed that the 111 service was outdated and was causing deaths and injuries. For example, a woman was stabbed to death by her partner after she was overheard calling 111, it is believed, if she was able to use another method to contact 111 such as texting, there is a possibility her death could have been prevented. Furthermore, a man drowned at a beach with only ambulance staff being alerted despite both police and surf and rescue being on the beach at the time, neither emergency service was made aware of the event due to the outdated system and therefore unfortunately neither responded. A police spokesperson said, “The public may not receive timely help when they need it, and frontline responders could find themselves attending dangerous incidents without pertinent situational information and without adequate support.” Even with the emergency system failing 59 times in just 2021 and 2022 alone, the New Zealand Government refused to pay the $60 million [NZD] to replace the aging system. Despite both Police and Fire and Emergency making pleas that there was an urgent need to replace the vital system. 

=== 2024–present ===
In 2024 the Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey proposed adding a mental health option to 111.

==Contacting 111==

Mobile networks will treat a 111 call as the highest priority, disconnecting another call if necessary to allow it to go through. If the mobile network your phone is connected to has limited or no coverage where you&#x27;re calling from, an attempt will automatically be made to access another mobile network to ensure the call is connected. All 111 calls are free of charge under every circumstance unless it is a non-genuine call made from a landline.

Upon dialling 111, the caller will first hear a recorded message: &quot;You have dialed 111 emergency; your call is being connected.&quot; This message was added in 2008 to allow people who have accidentally dialled 111 to hang up straight away. The Spark 111 emergency operator will then answer: &quot;This is the 111 operator, do you need the fire, the ambulance, or the police?&quot;. The operator will then connect the caller to the required service: &quot;I&#x27;m connecting you to the &quot;[service]&quot; now, please stay on the line with me.&quot; The Spark 111 emergency operator will remain connected with the caller until the specific service&#x27;s communications centre has answered, and two way communication has been confirmed.

Emergency calls for some other services also use 111, but are still connected to one of the three services. For example, search and rescue or civil defence emergencies are connected to the New Zealand Police. Gas leaks and hazardous substance emergencies are connected to Fire and Emergency New Zealand.

In the interest of international compatibility, calls to foreign emergency numbers (112, 911, 999, 000 etc.), will be automatically diverted to 111. On average, 48% of calls to 111 are non-genuine, despite this police say they do not want to discourage people from call 111 if they are in genuine need of emergency services. Over time, several measures have been introduced to attempt to reduce the number of non-genuine calls, such as the recorded message played to callers as soon as they dial 111 and charging for non-genuine calls made from landlines.

In May 2017, New Zealand introduced the Emergency Caller Location Information (ECLI) Service for providing the location of 111 mobile callers. ECLI has two sources of location:

# Advanced Mobile Location (both Google&#x27;s Android Emergency Location Service, and since March 2018 Apple&#x27;s AML for iOS); and
# Network based location to provide a mobile callers probable location using statistical analysis to derive the callers probable location based on the cell tower connecting the emergency call (this is not triangulation as triangulation requires multiple cell towers which is not the norm for rural areas) with an accuracy of 1+ kilometer;

Depending on a number of environmental conditions the location provided can be as precise as 4 meters using the GNSS capabilities of a smartphone. All location data is only to be held for 60 minutes and is then deleted to comply with the regulated conditions of use of ECLI as set by the NZ Privacy Commissioner.

== 111 contact code ==
The 111 Contact Code is a code made to make sure that people are able to call 111 with a landline during a power cut. It was written by the Commerce Commission, was finalised in November 2020, and came into effect in February 2021. The contact code was required to be created by 1 January 2022 under the Telecommunications (New Regulatory Framework) Amendment Act. It was created due to a shift towards fibre and wireless communications which require power sources. The code requires that telecommunications service providers tell their customers at least once a year that they can not call 111 during a power cut. If customers are not able to use their call emergency services during a power cut, for example if they can not use a mobile phone, then the service provider must provide a device that allows customers to call for at least eight hours during a power outage.

In April 2024 the Commerce Commission brought One NZ to the High Court for allegedly breaching the code.

==Other New Zealand emergency and related numbers==
Other than 111, the following national emergency and related numbers are used for different services:-
*105: police single non-emergency number; introduced in 2019 for non-emergency calls to the police.
**555: traffic incidents (dialable from mobile phones only)
*0508-82-88-65: non-emergency Suicide Crisis Helpline (111 is used for immediate danger)
*0800-16-16-10: deaf emergency fax (connects to police)
*0800-16-16-16: deaf emergency textphone/TTY (connects to police)
*0800-76-47-66: poisons and hazardous chemicals emergency
*0800-61-11-16: non-emergency medical advice (&quot;Healthline&quot;, run by Ministry of Health)
*0800-808-400: railway emergencies (KiwiRail Network)
*0800-50-11-22: Military Police (NZDF Military Police)

Other emergency numbers vary from area to area, or from service provider to service provider. These numbers can be found under the &quot;Emergency Information&quot; section on pages 2 and 3 of the local White Pages telephone directory.

==International usage of 111==
* In South Korea, 111 is a special telephone number for accessing National Intelligence Service to report crimes that threaten national security.
* In England, Wales and Scotland, 111 is a non-emergency medical helpline provided by the National Health Service.
* In Vietnam, 111 is a child protection hotline.

<doc id="526578" wikidata="Q970490" url="?curid=526578" title="François-Timoléon de Choisy">
<text>François Timoléon, abbé de Choisy (; 16 August 1644 – 2 October 1724) was a French cross-dresser, abbé, and author. He wrote numerous works on church history as well as travelogues, memoirs and fiction.

==Biography==
De Choisy was born in Paris. His father was attached to the household of the Duke of Orléans whilst his mother, who was on intimate terms with Anne of Austria, was regularly called upon to amuse Louis XIV. At his mother’s whim, the boy was dressed like a girl until he was eighteen, and, after appearing for a short time in male clothing, resumed woman&#x27;s dress on the (perhaps ironic) advice of Madame de La Fayette. Upon his mother&#x27;s death, he inherited a large sum of money, allowing him to live a life of leisure. De Choisy delighted in the most extravagant toilettes until being publicly rebuked by the duc de Montausier, causing his retirement for some time to the provinces; thereupon, he allegedly used female appearance to serve numerous intrigues. However, doubt has been cast upon the veracity of these allegations, with historian Paul Scott of the University of Kansas stating &quot;if you regard it [the memoir] with any scrutiny, there are implausibilities, contradictions, anachronisms and no contemporary corroboration whatsoever.&quot;

De Choisy was made an abbé in his childhood, and poverty, induced by extravagance, drove him to live on his benefice at Sainte-Seine in Burgundy, where a kindred spirit was found amongst his neighbours in Bussy-Rabutin. De Choisy visited Rome in the retinue of the cardinal de Bouillon in 1676, and shortly afterwards a serious illness brought about a sudden conversion to genuine religion.

In 1685, he accompanied the Chevalier de Chaumont on a mission to Siam. He was ordained a priest, and received various ecclesiastical preferments, such as the priory of Saint-Benoît-du-Sault in 1689. He was admitted to the Académie française on 24 July 1687.

==Works==
De Choisy wrote a number of historical and religious works, of which the most notable are the following:
*&quot;Quatre dialogues sur l&#x27;immortalité de l&#x27;âme ...&quot; (1684), written with the Abbé Dangeau and explaining their conversion.
*&quot;Histoire de l&#x27;Eglise&quot; (11 vols., 1703–1723)
De Choisy is remembered for his gossiping &quot;&quot; (1727), which contains detailed portraits of his contemporaries, although there is some question about its historical accuracy.

The &quot;Mémoires&quot; passed through many editions, and were edited in 1868 by M. de Lescure. Some admirable letters of de Choisy are included in the correspondence of Bussy-Rabutin. De Choisy is said to have burnt some of their indiscreet revelations, but left a considerable quantity of unpublished manuscripts. Part of this material was surreptitiously used in an anonymous &quot;Histoire de madame la comtesse de Barres&quot; (Antwerp, 1735) and again with much editing in the &quot;Vie de M. l&#x27;abbé de Choisy&quot; (Lausanne and Geneva, 1742), ascribed by Paul Lacroix to Lenglet Dufresnoy; the text was finally edited (1870) by Lacroix as &quot;Aventures de l&#x27;abbé de Choisy&quot;. See also Sainte-Beuve, &quot;Causeries du lundi&quot;, vol. iii.

==Influences==
The Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711–1776) had de Choisy&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires&quot; and account of Siam in his library.

<text>Rostanga is a genus of sea slugs in the family Discodorididae. Some sources, such as &quot;The Sea Slug Forum&quot; still classify &quot;Rostanga&quot; in the family Dorididae.

==Phylogeny==
A phylogenetic analysis shows that the species &quot;Rostanga aureamala&quot;, &quot;Rostanga elandsia&quot;, &quot;Rostanga pepha&quot; and &quot;Rostanga setidens&quot; form a sister group with the other species in this genus. The species from Japan and the Marshall Islands form the basal clade. The species from the tropical Indo-Pacific are not monophyletic. The species from the Atlantic Ocean and the Eastern Pacific from a clade that is a sister group to &quot;R. australis&quot;. The Indo-Pacific species &quot;Rostanga bifurcata&quot; forms a sister group to &quot;Rostanga dentacus&quot;.

==Species==
Species within the genus &quot;Rostanga&quot; include:

;Species brought into synonymy:
* &quot;Rostanga australis&quot; Rudman &amp; Avern, 1989: synonym of &quot;Rostanga crawfordi&quot; (Burn, 1969)
* &quot;Rostanga evansi&quot; Eliot, 1906 : synonym of &quot;Jorunna evansi&quot; (Eliot, 1906)
* &quot;Rostanga hartleyi&quot; Burn, 1958 : synonym of &quot;Jorunna hartleyi&quot; (Burn, 1958)

<text>The Pomeranian culture, also Pomeranian or Pomerelian Face Urn culture was an Iron Age culture with origins in parts of the area south of the Baltic Sea (which later became Pomerania, part of northern Germany/Poland), from the 7th century BC to the 3rd century BC, which eventually covered most of today&#x27;s Poland.

About 650 BC, it evolved from the Lusatian culture between the lower Vistula and Parseta rivers, and subsequently expanded southward. Between 200 and 150 BC, it was succeeded by the Oksywie culture in eastern Pomerania and the Przeworsk culture at the upper Vistula and Oder rivers.

==Features==
The Pomeranian culture developed in Western Pomerania covering the entire range of the Oder (Odra) and Vistula river basins. It has been sometimes associated with the Bastarnae. The original homeland of the Bastarnae remains uncertain. Babeş and Shchukin argue in favour of an origin in eastern Pomerania on the Baltic coast of northwestern Poland, on the grounds of correspondences in archaeological material e.g. a Pomeranian-style fibula found in a Poieneşti site in Moldavia.

The most characteristic feature was the use of burial urns with faces. The urns were often contained in stone cists. The face-urns have lids in the form of hats, often miniature ear-rings of real bronze are added. The faces are sometimes modelled very naturalistically, and no two urns show the same face. Incised drawings on the urns show hunting scenes, chariot races, or riders. Brooches of Certoza-type and necklaces of multiple bronze rings are typical examples of metal work.

The economy was similar to that of the Lusatian culture. Rye was systematically cultivated for the first time, but still formed a minor component of the cereals. There were fewer hill forts than in the area of the Lusatian culture further west. Southern imports were sparse as well.

==Related cultures==

A related culture of the same age was the House Urn culture in central Germany.

==Spread==

In the later Iron Age, the Pomeranian culture spread southward, into areas formerly belonging to the Lusatian, Wysoko- and Milograd cultures. In Masovia and Poland, this mixture led to the development of the group with bell-shaped burials.

<text>Colored (or coloured) is a racial descriptor historically used in the United States during the Jim Crow era to refer to an African American. In many places, it may be considered a slur. It has taken on a different meaning in Southern Africa referring to a person of mixed or Cape Coloured heritage.

==Dictionary definitions==
The word &quot;colored&quot; (Middle English &quot;icoloured&quot;) was first used in the 14th century but with a meaning other than race or ethnicity. The earliest uses of the term to denote a member of dark-skinned groups of peoples occurred in the second part of the 18th century in reference to South America. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, &quot;colored&quot; was first used in this context in 1758 to translate the Spanish term (&#x27;colored women&#x27;, literally &#x27;women of color&#x27;) in Antonio de Ulloa&#x27;s &quot;A voyage to South America&quot;.

The term came in use in the United States during the early 19th century, and it then was adopted by emancipated slaves as a term of racial pride after the end of the American Civil War until it was replaced as a self-designation by &quot;Black&quot; or &quot;African-American&quot; during the second part of the 20th century. Due to its use in the Jim Crow era to designate items or places restricted to African Americans, the word &quot;colored&quot; is now usually considered to be offensive.

The term has historically had multiple connotations. In British usage, the term refers to &quot;a person who is wholly or partly of non-white descent,&quot; and its use is generally regarded as antiquated or offensive. Other terms are preferable, particularly when referring to a single ethnicity.

==United States==

In the United States, &quot;colored&quot; was the predominant and preferred term for African Americans in the mid- to late nineteenth century in part because it was accepted by both white and black Americans as more inclusive, covering those of mixed-race ancestry (and, less commonly, Asian Americans and other racial minorities), as well as those who were considered to have &quot;complete Black ancestry&quot;. They did not think of themselves as or accept the label &quot;African&quot;, did not want whites pressuring them to relocate to a colony in Africa, and said they were no more African than white Americans were European. In place of &quot;African&quot; they preferred the term &quot;colored&quot;, or the more learned and precise &quot;Negro&quot;. However, the term &quot;Negro&quot; later fell from favor following the Civil Rights Movement as it was seen as imposed upon the community it described by white people during slavery, and carried connotations of subservience. The term &quot;black&quot; was preferred during the 1960s by the Black Power movement, as well as radical black nationalists (the Black Muslims and the Black Panthers), pan-Africanists (Stokely Carmichael, leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) and political progressives. &quot;Negro&quot; was still favored as self-descriptive racial term over &quot;black&quot; by a plurality in the late 1960s; however, by the late 1970s and early 1980s, &quot;black&quot; was strongly favored.

NPR reported that the &quot;use of the phrase &#x27;colored people&#x27; peaked in books published in 1970.&quot; However, some individuals have more recently called for a revival of &quot;African American&quot;, or &quot;Afro-American&quot;, so as to remove attention to skin color. &quot;Colored people lived in three neighborhoods that were clearly demarcated, as if by ropes or turnstiles&quot;, wrote Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. about growing up in segregated West Virginia in the 1960s. &quot;Welcome to the Colored Zone, a large stretched banner could have said ... Of course, the colored world was not so much a neighborhood as a condition of existence.&quot; &quot;For most of my childhood, we couldn&#x27;t eat in restaurants or sleep in hotels, we couldn&#x27;t use certain bathrooms or try on clothes in stores&quot;, recalls Gates. His mother retaliated by not buying clothes that she was not allowed to try on. He remembered hearing a white man deliberately calling his father by the wrong name: &quot;&#x27;He knows my name, boy,&#x27; my father said after a long pause. &#x27;He calls all colored people George.&#x27;&quot; When Gates&#x27;s cousin became the first black cheerleader at the local high school, she was not allowed to sit with the team and drink Coke from a glass, but had to stand at the counter drinking from a paper cup. Gates also wrote about his experiences in his 1995 book, &quot;Colored People: A Memoir&quot;.

===Census terms in the United States===
In 1851, an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to the &quot;colored population&quot;. In 1863, the War Department established the Bureau of Colored Troops.

The first 12 United States Census counts counted &quot;colored&quot; people, who totaled nine million in 1900. The censuses of 1910–1960 counted &quot;negroes&quot;. 

===Term in NAACP===
The term is still used in the name of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, although it is generally referred to as the NAACP. In 2008, its communications director Carla Sims said &quot;the term &#x27;colored&#x27; is not derogatory, [the NAACP] chose the word &#x27;colored&#x27; because it was the most positive description commonly used [in 1909, when the association was founded]. It&#x27;s outdated and antiquated but not offensive.&quot; However, NAACP today rarely uses its full name and made this decision not long after the United Negro College Fund switched to using just UNCF or United Fund.

==Southern Africa==
In South Africa and neighboring countries, the term &quot;Coloureds&quot; refers to a multiracial ethnic group native to Southern Africa who have ancestry from more than one of the populations inhabiting the region, including indigenous (Khoisan, Bantu and others), Whites (including Afrikaners), Austronesian, East Asian, or South Asian (also called Cape Malays; it was once a subcategory of the Apartheid Coloured racial grouping). Under Apartheid, South Africa broadly classified its population into four races, namely Blacks, Whites, Coloureds and Indians.

She is a Member (MLC) of Bihar Legislative Council and currently serving as the leader of the opposition in Bihar Legislative Council.

She is married to Indian politician Lalu Prasad, former chief minister of Bihar (1990–1997). Yadav previously served as a member of Bihar Legislative Assembly (MLA) and she formerly served as the leader of the opposition in Bihar Legislative Assembly.

==Early life and education==
Rabri was born in 1959 in Salar Kalan village, located near Mirganj in the Gopalganj district of Bihar. However, she has stated in affidavits submitted for elections that her birth year is as early as 1953. Her parents are Sib Prasad Chaudhary and Maharjia Devi. She is named after an Indian sweet as per a custom in her family. Her 3 sisters are similarly named Jalebi, Rasgulla and Paan.

She has studied only up to the fifth standard at a local school in her village. Her parents were hesitant to send their daughters to schools located far away, unlike her brothers, who received proper education. As a result, none of her sisters is educated. Prabhunath Yadav, Subhash Prasad Yadav and Sadhu Yadav are her three real brothers.

==Political career==
Rabri Devi became the first female Chief Minister of Bihar on 25 July 1997, after her husband, Lalu Prasad, was forced to resign following the arrest warrant issued against him in corruption charges relating to the Fodder scam (&#x27;&quot;Chaara Ghotala&quot;&#x27;, as known locally).

Devi was elected thrice to Bihar Vidhan Sabha from Raghopur seat. In 2010 Bihar Legislative Assembly election, Devi contested from two seats: Raghopur and Sonpur assembly seats, but lost both in an election where the Rashtriya Janata Dal faced defeat, winning only 22 seats.

She contested from Saran in 2014 Lok Sabha election but lost to Rajiv Pratap Rudy of BJP.

Rabri Devi was elected unopposed to the Legislative Council.

<doc id="526588" wikidata="Q274250" url="?curid=526588" title="Louise de La Fayette">
<text>Louise Angélique Motier de la Fayette (8 November 1618 – 11 January 1665) was a French courtier and close friend and confidante of King Louis XIII. She later left the court and entered a convent. She was known for her influence upon the monarch both before and after she left the court.

== Life ==

Louise was one of the fourteen children of Jean comte de La Fayette, and Marguerite de Bourbon-Busset. She was born in Amathay-Vésigneux. Her mother was a member of House Bourbon-Busset an illegitimate branch of the royal House of Bourbon. Her sister-in-law was Madame de La Fayette (1634–1693) the author of &quot;La Princesse de Clèves&quot;, France&#x27;s first historical novel and one of the earliest novels in literature.

=== Life in the royal court ===
Through her grandmother, Louise de Bourbon-Busset, she came to the French court to Paris, and became maid-of-honor to Anne of Austria. In 1635 Cardinal Richelieu sought to attract the attention of Louis XIII to her in the hope that she might counterbalance the influence exercised over him by Marie de Hautefort.

However, &quot;[t]he hedonism and promiscuity of many courtiers repelled [Louis XIII] and attempts to provide him with a mistress failed lamentably.&quot;
The affair did not turn out as the minister wished. The King was attracted to Louise because of her &quot;innocence and purity&quot;, and he did indeed make her the &quot;confidante&quot; of his affairs. But when he divulged to her his resentment for the Cardinal, she, far from repeating Louis&#x27;s confidences to the minister, set herself to encourage the King in his resistance to Richelieu&#x27;s dominion.
She refused, nevertheless, to become Louis&#x27;s mistress, and after taking leave of the King in Anne of Austria&#x27;s presence, retired to the convent of the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary in 1637.

===Nun===
As a Visitandine nun she was repeatedly visited by Louis, with whom she maintained a correspondence. Richelieu intercepted the letters, and by omissions and falsifications succeeded in destroying their mutual confidence. The cessation of their intercourse was regretted by the queen, who had been reconciled with her husband through the influence of Louise. At the time of her death in January 1665, Mlle de La Fayette was superior of a convent of her order which she had founded in 1651 with Henrietta Maria widow of Charles I of England at Chaillot.

<doc id="526590" wikidata="Q2011347" url="?curid=526590" title="Leyden cheese">
<text>Leyden, from , is a semi-hard, cumin and caraway seed flavoured cheese made in the Netherlands from cow&#x27;s milk. It is made both in factories and on farms, historically in the Leiden area.

 is the most common type of &quot;komijnekaas&quot;—cheese that includes cumin as an ingredient—in the Netherlands. The cheese is round and flat like Gouda cheese; however, it is made with sharp edges on one side and less roundness to its side. It has a fat percentage of 30% to 40%, and can weigh between and .

==Production==
On the farms, about 5% of buttermilk may be added to the milk, and it is set with rennet at a temperature of to . About 30 minutes later, the curd is cut with a harp, stirred, and warmed to about by pouring in hot whey. The curd is dipped with a cloth and kneaded. Cumin seeds are added to a portion of the curd, and the curd is then put into cloth-lined hoops in three layers, with the spiced curd as the middle layer. The cheese is pressed for about three hours, then it is redressed, inverted, and again pressed overnight. It may be salted with dry salt, or it may be immersed in a brine bath. It is cured in a cool, moist cellar. If the rind becomes too hard, it is washed with whey or salty water.

==Origin==
Traditionally, the farms in the Netherlands produced butter for the local markets. Butter had to be produced locally as it spoiled quickly. This resulted in a byproduct of semi-skimmed (part skim) milk, which was usually fed to calves, as it was of limited value. Another way to use the milk was to produce low-fat cheese. Low-fat cheeses could be preserved better than full-cream cheese (such as Gouda), especially at higher temperatures. Farmers in the area near Leiden added cumin seeds and used to colour their cheeses using annatto, which gives the cheese its red color.

Traditional farm-made &quot;&quot; made in the west of the Netherlands is an EU and UK Protected Designation of Origin named . The addition (&#x27;with keys&#x27;) stems from the city of Leiden&#x27;s coat of arms, which bears a set of keys.

A typical analysis of the cheese is: moisture 40.6%, fat 13.5% and protein, 37.3%.

<doc id="526594" wikidata="Q2072081" url="?curid=526594" title="Person of color">
<text>The term &quot;person of color&quot; (: people of color or persons of color; abbreviated POC) is primarily used to describe any person who is not considered &quot;white&quot;. In its current meaning, the term originated in, and is primarily associated with, the United States; however, since the 2010s, it has been adopted elsewhere in the Anglosphere (often as person of colour), including relatively limited usage in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, South Africa, and Singapore.

In the United States, the term is involved in the various definitions of non-whiteness, including African Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, Pacific Islander Americans, multiracial Americans, and some Latino Americans, though members of these communities may prefer to view themselves through their cultural identities rather than color-related terminology. The term, as used in the United States, emphasizes common experiences of systemic racism, which some communities have faced. The term may also be used with other collective categories of people such as &quot;communities of color&quot;, &quot;men of color&quot; (MOC), &quot;women of color&quot; (WOC), or &quot;librarians of color&quot;. The acronym &quot;BIPOC&quot; refers to &quot;black, indigenous, and other people of color&quot; and aims to emphasize the historic oppression of black and indigenous people. The term &quot;colored&quot; was originally equivalent in use to the term &quot;person of color&quot; in American English, but usage of the appellation &quot;colored&quot; in the Southern United States gradually came to be restricted to &quot;Negroes&quot;, and is now considered a racial pejorative. Elsewhere in the world, and in other dialects of English, the term may have entirely different connotations, however; for example, in South Africa, &quot;Coloureds&quot; refers to multiple multiracial ethnic groups and is sometimes applied to other groups in Southern Africa, such as the of Namibia.

==History==
The &quot;American Heritage Guide to Contemporary Usage and Style&quot; cites usage of &quot;people of colour&quot; as far back as 1796. It was initially used to refer to light-skinned people of mixed African and European heritage. French colonists used the term &quot;gens de couleur&quot; (&quot;people of color&quot;) to refer to people of mixed African and European ancestry who were freed from slavery in the Americas. In South Carolina and other parts of the Deep South, this term was used to distinguish between slaves who were mostly &quot;black&quot; or &quot;Negro&quot; and free people who were primarily &quot;mulatto&quot; or &quot;mixed race&quot;. After the American Civil War, &quot;colored&quot; was used as a label almost exclusively for black Americans, but the term eventually fell out of favor by the mid-20th century.

Although American activist Martin Luther King Jr. used the term &quot;citizens of color&quot; in 1963, the phrase in its current meaning did not catch on until the late 1970s. In the late 20th century, the term &quot;person of color&quot; was introduced in the United States in order to counter the condescension implied by the terms &quot;non-white&quot; and &quot;minority&quot;, and racial justice activists in the U.S., influenced by radical theorists such as Frantz Fanon, popularized it at this time. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was in wide circulation. Both anti-racist activists and academics sought to move the understanding of race beyond the black–white dichotomy then prevalent.

The phrase &quot;women of color&quot; was developed and introduced for wide use by a group of black women activists at the National Women&#x27;s Conference in 1977. The phrase was used as a method of communicating solidarity between non-white women that was, according to Loretta Ross, not based on &quot;biological destiny&quot; but instead a political act of naming themselves.

In the twenty-first century, use of the term and the categorization continued to proliferate: for example, the Joint Council of Librarians of Color (JCLC), a recurring conference of the American Library Association, which uses the &quot;of color&quot; designation for its five ethnic affiliate associations. They include: the Black Caucus of the American Library Association, the American Indian Library Association, the Asian Pacific American Librarians Association, the Chinese American Librarians Association, and REFORMA: The National Association to Promote Library &amp; Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish Speaking.

==Political significance==
According to Stephen Satris of Clemson University, in the United States there are two main racial divides. The first is the &quot;black–white&quot; delineation; the second racial delineation is the one &quot;between whites and everyone else&quot;, with whites being &quot;narrowly construed&quot; and everyone else being called &quot;people of color&quot;. Because the term &quot;people of color&quot; includes vastly different people with only the common distinction of not being white, it draws attention to the perceived fundamental role of racialization in the United States. Joseph Tuman of San Francisco State University argues that the term &quot;people of color&quot; is attractive because it unites disparate racial and ethnic groups into a larger collective in solidarity with one another.

Use of the term &quot;person of color&quot;, especially in the United States, is often associated with the social justice movement. Style guides from the American Heritage Guide to Contemporary Usage and Style, the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and Mount Holyoke College all recommend the term &quot;person of color&quot; over other alternatives. Unlike &quot;colored&quot;, which historically referred primarily to black people and is often considered , &quot;person of color&quot; and its variants refer inclusively to all non-European peoples—often with the notion that there is political solidarity among them—and, according to one style guide, &quot;are virtually always considered terms of pride and respect&quot;.

==Criticism==
Many critics of the term, both white and non-white, object to its lack of specificity and find the phrase racially offensive. It has been argued that the term lessens the focus on individual issues facing different racial and ethnic groups, particularly African Americans. Preserving &quot;whiteness&quot; as an intact category while lumping every other racial group into an indiscriminate category (&quot;of color&quot;) replicates the marginalization that the term was intended to counter. Other commentators state that the term &quot;people of color&quot; is a misnomer and an arbitrary term in which people who are white are mislabeled as people of color. People of color also encompasses various heterogeneous groups which have little in common, with some arguing that American culture as a whole does not deliberate on economic inequality or issues of class.

Political scientist Angelo Falcón argues that the use of broad terms like &quot;person of color&quot; is offensive because it aggregates diverse communities and projects &quot;a false unity&quot; that &quot;obscure[s] the needs of Latinos and Asians&quot;. Citing the sensitivity of the issue, Falcón suggested that there should be &quot;a national summit of Black, Latino and Asian community leaders&quot; to discuss &quot;how can the problem of the so-called &#x27;black/white binary&#x27; be tackled in the way it respects the diversity it ignores and helps build the broader constituency for racial social justice that is needed in the country&quot; and to &quot;open the way for a perhaps much-needed resetting of relations between these historically-discriminated against communities that can lead to a more useful etymology of this relationship&quot;.

Comedian George Carlin described &quot;people of color&quot; as &quot;an awkward, bullshit, liberal-guilt phrase that obscures meaning rather than enhancing it&quot;, adding, &quot;What should we call white people? &#x27;People of no color&#x27;?&quot;

The use of the phrase &quot;person of color&quot; to describe white Hispanic and Latino Americans and Spaniards has been criticized as inaccurate. The United States census denotes the term &quot;Latino&quot; as a pan-ethnic label, rather than a racial category, and although many Latinos may qualify as being &quot;people of color&quot;, the indiscriminate labeling of all Latinos as &quot;people of color&quot; obscures the racial diversity that exists within the Latino population itself, and for this reason, some commentators have found the term misleading. 

===BIPOC===
The acronym BIPOC, referring to &quot;black, indigenous, (and) people of color&quot;, first appeared around 2013. By June 2020, it was, according to Sandra Garcia of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;ubiquitous in some corners of Twitter and Instagram&quot;, as racial justice awareness grew in the United States in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. The term aims to emphasize the historic oppression of black and indigenous people, which is argued to be superlative and distinctive in U.S. history at the collective level. The BIPOC Project promotes the term in order &quot;to highlight the unique relationship to whiteness that Indigenous and Black (African Americans) people have, which shapes the experiences of and relationship to white supremacy for all people of color within a U.S. context&quot;.

The term &quot;BIPOC&quot; does not appear to have originated in the Black and Indigenous American communities, as it had been adopted much more widely among white Democrats than among people of color in a 2021 national poll. Asian and Latino Americans have often been confused as to whether the term includes them. The centering of Black and Indigenous people in the acronym has been criticized as an unnecessary, unfounded, and divisive ranking of the oppression faced by the communities of color. The acronym&#x27;s purposeful and definitional assertion that the historical and present-day suffering experienced by Black and Indigenous people is more significant in kind or degree than that of other non-white groups has been described as casting communities of color in an oppression Olympics that obscures intersectional characteristics, similarities, and opportunities for solidarity in the struggle against racism. Critics argue that the systems of oppression foundational to U.S. history were not limited to the slavery and genocide suffered by Black and Indigenous Americans, but also included the Asian American and Latino American experiences of oppression under the Chinese Exclusion Act and the doctrine of manifest destiny. Noting that &quot;Black and Indigenous people are not at the center of every contemporary racial issue&quot;, other commentators have found it problematic that the ascendancy of the term coincided with the pronounced rise in anti-Asian hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic. By rendering Asian Americans as an unnamed &quot;remnant&quot;, critics argue that the acronym renders the racial discrimination they experience invisible, thereby perpetuating harmful model minority and perpetual foreigner stereotypes. Some critics advocate a return to &quot;POC&quot; for its emphasis on coalition-building, while others call for a contextual approach that names &quot;the groups actually included and centered in the arguments themselves&quot;. The term has also been criticized for being redundant.

<text>San Jiao (&quot;triple burner&quot;, or &quot;triple energizer&quot;, or &quot;triple heater&quot;) is a concept in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and acupuncture. It is the sixth organ of Fu, which is the hollow space inside the trunk of the body. In TCM, there are five solid organs and each solid organ has its counterpart in a hollow organ. For instance, the heart is considered a solid organ, and the small intestine its hollow counterpart, or Fu organ. San Jiao is believed to be a body cavity of some kind which has the ability to influence other organs, and overall health, mainly through the free movement of Qi, the fundamental energy or life force on the microcosm and on the macrocosm it is associated with the interactions between The Heavens, humans and earth.

San Jiao means &quot;triple burner&quot;. The upper burner relates to organs the Heart, lungs in the thorax and the breathing function therefore relates to Heaven. The middle burner relates to the organs top of the stomach, the spleen, liver and the digesting function, therefore belongs to Human. The lower burner relates to the organs below the abdomen, Kidneys, Bladder and the urogenital functions, therefore belongs to Earth. If the triple burner function well, then the organs are in harmony. According to traditional Chinese medicine, the triple burner is essential in transporting fluids throughout the body, removing itching and heat, treating swellings, and overcoming problems with various organs.

<doc id="526599" wikidata="Q757386" url="?curid=526599" title="Pain of Salvation">
<text>Pain of Salvation is a Swedish progressive metal band led by Daniel Gildenlöw, who is the band&#x27;s main songwriter, lyricist, guitarist, and vocalist. Pain of Salvation&#x27;s sound is characterised by riff-oriented guitar work, a broad vocal range, oscillation between heavy and calm passages, complex vocal harmonies and the structures of their albums, syncopation, and polyrhythms. Thus far, every album released by the band has been a concept album. Lyrically, the band tends to address contemporary issues, such as sexuality, war, the environment, and the nature of God, humanity, and existence.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Pain of Salvation&quot; was devised by Daniel Gildenlöw, who interpreted the name as having &quot;the meaning of balance. Taking the good with the bad. It is also a good expression in everyday use: when something does not go the way you planned, [the phrase &#x27;pain of salvation&#x27;] indicates that this is just a slight setback on an otherwise painless journey towards your goal&quot;.

==Biography==
===Reality and early Pain of Salvation (1984–1996)===
In 1984, an eleven-year-old Daniel Gildenlöw founded the band &quot;Reality&quot; in Eskilstuna, Sweden. One of the early members was Daniel Magdic, who would remain with the band until after Entropia was recorded in 1997. In 1987, Reality participated in the Swedish Annual Music Contest, &quot;Rock-SM&quot;, and were the youngest competitors ever to enter the competition. Daniel Gildenlöw won the category of &quot;Best Vocalist&quot;. In 1990, drummer Johan Langell and bassist Gustaf Hielm joined the band.

Daniel Gildenlöw renamed the band to &quot;Pain of Salvation&quot; in 1991, having reportedly conceived the band&#x27;s name during math class. During the next three years, the band competed in contests and competitions while earning national recognition in the process.

In 1994, Kristoffer Gildenlöw, Daniel&#x27;s younger brother, replaced Hielm on bass. The line-up of the Gildenlöw brothers, Magdic and Langell entered a local studio and recorded the &quot;Hereafter&quot; demo, which the band actively shopped to various record companies. Fredrik Hermansson learned of the band through the &quot;Hereafter&quot; demo and successfully auditioned to become the band&#x27;s keyboardist.

===&quot;Entropia&quot; and &quot;One Hour by the Concrete Lake&quot; (1997–1999)===
In early 1997, Pain of Salvation entered the Roasting House Studio to record their debut album, &quot;Entropia&quot;, which was released in Asia on Avalon Records. &quot;Entropia&quot; was described as &quot;a well-needed breath of fresh air for a genre that was full of self-parody and self-indulgence,&quot; as it was &quot;delivered with emotion, intelligence, integrity, passion, and poignancy&quot;. A &quot;Sea of Tranquility&quot; reviewer also defined the album as Pain of Salvation&#x27;s most &quot;eclectic&quot; release because of the varied song structures and arrangements. The album was also praised for sounding &quot;crisp and fresh.&quot; In 1999, the album was released in Europe by InsideOut Music and in South America by Hellion Records.

Preparations for the band&#x27;s second album were disrupted by the amicable departure of Magdic, who reportedly was unprepared to commit to the increasing demands associated with the band&#x27;s initial success. Magdic was replaced by Johan Hallgren, who had previously played with Daniel Gildenlöw in Crypt of Kerberos. &quot;One Hour by the Concrete Lake&quot; was released in Asia on Avalon Records in July 1998. This album was considered a darker and more complex effort than &quot;Entropia&quot;, with one reviewer noting that &quot;in a world that demands instant gratification, those things for which one must labor to reach usually give greater satisfaction in the end. That is certainly true with this CD&quot;. Another reviewer remarked that it was a more focused effort compared to its predecessor while also noting that it was a concept album which &quot;contains several independent subtopics and, instead of directly telling a story, combines [interesting] lyrical themes in a very unusual and successful way.&quot; Some of the concepts explored are the impact of nuclear waste on the environment and life, in particular at Lake Karachay in the former USSR; indigenous peoples&#x27; rights, displacement, and beliefs; and war and firearms. Pain of Salvation signed with InsideOut Music and later American sibling, InsideOut Music America. The band embarked on a European tour supporting fellow progressive metal bands Threshold and Eldritch. They also played at their first ProgPower festival in Tilburg on 14 November 1999.

===&quot;The Perfect Element, Part I&quot; and &quot;Remedy Lane&quot; (2000–2003)===
After a short break to regroup, Pain of Salvation recorded their third album, &quot;The Perfect Element, Part I&quot; from March to July 2000. Conceptually, &quot;The Perfect Element, Part I&quot; examined an individual&#x27;s formative events during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Released in October 2000, the album was noted for being more straightforward and melodic than the two previous albums, yet retaining the complexity of arrangement and concept. Also, it was defined as &quot;a landmark in the history of prog metal music. It is original, ground-breaking, fresh, and the definitive prog release of the new millennium.&quot; The reviewer stated that &quot;Perfect Element I&quot; marked the beginning of a completely new era for the band and praised the bold experimentation in the songwriting and conceptual development. In support of the album, the band toured Europe from September to October 2000 with Arena. In February 2001 the band headlined ProgPower USA alongside Symphony X and Evergrey.

In late 2001, Pain of Salvation recorded their fourth album, &quot;Remedy Lane&quot;, which was almost entirely written during a two-month period from August to September 2001 by Daniel Gildenlöw. The album, which was described as the band&#x27;s &quot;breakthrough&quot;, was recorded at Roasting House Studio in Sweden. &quot;Remedy Lane&quot; is Daniel Gildenlöw&#x27;s semi-autobiographical meditation on love, lust, and life. The album was released in January 2002. During the Remedy Tour, Pain of Salvation opened for Dream Theater.

On 12 May 2003, Pain of Salvation recorded an acoustic concert in their hometown of Eskilstuna before a crowd of 80. The concert was released as &quot;12:5&quot; in early 2004. It featured dramatically rearranged versions of the band&#x27;s past material. As a result, the band considers the album as a stand-alone work and not merely a live album.

===&quot;BE&quot; and &quot;Scarsick&quot; (2004–2008)===
For much of 2003 and 2004, the band worked on their most ambitious conceptual undertaking to date: a concept album about the nature of God and humanity, which Daniel Gildenlöw had been working on intermittently since 1996. The recording of the album was preceded by a number of live shows in Eskilstuna, where the band performed the album in its entirety. The shows were full productions replete with costumes, stage props, screen projections and the nine-part &quot;Orchestra of Eternity&quot;. After the conclusion of the string of performances, the material was further refined by Daniel Gildenlöw prior to commencing the recording in February 2004.

In September 2004, &quot;BE&quot; was released. The album proved divisive for critics and fans, with AllMusic remarking that &quot;It may be safe to say that never in the history of rock &amp; roll has an album creaked so alarmingly under the weight of such a ponderous concept&quot;. &quot;Sea of Tranquility&quot; commented that &quot;[the album] BE too holds so many undiscovered treasures, and only after a good many spins will it disclose itself to its listeners.&quot; &quot;BE&quot; included a song featuring samples culled from a special phone line that the band set up for fans to record their messages on &quot;God&#x27;s answering machine&quot;. The messages were compiled and presented with a relaxed instrumental accompaniment, resulting in what the band considers to be one of their most touching tracks.
Pain of Salvation did not play in the United States from 2004 to 2013. In 2004, Daniel Gildenlöw expressed his refusal to take part in the U.S. policy of fingerprinting all out-of-country visitors, as well as his contempt for the Bush administration. On 22 January 2009, he announced his support for the newly elected Barack Obama and lifted his embargo on the country. On 21 February 2006, Kristoffer Gildenlöw, unable to attend rehearsals due to his relocation to the Netherlands, was asked to leave the band.

&quot;Scarsick&quot; was released on 22 January 2007. The album again met with mixed reviews. Daniel Gildenlöw said that &quot;Scarsick&quot; is a thematic continuation of &quot;The Perfect Element, Part I&quot;, drawing listeners&#x27; attention to the CD inlay where it reads: &quot;The Perfect Element, Part II - &quot;He&quot;&quot;. Because of his brother&#x27;s departure, Daniel Gildenlöw recorded the bass guitar parts for the album. The band toured Europe and played select international shows, including one in Egypt. Simon Andersson was recruited as touring bassist and, on 10 March 2007, he was made a full member of the band.

On 29 April 2007 the band announced that Johan Langell would depart at the end of the tour due to family commitments. On 6 October 2007, at the &quot;Motstøy&quot; festival in Notodden, the band announced that Langell&#x27;s replacement would be Leo Margarit. Both drummers performed during the show, with Margarit doing a three-minute solo at the end of &quot;Nightmist&quot;. Late in 2008, Simon Andersson left the band to pursue his side projects and recover from the &quot;Scarsick&quot; tour. The band relied on touring musicians Per Schelander (2008–2010) and Daniel Karlsson (2011) for the next three years.

On 13 February 2009, the band announced that they would take part in Dream Theater&#x27;s &quot;Progressive Nation 2009&quot; tour. However, the recent bankruptcy of SPV forced both Pain of Salvation and Beardfish to back out of the tour because of a lack of financial backing.

The &quot;Ending Themes (On the Two Deaths of Pain of Salvation)&quot; DVD was released on 24 March 2009 and featured the band performing in Amsterdam performance. The DVD included a cover of the Leonard Cohen song, &quot;Hallelujah&quot;.

===&quot;Road Salt One&quot; and &quot;Two&quot; (2008–2013)===
On 1 November 2008, the band debuted a new song, &quot;Mortar Grind&quot;, from their upcoming studio album and EP. Pain of Salvation described its next project as a two album concept. However, the project was delayed due to the bankruptcy of SPV, subsidiary InsideOut Music was acquired by Century Media, which allowed the band to finish the albums. By the time that Daniel Gildenlöw returned to the album, he had re-evaluated the double album concept and ultimately decided to split the project into two separate releases.

In December 2009, it was confirmed that the song &quot;Road Salt&quot; would be an entry in the 2010 edition of Melodifestivalen, Sweden&#x27;s national final for the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest. The band performed during the first semi-final and qualified for the runners-up broadcast; however, they lost to Pernilla Wahlgren by a slim margin and did not progress to the finals.

&quot;Road Salt One&quot; was released on 17 May 2010 in most of Europe and on 8 June 2010 in the North America while &quot;Road Salt Two&quot; was released in September 2011. A music video for &quot;Where It Hurts&quot; was also released. The &quot;Road Salt&quot; albums featured a concept that was in sharp contrast to previous undertakings, as Daniel Gildenlöw discusses:

In late 2011 and early 2012, the band&#x27;s lineup underwent significant turmoil, with Johan Hallgren and Fredrik Hermansson leaving at the end of the year, touring bassist Daniel Karlsson joining the band on keyboards, Gustaf Hielm returning on bass guitar, and Ragnar Zolberg joining on guitars.

===&quot;Falling Home&quot;, &quot;In the Passing Light of Day&quot; and &quot;Panther&quot; (2014–present)===

In 2014, the band released &quot;Falling Home&quot;, an acoustic album containing re-imagined versions of their songs, two cover songs, and a brand new song (the title track, &quot;Falling Home&quot;). Around that time, Daniel Gildenlöw contracted a life-threatening flesh eating bacteria. Hospitalized in Uppsala, Sweden, he was forced to sit out of Transatlantic&#x27;s KaLIVEoscope tour.

In 2016, the band released a remixed version of Remedy Lane, as well as &quot;Remedy Lane Re:lived&quot;, a live recording of the album played in its entirety from their appearance at ProgPower USA. During the same year, the band announced a new album, &quot;In the Passing Light of Day&quot;, based upon Gildenlöw&#x27;s hospitalization with a life-threatening streptococcal infection. It was released on 13 January 2017. On 1 May 2017, the band announced the departure of Ragnar Zolberg from the band and the return of previous band member Johan Hallgren.

In 2020, the band announced the release of a new album, &quot;Panther&quot;, set for late August. A single from the album was released in advance titled &quot;Accelerator&quot;. It was also the last album with longtime bassist Gustaf Hielm who had recently departed the band.

<doc id="526609" wikidata="Q2827132" url="?curid=526609" title="Physical abuse">
<text>Physical abuse is any intentional act causing injury or trauma to another person or animal by way of bodily contact. In most cases, children are the victims of physical abuse, but adults can also be victims, as in cases of domestic violence or workplace aggression. Alternative terms sometimes used include physical assault or physical violence, and may also include sexual abuse. Physical abuse may involve more than one abuser, and more than one victim.

==Forms==

Physical abuse means any non-accidental act or behavior causing injury, trauma, or other physical suffering or bodily harm. Abusive acts toward children can often result from parents&#x27; attempts at child discipline through excessive corporal punishment.

==Causes==

A number of causes of physical abuse against children have been identified, the most common of which, according to Mash and Wolfe, being:
* many abusive and neglectful parents have had little exposure to positive parental models and supports.
* there is often a greater degree of stress in the family environment.
* information-processing disturbances may cause maltreating parents to misperceive or mislabel their child&#x27;s behavior, which leads to inappropriate responses.
* there is often a lack of awareness or understanding the appropriate expected mental growth or development.

==Effects==

Physically abused children are at risk for later interpersonal problems involving aggressive behavior, and adolescents are at a much greater risk for substance use disorders. In addition, symptoms of depression, emotional distress, and suicidal ideation are also common features of people who have been physically abused. Studies have also shown that children with a history of physical abuse may meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As many as one-third of children who experience physical abuse are also at risk to become abusive as adults.

Researchers have pointed to other potential psycho-biological effects of child physical abuse on parenting, when abused children become adults. These recent findings may, at least in part, be carried forward by epigenetic changes that impact the regulation of stress physiology.

==Treatment==
Evidence-based interventions for physical abuse include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as well as video-feedback interventions and child-parent psychodynamic psychotherapy; all of which specifically target anger patterns and distorted beliefs, and offer training and/or reflection, support, and modelling that focuses on parenting skills and expectations, as well as increasing empathy for the child by supporting the parent&#x27;s taking the child&#x27;s perspective.

These forms of treatment may include training in social competence and management of daily demands in an effort to decrease parental stress, which is a known risk factor for physical abuse. Although these treatment and prevention strategies are to help children and parents of children who have been abused, some of these methods can also be applied to adults who have physically abused.

==Other animals==

Physical abuse has also been observed among Adélie penguins in Antarctica.

<doc id="526616" wikidata="Q427883" url="?curid=526616" title="Elder abuse">
<text>Elder abuse (also called elder mistreatment, senior abuse, abuse in later life, abuse of older adults, abuse of older women, and abuse of older men) is a single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust, which causes harm or distress to an older person. This definition has been adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) from a definition put forward by Hourglass (formerly Action on Elder Abuse) in the UK. Laws protecting the elderly from abuse are similar to and related to laws protecting dependent adults from abuse.

Elder abuse includes harms by people an older person knows or has a relationship with, such as a spouse, partner, or family member, a friend or neighbor, or people an older person relies on for services. Many forms of elder abuse are recognized as types of domestic violence or family violence since they are committed by family members. Paid caregivers have also been known to prey on elderly patients.

While a variety of circumstances are considered elder abuse, it does not include general criminal activities against older persons, such as home break-ins, robbery or muggings in the street, or &quot;distraction burglary,&quot; where a stranger distracts an older person at the doorstep while another person enters the property to steal.

Over the years, government agencies and community professional groups worldwide have specified elder abuse as a social problem. In 2002, WHO brought international attention to the issue of elder abuse. In 2006, the International Network for Prevention of Elder Abuse (INPEA) designated June 15 as &quot;World Elder Abuse Awareness Day&quot; (WEAAD). An increasing number of events are held across the globe on this day to raise awareness of elder abuse and highlight ways to challenge it.

==Types==
In essence, elder abuse involves the use of power and control to harm the well-being and status of an older person. Although there are common themes of elder abuse across nations, elder abuse differs within nations according to the history, culture, and economic strength of older people, as well as the way older people are perceived. 

Several types of elder abuse are generally recognized, including:

* Physical abuse: e.g. hitting, punching, slapping, burning, pushing, kicking, restraining, falsely imprisoning or confining, or giving excessive or improper medication, or withholding treatment or medication.
*Psychological, emotional abuse: e.g. humiliating a person. A perpetrator may identify something that matters to an older person and then use that knowledge to coerce an older person into a particular action. The abuse may take verbal forms such as yelling, blaming, accusing, name-calling, ridiculing, or constantly criticizing, or may take nonverbal forms such as ignoring, shunning, treating with silence, or withdrawing affection.
* Financial abuse: also known as financial exploitation or economic abuse, involving misappropriation of financial resources by family members, caregivers, or strangers, or the use of financial means to control the person or facilitate other types of abuse. Also, failure to pay financial support to impoverished elders in jurisdictions which have filial responsibility laws, such as France, Germany, and most of the United States.
* Sexual abuse: e.g. forcing a person to take part in any sexual activity without consent, including forcing them to participate in conversations of a sexual nature against their will; which may also include situations where the person is no longer able to give consent (dementia).
* Neglect: e.g. depriving a person of proper medical treatment, food, heat, clothing, comfort, or essential medication, or depriving a person of needed services, to force certain kinds of actions, financial and otherwise. Neglect can include leaving unattended an elder person who is at risk (for example, from a fall). The deprivation may be intentional (active neglect) or happen out of lack of knowledge or resources (passive neglect).

In addition, some U.S. state laws also recognize the following as elder abuse:
* Abandonment: deserting a dependent person with the intent to abandon them or leave them unattended long enough to endanger their health or welfare.
* Rights abuse: denying the civil and constitutional rights of a person who is old but not declared by a court to be mentally incompetent. This is an aspect of elder abuse increasingly being recognized by nations.
* Self-neglect: neglecting oneself by not caring about one&#x27;s own health, well-being or safety. Self-neglect (harm by self) is treated as conceptually different than abuse (harm by others). Elder self-neglect can lead to illness, injury, or even death. Common needs that older adults may deny themselves or ignore include the following: sustenance (food or water); cleanliness (bathing and personal hygiene); adequate clothing for climate protection; proper shelter; adequate safety; clean and healthy surroundings; medical attention for serious illness; and essential medications. Self-neglect is often created by an individual&#x27;s declining mental awareness or capability. Some older adults may choose to deny themselves some health or safety benefits, which may not be self-neglect. This may simply be their personal choice. Caregivers and other responsible individuals must honor these choices if the older adult is sound of mind. In other instances, the older adult may lack the needed resources, as a result of poverty, or other social conditions. This is also not considered &quot;self-neglect.&quot;
* Institutional abuse refers to physical or psychological harm, as well as rights violations in settings where care and assistance is provided to dependent older adults or others, such as nursing homes. Recent studies of approximately 2,000 nursing home facility residents in the United States reported a growing abuse rate of 44% and neglect up to 95%, making elder abuse in nursing homes a growing danger. Exact statistics are rare due to elder abuse in general and specifically in nursing homes being a silent condition.

==Warning signs==
The key to prevention and intervention of elder abuse is the ability to recognize the warning signs of its occurrence. Signs of elder abuse differ depending on the type of abuse the victim is suffering. Each type of abuse has distinct signs associated with it.

* Physical abuse can be detected by visible signs on the body including bruises, scratches, scars, sprains, or broken bones. More subtle indications of physical abuse include signs of restraint such as rope marks on the wrist or broken eyeglasses.
* Emotional abuse often accompanies other types of abuse and can usually be detected by changes in an elder person&#x27;s personality or behavior. The elder may also exhibit behavior mimicking dementia, such as rocking or mumbling. Emotional abuse is the most underreported form of elder abuse. Elder abuse occurs when a person fails to treat an elder with respect, and it may include verbal abuse. The elder experiences social isolation or lack of acknowledgement. One indicator of emotional abuse is the elder adult&#x27;s being unresponsive or uncommunicative. They can also be unreasonably suspicious or fearful, more isolated, and not wanting to be as social as they may have been before. Emotional abuse is underreported but can have the most damaging effects because it leads to more physical and mental health problems.
* Financial exploitation is a more subtle form of abuse and may be more challenging to notice. Signs of financial exploitation include unpaid bills, purchases of unnecessary goods or services, significant withdrawals from accounts, and belongings or money missing from the home. 
* Sexual abuse, like physical abuse, can be detected by visible signs on the body, especially around the breasts or genital area. Other signs include inexplicable infections, bleeding, and torn underclothing. 
* Neglect can be inflicted by either a caregiver or oneself. Signs of neglect include malnutrition and dehydration, poor hygiene, noncompliance with a medical prescription, and unsafe living conditions.

In addition to observing signs in the elderly individual, one can also detect abuse by monitoring changes in the caregiver&#x27;s behavior. For example, the caregiver may not allow them to speak to or receive visitors or may exhibit indifference or a lack of affection towards the elder or refer to the elder as &quot;a burden.&quot; Caregivers who have a history of substance abuse or mental illness are more likely to commit elder abuse than other individuals.

Abuse can sometimes be subtle and therefore difficult to detect. Regardless, awareness organizations and research advise that one take any suspicion seriously and address concerns adequately and immediately.

===Signs===
* Lack of medical aids such as glasses, walker, hearing aids.
* Signs of emotional trauma.
* Broken eyeglasses/frames, or physical signs of punishment or being restrained.
* Signs of insufficient care or unpaid bills despite adequate financial resources.
* Broken bones (fractures)
* Poor physical appearance
* Changes in mental status
* Frequent infections
* Bruising, scratches, welts, or cuts.
* Unexplained weight loss
* Refusal to speak
* Signs of dehydration
* Lack of cleanliness

==Health consequences==
The health consequences of elder abuse are serious. Elder abuse can destroy an elderly person&#x27;s quality of life in the forms of:
* Declining functional abilities
* Increased dependency, sense of helplessness, and stress.
* Worsening psychological decline
* Premature mortality and morbidity
* Depression and dementia
* Malnutrition
* Bedsores
* Death

The risk of death for elder abuse victims is three times higher than for non-victims.

==Perpetrators==
An abuser can be a caregiver, spouse, partner, relative, friend, neighbor, volunteer worker, paid worker, practitioner, solicitor, or any other individual with the intent to deprive a vulnerable person of their resources. Relatives include adult children and their spouses or partners, their offspring, and other extended family members. Children and living relatives who have a history of substance abuse or have had other life troubles are of particular concern. For example, Hybrid Financial Exploitation (HFE) abusive individuals are more likely to be a relative, chronically unemployed, and dependent on the elderly person. Additionally, past studies have estimated that between 16 percent and 38 percent of all elder abusers have a history of mental illness. Elder abuse perpetrated by individuals with mental illnesses can be decreased by lessening the level of dependency that persons with serious mental illness have on family members. This can be done by funneling more resources into housing assistance programs, intensive care management services, and better welfare benefits for individuals with serious mental illness. People with substance abuse and mental health disorders typically have very small social networks, and this confinement contributes to the overall occurrence of elder abuse.

Perpetrators of elder abuse can include anyone in a position of trust, control or authority over the individual. Family relationships, neighbors and friends, are all socially considered relationships of trust, whether or not the older adult actually thinks of the people as &quot;trustworthy.&quot; Some perpetrators may &quot;groom&quot; an older person (befriend or build a relationship with them) in order to establish a relationship of trust. Older people living alone who have no adult children living nearby are particularly vulnerable to &quot;grooming&quot; by neighbors and friends who would hope to gain control of their estates.

The majority of abusers are relatives, typically the older adult&#x27;s spouse/partner or sons and daughters, although the type of abuse differs according to the relationship. In some situations the abuse is &quot;domestic violence grown old,&quot; a situation in which the abusive behavior of a spouse or partner continues into old age. In some situations, an older couple may be attempting to care and support each other and failing, in the absence of external support. In the case of sons and daughters, it tends to be that of financial abuse, justified by a belief that it is nothing more than the &quot;advance inheritance&quot; of property, valuables, and money.

Though corporate abusers, such as brokerage firms and bank trust companies have been considered too regulated to be able to abuse the elderly, cases of such abuse have been reported. Such corporate abuse might escape notice both because they have more aptitude at methods of abuse that can go undetected and because they are protected by attorneys and the government in ways that individuals are not. 

Within paid care environments, abuse can occur for a variety of reasons. Some abuse is the willful act of cruelty inflicted by a single individual upon an older person. In fact, a case study in Canada suggests that the high elder abuse statistics are from repeat offenders who, like in other forms of abuse, practice elder abuse for the schadenfreude associated with the act. More commonly, institutional abuses or neglect may reflect lack of knowledge, lack of training, lack of support, or insufficient resourcing. Institutional abuse may be the consequence of common practices or processes that are part of running of a care institution or service. Sometimes this type of abuse is referred to as &quot;poor practice,&quot; although this term reflects the motive of the perpetrator (the causation) rather than the impact upon the older person.

Elder abuse is not a direct parallel to child maltreatment, as perpetrators of elder abuse do not have the same legal protection of rights as parents of children do. For example, a court order is needed to remove a child from their home but not to remove a victim of elder abuse from theirs.

==Risk factors==
Various risk factors increase the likelihood that an elderly person will become a victim of elder abuse, including an elderly person who:
* Has memory problems (such as dementia).
* Has a mental illness, either long-standing or recent.
* Has physical disabilities.
* Has depression, loneliness, or lack of social support.
* Abuses alcohol or other substances.
* Takes prescribed medications that impair judgment.
* Is verbally or physically combative with the caregiver.
* Has a shared living situation.
* Has a criminal history.
Several other risk factors increase the likelihood that a caregiver will participate in elder abuse, including a caregiver who:
* Feels overwhelmed or resentful.
* Has a history of substance abuse or a history of abusing others.
* Is dependent on the older person for housing, finances, or other needs.
* Has mental health problems.
* Is unemployed.
* Has a criminal history.
* Has a shared living situation.

In addition:
* Lower income or poverty has been found to be associated with elder abuse. Low economic resources have been conceptualized as a contextual or situational stress or contributing to elder abuse.
* Living with a large number of household members other than a spouse is associated with an increased risk of abuse, especially financial abuse.

Risk factors can also be categorized into individual, relationship, community, and sociocultural levels. At the individual level, elders who have poor physical and mental health are at higher risk. At the relationship level, a shared living situation is a huge risk factor for the elderly, and living in the same area as the abuser is more likely to result in abuse. At the community level, caregivers may knowingly or inadvertently cause social isolation of the elderly. At the sociocultural level, being represented as weak and dependent, having a lack of funds to pay for care, needing assistance but living alone, and having bonds between generations of a family destroyed are possible factors in elder abuse.

==Increase of Elder Abuse in the United States==
The number of incidents of elder abuse is increasing exponentially due to the rapidly growing population of older people. It is predicted that in the next thirty years, the number of Americans over the age of forty is going to quadruple. Not only that, by the year 2054, senior citizens will make up roughly a quarter of the total population, numbering to around 84 million. With these statistics, we can only assume that with less young people proportionally to take care for these elderly, there will be more stress on the care providers. Some factors that increase the risk for elder abuse is having health problems and low social support, which are both common problems among senior citizens and likely to be more so with a larger population to take care of.For this reason, as the proportions of young people to older people decreases we likely will see more and more strain on the system of protection and care for elders&#x27; well-being, and increased rates of violence, neglect, and mistreatment. Undoubtedly, with more older people there will be more incidents of abuse, as this is simply mathematical.

Financial stress is another factor leading to an increased rate of abuse and exploitation amongst the elderly. With an ever-climbing cost of living and an uncertain future for those receiving social security, financial difficulties are undoubtedly going to continue to be a serious problem for these older generations. Social Security is a vital form of financial support for retirees, accounting for “half of the household income for adults aged 62 and older, according to the U.S. Census. But it is under threat, with the Social Security Administration making a statement that funds are expected to “be exhausted” by 2037 if drastic action isn&#x27;t taken soon. This is all quite dire for a population of vulnerable adults who may have physical and mental limitations that prevent them from working and receiving income. More than that, retirement was once seen as a human right for working adults over the age of 60.The National Council of Aging also states that the cost of living adjustment for Social Security benefits “is nowhere near enough to allow older adults to afford their true cost of living.&quot; and that the poverty rate amongst seniors was as high as 14% in 2023. This is all quite alarming considering that the monthly media n cost of nursing home care was $8,669 for a shared room and $9,733 for a private room according to the NCOA (Person, 2025.) In 2022 only 15% of single adults aged 75 or older could even afford the costs of housing and long-term care, even though 70% of adults ages 65 and older will require long term care services at some point.With poverty being a risk factor for elder abuse, it is almost certain that these economic strains will only lead to more likelihood of elder abuse. Without the government&#x27;s help, many elderly people will have to depend on family members for support, putting an even greater strain on family relations and their finances. In a survey of caregivers done in California, 44.4% of California&#x27;s estimated 6.7 million adult caregivers reported experiencing some level of financial stress in 2020, with 1 in 5 reporting “extreme financial stress.&quot; Given as we know that the majority of abuse cases in the aged are caused by family members, these statistics are not too comforting caregivers. Therefore, we can see that the future economic situation is going to be a catalyst for further abuse of the elderly and unsafe living conditions.

A decreased access to care for senior citizens is also a reason for an increased rate of abuse. Many care facilities are also struggling to stay open. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says that 81% of them would need to hire additional workers to meet nursing staff requirements. If they don&#x27;t, they will likely have to close. According to the American Health Care Association, 46 percent of nursing homes are limiting their new admissions, and 57 percent of nursing homes have a waiting list. This means that those who need assisted living right away might be left waiting even though they have nowhere else to go. Since 2020, there has been a drastic decrease in nursing home beds as well as a closure of units or floors or wings of nursing homes in 20% of facilities due to labor shortages. These closures alone in recent years have displaced 28,421 residents. As we know, with an increase in elderly population there is more need for placement than ever. Unfortunately, it is also true that with underpaid or overworked staff, abuse will increase, as it is reported that 13% of cases are from medical caregivers.We can assume with less nursing care facilities much of the care will be handed to family members, who may be inadequately trained to care for aging family members and their medical needs. For this reason, neglect, negligence, and elder cruelty will likely increase as we face a shortage of care facilities in the years to come.

==Research and statistics==
There has been a general lack of reliable data in this area and it is often argued that the absence of data is a reflection of the low priority given to work associated with older people. However, over the past decade there has been a growing amount of research into the nature and extent of elder abuse. The research still varies considerably in the definitions being used, who is being asked, and what is being asked. As a result, the statistics used in this area vary considerably.

One study suggests that around 25% of vulnerable older adults will report abuse in the previous month, totaling up to 6% of the general elderly population. However, some consistent themes are beginning to emerge from interactions with abused elders, and through limited and small scale research projects. Work undertaken in Canada suggests that approximately 70% of elder abuse is perpetrated against women and this is supported by evidence from the Hourglass helpline in the UK, which identifies women as victims in 67% of calls. Also domestic violence in later life may be a continuation of long term partner abuse and in some cases, abuse may begin with retirement or the onset of a health condition. Certainly, abuse increases with age, with 78 percent of victims being over 70 years of age.

The higher proportion of spousal homicides supports the suggestion that abuse of older women is often a continuation of long term spousal abuse against women. In contrast, the risk of homicide for older men was far greater outside the family than within. This is an important point because the domestic violence of older people is often not recognized and consequently strategies, which have proved effective within the domestic violence arena, have not been routinely transferred into circumstances involving the family abuse of older people.

According to the Hourglass helpline in the UK, abuse occurs primarily in the family home (64%), followed by residential care (23%), and then hospitals (5%), although a helpline does not necessarily provide a true reflection of such situations as it is based upon the physical and mental ability of people to utilize such a resource.

Research conducted in New Zealand broadly supports the above findings, with some variations. Of 1288 cases in 2002–2004, 1201 individuals, 42 couples, and 45 groups were found to have been abused. Of these, 70 percent were female. Psychological abuse (59%), followed by material/financial (42%), and physical abuse (12%) were the most frequently identified types of abuse. Sexual abuse occurred in 2% of reported cases.
Age Concern New Zealand found that most abusers are family members (70%), most commonly sons or daughters (40%). Older abusers (those over 65 years) are more likely to be husbands.

In 2007, 4766 cases of suspected abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation involving older adults were reported, an increase of 9 percent over 2006. 19 incidents were related to a death, and a total of 303 incidents were considered life-threatening. About one in 11 incidents involved a life-threatening or fatal situation.

In 2012, the study called &quot;Pure Financial Exploitation vs. Hybrid Exploitation Co-Occurring With Physical Abuse and/or Neglect of Elderly Persons&quot; by Shelly L. Jackson and Thomas L. Hafemeister brought attention to the hybrid abuse that elderly persons can experience. This study revealed that victims of hybrid financial exploitation or HFE lost an average of $185,574, a range of $20–$750,000.

===Barriers to obtaining statistics===
Several conditions make it hard for researchers to obtain accurate statistics on elder abuse. Researchers may have difficulty obtaining accurate elder abuse statistics for the following reasons:

* Elder abuse is largely a hidden problem and tends to be committed in the privacy of the elderly person&#x27;s home, mostly by his or her family members.
*Elder abuse victims are often unwilling to report their abuse for fear of others&#x27; disbelief, fear of loss of independence, fear of being institutionalized, fear of losing their only social support (especially if the perpetrator is a relative), and fear of being subject to future retaliation by the perpetrator(s).
* Elder abuse victims&#x27; cognitive decline and ill health may prevent them from reporting their abuse.
* Lack of proper training of service providers, such as social workers, law enforcement, nurses, etc., about elder abuse, therefore the number of cases reported tends to be low.
* The subjective nature of elder abuse, which largely depends on one&#x27;s interpretation.
* Another reason why there is a lack of accurate statistics is the debate of whether to include self-neglect or not. Many are unsure if it should be included since it does not involve another person as an abuser. Those opposed to the inclusion of self-neglect make the claim that it is a different form of abuse and thus, should not be included in the statistics. Due to this discrepancy and the others mentioned above, it is difficult to get accurate data concerning the abuse of the elderly.

==Prevention==

Doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel can play a vital role in assisting elder abuse victims. Studies have shown that elderly individuals, on average, make 13.9 visits per year to a physician. Although there has been an increase in awareness of elder abuse over the years, physicians tend to only report 2% of elder abuse cases. Reasons for lack of reporting by physicians include a lack of current knowledge concerning state laws on elder abuse, concern about angering the abuser and ruining the relationship with the elderly patient, possible court appearances, lack of cooperation from elderly patients or families, and lack of time and reimbursement. Through education and training about elder abuse, health care professionals can better assist elder abuse victims.

Educating and training those in the criminal justice system, such as police, prosecutors, and the judiciary on elder abuse, as well as increased legislation to protect elders, will also help to minimize elder abuse. Increased legislations to protect elders and will also provide improved assistance to victims of elder abuse.

In addition, community involvement in responding to elder abuse can contribute to elderly persons&#x27; safety. In general, preventing the occurrence or recurrence of elder abuse helps not only the elder but it may also improve the anxiety and depression of their caregivers too. Communities can develop programs that are structured around meeting the needs of elderly persons. For example, several communities throughout the United States have created Financial Abuse Specialist Teams, which are multidisciplinary groups that consist of public and private professionals who volunteer their time to advise Adult Protective Services (APS), law enforcement, and private attorneys on matters of vulnerable adult financial abuse.

== False accusations ==
It is important to recognize that false accusations of elder abuse are very common. An elderly person who has dementia or a mental illness may falsely claim to be a victim of abuse. By one estimate, 70% of elderly people with mental impairments such as dementia, delusions, or paranoia falsely accuse caregivers of stealing. Mentally impaired elders may claim that a caregiver is feeding them poisoned food or holding them prisoner. Websites such as Alzlive.com and DailyCaring.com offer advice for caregivers who are falsely accused of elder abuse or other crimes.

<text>Psychological abuse, often known as emotional abuse or mental abuse or psychological violence or non-physical abuse, is a form of abusecharacterized by a person subjecting or exposing another person to a behavior that may result in psychological trauma, including anxiety, chronic depression, clinical depression or post-traumatic stress disorder amongst other psychological problems.

It is often associated with situations of power imbalance in abusive relationships, and may include bullying, gaslighting, abuse in the workplace, amongst other behaviors that may cause an individual to feel unsafe. It also may be perpetrated by persons conducting torture, other violence, acute or prolonged human rights abuse, particularly without legal redress such as detention without trial, false accusations, false convictions, and extreme defamation such as where perpetrated by state and media.

== General definition ==
Clinicians and researchers have offered different definitions of psychological abuse. According to current research the terms &quot;psychological abuse&quot; and &quot;emotional abuse&quot; can be used interchangeably, unless associated with psychological violence. More specifically, &quot;emotional abuse&quot; is any abuse that is emotional rather than physical. It can include anything from verbal abuse and constant criticism to more subtle tactics such as intimidation, manipulation, and refusal to ever be pleased. This abuse occurs when someone uses words or actions to try and control the other person, to keep someone afraid or isolated, or try to break someone&#x27;s self-esteem.

Emotional abuse can take several forms. Three general patterns of abusive behavior include aggressing, denying, and minimizing; &quot;Withholding is another form of denying. Withholding includes refusing to listen, to communicate, and emotionally withdrawing as punishment.&quot; Even though there is no established definition for emotional abuse, emotional abuse can possess a definition beyond verbal and psychological abuse. Blaming, shaming, and name calling are a few verbally abusive behaviors that can affect a victim emotionally. The victim&#x27;s self-worth and emotional well-being are altered and even diminished by the verbal abuse, resulting in an emotionally abused victim.

The victim may experience severe psychological effects. This would involve the tactics of brainwashing, which can fall under psychological abuse as well, but emotional abuse consists of the manipulation of the victim&#x27;s emotions. The victim may feel their emotions are being affected by the abuser to such an extent that the victim may no longer recognize their own feelings regarding the issues the abuser is trying to control. The result is the victim&#x27;s self-concept and independence are systematically taken away.

The U.S. Department of Justice defines emotionally abusive traits as causing fear by intimidation, threatening physical harm to self, partner, children, or partner&#x27;s family or friends, destruction of pets and property, and forcing isolation from family, friends, or school or work. More subtle emotionally abusive behaviors include insults, putdowns, arbitrary and unpredictable behavior, and gaslighting (e.g. the denial that previous abusive incidents occurred). Modern technology has led to new forms of abuse, by text messaging and online cyber-bullying.

In 1996, Health Canada argued that emotional abuse is &quot;based on power and control&quot;, and defines emotional abuse as including rejecting, degrading, terrorizing, isolating, corrupting/exploiting and &quot;denying emotional responsiveness&quot; as characteristic of emotional abuse.

Several studies have argued that an isolated incident of verbal aggression, dominant conduct or jealous behaviors does not constitute the term &quot;psychological abuse&quot;. Rather, it is defined by a pattern of such behaviors, unlike physical and sexual maltreatment where only one incident is necessary to label it as abuse. Tomison and Tucci write, &quot;emotional abuse is characterized by a climate or pattern of behavior(s) occurring over time ... Thus, &#x27;sustained&#x27; and &#x27;repetitive&#x27; are the crucial components of any definition of emotional abuse.&quot; Andrew Vachss, an author, attorney, and former sex crimes investigator, defines emotional abuse as &quot;the systematic diminishment of another. It may be intentional or subconscious (or both), but it is always a course of conduct, not a single event.&quot;

== Prevalence ==

=== Intimate relationships ===

When discussing the different types of psychological abuse in terms of domestically violent relationships, it is important to recognize the 4 different types; Denigrating Damage to Partner&#x27;s Self-Image or Esteem, Passive Aggressive Withholding of Emotional Support, Threatening Behavior, and Restricting Personal Territory and Freedom:
* Denigrating Damage refers to an individual using verbal aggression like yelling towards their partner that is delivered as profane and derogatory.
* Passive Aggressive Withholding of Emotional Support refers to an individual intentionally avoiding and withdrawing themselves from their partner in an attempt to be neglectful and emotionally abandoning.
* Threatening Behavior refers to an individual making verbal threats towards their partner that could imply eliciting physical harm, threats of divorce, lying, and threats of reckless behavior that could put their safety at risk.
* Restricting Personal Territory and Freedom refers to the isolation of social support from family and friends. This could include taking away partner&#x27;s autonomy and having a lack of personal boundaries.

It has been reported that at least 80% of women who have entered the criminal justice system due to partner violence have also experienced psychological abuse from their partner. This partner violence is also known as domestic abuse.

Domestic abuse—defined as chronic mistreatment in marriage, families, dating, and other intimate relationships—can include emotionally abusive behavior. Although psychological abuse does not always lead to physical abuse, physical abuse in domestic relationships is nearly always preceded and accompanied by psychological abuse. Murphy and O&#x27;Leary reported that psychological aggression is the most reliable predictor of later physical aggression.

A 2012 review by Capaldi et al., which evaluated risk factors for intimate partner violence (IPV), noted that psychological abuse has been shown to be both associated with and common in IPV. High levels of verbal aggression and relationship conflict, &quot;practically akin to psychological aggression&quot;, strongly predicted IPV; male jealousy in particular was associated with female injuries from IPV.

Attempts to define and describe violence and abuse in hetero-normative intimate relationships can become contentious as different studies present different conclusions about whether men or women are the primary instigators. For instance, a 2005 study by Hamel reports that &quot;men and women physically and emotionally abuse each other at equal rates.&quot; Basile found that psychological aggression was effectively bidirectional in cases where heterosexual and homosexual couples went to court for domestic disturbances.

A 2007 study of Spanish college students aged 18–27 found that psychological aggression (as measured by the Conflict Tactics Scale) is so pervasive in dating relationships that it can be regarded as a normalized element of dating, and that women are substantially more likely to exhibit psychological aggression. Similar findings have been reported in other studies. Strauss et al. found that female intimate partners in heterosexual relationships were more likely than males to use psychological aggression, including threats to hit or throw an object.

A study of young adults by Giordano et al. found that females in intimate heterosexual relationships were more likely than males to threaten to use a knife or gun against their partner. While studies allege that women use violence in intimate relationships as often or more often than men, women&#x27;s violence is typically self-defensive rather than aggressive.

In 1996, the National Clearinghouse on Family Violence, for Health Canada, reported that 39% of married women or common-law wives suffered emotional abuse by husbands/partners; and a 1995 survey of women 15 and over 36–43% reported emotional abuse during childhood or adolescence, and 39% experienced emotional abuse in marriage/dating; this report does not address boys or men suffering emotional abuse from families or intimate partners. A BBC radio documentary on domestic abuse, including emotional maltreatment, reports that 20% of men and 30% of women have been abused by a spouse or other intimate partner.

=== Child emotional abuse ===

Psychological abuse of a child is commonly defined as a pattern of behavior by parents or caregivers that can seriously interfere with a child&#x27;s cognitive, emotional, psychological, or social development. According to the DSM-5, Child Psychological Abuse is defined as verbal or symbolic acts given by parent or caregiver which can result in significant psychological harm. Examples are yelling, comparing to others, name-calling, blaming, gaslighting, manipulating, and normalizing abuse due to the status of being underage.

Some parents may emotionally and psychologically harm their children because of stress, poor parenting skills, social isolation, and lack of available resources or inappropriate expectations of their children. Straus and Field report that psychological aggression is a pervasive trait of American families: &quot;verbal attacks on children, like physical attacks, are so prevalent as to be just about universal.&quot; A 2008 study by English, et al. found that fathers and mothers were equally likely to be verbally aggressive towards their children.

=== Elder emotional abuse ===

Choi and Mayer performed a study on elder abuse (causing harm or distress to an older person), with results showing that 10.5% of the participants were victims of &quot;emotional/psychological abuse&quot;, which was most often perpetrated by a son or other relative of the victim. Of 1288 cases in 2002–2004, 1201 individuals, 42 couples, and 45 groups were found to have been abused. Of these, 70% were female. Psychological abuse (59%) and material/financial abuse (42%) were the most frequently identified types of abuse. One study found that the overall prevalence rate of abused elderly in Hong Kong was 21.4%. Out of this percentage, 20.8% reported being verbally abused.

=== Workplace ===

Rates of reported emotional abuse in the workplace vary, with studies showing 10%, 24%, and 36% of respondents indicating persistent and substantial emotional abuse from coworkers.
Keashly and Jagatic found that males and females commit &quot;emotionally abusive behaviors&quot; in the workplace at roughly similar rates. In a web-based survey, Namie found that women were more likely to engage in workplace bullying, such as name calling, and that the average length of abuse was 16.5 months.

Pai and Lee found that the incidence of workplace violence typically occurs more often in younger workers. &quot;Younger age may be a reflection of lack of job experience, resulting in [an inability] to identify or prevent potentially abusive situations... Another finding showed that lower education is a risk factor for violence.&quot; This study also reports that 51.4% of the workers surveyed have already experienced verbal abuse, and 29.8% of them have encountered workplace bullying and mobbing.

== Characteristics of abusers ==

In their review of data from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (a longitudinal birth cohort study) Moffitt et al. report that while men exhibit more aggression overall, sex is not a reliable predictor of interpersonal aggression, including psychological aggression.

The DARVO study found that no matter what gender a person is, aggressive people share a cluster of traits, including high rates of suspicion and jealousy; sudden and drastic mood swings; poor self-control; and higher than average rates of approval of violence and aggression. Moffitt et al. also argue that antisocial men exhibit two distinct types of interpersonal aggression (one against strangers, the other against intimate female partners), while antisocial women are rarely aggressive against anyone other than intimate male partners or their own children.

Abusers may aim to avoid household chores or exercise total control of family finances. Abusers can be very manipulative, often recruiting friends, law officers and court officials, and even the victim&#x27;s family to their side, while shifting blame to the victim. A victim may internalize the abuse and may form future relationships with abusers.

== Effects ==

=== Abuse of intimate partners ===
Most victims of psychological abuse within intimate relationships often experience changes to their psyche and actions. This varies throughout the various types and lengths of emotional abuse. Long-term emotional abuse has long term debilitating effects on a person&#x27;s sense of self and integrity. Often, research shows that emotional abuse is a precursor to physical abuse when three particular forms of emotional abuse are present in the relationship: threats, restriction of the abused party and damage to the victim&#x27;s property.

Psychological abuse is often not recognized by survivors of domestic violence as abuse. A study of college students by Goldsmith and Freyd report that many who have experienced emotional abuse do not characterize the mistreatment as abusive. Additionally, Goldsmith and Freyd show that these people also tend to exhibit higher than average rates of alexithymia (difficulty identifying and processing their own emotions). This is often the case when referring to victims of abuse within intimate relationships, as non-recognition of the actions as abuse may be a coping or defense mechanism in order to either seek to master, minimize or tolerate stress or conflict.

Marital or relationship dissatisfaction can be caused by psychological abuse or aggression. In a 2007 study, Laurent et al. report that psychological aggression in young couples is associated with decreased satisfaction for both partners: &quot;psychological aggression may serve as an impediment to couples&#x27; development because it reflects less mature coercive tactics and an inability to balance self/other needs effectively.&quot; In a 2008 study on relationship dissatisfaction in adolescents Walsh and Shulman explain, &quot;The more psychologically aggressive females were, the less satisfied were both partners. The unique importance of males&#x27; behavior was found in the form of withdrawal, a less mature conflict negotiation strategy. Males&#x27; withdrawal during joint discussions predicted increased satisfaction.&quot;

There are many different responses to psychological abuse. Jacobson et al. found that women report markedly higher rates of fear during marital conflicts. However, a rejoinder argued that Jacobson&#x27;s results were invalid due to men and women&#x27;s drastically differing interpretations of questionnaires. Coker et al. found that the effects of mental abuse were similar whether the victim was male or female. A 1998 study of male college students by Simonelli &amp; Ingram found that men who were emotionally abused by their female partners exhibited higher rates of chronic depression than the general population. Pimlott-Kubiak and Cortina found that severity and duration of abuse were the only accurate predictors of after effects of abuse; sex of perpetrator or victim were not reliable predictors.

=== Abuse of children ===
The effects of psychological abuse on children can involve a variety of mental health concerns such as post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, personality disorders, low self-esteem, aggression, anxiety, and emotional unresponsiveness. These effects can be exemplified by the constant criticism, regular living with threats, or being rejected, that can be exemplified by withholding love and support as well as not having any guidance from the guardians of the children.

English et al. report that children specifically whose families are characterized by interpersonal violence, including psychological aggression and verbal aggression, may exhibit these disorders. Additionally, English et al. report that the impact of emotional abuse &quot;did not differ significantly&quot; from that of physical abuse. Johnson et al. report that, in a survey of female patients, 24% suffered emotional abuse, and that this group experienced higher rates of gynecological problems. In their study of men emotionally abused by a wife/partner or parent, Hines and Malley-Morrison report that victims exhibit high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and drug addiction, including alcoholism.

Glaser reports, &quot;An infant who is severely deprived of basic emotional nurturance, even though physically well cared for, can fail to thrive and can eventually die. Babies with less severe emotional deprivation can grow into anxious and insecure children who are slow to develop and who have low self-esteem.&quot; Glaser also informs that the abuse impacts the child in a number of ways, especially on their behavior, including: &quot;insecurity, poor self-esteem, destructive behavior, angry acts (such as fire setting and animal cruelty), withdrawal, poor development of basic skills, alcohol or drug abuse, suicide, difficulty forming relationships and unstable job histories.&quot;

Oberlander et al. performed a study which discovered that among the youth, those with a history of maltreatment showed that emotional distress is a predictor of early initiation of sexual intercourse. Oberlander et al. state, &quot;A childhood history of maltreatment, including... psychological abuse, and neglect, has been identified as a risk factor for early initiation of sexual intercourse ... In families where child maltreatment had occurred, children were more likely to experience heightened emotional distress and subsequently to engage in sexual intercourse by age 14. It is possible that maltreated youth feel disconnected from families that did not protect them and subsequently seek sexual relationships to gain support, seek companionship, or enhance their standing with peers.&quot; It is apparent that psychological abuse sustained during childhood is a predictor of the onset of sexual conduct occurring earlier in life, as opposed to later.

=== Abuse in the workplace ===
Psychological abuse has been found present within the workplace as evidenced by previous research. Namie&#x27;s study of workplace emotional abuse found that 31% of women and 21% of men who reported workplace emotional abuse exhibited three key symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (hypervigilance, intrusive imagery, and avoidance behaviors). The most common psychological, professional, financial, and social effects of sexual harassment and retaliation are as follows:
* Psychological stress and health impairment, loss of motivation.
* Decreased work or school performance as a result of stressful conditions; increased absenteeism in fear of harassment repetition.
* Having to drop courses, change academic plans, or leave school (loss of tuition) in fear of harassment repetition or as a result of stress.
* Being objectified and humiliated by scrutiny and gossip.
* Loss of trust in environments similar to where the harassment occurred.
* Loss of trust in the types of people that occupy similar positions as the harasser or their colleagues, especially in cases where they are not supportive, difficulties or stress on peer relationships, or relationships with colleagues.
* Effects on sexual life and relationships: can put extreme stress upon relationships with significant others, sometimes resulting in divorce.
* Weakening of support network, or being ostracized from professional or academic circles (friends, colleagues, or family may distance themselves from the victim, or shun him or her altogether).
* Depression, anxiety or panic attacks.
* Sleeplessness or nightmares, difficulty concentrating, headaches, fatigue.
* Eating disorders (weight loss or gain), alcoholism, and feeling powerless or out of control.

== Abuse of the elderly ==
Elderly who have suffered psychological abuse have been found to experience similar outcomes as other population groups such as depression, anxiety, feelings of isolation and neglect, and powerlessness. One study examined 355 Chinese elderly participants (60 and older) and found that 75% of reported abusers were grown-up children of the elderly. Within this study, these individuals suffered outcomes from the abuse, specifically verbal abuse which contributed to their psychological distress.

== Prevention ==

=== In intimate relationships ===
Recognition of abuse is the first step to prevention. It is often difficult for abuse victims to acknowledge their situation and to seek help. For those who &quot;do&quot; seek help, research has shown that people who participate in an intimate partner violence prevention program report less psychological aggression toward their targets of psychological abuse, and reported victimization from psychological abuse decreased over time for the treatment group.

There are non-profit organizations that provide support and prevention services such as the National Domestic Violence Hotline, The Salvation Army, and Benefits.gov.

=== In the family ===
Child abuse in the sole form of emotional/psychological maltreatment is often the most difficult to identify and prevent, as government organizations, such as Child Protective Services in the US, is often the only method of intervention, and the institute &quot;must have demonstrable evidence that harm to a child has been done before they can intervene. Due to this a lot of victims may stay in the care of their abuser. Since emotional abuse doesn&#x27;t result in physical evidence such as bruising or malnutrition, it can be very hard to diagnose.&quot; Some researchers have, however, begun to develop methods to diagnose and treat such abuse, including the ability to: identify risk factors, provide resources to victims and their families, and ask appropriate questions to help identify the abuse.

=== In the workplace ===
The majority of companies within the United States provide access to a human resources department, in which to report cases of psychological/emotional abuse. Also, many managers are required to participate in conflict management programs, in order to ensure the workplace maintains an &quot;open and respectful atmosphere, with tolerance for diversity and where the existence of interpersonal frustration and friction is accepted but also properly managed.&quot; Organizations must adopt zero-tolerance policies for professional verbal abuse. Education and coaching are needed to help employees to improve their skills when responding to professional-to-professional verbal abuse.

== Popular perceptions ==
Several studies found double standards in how people tend to view emotional abuse by men versus emotional abuse by women. Follingstad et al. found that, when rating hypothetical vignettes of psychological abuse in marriages, professional psychologists tend to rate male abuse of females as more serious than identical scenarios describing female abuse of males: &quot;the stereotypical association between physical aggression and males appears to extend to an association of psychological abuse and males&quot;.

Similarly, Sorenson and Taylor randomly surveyed a group of Los Angeles, California residents for their opinions of hypothetical vignettes of abuse in heterosexual relationships. Their study found that abuse committed by women, including emotional and psychological abuse such as controlling or humiliating behavior, was typically viewed as less serious or detrimental than identical abuse committed by men. Additionally, Sorenson and Taylor found that respondents had a broader range of opinions about female perpetrators, representing a lack of clearly defined mores when compared to responses about male perpetrators.

When considering the emotional state of psychological abusers, psychologists have focused on aggression as a contributing factor. While it is typical for people to consider males to be the more aggressive of the two sexes, researchers have studied female aggression to help understand psychological abuse patterns in situations involving female abusers. According to Walsh and Shluman, &quot;The higher rates of female initiated aggression [including psychological aggression] may result, in part, from adolescents&#x27; attitudes about the unacceptability of male aggression and the relatively less negative attitudes toward female aggression&quot;. This concept that females are raised with fewer restrictions on aggressive behaviors (possibly due to the anxiety over aggression being focused on males) is a possible explanation for women who utilize aggression when being mentally abusive.

Some researchers have become interested in discovering exactly why women are usually not considered to be abusive. Hamel&#x27;s 2007 study found that a &quot;prevailing patriarchal conception of intimate partner violence&quot; led to a systematic reluctance to study women who psychologically and physically abuse their male partners. These findings state that existing cultural norms show males as more dominant and are therefore more likely to begin abusing their significant partners.

Dutton found that men who are emotionally or physically abused often encounter victim blaming that erroneously presumes the man either provoked or deserved the mistreatment by their female partners. Similarly, domestic violence victims will often blame their own behavior, rather than the violent actions of the abuser. Victims may try continually to alter their behavior and circumstances in order to please their abuser. Often, this results in further dependence of the individual on their abuser, as they may often change certain aspects of their lives that limit their resources. A 2002 study concluded that emotional abusers frequently aim to exercise total control of different aspects of family life. This behavior is only supported when the victim of the abuse aims to please their abuser.

Many abusers are able to control their victims in a manipulative manner, utilizing methods to persuade others to conform to the wishes of the abuser, rather than to force them to do something they do not wish to do. Simon argues that because aggression in abusive relationships can be carried out subtly and covertly through various manipulation and control tactics, victims often do not perceive the true nature of the relationship until conditions worsen considerably.

== Cultural causes ==
A researcher in 1988 said that wife abuse stems from &quot;normal psychological and behavioral patterns of most men ... feminists seek to understand why men, in general, use physical force against their partners and what functions this serves for a society in a given historical context&quot;. Dobash and Dobash (1979) said that &quot;Men who assault their wives are living up to cultural prescriptions that are cherished in Western society--aggressiveness, male dominance and female subordination--and they are using physical force as a means to enforce that dominance,&quot; while Walker claims that men exhibit a &quot;socialized androcentric need for power&quot;.

While some women are aggressive and dominating to male partners, a 2003 report concluded that the majority of abuse in heterosexual partnerships, at about 80% in the US, is perpetrated by men. (Critics stress that this Department of Justice study examines &quot;crime&quot; figures, and does not specifically address &quot;domestic abuse&quot; figures. While the categories of crime and domestic abuse may cross-over, many instances of domestic abuse are either not regarded as crimes or reported to police—critics thus argue that it is inaccurate to regard the DOJ study as a comprehensive statement on domestic abuse.) A 2002 study reports that ten percent of violence in the UK, overall, is by females against males. However, more recent data specifically regarding domestic abuse (including emotional abuse) report that 3 in 10 women, and 1 in 5 men, have experienced domestic abuse.

One source said that legal systems have in the past endorsed these traditions of male domination, and it is only in recent years that abusers have begun to be punished for their behavior. In 1879, a Harvard University law scholar wrote, &quot;The cases in the American courts are uniform against the right of the husband to use any chastisement, moderate or otherwise, toward the wife, for any purpose.&quot;

While recognizing that researchers have done valuable work and highlighted neglected topics critics suggest that the male cultural domination hypothesis for abuse is untenable as a generalized explanation for numerous reasons:
* A 1989 study concluded that many variables (racial, ethnic, cultural and subcultural, nationality, religion, family dynamics, and mental illness) make it very difficult or impossible to define male and female roles in any meaningful way that apply to the entire population.
* A 1995 study concluded that disagreements about power-sharing in relationships are more strongly associated with abuse than are imbalances of power.
* Peer-reviewed studies have produced inconsistent results when directly examining patriarchal beliefs and wife abuse. Yllo and Straus (1990) said that &quot;low status&quot; women in the United States suffered higher rates of spousal abuse; however, a rejoinder argued that Yllo and Straus&#x27;s interpretive conclusions were &quot;confusing and contradictory&quot;. Smith (1990) estimated that patriarchal beliefs were a causative factor for only 20% of wife abuse. Campbell (1993) writes that &quot;there is not a simple linear correlation between female status and rates of wife assault.&quot; Other studies had similar findings. Additionally, a 1994 study of Hispanic Americans revealed that traditionalist men exhibited lower rates of abuse towards women.
* Studies from the 1980s showed that treatment programs based on the patriarchal privilege model are flawed due to a weak connection between abusiveness and one&#x27;s cultural or social attitudes.
* A 1992 study challenge the concept that male abuse or control of women is culturally sanctioned, and concluded that abusive men are widely viewed as unsuitable partners for dating or marriage. A 1988 study concluded that a minority of abusive men qualify as pervasively misogynistic. A 1986 study concluded that the majority of men who commit spousal abuse agree that their behavior was inappropriate. A 1970 study concluded that a minority of men approve of spousal abuse under even limited circumstances. Studies from the 1970 and 1980s concluded that the majority of men are non-abusive towards girlfriends or wives for the duration of relationships, contrary to predictions that aggression or abuse towards women is an innate element of masculine culture.
* In 1994, a researcher said that the numerous studies establishing that heterosexual and gay male relationships have lower rates of abuse than lesbian relationships, and the fact that women who have been involved with both men and women were more likely to have been abused by a woman &quot;are difficult to explain in terms of male domination.&quot; Additionally, Dutton said that &quot;patriarchy must interact with psychological variables in order to account for the great variation in power-violence data. It is suggested that some forms of psychopathology lead to some men adopting patriarchal ideology to justify and rationalize their own pathology.&quot;

A 2010 study said that fundamentalist views of religions tend to reinforce emotional abuse, and that &quot;Gender inequity is usually translated into a power imbalance with women being more vulnerable. This vulnerability is more precarious in traditional patriarchal societies.&quot;

In the Book of Genesis God specifically punishes women after Adam and Eve disobey Him: &quot;in sorrow, thou shalt bring forth children: and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee&quot;; God also condemns Adam to a lifetime of work, for the sin of listening to his wife.

Some studies say that fundamentalist religious prohibitions against divorce may make it more difficult for religious men or women to leave an abusive marriage. A 1985 survey of Protestant clergy in the United States by Jim M Alsdurf found that 21% of them agreed that &quot;no amount of abuse would justify a woman&#x27;s leaving her husband, ever&quot;, and 26% agreed with the statement that &quot;a wife should submit to her husband and trust that God would honor her action by either stopping the abuse or giving her the strength to endure it.&quot; A 2016 report by the Muslim Women&#x27;s Network UK cited several barriers for Muslim women in abusive marriages who seek divorce through Sharia Council services. These barriers include: selectively quoting religious text to discourage divorce; blaming the woman for the failed marriage; placing greater weight on the husband&#x27;s testimony; requiring the woman to present two male witnesses; and pressuring women into mediation or reconciliation rather than granting a divorce, even when domestic violence is present.

In today&#x27;s world, various forms of abuse are increasingly being recognized in all parts of the world. The level of awareness regarding abuse varies from one country to another. Both victims and perpetrators around the world are being acknowledged more readily compared to past eras.

<doc id="526629" wikidata="Q1103446" url="?curid=526629" title="Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock">
<text>William John Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock, (8 December 1907 – 14 October 1985) was a British barrister and judge who served as a lord of appeal in ordinary between 1968 and until his death in 1985. Appointed to the English High Court in 1956 and the Court of Appeal five years later, Diplock made important contributions to the development of constitutional and public law as well as many other legal fields. A frequent choice for governmental inquiries, he is also remembered for proposing the creation of the eponymous juryless Diplock courts. Of him, Lord Rawlinson of Ewell wrote that &quot;to his generation Diplock was the quintessential man of the law&quot;.

==Early life and legal career==
Kenneth Diplock was born in South Croydon, the son of solicitor William John Hubert Diplock and his wife Christine Joan Brooke. He was educated at Whitgift School in Croydon and University College, Oxford, where he read chemistry and graduated with a second-class degree in 1929. He was Secretary of the Oxford Union for a term in 1929. He later become an honorary fellow of University College in 1958.

Diplock was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1932. After two years in the chambers of Sir Valentine Holmes, KC, he transferred to the chambers of Sir Leslie Scott, KC. In 1939, he left legal practice for serve in the Second World War; in 1941, he joined the Royal Air Force, in which he reached the rank of squadron leader. From 1939 to 1948, he was secretary to the Master of the Rolls, Lord Greene. 

Returning to the bar in 1945, Diplock was made a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1948, at the early age of 41. He acquired a large practice in commercial work and in advisory work for Commonwealth governments. He was Recorder of Oxford from 1951 to 1956, and served on the Law Reform Committee.

== Judicial career ==
In 1956, Diplock was appointed to the High Court of Justice, receiving the customary knighthood. Assigned to the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division, he was appointed President of the Restrictive Practices Court in January 1961. He was promoted to be a Lord Justice of Appeal in October 1961, and was sworn of the Privy Council. He was chairman of the Security Commission from 1971 to 1982.

He became a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary on 30 September 1968 and was elevated as a life peer with the title Baron Diplock, &quot;of Wansford in the County of Huntingdon and Peterborough&quot; to the House of Lords.

He became the senior Law Lord upon the retirement of Lord Wilberforce in 1982. He resigned his seniority in October 1984 but remained a Law Lord until his death the following year. 

As Lord Diplock, he chaired a commission set up in 1972 to consider legal measures against terrorism in Northern Ireland, which led to the establishment of the juryless Diplock courts with which his name is now often associated.

In September 1985, Lord Diplock sat as a judge for the last time, in a special sitting of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council during the Long Vacation for an urgent civil case from Trinidad and Tobago. Severely ill from emphysema, Diplock came to court from the hospital in a wheelchair and with an oxygen cylinder.

At the time of his death, Lord Diplock was the longest serving law lord as well as the last serving superior judge to not be covered the mandatory retirement age of 75 introduced by the Judicial Pensions Act 1959.

== Personal life ==
He married Margaret Sarah Atcheson in 1938; they had no children.

==Contributions to legal thought==
He made many contributions to legal thought and pushed the law in new and unique directions, not least UK courts without juries (&#x27;Diplock courts)&#x27;. His rulings, especially those on administrative law, are often considered as authoritative not only in England but across the Commonwealth and even in the United States, where he has been cited by the Supreme Court.

Examples include &quot;Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service&quot; [1984] UKHL 9 or &quot;R (National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd) v Inland Revenue Commissioners&quot; [1982] AC 617, on grounds of review and locus standi respectively.

He also made important contributions to contract law.

The current typology of grounds for judicial review is owing to Lord Diplock.

*&quot;Audi alteram partem&quot; (Hearing rule)

*Extended &quot;ultra vires&quot;

<text>A whoopee cushion (also spelled whoopey cushion or whoopie cushion) is a practical joke device, which emulates the sound of flatulence.

==History and modern usage==
The whoopee cushion has reportedly been used since ancient times. Roman Emperor Elagabalus was said to enjoy practical jokes at his dinner parties and often placed whoopee cushions under the chairs of his more pompous guests. The 10th-century Aghlabid emir of Ifriqiya, Ziyadat Allah III, is said to have enjoyed hiding inflated animal bladders under the cushions of his palace for unsuspecting guests to sit on.

The modern rubber whoopee cushion was invented in the 1930s by the JEM Rubber Co. of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, by employees who were experimenting with scrap sheets of rubber. The company&#x27;s owner approached Samuel Sorenson Adams, inventor of numerous practical jokes and owner of S.S. Adams Co., with the newly invented item; however, Adams thought that it was &quot;too vulgar&quot; and would never sell. JEM then offered the idea to the Johnson Smith Company, which sold it with great success. Adams later released its own version, calling it the Razzberry Cushion.

==Design==

The device is made from two sheets of rubber, adhered at their perimeter, with a small flap opening at one end for air to enter and exit. Whoopee cushions lack durability and can break easily, lasting longest when they are not inflated or sat on with excessive force.

==Use==

Whoopee cushions are inflated by blowing into the flapped opening. &quot;Self-inflating&quot; cushions have an interior sponge that keeps them in a normally expanded state, and do not require inflation. 

The cushion is then placed under a seat cushion or other material, for someone unsuspecting to sit on — forcing the air out, causing the flap to vibrate and creating a flatulent sound. 

If the act of sitting happens to block the air flow, the cushion can rupture -- thus requiring some attention in placement of the cushion. Alternatively, the cushion can be inflated and intentionally operated by hand to produce the noise.

A flatulent noise can be made by inflating a toy balloon, then releasing the opening and letting it deflate. The escaping air causes the opening to vibrate and make noise as the balloon is propelled away.

In other words, they assume that their personal qualities, characteristics, beliefs, and actions are relatively widespread through the general population.

This false consensus is significant because it increases self-esteem (overconfidence effect). It can be derived from a desire to conform and be liked by others in a social environment. This bias is especially prevalent in group settings where one thinks the collective opinion of their own group matches that of the larger population. Since the members of a group reach a consensus and rarely encounter those who dispute it, they tend to believe that everybody thinks the same way. The false-consensus effect is not restricted to cases where people believe that their values are shared by the majority, but it still manifests as an overestimate of the extent of their belief.

Additionally, when confronted with evidence that a consensus does not exist, people often assume that those who do not agree with them are defective in some way. There is no single cause for this cognitive bias; the availability heuristic, self-serving bias, and naïve realism have been suggested as at least partial underlying factors. The bias may also result, at least in part, from non-social stimulus-reward associations. Maintenance of this cognitive bias may be related to the tendency to make decisions with relatively little information. When faced with uncertainty and a limited sample from which to make decisions, people often &quot;project&quot; themselves onto the situation. When this personal knowledge is used as input to make generalizations, it often results in the false sense of being part of the majority.

The false consensus effect has been widely observed and supported by empirical evidence. Previous research has suggested that cognitive and perceptional factors (motivated projection, accessibility of information, emotion, etc.) may contribute to the consensus bias, while recent studies have focused on its neural mechanisms. One recent study has shown that consensus bias may improve decisions about other people&#x27;s preferences. Ross, Green and House first defined the false consensus effect in 1977 with emphasis on the relative commonness that people perceive about their own responses; however, similar projection phenomena had already caught attention in psychology. Specifically, concerns with respect to connections between individual&#x27;s personal predispositions and their estimates of peers appeared in the literature for a while. For instances, Katz and Allport in 1931 illustrated that students’ estimates of the amount of others on the frequency of cheating was positively correlated to their own behavior. Later, around 1970, same phenomena were found on political beliefs and prisoner&#x27;s dilemma situation. In 2017, researchers identified a persistent egocentric bias when participants learned about other people&#x27;s snack-food preferences. Moreover, recent studies suggest that the false consensus effect can also affect professional decision makers; specifically, it has been shown that even experienced marketing managers project their personal product preferences onto consumers.

== Major theoretical approaches ==
The false-consensus effect can be traced back to two parallel theories of social perception, &quot;the study of how we form impressions of and make inferences about other people&quot;. The first is the idea of social comparison. The principal claim of Leon Festinger&#x27;s (1954) social comparison theory was that individuals evaluate their thoughts and attitudes based on other people. This may be motivated by a desire for confirmation and the need to feel good about oneself. As an extension of this theory, people may use others as sources of information to define social reality and guide behavior. This is called informational social influence. The problem, though, is that people are often unable to accurately perceive the social norm and the actual attitudes of others. In other words, research has shown that people are surprisingly poor &quot;intuitive psychologists&quot; and that our social judgments are often inaccurate. This finding helped to lay the groundwork for an understanding of biased processing and inaccurate social perception. The false-consensus effect is just one example of such an inaccuracy.

The second influential theory is projection, the idea that people project their own attitudes and beliefs onto others. This idea of projection is not a new concept. In fact, it can be found in Sigmund Freud&#x27;s work on the defense mechanism of projection, D.S. Holmes&#x27; work on &quot;attributive projection&quot; (1968), and Gustav Ichheisser&#x27;s work on social perception (1970). D.S. Holmes, for example, described social projection as the process by which people &quot;attempt to validate their beliefs by projecting their own characteristics onto other individuals&quot;.

Here a connection can be made between the two stated theories of social comparison and projection. First, as social comparison theory explains, individuals constantly look to peers as a reference group and are motivated to do so in order to seek confirmation for their own attitudes and beliefs.

The false-consensus effect, as defined by Ross, Greene, and House in 1977, came to be the culmination of the many related theories that preceded it. In their well-known series of four studies, Ross and associates hypothesized and then demonstrated that people tend to overestimate the popularity of their own beliefs and preferences. Studies were both conducted in hypothetical situations by questionnaire surveys and in authentic conflict situations. For questionnaire studies, participants were presented with hypothetical events and then were not only asked to indicate their own behavioral choices and characteristics under the provided circumstances, but also asked to rate the responses and traits of their peers who referred as &quot;actors&quot;. As for real occasion studies, participants were actually confronted with the conflict situations in which they were asked to choose behavioral alternatives and to judge the traits as well as decisions of two supposedly true individuals who had attended in the study. In general, the raters made more &quot;extreme predictions&quot; about the personalities of the actors that did not share the raters&#x27; own preference. In fact, the raters may have even thought that there was something wrong with the people expressing the alternative response.

In the ten years after the influential Ross et al. study, close to 50 papers were published with data on the false-consensus effect. Theoretical approaches were also expanded. The theoretical perspectives of this era can be divided into four categories: (a) selective exposure and cognitive availability, (b) salience and focus of attention, (c) logical information processing, and (d) motivational processes. In general, the researchers and designers of these theories believe that there is not a single right answer. Instead, they admit that there is overlap among the theories and that the false-consensus effect is most likely due to a combination of these factors.

===Selective exposure and cognitive availability===
This theory is closely tied to the availability heuristic, which suggests that perceptions of similarity (or difference) are affected by how easily those characteristics can be recalled from memory. And as one might expect, similarities between oneself and others are more easily recalled than differences. This is in part because people usually associate with those who are similar to themselves. This selected exposure to similar people may bias or restrict the &quot;sample of information about the true diversity of opinion in the larger social environment&quot;. As a result of the selective exposure and availability heuristic, it is natural for the similarities to prevail in one&#x27;s thoughts.

 did a popular study on the effects of the false-consensus effect among a specific adolescent community in an effort to determine whether students show a higher level of false-consensus effect among their direct peers as opposed to society at large. The participants of this experiment were 203 college students ranging in age from 18 to 25 (with an average age of 18.5). The participants were given a questionnaire and asked to answer questions regarding a variety of social topics. For each social topic, they were asked to answer how they felt about the topic and to estimate the percentage of their peers who would agree with them. The results determined that the false-consensus effect was extremely prevalent when participants were describing the rest of their college community; out of twenty topics considered, sixteen of them prominently demonstrated the false-consensus effect. The high levels of false-consensus effect seen in this study can be attributed to the group studied; because the participants were asked to compare themselves to a group of peers that they are constantly around (and view as very similar to themselves), the levels of false-consensus effect increased.

===Salience and focus of attention===
This theory suggests that when an individual focuses solely on their own preferred position, they are more likely to overestimate its popularity, thus falling victim to the false-consensus effect. This is because that position is the only one in their immediate consciousness. Performing an action that promotes the position will make it more salient and may increase the false-consensus effect. If, however, more positions are presented to the individual, the degree of the false-consensus effect might decrease significantly.

===Logical information processing===
This theory assumes that active and seemingly rational thinking underlies an individual&#x27;s estimates of similarity among others. 
In a study done by Fox, Yinon, and Mayraz, researchers were attempting to determine whether or not the levels of the false-consensus effect changed in different age groups. In order to come to a conclusion, it was necessary for the researchers to split their participants into four different age groups. Two hundred participants were used, and gender was not considered to be a factor. Just as in the previous study mentioned, this study used a questionnaire as its main source of information. The results showed that the false-consensus effect was extremely prevalent in all groups, but was the most prevalent in the oldest age group (the participants who were labeled as &quot;old-age home residents&quot;). They showed the false-consensus effect in all 12 areas that they were questioned about. The increase in false-consensus effect seen in the oldest age group can be accredited to their high level of &quot;logical&quot; reasoning behind their decisions; the oldest age group has obviously lived the longest, and therefore feels that they can project their beliefs onto all age groups due to their (seemingly objective) past experiences and wisdom. The younger age groups cannot logically relate to those older to them because they have not had that experience and do not pretend to know these objective truths. These results demonstrate a tendency for older people to rely more heavily on situational attributions (life experience) as opposed to internal attributions.

===Motivational processes===
This theory stresses the benefits of the false-consensus effect: namely, the perception of increased social validation, social support, and self-esteem. It may also be useful to exaggerate similarities in social situations in order to increase liking.

== Belief in a favorable future ==
The concept of false consensus effect can also be extended to predictions about future others. Belief in a favorable future is the belief that future others will change their preferences and beliefs in alignment with one&#x27;s own.

Rogers, Moore, and Norton (2017) find that belief in a favorable future is greater in magnitude than the false-consensus effect for two reasons: 
# It is based in future others whose beliefs are not directly observable, and
# It is focused on future beliefs, which gives these future others time to &quot;discover&quot; the truth and change their beliefs.

<text>A silver medal, in sports and other similar areas involving competition, is a medal made of, or plated with, silver awarded to the second-place finisher, or runner-up, of contests or competitions such as the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, etc. The outright winner receives a gold medal and the third place a bronze medal. More generally, silver is traditionally a metal sometimes used for all types of high-quality medals, including artistic ones.

== Sports ==
=== Olympic Games ===

During the first Olympic event in 1896, number one achievers or winners&#x27; medals were in fact made of silver metal. The custom of gold-silver-bronze for the first three places dates from the 1904 games and has been copied for many other sporting events. Minting the medals is the responsibility of the host city. From 1928 to 1968 the design was always the same: the obverse showed a generic design by Florentine artist Giuseppe Cassioli with text giving the host city; the reverse showed another generic design of an Olympic champion. From 1972–2000, Cassioli&#x27;s design (or a slight reworking) remained on the obverse with a custom design by the host city on the reverse. Noting that Cassioli&#x27;s design showed a Roman amphitheatre for what was originally a Greek games, a new obverse design was commissioned for the Athens Games. Winter Olympics medals have been of more varied design.

=== The Open Championship ===
In The Open Championship golf tournament, the Silver Medal is an award presented to the lowest scoring amateur player at the tournament.

=== Rejection of silver medals ===
In many sports with an elimination tournament, including those with a third place playoff (such as Olympic ice hockey, Olympic soccer, FIFA World Cup), silver is the only medal given to a team that loses its final game, whereas gold and bronze are earned by teams winning their final matches. Notable athletes such as Jocelyne Larocque (2018 Olympics) removed their runners-up/silver medals right after receiving them; Larocque was later ordered by the International Ice Hockey Federation official to put her silver medal back on.

== Military and government ==

Some countries present military and civilian decorations known as Silver Medals. These include:

* Austria′s Silver Medal for Services to the Republic of Austria
* Italy′s Silver Medal of Military Valor
* South Africa′s Silver Medal for Merit
* The Civil Air Patrol′s Silver Medal of Valor in the United States.

== Other awards ==

The Zoological Society of London awards a Silver Medal &quot;to a Fellow of the Society or any other person for contributions to the understanding and appreciation of zoology, including such activities as public education in natural history, and wildlife conservation.&quot;

The Royal Academy of Engineering awards a Silver Medal &quot;for an outstanding and demonstrated personal contribution to UK engineering, which results in successful market exploitation, by an engineer with less than 22 years in full-time employment or equivalent.&quot;

<doc id="526648" wikidata="Q873364" url="?curid=526648" title="Bronze medal">
<text>A bronze medal in sports and other similar areas involving competition is a medal made of bronze awarded to the third-place finisher of contests or competitions such as the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, etc. The outright winner receives a gold medal and the second place a silver medal. More generally, bronze is traditionally the most common metal used for all types of high-quality medals, including artistic ones. The practice of awarding bronze third place medals in the Olympic Games began at the 1904 Olympic Games in St. Louis, Missouri, before which only first and second places were awarded.

==Olympic Games==

Minting Olympic medals is the responsibility of the host city. From 1928–1968 the design was always the same: the obverse showed a generic design by Florentine artist Giuseppe Cassioli with text giving the host city; the reverse showed another generic design of an Olympic champion. From 1972–2000, Cassioli&#x27;s design (or a slight reworking) remained on the obverse with a custom design by the host city on the reverse. Noting that Cassioli&#x27;s design showed a Roman amphitheatre for what was originally a Greek game, a new obverse design was commissioned for the Athens 2004 Games. Winter Olympics medals have been of more varied design.

In a few tournament sports, such as boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling, two bronze medals are awarded in each event – one for each eliminated semi-finalist or for the winners of the &quot;repechage&quot; brackets.

==Psychological study==
In 1995, a study was carried out by social psychologists Victoria Medvec, Scott Madey and Thomas Gilovich on the effects of counterfactual thinking on the Olympics. The study showed that athletes who won the bronze medal were significantly happier with their winning than those athletes who won the silver medal. The silver medalists were more frustrated because they had missed the gold medal, while the bronze medalists were simply happy to have received any honors at all (instead of no medal for fourth place). This is more pronounced in knockout competitions, where the bronze medals are achieved by winning a third place playoff, whereas silver medals are awarded after a defeat in the final. This psychological phenomenon was parodied in the Jerry Seinfeld special &quot;I&#x27;m Telling You for the Last Time&quot;.

<doc id="526652" wikidata="Q284637" url="?curid=526652" title="List of marquessates in the peerages of Britain and Ireland">
<text>This article lists all marquessates, extant, extinct, dormant, abeyant, or forfeit, in the peerages of England, Scotland, Great Britain, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.

The title of Marquess of Dublin, which is perhaps best described as Anglo-Irish, was the first to be created, in 1385, but like the next few creations, the title was soon forfeit. The title of Marquess of Pembroke, created in 1532 by Henry VIII for Anne Boleyn, has the distinction of being the first English hereditary peerage granted to a woman in her own right (styled &quot;Marchioness&quot; in the patent). The English title Marquess of Winchester, created in 1551, is the earliest still extant, so is Premier Marquess of England. The title long remained less common, and on the evening of the Coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838, the Prime Minister Lord Melbourne explained to her (from her journals): 
&quot;I spoke to Ld M. about the numbers of Peers present at the Coronation, &amp; he said it was quite unprecedented. I observed that there were very few Viscounts, to which he replied &quot;There are very few Viscounts,&quot; that they were an old sort of title &amp; not really English; that they came from Vice-Comites; that Dukes &amp; Barons were the only real English titles; — that Marquises were likewise not English, &amp; that people were mere made Marquises, when it was not wished that they should be made Dukes&quot;.

<text>The chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the presiding member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which collectively serves as head of state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Željka Cvijanović is the incumbent officeholder, having served since 16 November 2024.

==Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina==
According to the Article V of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Presidency comprises three members, representing the constituent nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina: one Bosniak, one Serb, and one Croat. The Bosniak and Croat members are elected from a joint constituency in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, whilst the Serb member is elected from voters in Republika Srpska.

The three members elected at any one election serve a collective four-year term. Individuals are able to serve no more than two consecutive four-year terms, although there are no overall term limits.

Although the unsubdivided body is the collective head of state, one member is designated as Chairperson. The position of Chairperson rotates twice around the three members every eight months, with the candidate receiving the most votes overall becoming the first Chairperson over the four-year term.

<doc id="526659" wikidata="Q1129111" url="?curid=526659" title="Philadelphia chromosome">
<text>The Philadelphia chromosome or Philadelphia translocation (Ph) is a specific genetic abnormality in chromosome 22 of leukemia cancer cells (particularly chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells). This chromosome is defective and unusually short because of reciprocal translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11), of genetic material between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22, and contains a fusion gene called &quot;BCR-ABL1&quot;. This gene is the &quot;ABL1&quot; gene of chromosome 9 juxtaposed onto the breakpoint cluster region &quot;BCR&quot; gene of chromosome 22, coding for a hybrid protein: a tyrosine kinase signaling protein that is &quot;always on&quot;, causing the cell to divide uncontrollably by interrupting the stability of the genome and impairing various signaling pathways governing the cell cycle.

The presence of this translocation is required for diagnosis of CML; in other words, all cases of CML are positive for &quot;BCR-ABL1&quot;. (Some cases are confounded by either a cryptic translocation that is invisible on G-banded chromosome preparations, or a variant translocation involving another chromosome or chromosomes as well as the long arm of chromosomes 9 and 22. Other similar but truly Ph-negative conditions are considered CML-like myeloproliferative neoplasms.) However, the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is not sufficiently specific to diagnose CML, since it is also found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (aka ALL, 25–30% of adult cases and 2–10% of pediatric cases) and occasionally in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) as well as mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL).

==Molecular biology==

The chromosomal defect in the Philadelphia chromosome is a reciprocal translocation, in which parts of two chromosomes, 9 and 22, swap places. The result is that a fusion gene is created by juxtaposing the &quot;ABL1&quot; gene on chromosome 9 (region q34) to a part of the &quot;BCR&quot; (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22 (region q11). This is a reciprocal translocation, creating an elongated chromosome 9 (termed a derivative chromosome, or &quot;der 9&quot;), and a truncated chromosome 22 (&quot;the Philadelphia chromosome, 22q-).&quot; In agreement with the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN), this chromosomal translocation is designated as t(9;22)(q34;q11). The symbol &quot;ABL1&quot; is derived from Abelson, the name of a leukemia virus which carries a similar protein. The symbol BCR is derived from breakpoint cluster region, a gene which encodes a protein that acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho GTPase proteins.

Translocation results in an oncogenic &quot;BCR-ABL1&quot; gene fusion that can be found on the shorter derivative chromosome 22. This gene encodes for a BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. Depending on the precise location of fusion, the molecular weight of this protein can range from 185 to 210 kDa. Consequently, the hybrid BCR-ABL1 fusion protein is referred to as p210 or p185.

Three clinically important variants encoded by the fusion gene are the p190, p210, and p230 isoforms. p190 is generally associated with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), while p210 is generally associated with chronic myeloid leukemia but can also be associated with ALL and AML. p230 is usually associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia associated with neutrophilia and thrombocytosis (CML-N). Additionally, the p190 isoform can also be expressed as a splice variant of p210.

The ABL1 gene expresses a membrane-associated protein, a tyrosine kinase, and the &quot;BCR-ABL1&quot; transcript is also translated into a tyrosine kinase containing domains from both the &quot;BCR&quot; and &quot;ABL1&quot; genes. The activity of tyrosine kinases is typically regulated in an auto-inhibitory fashion, but the &quot;BCR-ABL1&quot; fusion gene codes for a protein that is &quot;always on&quot; or constitutively activated, leading to impaired DNA binding and unregulated cell division (i.e. cancer). This is due to the replacement of the myristoylated cap region, which when present induces a conformational change rendering the kinase domain inactive, with a truncated portion of the BCR protein. Although the BCR region also expresses serine/threonine kinases, the tyrosine kinase function is very relevant for drug therapy. As the N-terminal Y177 and CC domains from BCR encode the constitutive activation of the ABL1 kinase, these regions are targeted in therapies to downregulate BCR-ABL1 kinase activity. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors specific to such domains as CC, Y177, and Rho (such as imatinib and sunitinib) are important drugs against a variety of cancers including CML, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).

The fused BCR-ABL1 protein interacts with the interleukin-3 receptor beta(c) subunit and is moderated by an activation loop within its SH1 domain, which is turned &quot;on&quot; when bound to ATP and triggers downstream pathways. The ABL1 tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL1 is elevated relative to wild-type ABL1. Since ABL activates a number of cell cycle-controlling proteins and enzymes, the result of the BCR-ABL1 fusion is to speed up cell division. Moreover, it inhibits DNA repair, causing genomic instability and potentially causing the feared blast crisis in CML.

== Proliferative roles in leukemia ==
The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene and protein encoded by the Philadelphia chromosome affects multiple signaling pathways that directly affect apoptotic potential, cell division rates, and different stages of the cell cycle to achieve unchecked proliferation characteristic of CML and ALL.

===JAK/STAT pathway===
Particularly vital to the survival and proliferation of myelogenous leukemia cells in the microenvironment of the bone marrow is cytokine and growth factor signaling. The JAK/STAT pathway moderates many of these effectors by activating STATs, which are transcription factors with the ability to modulate cytokine receptors and growth factors. JAK2 phosphorylates the BCR-ABL fusion protein at Y177 and stabilizes the fusion protein, strengthening tumorigenic cell signaling. JAK2 mutations have been shown to be central to myeloproliferative neoplasms and JAK kinases play a central role in driving hematologic malignancies (JAK blood journal). ALL and CML therapies have targeted JAK2 as well as BCR-ABL using nilotinib and ruxolitinib within murine models to downregulate downstream cytokine signaling by silencing STAT3 and STAT5 transcription activation (appelmann et al.). The interaction between JAK2 and BCR-ABL within these hematopoietic malignancies implies an important role of JAK-STAT-mediated cytokine signaling in promoting the growth of leukemic cells exhibiting the Ph chromosome and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity. Though the centrality of the JAK2 pathway to direct proliferation in CML has been debated, its role as a downstream effector of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase has been maintained. Impacts on the cell cycle via JAK-STAT are largely peripheral, but by directly impacting the maintenance of the hematopoietic niche and its surrounding microenvironment, the BCR-ABL upregulation of JAK-STAT signaling plays an important role in maintaining leukemic cell growth and division.

===Ras/MAPK/ERK pathway===
The Ras/MAPK/ERK pathway relays signals to nuclear transcription factors and plays a role in governing cell cycle control and differentiation. In Ph chromosome-containing cells, the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activates the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, which results in unregulated cell proliferation via gene transcription in the nucleus. The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activates Ras via phosphorylation of the GAB2 protein, which is dependent on BCR-located phosphorylation of Y177. Ras in particular is shown to be an important downstream target of BCR-ABL1 in CML, as Ras mutants in murine models disrupt the development of CML associated with the BCR-ABL1 gene (Effect of Ras inhibition in hematopoiesis and BCR/ABL leukemogenesis). The Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is also implicated in overexpression of osteopontin (OPN), which is important for maintenance of the hematopoietic stem cell niche, which indirectly influences unchecked proliferation characteristic of leukemic cells. BCR-ABL fusion cells also exhibit constitutively high levels of activated Ras bound to GTP, activating a Ras-dependent signaling pathway which has been shown to inhibit apoptosis downstream of BCR-ABL (Cortez et al.). Interactions with the IL-3 receptor also induce the Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway to phosphorylate transcription factors which play a role in driving the G1/S transition of the cell cycle.

===DNA binding and apoptosis===
The c-Abl gene in wild-type cells is implicated in DNA binding, which affects such processes as DNA transcription, repair, apoptosis, and other processes underlying the cell cycle. While the nature of this interaction has been debated, evidence exists to suggest that c-Abl phosphorylates HIPK2, a serine/threonine kinase, in response to DNA damage and promotes apoptosis in normal cells. The BCR-ABL fusion, in contrast, has been shown to inhibit apoptosis, but its effect on DNA binding in particular is unclear.
In apoptotic inhibition, BCR-ABL cells have been shown to be resistant to drug-induced apoptosis but also have a proapoptotic expression profile by increased expression levels of p53, p21, and Bax. The function of these pro-apoptotic proteins, however, is impaired, and apoptosis is not carried out in these cells. BCR-ABL has also been implicated in preventing caspase 9 and caspase 3 processing, which adds to the inhibitory effect. Another factor preventing cell cycle progression and apoptosis is the deletion of the IKAROS gene, which presents in &gt;80% of Ph chromosome–positive ALL cases. The IKAROS gene is critical to pre-B cell receptor–mediated cell cycle arrest in ALL cells positive for Ph, which when impaired provides a mechanism for unchecked cell cycle progression and proliferation of defective cells as encouraged by BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase signaling.

== Nomenclature ==
The Philadelphia chromosome is designated Ph (or Ph&#x27;) chromosome and designates the shortened chromosome 22 which encodes the BCR-ABL fusion gene/protein kinase. It arises from the translocation, which is termed t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2), between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22, with breaks happening in region (3), band (4), sub-band (1) of the long arm (q) of chromosome 9 and region (1), band (1), sub-band (2) of the long arm (q) of chromosome 22. Hence the chromosome breakpoints are written as (9q34.1) and (22q11.2), respectively, using ISCN standards.

==Therapy==

===Tyrosine kinase inhibitors===
In the late 1990s, STI-571 (imatinib, Gleevec/Glivec) was identified by the pharmaceutical company Novartis (then known as Ciba Geigy) in high-throughput screens for tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Subsequent clinical trials led by Dr. Brian J. Druker at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in collaboration with Dr. Charles Sawyers and Dr. Moshe Talpaz demonstrated that STI-571 inhibits proliferation of BCR-ABL-expressing hematopoietic cells. Although it did not eradicate CML cells, it did greatly limit the growth of the tumor clone and decreased the risk of the feared &quot;blast crisis&quot;.
In 2000 Dr. John Kuriyan determined the mechanism by which STI-571 inhibits the Abl kinase domain.
It was marketed in 2001 by Novartis as imatinib mesylate (Gleevec in the US, Glivec in Europe).

Other pharmacological inhibitors are being developed, which are more potent and/or are active against the emerging Gleevec/Glivec resistant BCR-abl clones in treated patients. The majority of these resistant clones are point-mutations in the kinase of BCR-abl. New inhibitors include dasatinib and nilotinib, which are significantly more potent than imatinib and may overcome resistance. Combination therapies with nilotinib and ruxolitnib have also shown success in suppressing resistance by targeting the JAK-STAT and BCR-ABL stages simultaneously. Small molecule inhibitors, like arsenic trioxide and geldanamycin analogues, have also been identified in downregulating BCR-ABL kinase translation and promoting its degradation by protease.

Axitinib, a drug used to treat renal cell carcinoma, has been shown to be effective at inhibiting the Abl kinase activity in patients with BCR-ABL1(T315I). The T315I mutation in the fusion gene confers resistance to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, however axitinib has been successfully been used to treat a patient with ALL carrying this mutation, as well as CML cells in culture.

Treatment of pediatric Ph+ ALL with a combination of standard chemotherapy and RTK inhibitors may result in remission, but the curative potential is unknown.

Asciminib (Scemblix) was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2021.

===Blood or marrow transplants===
A potentially curative, but risky, option for pediatric Ph+ ALL or Ph+ CML is bone marrow transplant or cord blood transplant, but chemotherapy is favored by some for achieving first remission (CR1). For some, bone marrow transplant from a matched sibling donor or a matched, unrelated donor may be favored when remission is obtained.

Cord blood transplant is favored by some when a 10/10 bone marrow match is not available, and cord blood transplant may have some advantages, including a reduced incidence of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), which is a common and significant complication of transplant. However, transplant with cord blood sometimes requires longer periods of time for engraftment, which may increase the potential for complications due to infection. Regardless of the type of transplant, transplant-related mortality and relapse are possible, and the rates may change as treatment protocols improve. For second remission (CR2), if achieved, both chemotherapy and transplant options are possible, and many physicians prefer transplant.

==Prognosis==
BCR-ABL positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has a 5-year survival rate ranging from 50% to 75%, in studies of the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

==History==
The Philadelphia chromosome was first discovered and described in 1959 by David Hungerford at the Lankenau Hospital&#x27;s Institute for Cancer Research, which merged with the American Oncology Hospital in 1974 to create Fox Chase Cancer Center, along with Peter Nowell from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. The genetic abnormality Hungerford and Nowell found was named after the city in which both organizations were located. And thus, this is a typical example of a medical toponym.

Hungerford was writing his doctoral thesis on chromosomes in a genetics lab at what was then the Institute for Cancer Research at the Lankenau Hospital Research Institute, and detected a flaw in chromosomes from the blood cells of patients with leukemia. This founding observation was the first genetic defect to be linked with a specific human cancer. Nowell was a pathologist at the University of Pennsylvania who was also studying leukemia cells under the microscope when he noticed cells with this genetic flaw in the act of dividing. To his surprise, their chromosomes—usually an indistinct tangle—were visible as separate structures. In searching for an expert on chromosomes, Nowell found Hungerford locally at Lankenau. While conducting his microscopic studies, Hungerford furthered his observations with the discovery that certain leukemia cells had an abnormally short chromosome 22. Subsequently, the mutation he observed became known as the Philadelphia chromosome.

In 1973, Janet Rowley at the University of Chicago identified the mechanism by which the Philadelphia chromosome arises as a translocation.

<doc id="526663" wikidata="Q4808727" url="?curid=526663" title="Živko Radišić">
<text>Živko Radišić (, ; 15 August 1937 – 5 September 2021) was a Bosnian Serb politician who served as the 2nd Serb member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1998 to 2002.

Radišić previously served as mayor of Banja Luka from 1977 to 1982. He was a founding member and president of the Socialist Party.

==Career==
Born in Prijedor, Kingdom of Yugoslavia, present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, on 15 August 1937, Radišić graduated in 1964 from the University of Sarajevo Faculty of Political Science. During the 1969 Banja Luka earthquake, he was a high ranking Banja Luka city government official, and thus, was directly in charge of repairing the consequences from the earthquake.

Later on, from 1977 until 1982, Radišić served as mayor of Banja Luka. From 1982 to 1985, he headed the defence ministry of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1993, Radišić became a founding member of the Socialist Party. In 1996, alongside Milorad Dodik, he formed the People&#x27;s Alliance for Free Peace for the 1996 general election.

Radišić was elected Serb member of the Bosnian Presidency in the 1998 general election, defeating the incumbent Momčilo Krajišnik by 45,000 votes. He chaired the Presidency from 1998 until 1999 and again from 2000 until 2001. Radišić decided not to run for a second term in the Presidency in the 2002 general election. His term ended on 28 October 2002, and was succeeded as the Serb member by Mirko Šarović.

==Personal life==
Živko was married to Draginja Radišić and spent most of their life living in Banja Luka.

He died on 5 September 2021, aged 84, in a Banja Luka hospital.

<doc id="526664" wikidata="Q1573307" url="?curid=526664" title="Wernicke encephalopathy">
<text>Wernicke encephalopathy (WE), also Wernicke&#x27;s encephalopathy, or wet brain is the presence of neurological symptoms caused by biochemical lesions of the central nervous system after exhaustion of B-vitamin reserves, in particular thiamine (vitamin B1). The condition is part of a larger group of thiamine deficiency disorders that includes beriberi, in all its forms, and alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome. When it occurs simultaneously with alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome it is known as Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome.

Classically, Wernicke encephalopathy is characterised by a triad of symptoms: ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion. Around 10% of patients exhibit all three features, and other symptoms may also be present. While it is commonly regarded as a condition particular to malnourished people with alcohol misuse, it can be caused by a variety of diseases.
It is treated with thiamine supplementation, which can lead to improvement of the symptoms and often complete resolution, particularly in those where alcohol misuse is not the underlying cause. Often other nutrients also need to be replaced, depending on the cause. Medical literature notes how managing the condition in a timely fashion can avoid worsening symptoms.

Wernicke encephalopathy may be present in the general population with a prevalence of around 2%, and is considered underdiagnosed; probably, many cases are in patients who do not have commonly-associated symptoms.

==Signs and symptoms==
The classic triad of symptoms found in Wernicke encephalopathy is:
* Ophthalmoplegia: later expanded to include other eye movement disorders; typically affecting the lateral rectus muscle. Lateral nystagmus is the most commonly seen disorder, but lateral rectus palsy—usually bilateral—is common, as well. 
* Ataxia: later expanded to include imbalance or any cerebellar dysfunction.
* Confusion: later expanded to include any neuropsychological disturbances. Prevalent in roughly eight in 10 diagnosed cases.

Other possible symptoms include:
* Pupillary changes, Retinal haemorrhage, papilledema, and impaired vision and hearing.
* Fatiguability, apathy, irritability, drowsiness, psychological slowing and/or motor slowing.
* Dysphagia, blushing, sleep apnea, epilepsy and stupor.
* Lactic acidosis.
* Memory impairment, amnesia, depression, and psychosis.
* Hypothermia, polyneuropathy, and hyperhidrosis.

Although hypothermia is usually diagnosed with a body temperature of 35 °C (95 °F) or less, incipient cooling caused by deregulation in the central nervous system (CNS) needs to be monitored because it can promote the development of an infection. The patient may report feeling cold, followed by mild chills, cold skin, moderate pallor, tachycardia, hypertension, tremor, or piloerection. External warming techniques are advised to prevent hypothermia.

Among the frequently altered functions is the cardio-circulatory. There may be tachycardia, dyspnea, chest pain, orthostatic hypotension, changes in heart rate and blood pressure. The lack of thiamine sometimes affects other major energy consumers, the myocardium, and also patients may have developed cardiomegaly. Heart failure with lactic acidosis syndrome has been observed. Cardiac abnormalities are an aspect of the WE, which was not included in the traditional approach, and are not classified as a separate disease.
Infections have been pointed out as one of the most frequent triggers of death in WE. Furthermore, infections are usually present in pediatric cases.

In the last stage, other symptoms may occur: hyperthermia, increased muscle tone, spastic paralysis, choreic dyskinesias, and coma.

Because of the frequent involvement of the heart, eyes, and peripheral nervous system, several authors prefer to call it Wernicke disease rather than simply encephalopathy.

Early symptoms are nonspecific, and it has been stated that WE may present nonspecific findings. In Wernicke Korsakoff&#x27;s syndrome some single symptoms are present in about one-third.

===Location of the lesion===
Depending on the location of the brain lesion, different symptoms are more frequent:
* Brainstem tegmentum. – Ocular: pupillary changes. Extraocular muscle palsy; gaze palsy: nystagmus.
* Hypothalamus. Medulla: dorsal nuc. of vagus. – Autonomic dysfunction: temperature, cardiocirculatory, respiratory.
* Medulla: vestibular region. Cerebellum. – Ataxia.
* Dorsomedial nuc. of the thalamus. Mammillary bodies. – Amnestic syndrome for recent memory.
Mamillary lesions are characteristic-small petechial hemorrhages.
* Diffuse cerebral dysfunction.- Altered cognition: global confusional state.
* Brainstem: periaqueductal gray.- Reduction of consciousness
* Hypothalamic lesions may also affect the immune system, which is known in people who consume excessive amounts of alcohol, causing dysplasias and infections.

===Korsakoff syndrome===
Korsakoff syndrome, characterised by memory impairment, confabulation, confusion, and personality changes, has a strong and recognised link with WE. A very high percentage of patients with Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome also have peripheral neuropathy, and many people who consume excess alcohol have this neuropathy without other neurologic signs or symptoms. Korsakoff&#x27;s occurs much more frequently in WE due to chronic alcoholism. It is uncommon among those who do not consume excessive amounts of alcohol. Up to 80% of WE patients who misuse alcohol develop Korsakoff&#x27;s syndrome. In Korsakoff&#x27;s, atrophy of the thalamus and the mammillary bodies and frontal lobe involvement is usually observed. In a study, half of Wernicke–Korsakoff cases had good recovery from the amnesic state, which may take from 2 months to 10 years.

== Risk factors ==
Wernicke encephalopathy has classically been thought of as a disease solely of people who drink excessive amounts of alcohol, but it is also found in the chronically undernourished, and in recent years has been discovered post bariatric surgery. Without being exhaustive, the documented causes of Wernicke encephalopathy have included:
* pancreatitis, liver dysfunction, chronic diarrhea, celiac disease, Crohn&#x27;s disease, uremia, thyrotoxicosis
* vomiting, hyperemesis gravidarum, malabsorption, gastrointestinal surgery or diseases
* incomplete parenteral nutrition, starvation/fasting
* chemotherapy, renal dialysis, diuretic therapy, stem cell/marrow transplantation
* cancer, AIDS, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, febrile infections
* this disease may even occur in some people with normal, or even high blood thiamine levels, or people with deficiencies in intracellular transport of this vitamin. Selected genetic mutations, including presence of the X-linked transketolase-like 1 gene, SLC19A2 thiamine transporter protein mutations, and the aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 gene, which may predispose to alcohol use disorder. The APOE epsilon-4 allele, involved in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, may increase the chance of developing neurological symptoms.

==Pathophysiology==
Thiamine deficiency and errors of thiamine metabolism are believed to be the primary cause of Wernicke encephalopathy. Thiamine, also called B1, helps to break down glucose. Specifically, it acts as an essential coenzyme to the TCA cycle and the pentose phosphate shunt. Thiamine is first metabolised to its more active form, thiamine diphosphate (TDP), before it is used. The body only has 2–3 weeks of thiamine reserves, which are readily exhausted without intake, or if depletion occurs rapidly, such as in chronic inflammatory states or in diabetes. Thiamine is involved in:
# Metabolism of carbohydrates, releasing energy.
# Production of neurotransmitters including glutamic acid and GABA.
# Lipid metabolism, necessary for myelin production.
# Amino acid modification. Probably linked to the production of taurine, of great cardiac importance.

===Neuropathology===
The primary neurological-related injury caused by thiamine deficiency in WE is three-fold: oxidative damage, mitochondrial injury leading to apoptosis, and directly stimulating a pro-apoptotic pathway. Thiamine deficiency affects both neurons and astrocytes, glial cells of the brain. Thiamine deficiency alters the glutamate uptake of astrocytes, through changes in the expression of astrocytic glutamate transporters EAAT1 and EAAT2, leading to excitotoxicity. Other changes include those to the GABA transporter subtype GAT-3, GFAP, glutamine synthetase, and the Aquaporin 4 channel. Focal lactic acidosis also causes secondary oedema, oxidative stress, inflammation and white matter damage.

===Pathological anatomy===

Despite its name, WE is not related to Wernicke&#x27;s area, a region of the brain associated with speech and language interpretation.

Brain lesions in WE are usually credited to focal lactic acidosis. An absence of thiamine can lead to too much pyruvate within the cells since it is not available to help convert pyruvate through the TCA cycle. An increase in pyruvate causes an increase in lactate concentration leading to focal lactic acidosis.

Lesions can be reversed in most cases with immediate supplementation of thiamine.

Lesions are usually symmetrical in the periventricular region, diencephalon, the midbrain, hypothalamus, and cerebellar vermis. Brainstem lesions may include cranial nerve III, IV, VI and VIII nuclei, the medial thalamic nuclei, and the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve. Oedema may be found in the regions surrounding the third ventricle, and fourth ventricle, also appearing petechiae and small hemorrhages. Chronic cases can present the atrophy of the mammillary bodies.

In 1949, the idea that WE lesions are a result of a disruption to the blood-brain barrier was introduced. Large proteins passing into the brain can put neurological tissue at risk of toxic effects. The blood-brain barrier junctions are typically found to have WE lesions located at that region of the brain.

An altered blood–brain barrier may cause a perturbed response to certain drugs and foods.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of Wernicke encephalopathy or disease is made clinically. Caine et al. in 1997 established criteria that Wernicke encephalopathy can be diagnosed in any patient with just two or more of the main symptoms noted above. The sensitivity of the diagnosis by the classic triad was 23% but increased to 85% taking two or more of the four classic features. These criteria are challenged because all the cases he studied were people who drank excessive amounts of alcohol. Some consider it sufficient to suspect the presence of the disease with only one of the principal symptoms. Some British hospital protocols suspect WE with any one of these symptoms: confusion, decreased consciousness level (or unconsciousness, stupor or coma), memory loss, ataxia or unsteadiness, ophthalmoplegia or nystagmus, and unexplained hypotension with hypothermia. The presence of only one sign should be sufficient for treatment.

The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging (MR) was 53% and the specificity was 93%. The reversible cytotoxic edema was considered the most characteristic lesion of WE. The location of the lesions were more frequently atypical among people who drank appropriate amounts of alcohol, while typical contrast enhancement in the thalamus and the mammillary bodies was observed frequently associated with alcohol misuse. These abnormalities may include:
* Dorsomedial thalami, periaqueductal gray matter, mamillary bodies, tectal plate and brainstem nuclei are commonly affected. Involvement is always bilateral and symmetric. Value of DWI in the diagnosis of WE is minimal. Axial FLAIR MRI images represent the best diagnostic MRI sequence. Contrast material may highlight involvement of the mamillary bodies.
There appears to be very little value for CT scans.

Thiamine can be measured using an erythrocyte transketolase activity assay, or by activation by measurement of in vitro thiamine diphosphate levels. Normal thiamine levels do not necessarily rule out the presence of WE, as this may be a patient with difficulties in intracellular transport.

==Prevention==
There are hospital protocols for prevention, supplementing with thiamine in the presence of: history of alcohol misuse or related seizures, requirement for IV glucose, signs of malnutrition, poor diet, recent diarrhea or vomiting, peripheral neuropathy, intercurrent illness, delirium tremens or treatment for DTs, and others.

Some experts advise parenteral thiamine should be given to all at-risk patients in the emergency department.

In the clinical diagnosis should be remembered that early symptoms are nonspecific, and it has been stated that WE may present nonspecific findings. There is consensus to provide water-soluble vitamins and minerals after gastric operations.

In some countries certain foods have been supplemented with thiamine, and have reduced WE cases. Improvement is difficult to quantify because they applied several different actions. Avoiding or moderating alcohol consumption and having adequate nutrition reduces one of the main risk factors in developing Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome..

==Treatment==
Most symptoms will improve quickly if deficiencies are treated early. Memory disorder may be permanent.

In patients suspected of WE, thiamine treatment should be started immediately. Blood should be immediately taken to test for thiamine, other vitamins and minerals levels. Following this an immediate intravenous or intramuscular dose of thiamine should be administered two or three times daily. Thiamine administration is usually continued until clinical improvement ceases.

Considering the diversity of possible causes and several surprising symptomatologic presentations, and because there is low assumed risk of toxicity of thiamine, because the therapeutic response is often dramatic from the first day, some qualified authors indicate parenteral thiamine if WE is suspected, both as a resource for diagnosis and treatment. The diagnosis is highly supported by the response to parenteral thiamine, but is not sufficient to be excluded by the lack of it. Parenteral thiamine administration is associated with a very small risk of anaphylaxis.

People who consume excessive amounts of alcohol may have poor dietary intakes of several vitamins, and impaired thiamine absorption, metabolism, and storage; they may thus require higher doses.

If glucose is given, such as in people with an alcohol use disorder who are also hypoglycaemic, thiamine must be given concurrently. If this is not done, the glucose will rapidly consume the remaining thiamine reserves, exacerbating this condition.

The observation of edema in MR, and also the finding of inflation and macrophages in necropsied tissues, has led to successful administration of antiinflammatories.

Other nutritional abnormalities should also be looked for, as they may be exacerbating the disease. In particular, magnesium, a cofactor of transketolase which may induce or aggravate the disease.

Other supplements may also be needed, including: cobalamin, ascorbic acid, folic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, phosphorus (dicalcium phosphate) and in some cases taurine, especially suitable when there cardiocirculatory impairment.
Patient-guided nutrition is suggested. In patients with Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, even higher doses of parenteral thiamine are recommended. Concurrent toxic effects of alcohol should also be considered.

==Epidemiology==
There are no conclusive statistical studies, all figures are based on partial studies.

Wernicke&#x27;s lesions were observed in 0.8 to 2.8% of the general population autopsies, and 12.5% of people with an alcohol use disorder. This figure increases to 35% of such individuals if including cerebellar damage due to lack of thiamine.

Most autopsy cases were from people with an alcohol use disorder. Autopsy series were performed in hospitals on the material available which is unlikely to be representative of the entire population. Considering the slight affectations, previous to the generation of observable lesions at necropsy, the percentage should be higher. There is evidence to indicate that Wernicke encephalopathy is underdiagnosed. For example, in one 1986 study, 80% of cases were diagnosed postmortem. Is estimated that only 5–14% of patients with WE are diagnosed in life.

In a series of autopsy studies held in Recife, Brazil, it was found that only 7 out of 36 had consumed excessive amounts of alcohol, and only a small minority had malnutrition. In a reviewed of 53 published case reports from 2001 to 2011, the relationship with alcohol was also about 20% (10 out of 53 cases).

WE related to alcohol misuse is more common in males and is more common in females when not related to alcohol misuse. In alcohol-related cases, WE patients average the age of 40, and non-alcohol-related cases typically occur in younger people.

==History==
WE was first identified in 1881 by the German neurologist Carl Wernicke, although the link with thiamine was not identified until the 1930s.

Carl Wernicke discovered the sensory center of speech. Wernicke figured out that Broca&#x27;s area was not the only center of speech, it was also able to distinguish motor aphasia from sensory aphasia. He also pointed to the possibility of conduction aphasia since he came to understand the arrangement of the brain&#x27;s extrinsic and intrinsic connections. He demonstrated that the sensory information reached its corresponding area in the cerebral cortex through projection fibers. From there, this information, following the association system, would be distributed to different regions of the cortex, integrating sensory processing.

He reported three patients with WE, including two men (aged 33 and 36) who were alcoholics and one woman (aged 20) who ingested sulfuric acid, leading to pyloric stenosis. All three had ocular motor abnormalities and he performed an autopsy on each, providing a clinical-pathological correlation.

A similar presentation of this disease was described by the Russian psychiatrist Sergei Korsakoff in a series of articles published 1887–1891; where the chronic version of WE was described as Korsakoff&#x27;s Syndrome, involving symptoms of amnesia.

<text>The Light of Other Days is a 2000 science fiction novel written by Stephen Baxter based on a synopsis by Arthur C. Clarke, which explores the development of wormhole technology to the point where information can be passed instantaneously between points in the spacetime continuum.

==Plot==
Wormhole technology has advanced to the point where information can be passed instantaneously between points in the spacetime continuum. The wormhole technology is first used to send digital information via gamma rays, then developed further to transmit light waves. The media corporation that develops this advance can spy on anyone, anywhere it chooses. A logical development from the laws of space-time allows light waves to be detected from the past. This enhances the wormhole technology into a &quot;time viewer&quot; where anyone opening a wormhole can view people and events from any point throughout time and space.

When the technology is released to the general public, it effectively destroys all secrecy and privacy. The novel examines the philosophical issues that arise from the world&#x27;s population (increasingly suffering from ecological and political disturbances) being aware that they could be under constant observation by anyone, or that they could observe anyone without their knowledge. Anyone is able to observe the true past events of their families and their heroes. An underground forms which attempts to escape this observation; corruption and crime are drastically reduced; states discover the true causes and outcomes of international conflicts; and religions worldwide are forced to re-evaluate their divine histories. As the underground movement grows, it utilises a direct neural interface coupled with the unlimited communication provided by the wormhole technology to develop a group mind.

One of the central themes of the novel is that history is biased towards viewpoints of the person who wrote it. Hence many great &quot;historical&quot; events often did not occur as they now are collectively remembered. For example, during the book&#x27;s progression, the time viewer technology shows that Jesus was the illegitimate son of a Roman centurion (although the apocryphal story of his visiting Great Britain is proven to be true), and that Moses was based on a collection of stories rather than the actions of a real person.

A time hole is opened to the beginning of life on Earth, and it is discovered that all existing life is descended from a biological sample placed by intelligent beings (labeled Sisyphans) who inhabited the Earth over three billion years ago, trying to preserve genetic samples when geological and climatic changes and a large bolide threatened an extinction level event.

By combining past viewing with neural sensing wormholes, scientists also find ways to copy the dead from the past and upload them to the present, achieving Nikolai Fedorov&#x27;s vision of technological resurrection of the dead, bringing back to life all the dead from the past.

==Characters==
* Hiram Patterson is the father of Bobby Patterson and David Curzon, and the founder and CEO of the fictional company OurWorld. His first name in Hebrew means &quot;high-bred&quot; which denotes his high status. The success of the WormCam and the SmartShroud (which makes objects invisible, thus undetectable by the WormCam) is only the tip of the iceberg for him; he plans to use wormholes to extract energy from the Earth and the stars themselves to monopolise the energy industry. As the main antagonist, Hiram seems to be the personification of a misanthropic view of humanity – greedy, Machiavellian, and entirely self-serving. He manipulates the main characters starting in the first chapter: Bobby is given a brain implant at an early age so that he can be controlled; David receives a superb education so that he may be useful in the future; and, in an effort to further assert his control over Bobby, Kate is framed for allegedly stealing information from a competing company. His professed love for Bobby is in fact just a ploy to mould him into the perfect heir.
* Kate Manzoni is a journalist who is credited with breaking the story of the &quot;Wormwood Discovery&quot;. First detected by a group of amateur astronomers, the Wormwood is a supermassive asteroid on a direct collision course with Earth, projected to arrive in approximately five hundred years with potentially cataclysmic consequences. News of the Wormwood has profound impacts on the world&#x27;s political and social climate, coinciding with those brought on by advances in WormCam technology. Kate falls in love with Hiram&#x27;s son Bobby and assists him in breaking free of his father&#x27;s manipulation, while inadvertently allowing herself to be manipulated by Hiram.
* David Curzon is Hiram&#x27;s son from his first marriage and Bobby&#x27;s half-brother. His first name is derived from the Biblical character, David, who was once the king of Israel. David&#x27;s research leads to the development of the WormCam and many of its subsequent advances.
* Bobby Patterson is Hiram&#x27;s cloned son and heir apparent, and the half-brother of David.

==Similar themes in literature==
* &quot;Light of Other Days&quot; is the title of a 1966 Hugo- and Nebula-nominated short story by Bob Shaw. It was incorporated into a novel in 1972, &quot;Other Days, Other Eyes&quot;, which also dealt with issues of surveillance and privacy. The title for both the novel and the short story is drawn from the poem &quot;Light of Other Days&quot; by Thomas Moore.
* A time viewer is also used in Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;, although it plays a minor role in the plot. Clarke discusses this device and its use in other science fiction in the afterword to the novel.
* The 1956 Isaac Asimov short story &quot;The Dead Past&quot; also deals with the construction of a time viewer. The revelation of its impact on privacy comprises part of its twist ending.
* &quot;O.B.I.T.&quot; is an episode of the original &quot;Outer Limits&quot; TV show (aired 4 November 1963) which included a device that allowed viewing of ongoing current events.

<text>Louis-Marcelin, marquis de Fontanes (6 March 175717 March 1821) was a French poet and politician.

==Biography==
Born in Niort (Deux-Sèvres), he belonged to a noble Protestant family of Languedoc which had been reduced to poverty by the revocation of the edict of Nantes. His father and grandfather remained Protestant, but he was himself brought up as a Catholic. His parents died in 1774–1775, and in 1777 Fontanes went to Paris, where he found a friend in the dramatist Jean-François Ducis.

His first published poems, some of which were inspired by English models, appeared in the &quot;Almanach des Muses&quot;; &quot;Le Cri de mon coeur&quot;, describing his own sad childhood, in 1778; and &quot;La Fort de Navarre&quot; in 1780. His translation from Alexander Pope, &quot;L&#x27;Essai sur l&#x27;homme&quot;, was published with an elaborate preface in 1783, and &quot;La Chartreuse&quot; and &quot;Le Jour des morts&quot; in the same year, &quot;Le Verger&quot; in 1788 and his &quot;Epître sur l&#x27;édit en faveur des non-catholiques&quot;, and the &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;astronomie&quot; in 1789.

Fontanes was a moderate reformer, and in 1790 he became joint-editor of the &quot;Modérateur&quot;. He married at Lyon in 1792, and his wife&#x27;s first child was born during their flight from the siege of that town. Fontanes was in hiding in Paris when the four citizens of Lyon were sent to the Convention to protest against the cruelties of Collot d&#x27;Herbois. The petition was drawn up by Fontanes, and the authorship being discovered, he fled from Paris and found shelter at Sevran, near Livry, and afterwards at Andelys.

On the fall of Robespierre he was made professor of literature in the École Centrale des Quatre-Nations, and he was one of the original members of the Institute. In the &quot;Memorial&quot;, a journal edited by Jean-François de la Harpe, he discreetly advocated reaction to the monarchical principle. He was exiled by the Directory and made his way to London, where he was closely associated with Chateaubriand.

He soon returned to France, and his admiration for Napoleon, who commissioned him to write an &quot;éloge&quot; on George Washington, secured his return to the Institute and his political promotion. In 1802 he was elected to the legislative chamber, of which he was president from 1804 to 1810. Other honors and titles followed. He has been accused of servility to Napoleon, but he had the courage to remonstrate with him on the judicial murder of the duc d&#x27;Enghien, and as grand master of the University of Paris (1808–1815) he consistently supported religious and monarchical principles. He acquiesced in the Bourbon restoration, and was made a marquis in 1817. He died on March 17, 1821, in Paris, leaving eight cantos of an unfinished epic poem entitled &quot;La Grèce sauvée&quot;.

The verse of Fontanes is polished and musical in the style of the 18th century. It was not collected until 1839, when Sainte-Beuve edited the &quot;Œuvres&quot; (2 vols.) of Fontanes, with a sympathetic critical study of the author and his career. But by that time the Romantic movement was in the ascendant and Fontanes met with small appreciation.

<doc id="526670" wikidata="Q3520848" url="?curid=526670" title="Chandu Borde">
<text>Chandrakant Gulabrao &quot;Chandu&quot; Borde (born 21 July 1934), is an Indian former cricketer who played for India between 1958 and 1970. Following his retirement, he became a cricket administrator and twice served as India&#x27;s chairman of selectors.

==Personal life==
Borde was born into a Marathi Christian family in Pune, having five brothers and five sisters. His younger brother Ramesh Borde was also a cricketer who played for West Zone and Maharashtra in domestic cricket. Borde says Vijay Hazare is his idol and he was once able to share the dressing room with him.

==Domestic cricket==
Borde made his first-class debut in India&#x27;s 1952/53 domestic season.

He first played for Baroda against Gujarat in Ahmedabad in December 1954. He played in the semi-final against Holkar and was bowled for a duck. He had more success in the following season, making a century against Bombay. In the 1957/58 Ranji Trophy final against Services, he scored a half-century and picked up 5 wickets in the match.

He returned to Maharashtra after a transfer in 1964.

==Test cricket==
===The beginning===
Borde made his debut in the First Test during the West Indies tour of India. Over the first two Tests, his performance was ordinary and he was dropped for the Third Test in favour of debutant Ramnath Kenny. After a poor performance from Kenny, Borde was recalled and made his maiden Test half-century. In the Fifth and final Test of the series, Borde made his international breakthrough with a maiden century, 109 and then 96 in the second innings of a drawn match.

In the next series, India toured England, and Borde fractured the little finger on the left hand in the First Test, and missed the second Test. Over the next 11 matches, Borde scored only two half-centuries and took 14 wickets as Australia and Pakistan toured India. In the Fourth Test against Pakistan in Madras, he made 177*, his second century and highest Test score, combining in a 177-run stand with fellow centurion Polly Umrigar.

===Contributions in Indian victories===
Borde played a key part in India&#x27;s first victory over England in the Fourth Test played in Eden Gardens, Kolkata, scoring two half centuries (68 and 61) and taking 3 wickets in the First Test. In the following Test in Madras, India won again with Borde taking five wickets.

India&#x27;s tour of the West Indies in 1961/62 was disappointing, resulting in a 5–0 whitewash. Borde had a mediocre series scoring 244 runs at 24.4 and taking only six wickets. He followed it with good performances in the next two series (England in India, and Australian tour of India) scoring 383 at 42.55 and taking ten wickets in eight Tests.

===Kiwi pleasure===
New Zealand toured India in 1964/65 and Borde took a liking to the opposition, scoring a century in Brabourne Stadium, Bombay in the Third Test. It was one of three centuries in the series. He finished with 371 runs at 60.81. The series also marked the last time that Borde bowled at international level. Borde followed up the successful New Zealand series with another great individual performance in the home series against West Indies scoring two centuries as India lost the three Test series 2–0.

===Honors: RoW XI selection and Test match captaincy===
Borde was the only Indian representative in the &quot;Rest of the World XI&quot; squad that played against Barbados in March 1967.

Borde captained the Indian team in the First Test against Australia at the Adelaide Oval in December 1967. The Nawab of Pataudi resumed his position as captain in the next match.

===Career twilight===
Outside his sole Test as captain in Australia, Borde had disappointing performances on the tours to Australia, England and New Zealand scoring 468 runs at 24.67 in 11 Tests with only four half-centuries. Playing only as a specialist batsman, Borde was dropped as part of a youth selection policy, with his place taken by Gundappa Viswanath after the First Test against Australia at Brabourne Stadium.

==Cricket administrator==
Borde had two stints as the chairman of the national selection committee:

* 1984 to 1986
* 1999 to 2002

Apart from his duties as chairman of the selection committee, Borde has handled other tasks for Indian cricket, including:

* Manager, India&#x27;s tour of Pakistan in 1989.
* Pitch curator, Nehru Stadium, Pune (1984–present).
* Manager, India&#x27;s tour of Ireland and England in 2007.

Borde published his autobiography in July 2018, titled &quot;Panther&#x27;s Paces&quot; (as told to Mohan Sinha).

==Records==
* Borde scored 1,604 first-class runs in 1964–65 which was an Indian record for a season. The record was broken in 2016–17 by Cheteshwar Pujara.

==Awards==
Borde has received several awards from the Government of India and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for his contributions to cricket:
* 1966: Was awarded the Arjuna Award by Government of India making him the fourth cricketer to receive the award.
* 1969: Was awarded the Padma Shri
* 2002: Awarded Padma Bhushan – India&#x27;s third highest civilian award.
* 2003: C. K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award, awarded by the BCCI.

<doc id="526677" wikidata="Q2723759" url="?curid=526677" title="Yashwant Sinha">
<text>Yashwant Sinha (, born 6 November 1937) is an Indian politician and former Indian Administrative Service officer. He served as the Minister of Finance from 1990 until 1991 under Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar and again from March 1998 to July 2002 under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He also served as the Minister of External Affairs from July 2002 until May 2004. He was a senior leader of the BJP before he left the party on 21 April 2018. In 2022, he was the Presidential candidate of India for the opposition.

== Early life ==
Sinha was born in a Kayastha family in Patna, Bihar. He graduated from University of Patna in BA Hons(History). He received his master&#x27;s degree in political science in 1958. Subsequently, he taught the subject at the University of Patna until 1962.

== Civil Service career ==
After securing All India rank 12th in the UPSC Civil Services Examination.

Sinha joined the Indian Administrative Service in 1960 and spent over 24 years holding important posts during his service tenure. He served as Sub-Divisional Magistrate and District Magistrate for 4 years. He was Under Secretary and Deputy Secretary in the Finance Department of the Bihar Government for 2 years after which he worked in the Ministry of Commerce as Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.

From 1971 to 1973, he was First Secretary (Commercial) in the Indian Embassy, Bonn, West Germany. Subsequently, he worked as Consul General of India in Frankfurt from 1973 to 1974. After working for over seven years in this field, he acquired experience in matters relating to foreign trade and India&#x27;s relations with the European Economic Community. Thereafter, he worked in the Department of Industrial Infrastructure, Government of Bihar State and in the Ministry of Industry, Government of India dealing with foreign industrial collaborations, technology imports, intellectual property rights, and industrial approvals.

He later was Joint Secretary to Government of India in the Ministry of Surface Transport from 1980 to 1984, his main responsibilities were road transport, ports, and shipping. He resigned from service in 1984.

== Political career ==

=== Janata Dal ===
Sinha resigned from the Indian Administrative Service in 1984 and joined active politics as a member of the Janata Party. He was appointed All-India General secretary of the party in 1986 and was elected Member of the Rajya Sabha (Upper House of the Indian Parliament) in 1988.

When the Janata Dal was formed in 1989, he was appointed General Secretary of the party. He worked as Minister of Finance from November 1990 to June 1991 in Chandra Shekhar&#x27;s Cabinet.

=== BJP ===
He became the National Spokesperson of the BJP in June 1996. He was elected to Lok Sabha as a BJP candidate from Hazaribagh in 1998, 1999, and 2009. He was appointed Finance Minister in March 1998. He was appointed Minister for External Affairs on 1 July 2002. In the 2004 Indian general election, he was defeated by Bhubneshwar Prasad Mehta of CPI. He re-entered the Parliament as a member of Rajya Sabha same year. On 13 June 2009, he resigned as vice-president of BJP. In 2018, he quit the BJP citing the &quot;party&#x27;s condition&quot; and that &quot;democracy in India is in great danger&quot;.

In his autobiography &quot;Drohkaal ka Pathik&quot;, released in November 2013, former MP Pappu Yadav alleged that three MPs of his Indian Federal Democratic Party got money from the then finance minister Sinha, to join the NDA in 2001.

Also there were allegations against Yashwant Sinha, that he was involved in the UTI scam.

On 4 April 2017, Sinha was detained in Hazaribagh district along with BJP MLA Manish Jaiswal and 150 others after trying to hold a religious procession. On police stopping them, his supporters protested and allegedly threw stones at the police.

=== TMC and 2022 presidential campaign ===
On 13 March 2021, he joined TMC to fight against BJP just before the 2021 West Bengal Assembly Election. On 15 March 2021 he was appointed vice president of the Mamata Banerjee-led party. He was selected unanimously as the President Candidate of the Opposition for 2022 Presidential Election, making him the First TMC leader to be nominated for the President.

== Finance minister ==
Sinha was the finance minister until 1 July 2002, when he exchanged jobs with foreign minister Jaswant Singh. Sinha, during his tenure, was forced to roll back some of his government&#x27;s major policy initiatives for which he was much criticised. Still, Sinha is widely credited with pushing through several major reform measures that put the Indian economy on a firm growth trajectory. Among them are lowering of real interest rates, introducing tax deduction for mortgage interest, freeing up the telecommunications sector, helping fund the National Highways Authority, and deregulating the petroleum industry. Sinha is also known for being the first Finance Minister to break the 53-year tradition of presenting the Indian budget at 5 pm local time, a practice held over from British Rule days that sought to present the Indian budget at a time convenient to the British Parliament (1130am GMT) rather than India&#x27;s Parliament.

Sinha has written a comprehensive account of his years as Finance Minister titled &quot;Confessions of a Swadeshi Reformer&quot;.

Yashwant Sinha has been accused by opponents, and by other political observers of trying to promote nepotism by nominating his son Jayant Sinha as a successor to contest from Hazaribagh overlooking the interests of many other loyal party workers, though he tried to justify the nomination of his son as a party decision.

== Honors ==
In 2015, he was awarded Officier de la Légion d’Honneur, the highest civilian distinction of France. It was bestowed upon him in recognition of his work as Union Minister of Finance, Minister of External Foreign Affairs and for his invaluable contribution to international issues.

== Personal life ==
Sinha was born in a Bihari kayastha family and has a wide range of interests including reading, gardening and meeting people. He has widely travelled and has led a number of political and social delegations. He played a leading role in many negotiations on behalf of India. Sinha&#x27;s wife is Nilima Sinha, one of India&#x27;s leading children&#x27;s writers and President, Association of Writers and Illustrators for Children. They have a daughter, Sharmila, and two sons: Jayant Sinha and Sumant Sinha. Sinha blogs under the title &quot;Musings of a Swadeshi Reformer&quot;. He has co-authored the book &quot;India Unmade&quot; with Aditya Sinha.
