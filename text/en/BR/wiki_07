<text>Dukinfield is a town in Tameside, Greater Manchester, England, on the south bank of the River Tame opposite Ashton-under-Lyne, east of Manchester. At the 2021 census, the built up area as defined by the Office for National Statistics had a population of 21,155.

It lies within the historic county boundaries of Cheshire, and became part of Greater Manchester in 1974. The town developed as a result of the Industrial Revolution when it became the site of coal mining and cotton manufacturing.

==History==

===Early history===
The earliest evidence of human activity around Dukinfield comes from a collection of four flints from the late Neolithic/early Bronze Age. The artifacts were discovered on the site of Dukinfield Hall and have been taken as evidence of a prehistoric settlement on the site. There is no further evidence of activity in the area until the Roman period. A 3rd century bronze Roman coin, from the reign of Emperor Tetricus I was discovered in the town.

Dukinfield means &quot;Raven of the Field&quot; and derives from the Old English &quot;duce&quot; and &quot;feld&quot;.

Early records show the township was included in the fee of Dunham Massey. It was held by Matthew de Bramhall in about 1190, and after that by a family who took the name &quot;De Dokenfeld&quot;. The family lived at the moated Dukinfield Old Hall, which originated from after the Norman conquest and was rebuilt in Tudor times, remaining the home of the Dukinfields till the 18th century, after which it became derelict. During the English Civil War, Colonel Robert Duckenfield of Dukinfield Hall was a noted commander in the New Model Army. The Dukinfield of Dukinfield, Cheshire baronetcy was created in 1665 for Robert Dukinfield, son of Colonel Robert Dukinfield.

The Dukinfields held the manor for five centuries until the widow of Sir William Dukinfield Daniel married John Astley in 1767, and he inherited the estate when she died. John Astley was an artist and architect, and he designed and built Dukinfield Lodge on a hill overlooking the River Tame as a new seat for the family, replacing the old wooden hall. His son Francis Dukinfield Astley succeeded him as lord of the manor in 1787, and then his son, Francis Dukinfield Palmer Astley, followed in 1825.

===Industrial Revolution===

Industrialisation – particularly the cotton trade – helped shape the town, but its rapid development destroyed its former pasture and meadow land. Two cotton mills were built before 1794 and by 1825 there were seven. The industry continued to expand and by the end of the 19th century 14 spinning mills of varying sizes were in operation. The largest mills were built in brick during the 1890s with four or five storeys, large windows, ornamental towers, engine houses and tall brick built chimneys. They included Tower, Tame Valley, River, Park Road and Queen Mills. Most of the cotton mills have now been demolished, but some have been preserved and converted into flats.

Coal pits exploiting the underlying coal measures to the south of the Lancashire Coalfield were a major part of Dukinfield&#x27;s industrial history. One pithead was located on Birch Lane, now the site of All Saints&#x27; Catholic College, with another near the northern border with Ashton-under-Lyne. Francis Dukinfield Astley first started developing collieries in the town around 1820, and his son Francis Dukinfield Palmer Astley continued to develop the two most notable mines after his father&#x27;s death in 1825—Dukinfield and Astley Deep Pit—both of which suffered explosions which killed many workers:

* Dukinfield Colliery (also known as Lakes Pit or Victoria Colliery) was owned by Astley&#x27;s Dukinfield Colliery Company. The colliery had two shafts, the downcast was 1,020 feet deep to the Black mine (coal seam) and was connected to the upcast ventilation shaft. On 4 June 1867, 38 men and boys died of suffocation following an explosion caused by a faulty safety lamp and poor management.
* Astley Deep Pit, was off King&#x27;s Street opposite Brownlea Avenue was developed by Astley but by 1874 was owned by Benjamin Ashton. The colliery&#x27;s downcast shaft was 2,058 feet deep and its workings extended over a mile to the south and about 1,300 yards to the north of the shaft. This colliery was reported to be at one time, the deepest coal mine in the world, at 2,100 feet (640 metres) and had three shafts. On 14 April 1874 an underground gas explosion killed 54 men. After the pit closed in 1901 the shafts were filled in and left to stand for many years before being built on. It is now the site of a development of houses comprising Angel Close, Oval Drive and Silver Close.

Samuel Robinson—a Unitarian, industrialist, and scholar—founded the village library in 1833 and was dubbed the &quot;foremost promoter of education in the district&quot; before his death in 1884. Daniel Adamson a mechanical engineer became the first chairman of the Manchester Ship Canal Company. He owned an engineering works producing Lancashire boilers at Newton Wood beside the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. He died on 13 January 1890. The Adamson Military Band, named after Adamson is based in Dukinfield. The MS&amp;LR&#x27;s successor, the Great Central Railway, moved its carriage and wagon works to Dukinfield in 1910.

Dukinfield and its surrounding towns were major centres of civil revolt during the 19th century and briefly the area was a hotbed of Chartism, the popular movement calling for universal suffrage via a &quot;People&#x27;s Charter&quot;. Chartist leader, Reverend Joseph Rayner Stephens is buried in St John&#x27;s Churchyard.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering Dukinfield, at metropolitan borough level: Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council. The council is a member of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, which is led by the directly-elected Mayor of Greater Manchester. Two of the electoral wards for the council have Dukinfield in their names: Dukinfield and Dukinfield Stalybridge.

For national elections, the Dukinfield ward lies in the Ashton-under-Lyne constituency, and the Dukinfield Stalybridge ward lies in the Stalybridge and Hyde constituency.

===Administrative history===

Dukinfield was historically a township in the ancient parish of Stockport, which formed part of the Macclesfield Hundred of Cheshire. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Stockport, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Dukinfield became a civil parish.

In its north-eastern corner, the township included a large part of the town of Stalybridge, which rapidly developed during the industrial revolution. In 1828 a body of improvement commissioners was established to administer a newly-defined Stalybridge district, which straddled the three townships of Dukinfield and Stayley in Cheshire and Ashton-under-Lyne in Lancashire.

In 1857, the remainder of the Dukinfield township outside the Stalybridge district was made a local board district, administered by an elected local board. Later that year, the Stalybridge commissioners&#x27; district was incorporated to become a municipal borough.

Local board districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. The 1894 Act also directed that civil parishes could no longer straddle district or borough boundaries, and so Dukinfield parish lost its territory within the borough of Stalybridge. The boundary between Dukinfield and neighbouring Aston-under-Lyne to the north was adjusted in 1898 to follow the modern course of the River Tame; previously the boundary had followed the more meandering pre-industrial revolution course of the river, which had been altered as various mills and urban development had been laid out along the river&#x27;s banks.

Dukinfield Urban District was incorporated in 1899 to become a municipal borough. The borough council was granted a coat of arms in 1900. The council subsequently built Dukinfield Town Hall on King Street to serve as its headquarters, which was completed in 1901. The borough was expanded in 1936, gaining part of the civil parish of Matley, which was abolished.

The borough of Dukinfield was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside in Greater Manchester.

==Geography and geology==
At (53.477818° -2.092584°), and north-northwest of London, Dukinfield&#x27;s borders are defined to the north and west by the River Tame.

The town is situated at the edge of the Cheshire Plain where it meets the Pennines, and Dukinfield is the first town on the hill. The park is situated approximately a quarter of a mile from the town hall along King Street towards Hyde in the south. Because of the quite steep rise out of the plain, the park is terraced and is over 90 feet higher at the top. The hill flattens out slightly before rising steeply again towards the east, where the library is situated.
The town hall is also at the base of the same hill with Astley Street rising steeply along its shorter southern side before climbing some 120 feet to the crest of the ridge. The local soil is mainly clayey with some alluvial deposits.

The underlying geology is the middle coal measures, which run north–south under Tameside. Dukinfield is situated on the site of a vast ancient lake or swamp that covered the area. This ancient lake is the reason coal is found in the area. The layers of shale and coal are laid on top of each other in bands, only 20 or 30 feet thick. The coal deposits fall away at a 20-degree or so angle, and runs eight or nine miles from the base of the hill out under the plain. The coal deposits are known as the Dukinfield Marine Band and form a V shape running out from here towards Stockport in the south and Ashton Moss in the north-east. Dukinfield had several mines of which Astley Deep Pit had the best coal. There are many seams or mines of coal found here. Dukinfield coal was known to be the best for heating and steam generation. Only a mile to the south along Hyde Road is another large mine, the Dewsnap Colliery, which was of a lower quality and so was not in as much demand.
The Dukinfield Marine Band outcrops at Dukinfield, and continues up the hill towards the top of the ridge, some 140 feet above the level of the plain where it flattens out and a third mine was situated.

==Demography==
According to the Office for National Statistics, at the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, Dukinfield had a population of 18,885. The 2001 population density was , with a 100 to 93.9 female-to-male ratio. Of those over 16 years old, 29.1% were single (never married), 42.1% married, and 9.4% divorced. Dukinfield&#x27;s 8,072 households included 31.2% one-person, 36.8% married couples living together, 9.9% were co-habiting couples, and 10.5% single parents with their children. Of those aged 16–74, 35.1% had no academic qualifications.

At the 2001 UK census, 79.0% of Dukinfield&#x27;s residents reported themselves as Christian, 0.9% Hindu, 0.8% Muslim, and 0.1% Buddhist. The census recorded 12.2% as having no religion, 0.1% had an alternative religion and 6.8% did not state their religion.

===Population change===
Dukinfield grew from a small village just south of Ashton-under-Lyne with open land to the south and east, the gap between it and the surrounding towns of Hyde and Matley being a semicircle around 1.5 miles wide, to fill the gap entirely by the late 1940s. In its early days from 1801, and previously, the population was small but boomed during the days of the cotton industry and later the coal industry with its major rail junction adding to its prosperity and growth.

The industries which sustained it died out by the turn of the 1900s, leaving only the Daniel Adamson Ltd works but it managed to maintain its population and has only declined by 2000 since 1921. One reason is that it has a central location on the main road from Stockport to Ashton-under-Lyne and is within easy commuting distance of Manchester.

==Economy==
According to the 2001 UK census, the industry of employment of residents of Dukinfield aged 16–74 was 24.4% manufacturing, 19.3% retail and wholesale, 10.0% health and social work, 9.5% property and business services, 7.2% construction, 6.5% transport and communications, 5.7% education, 4.7% public administration, 4.4% finance, 3.4% hotels and restaurants, 1.0% energy and water supply, 0.3% agriculture, 0.1% mining, and 3.6% other. Compared with national figures, the town had a relatively high proportion of people working in manufacturing, and low levels of people working in agriculture, public administration, and education. The census recorded the economic activity of residents aged 16–74, 2.1% students were with jobs, 2.8% students without jobs, 4.9% looking after home or family, 7.9% permanently sick or disabled, and 2.7% economically inactive for other reasons.

==Landmarks==

Dukinfield Town Hall was built in the late 1890s and opened in 1901. It was built by raising funds from the inception of the Borough of Dukinfield. The park was also made and cost the same amount of money as the town hall. There is an 80 ft difference between the King Street lower side and the rear of the park, being the first hill off the Cheshire Plain, and on a clear day it is possible to stand at the top of the steps and see Manchester city centre.

Old Hall Chapel is an old historic church, claiming to be the first independent church in the 17th century. It was built during the late 15th century but is unfortunately partially derelict due to fire in the 1970s which destroyed much of the superstructure of the roof.

<doc id="511292" wikidata="Q7111384" url="?curid=511292" title="Out-group homogeneity">
<text>The out-group homogeneity effect is the perception of out-group members as more similar to one another than are in-group members, e.g. &quot;they are alike; we are diverse&quot;. Perceivers tend to have impressions about the diversity or variability of group members around those central tendencies or typical attributes of those group members. Thus, outgroup stereotypicality judgments are overestimated, supporting the view that out-group stereotypes are overgeneralizations. The term &quot;outgroup homogeneity effect&quot;, &quot;outgroup homogeneity bias&quot; or &quot;relative outgroup homogeneity&quot; have been explicitly contrasted with &quot;outgroup homogeneity&quot; in general, the latter referring to perceived outgroup variability unrelated to perceptions of the ingroup.

The outgroup homogeneity effect is sometimes referred to as &quot;outgroup homogeneity bias&quot;. Such nomenclature hints at a broader meta-theoretical debate that is present in the field of social psychology. This debate centres on the validity of heightened perceptions of ingroup and outgroup homogeneity, where some researchers view the homogeneity effect as an example of cognitive bias and error, while other researchers view the effect as an example of normal and often adaptive social perception. The out-group homogeneity effect has been found using a wide variety of different social groups, from political and racial groups to age and gender groups.

The out-group homogeneity effect is part of a broader field of research that examines perceived group variability. This area includes in-group homogeneity effects as well as out-group homogeneity effects, and it also deals with perceived group variability effects that are not linked to in-group/out-group membership, such as effects that are related to the power, status, and size of groups. The out-group homogeneity effect has been found using a wide variety of different social groups, from political and racial groups to age and gender groups. The implications of this effect on stereotyping have been noted.

==Empirical support==
An example of this phenomenon comes from a study where researchers asked 90 sorority members to judge the degree of within-group similarity for their own and 2 other groups. It was found that every participant judged their own sorority members to be more dissimilar than the members of the other groups.

===Racial investigation===
In an experiment, researchers revealed that people of other races do seem to look more alike than members of one&#x27;s own race. When white students were shown faces of a few white and a few black individuals, they later more accurately recognized white faces they had seen and often falsely recognized black faces not seen before. The opposite results were found when subjects consisted of black individuals.

==Explanations==
This bias was found to be unrelated to the number of group and non-group members individuals knew. One might think that people thought members of their own groups were more varied and different simply because they knew them better and thus have more information about ingroups, but this is actually not the case. The out-group homogeneity bias was found between groups such as &quot;men&quot; and &quot;women&quot; who obviously interact frequently.

Elsewhere, this difference is attributed to differences in how people store or process in-group versus out-group information. However, this concept has been challenged due to some cases in which in-groups view themselves as homogeneous. Researchers have postulated that such an effect is present when viewing a group as homogeneous helps to promote in-group solidarity. Experiments on the topic found that in-group homogeneity is displayed when people who highly identify with a group are presented with stereotypical information about that group.

===Self-categorization theory ===

Self-categorization theory attributes the outgroup homogeneity effect to the differing contexts that are present when perceiving outgroups and ingroups. For outgroups, a perceiver will experience an intergroup context and therefore attend to differences between the two groups. Consequently, less attention is paid to differences between outgroup members and this leads to perceptions of outgroup homogeneity. When perceiving ingroup members a perceiver may experience either an intergroup context or an &quot;intragroup&quot; context. In an intergroup context the ingroup would also be predicted to be seen as comparatively homogeneous as the perceiver attends to the differences between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; (in other words, depersonalization occurs). However, in an intragroup context the perceiver may be motivated to attend to differences with the group (between &quot;me&quot; and &quot;others in the group&quot;) leading to perceptions of comparative ingroup heterogeneity. As perceivers are less often motivated to perform intra-group outgroup comparison, this leads to an overall outgroup homogeneity effect.

The self-categorization theory account is supported by evidence showing that in an intergroup context both the ingroup and outgroup will be perceived as more homogenous, while when judged in isolation the ingroup will be perceived as comparatively heterogeneous. The self-categorization theory account eliminates the need to posit differing processing mechanisms for ingroups and outgroups, as well as accounting for findings of outgroup homogeneity in the minimal group paradigm.

===Social identity theory ===

Another body of research looked at ingroup and outgroup homogeneity from the perspective of social identity theory. While complementary to the self-categorization theory account, this body of research was concerned more with specific homogeneity effects associated with the motivations of perceivers. They derived from social identity theory the prediction that comparative &quot;ingroup&quot; homogeneity will at times arise due to demands to establish a positive and distinct social identity. For example, members of minority groups would be particularly likely to accentuate intragroup solidity through the emphasis of ingroup homogeneity. This is because minority group members, due to their minority status, are likely to experience threat to their self-esteem. This was empirically supported.

Within the same tradition it was also hypothesised that an ingroup homogeneity effect would emerge on ingroup defining dimensions for both minority and majority group members. This too was empirically supported. Recent research also has reaffirmed that this effect of in-group homogeneity on in-group defining dimensions and out-group homogeneity on out-group defining dimensions may occur because people use their ratings of perceived group variability to express the extent to which social groups possess specific characteristics. Like the self-categorization theory account, this recent research also suggests that the effect may occur &quot;independent&quot; of the motivational concerns described in social identity theory.

<doc id="511296" wikidata="Q791487" url="?curid=511296" title="Baudolino">
<text>Baudolino is a 2000 novel by Umberto Eco about the adventures of a man named Baudolino in the known and mythical Christian world of the 12th century.

&quot;Baudolino&quot; was translated into English in 2001 by William Weaver. The novel presented a number of particular difficulties in translation, not the least of which is that there are ten or so pages written in a made-up language that is a mixture of Latin, medieval Italian and other languages (intended to reconstruct how a barely-literate Italian peasant boy of the 12th century would have tried to write in the vernacular).

Saint Baudolino, a historically-attested hermit of the eighth century, is the Patron Saint of Alessandria, and thus it would be natural for a boy born there to bear his name.

==Plot summary==
In the year of 1204, Baudolino of Alessandria enters Constantinople, unaware of the Fourth Crusade that has thrown the city into chaos. In the confusion, he meets Niketas Choniates and saves his life. Niketas is amazed by his language genius, speaking many languages he has never heard, and Baudolino begins to recount his life story to Niketas.

His story begins in 1155, when Baudolino – a highly talented Italian peasant boy – is sold to and adopted by the emperor Frederick I. At court and on the battlefield, he is educated in reading and writing Latin and learns about the power struggles and battles of northern Italy at the time. He is sent to Paris to become a scholar.

In Paris, he gains friends (such as the Archpoet, Abdul, Robert de Boron and Kyot, the purported source of Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot;) and learns about the legendary kingdom of Prester John. From this event onward, Baudolino dreams of reaching this fabled land.

The earlier parts of the story follow the general historical and geographical outlines of 12th-century Europe, with special emphasis on the Emperor Frederick&#x27;s futile efforts to subdue the increasingly independent and assertive city states of Northern Italy. Baudolino, both a beloved adopted son to the Emperor and a loyal native of the newly founded and highly rebellious town of Alessandria, plays a key role in reconciliation between the Emperor and the Alessandria townspeople, who are led by Baudolino&#x27;s biological father; a way is found for the Emperor to recognize Alessandria&#x27;s independence without losing face. (It is no accident that Alessandria is Umberto Eco&#x27;s own hometown.) During the siege, Baudolino works on the side of Frederick Barbarossa, but concocts a plan to help win the Alessandrian townspeople independence. He attempts to convince the emperor&#x27;s forces that Alessandria is more prepared for a siege than them through stuffing a cow with the last of Alessandria&#x27;s wheat and sends the cow out to the Emperor&#x27;s forces. When the cow is cut open, it reveals a full belly of wheat. The emperor&#x27;s forces are convinced that Alessandria is not worth besieging, and thus leave.

The incident of the death of Emperor Frederick, while on the Third Crusade, is a key element of the plot. This part involves an element of secret history – the book asserts that Emperor Frederick had not drowned in a river, as history records, but died mysteriously at night while hosted at the castle of a sinister Armenian noble. This part also constitutes a historical detective mystery – specifically, a historical locked room mystery – with various suspects suggested, each of whom had a clever means of killing the Emperor, and with Baudolino acting as the detective.

After the Emperor&#x27;s death, Baudolino and his friends set off on a long journey, encompassing 15 years, to find the Kingdom of Prester John. From the moment when they depart eastwards, the book becomes pure fantasy – the lands which the band travels bearing no resemblance to the continent of Asia at that or any other historical time, being rather derived from the various myths which Europeans had about Asia – including the aforementioned Christian myth of the Kingdom of Prester John, as well as the Jewish myth of the Ten Lost Tribes and the River Sambation, and some earlier accounts provided by Herodotos. Baudolino meets eunuchs, unicorns, Blemmyes, skiapods and pygmies. At one point, he falls in love with a female satyr-like creature who recounts to him the full Gnostic creation myth (Gnosticism is a pervasive presence in another of Eco&#x27;s novels, &quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot;). Philosophical debates are mixed with comedy, epic adventure and creatures drawn from medieval bestiaries.

After many disastrous adventures, the destruction of Prester John&#x27;s Kingdom by the White Huns followed by a long stint of slavery at the hands of the Old Man of the Mountain, Baudolino and surviving members of his band of friends return to Constantinople undergoing the agony of the Fourth Crusade – the book&#x27;s starting point. Niketas Choniates helps Baudolino discover the truth about how the Emperor Frederick died – with shattering results for Baudolino and his friends.

<doc id="511302" wikidata="Q2691960" url="?curid=511302" title="Penalty shoot-out (association football)">
<text>In association football, a penalty shoot-out (previously known as kicks from the penalty mark) is a tie-breaking method to determine which team is awarded victory in a match that cannot end in a draw, when the score is tied after the normal time as well as extra time (if used) has expired (for example, in a FIFA World Cup, penalties are used in elimination matches; the round of 16, the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, and the final). In a penalty shoot-out, each team takes turns shooting at goal from the penalty mark, with the goal defended only by the opposing team&#x27;s goalkeeper. Each team has five shots which must be taken by different players; the team that makes more successful kicks is declared the victor. Shoot-outs finish as soon as one team has an insurmountable lead. If scores are level after five pairs of shots, the shootout progresses into additional &quot;sudden-death&quot; rounds. Balls successfully kicked into the goal during a shoot-out do not count as goals for the individual kickers or the team, and are tallied separately from the goals scored during normal play (including extra time, if any). Although the procedure for each individual kick in the shoot-out resembles that of a penalty kick, there are some differences. Most notably, neither the kicker nor any player other than the goalkeeper may play the ball again once it has been kicked.

The penalty shoot-out is one of the three methods of breaking a draw that are approved by the Laws of the Game; the others are extra time and, for two-legged ties, the away goals rule. A shoot-out is usually used only after one or more of the other methods fail to produce a winner. The method of breaking a draw for a specific match is determined beforehand by the match organising body. In most professional level competitions, two 15-minute extra time periods are played if the score is tied at the end of regulation time, and a shoot-out is held if the score is still tied after the extra time periods.

Although widely employed in football since the 1970s, penalty shoot-outs have been criticised by many followers of the game, due primarily to their perceived reliance on luck rather than skill and their dependence on individual duels between opposing players, which is arguably not in keeping with football as a team sport. However, some believe the pressure and unpredictability involved makes it one of the most thrilling finales to any sport.

==Overview==
During a shoot-out, players other than the kicker and the goalkeepers must remain in the centre circle. The kicking team&#x27;s goalkeeper stands at the intersection of the goal line and the line marking the penalty area () near one of the assistant referees. Goals scored during the shoot-out are not commonly added to the goalscoring records of the players involved.

A draw is a common result in football. Shoot-outs are only used in competitions that require a match-winner at the end of the game – this is predominantly in knockout &quot;cup&quot; ties, as opposed to round-robin &quot;leagues&quot;; they decide which team progresses to the next round of a tournament, or wins it. Usually extra time has been played first, but this is not necessary; exceptions include the Copa Libertadores, Copa América (quarter-finals, semi-finals, and third-place game), FA Community Shield, the EFL League Cup, and the Football League Trophy, all of which use shoot-outs straight after the end of normal time.

The rules of some competitions provide that a shoot-out may be used to decide placings in a round-robin group, in the unusual event that two teams who have faced each other in a final-day match finish the group with identical statistics, and no other team has the same record. This was invoked in Group A of the 2003 UEFA Women&#x27;s Under-19 Championship, in which Italy and Sweden held a shootout immediately after their drawn match. This rule is a relatively recent innovation, and for example did not apply in Group F of the 1990 World Cup, where the Republic of Ireland and the Netherlands were separated by drawing of lots immediately after drawing their final-day match, however, at the 1994 UEFA European Under-16 Championship, the penalty shoot-out was used in the last Group A match between Belarus and Austria.

Several leagues, such as the J.League, have experimented with penalty shoot-outs immediately following a drawn league match, with the winner being awarded an extra point. In the United States and Canada, Major League Soccer initially also had a shoot-out immediately following the end of full-time, even during league matches, although these shoot-outs differed from standard penalty shoot-outs (see below).

A team that loses a penalty shoot-out is eliminated from the tournament while the winning team in the shoot-out advances to the next round or is crowned champion but the match is classed as a draw by FIFA. For instance, the Netherlands are considered to have concluded the 2014 FIFA World Cup undefeated, despite being eliminated at the semi-final stage.

==Procedure==
The following is a summary of the procedure for kicks from the penalty mark. The procedure is specified in Law 10 (&quot;Determining the Outcome of a Match&quot;) of the &quot;Laws of the Game&quot; (p. 71).

# The referee tosses a coin to decide the goal at which the kicks are taken. The choice of goal may be changed by the referee for safety reasons or if the goal or playing surface becomes unusable.
# The referee tosses the coin a second time to determine which team takes the first kick.
# All players other than the kicker and the goalkeepers must remain in the pitch&#x27;s centre circle (see above).
# Each kick is taken in the general manner of a penalty kick. Each kick is taken from the penalty mark, which is from the goal line and equidistant from each touch line, with the goal defended only by the opposing goalkeeper. The goalkeeper must remain between the goal posts on their goal line until the ball has been kicked, although they can jump in place, wave their arms, move side to side along the goal line, or otherwise try to distract the shooter.
# Each team is responsible for setting the order in which its eligible players take kicks.
# Each kicker can kick the ball only once. Once kicked, the kicker may not play the ball again. The decision on a re-kick is solely at the referee&#x27;s discretion.
# No other player on either team, other than the designated kicker and goalkeeper, may touch the ball.
# A kick results in a goal scored for the kicking team if, having been touched once by the kicker, the ball crosses the goal line between the goal posts and under the crossbar, without touching any player, official, or outside agent other than the defending goalkeeper. The ball may touch the goalkeeper, goal posts, or crossbar any number of times before going into the goal as long as the referee believes the ball&#x27;s motion is the result of the initial kick. This was clarified after an incident in the 1986 World Cup shoot-out between Brazil and France. Bruno Bellone&#x27;s kick rebounded out off the post, hit goalkeeper Carlos&#x27;s back, and subsequently bounced into the goal. Referee Ioan Igna gave the goal to France, and Brazil captain Edinho was booked for protesting that the kick should have been considered a miss as soon as it rebounded off the post. In 1987, the International Football Association Board clarified Law 14, covering penalty kicks, to support Igna&#x27;s decision.
# Teams take turns to kick from the penalty mark, until each has taken five kicks. However, if one side has scored more goals than the other could possibly reach with all of its remaining kicks, the shoot-out immediately ends, regardless of the number of kicks remaining; this basis is called &quot;best-of-five kicks&quot;. In the 2006 World Cup final, for example, the shoot-out ended after Italy&#x27;s Fabio Grosso had scored his team&#x27;s fifth, despite the fact that France (on three) still had one more shot to take. Similarly, in the 2022 FIFA World Cup Final, Gonzalo Montiel&#x27;s successful conversion of Argentina&#x27;s fourth kick won the trophy, despite France and Argentina both having one kick left.
# If after five rounds of kicks, the teams have scored an equal number of goals (or neither team has scored any goals), additional rounds of one kick each are used until one team scores and the other misses. This is known as sudden death.
# The team that scores the most goals at the end of the shoot-out is the winner of the match.
# Only players who were on the pitch at the end of play or temporarily absent (injured, adjusting equipment etc.) are allowed to participate in the shoot-out. If at the end of the match and before or during the kicks one side has more players on the pitch than the other, whether as a result of injury or red cards, then the side with more players must reduce its numbers to match the opponents; this is known as &quot;reduce to equate&quot;. For example, if Team A has eleven players but Team B only has ten, then Team A chooses one player to exclude. Players excluded this way may take no further part in the procedure, either as kicker or goalkeeper, except that they can be used to replace a goalkeeper who becomes injured during the shootout. The rule was introduced by the International Football Association Board in February 2000 because previously an eleventh kick would be taken by the eleventh (i.e. weakest) player of a full-strength team and the first (i.e. strongest) player of a sub-strength team. A rule change in 2016 eliminated the possibility of a team gaining such an advantage if a player is injured or sent off &quot;during&quot; the shoot-out.
# A team may replace a goalkeeper who becomes injured during the shoot-out with a substitute (provided the team has not already used the maximum number of substitutes allowed by the competition) or by a player previously excluded under the &#x27;reduce to equate&#x27; provision.
# If a goalkeeper is sent off during the shoot-out, another player who finished the game must act as goalkeeper.
# If a player, other than the goalkeeper, becomes injured or is sent off during the shoot-out, then the shoot-out continues with no substitution allowed. The opposing team must reduce its numbers accordingly.
# Any player remaining on the pitch may act as the goalkeeper, and it is &quot;not&quot; required for the same player to have acted as a goalkeeper during the game.
# No player is allowed to take a second kick until all other eligible players on their team have taken a first kick, including the goalkeeper.
# If it becomes necessary for players to take another kick (because the score has remained equal after all eligible players have taken their first kick), players are not required to kick in the same order.
# Kicks from the penalty mark must not be delayed for a player who leaves the field of play. The player&#x27;s kick is forfeited (not scored) if the player does not return in time to take a kick.
# The referee must not abandon the match if, during the kicks, a team is reduced to fewer than seven players.

==Tactics==

Defending against a penalty kick is one of the most difficult tasks a goalkeeper can face. Some decide which way they will dive beforehand, giving themselves time to reach the side of the goalmouth. A 2011 study published in the journal &quot;Psychological Science&quot; found goalkeepers dived to the right 71% of the time when their team was losing, but only 48% when ahead and 49% when tied, a phenomenon believed to be related to certain right-preferring behaviour in social mammals. Others try to read the kicker&#x27;s motion pattern. Kickers may attempt to feint, or delay their shot to see which way the keeper dives. Shooting high and centre, in the space that the keeper will evacuate, carries the highest risk of shooting above the bar. If a keeper blocks a penalty kick during a match, there is a danger the kicker or a teammate may score from the rebound; this is not relevant in the case of a shoot-out.

Since the entire shoot-out is conducted at the same goal, the crowd behind the goal may favour one team and try to distract the other team&#x27;s shooters. To forestall any potential advantage, in 2016 the Laws of the Game were modified to add a coin toss between the two teams prior to the shoot-out: the winner of the coin toss has the right to decide which goal is used for the shoot-out (previously, the decision was at the referee&#x27;s discretion). The referee may change the goal only for safety reasons or if the selected goal or pitch are unusable.

A goalkeeper may not use distracting gamesmanship such as cleaning their boots or asking the referee to see if the ball is placed properly; this risks a caution for unsporting conduct. Bruce Grobbelaar&#x27;s &quot;wobbly legs&quot; clowning distracted Francesco Graziani in the 1984 European Cup Final shootout. The keeper is forbidden from moving off the goal line to narrow the shooter&#x27;s angle; the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final shootout caused controversy as replays showed that both keepers got away with this, as did Jerzy Dudek in the 2005 Champions League Final.

==History==
===Origins===
Between 1867 and 1970, the laws of association football did not provide for a method of breaking ties. The first association football tournament, the FA Cup, used extra time and replays to decide drawn games. This example was followed by other early knockout competitions.
In the early 1920s, some charity matches began using corner-kicks as a tie-breaker in order to avoid replays. In response, the laws of the game were amended in 1923 to state explicitly that the goal was the only means of scoring, and that a match that ended with equal number of goals scored was drawn.

In major competitions, when a replay or playoff was not possible, ties were previously broken by drawing of lots. Examples include Italy&#x27;s win over the USSR in the semi-final of the 1968 European Championship (the final, also drawn, went to a replay).
However, variants of the modern shoot-out were used before then in several domestic competitions and minor tournaments. Domestic examples include the Yugoslav Cup from 1952, the Coppa Italia from 1958 to 1959, and the Swiss inter-regional Youth Cup from 1959 to 1960. International examples include the 1962 Uhrencup (at the suggestion of its founder Kurt Weissbrodt),
the final of the 1962 Ramón de Carranza Trophy (at the suggestion of journalist Rafael Ballester), and a silver medal playoff match between amateur teams representing Venezuela and Bolivia in the 1965 Bolivarian Games. Pavllo Bukoviku took and scored all KS Besa&#x27;s kicks in a 5–2 shootout win in the 1963 Albanian Cup Final, a format devised by Anton Mazreku, the Albanian FA president.

Israeli Yosef Dagan is credited with originating the modern shoot-out, after watching the Israeli team lose a 1968 Olympic quarter-final game against Bulgaria by drawing of lots in Mexico. Michael Almog, later president of the Israel Football Association, described Dagan&#x27;s proposal in a letter published in &quot;FIFA News&quot; in August 1969. Koe Ewe Teik, the FA Malaysia&#x27;s member of the referee&#x27;s committee, led the move for its adoption by FIFA. FIFA&#x27;s proposal was discussed on 20 February 1970 by a working party of the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which recommended its acceptance, although &quot;not entirely satisfied&quot; with it. It was adopted at IFAB&#x27;s annual general meeting on 27 June 1970. In 2006, Deutsche Presse-Agentur reported a claim by former referee Karl Wald from Frankfurt am Main, that he had first proposed the shoot-out in 1970 to the Bavarian FA.

The adoption of the penalty shoot-out by IFAB came too late for the 1970 World Cup, whose rules still prescribed drawing of lots for any knockout match other than the final which ended drawn after extra-time (FIFA refused to announce in advance what would happen if the final itself ended up drawn). The technical report for the 1970 tournament recommended that drawing of lots should be abandoned in future tournaments, noting that &quot;this suggestion has, however, since been cut across by the decision of the International Board as to the taking of penalty kicks to resolve such a deadlock situation.&quot; In the event, drawing of lots was never required to decide the winner of a knockout match in any World Cup finals, although it was used in a 1969 qualification tie when Morocco advanced at the expense of Tunisia.

===Development===

In England, the first penalty shoot-out in a professional match took place in 1970 at Boothferry Park, Hull, between Hull City and Manchester United during the semi-final of the Watney Cup, and was won by Manchester United. The first player to take a kick was George Best, and the first to miss was Denis Law. Ian McKechnie, who saved Law&#x27;s kick, was also the first goalkeeper to take a kick; his shot hit the crossbar and deflected over, putting Hull City out of the Cup.

Penalty shoot-outs were used to decide matches in UEFA&#x27;s European Cup and Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in the 1970–71 season. On 30 September 1970, after a 4–4 aggregate draw in the first round of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, Honvéd won the first shoot-out 5–4 against Aberdeen, when Jim Forrest&#x27;s shot hit the bar. Five weeks later, on 4 November 1970, the first ever European Cup shoot out took place between Everton F.C. and Borussia Mönchengladbach, with the side from England this time being the winners 4–3.

A friendly cup game between the Barcelona women&#x27;s team and UE Centelles went to penalty shoot-out in December 1970. The format of this shoot-out had penalty kicks taken in sets of three, with Barcelona kicking three, then Centelles kicking three. After two rounds of this continued to produce matching results, the shoot-out was taken to sudden death.

In the first round of the European Cup 1972–73, the referee prematurely ended a shoot-out between CSKA Sofia and Panathinaikos, with CSKA leading 3–2 but Panathinaikos having taken only four kicks. Panathinaikos complained to UEFA and the match was annulled and replayed the following month, with CSKA winning without the need for a shoot-out.

The final of the 1973 Campeonato Paulista ended in similar circumstances. Santos were leading Portuguesa 2–0 with each team having taken three shoot-out kicks, when referee Armando Marques mistakenly (as each team still had two shots to take, and therefore Portuguesa still had a chance of levelling the scoreline) declared Santos the winners. Portuguesa manager Otto Glória quickly led his team out of the stadium; this was allegedly to ensure the shoot-out could not resume once the mistake was discovered, and that instead the match would be replayed, giving Portuguesa a better chance of victory. When Santos counter-objected to a replay, Paulista FA president Osvaldo Teixeira Duarte annulled the original match and declared both teams joint champions.

The first major international tournament to be decided by a penalty shoot-out was the 1976 European Championship final between Czechoslovakia and West Germany. UEFA had made provision for a final replay two days later, but the teams decided to use a shoot-out instead. Czechoslovakia won the shootout 5–3, with the deciding kick being converted by Antonín Panenka with a &quot;chip&quot; after Uli Hoeneß had put the previous kick over the crossbar.

The first penalty shoot-out in the World Cup was on 9 January 1977, in the first round of African qualifying, when Tunisia beat Morocco. The first shoot-out in the finals tournament was in 1982, when West Germany beat France in the semifinal. If the 1982 final had been drawn, penalties would not have applied unless the replay was also drawn; from 1986, penalties were scheduled after the final as for the earlier knockout rounds.

==Famous incidents==
===Internationals===
The finals of nine FIFA 11-a-side tournaments, including three men&#x27;s World Cups, have gone to penalty shoot-outs. Some of the notable matches are as follows.
*The 1991 FIFA World Youth Championship final between Portugal and Brazil in Lisbon was decided on a penalty shoot-out which the Portuguese won 4–2, with the last shot coming from Rui Costa.
*In the 1994 FIFA World Cup final at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, the match between Brazil and Italy ended goalless after extra time. Brazil went on to win the shoot-out 3–2.
*In the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup Final, also held at the Rose Bowl, the match between hosts the United States and China ended goalless after extra time as well. The United States went on to win the shoot-out 5–4, becoming the first host country to win the tournament.
*The 2006 FIFA World Cup final between France and Italy also went to a penalty shoot-out (after a 1–1 draw followed by a scoreless 30 minutes of extra time) and was won by Italy 5–3 against France in Berlin&#x27;s Olympic Stadium.
*In the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup final, held at Waldstadion in Frankfurt, the match between the United States and Japan ended 2–2 after extra time. This time, the United States ended up on the losing side. Japan won the shoot-out 3–1, thus becoming the first Asian country to win the senior—either men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s—World Cup.
*The 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup final in Istanbul went to a penalty shoot-out after a 0–0 draw after extra time. France won 4–1 over Uruguay. It was their first U-20 World Cup title, thus became the first nation to win all five FIFA 11-a-side men&#x27;s titles (FIFA World Cup, FIFA Confederations Cup, FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, and the Olympic football tournament).
*The 2022 FIFA World Cup final between France and Argentina went to penalty shoot-out after the extra time ended with a 3–3 draw. Argentina won 4–2 against France in shoot-out to lift the World Cup trophy for the first time since 1986.

The first penalty shoot-out in a World Cup match was in the dramatic West Germany vs France semi-final match in 1982. After the penalty shoot-out ended equal, it went into sudden death.

Goalkeepers have been known to win shoot-outs by their kicking. For example, in a UEFA Euro 2004 quarter-final match, Portugal goalkeeper Ricardo saved a kick (without gloves) from England&#x27;s Darius Vassell and then scored the winning shot. Another example is Vélez Sársfield&#x27;s José Luis Chilavert in the 1994 Copa Libertadores Finals. (Chilavert had a reputation as a dead-ball specialist and scored 41 goals during his club career.). More recently, in the 2023 African Cup of Nations, DR Congo&#x27;s Lionel Mpasi shot the ball into the top right-hand corner against Mohamed Gabaski, who had been a penalty-saving specialist in Egypt&#x27;s run to the final in Cameroon two years prior.

Antonín Panenka (Czechoslovakia) decided the penalty shoot-out at the UEFA Euro 1976 Final against West Germany with a famous chip to the middle of the goal.

The England national team has lost seven (out of ten) penalty shoot-outs in major tournament finals, including losses to Germany in the semi-finals of the 1990 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 1996 (the latter following a win over Spain by the same method in the previous round). After Euro 1996, England lost four more shoot-outs in a row in major tournament finals, losing to Argentina at the 1998 World Cup, Portugal at Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup and Italy at Euro 2012, before finally breaking their losing streak at the 2018 World Cup against Colombia; this shoot-out also allowed England to progress into the quarter-finals for the first time in twelve years. England again lost a penalty shoot-out to Italy in the UEFA Euro 2020 Final. They won their following penalty shootout against Switzerland in the UEFA Euro 2024 Quarter Finals.

The Netherlands, meanwhile, lost four consecutive shoot-outs: against Denmark in Euro 1992, France in Euro 1996, Brazil in the 1998 World Cup, and Italy in Euro 2000, before finally winning one against Sweden in Euro 2004. In Euro 2000, the Netherlands had two penalty kicks during the match and four attempts in the shoot-out but only managed to convert one kick against Italian keeper Francesco Toldo. Frank de Boer had both a penalty kick and shoot-out kick saved by Toldo, who also saved from Paul Bosvelt to give Italy a 3–1 shoot-out victory. The Netherlands&#x27; fortunes seemed to improve during the 2014 World Cup, when they defeated Costa Rica on penalty kicks in their quarter-final match, only to lose their semi-final match against Argentina on penalties. The 2022 World Cup saw their losing a shoot-out against Argentina once again, but this time in the quarter-finals.

The Italians have lost six shoot-outs in major championships, notably being eliminated on penalties from three consecutive World Cups (1990–1998, including the 1994 final), the Euro 2008 quarter-finals, and the Euro 2016 quarter-finals. However, they have also won five shoot-outs, including the Euro 2000 semi-final against the Netherlands, the Euro 2012 quarter-final against England, the 2006 World Cup final against France, the Euro 2020 semi-final against Spain, and the Euro 2020 final against England.

On 16 November 2005, a place in the World Cup was directly determined by a penalty shoot-out for the first time. The 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying playoff between Australia and Uruguay ended 1–1 on aggregate; Uruguay won the first leg 1–0 at home, and Australia won the second leg at home by the same score. A scoreless 30 minutes of extra time were followed by a shoot-out, which Australia won 4–2. This occurred again twice in qualifying matches for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, first on 29 March 2022 in the CAF third round between Egypt and Senegal, which Senegal won 3–1 on penalties after the two legs ended 1–1 on aggregate, and on 13 June 2022 in the AFC-CONMEBOL qualifying playoff between Australia and Peru, which Australia won 5–4 on penalties after the only fixture in the playoff went to a 0–0 draw. Delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic caused only one match to be played in neutral Qatar, rather than the traditional home-and-away playoff fixture.

During the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, Switzerland set an unwanted new record in the round of 16 shoot-out against Ukraine by failing to convert any of their penalties, losing 3–0. The goalkeeper Oleksandr Shovkovskyi (Ukraine) became the first not to concede a single goal in the penalty shoot-out, saving two of the Swiss attempts, with another shot hitting the crossbar. The result meant that Switzerland became the first nation to be eliminated from the World Cup without conceding any goals (and, moreover, the only nation to participate in a World Cup finals tournament without conceding a goal). Despite this loss, Switzerland beat France 5–4 on penalties in the Euro 2020 round of 16.

The same competition featured a shoot-out between Germany and Argentina, the two most successful teams up to that point in terms of World Cup finals penalty shoot-outs: Each team had competed in three shoot-outs and won all of them. Germany won the shoot-out, leaving Germany alone with a 4–0 record in World Cup finals.

On 20 June 2007, a new UEFA record was established. The semi-final of the European Under-21 Championships in Heerenveen between the Netherlands and England team finished 1–1, and thirty-two penalties were taken before the tie was broken. The Netherlands eventually won the shoot-out 13–12.

===Domestic cups===
In the FA Cup, penalty kicks were used in the 1972 edition of the short-lived third-place playoff. They were introduced more generally in the 1991–92 season to decide matches still level after one replay and extra time. Previously there was no limit on the number of replays, which led to fixture disruption, especially disliked by the top clubs. Replays were often two or three days after the drawn match, which conflicted with the increased planning required after the Football Spectators Act 1989. The first team eliminated from the FA Cup on penalties was Scunthorpe United, beaten on 26 October 1991 by Rotherham United after a first-round replay. A shoot-out was first used in the FA Cup Final in 2005, when Arsenal beat Manchester United 5–4. The following year, Liverpool beat West Ham United in the FA Cup Final&#x27;s second ever penalty shoot-out.

On 31 August 2005, a new English record was established when a shoot-out between Tunbridge Wells and Littlehampton Town in an FA Cup replay involved 40 kicks being taken, with Tunbridge Wells winning 16–15.

Shoot-outs have been used to settle six Football League Cup finals to date. The first was in 2001 when Liverpool beat Birmingham City 5–4 on penalties after a 1–1 draw after extra time in the match. The second was the 2009 final between Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur ended goalless and was won 4–1 on penalties by Manchester United. Then the 2012 final between Liverpool and Cardiff City finished 2–2 after extra time, Liverpool winning 3–2 on penalties. The 2016 final was won by Manchester City beating Liverpool 3–1 on penalties, after a 1–1 draw. Manchester City also won the 2019 final 4–3 on penalties after a 0–0 draw with Chelsea. Chelsea then went on to lose the 2022 final 11–10 on penalties to Liverpool.

Penalty shoot-outs have been used for many years to settle drawn games in the earlier rounds of the Football League Cup, the earliest example being August 1976 when Doncaster Rovers beat Lincoln City 3–2 on penalties after three drawn games in a row (1–1, 1–1, 2–2) in a first round match. Shoot-outs tend to be quite rare in the semi-finals due to the away goals rule applying after extra time. However, a shoot-out was used in the 2013–14 semi-final between Sunderland and Manchester United after both teams finished level over two legs; Sunderland won the shoot-out 2–1.

The Community Shield is also settled using penalties, following the normal 90 minutes of play, but no extra time. Manchester United have won the shield three times via a shoot-out, beating Arsenal in 2003, Chelsea in 2007, and Portsmouth in 2008. Manchester United lost the 2009 match on penalties to Chelsea.

In 2008, the Turkish Cup Final featured two clubs outside of Istanbul&#x27;s Top Three for the first time in two decades, but penalty kicks decided the winner between Gençlerbirliği and Kayserispor, the latter having reached the final for the first time ever. After a scoreless 120 minutes, 28 penalty kicks were needed to decide the outcome, and Kayserispor, thanks to the goal scoring and goal saving heroics of Dimitar Ivankov, won its first Turkish Cup 11–10.

In the 2008–09 Greek Cup final AEK took a 3–2 lead at 89&#x27; with a goal by Scocco; however Olympiacos came back from the dead at the dying seconds of stoppage time (90&#x27;+6) with a goal by Derbyshire, to force an overtime. While Olympiacos took a 4–3 lead in overtime with a goal by Galletti, the scorer was sent off with a second yellow card for taking his shirt off while celebrating. Later on, Avraam Papadopoulos also got a second yellow leaving Olympiacos with 9 players. AEK managed to tie the game at 4–4 forcing a penalty shoot out.

AEK was shooting first. Both AEK and Olympiacos scored in the first 4 penalties. Majstorovic of AEK hit the horizontal crossbar in the 5th penalty giving the chance to Djordjevic (for whom it was the closing game of his career) to seal the victory for Olympiacos. However, his shot was blocked by AEK&#x27;s Argentinian goalkeeper Saja. Hence, the shooting continued. Both teams scored their 6th and 7th penalties. Center-back Antzas was slotted to hit the 8th penalty for Olympiacos, but keeper Nikopolidis took the initiative and took the penalty instead tying the score to 7–7. Nikopolidis blocked the subsequent (9th) penalty by Georgeas for AEK but Antzas missed the penalty for Olympiacos (saved by Saha) and failed to finish the shoot-out.

Since Olympiacos had only 9 players in the field, the shooters had to rotate, going back to those that shoot the very first penalties. All 7 subsequent penalty takers for both teams scored, leading to a penalty shoot out that was at 14–14 with 32 penalty shots having been taken. However, Pelletieri of AEK had a bad penalty shot that was easily deflected by Nikopolidis, who then took the 34th penalty shot against the other goalkeeper, Saja, scoring, and ending this saga with a 15–14 win for Olympiacos in penalty shoot out and an overall score of 19–18. (2008–09 Greek Cup).

===UEFA club competitions===
The first penalty shoot-out in a European Cup final occurred in the 1984 European Cup Final as Liverpool defeated Roma. The match is best known for the antics of Liverpool keeper Bruce Grobbelaar. As Roma&#x27;s Bruno Conti prepared to take his kick, Grobbelaar walked towards the goal smiling confidently at the cameras lined-up behind, then proceeded to bite the back of the net, in imitation of eating spaghetti. Conti sent his spot kick over the bar. Grobbelaar then produced a similar performance before Francesco Graziani took his kick, famously wobbling his legs in mock terror. Graziani duly missed and Liverpool went on to win the shootout 4–2.

In the 1986 European Cup Final between Steaua București and Barcelona, Steaua keeper Helmut Duckadam saved all four of Barca&#x27;s penalties, for which he was dubbed &quot;the hero of Seville&quot;. Steaua also missed two, but still prevailed 2–0 in the shoot-out to become the only Romanian club side to win the title.

In the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final the penalty-shoot out has caused controversy among many fans as replays showed that Milan goalkeeper Dida was off his goal line when saving penalties from Trezeguet, Zalayeta and Montero. Juventus keeper Buffon was also off his goal line when saving penalties from Seedorf and Kaladze.

In the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final between Milan and Liverpool, Liverpool keeper Jerzy Dudek used tactics similar to Bruce Grobbelaar in 1984 (known as the &quot;Dudek dance&quot; in 2005) to distract the Milan shootout takers which resulted in a victory for his team.

The 2008 UEFA Champions League Final between Manchester United and Chelsea went to penalties, when John Terry missed a penalty which would have won Chelsea the match (and the Champions League). His standing leg slipped as he took his kick, and the ball hit the post. Chelsea lost the shoot-out 6–5, to which Terry reacted by breaking down in tears. Terry was not originally the penalty taker, however, striker Didier Drogba had been sent off shortly before extra time ended.

In the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, Iker Casillas and Manuel Neuer each saved two spot kicks. Neuer kept out penalties from Cristiano Ronaldo (£80 million) and Kaká (£56 million), then the most expensive footballers in history from their transfer fees.

On 19 May 2012, Chelsea defeated Bayern Munich 4–3 on penalties in the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final. Chelsea had never previously won a shoot-out in the competition, and had lost the 2008 final and 2007 semi-final on penalties. Bayern had never lost a shoot-out in Europe; their wins included the 2001 final against Valencia and the 2012 semi-final against Real Madrid. Didier Drogba dispatched the winning penalty, having been unable to take the fifth kick (missed by Terry) in the 2008 final due to a red card in extra time. The following day, many British newspapers made reference to the fact that an English team had finally beaten a German team on penalties.

On 26 May 2021, Villarreal defeated Manchester United 11–10 on penalties in the 2021 UEFA Europa League Final, after the game ended 1–1 after extra time. Every player on the pitch took penalties – Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea was the only one to miss, with his shot being saved by Gerónimo Rulli to hand Villarreal its first major title. The 21 penalties converted was a record for a shoot-out in a major UEFA tournament match.

===Records===

The world record for the longest penalty shoot-out, and the highest score, in a first class match is 56 penalties during the 2023–24 Liga Alef (Israel&#x27;s third tier) promotion play-offs when F.C. Dimona beat Shimshon Tel Aviv 23–22.

The world record for the most penalties scored consecutively in a shoot out stands at 31, in a Vertu Trophy Round of 32 game between Blackpool and Aston Villa U21&#x27;s on 17th December 2024, in which the 32nd penalty was saved, enabling Aston Villa to win 18-17. 

In major international tournaments, the most penalties came in the 2006 African Cup of Nations, where Ivory Coast and Cameroon needed 24 penalties to decide who would advance to the semi-finals. The Ivory Coast advanced by winning 12–11 after Samuel Eto&#x27;o missed his second attempt, as his was the only miss of the penalty shootout. Ivory Coast also participated in the longest shootout in a final, in the 1992 African Cup of Nations, where they beat Ghana 11-10. This penalty shootout was significant in that it was the first in the final of a major international tournament that every player on the pitch took a penalty.

The longest FIFA World Cup penalty shoot-out, male or female, occurred in the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup knockout stage match between Australia and France; the shoot-out saw 20 penalties taken, with Australia ultimately prevailing 7–6.

On 11 December 2012, Bradford City set the record for most consecutive penalty shootout wins. They won 9 penalty shootouts since 2009 and that included wins against Arsenal and local rivals Huddersfield Town.

The shortest possible penalty shootout consists of three kicks by each team, with one team scoring all its kicks and the other team failing to score any. An example of this occurred in the semi-final of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, with Chile beating Portugal 3–0, or the UEFA Euro 2024 where Portugal beat Slovenia with the same result in the shootout.

==Statistical record==
A shoot-out is usually considered for statistical purposes to be separate from the match which preceded it. In the case of a two-legged fixture, the two matches are still considered either as two draws or as one win and one loss; in the case of a single match, it is still considered as a draw. This contrasts with a fixture won in extra time, where the score at the end of normal time is superseded. Converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for &quot;golden boot&quot; competitions.

The NCAA rules book, which governs most college soccer in the United States, takes a similar approach. With the exception of the national championship game, if the score of any game remains tied following the sudden death overtime (or golden goal), the game is recorded as a tie, regardless of the result of the shoot-out tiebreaker. In a national championship game, the result of the shoot-out tiebreaker also determines the result of the game for statistical purposes. Until 2001, all NCAA games in which the shoot-out tiebreaker was used to determine advancement or a champion were recorded as a tie. In 2002, the rule was modified such that all games in which the shoot-out tiebreaker was used would also decide the winner of the game for statistical purposes. The rule was again changed in 2003 to match the pre-2002 rule with the newly added exception that a shoot-out tiebreaker in a national championship game would be decisive for all purposes, including the record.

In the calculation of UEFA coefficients, shoot-outs are ignored for club coefficients, but not national team coefficients, where the shoot-out winner gets 20,000 points: more than the shoot-out loser, who gets 10,000 (the same as for a draw) but less than the 30,000 points for winning a match outright. In the FIFA World Rankings, the base value of a win is three points; a win on penalties is two; a draw and a loss on penalties are one; a loss is zero. The more complicated ranking system FIFA used from 1999 to 2006 gave a shoot-out winner the same points as for a normal win and a shoot-out loser the same points as for a draw; goals in the match proper, but not the shoot-out, were factored into the calculation.

==Criticisms==
As a way to decide a football match, shoot-outs have been seen variously as a thrilling climax or as an unsatisfactory cop-out.

Paul Doyle describes shoot-outs as &quot;exciting and suspense-filled&quot; and the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final shoot-out as &quot;the perfect way to end a wonderful ... final&quot;. Richard Williams compares the spectacle to &quot;a public flogging in the market square&quot;.

The result is often seen as a lottery rather than a test of skill; managers Luiz Felipe Scolari and Roberto Donadoni described them as such after their teams had respectively won and lost shoot-outs. Others disagree. Mitch Phillips called it &quot;the ultimate test of nerve and technique&quot;. Paul Doyle emphasised the psychological element.

Only a small subset of a footballer&#x27;s skills is tested by a shoot-out. Ian Thomsen likened deciding the 1994 World Cup using a penalty shoot-out to deciding the Masters golf tournament via a minigolf game. The shoot-out is a test of individuals which may be considered inappropriate in a team sport; Sepp Blatter has said &quot;Football is a team sport and penalties is not a team, it is the individual&quot;.

Inferior teams are tempted to play for a scoreless draw, calculating that a shoot-out offers their best hope of victory. Red Star Belgrade&#x27;s performance beating Olympique Marseille in the 1991 European Cup Final is often condemned for having &quot;played for penalties&quot; from the kick-off; a tactic coach Ljupko Petrović freely admitted to. On the other hand, the increased opportunity for giant-killing may also be seen as an advantage, increasing the romance of a competition like the FA Cup. Some teams have regarded, or been accused of regarding, a loss on penalties as an honourable result or &quot;no defeat at all&quot;.

&quot;The Economist&quot; reported on the advantage of the team kicking first usually winning and on the players aiming higher usually scoring a goal.

===Advantage to team kicking first?===
Ignacio Palacios-Huerta has suggested that the alternating kick sequence gives an unfair advantage to the team kicking first, with statistical evidence showing that the team kicking first wins in 60% of the cases, probably because the team kicking second is under more pressure when trailing in the shoot-out. As a remedy, he proposed using the Thue–Morse sequence to determine the kicking order. Another, more comprehensive, analysis by InStat looked at over 2,000 penalty kick shootouts the first to go won 51.48% of the time. However, in the academic literature, empirical support for the existence of such a first-mover advantage is ambiguous. For instance, an extensive study conducted in 2024 found no first-mover advantage in modern European football.

As part of a trial to reduce a potential first-mover advantage, the IFAB sanctioned in March 2017 to test a different sequence of taking penalties, known as &quot;ABBA&quot;, that mirrors the serving sequence in a tennis tiebreak (team A kicks first, team B kicks second):
;Original sequence
:AB AB AB AB AB (sudden death starts) AB AB AB etc.
;Trial sequence
:AB BA AB BA AB (sudden death starts) BA AB BA etc.

The trial was initially scheduled at the 2017 UEFA European Under-17 Championship and the 2017 UEFA Women&#x27;s Under-17 Championship in May 2017 if a penalty shoot-out would be needed. The trial was extended in June 2017 to include the 2017 UEFA European Under-19 Championship and the 2017 UEFA Women&#x27;s Under-19 Championship.

The penalty shoot-out in the Women&#x27;s Under-17 Championship semi-final between Germany and Norway was the first ever to implement this new system. It was also used in the 2017 FA Community Shield on 6 August 2017.

During IFAB&#x27;s 133rd Annual Business Meeting in Glasgow, Scotland on 22 November 2018, it was agreed that due to the lack of strong support mainly because of its complexity, the ABBA option would no longer be used in future competitions.

==Alternatives==
Other tie-break methods have been proposed, both before and since shoot-outs were introduced.

Association football used the &quot;touch down&quot; (similar to a try in rugby) between 1866 and 1867. The touch-down was related to similar tie-breakers used in non-association football codes, such as the &quot;rouge&quot; in the Eton field game (and, from 1862 to 1868, in Sheffield Rules). In rugby itself, the try served as a tie-breaker between 1875 and 1886.

A drawn result may be allowed to stand, unless the fixture determines which team qualifies for a later round. Before 1993 (except in 1974) the FA Charity Shield was shared if the match was drawn. When the third place playoff of the 1972 Olympic tournament between the Soviets and East Germany ended 2–2 after extra time, the bronze medal was shared by the two teams.

During the qualification process for the 1962 World Cup, Morocco and Tunisia formed a two-team group. They both won 2–1 at home, so they played the third match at a neutral location. When this ended in a 1–1 draw after extra time, Morocco advanced on a coin toss to the next round of qualification. This scenario was repeated during the qualification process for the 1970 World Cup, when the same two teams were tied after three matches and extra time. Again, Morocco advanced on a coin toss. Tunisia did have better luck with the coin toss in the intervening years; during the 1965 African Cup of Nations, they reached the final at the expense of Senegal by winning a coin toss after three group matches had left Tunisia and Senegal tied with a win (over Ethiopia) and a draw (against each other).

Alternatives include replaying a match that has ended in a draw. In the 1974 European Cup final, the final score of the first match was a draw, leading to a replay being played two days later. This remains the only time it has happened in the competition. Replays still occur up to, and including, the fifth round (last 16) of the English FA Cup. Until 1991, any number of replays were permitted, with a record of five. (Since then, a draw in the [first] replay has been resolved by a penalty-shoot-out.) However, it was announced in April 2024 that replays would be scrapped from the first round onwards beginning with the 2024-2025 FA Cup season. 

Other suggestions have included using elements of match play such as most shots on goal, most corner kicks awarded, fewest cautions and sendings-off, or having ongoing extra time with teams compelled to remove players at progressive intervals (similar to regular season play in the National Hockey League, where players play 3-on-3 in the extra time). These proposals have not yet been authorised by the International Football Association Board. However, after the 2006 World Cup, Sepp Blatter stated that he wants no more penalty shoot-outs in the Final of the World Cup, tentatively suggesting either a replay or &quot;Maybe to take players away and play golden goal&quot;.

Henry Birtles&#x27; &quot;Advantage&quot; proposal is for the shoot-out to be held before extra-time, and only acting as a tiebreak if the game remains a draw after the full 120 minutes. Proponents of this idea state that it would lead to a more offensive extra-time as one of the teams would know they have to score and there would never be a match in which both teams are simply waiting for penalties. Another advantage is that players who have missed would have a chance to redeem themselves in extra-time. The obvious flaw is that the team that wins the penalty shoot-out would be inclined to play defensively in extra time in the knowledge that a draw would put them through. However, this flaw is not so clear because a single goal makes the difference between winning and losing, as opposed to a team that defends a single-goal lead more comfortably because a conceded goal is the difference between winning and drawing.

Another alternative is Attacker Defender Goalkeeper (ADG), which features a series of ten contests, in which an attacker kicks off from 32 yards and has 20 seconds to score a goal against a defender and goalkeeper. At the completion of the ten contests, the team with the most goals is the winner.

==North American experiments==
The North American Soccer League (NASL) in the 1970s and 1980s, then Major League Soccer (MLS) for its first four seasons (1996–1999) experimented with a variation of the shoot-out procedure.

Instead of a straight penalty kick, the shoot-out started from the goal and having five seconds to attempt a shot. The player could make as many moves as he could in a breakaway situation in the five seconds, then attempt a shot. This procedure is similar to that used in an ice hockey penalty shot. As with a standard shoot-out, this variation used a best-of-five-kicks model, and if the score was still level, the tiebreaker would head to an extra round of one attempt per team.

This format rewarded player skills, as players were able to attempt to deceive goalkeepers and play the ball in an attempt to make the shot, as in a one-on-one skills contest, and goalkeepers could take on the attackers without restrictions that are normally implemented in penalty shootouts. Soccer Bowl &#x27;81, the NASL&#x27;s 1981 championship final, was decided by this format.

From its inception in 1968, the NASL used an unconventional point system in determining the league standings. Teams were awarded six points for a win and three points for a draw. In addition, teams earned one bonus point for each goal scored in a game up to a maximum of three per game. Thus, a team that lost 5–3 would earn three points. However, a team that lost 1–0 would earn no points. Also, a team that won 5–4 would earn nine points (the same as a 3–0 win). But a team that won 2–0 would earn only eight points. In the league&#x27;s second season (1969), the Kansas City Spurs were the league champions with 10 wins, 2 losses and 4 ties even though the Atlanta Chiefs had 11 wins, 2 losses and 3 ties, because Kansas City earned more bonus points. Starting with 1971 postseason playoff matches, the NASL used a golden goal rule, and every match had a winner decided from the run of play. Extra-time sessions were 15 minutes long before a brief break and change of ends. Game 1 of the 1971 NASL semifinal series between the Rochester Lancers and the Dallas Tornado went six extra-time periods with Rochester scoring the game-winning goal in the 176th minute. Game 3 of that same series went four extra time periods with Dallas scoring in the 148th minute to win the match and the series. In 1975, the NASL adopted a conventional penalty-kick shootout system for all regular-season and postseason playoff matches, and there were no longer any NASL matches that ended in ties. In the standings, a team that won in regulation time was awarded six points. A team that won in a penalty-kick shootout was awarded one point. Bonus points continued to be awarded for each goal scored up to a maximum of three per game. In 1977, the NASL adopted the experimental North American shootout procedure described above. If a match was tied after 90 minutes, a maximum of two golden goal extra time periods of 7.5 minutes each were played. If neither team scored, the shootout was held to determine the winner of the match. In the standings, a team that won was awarded six points whether the win came in regulation time, extra time or by shootout. Bonus points continued to be awarded for each goal scored up to a maximum of three per game. No bonus points were awarded for goals scored in extra time. Postseason playoff games were decided in the same manner. In 1981, the number of points awarded to a team that won a game in a shootout was reduced from six to four. This remained the system until the NASL&#x27;s final season in 1984.

From its inception in 1996, MLS used the shootout system that had been used by the NASL to determine winners of matches. No regular-season or postseason playoff games ended in a tie. In general, no extra time was played; the shootout commenced immediately after 90 minutes had been played. The only exception was in the MLS Cup Final in which a match tied after 90 minutes would be followed by a maximum of two 15-minute extra time sessions on a golden goal basis. In the regular-season standings, a team that won a match in regulation was awarded three points. A team that won a match in a shootout was awarded one point. There were no bonus points or points awarded to teams that lost whether in regulation time or a shootout. In the playoffs, the conference semifinals and conference finals were organised as best-of-three matches series. A shootout win counted as a win. Thus, a team could win two of the three matches by shootout and lose the other match in regulation and still advance to the next round. This was inconsistent with how the teams were rewarded during the regular season when the team with one win would have earned three points, and the team with two wins would have earned only two points. In 1999, a maximum of two 15-minute golden goal extra time periods were added for matches that were tied after 90 minutes of regulation play. If neither team scored during extra time, the match was decided by a shootout. MLS abandoned the North American style shootout starting with the 2000 season. If penalties are required to determine a winner during the playoffs, MLS now uses the shoot-out procedure specified by the International Football Association Board.

In the MLS Next Pro development league, all draws are followed by a penalty shoot out. While both teams receive 1 match point for the draw, the team winning the penalty shootout gets an additional match point, resulting in draws giving 1 point to the loser of the shootout and 2 to the winner.

<text>The Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth (branded as Dartmouth Engineering) is the engineering school of Dartmouth College, a private research university in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States.

Located in a three-building complex along the Connecticut River on Dartmouth&#x27;s campus, Dartmouth Engineering offers undergraduate, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees in engineering sciences, and has partnerships with other liberal arts colleges throughout the United States to offer dual degrees. The school was established in 1867 with funds from Dartmouth alumnus Sylvanus Thayer, also known for his work in establishing the engineering curriculum at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.

In 2016, Dartmouth Engineering became one of the first comprehensive, national research university in the US, where more than 50 percent of the graduating class to earn undergraduate engineering degrees were women.

== History ==
Thayer School of Engineering is named for Colonel and Brevet Brigadier Sylvanus Thayer, a Dartmouth College alumnus from the Class of 1807, who had developed an extensive engineering curriculum West Point&#x27;s United States Military Academy unlike any other in the United States at the time and was known as the &quot;Father of West Point&quot; for his 16-year superintendency and leadership at the academy. In 1867, after 30 years of professional service in the Army Corps of Engineers, Thayer endowed Dartmouth with $40,000 (and increased the gift to $70,000 by 1871) for the establishment of a civilian school of engineering. 
Initially called the Thayer School of Civil Engineering, the school opened in 1871 with three students and with a young lieutenant named Robert Fletcher as its first dean and lone faculty. The curriculum borrowed heavily from the model that Thayer had developed at West Point—a two-year program that culminates in a degree in civil engineering (CE). Under Fletcher, the school&#x27;s enrollment, endowment, faculty and student population, and facilities grew markedly throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s.

Under the administration of Frank Warren Garran (dean of the School from 1933 to 1945), Thayer experienced extensive expansion and modernization. Thayer&#x27;s curriculum expanded to incorporate mechanical engineering and electrical engineering, as well as a dual business/engineering administration degree from the Tuck School of Business. Garran also oversaw the establishment of Cummings Hall, the Thayer School&#x27;s first dedicated physical plant, and the institution of the school&#x27;s first major research program, which was in radiophysics. Dean William P. Kimball (1945–61) continued the school&#x27;s growing emphasis on research and established the first master&#x27;s degrees for students wishing to earn more than a Bachelor of Engineering.

In 1961, Myron Tribus became dean of the School, placing a heavy emphasis on the practical, problem-solving aspects of engineering as well as the traditional, theoretical base of the discipline. Tribus developed an integrated curriculum and introduced design courses to the school to provide Thayer students with real-life experience in creative applications of engineering. Under Tribus, the Thayer School offered its first doctorates in engineering.

From the 1970s to the first decade of the 21st century, the Thayer School saw expansion into new fields such as nanotechnology and biochemical engineering, as well as collaboration with such nearby institutions as Dartmouth Medical School, the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, and the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory. In the early first decade of the 21st century, the core curriculum for undergraduates was revamped under Dean Lewis Duncan (1998–2004), making the school&#x27;s offerings more accessible to non-major Dartmouth students. The MacLean Engineering Sciences Center (ESC), completed in 2006, was a $21 million project to expand the school&#x27;s classrooms and research centers.

== Campus ==
The Thayer School is located on the campus of Dartmouth College, which is situated in the rural, Upper Valley New England town of Hanover, New Hampshire. The campus of the Thayer School sits in a complex on the west side Dartmouth&#x27;s campus near the Connecticut River. When classes first began in 1871, Sylvanus Thayer&#x27;s endowment had not provided for a physical plant. Consequently, the school was an itinerant institution for many years, occupying parts of various College buildings and, at one point, a former structure of the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts.

In 1938, Dartmouth president Ernest Martin Hopkins successfully lobbied the Board of Trustees to construct an independent facility for the school. $200,000 were spent to build Horace Cummings Memorial Hall, which with several major additions (built in 1945-46 and 1989) served as Thayer&#x27;s only facility for nearly 70 years. In 2004, construction began on the MacLean Engineering Sciences Center (ESC), which was completed in 2006. At the cost of nearly $21 million, the new center adds both classroom and research space to the Thayer School.

The Thayer School shares the Murdough Center (containing the Feldberg Business &amp; Engineering Library) with the adjacent Tuck School of Business.

The school doubled its current footprint in 2022 with the opening of the $150 million Class of 1982 Engineering and Computer Science Center, a 165,000-square-foot, four-floor facility that expanded Thayer&#x27;s labs, classrooms, and office spaces, and brought computer science, entrepreneurship, and engineering under one roof. The building is certified LEED Platinum.
== Academics ==
The Thayer School serves as both Dartmouth College&#x27;s undergraduate department of engineering, as well as a graduate school offering advanced degrees. Undergraduate majors can receive their Bachelor of Arts degree in engineering at the school, and may choose to continue on to earn a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) degree in an additional year or less. Thayer also offers a dual-degree program for undergraduates at other colleges who wish to earn their bachelor&#x27;s degree at their home institution and their B.E. at Thayer. As a college academic department, the school&#x27;s undergraduate offerings are open to any Dartmouth student, including non-majors.

Thayer offers several graduate degree programs, including a Master of Engineering (M.Eng) in Biomedical Engineering, Master of Science (M.S.), and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in engineering. The school also offers a Master of Engineering Management (M.E.M.) degree in conjunction with the adjacent Tuck School of Business, and a combination Ph.D/Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) from Dartmouth Medical School. The school also has the United States&#x27; first engineering Ph.D. Innovation Program.

=== Research and entrepreneurship ===
The Thayer School emphasizes the cross-disciplinary nature of its research topics. In 2007, sponsored research at the school amounted to $16.2 million. Research at Thayer is divided into three general &quot;focus areas&quot;: engineering in medicine, energy technologies, and complex systems. Projects within each focus area are divided by three &quot;research categories&quot;: biomedical, biochemical, chemical &amp; environmental engineering (BBCEE), electrical &amp; computer engineering, &amp; engineering physics (ECEEP), and materials &amp; mechanical systems engineering (MMSE).

The Thayer School promotes its connections to engineering entrepreneurship. The Cook Engineering Design Center, founded in 1978, acts to solicit industry-sponsored projects for degree candidates to work on. The school also offers a variety of conferences, programs, and internships to foster student connections to the professional world. Companies and products that have emerged from the Thayer School include emeritus professor Robert Dean&#x27;s Creare, Inc. and Dartmouth music professor Jon Appleton&#x27;s work on the Synclavier synthesizer. The school maintains a list of startup companies established by its current faculty.

=== Rankings and admissions ===
In 2007, the Thayer School was ranked 47th by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; among American engineering schools. It was also included in &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;&#x27;s unranked list of 60 &quot;Best Design Schools in the World&quot;.

Admissions for undergraduate students are handled by Dartmouth College&#x27;s Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Admission to graduate programs, including the B.E. degree, requires an undergraduate background in engineering and mathematics or science. In the fall of 2006, Thayer accepted 14.5% of applicants overall. Average Graduate Record Examination (GRE) test scores of applicants in verbal, quantitative, and analytical sections were 601, 778, and 695, respectively.

== People ==
=== Students ===

As of the 2022–2023 academic year, Dartmouth Engineering enrolls about 445 students, with about 160 undergraduate engineering majors, including 55 Bachelor of Engineering students; 110 Master of Engineering Management students; 20 Master of Engineering students; 10 Master of Science students; 145 PhD candidates in engineering sciences. 

=== Faculty ===

Dartmouth Engineering&#x27;s faculty is composed of about 105 active researchers and instructors, including about 70 tenured or tenure-track faculty; about 20 research or instructional faculty; and about 35 adjunct or visiting faculty. Notable former faculty include Arthur Kantrowitz, emeritus professor of engineering, and Myron Tribus, the dean of the Thayer School for most of the 1960s. In 2020, the school introduced a new position, Associate Dean of Diversity and Inclusion, to help Thayer&#x27;s current and future efforts in diversity and inclusion. Petra Bonfert-Taylor was named to this position in August 2020.

=== Alumni ===

As of 2007, Thayer has 4,046 engineering alumni in all 50 U.S. states and over 50 countries. Nearly 3,000 of the graduates received a B.E. or a graduate degree, with the remaining 1,000 earning only the undergraduate A.B. degree. The school claims that over 90% of graduates become employed within six months of graduation.

<doc id="511307" wikidata="Q1300585" url="?curid=511307" title="Quadrat">
<text>A quadrat is a frame used in ecology, geography, and biology to isolate a standard unit of area for study of the distribution of an item over a large area. Quadrats typically occupy an area of 0.25 m2 and are traditionally square, but modern quadrats can be rectangular, circular, or irregular. A quadrat is suitable for sampling or observing plants, slow-moving animals, and some aquatic organisms.

A photo-quadrat is a photographic record of the area framed by a quadrat. It may use a physical frame to indicate the area, or may rely on fixed camera distance and lens field of view to automatically cover the specified area of substrate. Parallel laser pointers mounted on the camera can also be used as scale indicators. The photo is taken perpendicular to the surface, or as close as possible to perpendicular for uneven surfaces.

==History==

The systematic use of quadrats was developed by the pioneering plant ecologists Roscoe Pound and Frederic Clements between 1898 and 1900. The method was then swiftly applied for many purposes in ecology, such as the study of plant succession. Botanists and ecologists such as Arthur Tansley soon took up and modified the method.

The ecologist John Ernst Weaver applied the use of quadrats to the teaching of ecology in 1918.

==Method==

A quadrat can be used by researchers to methodically count organisms within a smaller, representative area in order to extrapolate to a larger habitat when comprehensive sampling is impossible or not practical. The quadrat&#x27;s size corresponds to the size of the organism being sampled and the overall sampling area. To avoid selection bias, researchers randomly distribute quadrats throughout the sampling area.

For long-term studies, the same quadrats can be revisited after their initial sampling. Methods of precisely relocating the area of study vary widely in accuracy and include measurement from nearby permanent markers, use of total station theodolites, consumer-grade GPS, and differential GPS.

<doc id="511308" wikidata="Q589072" url="?curid=511308" title="Quadrate bone">
<text>The quadrate bone is a skull bone in most tetrapods, including amphibians, sauropsids (reptiles, birds), and early synapsids.

In most tetrapods, the quadrate bone connects to the quadratojugal and squamosal bones in the skull, and forms upper part of the jaw joint. The lower jaw articulates at the articular bone, located at the rear end of the lower jaw. The quadrate bone forms the lower jaw articulation in all classes except mammals.

Evolutionarily, it is derived from the hindmost part of the primitive cartilaginous upper jaw.

== Function in reptiles ==
In certain extinct reptiles, the variation and stability of the morphology of the quadrate bone has helped paleontologists in the species-level taxonomy and identification of mosasaur squamates and spinosaurine dinosaurs.

In some lizards and dinosaurs, the quadrate is articulated at both ends and movable. In snakes, the quadrate bone has become elongated and very mobile, and contributes greatly to their ability to swallow very large prey items.

== Function in mammals ==
In mammals, the articular and quadrate bones have migrated to the middle ear and are known as the malleus and incus. Along with the stapes, which is homologous to some reptilian and amphibian columellae, these are known as the ossicles and are a defining characteristic of mammals.

=== Development ===
In pig embryos, the mandible ossifies on the side of Meckel&#x27;s cartilage, while the posterior part of that cartilage is ossified into the incus. In later development, this portion detaches from the rest of the cartilage and migrates into the middle ear.

<doc id="511312" wikidata="Q339595" url="?curid=511312" title="Prince Nashimoto Morimasa">
<text>was a member of the Japanese Imperial Family and a &quot;field marshal&quot; in the Imperial Japanese Army. An uncle-in-law of Hirohito (Emperor Shōwa), an uncle of his consort, Empress Kōjun, and the father-in-law of Crown Prince Euimin of Korea, Prince Nashimoto was the only member of the Imperial Family arrested for war crimes during the Allied occupation of Japan following defeat in the Second World War.

==Early life==
Prince Nashimoto Morimasa was born in Kyoto, the fourth son of Prince Kuni Asahiko and Harada Mitsue, a court lady. His father, a prince of the blood and one-time Buddhist priest, was the head of one of the &quot;ōke&quot; collateral branches of the Imperial Family created during the early Meiji period. Originally named Prince Tada, his half-brothers included Prince Kaya Kuninori, Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni (served as prime minister in 1945), Prince Yasuhiko Asaka, Prince Kuni Taka, and Prince Kuni Kuniyoshi.

On 2 December 1885, Emperor Meiji named him successor to the Nashimoto-no-miya, another cadet branch of the imperial family. He adopted the personal name &quot;Morimasa&quot; the following year.

==Family==
On 28 November 1897, Prince Nashimoto married Nabeshima Itsuko (2 February 1879 – 18 August 1977), the second daughter of Marquis Nabeshima Naohiro, a former Japanese ambassador to Italy and the son of the last feudal lord &quot;(daimyō)&quot; of Saga Domain. Itsuko was the maternal aunt of Setsuko, Princess Chichibu, Emperor Taishō&#x27;s daughter-in-law.

The couple had two daughters and one adopted son.
# , (4 November 1899 – 30 April 1989). Married the half-brother and heir of Korea&#x27;s last monarch, Yi Un (Crown Prince Euimin) in 1920.
# , (27 April 1907 – 25 August 1985) married Count Hirohashi Tadamitsu in 1926.
# , (22 November 1922 – 7 February 2007), son of Prince Kuni Taka, became Count Tatsuta Norihiko in 1943, adopted by Princess Nashimoto Itsuko to carry on Nashimoto family name on 28 April 1966. Married Princess Kuni Masako, daughter of Prince Kuni Asaakira, in 1945 but divorced her in 1980.

==Military career==
Like the other princes of the imperial blood at the time, Prince Nashimoto Morimasa pursued a military career. Educated at the Central Military Preparatory School and the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, he received a commission as a second lieutenant in the IJA 39th Infantry Regiment in 1899. In 1903, he went to the École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr at St. Cyr, France, but returned to Japan the following year and served with his regiment as a captain under General Oku Yasukata in the Russo-Japanese War. Prince Nashimoto then returned to France in August 1906 and remained until July 1909. The Prince rose to the rank of major of the Infantry in 1906, lieutenant colonel in 1908, and colonel in 1910. He was promoted to lieutenant general and commander of the IJA 16th Division in August 1917.

Prince Nashimoto became a member of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office in November 1919 and was promoted to the rank of general in August 1922. On 8 August 1932, he was given the largely honorary rank of field marshal and became a member of the Board of Marshals and Fleet Admirals. However, the prince held no major military commands during the Pacific War (1941–1945). Unlike his younger half-brothers and Emperor Meiji&#x27;s sons-in-law, Prince Yasuhiko Asaka and Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni (served as prime minister in 1945), he remained largely removed from the mounting radicalism within the army, which culminated in the February 26 Incident of 1936. In October 1937, he became chief priest (&quot;saishu&quot;) of the Ise Shrine, upon the death of his half-brother, Prince Kuni Taka.

Prince Nashimoto retired from the active list aged 70 in 1944. He served as president of the Imperial Association, the honorary president of the Franco-Japanese Society, the Japan Forestry Association, the Japan Agricultural Association, the Imperial Air-Association, the Japan Martial Arts Association, and the Italian Society of Japan.

==Post war==
On 2 December 1945, General Douglas MacArthur, the military governor of Japan during the American occupation, ordered the arrest of Prince Nashimoto as a &quot;class A&quot; war criminal, largely for his role in supporting State Shintoism (Prince Nashimoto was the chief priest of the Grand Shrine of Ise from 1937 until 1947). Prince Nashimoto was also the second most senior member of the Imperial Family (after Prince Kan&#x27;in Kotohito) during World War II.

The prince&#x27;s arrest caused great consternation among the Japanese, as it opened the possibility that Emperor Shōwa and more senior members of the imperial household might also face prosecution for war crimes. Few people on either side regarded Prince Nashimoto as more than a symbol, but he was regarded more as a hostage to ensure Emperor Shōwa&#x27;s compliance with American-directed political reforms. After four months&#x27; imprisonment in Tokyo&#x27;s Sugamo Prison, American authorities released him without charges on 13 April 1946. By action of the reconstituted Imperial Household Council, Prince and Princess Nashimoto were divested of their imperial status and became commoners on 14 October 1947.

However, unlike other former members of the Japanese imperial family, the American Occupation authorities (SCAP) purged former Prince Nashimoto allegedly because of his military career, denying him any compensation for the loss of his title and properties. American bombing raids had already destroyed his Tokyo residence, and he was forced to sell his country villa to pay taxes. He spent his last years in poverty, unlike many other former nobles with more extensive war records.

The former prince died of a heart attack on 2 January 1951 at the age of 76. His widow, former Princess Nashimoto Itsuko, maintained close ties to the Imperial Household until her death in August 1976. She published her memoirs under the title &quot;Nashimoto-no-miya Itsuko-ohi Nikki&quot; (&quot;The Memoirs of Princess Nashimoto Itsuko&quot;) in 1972.

<text>PayPoint plc is a British business offering a system for multichannel payments and retail services in United Kingdom. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.

==History==

The PayPoint network was set up in 1996 with the aim of enabling customers to load gas and electricity onto their pre-paid energy meters in cash at their local convenience store. Prepayment meters are intended to help customers to manage energy use, thereby helping the environment, and control their spending, thereby enabling to live within their limited means. Typically about 40% of customers use prepayment meters for their electricity and gas: this percentage has remained roughly constant over the last five years. First tested in Northern Ireland, the system was expanded to London in 1997 and in 1998, British Gas prepayment meter customers were able to charge their Quantum smart cards at PayPoint retailers.

Following continued growth and public listing, in 2006, the company became the exclusive cash payment network for the BBC&#x27;s TV Licence fee. In November 2006 and February 2007, PayPoint acquired online payment service providers Metacharge and SECPay respectively. In September 2010, PayPoint completed the acquisition of Verrus, a pay-by-phone parking payment provider and re-branded in North America and Europe under the brand name, PayByPhone. In May 2014, PayPoint.net and PayByPhone were merged under a single identity, PayPoint Mobile and Online.

In March 2024, PayPoint partnered with Lloyds Bank. It was announced that Lloyds Bank would be the main card acquiring partner for PayPoint.

==Operations==

PayPoint provides multi-channel payment for clients – Open Banking, direct debit, cards and cash. In most cases, PayPoint&#x27;s fees are usually paid by the payee organisation rather than by the payer, the notable exception being deposits into Monzo bank accounts, for which Monzo deducts a £1 fee from the deposited amount.

==Collect+==
In February 2011, Collect+ a parcel sending and collection service, was launched as a joint venture between PayPoint and Yodel. This service is available through almost 6,000 of the PayPoint retail network in the United Kingdom and allows customers to collect and send packages at their local convenience store.

On 6 April 2020, PayPoint announced an agreement with Yodel to take full ownership of Collect+.

In February 2024, PayPoint partnered with Royal Mail and its Collect+ service.

<text>Alien vs. Predator (also known as Aliens versus Predator and AVP) is a science fiction action-horror media franchise created by comic book writers Randy Stradley and Chris Warner. The series is a crossover between, and part of, the larger &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Predator&quot; franchises, depicting the two species — Xenomorph (Alien) and Yautja (Predator) — as being in conflict with one another.

It began as a comic book series in 1989, before being adapted into a video game series in the 1990s. Produced and distributed by 20th Century Fox, the film series began with &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; (2004), directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, and was followed by &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot; (2007), directed by the Brothers Strause, and the development of a third film has been delayed indefinitely. The series has led to numerous novels, comics, and video game spin-offs such as &quot;Aliens vs. Predator&quot; released in 2010.

==Premise==
The &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; franchise depicts a series of deadly encounters between humanity and other extraterrestrial species: the Aliens, ferocious, endoparasitoid creatures; and the Predators, technologically advanced warriors that hunt for personal sport and honor. Predominantly transpiring in the present day of the 21st century (With both films taking place in 2004, and the second film taking place immediately after the first), the series acts as a spin-off and prequel to the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise portraying humankind&#x27;s encounters with alien species and how they helped shape human civilization, technology and weaponry such as the Colonial Marines, the United America, the Nostromo, and those involved with the Weyland-Yutani Corporation that is seen in the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise of the future.

Throughout the series, audiences see the involvement of the forerunners of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation in the history of these alien creatures as Weyland Industries, headed by Charles Bishop Weyland (one of the many within the Weyland family), who seeks immortality and the advancement of the company, whereas the Yutani Corporation, headed by Ms. Yutani, seeks to study creatures from space and acquire their technology and weaponry for organized warfare. Amidst the actions of the two corporations, human characters are forced to survive infestations of Xenomorphs and clashes with Yautjas, eventually leading to the future merger between the two companies and the development of interstellar travel and eventually wars with other races from space and other advanced technologies. This also leads to the future events of the Alien franchise.

==Background==
The first &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; story was published by Dark Horse Comics in &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; #34–36 (November 1989 – February 1990), leading to the popular &quot;The Machiko Noguchi Saga&quot;, following a woman who joins the hunt of the Predators (Yautja). In November 1990, &quot;Predator 2&quot; was released in theaters and included a scene depicting an Alien (Xenomorph) skull as one of the Predator&#x27;s trophies. Over the coming years, Fox had been pursuing a cinematic adaptation of the concept to advance the &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Predator&quot; franchises further, and Peter Briggs was tasked with the job to write an early script for the project and eventually pitched an idea titled &quot;The Hunt: Alien vs. Predator&quot; in 1994, but the pitch was rejected and development of the film remained stuck in development hell for almost a decade before the first feature film was finally released in 2004 under the helm of Paul W. S. Anderson, titled &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;, with a sequel by the Brothers Strause, titled &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot;, eventually released in 2007. Ellen Ripley does not appear in this franchise, as it takes place more than a century prior to the events of the &quot;Alien&quot; series.
The first actor to be cast for &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; was Lance Henriksen, who played the characters Bishop and Michael Bishop Weyland in &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Alien 3&quot; (and &quot;&quot;). Although the &quot;Alien&quot; films are set 150 years in the future, Anderson wanted to keep continuity with the series by including a familiar actor. Henriksen plays billionaire and self-taught-engineer Charles Bishop Weyland, a character that ties in with the Weyland-Yutani Corporation as the original founder and CEO of Weyland Industries. Henriksen later returned to the franchise through the role of Karl Bishop Weyland, a descendant of Charles Weyland, in the 2010 video game &quot;Aliens vs. Predator&quot;.

According to Anderson, Weyland becomes known for the discovery of the pyramid, and as a result the Weyland-Yutani Corporation models the Bishop android in the &quot;Alien&quot; films after him; &quot;when the Bishop android is created in 150 years time, it&#x27;s created with the face of the creator. It&#x27;s kind of like Microsoft building an android in 100 years time that has the face of Bill Gates.&quot; The Brothers Strause further stated how the ending of their sequel built further upon establishing the future of the universe by having the Predator technology acquired by Yutani Corporation (and by extension Project Stargazer of the &quot;Predator&quot; films) act as the impetus for the development of advanced technologies such as FTL (faster-than-light travel) drives fitted aboard spaceships.

The legacy of the shared universe has also shown itself in later films. In the 2010 film &quot;Predators&quot;, when the group of main protagonists enters the Predators&#x27; camp, there is a brief view of an Alien skull on the ground (as well as the lower jaw of an Alien on the helmet of the Berserker Predator), referring to a similar moment from &quot;Predator 2&quot; when an Alien skull is seen in the trophy room of the Predator spaceship. Furthermore, the 2018 film titled &quot;The Predator&quot; featured several references to &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; such as the shurikens, mask designs, and Alexa&#x27;s spear which the Predator named Scar made out of an Alien tail. An alternate ending for &quot;The Predator&quot; displaying a Weyland-Yutani Corp pod containing Ripley and Newt from &quot;Aliens&quot; (both played by Breanna Watkins) wearing a Weyland-Yutani breathing apparatus shaped like an Alien Facehugger was also intended to further connect to the &quot;Alien&quot; films.

==Films==
===&quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; (2004)===

In 2004, a Predator mothership arrives in Earth&#x27;s orbit to draw humans to an ancient Predator training ground on Bouvetøya, an island about one thousand miles north of Antarctica. A buried pyramid giving off a &quot;heat bloom&quot; attracts a group of explorers led by billionaire and self-taught engineer Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen), the original founder and CEO of Weyland Industries, who unknowingly activates an Alien egg production line as a hibernating Alien Queen is awakened within the pyramid. Three Predators descend unto the planet and enter the structure, killing all humans in their way with the intention of hunting the newly formed Aliens, while the scattered explorers are captured alive by Aliens and implanted with embryos. Two Predators die in the ensuing battle with an Alien, while the third allies itself with the lone surviving human, Alexa &quot;Lex&quot; Woods (Sanaa Lathan), while making their way out of the pyramid as it is destroyed by the Predator&#x27;s wrist bomb and eventually does battle with the escaped Alien Queen on the surface. The Queen is defeated by being dragged down by a water tower into the dark depths of the frozen sea, but not before she fatally wounds the last Predator. The orbiting Predator mothership uncloaks and the crew retrieves the fallen Predator. A Predator elder gives Lex a spear as a sign of respect, and then departs. Once in orbit it is revealed that an Alien Chestburster was present within the corpse, thus a Predalien hybrid is born.

===&quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot; (2007)===

Set immediately after the events of the previous film, the Predalien hybrid aboard the Predator scout ship, having just separated from the mothership shown in the previous film, has grown to full adult size and sets about killing the Predators aboard the ship, causing it to crash in the small town of Gunnison, Colorado. The last surviving Predator activates a distress beacon containing a video recording of the Predalien, which is received by a veteran Predator on the Predator homeworld, who sets off towards Earth to &quot;clean up&quot; the infestation. When it arrives, the Predator tracks the Aliens into a section of the sewer below the town. He removes evidence of their presence as he moves along using a corrosive blue liquid and uses a laser net to try to contain the creatures, but the Aliens still manage to escape into the town above. The Predator fashions a plasma pistol from its remaining plasma caster and hunts Aliens all across town, accidentally cutting the power to the town in the process. During a confrontation with human survivors, the Predator loses its plasma pistol. The Predator then fights the Predalien singlehandedly, and the two mortally wound one another just as the US air force drops a tactical nuclear bomb on the town, incinerating both combatants along with the Predalien&#x27;s warriors and hive, as well as the few remaining humans in the town. The salvaged plasma pistol is then taken to a Ms. Yutani of the Yutani Corporation, foreshadowing an advancement in technology leading to the future events of the &quot;Alien&quot; films.

===Future===
Colin and Greg Strause were adamant that they wanted to develop &quot;Alien vs. Predator 3&quot; during the production of &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot;. They essentially sought to make an &quot;AVP&quot;-film in space and set in the future, but by the time they were hired, 20th Century Fox had already decided to go with Salerno&#x27;s script set on Earth. They incorporated elements of their ideas into the second film, such as the Predator home planet. In 2008 &quot;an anonymous source over at 20th Century Fox got in touch with us over the weekend to relay the news another &quot;Aliens vs. Predator&quot; sequel is a &#x27;certainty&#x27; at this point. If you recall, the brothers Strause – who helmed the Christmas release &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot; – stated Fox was going to take a &#x27;wait-and-see&#x27; approach to a third chapter, furthermore, that the story would have to continue in space.&quot;

On October 28, 2010, io9 published an exclusive interview with the Brothers Strause in which they revealed that &quot;Alien vs. Predator 3&quot; would have led directly into &quot;Alien&quot;. Greg Strause stated that, &quot;The original ending for &quot;AVPR&quot;, that we pitched them, ended up on the Alien homeward [sic], and actually going from the Predator gun, that you see at the end, it was going to transition from that gun to a logo of a Weyland-Yutani spaceship that was heading to an alien planet. And then we were actually going to cut down to the surface [of the alien planet] and you were going to see a hunt going on. It was going to be a whole tribe of predators going against this creature that we called &quot;King Alien.&quot; It&#x27;s this huge giant winged alien thing. And that was going to be the lead-in, to show that the fact that the Predator gun [at the end of &quot;AVPR&quot;] is the impetus of all the technological advancements that allowed humans to travel in space. Which leads up to the &quot;Alien&quot; timeline.&quot;

When asked about the ending sequence of &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot;, that the Predator-weapon handed to Ms. Yutani would lead to humans developing advanced space travel technology, Greg stated, &quot;That was the idea. They never got any of the equipment from the first Predators. It&#x27;s the first time they ever received any intact working technology left over. So they could take that and reverse engineer, figure out what the power source was – all of those things. And in theory, that would enable that company [Weyland-Yutani] to make massive advancements in technology and dominate the space industry. That was the whole idea, was to literally continue from Ms. Yutani getting the gun – and then cut to 50 years in the future, and there&#x27;s spaceships now. We&#x27;ve made a quantum leap in space travel. That was going to set up the ending, which would then set up what &quot;AVP&quot; was going to be, which would take place 100 years in the future. That was kind of the plan.&quot;

Liam O&#x27;Donnell, who worked as a visual effects consultant on &quot;Requiem&quot;, wrote a script treatment for &quot;AVP3&quot; during the production of &quot;Requiem&quot; which was set in South Africa about fifty years in the future when global warming had melted the ice caps (and releasing the Alien Queen from Antarctica), featuring the merger and global rule of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation and their development of interstellar travel based on the recovered Predator technology from Gunnison.

In 2015, having worked on the special effects of &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot;, VFX make-up artist David Woodruff (the son of Tom Woodruff who worked on both the &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Terminator&quot; franchises) participated in an interview with TheTerminatorFans, and when asked about the situation of a third chapter in the &quot;AVP&quot;-trilogy, he stated, &quot;I haven&#x27;t heard anything about a 3rd installment, not even rumors. This Neill Blomkamp project is the first possibility I&#x27;ve seen or heard of another &quot;Alien&quot; film and I&#x27;m all about it. I know the guys at Amalgamated Dynamics are pushing for something like this too. It&#x27;s time.&quot;

In 2015, during the London Film and Comic Con, Sigourney Weaver stated that she asked to have Ripley killed in &quot;Alien 3&quot; because she knew that Fox were moving forward with &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;. Peter Briggs (writer of &quot;The Hunt: Alien vs. Predator&quot;) responded by praising all films in the franchise and pointing out that the &quot;AVP&quot;-films were more successful than Weaver&#x27;s last two &quot;Alien&quot;-films, and noting that &quot;There&#x27;s a terrific &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; movie still to be made by someone. It just hasn&#x27;t happened yet.&quot;

In mid-2018, Shane Black, the director of &quot;The Predator&quot;, tweeted his belief that a third &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; can still happen, indicating the studio&#x27;s interest in both franchises. A ComicBookRumours.com article from July suggested Fox may attempt an &quot;&quot;AVP&quot; Cinematic Universe&quot; after Ridley Scott finishes making , after which Fox considered a &quot;soft reboot&quot; to the &quot;Alien&quot; series with new/original characters, a new setting, and new timeline, which the same article also suggested, if it were to happen, could potentially take place within the same continuity as the &quot;Predator&quot; films and &quot;AVP&quot; films. Noting &quot;Predators&quot; featured an Alien skull cameo (along with other references to &quot;Aliens&quot;) and Lex Woods&#x27; Xenomorph tail spear from &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; make appearance in &quot;The Predator&quot;. Alternate endings produced for &quot;The Predator&quot; displaying a Weyland-Yutani Corp pod containing Ripley and Newt (both played by Breanna Watkins) wearing a Weyland-Yutani breathing apparatus shaped like an Alien Facehugger was also intended to further connect to the &quot;Alien&quot; films. In 2020, Alex Litvak, the co-writer of &quot;Predators&quot; revealed the original script for the film&#x27;s cancelled sequel, which would feature the Colonial Marines from &quot;Aliens&quot;. In 2024, while promoting &quot;&quot;, the film&#x27;s director Fede Álvarez expressed interest in co-directing an &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; film with Dan Trachtenberg, the director of &quot;Prey&quot;.

==Unreleased animated series==
===&quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Annihilation&quot;===
In May 2023, &quot;Alien&quot; Day founder Josh Izzo revealed that &quot;10 episodes of a fully completed &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; anime series&quot; had been completed at 20th Century Fox, intended for a Netflix release prior to its acquisition by Disney, had been produced by Eric Calderon and Dave Baker, and directed by Shinji Aramaki, but was yet to see official release from the Disney Vault, despite completion. Originally developed as an adaptation of Dark Horse Comics&#x27; &quot;The Machiko Noguchi Saga&quot;, with Izzio using the comic as the basis for storyboards in his pitch, the series was redeveloped by Aramaki as a &quot;deep future&quot;-set story set years after the events of &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, told from the perspective of a Yautja clan (including a cyborg and a bone-weapon-wielding warrior named &quot;Bone&quot;) as they hunt down xenomorphs. The unreleased anime series was revealed to be titled &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Annihilation&quot;.

===Video games===

The 1993 SFC beat &#x27;em up &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; was developed by Jorudan and Published by Activision (NA, PAL) and IGS (JP).

Game Boy version &quot;Alien vs. Predator: The Last of His Clan&quot; was Developed by ASK Kodansha.

An &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; arcade beat &#x27;em up game was released by Capcom in 1994, following a now-android Dutch Schaefer and Linn Kurosawa of the United States Colonial Marine Corps as they join forces with two Yautja to fend off an invasion of xenomorphs. Two other &quot;Alien vs Predator&quot; games were also published by Activision for the SNES and Game Boy in 1993. There were also several &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; mobile games, and two cancelled titles for the Atari Lynx and Game Boy Advance.

In 1994, Atari Corporation released the Rebellion Developments-developed first-person shooter &quot;Alien vs Predator&quot; for the Atari Jaguar, in which one could play as an Alien, Marine, or Predator. Rebellion then went on to develop the similarly themed 1999&#x27;s &quot;Aliens versus Predator&quot; for the PC. This was followed by, among others, &quot;Aliens versus Predator 2&quot; and the expansion pack &quot;Aliens versus Predator 2: Primal Hunt&quot;. In 2003, a real-time strategy game &quot;Aliens Versus Predator: Extinction&quot; was made for the PS2 and Xbox featuring 3 campaign modes for both races as well as humans. It featured several variations of Predators and Aliens seen throughout the films and other forms of media including the famous Predalien. In 2010, Sega released a reboot, &quot;Aliens vs. Predator&quot;, a multiplatform first-person shooter also made by Rebellion and tied into the timeline of the live-action films.

Both Alien and Predator appear as downloadable characters in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (2015).

The film series&#x27; characters of Predators in the franchise appeared in the video game &quot;&quot; (2020).

===Action figures===
During the 1980s and 1990s, Halcyon Models released seventeen &quot;Alien&quot; model kits, beginning in 1987, as well as a &quot;Predator 2&quot; model kit in 1994.

In 1994, Kenner released a collection of action figures known as &quot;Aliens vs. Predator&quot;. This followed the two initial series of &quot;Aliens&quot; that were based on an animated series, &quot;Operation: Aliens&quot;, that was never broadcast. As such, the inclusion of Predator is often considered the 3rd and 4th series of the &quot;Aliens&quot; line. This collection includes several Aliens, many of which feature built-in attack features, and Predators, which include removable masks and battle weapons such as spears and missile launchers. The figures generally possess 5 points of articulation, and some include a mini Dark Horse comic book.

While the collection as a whole is known as &quot;Aliens vs. Predator&quot;, the two character types have their own card art that only features the character at hand. An exception would be the &quot;Aliens vs. Predator&quot; 2-pack. Since human space marines were included in the initial &quot;Aliens&quot; line, the Predator was marketed as an alternative enemy to the Aliens. A figure cardback reads: &quot;The stage is set for the universe&#x27;s two most ferocious enemies. It&#x27;s the gruesome and evil Aliens against the big-game hunter Predator. Who will win... the beast or the hunter? Can the Predator stop the evil Aliens before the galaxy is destroyed?!?!?!&quot;

In 1998, Kay Bee Toys released the Kenner produced &quot;Aliens: Hive Wars&quot; line featuring Aliens, Marines, and Predators. More figures, including a female Predator and an Alien/Predator/Smash Mason 3-pack, were designed for this series but never released as part of the line.

Six sets of Aliens and Predator Micro Machines were also planned by Galoob in 1995 but never released. This would have also included the LV-426/Outer World Station Action Fleet Playset. Thanks in part to the research of toy collectors, many photos of these unreleased toys and prototypes have shown up online in recent years.

In December 2002, McFarlane Toys released a highly detailed &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; deluxe set. In 2004, they produced a series of figures based on the &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; film. Alongside the articulated figures, McFarlane also released statuesque display sets depicting scenes from the film.

Hot Toys produced highly detailed 16&quot; tall figures for every film including &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot; in 2007.

NECA has produced various lines of &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; figures for several years. In 2007, they released two series of &quot;Requiem&quot; figures.

In 2013, a line of ReAction Figures &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Predator&quot; toys were produced.

Originally having produced figures based on the 2013 video game &quot;Aliens: Colonial Marines&quot;, Hiya Toys has also released figures based on &quot;Predator&quot;, &quot;Predator 2&quot;, and &quot;Alien: Covenant&quot;.

Funko Pop! Vinyl currently produces ongoing lines of &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; figures.

Minimates produces ongoing lines of &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; figures.

Loot Crate and Titans Vinyl Figures have collaborated in producing several figures and other merchandise based on characters and creatures from the &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; universe.

Eaglemoss Collections currently produces the ongoing &quot;Alien &amp; Predator&quot; line of figures based on characters and creatures from the &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; universe.

===Theme park attractions===

<text>This is a list of numbered highways in the province of Nova Scotia.

== Arterial (100-series) highways ==
A 100-series highway is a designation applied to a highway that can be a controlled-access expressway, Super-2, or fully divided freeway. The designation can also be applied in some cases to sections of uncontrolled access roads which are deemed strategically important and which will be upgraded in the future to controlled-access.

==Trunk Highways==
Nova Scotia&#x27;s original arterial highway number system had route number signs in the same shape as the U.S. Highway route number signs. These signs are now used for Trunk routes. Former, &quot;missing&quot;, Trunk routes were largely downgraded to Collector Routes in 1969.

<text>Tintin in Tibet () is the twentieth volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. It was serialised weekly from September 1958 to November 1959 in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine and published as a book in 1960. Hergé considered it his favourite &quot;Tintin&quot; adventure and an emotional effort, as he created it while suffering from traumatic nightmares and a personal conflict while deciding to leave his wife of three decades for a younger woman. The story tells of the young reporter Tintin in search of his friend Chang Chong-Chen, who the authorities claim has died in a plane crash in the Himalayas. Convinced that Chang has survived and accompanied only by Snowy, Captain Haddock and the Sherpa guide Tharkey, Tintin crosses the Himalayas to the plateau of Tibet, along the way encountering the mysterious Yeti.

Following &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot; (1958) and its large number of characters, &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; differs from other stories in the series in that it features only a few familiar characters and is also Hergé&#x27;s only adventure not to pit Tintin against an antagonist. Themes in Hergé&#x27;s story include extrasensory perception, the mysticism of Tibetan Buddhism, and friendship. Translated into 32 languages, &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; was widely acclaimed by critics and is generally considered to be Hergé&#x27;s finest work; it has also been praised by the Dalai Lama, who awarded it the Light of Truth Award. The story was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion; the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; was adapted for the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the 1992–93 BBC Radio 5 dramatisation of the &quot;Adventures&quot;, the 1996 video game of the same name, and the 2005–06 Young Vic musical &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;; it was also prominently featured in the 2003 documentary &quot;Tintin and I&quot; and has been the subject of a museum exhibition.

==Synopsis==
While on holiday at a resort in the French Alps with Snowy and Captain Haddock, Tintin reads about a plane crash in the Gosain Than Massif in the Himalayas of Tibet. He then has a vision of his friend Chang Chong-Chen, badly injured and calling for help from the wreckage of the crashed plane. Convinced of Chang&#x27;s survival, Tintin flies to Kathmandu, via Delhi, with Snowy and a skeptical Captain Haddock. They hire a Sherpa named Tharkey and, accompanied by porters, travel overland from Nepal towards the crash site.

The porters abandon the group in fear when mysterious tracks are found, while Tintin, Haddock and Tharkey go on and eventually reach the crash site. Tintin sets off with Snowy to trace Chang&#x27;s steps, and finds a cave where Chang has carved his name on a rock. On leaving the cave, he encounters a snowstorm and glimpses what seems to be a human silhouette. Tharkey believes that Tintin saw the Yeti and convinces him to abandon his friend and return with him to Nepal, since the area is too large to search. Tintin spots a scarf on a cliff face, concludes Chang is nearby, and continues with only the Captain. While attempting to scale a cliff face, Haddock slips and hangs out of reach, imperilling Tintin, who is tied to him. He tells Tintin to cut the rope to save himself, but Tintin refuses. Haddock tries to cut it himself, but drops his knife, alerting Tharkey, who has returned in time to rescue them. They try to camp for the night but lose their tent and must trek onwards, unable to sleep lest they freeze, arriving within sight of the Buddhist monastery of Khor-Biyong before being caught in an avalanche.

Blessed Lightning, a monk at the monastery, has a vision of Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, and Tharkey in danger. Tintin regains consciousness and, too weak to walk, gives Snowy a note to deliver. Snowy runs to the monastery, loses the message, but is recognised as the dog from Blessed Lightning&#x27;s vision. Tintin, Haddock and Tharkey regain consciousness in the monastery and are brought before the Grand Abbot. The Abbot tells Tintin to abandon his quest, but Blessed Lightning has another vision, through which Tintin learns that Chang is still alive inside a mountain cave at the Horn of the Yak—and that the Yeti is also there. Tintin and Haddock travel on to the Horn of the Yak.

They arrive at a cave. Tintin ventures inside and finds Chang, who is feverish and shaking. The Yeti suddenly appears, revealed as a large anthropoid, reacting with anger at Tintin&#x27;s attempt to take Chang. As it lunges at Tintin, the flash bulb of Tintin&#x27;s camera goes off, and scares the Yeti away. Chang tells Tintin that the Yeti saved his life after the crash. Upon returning to inhabited lands, the friends are surprised to be met by the Grand Abbot, who presents Tintin with a khata scarf in honour of the bravery he has shown for his friend Chang. As the party travels home, Chang muses that the Yeti is not a wild animal, but has a human soul. The Yeti sadly watches their departure from a distance.

==History==
===Background and early ideas===
In October 1957, Hergé sent his publisher, Casterman, the cover of his completed nineteenth &quot;Tintin&quot; adventure, &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;, and for several weeks considered plot ideas for his next story. Fondly recalling the Scouting days of his youth, his first idea was to send Tintin back to the United States, as in the third adventure, &quot;Tintin in America&quot;, to help a group of Native Americans defend their land from a large corporation that wished to drill for oil; on reflection, Hergé came to believe that retracing old ground would be a step backwards. Another idea had Tintin striving to prove that Haddock&#x27;s butler Nestor was framed for a crime committed by his old employers, the Bird brothers. He dismissed this as well, but kept the idea of an adventure with no guns or violence—the only &quot;Tintin&quot; story without an antagonist. A third idea sent Tintin and Professor Calculus to a snow-covered polar region, where a stranded group of explorers need Calculus to save them from food poisoning. He abandoned this plot also, but kept the setting in a snowy environment and decided to focus, not on Calculus, but on his main character Tintin.

A collaborator of Hergé&#x27;s, Jacques Van Melkebeke, had suggested in 1954 to set a story in Tibet, likely influenced by the play he adapted for Hergé in the 1940s, (&quot;Mr. Boullock&#x27;s Disappearance&quot;). Bernard Heuvelmans, a cryptozoologist who had helped Hergé envision lunar exploration for the two-part &quot;Destination Moon&quot; and &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;, had given him a copy of his book (&quot;On the Trail of Unknown Animals&quot;) in 1955, inscribing on the inside the suggestion that one day Tintin should meet the Yeti. By 1958, Hergé decided that Tibet would be the setting of Tintin&#x27;s next &quot;Adventure&quot;. Initial ideas for the title were (&quot;The Cow&#x27;s Snout&quot;), (&quot;The Bear&#x27;s Snout&quot;), and (&quot;The Yak&#x27;s Snout&quot;), all of which refer to the mountain in the latter part of the story. Although it was initially claimed that &quot;market research&quot; chose the title &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; suggesting sales would be better if the book used Tintin&#x27;s name in the title, entertainment producer and author Harry Thompson suggested &quot;the title reflected the solo nature of [Tintin&#x27;s] undertaking&quot;.

===Hergé&#x27;s psychological problems===
Hergé reached a particularly traumatic period in his life and suffered a mental breakdown. In 1956, he realised that he had fallen out of love with his wife Germaine, whom he had married in 1932, and by 1958, he and Fanny Vlaminck, a colourist at Studios Hergé twenty-eight years his junior, had developed a deep mutual attraction. They began courting; Hergé&#x27;s new companion lifted his morale and shared many of his interests. Germaine soon began interfering with the courtship, causing Hergé to admit his desire had been to maintain a relationship with both women. When he failed to please either, he began to contemplate divorcing Germaine to marry Fanny. His Catholic upbringing and Boy Scout ethic, however, caused him to feel tremendous guilt. As he later related to interviewer Numa Sadoul: &quot;It meant turning upside down all my values—what a shock! This was a serious moral crisis: I was married, and I loved someone else; life seemed impossible with my wife, but on the other hand I had this scout-like idea of giving my word for ever. It was a real catastrophe. I was completely torn up&quot;. During this period, Hergé had recurrent nightmares where he faced images of what he described as &quot;the beauty and cruelty of white&quot;—visions of white and snow that he could not explain. As he later told Sadoul: &quot;At the time, I was going through a time of real crisis and my dreams were nearly always white dreams. And they were extremely distressing. I took note of them and remember one where I was in a kind of tower made up of a series of ramps. Dead leaves were falling and covering everything. At a particular moment, in an immaculately white alcove, a white skeleton appeared that tried to catch me. And then instantly everything around me became white&quot;.

At the advice of his former editor Raymond de Becker, Hergé travelled to Zürich to consult the Swiss psychoanalyst Franz Riklin, a student of Carl Jung, to decipher his disturbing dreams. Riklin latched on to the &quot;quest for purity&quot; that featured so prominently in Hergé&#x27;s dreams, and ultimately in &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;. He told the author that he must destroy &quot;the demon of purity&quot; in his mind as soon as possible: &quot;I do not want to discourage you, but you will never reach the goal of your work. It comes to one or the other: you must overcome your crisis, or continue your work. But, in your place, I would stop immediately!&quot;

Although Hergé was tempted to abandon &quot;Tintin&quot; at Riklin&#x27;s suggestion, devoting himself instead to his hobby of abstract art, he felt that doing so would be an acceptance of failure. In the end, he left his wife so that he could marry Fanny Vlaminck, and continued work on &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;, trusting that completing the book would exorcise the demons he felt possessed him. &quot;It was a brave decision, and a good one&quot;, said British Tintin expert Michael Farr. &quot;Few problems, psychological included, are solved by abandoning them&quot;. Thompson noted: &quot;It was ironic, but not perhaps unpredictable, that faced with the moral dilemma posed by Riklin, Hergé chose to keep his Scout&#x27;s word of honour to Tintin, but not to Germaine&quot;. Belgian Tintin expert Philippe Goddin summarised: &quot;[Hergé] sought to regain a lost equilibrium, that he imposes on his hero a desire to seek purity ... considering it necessary for Tintin to go through the intimate experience of distress and loneliness ... and discover himself&quot;.

===Influences===
In creating &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;, Hergé drew upon a range of influences. Setting it in the Himalayas, a snow-covered environment, followed his recurring dreams of whiteness and his need to create an adventure that &quot;must be a solo voyage of redemption&quot; from the &quot;whiteness of guilt&quot;. The idea of a solo voyage led to Tintin being accompanied only by Snowy, their guide, and a reluctant Haddock—who supplies the needed counterpoint and humour.

While considering the character of Chang, absent since &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, Hergé thought of his artistic Chinese friend Zhang Chongren, whom he had not seen since the days of their friendship over twenty years earlier. Hergé and Zhang used to spend every Sunday together, during which Hergé learned much about Chinese culture for his work on &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;. Later, Zhang moved back to his homeland and Hergé lost contact with his friend after the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. Hergé felt Chang and Tintin must be reunited, just as he hoped to see his friend again some day.

Hergé read a variety of books about Tibet for this project: Fosco Maraini&#x27;s &quot;Secret Tibet&quot;, Heinrich Harrer&#x27;s &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;, Tsewang Pemba&#x27;s &quot;Tibet my Homeland&quot;, Maurice Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Annapurna&quot;, discredited author Lobsang Rampa&#x27;s &quot;The Third Eye&quot;, and the books of Belgian explorer and spiritualist Alexandra David-Néel. Hergé visited the Belgian Alpine Society to examine their photographic collection of the Himalayas, and they sent him photographer Richard Lannoy&#x27;s work on India. Models for drawings such as of monks with musical instruments, Sherpas with backpacks, and the aircraft wreckage came from clippings Hergé had collected from sources such as &quot;National Geographic&quot;. Members of the Studios helped him gather other source material; for instance, collaborator Jacques Martin researched and drew the story&#x27;s costumes.

To learn about the Yeti, which he depicted as a benevolent creature, Hergé contacted his friend Bernard Heuvelmans, the author of &quot;On the Trail of Unknown Animals&quot;. After re-reading Heuvelmans&#x27; description of the Yeti, Hergé went on to research the cryptid species as much as possible. Hergé interviewed mountaineers, including Herzog, who had spotted the tracks of what he believed was an enormous biped that stopped at the foot of a rock face on Annapurna. The creature&#x27;s care for the starving Chang derives from a Sherpa account of a Yeti that rescued a little girl in similar circumstances. Another influence came from Fanny Vlaminck, who was interested in extrasensory perception and the mysticism of Tibetan Buddhism, prominent themes in the story that also fascinated Hergé.

===Publication===
Studios Hergé serialised &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; weekly from September 1958 to November 1959, two pages per week, in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine. Because of his desire for accuracy, Hergé added the logo of Air India to the airliner crash debris. A representative of Air India complained to Hergé about the adverse publicity the airline might suffer, arguing: &quot;It&#x27;s scandalous, none of our aircraft has ever crashed; you have done us a considerable wrong&quot;. Air India had cooperated with Hergé, aiding his research by providing him reading material, contemporary photographs, and film footage of India and Nepal, particularly Delhi and Kathmandu. While the crashed aircraft&#x27;s tail number remained &quot;VT&quot;, the country code for Indian aircraft, Hergé agreed to change the airline logo in the published edition to the fictional Sari-Airways, dryly noting that there were so many Indian airlines it was possible that there really was a Sari-Airways.

While developing the story, members of the Studios confronted Hergé with concerns about elements of &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;. Bob de Moor feared the scene in which Haddock crashes into a stupa was disrespectful to Buddhists. Jacques van Melkebeke suggested that the Yeti not be depicted to create a sense of enigma; Hergé disagreed, believing that it would disappoint his child readers.

After the serial concluded, Hergé worked with his publisher, Casterman, to produce the work in book form. Hergé&#x27;s original design for the front cover featured Tintin and his expedition standing on a backdrop of pure white. Casterman deemed it too abstract, so Hergé added a mountain range at the top; biographer Benoît Peeters expressed that in doing so, the image was deprived of some of its &quot;strength and originality&quot;.

During production, Hergé kept abreast of the turbulent political developments in Tibet. In March 1959, Tibet&#x27;s foremost political and spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, fled the region into self-imposed exile in India during the 1959 Tibetan uprising. In May 2001, when &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; was published in China, state authorities renamed it &quot;Tintin in Chinese Tibet&quot;. When Casterman and the Hergé Foundation protested, the authorities restored the book&#x27;s original title.

==Reception==
Hergé came to see &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; as his favourite volume in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. He thought it an ode to friendship, composed &quot;under the double sign of tenacity and friendship&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s a story of friendship&quot;, Hergé said about his book years later, &quot;the way people say, &#x27;It&#x27;s a love story.

===Critical analysis===
&quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; is well received by critics from the comics and literary fields. Farr calls it &quot;exceptional in many respects, standing out among the twenty-three completed &quot;Tintin&quot; adventures ... an assertion of the incorruptible value of bonds of friendship&quot;. Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier laud it as &quot;the ultimate &quot;Tintin&quot; book&quot;, reaching &quot;a degree of perfection, both in its story and in its stunning art, that has rarely been equaled, before or since&quot; and &quot;arguably the best book in the series&quot;. They detail the story&#x27;s many emotional moments: Haddock&#x27;s willingness to sacrifice his life for Tintin&#x27;s, Tharkey&#x27;s return, the tearful reunion of Tintin and his starving friend Chang, the reverence paid to Tintin by the Grand Abbot and the monks, and the Yeti&#x27;s sadness while watching the departure of his only friend. &quot;For a comic book to handle such powerful emotions, convey them to the readers, and make them feel what the characters are feeling is a rare and precious achievement&quot;. Thompson calls it &quot;a book of overwhelming whiteness and purity&quot;, saying that the &quot;intensely personal nature of the story made this Hergé&#x27;s favourite &quot;Tintin&quot; adventure&quot;, adding that if readers wonder whether &quot;the enormous weight [was] lifted from Hergé&#x27;s shoulders, [this] can be seen in his next book, &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;, a masterpiece of relaxation&quot;. As &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; was translated into 32 languages, Donald Lopez, professor of Buddhist and Tibetan studies, calls it the &quot;largest selling book about Tibet&quot;.

Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès, in a psychoanalytical analysis of &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;, observes that Tintin is more firmly in control of the plot than he was in earlier adventures. Apostolidès notes that the character displays worry and emotion not present previously, something he suggested showed Tintin sorting out the problems that he faced in life. In his analysis, he calls Tintin a &quot;foundling&quot; and his friend Chang &quot;the lost child&quot; and &quot;Tintin&#x27;s twin ... the heroes have to struggle to great heights to escape the temporality and pervasive values of [the] universe&quot;. He saw the Yeti, who &quot;internalises certain human characteristics&quot;, as more complex than Hergé&#x27;s previous bestial character, Ranko in &quot;The Black Island&quot;: &quot;The monster loves Chang with a love as unconditional as Tintin&#x27;s love for his friend&quot;.

The literary analysis of Tom McCarthy compares Tintin&#x27;s quest to Hergé&#x27;s conquest of his own fear and guilt, writing, &quot;this is the moira of Hergé&#x27;s own white mythology, his anaemic destiny: to become Sarrasine to Tintin&#x27;s la Zambinella&quot;. McCarthy suggested the &quot;icy, white expanses of Hergé&#x27;s nightmares [may] really have their analogue in his own hero&quot;, especially as &quot;Tintin represents an unattainable goal of goodness, cleanness, authenticity&quot;.

Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline opines that the work is &quot;a portrait of the artist at a turning point&quot; in his life. He believes that it &quot;stands alone&quot; in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; due to its lack of antagonist and few characters, describing it as &quot;a spiritual quest&quot; where the &quot;only conflict is between man and nature ... [Hergé] put the best of himself into &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;&quot;. Referring to its &quot;stripped-bare story and archetypal clarity&quot;, Benoît Peeters believes &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; to be one of the two &quot;pivotal&quot; books in the series, alongside &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, and deems it poignant that Chang features in both. He also suggests that Hergé included the benevolent Yeti to &quot;make up for the interminable massacre&quot; of animals in the second Tintin adventure, &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, and that the sadness the Yeti experienced at the story&#x27;s end reflected Hergé&#x27;s feelings about his separation from Germaine. Peeters concluded: &quot;Even more than Art Spiegelman&#x27;s &quot;Maus&quot;, &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; is perhaps the most moving book in the history of the comic strip&quot;.

===Awards===
At a ceremony in Brussels on 1 June 2006, the Dalai Lama bestowed the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT)&#x27;s Light of Truth Award upon the Hergé Foundation in recognition of &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;, which introduced the region to audiences across the globe. ICT executive director Tsering Jampa said: &quot;For many, Hergé&#x27;s depiction of Tibet was their introduction to the awe-inspiring landscape and culture of Tibet&quot;. During the ceremony, copies of &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; in the Esperanto language () were distributed. Accepting the award for the foundation, Hergé&#x27;s widow Fanny Rodwell said: &quot;We never thought that this story of friendship would have a resonance more than 40 years later&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Eight years after Hergé&#x27;s death, &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; was adapted into an episode of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (1991–92), a television series by French studio Ellipse and Canadian animation company Nelvana. The episode was directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, with Thierry Wermuth voicing Tintin. &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; was also a 1992 episode of the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, in which Richard Pearce voiced Tintin. The book became a video game for the PC and Super NES in 1995.

&quot;Tintin and I&quot; (2003), a documentary by Danish director Anders Høgsbro Østergaard based on Numa Sadoul&#x27;s 1971 interview with Hergé, includes restored portions of the interview that Hergé had heavily edited and rewritten in Sadoul&#x27;s book. With full access to the audio recordings, the filmmaker explored the personal issues that the author had while he was creating &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; and how they drove him to create what is now regarded as his most personal adventure.

As the centenary of Hergé&#x27;s birth approached in 2007, &quot;Tintin&quot; remained popular. &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; was adapted into a theatrical musical, &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;, which ran from late 2005 to early 2006 at the Barbican Arts Centre in London. The production, directed by Rufus Norris and adapted by Norris and David Greig, featured Russell Tovey as Tintin. The musical was revived at the Playhouse Theatre in London&#x27;s West End before touring in 2007. In 2010, the television channel Arte filmed an episode of its documentary series (&quot;On the Trail of Tintin&quot;) in the Nepalese Himalayas, exploring the inspiration and setting of &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;. From May to September 2012, the Musée Hergé in Louvain-la-Neuve hosted an exhibition about the book, entitled &quot;Into Tibet with Tintin&quot;.

<text>The Grampian Mountains () is one of the three major mountain ranges in Scotland, that together occupy about half of Scotland. The other two ranges are the Northwest Highlands and the Southern Uplands. The Grampian range extends northeast to southwest between the Highland Boundary Fault and the Great Glen. The range includes many of the highest mountains in the British Isles, including Ben Nevis (whose peak contains the highest point in the British Isles at above sea level) and Ben Macdui (whose peak contains second-highest at ).

A number of rivers and streams rise in the Grampians, including the Tay, Spey, Cowie Water, Burn of Muchalls, Burn of Pheppie, Burn of Elsick, Cairnie Burn, Don, Dee and Esk. The area is generally sparsely populated.

There is some ambiguity about the extent of the range, and until the nineteenth century, they were generally considered to be more than one range, which all formed part of the wider Scottish Highlands. This view is still held by many today, and they have no single name in the Scottish Gaelic language or the Doric dialect of Lowland Scots. In both languages, a number of names are used. The name &quot;Grampian&quot; has been used in the titles of organisations covering parts of Scotland north of the Central Belt, including the former local government area of Grampian Region (translated into Scots Gaelic as &quot;Roinn a&#x27; Mhonaidh&quot;), NHS Grampian, and Grampian Television.

== Name ==
The Roman historian Tacitus recorded &quot;Mons Graupius&quot; as the site of the defeat of the native Caledonians by Gnaeus Julius Agricola c. 83 AD. The actual location of &quot;Mons Graupius&quot;, literally &#x27;Mount Graupius&#x27; (the element &#x27;Graupius&#x27; is of unknown meaning), is a matter of dispute among historians, though most favour a location within the Grampian massif, possibly at Raedykes, Megray Hill or Kempstone Hill. The spelling &quot;Graupius&quot; comes from the &quot;Codex Aesinas&quot;, a mediaeval copy of Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot; believed to be from the mid-9th century. In the Middle Ages, this locale was known as the Mounth, a name still held by a number of geographical features.

=== Etymology ===
Recorded first as &quot;Graupius&quot; in 83 A.D, the origin of the name &quot;Grampians&quot; is uncertain. The name may be Brittonic and represent a corrupted form, of which the genuine would be &quot;*Cripius&quot;, containing &quot;*crip&quot; meaning &quot;ridge&quot; (c.f. Welsh &quot;crib&quot;).

&quot;Graupius&quot; was incorrectly rendered &quot;Grampius&quot; in the 1476 printed edition of Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Agricola&quot;. The name &quot;Grampians&quot; is believed to have first been applied to the mountain range in 1520 by the Scottish historian Hector Boece, perhaps an adaptation of the incorrect &quot;Mons Grampius&quot;. Thus the range may owe its name to a typesetter&#x27;s mistake.

== Extent ==
There is some ambiguity about the extent of the range. Fenton Wyness, writing about Deeside, puts the northern edge of the Grampians at the River Dee in the introduction to his 1968 book &quot;Royal Valley : The Story Of The Aberdeenshire Dee&quot;:

This introduction appears to suggest that Wyness defines the Grampians as being the range of mountains running from immediately south of Aberdeen westward to Beinn Dearg in the Forest of Atholl. Similarly, Adam Watson, when defining the extent of the Cairngorms, specifically excluded the range south of the River Dee, writing:

Both Wyness and Watson appear to exclude the Cairngorms from the Grampians, regarding them as a separate range. In effect, Wyness&#x27; and Watson&#x27;s definition of the Grampians is as a synonym for the Mounth. However Robert Gordon, writing in the 1650s, used the term Grampians to refer to hills on either side of the River Dee, and thus explicitly included the Cairngorms within the range.

Wyness and Watson both exclude areas west of the Pass of Drumochter from the Grampians, but the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica adopted a wider definition, including the highlands as far as Dunbartonshire in the west.

==Geology==
The Grampian Mountains are chiefly made up of metamorphic and igneous rocks. The mountains are composed of granite, gneiss, marble, schists and quartzite.

The Quaternary glaciation (&lt;2.6 Ma) eroded the region significantly, and glacial deposits, such as tills, are largely those of the last Ice Age (&lt; 20 Ka).

==Sub-ranges==
The following ranges of hills and mountains fall within the generally recognised definition of the Grampians, i.e. lying between the Highland and Great Glen fault lines:

* Cairngorms
* Monadh Liath
* Mounth
* Grey Corries
* Mamores
* Ben Alder Forest
* The mountains of Glen Coe and Glen Etive
* Black Mount
* Breadalbane Hills
* Trossachs
* Arrochar Alps
* Cowal
* The Isle of Arran

==In Literature==
In the popular 1756 play &quot;Douglas&quot;, the second act begins with a speech that mentions the Grampian Hills:

 My name is Norval; on the Grampian Hills
 My father feeds his flocks; a frugal swain, 
 Whose constant cares were to increase his store.
 And keep his only son, myself, at home. 

The speech &quot;acquired a life of its own, independent of the play, and became widely known through public recitations, lessons in speech, school memorizations and the like&quot; during the 18th and 19th centuries. The speech (and thus the reference to the Grampian Hills) are casually referred to by Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and George Bernard Shaw.

Since 2017, Rudolph has voiced various characters for the animated sitcom &quot;Big Mouth&quot;, including Connie the Hormone Monstress, which won her four Primetime Emmy Awards. For her portrayal of politician Kamala Harris on &quot;SNL&quot;, she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. Rudolph received three Primetime Emmy Award nominations for playing a judge in the comedy series &quot;The Good Place&quot; (2018–2020). In 2024, &quot;Time&quot; named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world. She is the daughter of late singer Minnie Riperton (1947–1979) and composer Richard Rudolph.

==Early life==
Rudolph was born in Gainesville, Florida on July 27, 1972. Her mother, Minnie Riperton, was a singer, and her father, Richard Rudolph, was a composer. Her mother was African-American and her father is Jewish. Her paternal grandfather was Sidney Rudolph, a philanthropist who once owned all of the Wendy&#x27;s and Rudy&#x27;s restaurants in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Her great-grandfather was born in Vilnius, Lithuania, changed his surname from &quot;Rudashevsky&quot; to &quot;Rudolph&quot;, and was one of the founding members of Congregation Beth Shalom, a Conservative Jewish synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Rudolph&#x27;s godmother was R&amp;B singer Teena Marie (1956–2010). On an episode of PBS&#x27;s &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, Rudolph discovered that her maternal great-great-great-grandfather was James Grigsby, who was born into slavery in Lincoln County, Kentucky. Grigsby was denied financial compensation and freedom granted by the last will and testament of his owner, John Warren Grigsby, and challenged the owner&#x27;s grandson in court in the 1830s.

Rudolph&#x27;s parents moved to Los Angeles, California, when their children were very young, and Rudolph grew up primarily in the Westwood neighborhood. Near the end of the song &quot;Lovin&#x27; You&quot;, Riperton repeats &quot;Maya&quot;, as can be heard in her performance on &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;. Riperton died of breast cancer on July 12, 1979, at the age of 31, two weeks before Maya&#x27;s seventh birthday. In 1990, Rudolph graduated from Crossroads School in Santa Monica, California, where she befriended schoolmates Gwyneth Paltrow and Jack Black. She attended the University of California, Santa Cruz, living in Porter College. In 1995, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in photography.

<text>Thunderpants is a 2002 family comedy film about a boy whose incredible capacity for flatulence gets him a job as an astronaut. The film was directed by Pete Hewitt, whose previous work included &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Borrowers&quot; (1997). The script was written by Phil Hughes, based on a story by Pete Hewitt about a boy who dreams of being a spaceman, despite his chronic flatulence.

==Plot==
Born with two stomachs, Patrick Smash (Bruce Cook) is uncontrollably and devastatingly flatulent. No more than thirty seconds after his birth, he first breaks wind, horrifying his parents (Bronagh Gallagher, and Victor McGuire) and doctor (Robert Hardy). As he grows up, Patrick&#x27;s farts become so uncontrollable and destructive that his father has to flee their home, as he is often injured by his son&#x27;s gaseous emissions, whose force is so strong that it can blow people over. Patrick is bullied at school as a result of his condition, but eventually finds strength in his disorder, ultimately gaining revenge on the school bully Damon (Joshua Herdman) by passing gas in his face, leaving him scarred for life. 

Patrick&#x27;s only friend is child prodigy Alan A. Allen (Rupert Grint), who has anosmia, and, therefore, lacks the ability to smell. Alan and Patrick team up to make Thunderpants, reinforced short trousers strong enough to contain Patrick&#x27;s emissions. 

One day, on the way to visit Alan, Patrick sees Alan being taken away in a mysterious black car; Alan&#x27;s father informs Patrick that Alan will not be returning home soon. Patrick gets recruited by an opera singer (Simon Callow) to help him with his world tour; Patrick uses this as an opportunity to search for Alan. Eventually, Patrick learns that Alan went to the US to help retrieve a group of astronauts who are trapped in outer space, and Patrick finds that his condition may be of use to the spacemen in peril.

==Reception==
The film has received a rating of 67% at the film review website Rotten Tomatoes, based upon 6 reviews.

&quot;Empire&quot; magazine wrote in their review that &quot;Thunderpants&quot; is &quot;a well-made, quirky oddity for adults, but a laugh riot for kids and Beano nostalgists... underneath all the expelled air it&#x27;s really just a simple tale of a boy finding his talent and making the most of it&quot;. The hosts of the &quot;RedLetterMedia&quot; web series &quot;Best of the Worst&quot; shared similar sentiments when reviewing the film with the consensus being that the movie was too charming and well-made to be considered a &quot;bad&quot; film.

During an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, Paul Giamatti referred to this film as one of the high points in his career. In 2023, whilst promoting The Holdovers, Giamatti referred to Thunderpants as &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;one of the most remarkable movies [he&#x27;s] been in&quot;.

He served as Master of the Buckhounds from 1900 to 1901 in the Conservative administration of Lord Salisbury and was admitted to the Privy Council in 1901. He was killed in a hunting accident in 1907, after being thrown from his horse, leaving the title to his 13-year-old son.

His grandson, the fifth Baron, served as Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport from 1959 to 1964 in the Conservative governments of Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home and was admitted to the Privy Council in 1964. He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Baron. He served in the Conservative administration of John Major as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard (Deputy Chief Government Whip in the House of Lords) from 1995 to 1997. However, he lost his seat in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. the title is held by his son, the seventh Baron, who succeeded in 2009. As a male-line descendant of the first Earl of Burlington, Baron Chesham is also in remainder to that title, which has been held by the Dukes of Devonshire since 1858.

The family seat is The Old Post House, in Ropley, Hampshire.

<text>Baron Churston, of Churston Ferrers and Lupton in the County of Devon, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1858 for the former Conservative Member of Parliament, Sir John Yarde, 3rd Baronet. He had earlier represented South Devon in the House of Commons. Two years later, in 1860, he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Buller. the titles are held by his great-great-great-great-grandson, the sixth Baron, who succeeded his father in that year.

The baronetcy, of Lupton House in the County of Devon, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 13 January 1790 for the lawyer Sir Francis Buller. He was the son of James Buller.

<doc id="511373" wikidata="Q221175" url="?curid=511373" title="Latin school">
<text>The Latin school was the grammar school of 14th- to 19th-century Europe, though the latter term was much more common in England. Other terms used include Lateinschule in Germany, or later Gymnasium. Latin schools were also established in Colonial America.

Emphasis was placed on learning Latin, initially in its Medieval Latin form. Grammar was the most basic part of the trivium and the Liberal arts. Latin schools aimed to prepare students for university, as well as seeking to enable those of middle-class status to rise above their station. It was therefore not unusual for children of commoners to attend Latin schools, especially if they were expected to pursue a career within the church. Although Latin schools existed in many parts of Europe in the 14th-century and were more open to the laity, prior to that the Church allowed for Latin schools for the sole purpose of training those who would one day become clergymen. Latin schools began to develop to reflect Renaissance humanism around the 1450s. In some countries, but not England, they later lost their popularity as universities and some Catholic orders began to prefer the vernacular.

== History ==
=== Medieval background ===
Medieval Europe thought of grammar as a foundation from which all forms of scholarship should originate. Grammar schools otherwise known as Latin schools taught Latin by using Latin. Latin was the language used in nearly all academic and most legal and administrative matters, as well as the language of the liturgy. Some of the laity, though not instructed formally, spoke and wrote some Latin. Courts, especially church courts, used Latin in their proceedings, although this was even less accessible than the vernacular to the lower classes, who often could not read at all, let alone Latin.

Students often studied in Latin school for about five years, but by their third year, students would be deemed as &quot;knowledgeable enough&quot; in Latin grammar to assist the master teacher in teaching the younger or less skilled pupils. Most boys began at the age of seven but older men who wanted to study were not discouraged as long as they could pay the fees. Students usually finished their schooling during their late teens, but those who desired to join the priesthood had to wait until they were twenty-four in order to get accepted. There was usually a limit to how long a student could stay in school, although if a relative was one of the school&#x27;s founders then an extended stay was possible.

Schools were managed by appointing a committee who then employed a teacher and paid their salary. These schools usually had limited supervision from the town authorities. Freelance Latin masters opened up their own schools quite frequently and would provide Latin education to anyone willing to pay. These freelance schools usually taught students in the master&#x27;s home. Others taught as a tutor in a student&#x27;s household by either living there or making daily visits to teach. Students ranged from those who were members of the peasantry to those of the elite. If a serf&#x27;s child wanted to go to school, payment given to the lord was required (to replace the value of his labour) as well as his consent.

=== Renaissance and Early Modern perceptions ===

As Europeans experienced the intellectual, political, economic and social innovations of the Renaissance so did their attitudes towards Medieval Latin schools. Renaissance humanists criticized Medieval Latin calling it &quot;barbaric jargon&quot;. Scholars like the Dutch humanist, Desiderius Erasmus (1466–1536), denounced the church and the way it taught. He desired that a Renaissance in the Roman Catholic Church should accompany the study of the classics. Humanist ideas became so influential that residents in Italian states began to call for a new kind of education in Latin. Schools and academies that centred on instructing classical literature, history, rhetoric, dialectic, natural philosophy, arithmetic, medieval texts, the Greek language, as well as modern foreign languages, emerged. They called this new curriculum the &quot;Studia Humanitatis&quot;. Latin school formed the basis of education in the elite Italian city-states. Positions such as headmaster of grammar schools or professor of Latin grammar, rhetoric and dialect, were filled in by erudite humanists. Guarino da Verona, another humanist, devised three stages for humanistic learning: the elementary, the grammatical and the rhetorical. Humanists held the belief that by being a learned individual they were contributing to society. Hence, humanistic education constituted the intermediate and advanced levels for most of the urban population. It created an opportunity to advance an individual&#x27;s social status since more institutions intellectual, political and economic sought workers who possessed a background in classical Latin as well as training in humanistic scripts.

Still considered as the language of the learned, Latin was esteemed and used frequently in the academic field. However, at the start of the 14th century, writers started writing in the vernacular. Due to this event and the common practice of interweaving Latin with a dialect even at advanced stages in learning, the precedence of Latin schools from other pedagogical institutions diminished.

== Latin church schools ==
Clergy often funded ecclesiastical schools where clerics taught. Many historians argue that up until 1300 the Church had a monopoly on education in medieval Italy. Latin church schools seemed to appear around the 12th century; however, very few remained after the 14th century, as a vernacular, more definite form of Latin school emerged in Italy. In some areas in Spain during the late 15th century, the church encouraged priests and sacristans to train others in reading and writing.

After the Protestant Reformation, the Catholic Church tried to deal with the surfacing of Protestant Latin schools that involved itself with orienting church authorities and pastors. John Calvin, a reformer, taught Latin grammar along with the Geneva catechism. Nevertheless, there were some reformers who wanted to cease using Latin in worship, finding the vernacular a more efficient language to use. In the latter part of the 16th century, the Catholic Counter-Reformation supported the establishment of municipal schools.
Jesuits founded their own schools and offered free training in Latin grammar, Philosophy, Theology, Geography, Religious Doctrine and History for boys. It was important for Jesuits as well as the Catholic Reformation to instruct clergymen as well as laymen in this type of education. The Jesuits pursued the significance of education to their order and took over the teaching responsibilities in Latin schools and secondary schools along with other Catholic orders in several Catholic areas.

== Latin school curriculum ==
The Latin school curriculum was based mainly on reading Classical and some medieval authors. Students had to learn the principles of &quot;Ars Dictaminis&quot; in order to learn how to write formal letters. Authors often had lists of books that were supposed to be used in the curriculum that would teach students grammar. These texts however, were often not the original texts, as more often than not, texts were changed to include moral stories or to display rules of grammar. These were usually in the form of fables or poems. New students generally started off with easy basic grammar, and steadily moved into harder Latin readings such as the &quot;Donatus&quot; (&quot;Ars Minor&quot; stage), which was a syntax manual that was memorized, or even more advanced with glossaries and dictionaries. Although many teachers used many books that varied from person to person, the most popular textbook would have been the &quot;Doctrinale&quot;. The &quot;Doctrinale&quot; was a long verse of Latin grammar. This textbook dealt with parts of speech, syntax, quantity and meter, as well as figures of speech. The Doctrinale as well as a large sum of other books (though not nearly as popular) was often referred to as the &quot;canon of textbooks&quot;. Similarly, as the student advanced into the &quot;Ars Dictaminis&quot; stage more theory and practice writing formal or prose letters were focused on. Poetry was often a teachers favorite as it taught not only Latin, but mnemonic value and &quot;truth&quot;. Poetry was not chiefly studied during the medieval times, although some classic poems were taken into the curriculum. However, during the Renaissance, pupils greatly studied poetry in order to learn metrics and style. As well, it was viewed as a broader study of Latin grammar and rhetoric, which often included concepts, and analysis of words

=== &quot;Ars Dictaminis&quot; ===
&quot;Ars Dictaminis&quot; was an area of study that was created in the latter part of the Middle Ages as a response to the demand for social communication as 
offices for religious and political leaders increased. Rhetoric was seen as a method of persuasion and so there were five distinct 
aspects of &quot;Ars Dictaminis&quot; that assured this. These five elements were: &quot;how to word a question; how to dispose material; how to find the right words and effective stylistic devices; how to commit everything to memory; how to find the right intonation and suitable gestures&quot;. During the Renaissance however, 
rhetoric developed into the study of how to write official and private letters as well as records. The revised &quot;Ars Dictaminis&quot; took its guidelines from one of Cicero&#x27;s works, the &quot;de inventione&quot; and pseudo-Ciceronian &quot;Rhetorica ad Herennium&quot;. There were five main parts: the &quot;salutatio&quot; (salutation), &quot;benevolentiae&quot; (winning the agreement of the recipient through the arrangement of words), &quot;narratio&quot; (the point of the discussion), &quot;petitio&quot; (petition), and &quot;conclusio&quot; (conclusion). This systematic presentation was attributed to the Medieval preference for hierarchal organization.

=== &quot;Studia Humanitatis&quot; ===

&quot;Studia Humanitatis&quot; was the new curriculum founded in the Early Modern Era by humanists. In order to be able to move forward academically, a firm foundation in &quot;Studia Humanitatis&quot; starting from elementary school was necessary. Those who studied under &quot;Ars Dictaminis&quot; but did not have this background found it difficult to get accepted into chanceries following the year 1450. Those who did study under this discipline were taught classical literature, history, rhetoric, dialectic, natural philosophy, arithmetic, some medieval texts, Greek as well as modern foreign languages. The use of pagan authors became more common as the church became less involved with the humanistic method used in academic institutions before university. &quot;Colloquies&quot; (1518), a book containing dialogues written for the study of Latin grammar, was written by Erasmus and became one of the most popular books of its time. Students of &quot;Studia Humanitatis&quot; were seen as well prepared for occupations pertaining to politics or business. Learning the classics and other subjects in this curriculum enabled the individual to speak, argue and write with eloquence and relevance.

== Other institutions ==
Early Modern children were first taught to read and write the vernacular and were then sent to Latin schools. If the parents were financially able, the child went even before he learned to read or write if the opportunity was present. Men were the usual students since women were either taught at home or in nunneries. Subsequent to the Council of Trent&#x27;s decision to cloister all female religious, female orders such as Ursulines and Angelicals conducted their own schools within their convents. University was the final stage of academic learning and within its walls Latin was the language of lectures and scholarly debates. Jews however, including those who were converted into Christianity, were not allowed to teach so they developed their own schools which taught Doctrine, Hebrew and Latin.
==Latin schools in colonial North America and the US==

Latin schools, on the same model, were founded in North America, importing the European methods of education. The first of these was Boston Latin School, founded in 1635. These fed early universities such as Harvard, with students capable of speaking, reading and debating in Latin. The challenge to the Latin, Greek and &quot;classical&quot; domination of education came earlier than in Europe, but the tradition continued at a diminished level through the 20th century and into the 21st. A number of &quot;Latin Schools&quot; still exist in the US, some of which teach Latin, while others do not.

<text>Baron Cottesloe, of Swanbourne and Hardwick in the County of Buckingham, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 2 March 1874 for the Conservative politician and former Chief Secretary for Ireland, Sir Thomas Fremantle, 1st Baronet (1798–1890). He was the son of Admiral Sir Thomas Fremantle (1765–1819). Lord Cottesloe had already been created a Baronet, of Swanbourne in the County of Buckingham, on 14 August 1821, chiefly in recognition of his father&#x27;s services, and with remainder to the latter&#x27;s heirs. His father Sir Thomas Fremantle was created Baron Fremantle, of the Austrian Empire, which Lord Cottesloe inherited in 1819 with the death of his father. Subsequently, in 1822 he was given a Royal licence, which authorized him and his successors to use the title in Britain. However, a warrant issued on 27 April 1932 withdrew all the royal licences, only allowing the use of the title to the then current holders, their heir (if any was born) and their heir&#x27;s heir (if any was born). The fifth baron was the last holder being allowed to use the Austrian title in the United Kingdom.

==History==

The 1st Baron Cottesloe was succeeded by his eldest son, Thomas Fremantle, 2nd Baron Cottesloe. He represented Buckinghamshire in the House of Commons as a Conservative. His son, the 3rd Baron, served as Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire. The latter&#x27;s grandson, the fifth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1994, also served as Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire between 1984 and 1997. , the title is held by his son, the sixth baron, who succeeded in that year.

Several other members of the Fremantle family have also gained distinction. William Henry Fremantle, uncle of the first Baron, was a politician. John Fremantle, son of Colonel Stephen Fremantle, uncle of the first Baron, was a major-general in the army. He was the father of 1) General Sir Arthur Fremantle and of 2) FitzRoy William Fremantle, a major-general in the Coldstream Guards. Sir Charles Fremantle, brother of the first Baron, was a naval commander. The town of Fremantle, Western Australia, is named after him. The Very Reverend the Hon. William Robert Fremantle, brother of the first Baron, was Dean of Ripon. The Very Reverend the Hon. William Henry Fremantle, second son of the first Baron, was Dean of Ripon and Canon of Canterbury. His second son Sir Francis Edward Fremantle was a Conservative politician. The Hon. Sir Charles Fremantle (1834–1915), third son of the first Baron, was an administrator with the Suez Canal Company. The Hon. Sir Edmund Fremantle, fourth son of the first Baron, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. He was the father of 1) Admiral Sir Sydney Fremantle and 2) Sir Selwyn Fremantle, an administrator in India.

<text>In mathematics, the RSA numbers are a set of large semiprimes (numbers with exactly two prime factors) that were part of the RSA Factoring Challenge. The challenge was to find the prime factors of each number. It was created by RSA Laboratories in March 1991 to encourage research into computational number theory and the practical difficulty of factoring large integers. The challenge was ended in 2007.

RSA Laboratories (which is an initialism of the creators of the technique; Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) published a number of semiprimes with 100 to 617 decimal digits. Cash prizes of varying size, up to US$200,000 (and prizes up to $20,000 awarded), were offered for factorization of some of them. The smallest RSA number was factored in a few days. Most of the numbers have still not been factored and many of them are expected to remain unfactored for many years to come. , the smallest 23 of the 54 listed numbers have been factored.

While the RSA challenge officially ended in 2007, people are still attempting to find the factorizations. According to RSA Laboratories, &quot;Now that the industry has a considerably more advanced understanding of the cryptanalytic strength of common symmetric-key and public-key algorithms, these challenges are no longer active.&quot; Some of the smaller prizes had been awarded at the time. The remaining prizes were retracted.

The first RSA numbers generated, from RSA-100 to RSA-500, were labeled according to their number of decimal digits. Later, beginning with RSA-576, binary digits are counted instead. An exception to this is RSA-617, which was created before the change in the numbering scheme. The numbers are listed in increasing order below.
Note: until work on this article is finished, please check both the table and the list, since they include different values and different information.

==RSA-100==
RSA-100 has 100 decimal digits (330 bits). Its factorization was announced on April 1, 1991, by Arjen K. Lenstra. Reportedly, the factorization took a few days using the multiple-polynomial quadratic sieve algorithm on a MasPar parallel computer.

The value and factorization of RSA-100 are as follows:

 RSA-100 = 1522605027922533360535618378132637429718068114961380688657908494580122963258952897654000350692006139

==RSA-129==
RSA-129, having 129 decimal digits (426 bits), was not part of the 1991 RSA Factoring Challenge, but rather related to Martin Gardner&#x27;s Mathematical Games column in the August 1977 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;.

RSA-129 was factored in April 1994 by a team led by Derek Atkins, Michael Graff, Arjen K. Lenstra and Paul Leyland, using approximately 1600 computers from around 600 volunteers connected over the Internet. A US$100 token prize was awarded by RSA Security for the factorization, which was donated to the Free Software Foundation.

The value and factorization are as follows:

The factorization was found using the Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve algorithm.

The factoring challenge included a message encrypted with RSA-129. When decrypted using the factorization the message was revealed to be &quot;The Magic Words are Squeamish Ossifrage&quot;.

In 2015, RSA-129 was factored in about one day, with the CADO-NFS open source implementation of number field sieve, using a commercial cloud computing service for about $30.

<text>Western Reserve Academy (WRA), or simply Reserve, is a private, midsized, coeducational boarding and day college preparatory school located in Hudson, Ohio, United States. A boarding school, Western Reserve Academy is largely a residential campus, with 280 of 390 students living on campus and the remainder attending as day students. Students from over 20 states and 15 countries attend.

==History==


Western Reserve Academy was established on February 7, 1826, as the &quot;Western Reserve College and Preparatory School&quot; in Hudson, Ohio, on a plot of land set aside by charter by the Ohio legislature. Reserve is the 27th oldest preparatory boarding school in the United States, and the oldest outside of the Northeast.

The institution&#x27;s name comes from the area in which it was built, the Connecticut Western Reserve, as it was the first of its kind in Northern Ohio. The settlers from Connecticut wanted to build a school of the same caliber as Yale College. They selected the same architectural design, with brick buildings and the same motto, &quot;Lux et Veritas&quot;. People called it &quot;the Yale of the West.&quot; The first cohort included eleven students at the college level and eight at the preparatory level. In 1882, the college section moved north to Cleveland and became Western Reserve University, later merging with the Case Institute of Technology to become Case Western Reserve University. Western Reserve Academy remained open for another twenty-one years until 1903, when it closed due to financial problems.

In 1916, however, the school reopened with the support of James Ellsworth, a former student and Hudson resident who had returned after becoming wealthy in the coal industry. The &quot;Ellsworth Era&quot; was marked by significant construction: Seymour Hall (the newly appointed academic building), the Bicknell Gymnasium, and Ellsworth Hall, a dormitory and dining hall. In 1922, Western Reserve Academy became an all-boys institution, staying this way for fifty years, until 1972, when girls were introduced into the junior class, once again becoming a co-ed institution.

In 2001, Western Reserve Academy was recognized by U.S. News &amp; World Report as one of the top boarding schools in the country.

==Extracurricular activities==
===Athletics===
The school offers various sports, including soccer, golf, cross country, field hockey, volleyball, swimming and diving, basketball, wrestling, riflery, baseball, softball, track and field, tennis, and lacrosse.

Western Reserve Academy has become one of the top high school lacrosse teams in the United States. In 2006 and 2009, WRA won the Midwest Scholastic Lacrosse Championship and respectively finished ranked 27th and 28th nationally according to LaxPower.com. Only three different teams have won the Midwest Championships since 1992: Brother Rice High School, Western Reserve Academy, and Upper Arlington High School. &quot;Inside Lacrosse&quot; ranked the 2009 WRA lacrosse team number one in the Midwest.

The track and cross-country teams achieved success from the 1940s through the 1980s, winning many Interstate League championships, with the cross-country team once boasting a streak of 179–1. The WRA track is named after track and cross country coach Frank Longstreth and hosts the annual Frank Longstreth Relays.

In 2012, the girls&#x27; and boys&#x27; soccer teams achieved a state ranking, with the boys experiencing an undefeated season and the girls&#x27; teams, both JV and varsity, breaking the record for most season wins. The boys tied top Ohio Division I team St. Ignatius High School and finishing the year atop the Ohio Division III rankings.

Traditionally, a rivalry with University School has existed, having first played each other in 1895. Other notable rivalries include The Kiski School, Linsly School, and Hawken School.

===Arts===
Reserve offers over 20 different classes catering to students interested in the arts. Courses are available through the school&#x27;s music, dance, theater, and visual arts programs. 2D and 3D art rooms are always available to students, and a Graphic Design computer lab and a workshop for Woodworking. Most fine arts occur in the Knight Fine Arts Center (KFAC), with the music program headquartered in Hayden Hall. KFAC contains several classrooms, a theater, and a dance studio. The Moos Gallery, also in KFAC, features students&#x27; work and exhibits from established artists.

KFAC is also home to the Wang Innovation Center (WIC), allowing students to take classes as part of WRA&#x27;s interdisciplinary curriculum.

===Traditions===
Western Reserve Academy has several traditions. One of the most popular is Vespers, a Christmas Concert and sit-down meal right before students leave for winter break. Another is sit-down meals. The entire faculty and student body have a sit-down lunch each Wednesday. The meal is family-style, and students sit with their academic advisors in an intimate setting. Another frequent tradition is the victory bell. Almost lost after the construction of the Murdough Athletic Center, this tradition was rekindled when the bell was reinstalled in 2012. After each Reserve athletic victory, the players on the winning team take turns ringing the bell loud enough for the entire campus to hear. Reserve students also participate in artistic and musical traditions, including the annual &quot;Messiah Sing&quot; concert. The Academy String Orchestra and Academy Choir perform Handel&#x27;s Messiah and invite the audience to join in for many songs.

Finally, the last tradition Reserve students experience, Commencement, is set just outside the historic chapel. The graduating men wear Reserve green and white pants while the women wear white dresses. They are led through campus by bagpipers and followed by the faculty. As each student is called up, they receive their diploma and the alum tie (for men) or pin (for women).

====Dress code====
Western Reserve Academy enforces a relatively strict dress code daily. Boys must wear a coat and tie all week, with special &quot;Reserve Green&quot; (consisting of a green jacket with the Academy crest and a green striped tie) mandatory on Monday and Friday. On some Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, wearing coats are not strictly enforced. Likewise, girls on &quot;Reserve Green&quot; days must wear a green blazer and a green kilt.

==Campus==
===Chapel and Loomis Observatory===
WRA&#x27;s campus houses many old buildings. However, two, in particular, stand out: the Loomis Observatory and the chapel, both listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Initially built in 1836 and most recently updated in 2021, the chapel is still used today for Morning meetings twice weekly. In addition, marriages, concerts, and gatherings take place inside the chapel. The Commencement ceremony at the end of the year takes place outside the chapel. Even though the school itself is nondenominational, the chapel has a cross hanging front and center, which used to hang in the Spanish monastery Santa Maria de La Rabida (La Rábida Friary). It is said that Christopher Columbus prayed before that cross before he voyaged to the New World.

The Loomis Observatory, initially named The Observatory, was built in 1838. It was the third observatory built in the country and is currently the second oldest observatory in the United States, only behind the Hopkins Observatory at Williams College. The Hudson building was named for astronomer Elias Loomis. This three-room observatory still stands, sitting close to the edge of the campus near the music building, Hayden Hall. The building itself is closed from public view, as well as the telescope housed in the observatory, which is no longer used (in favor of a newer and more secluded observatory on Cross Country Hill).

===Ong Library===
Named after Ambassador John D. Ong, the Ong Library is a 21,000 sq ft. building located on the south end of campus. It contains nearly 23,000 books, 3,000 DVDs and CDs, and 110 periodicals. Open to students all day through study hours, the library features two computer labs and a dozen group study rooms. The basement also contains the Western Reserve Academy Archives Collection, which follows the 200-year-old school and town history.

===Dormitories===

There are ten dormitories in which the over 200 boarding students reside during the school year. The oldest is North Hall, erected in 1838, and the newest is Bicknell House. Each dorm houses students in a single, double, triple, or quad, with shared bathrooms.

Each dorm has 2-3 faculty residents, one serving as Dorm Head, all living in connected apartments. Approximately 85% of the faculty members reside on campus in either faculty homes or dormitory apartments.

==Notable alumni==
Individuals with a † next to their name were enrolled in either or both institutions before Western Reserve College moved from the Hudson campus to Cleveland in 1882 and became Western Reserve University. The degree to which they were affiliated with both institutions may vary. Individuals with a * next to their name did not complete their studies.

<text>Eagle Pass (elevation ) is a mountain pass through the Gold Range of the Monashee Mountains in British Columbia, Canada. It divides the Columbia River drainage basin from that of the Fraser River (via the Shuswap Lakes and the Thompson River).

Eagle Pass was chosen as the route of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), and later the Trans-Canada Highway, over the Monashees. The line over the Eagle Pass was the last section of the CPR to be completed; the last spike was driven at a location known as Craigellachie in 1885.

The pass was discovered by Walter Moberly in his role as Assistant Surveyor General of British Columbia in 1865.

The nearest city to Eagle Pass is Revelstoke, 20 kilometres to the east.

<doc id="511394" wikidata="Q427523" url="?curid=511394" title="Opioid">
<text>Opioids are a class of drugs that derive from, or mimic, natural substances found in the opium poppy plant. Opioids work on opioid receptors in the brain and other organs to produce a variety of morphine-like effects, including pain relief.

The terms &#x27;opioid&#x27; and &#x27;opiate&#x27; are sometimes used interchangeably, but the term &#x27;opioid&#x27; is used to designate all substances, both natural and synthetic, that bind to opioid receptors in the brain. Opiates are alkaloid compounds naturally found in the opium poppy plant &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;.

Medically they are primarily used for pain relief, including anesthesia. Other medical uses include suppression of diarrhea, replacement therapy for opioid use disorder, and suppressing cough. The opioid receptor antagonist naloxone is used to reverse opioid overdose. Extremely potent opioids such as carfentanil are approved only for veterinary use. Opioids are also frequently used recreationally for their euphoric effects or to prevent withdrawal. Opioids can cause death and have been used, alone and in combination, in a small number of executions in the United States.

Side effects of opioids may include itchiness, sedation, nausea, respiratory depression, constipation, and euphoria. Long-term use can cause tolerance, meaning that increased doses are required to achieve the same effect, and physical dependence, meaning that abruptly discontinuing the drug leads to unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. The euphoria attracts recreational use, and frequent, escalating recreational use of opioids typically results in addiction. An overdose or concurrent use with other depressant drugs like benzodiazepines can result in death from respiratory depression.
Opioids act by binding to opioid receptors, which are found principally in the central and peripheral nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. These receptors mediate both the psychoactive and the somatic effects of opioids. Partial agonists, like the anti-diarrhea drug loperamide and antagonists, like naloxegol for opioid-induced constipation, do not cross the blood–brain barrier, but can displace other opioids from binding to those receptors in the myenteric plexus.
Because opioids are addictive and may result in fatal overdose, most are controlled substances. In 2013, between 28 and 38 million people used opioids illicitly (0.6% to 0.8% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). By 2021, that number rose to 60 million. In 2011, an estimated 4 million people in the United States used opioids recreationally or were dependent on them. As of 2015, increased rates of recreational use and addiction are attributed to over-prescription of opioid medications and inexpensive illicit heroin. Conversely, fears about overprescribing, exaggerated side effects, and addiction from opioids are similarly blamed for under-treatment of pain.

==Terminology==
Opioids include &quot;opiates&quot;, an older term that refers to such drugs derived from opium, including morphine itself. &quot;Opiate&quot; is properly limited to the natural alkaloids found in the resin of the opium poppy although some include semi-synthetic derivatives. Other opioids are semi-synthetic and synthetic drugs such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, and fentanyl; antagonist drugs such as naloxone; and endogenous peptides such as endorphins. The terms &quot;opiate&quot; and &quot;narcotic&quot; are sometimes encountered as synonyms for opioid. &quot;Narcotic&quot;, derived from words meaning &#x27;numbness&#x27; or &#x27;sleep&#x27;, originally referred to any psychoactive compound with numbing or paralyzing properties. As an American legal term, &quot;narcotic&quot; refers to cocaine and opioids, and their source materials; it is also loosely applied to any illegal or controlled psychoactive drug. In some jurisdictions all controlled drugs are legally classified as &quot;narcotics&quot;. The term can have pejorative connotations and its use is generally discouraged where that is the case.

==Medical uses==

=== Pain ===
The weak opioid codeine, in low doses and combined with one or more other drugs, is commonly available in prescription medicines and without a prescription to treat mild pain. Other opioids are usually reserved for the relief of moderate to severe pain.

====Acute pain====
Opioids are effective for the treatment of acute pain (such as pain following surgery). For immediate relief of moderate to severe acute pain, opioids are frequently the treatment of choice due to their rapid onset, efficacy and reduced risk of dependence. However, a new report showed a clear risk of prolonged opioid use when opioid analgesics are initiated for an acute pain management following surgery or trauma. They have also been found to be important in palliative care to help with the severe, chronic, disabling pain that may occur in some terminal conditions such as cancer, and degenerative conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. In many cases opioids are a successful long-term care strategy for those with chronic cancer pain.

Just over half of all states in the US have enacted laws that restrict the prescribing or dispensing of opioids for acute pain.

====Chronic non-cancer pain====
Guidelines have suggested that the risk of opioids is likely greater than their benefits when used for most non-cancer chronic conditions including headaches, back pain, and fibromyalgia. Thus they should be used cautiously in chronic non-cancer pain. If used the benefits and harms should be reassessed at least every three months.

In treating chronic pain, opioids are an option to be tried after other less risky pain relievers have been considered, including paracetamol or NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen. Some types of chronic pain, including the pain caused by fibromyalgia or migraine, are preferentially treated with drugs other than opioids. The efficacy of using opioids to lessen chronic neuropathic pain is uncertain.

Opioids are contraindicated as a first-line treatment for headache because they impair alertness, bring risk of dependence, and increase the risk that episodic headaches will become chronic. Opioids can also cause heightened sensitivity to headache pain. When other treatments fail or are unavailable, opioids may be appropriate for treating headache if the patient can be monitored to prevent the development of chronic headache.

Opioids are being used more frequently in the management of non-malignant chronic pain. This practice has now led to a new and growing problem with addiction and misuse of opioids. Because of various negative effects the use of opioids for long-term management of chronic pain is not indicated unless other less risky pain relievers have been found ineffective. Chronic pain which occurs only periodically, such as that from nerve pain, migraines, and fibromyalgia, frequently is better treated with medications other than opioids. Paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including ibuprofen and naproxen are considered safer alternatives. They are frequently used combined with opioids, such as paracetamol combined with oxycodone (Percocet) and ibuprofen combined with hydrocodone (Vicoprofen), which boosts the pain relief but is also intended to deter recreational use.

=== Other ===

==== Cough ====
Codeine was once viewed as the &quot;gold standard&quot; in cough suppressants, but this position is now questioned. Some recent placebo-controlled trials have found that it may be no better than a placebo for some causes including acute cough in children. As a consequence, it is not recommended for children. Additionally, there is no evidence that hydrocodone is useful in children. Similarly, a 2012 Dutch guideline regarding the treatment of acute cough does not recommend its use. (The opioid analogue dextromethorphan, long claimed to be as effective a cough suppressant as codeine, has similarly demonstrated little benefit in several recent studies.)

Low dose morphine may help chronic cough but its use is limited by side effects.

====Diarrhea====
In cases of diarrhea-predominate irritable bowel syndrome, opioids may be used to suppress diarrhea. Loperamide is a peripherally selective opioid available without a prescription used to suppress diarrhea.

The ability to suppress diarrhea also produces constipation when opioids are used beyond several weeks. Naloxegol, a peripherally-selective opioid antagonist is now available to treat opioid induced constipation.

==== Shortness of breath ====
Opioids may help with shortness of breath particularly in advanced diseases such as cancer and COPD among others. However, findings from two recent systematic reviews of the literature found that opioids were not necessarily more effective in treating shortness of breath in patients who have advanced cancer.

==== Restless legs syndrome ====
Though not typically a first line of treatment, opioids, such as oxycodone and methadone, are sometimes used in the treatment of severe and refractory restless legs syndrome. 

Hyperalgesia
Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) has been evident in patients after chronic opioid exposure.

==Adverse effects==
Each year 69,000 people worldwide die of opioid overdose, and 15 million people have an opioid addiction.

In older adults, opioid use is associated with increased adverse effects such as &quot;sedation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, urinary retention, and falls&quot;. As a result, older adults taking opioids are at greater risk for injury. Opioids do not cause any specific organ toxicity, unlike many other drugs, such as aspirin and paracetamol. They are not associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and kidney toxicity.

Prescription of opioids for acute low back pain and management of osteoarthritis seem to have long-term adverse effects

According to the USCDC, methadone was involved in 31% of opioid related deaths in the US between 1999–2010 and 40% as the sole drug involved, far higher than other opioids. Studies of long term opioids have found that many stop them, and that minor side effects were common. Addiction occurred in about 0.3%. In the United States in 2016 opioid overdose resulted in the death of 1.7 in 10,000 people.

===Reinforcement disorders===
====Tolerance====
Tolerance is a process characterized by neuroadaptations that result in reduced drug effects. While receptor upregulation may often play an important role other mechanisms are also known. Tolerance is more pronounced for some effects than for others; tolerance occurs slowly to the effects on mood, itching, urinary retention, and respiratory depression, but occurs more quickly to the analgesia and other physical side effects. However, tolerance does not develop to constipation or miosis (the constriction of the pupil of the eye to less than or equal to two millimeters). This idea has been challenged, however, with some authors arguing that tolerance &quot;does&quot; develop to miosis.

Tolerance to opioids is attenuated by a number of substances, including:
* calcium channel blockers
* intrathecal magnesium and zinc
* NMDA antagonists, such as dextromethorphan, ketamine, and memantine.
* cholecystokinin antagonists, such as proglumide
* Newer agents such as the phosphodiesterase inhibitor ibudilast have also been researched for this application.

Tolerance is a physiologic process where the body adjusts to a medication that is frequently present, usually requiring higher doses of the same medication over time to achieve the same effect. It is a common occurrence in individuals taking high doses of opioids for extended periods, but does not predict any relationship to misuse or addiction.

====Physical dependence====
Physical dependence is the physiological adaptation of the body to the presence of a substance, in this case opioid medication. It is defined by the development of withdrawal symptoms when the substance is discontinued, when the dose is reduced abruptly or, specifically in the case of opioids, when an antagonist (&quot;e.g.&quot;, naloxone) or an agonist-antagonist (&quot;e.g.&quot;, pentazocine) is administered. Physical dependence is a normal and expected aspect of certain medications and does not necessarily imply that the patient is addicted.

The withdrawal symptoms for opiates may include severe dysphoria, craving for another opiate dose, irritability, sweating, nausea, rhinorrea, tremor, vomiting and myalgia. Slowly reducing the intake of opioids over days and weeks can reduce or eliminate the withdrawal symptoms. The speed and severity of withdrawal depends on the half-life of the opioid; heroin and morphine withdrawal occur more quickly than methadone withdrawal. The acute withdrawal phase is often followed by a protracted phase of depression and insomnia that can last for months. The symptoms of opioid withdrawal can be treated with other medications, such as clonidine. Physical dependence does not predict drug misuse or true addiction, and is closely related to the same mechanism as tolerance. While there is anecdotal claims of benefit with ibogaine, data to support its use in substance dependence is poor.

Critical patients who received regular doses of opioids experience iatrogenic withdrawal as a frequent syndrome.

====Addiction====
Drug addiction is a complex set of behaviors typically associated with misuse of certain drugs, developing over time and with higher drug dosages. Addiction includes psychological compulsion, to the extent that the affected person persists in actions leading to dangerous or unhealthy outcomes. Opioid addiction includes insufflation or injection, rather than taking opioids orally as prescribed for medical reasons.

In European nations such as Austria, Bulgaria, and Slovakia, slow-release oral morphine formulations are used in opiate substitution therapy (OST) for patients who do not well tolerate the side effects of buprenorphine or methadone. Buprenorphine can also be used together with naloxone for a longer treatment of addiction. In other European countries including the UK, this is also legally used for OST although on a varying scale of acceptance.

Slow-release formulations of medications are intended to curb misuse and lower addiction rates while trying to still provide legitimate pain relief and ease of use to pain patients. Questions remain, however, about the efficacy and safety of these types of preparations. Further tamper resistant medications are currently under consideration with trials for market approval by the FDA.

The amount of evidence available only permits making a weak conclusion, but it suggests that a physician properly managing opioid use in patients with no history of substance use disorder can give long-term pain relief with little risk of developing addiction, or other serious side effects.

Problems with opioids include the following:

# Some people find that opioids do not relieve all of their pain.
# Some people find that opioids side effects cause problems which outweigh the therapy&#x27;s benefit.
# Some people build tolerance to opioids over time. This requires them to increase their drug dosage to maintain the benefit, and that in turn also increases the unwanted side effects.
# Long-term opioid use can cause opioid-induced hyperalgesia, which is a condition in which the patient has increased sensitivity to pain.

All of the opioids can cause side effects. Common adverse reactions in patients taking opioids for pain relief include nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, itching, dry mouth, dizziness, and constipation.

===Nausea and vomiting===
Tolerance to nausea occurs within 7–10 days, during which antiemetics (&quot;e.g.&quot; low dose haloperidol once at night) are very effective. Due to severe side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, haloperidol is now rarely used. A related drug, prochlorperazine is more often used, although it has similar risks. Stronger antiemetics such as ondansetron or tropisetron are sometimes used when nausea is severe or continuous and disturbing, despite their greater cost. A less expensive alternative is dopamine antagonists such as domperidone and metoclopramide. Domperidone does not cross the blood–brain barrier and produce adverse central antidopaminergic effects, but blocks opioid emetic action in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This drug is not available in the U.S. 

Some antihistamines with anticholinergic properties (e.g. orphenadrine, diphenhydramine) may also be effective. The first-generation antihistamine hydroxyzine is very commonly used, with the added advantages of not causing movement disorders, and also possessing analgesic-sparing properties. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol relieves nausea and vomiting; it also produces analgesia that may allow lower doses of opioids with reduced nausea and vomiting.
* 5-HT3 antagonists (&quot;e.g.&quot; ondansetron)
* Dopamine antagonists (&quot;e.g.&quot; domperidone)
* Anti-cholinergic antihistamines (&quot;e.g.&quot; diphenhydramine)
* Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (&quot;e.g.&quot; dronabinol)

Vomiting is due to gastric stasis (large volume vomiting, brief nausea relieved by vomiting, oesophageal reflux, epigastric fullness, early satiation), besides direct action on the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, the vomiting centre of the brain. Vomiting can thus be prevented by prokinetic agents (&quot;e.g.&quot; domperidone or metoclopramide). If vomiting has already started, these drugs need to be administered by a non-oral route (&quot;e.g.&quot; subcutaneous for metoclopramide, rectally for domperidone).
* Prokinetic agents (&quot;e.g.&quot; domperidone)
* Anti-cholinergic agents (&quot;e.g.&quot; orphenadrine)

Evidence suggests that opioid-inclusive anaesthesia is associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting.

Patients with chronic pain using opioids had small improvements in pain and physically functioning and increased risk of vomiting.

===Drowsiness===
Tolerance to drowsiness usually develops over 5–7 days, but if troublesome, switching to an alternative opioid often helps. Certain opioids such as fentanyl, morphine and diamorphine (heroin) tend to be particularly sedating, while others such as oxycodone, tilidine and meperidine (pethidine) tend to produce comparatively less sedation, but individual patients responses can vary markedly and some degree of trial and error may be needed to find the most suitable drug for a particular patient. Otherwise, treatment with CNS stimulants is generally effective.
* Stimulants (&quot;e.g.&quot; caffeine, modafinil, amphetamine, methylphenidate)

===Itching===
Itching tends not to be a severe problem when opioids are used for pain relief, but antihistamines are useful for counteracting itching when it occurs. Non-sedating antihistamines such as fexofenadine are often preferred as they avoid increasing opioid induced drowsiness. However, some sedating antihistamines such as orphenadrine can produce a synergistic pain relieving effect permitting smaller doses of opioids be used. Consequently, several opioid/antihistamine combination products have been marketed, such as &quot;Meprozine&quot; (meperidine/promethazine) and &quot;Diconal&quot; (dipipanone/cyclizine), and these may also reduce opioid induced nausea.
* Antihistamines (&quot;e.g.&quot; fexofenadine)

===Constipation===
Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) develops in 90 to 95% of people taking opioids long-term. Since tolerance to this problem does not generally develop, most people on long-term opioids need to take a laxative or enemas.

Treatment of OIC is successional and dependent on severity. The first mode of treatment is non-pharmacological, and includes lifestyle modifications like increasing dietary fiber, fluid intake (around per day), and physical activity. If non-pharmacological measures are ineffective, laxatives, including stool softeners (&quot;e.g.&quot;, polyethylene glycol), bulk-forming laxatives (&quot;e.g.&quot;, fiber supplements), stimulant laxatives (&quot;e.g.&quot;, bisacodyl, senna), and/or enemas, may be used. A common laxative regimen for OIC is the combination of docusate and bisacodyl. Osmotic laxatives, including lactulose, polyethylene glycol, and milk of magnesia (magnesium hydroxide), as well as mineral oil (a lubricant laxative), are also commonly used for OIC.

If laxatives are insufficiently effective (which is often the case), opioid formulations or regimens that include a peripherally-selective opioid antagonist, such as methylnaltrexone bromide, naloxegol, alvimopan, or naloxone (as in oxycodone/naloxone), may be tried. A 2018 (updated in 2022) Cochrane review found that the evidence was moderate for alvimopan, naloxone, or methylnaltrexone bromide but with increased risk of adverse events. Naloxone by mouth appears to be the most effective. A daily 0.2 mg dose of naldemedine has been shown to significantly improve symptoms in patients with OIC.

Opioid rotation is one method suggested to minimise the impact of constipation in long-term users. While all opioids cause constipation, there are some differences between drugs, with studies suggesting tramadol, tapentadol, methadone and fentanyl may cause relatively less constipation, while with codeine, morphine, oxycodone or hydromorphone constipation may be comparatively more severe.

===Respiratory depression===
Respiratory depression is the most serious adverse reaction associated with opioid use, but it usually is seen with the use of a single, intravenous dose in an opioid-naïve patient. In patients taking opioids regularly for pain relief, tolerance to respiratory depression occurs rapidly, so that it is not a clinical problem. Several drugs have been developed which can partially block respiratory depression, although the only respiratory stimulant currently approved for this purpose is doxapram, which has only limited efficacy in this application. Newer drugs such as BIMU-8 and CX-546 may be much more effective.
* Respiratory stimulants: carotid chemoreceptor agonists (&quot;e.g.&quot; doxapram), 5-HT4 agonists (&quot;e.g.&quot; BIMU8), δ-opioid agonists (&quot;e.g.&quot; BW373U86) and AMPAkines (&quot;e.g.&quot; CX717) can all reduce respiratory depression caused by opioids without affecting analgesia, but most of these drugs are only moderately effective or have side effects which preclude use in humans. 5-HT1A agonists such as 8-OH-DPAT and repinotan also counteract opioid-induced respiratory depression, but at the same time reduce analgesia, which limits their usefulness for this application.
* Opioid antagonists (&quot;e.g.&quot; naloxone, nalmefene, diprenorphine)

The initial 24 hours after opioid administration appear to be the most critical with regard to life-threatening OIRD, but may be preventable with a more cautious approach to opioid use.

Patients with cardiac, respiratory disease and/or obstructive sleep apnoea are at increased risk for OIRD.

===Increased pain sensitivity===
Opioid-induced hyperalgesia – where individuals using opioids to relieve pain paradoxically experience more pain as a result of that medication – has been observed in some people. This phenomenon, although uncommon, is seen in some people receiving palliative care, most often when dose is increased rapidly. If encountered, rotation between several different opioid pain medications may decrease the development of increased pain. Opioid induced hyperalgesia more commonly occurs with chronic use or brief high doses but some research suggests that it may also occur with very low doses.

Side effects such as hyperalgesia and allodynia, sometimes accompanied by a worsening of neuropathic pain, may be consequences of long-term treatment with opioid analgesics, especially when increasing tolerance has resulted in loss of efficacy and consequent progressive dose escalation over time. This appears to largely be a result of actions of opioid drugs at targets other than the three classic opioid receptors, including the nociceptin receptor, sigma receptor and Toll-like receptor 4, and can be counteracted in animal models by antagonists at these targets such as J-113,397, BD-1047 or (+)-naloxone respectively. No drugs are currently approved specifically for counteracting opioid-induced hyperalgesia in humans and in severe cases the only solution may be to discontinue use of opioid analgesics and replace them with non-opioid analgesic drugs. However, since individual sensitivity to the development of this side effect is highly dose dependent and may vary depending which opioid analgesic is used, many patients can avoid this side effect simply through dose reduction of the opioid drug (usually accompanied by the addition of a supplemental non-opioid analgesic), rotating between different opioid drugs, or by switching to a milder opioid with a mixed mode of action that also counteracts neuropathic pain, particularly tramadol or tapentadol.

* NMDA receptor antagonists such as ketamine
* SNRIs such as milnacipran
* Anticonvulsants such as gabapentin or pregabalin

=== Other adverse effects ===

====Low sex hormone levels====
Clinical studies have consistently associated medical and recreational opioid use with hypogonadism (low sex hormone levels) in different sexes. The effect is dose-dependent. Most studies suggest that the majority (perhaps as much as 90%) of chronic opioid users develop hypogonadism. A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis found that opioid therapy suppressed testosterone levels in men by about 165 ng/dL (5.7 nmol/L) on average, which was a reduction in testosterone level of almost 50%. Conversely, opioid therapy did not significantly affect testosterone levels in women. However, opioids can also interfere with menstruation in women by limiting the production of luteinizing hormone (LH). Opioid-induced hypogonadism likely causes the strong association of opioid use with osteoporosis and bone fracture, due to deficiency in estradiol. It also may increase pain and thereby interfere with the intended clinical effect of opioid treatment. Opioid-induced hypogonadism is likely caused by their agonism of opioid receptors in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. One study found that the depressed testosterone levels of heroin addicts returned to normal within one month of abstinence, suggesting that the effect is readily reversible and is not permanent. , the effect of low-dose or acute opioid use on the endocrine system is unclear. Long-term use of opioids can affect the other hormonal systems as well.

====Disruption of work====
Use of opioids may be a risk factor for failing to return to work.

Persons performing any safety-sensitive task should not use opioids. Health care providers should not recommend that workers who drive or use heavy equipment including cranes or forklifts treat chronic or acute pain with opioids. Workplaces which manage workers who perform safety-sensitive operations should assign workers to less sensitive duties for so long as those workers are treated by their physician with opioids.

People who take opioids long term have increased likelihood of being unemployed. Taking opioids may further disrupt the patient&#x27;s life and the adverse effects of opioids themselves can become a significant barrier to patients having an active life, gaining employment, and sustaining a career.

In addition, lack of employment may be a predictor of aberrant use of prescription opioids.

====Increased accident-proneness====
Opioid use may increase accident-proneness. Opioids may increase risk of traffic accidents and accidental falls.

Reduced Attention

Opioids have been shown to reduce attention, more so when used with antidepressants and/or anticonvulsants.

====Rare side effects====
Infrequent adverse reactions in patients taking opioids for pain relief include: dose-related respiratory depression (especially with more potent opioids), confusion, hallucinations, delirium, urticaria, hypothermia, bradycardia/tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, headache, urinary retention, ureteric or biliary spasm, muscle rigidity, myoclonus (with high doses), and flushing (due to histamine release, except fentanyl and remifentanil). Both therapeutic and chronic use of opioids can compromise the function of the immune system. Opioids decrease the proliferation of macrophage progenitor cells and lymphocytes, and affect cell differentiation (Roy &amp; Loh, 1996). Opioids may also inhibit leukocyte migration. However the relevance of this in the context of pain relief is not known.

==== Pregnancy ====
== Interactions ==

Physicians treating patients using opioids in combination with other drugs keep continual documentation that further treatment is indicated and remain aware of opportunities to adjust treatment if the patient&#x27;s condition changes to merit less risky therapy.

===With other depressant drugs===
The concurrent use of opioids with other depressant drugs such as benzodiazepines or ethanol increases the rates of adverse events and overdose. Despite this, opioids and benzodiazepines are concurrently dispensed in many settings. As with an overdose of opioid alone, the combination of an opioid and another depressant may precipitate respiratory depression often leading to death. These risks are lessened with close monitoring by a physician, who may conduct ongoing screening for changes in patient behavior and treatment compliance.

===Opioid antagonist===
Opioid effects (adverse or otherwise) can be reversed with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone or naltrexone. These competitive antagonists bind to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists but do not activate the receptors. This displaces the agonist, attenuating or reversing the agonist effects. However, the elimination half-life of naloxone can be shorter than that of the opioid itself, so repeat dosing or continuous infusion may be required, or a longer acting antagonist such as nalmefene may be used. In patients taking opioids regularly it is essential that the opioid is only partially reversed to avoid a severe and distressing reaction of waking in excruciating pain. This is achieved by not giving a full dose but giving this in small doses until the respiratory rate has improved. An infusion is then started to keep the reversal at that level, while maintaining pain relief. Opioid antagonists remain the standard treatment for respiratory depression following opioid overdose, with naloxone being by far the most commonly used, although the longer acting antagonist nalmefene may be used for treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as methadone, and diprenorphine is used for reversing the effects of extremely potent opioids used in veterinary medicine such as etorphine and carfentanil. However, since opioid antagonists also block the beneficial effects of opioid analgesics, they are generally useful only for treating overdose, with use of opioid antagonists alongside opioid analgesics to reduce side effects, requiring careful dose titration and often being poorly effective at doses low enough to allow analgesia to be maintained.

Naltrexone does not appear to increase risk of serious adverse events, which confirms the safety of oral naltrexone. Mortality or serious adverse events due to rebound toxicity in patients with naloxone were rare.

==Pharmacology==
Opioids bind to specific opioid receptors in the nervous system and other tissues. There are three principal classes of opioid receptors, μ, κ, δ (mu, kappa, and delta), although up to seventeen have been reported, and include the ε, ι, λ, and ζ (Epsilon, Iota, Lambda and Zeta) receptors. Conversely, σ (Sigma) receptors are no longer considered to be opioid receptors because their activation is not reversed by the opioid inverse-agonist naloxone, they do not exhibit high-affinity binding for classical opioids, and they are stereoselective for dextro-rotatory isomers while the other opioid receptors are stereo-selective for levo-rotatory isomers. In addition, there are three subtypes of μ-receptor: μ1 and μ2, and the newly discovered μ3. Another receptor of clinical importance is the opioid-receptor-like receptor 1 (ORL1), which is involved in pain responses as well as having a major role in the development of tolerance to μ-opioid agonists used as analgesics. These are all G-protein coupled receptors acting on GABAergic neurotransmission.

The pharmacodynamic response to an opioid depends upon the receptor to which it binds, its affinity for that receptor, and whether the opioid is an agonist or an antagonist. For example, the supraspinal analgesic properties of the opioid agonist morphine are mediated by activation of the μ1 receptor; respiratory depression and physical dependence by the μ2 receptor; and sedation and spinal analgesia by the κ receptor. Each group of opioid receptors elicits a distinct set of neurological responses, with the receptor subtypes (such as μ1 and μ2 for example) providing even more [measurably] specific responses. Unique to each opioid is its distinct binding affinity to the various classes of opioid receptors (&quot;e.g.&quot; the μ, κ, and δ opioid receptors are activated at different magnitudes according to the specific receptor binding affinities of the opioid). For example, the opiate alkaloid morphine exhibits high-affinity binding to the μ-opioid receptor, while ketazocine exhibits high affinity to ĸ receptors. It is this combinatorial mechanism that allows for such a wide class of opioids and molecular designs to exist, each with its own unique effect profile. Their individual molecular structure is also responsible for their different duration of action, whereby metabolic breakdown (such as &quot;N&quot;-dealkylation) is responsible for opioid metabolism.

===Functional selectivity===
A new strategy of drug development takes receptor signal transduction into consideration. This strategy strives to increase the activation of desirable signalling pathways while reducing the impact on undesirable pathways. This differential strategy has been given several names, including functional selectivity and biased agonism. The first opioid that was intentionally designed as a biased agonist and placed into clinical evaluation is the drug oliceridine. It displays analgesic activity and reduced adverse effects.

===Opioid comparison===
Extensive research has been conducted to determine equivalence ratios comparing the relative potency of opioids. Given a dose of an opioid, an equianalgesic table is used to find the equivalent dosage of another. Such tables are used in opioid rotation practices, and to describe an opioid by comparison to morphine, the reference opioid. Equianalgesic tables typically list drug half-lives, and sometimes equianalgesic doses of the same drug by means of administration, such as morphine: oral and intravenous.

===Binding profiles===
==Usage==

Opioid prescriptions in the US increased from 76 million in 1991 to 207 million in 2013.

In the 1990s, opioid prescribing increased significantly. Once used almost exclusively for the treatment of acute pain or pain due to cancer, opioids are now prescribed liberally for people experiencing chronic pain. This has been accompanied by rising rates of accidental addiction and accidental overdoses leading to death. According to the International Narcotics Control Board, the United States and Canada lead the per capita consumption of prescription opioids. The number of opioid prescriptions per capita in the United States and Canada is double the consumption in the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand. Certain populations have been affected by the opioid addiction crisis more than others, including First World communities and low-income populations. Public health specialists say that this may result from the unavailability or high cost of alternative methods for addressing chronic pain. Opioids have been described as a cost-effective treatment for chronic pain, but the impact of the opioid epidemic and deaths caused by opioid overdoses should be considered in assessing their cost-effectiveness. Data from 2017 suggest that in the U.S. about 3.4 percent of the U.S. population are prescribed opioids for daily pain management. Calls for opioid deprescribing have led to broad scale opioid tapering practices with little scientific evidence to support the safety or benefit for patients with chronic pain. 
==History==
=== Naturally occurring opioids ===

Opioids are among the world&#x27;s oldest known drugs. The earliest known evidence of &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; in a human archaeological site dates to the Neolithic period around 5,700–5,500 BCE. Its seeds have been found at Cueva de los Murciélagos in the Iberian Peninsula and La Marmotta in the Italian Peninsula.

Use of the opium poppy for medical, recreational, and religious purposes can be traced to the fourth century BC, when ideograms on Sumerians clay tablets mention the use of &quot;Hul Gil&quot;, a &quot;plant of joy&quot;.
Opium was known to the Egyptians, and is mentioned in the Ebers Papyrus as an ingredient in a mixture for the soothing of children, and for the treatment of breast abscesses.

Opium was also known to the Greeks. 
It was valued by Hippocrates ( – ) and his students for its sleep-inducing properties, and used for the treatment of pain. The Latin saying &quot;Sedare dolorem opus divinum est&quot;, trans. &quot;Alleviating pain is the work of the divine&quot;, has been variously ascribed to Hippocrates and to Galen of Pergamum. The medical use of opium is later discussed by Pedanius Dioscorides ( – 90 AD), a Greek physician serving in the Roman army, in his five-volume work, &quot;De Materia Medica&quot;.

During the Islamic Golden Age, the use of opium was discussed in detail by Avicenna ( – June 1037 AD) in &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;. The book&#x27;s five volumes include information on opium&#x27;s preparation, an array of physical effects, its use to treat a variety of illness, contraindications for its use, its potential danger as a poison and its potential for addiction. Avicenna discouraged opium&#x27;s use except as a last resort, preferring to address the causes of pain rather than trying to minimize it with analgesics. Many of Avicenna&#x27;s observations have been supported by modern medical research.

Exactly when the world became aware of opium in India and China is uncertain, but opium was mentioned in the Chinese medical work &quot;K&#x27;ai-pao-pen-tsdo&quot; (973 AD) By 1590 AD, opium poppies were a staple spring crop in the Subahs of Agra region.

The physician Paracelsus (–1541) is often credited with reintroducing opium into medical use in Western Europe, during the German Renaissance. He extolled opium&#x27;s benefits for medical use. He also claimed to have an &quot;arcanum&quot;, a pill which he called laudanum, that was superior to all others, particularly when death was to be cheated. (&quot;Ich hab&#x27; ein Arcanum – heiss&#x27; ich Laudanum, ist über das Alles, wo es zum Tode reichen will.&quot;) Later writers have asserted that Paracelsus&#x27; recipe for laudanum contained opium, but its composition remains unknown.

=== Laudanum ===
The term laudanum was used generically for a useful medicine until the 17th century. After Thomas Sydenham introduced the first liquid tincture of opium, &quot;laudanum&quot; came to mean a mixture of both opium and alcohol. 
Sydenham&#x27;s 1669 recipe for laudanum mixed opium with wine, saffron, clove and cinnamon. Sydenham&#x27;s laudanum was used widely in both Europe and the Americas until the 20th century. 
Other popular medicines, based on opium, included Paregoric, a much milder liquid preparation for children; Black-drop, a stronger preparation; and Dover&#x27;s powder.

=== The opium trade ===
Opium became a major colonial commodity, moving legally and illegally through trade networks involving India, the Portuguese, the Dutch, the British and China, among others.
The British East India Company saw the opium trade as an investment opportunity in 1683 AD. In 1773 the Governor of Bengal established a monopoly on the production of Bengal opium, on behalf of the East India Company. The cultivation and manufacture of Indian opium was further centralized and controlled through a series of acts, between 1797 and 1949. The British balanced an economic deficit from the importation of Chinese tea by selling Indian opium which was smuggled into China in defiance of Chinese government bans. This led to the First (1839–1842) and Second Opium Wars (1856–1860) between China and Britain.

=== Morphine ===
In the 19th century, two major scientific advances were made that had far-reaching effects. Around 1804, German pharmacist Friedrich Sertürner isolated morphine from opium. He described its crystallization, structure, and pharmacological properties in a well-received paper in 1817. 
Morphine was the first alkaloid to be isolated from any medicinal plant, the beginning of modern scientific drug discovery.

The second advance, nearly fifty years later, was the refinement of the hypodermic needle by Alexander Wood and others. Development of a glass syringe with a subcutaneous needle made it possible to easily administer controlled measurable doses of a primary active compound.

Morphine was initially hailed as a wonder drug for its ability to ease pain. It could help people sleep, and had other useful side effects, including control of coughing and diarrhea. It was widely prescribed by doctors, and dispensed without restriction by pharmacists. During the American Civil War, opium and laudanum were used extensively to treat soldiers. It was also prescribed frequently for women, for menstrual pain and diseases of a &quot;nervous character&quot;.
At first it was assumed (wrongly) that this new method of application would not be addictive.

===Codeine===
Codeine was discovered in 1832 by Pierre Jean Robiquet. Robiquet was reviewing a method for morphine extraction, described by Scottish chemist William Gregory (1803–1858). Processing the residue left from Gregory&#x27;s procedure, Robiquet isolated a crystalline substance from the other active components of opium. He wrote of his discovery: &quot;Here is a new substance found in opium ... We know that morphine, which so far has been thought to be the only active principle of opium, does not account for all the effects and for a long time the physiologists are claiming that there is a gap that has to be filled.&quot; His discovery of the alkaloid led to the development of a generation of antitussive and antidiarrheal medicines based on codeine.

=== Semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids ===
Synthetic opioids were invented, and biological mechanisms for their actions discovered, in the 20th century. Scientists have searched for non-addictive forms of opioids, but have created stronger ones instead. In England Charles Romley Alder Wright developed hundreds of opiate compounds in his search for a nonaddictive opium derivative. In 1874 he became the first person to synthesize diamorphine (heroin), using a process called acetylation which involved boiling morphine with acetic anhydride for several hours.

Heroin received little attention until it was independently synthesized by Felix Hoffmann (1868–1946), working for Heinrich Dreser (1860–1924) at Bayer Laboratories. Dreser brought the new drug to market as an analgesic and a cough treatment for tuberculosis, bronchitis, and asthma in 1898. Bayer ceased production in 1913, after heroin&#x27;s addictive potential was recognized.

Several semi-synthetic opioids were developed in Germany in the 1910s. The first, oxymorphone, was synthesized from thebaine, an opioid alkaloid in opium poppies, in 1914.
Next, Martin Freund and Edmund Speyer developed oxycodone, also from thebaine, at the University of Frankfurt in 1916.
In 1920, hydrocodone was prepared by Carl Mannich and Helene Löwenheim, deriving it from codeine. In 1924, hydromorphone was synthesized by adding hydrogen to morphine. Etorphine was synthesized in 1960, from the oripavine in opium poppy straw. Buprenorphine was discovered in 1972.

The first fully synthetic opioid was meperidine (Demerol), found serendipitously by German chemist Otto Eisleb (or Eislib) at IG Farben in 1932. Meperidine was the first opioid to have a structure unrelated to morphine, but with opioid-like properties. Its analgesic effects were discovered by Otto Schaumann in 1939.
Gustav Ehrhart and Max Bockmühl, also at IG Farben, 
built on the work of Eisleb and Schaumann. They developed &quot;Hoechst 10820&quot; (later methadone) around 1937.
In 1959 the Belgian physician Paul Janssen developed fentanyl, a synthetic opioid with 30 to 50 times the potency of heroin.
Nearly 150 synthetic opioids are now known.

=== Criminalization and medical use ===
Non-clinical use of opium was criminalized in the United States by the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914, and by many other laws. The use of opioids was stigmatized, and it was seen as a dangerous substance, to be prescribed only as a last resort for dying patients. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 eventually relaxed the harshness of the Harrison Act.

In the United Kingdom the 1926 report of the Departmental Committee on Morphine and Heroin Addiction under the Chairmanship of the President of the Royal College of Physicians reasserted medical control and established the &quot;British system&quot; of control—which lasted until the 1960s.

In the 1980s the World Health Organization published guidelines for prescribing drugs, including opioids, for different levels of pain. In the U.S., Kathleen Foley and Russell Portenoy became leading advocates for the liberal use of opioids as painkillers for cases of &quot;intractable non-malignant pain&quot;.
With little or no scientific evidence to support their claims, industry scientists and advocates suggested that people with chronic pain would be resistant to addiction.

The release of OxyContin in 1996 was accompanied by an aggressive marketing campaign promoting the use of opioids for pain relief. Increasing prescription of opioids fueled a growing black market for heroin. Between 2000 and 2014 there was an &quot;alarming increase in heroin use across the country and an epidemic of drug overdose deaths&quot;.

As a result, health care organizations and public health groups, such as Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, have called for decreases in the prescription of opioids. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a new set of guidelines for the prescription of opioids &quot;for chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care&quot; and the increase of opioid tapering.

=== &quot;Remove the Risk&quot; ===
In April 2019 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the launch of a new education campaign to help Americans understand the important role they play in removing and properly disposing of unused prescription opioids from their homes. This new initiative is part of the FDA&#x27;s continued efforts to address the nationwide opioid crisis (see below) and aims to help decrease unnecessary exposure to opioids and prevent new addiction. The &quot;Remove the Risk&quot; campaign is targeting women ages 35–64, who are most likely to oversee household health care decisions and often serve as the gatekeepers to opioids and other prescription medications in the home.

==Society and culture==
===Definition===

The term &quot;opioid&quot; originated in the 1950s. It combines &quot;opium&quot; + &quot;-oid&quot; meaning &quot;opiate-like&quot; (&quot;opiates&quot; being morphine and similar drugs derived from opium). The first scientific publication to use it, in 1963, included a footnote stating, &quot;In this paper, the term, &#x27;opioid&#x27;, is used in the sense originally proposed by George H. Acheson (personal communication) to refer to any chemical compound with morphine-like activities&quot;. By the late 1960s, research found that opiate effects are mediated by activation of specific molecular receptors in the nervous system, which were termed &quot;opioid receptors&quot;. The definition of &quot;opioid&quot; was later refined to refer to substances that have morphine-like activities that are mediated by the activation of opioid receptors. One modern pharmacology textbook states: &quot;the term opioid applies to all agonists and antagonists with morphine-like activity, and also the naturally occurring and synthetic opioid peptides&quot;. Another pharmacology reference eliminates the &quot;morphine-like&quot; requirement: &quot;Opioid, a more modern term, is used to designate all substances, both natural and synthetic, that bind to opioid receptors (including antagonists)&quot;. Some sources define the term &quot;opioid&quot; to exclude &quot;opiates&quot;, and others use &quot;opiate&quot; comprehensively instead of &quot;opioid&quot;, but &quot;opioid&quot; used inclusively is considered modern, preferred and is in wide use.

===Efforts to reduce recreational use in the US===
In 2011, the Obama administration released a white paper describing the administration&#x27;s plan to deal with the opioid crisis. The administration&#x27;s concerns about addiction and accidental overdosing have been echoed by numerous other medical and government advisory groups around the world.

As of 2015, prescription drug monitoring programs exist in every state, except for Missouri. These programs allow pharmacists and prescribers to access patients&#x27; prescription histories in order to identify suspicious use. However, a survey of US physicians published in 2015 found that only 53% of doctors used these programs, while 22% were not aware that the programs were available to them. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was tasked with establishing and publishing a new guideline, and was heavily lobbied. In 2016, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published its Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain, recommending that opioids only be used when benefits for pain and function are expected to outweigh risks, and then used at the lowest effective dosage, with avoidance of concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use whenever possible. Research suggests that the prescription of high doses of opioids related to chronic opioid therapy (COT) can at times be prevented through state legislative guidelines and efforts by health plans that devote resources and establish shared expectations for reducing higher doses.

On 10 August 2017, Donald Trump declared the opioid crisis a (non-FEMA) national public health emergency.

===Global shortages===
Morphine and other poppy-based medicines have been identified by the World Health Organization as essential in the treatment of severe pain. As of 2002, seven countries (USA, UK, Italy, Australia, France, Spain and Japan) use 77% of the world&#x27;s morphine supplies, leaving many emerging countries lacking in pain relief medication. The current system of supply of raw poppy materials to make poppy-based medicines is regulated by the International Narcotics Control Board under the provision of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. The amount of raw poppy materials that each country can demand annually based on these provisions must correspond to an estimate of the country&#x27;s needs taken from the national consumption within the preceding two years. In many countries, underprescription of morphine is rampant because of the high prices and the lack of training in the prescription of poppy-based drugs. The World Health Organization is now working with administrations from various countries to train healthworkers and to develop national regulations regarding drug prescription to facilitate a greater prescription of poppy-based medicines.

Another idea to increase morphine availability is proposed by the Senlis Council, who suggest, through their proposal for Afghan Morphine, that Afghanistan could provide cheap pain relief solutions to emerging countries as part of a second-tier system of supply that would complement the current INCB regulated system by maintaining the balance and closed system that it establishes while providing finished product morphine to those in severe pain and unable to access poppy-based drugs under the current system.

===Recreational use===
Opioids can produce strong feelings of euphoria and are frequently used recreationally. Traditionally associated with illicit opioids such as heroin, prescription opioids are misused recreationally.

Drug misuse and non-medical use include the use of drugs for reasons or at doses other than prescribed. Opioid misuse can also include providing medications to persons for whom it was not prescribed. Such diversion may be treated as crimes, punishable by imprisonment in many countries. In 2014, almost 2 million Americans abused or were dependent on prescription opioids.

==Classification==
There are a number of broad classes of opioids:
* Natural opiates: alkaloids contained in the resin of the opium poppy, primarily morphine, codeine, and thebaine, but not papaverine and noscapine which have a different mechanism of action
* Esters of morphine opiates: slightly chemically altered but more natural than the semi-synthetics, as most are morphine prodrugs, diacetylmorphine (morphine diacetate; heroin), nicomorphine (morphine dinicotinate), dipropanoylmorphine (morphine dipropionate), desomorphine, acetylpropionylmorphine, dibenzoylmorphine, diacetyldihydromorphine;
* Semi-synthetic opioids: created from either the natural opiates or morphine esters, such as hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxycodone, oxymorphone, ethylmorphine and buprenorphine;
* Fully synthetic opioids: such as fentanyl, pethidine, levorphanol, methadone, tramadol, tapentadol, and dextropropoxyphene;
* Endogenous opioid peptides, produced naturally in the body, such as endorphins, enkephalins, dynorphins, and endomorphins.
* Endogenous opioids, non-peptide: Morphine, and some other opioids, which are produced in small amounts in the body, are included in this category.
* Natural opioids, non-animal, non-opiate: the leaves from Mitragyna speciosa (kratom) contain a few naturally-occurring opioids, active via Mu- and Delta receptors. Salvinorin A, found naturally in the Salvia divinorum plant, is a kappa-opioid receptor agonist.

Tramadol and tapentadol, which act as monoamine uptake inhibitors also act as mild and potent agonists (respectively) of the μ-opioid receptor. Both drugs produce analgesia even when naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is administered.

Some minor opium alkaloids and various substances with opioid action are also found elsewhere, including molecules present in kratom, &quot;Corydalis&quot;, and &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot; plants and some species of poppy aside from &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;. There are also strains which produce copious amounts of thebaine, an important raw material for making many semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids. Of all of the more than 120 poppy species, only two produce morphine.

Amongst analgesics there are a small number of agents which act on the central nervous system but not on the opioid receptor system and therefore have none of the other (narcotic) qualities of opioids although they may produce euphoria by relieving pain—a euphoria that, because of the way it is produced, does not form the basis of habituation, physical dependence, or addiction. Foremost amongst these are nefopam, orphenadrine, and perhaps phenyltoloxamine or some other antihistamines. Tricyclic antidepressants have painkilling effect as well, but they&#x27;re thought to do so by indirectly activating the endogenous opioid system. Paracetamol is predominantly a centrally acting analgesic (non-narcotic) which mediates its effect by action on descending serotoninergic (5-hydroxy triptaminergic) pathways, to increase 5-HT release (which inhibits release of pain mediators). It also decreases cyclo-oxygenase activity. It has recently been discovered that most or all of the therapeutic efficacy of paracetamol is due to a metabolite, AM404, which enhances the release of serotonin and inhibits the uptake of anandamide.

Other analgesics work peripherally (&quot;i.e.&quot;, not on the brain or spinal cord). Research is starting to show that morphine and related drugs may indeed have peripheral effects as well, such as morphine gel working on burns. Recent investigations discovered opioid receptors on peripheral sensory neurons. A significant fraction (up to 60%) of opioid analgesia can be mediated by such peripheral opioid receptors, particularly in inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, traumatic or surgical pain. Inflammatory pain is also blunted by endogenous opioid peptides activating peripheral opioid receptors.

It was discovered in 1953, that humans and some animals naturally produce minute amounts of morphine, codeine, and possibly some of their simpler derivatives like heroin and dihydromorphine, in addition to endogenous opioid peptides. Some bacteria are capable of producing some semi-synthetic opioids such as hydromorphone and hydrocodone when living in a solution containing morphine or codeine respectively.

Many of the alkaloids and other derivatives of the opium poppy are not opioids or narcotics; the best example is the smooth-muscle relaxant papaverine. Noscapine is a marginal case as it does have CNS effects but not necessarily similar to morphine, and it is probably in a category all its own.

Dextromethorphan (the stereoisomer of levomethorphan, a semi-synthetic opioid agonist) and its metabolite dextrorphan have no opioid analgesic effect at all despite their structural similarity to other opioids; instead they are potent NMDA antagonists and sigma 1 and 2-receptor agonists and are used in many over-the-counter cough suppressants.

Salvinorin A is a unique selective, powerful ĸ-opioid receptor agonist. It is not properly considered an opioid nevertheless, because:
# chemically, it is not an alkaloid; and
# it has no typical opioid properties: absolutely no anxiolytic or cough-suppressant effects. It is instead a powerful hallucinogen.


===Endogenous opioids===

Opioid-peptides that are produced in the body include:

* Endorphins
* Enkephalins
* Dynorphins
* Endomorphins

β-endorphin is expressed in Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) cells in the arcuate nucleus, in the brainstem and in immune cells, and acts through μ-opioid receptors. β-endorphin has many effects, including on sexual behavior and appetite. β-endorphin is also secreted into the circulation from pituitary corticotropes and melanotropes. α-neoendorphin is also expressed in POMC cells in the arcuate nucleus.

Met-enkephalin is widely distributed in the CNS and in immune cells; [met]-enkephalin is a product of the proenkephalin gene, and acts through μ and δ-opioid receptors. leu-enkephalin, also a product of the proenkephalin gene, acts through δ-opioid receptors.

Dynorphin acts through κ-opioid receptors, and is widely distributed in the CNS, including in the spinal cord and hypothalamus, including in particular the arcuate nucleus and in both oxytocin and vasopressin neurons in the supraoptic nucleus.

Endomorphin acts through μ-opioid receptors, and is more potent than other endogenous opioids at these receptors.

<doc id="511397" wikidata="Q1194966" url="?curid=511397" title="Wink">
<text>A wink is a facial expression made by briefly closing one eye. A wink is an informal mode of non-verbal communication usually signaling shared hidden knowledge or intent. However, it is ambiguous by itself and highly dependent upon additional context, without which a wink could become misinterpreted or even nonsensical. For example, in some regions of the world, a wink may be considered rude or offensive. Depending on the relationship of the people involved, a wink could possibly constitute a sexual gesture.

==General overview and meanings==
Winking is one of the more subtle gestures, usually involving eye contact between those involved. In most cases it is only meant to be known by the sender and their intended receivers, but in some cases can be more widely intended.

===Single wink===

A single wink is usually a friendly gesture implying a degree of solidarity or intimacy.

A typical use of the wink is to quietly send a message that third parties are not aware of. For example, while person A is lying to person B or deliberately teasing them, they might wink at person C as a means of indicating the fact to C and incorporating them in the &quot;conspiracy&quot;. Alternatively, if person A is joking or teasing person B in a friendly way, person A may wink directly at person B as a way to suggest to them that their own (A&#x27;s) words are to be taken as a joke. It is also possible for person A to use winking in order to secretly imply to person B that the words or actions of some third party should not be taken seriously (for example, because the third party is joking or lying).

A wink could also be used as a somewhat humorous way to express sympathy, solidarity, and encouragement, especially when the winker is trying to put the receiver at ease in a situation where they might feel nervous or uncomfortable. In such cases a wink has a meaning very similar to that of a &quot;thumbs up&quot;.

In some cultures it is often a sexual interest, or flirtatious manner, during momentary eye contact. This is often followed by a smile and usually a smile from the receiver if it is accepted or approved by them, sometimes combined with blushing if they are embarrassed. A smile from the receiver sometimes—but not always—indicates (sexual) interest in the winker. For example, in the Wodaabe tribe in the Niger area, someone who wants to engage in sexual activities can wink at a person. If the person continues to look at them, they will slightly move their lip corner, showing the way to the bush the person is expected to have sex with them in.

In particularly difficult or strenuous situations, Person A may wink at Person B to non-verbally communicate that Person B can trust Person C. An extreme example of this could be undercover cops when one does something otherwise questionable.

===Double wink ===
Like a single wink but more emphatic, two winks in a row may be used by the sender as a subtle way to imply that something said by the sender, immediately beforehand, was &quot;sneaky&quot;, &quot;tricky&quot;, &quot;misleading&quot;, or &quot;untrue&quot; to the receiver. In English-speaking countries, this has also given rise to the expression of vocally saying &quot;wink wink&quot; while winking—or sometimes while not even winking at all, in which case the sender is not communicating the &quot;trickiness&quot; of their words to a third party, but to the receiver, and is thus signalling that their words should not be taken literally but as a hint or euphemism.

===Both eyes (bat/flutter)===
To close and open, or &quot;wink&quot;, both eyes is usually an involuntary action known as a &quot;blink&quot;. Though if done intentionally, in a particular way (such as once slowly or a few times in a row quickly), while giving a sweet or suggestive look with the eyes, often with the head tilted or at an angle in combination with the shoulders, is known as to &quot;bat an eyelash&quot;, &quot;bat/batting eyelashes&quot;, or &quot;flutter/fluttering eyelashes&quot;. This is done as a way of flirting, showing interest, or in an attempt to persuade the receiver. Depending on the context, it may also be used ironically. For instance, if person A says something outrageous, or obviously a lie. Person B will &quot;bat their eyelash&quot; at person C, letting person C know that they think what person A said was foolish, lazy, obvious, etc.

==Cultural specific differences==

===The Western world (including Eastern Europe and Latin America)===

Winking in Western culture can be used as a way of letting someone else know that the winker or some other person is joking or lying (e.g., a parent tells their child a story about a fairy princess, and then winks at the child&#x27;s older sibling, the sibling thus knows the parent is lying to the younger child). It may also be used to communicate sexual intentions, ranging from flirtation to an explicit invitation.
===Asia===
In China and reportedly to some extent in India, winking to anyone other than family or a friend who a person wishes to have sex with may be seen as an offensive or at least an impolite gesture. This is demonstrated in the commotion caused by Sarah Palin in a number of Asian countries during the 2008 vice presidential debate, where she winked several times while debating Joe Biden. When Frederick Spencer Chapman was training Chinese guerillas in Malaya to shoot rifles, he found that a large proportion of them were unable to close only one eye at a time.

However, winking in the Indian subcontinent often has similar connotations as in the West. It can be used to signal an &quot;inside&quot; joke, a sly gesture shared between two people privately, unbeknownst to those around them, as in a social gathering. It can also be a naughty &quot;come on&quot; towards the attractive sex.

===The Netherlands &amp; Indonesia===
In Netherlands and Indonesia, winking at strangers will generally be perceived as offensive or even as a sexual advance and is unlikely to be appreciated.

===Africa===
West African parents may wink to signal children to leave the room, especially when there is a guest, or another adult coming in. It is considered rude for children to stay in a room where adults or elders want to have a conversation, and so winking is used as a more discreet way to tell the children to leave the room. Parents also try not to embarrass themselves in front of guests, because their children do not understand immediately when it is time to leave the room.

==Noted examples==
*In the famous Monty Python sketch &quot;Nudge Nudge&quot;, a younger man slyly asks an older gentleman about sex through innuendo, reiterating the phrase &quot;nudge nudge wink wink&quot; after his questions in an attempt to indicate that his innocent-sounding questions are intended to be double entendres, i.e., of a sexual nature.
*During the 2008 United States vice-presidential debate, Republican candidate Sarah Palin winked at the audience several times. Her behaviour was considered to be highly unusual in the context of a formal political debate and received considerable media attention. While some conservative pundits defended Palin, other individuals were critical of and even offended by her conduct.
*In online dating, a &#x27;wink&#x27; is a way of communicating approval of another member (sometimes from a non-member) without sending email. It is used at sites such as Match.com.

==Physiological aspects==
Not all humans are able to wink voluntarily, and some can only wink one (usually the non-dominant) eye. Others are far better at winking one eye and find it awkward to wink the other.

==Animal winks==

Animal winks are thought to be just as meaningful as humans&#x27;. Dogs are said to wink as a sign of non-aggression due to the fact they see extended eye contact as a challenge for dominance. So, when dogs don’t want to fight, they will wink/blink in submission. 

Although usually blinking slowly to show affection, cats are also more rarely known to wink to humans and other cats, communicating that it sees the other as trustworthy. This has led some people to refer to this action as a &quot;cat kiss&quot;, since the cat is showing love, like human kisses do.

<doc id="511403" wikidata="Q2420070" url="?curid=511403" title="New Brunswick Route 11">
<text>Route 11 is a provincial highway in northeastern New Brunswick, Canada. The road runs from Moncton to the Quebec border, near Campbellton, at the Matapédia Bridge, following the province&#x27;s eastern and northern coastlines.

Between Shediac Bridge and Miramichi, and between Bathurst and Campbellton, it is a two-lane road with some sections designed as a super two expressway. The highway is twinned for 7 kilometres in the Shediac region near the Route 15 interchange.

== Route description ==
The southern terminus of Route 11 is at an interchange with Route 2 in Moncton, where it begins a concurrency with Route 15 for to Shediac. At Shediac, Route 11 departs Route 15 and turns northward, where its exit numbers are reset. It runs northward, parallel to Route 134 as a four-lane divided highway for , then becomes a super two controlled-access highway. The route passes through the communities of Shediac Cape, intersecting Route 134, and crosses the Shediac River. The highway then enters Cocagne by crossing the Cocagne River. Intersecting with Route 535, the route continues through Ward Corner passing McKees Mills and Saint-François-de-Kent at the intersection of Route 115. The route crosses the Little Bouctouche River, then the Bouctouche River as it enters Bouctouche.

From Bouctouche, Route 11 continues north to Richibucto as well as Kouchibouguac National Park. The highway reverts to a 2-lane uncontrolled access highway between the national park and the city of Miramichi to the northwest. The highway crosses the Miramichi River in the Miramichi borough of Chatham on the Centennial Bridge with Route 8.

Immediately after crossing the Miramichi River, Route 11 exits the right of way, leaving Route 8 alone on the super two. Route 11 continues on a 2-lane uncontrolled access highway northeast along the coast of Miramichi Bay and the Gulf of St. Lawrence as it runs around the perimeter of the Acadian Peninsula. Through this region, Route 11 typically forms the main street through most of the coastal towns and settlements such as Neguac, Caraquet, Bertrand, Grande-Anse, and Stonehaven. The only exception is a Super 2 controlled access bypass of the town of Tracadie-Sheila.

Route 11 has another interchange with Route 8 at Bathurst, where the latter terminates. Route 11 becomes a super two controlled-access highway from Bathurst, running northwest several kilometres inland from the coast of Chaleur Bay to Glencoe, west of the city of Campbellton. Near Glencoe, Route 11 intersects Route 17 and turns north onto a 2-lane local road toward Tide Head. The highway turns west to follow the Restigouche River and terminates at the Matapédia Bridge, which crosses the river and connects to Quebec Route 132 in Matapédia, Quebec.

== History ==
Since the late 1960s, Route 11 has received several upgrades and re-designations as it progresses towards becoming an expressway.

The most significant upgrade to the entire highway route along the east coast of New Brunswick was the opening of the Centennial Bridge which replaced a ferry service and bypassed the town of Chatham in 1967.

In 1973 a new 4-lane expressway opened between Moncton and Shediac, which was then referred to as the Shediac Four-Lane Highway or Shediac Expressway (it was subsequently numbered Route 15 and is known as the Veterans Memorial Highway). Prior to this new expressway, Route 11 followed the Shediac Road from Shediac to Moncton, terminating at Route 2, the Trans-Canada Highway in Lakeville. Route 11&#x27;s southern terminus was then changed to the current interchange at Route 15 in Shediac.

Controlled access Super 2 expressway sections on Route 11 were completed during the 1970s in Bathurst and the Campbellton-Dalhousie area, as well as between Shediac and Bouctouche.

During the 1980s and into the early 1990s, two long stretches of Super 2 expressway were completed on Route 11; one running from Bouctouche to Kouchibouguac National Park (bypassing Richibucto), and another running between Bathurst and Charlo, where the existing Super 2 section running east from Campbellton ended. The Super 2 section in Bathurst was also extended eastward past Salmon Beach at the city&#x27;s east end.

A bypass of Tracadie-Sheila opened to traffic in 2003. Also, an extension to that existing bypass was done in 2009, linking the northern end and Six-Roads, near Pokemouche.

A bypass of Caraquet opened to traffic in 2016. Also going south from exiting Route 11 from Portage Road to Bertrand. The 13 km construction started in 2013, then finished in 2016.

In 2017, work was completed on a new interchange between Route 11 and 15 in Shediac, and 7 kilometres of twinned highway. 

Currently, two other sections of highway are being twinned. The first is from the south side of the Shediac River to the Cocagne River, and the second from the north side of the Cocagne River to the Little Bouctouche River, meaning the highway will revert to two lanes across the Cocagne River on the current bridge.

<text>The 13th Golden Raspberry Awards were held on March 28, 1993, at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel to recognize the worst the movie industry had to offer in 1992. &quot;Shining Through&quot; and &quot;Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot&quot; each won three Razzies, though the latter wasn&#x27;t nominated for Worst Picture. Tom Selleck did not attend the ceremony and later accepted his award on &quot;The Chevy Chase Show&quot;.

Alan Menken, who wrote the music for the Razzie-winning song &quot;High Times, Hard Times&quot; from &quot;Newsies&quot;, also received the Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;A Whole New World&quot; from &quot;Aladdin&quot; in 1993, making him the first person to receive a Razzie and Oscar in the same year, a feat not repeated until screenwriter Brian Helgeland in 1998.

<doc id="511409" wikidata="Q7458556" url="?curid=511409" title="Sexed up">
<text>Sexed up refers to making something more sexually attractive. Since 2003 it has been used in the sense of making something more attractive than it really is by selective presentation; a modern update to the phrase &quot;hyped up&quot;. One variant of &quot;sexed up&quot; is &quot;sex it up&quot;. The implication is that no actual lying is taking place, but that spin is being placed on certain parts of the message.

==History==
The phrase gained currency in the United Kingdom on 29 May 2003, when BBC defence correspondent Andrew Gilligan filed a report for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme in which he stated that an unnamed source, a senior British official, had told him that the September Dossier had been &quot;sexed up&quot;, and that the intelligence agencies were concerned about some highly dubious information contained within it—specifically the claim that Saddam Hussein could deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes of an order. The dubious information was used to make a case for urgent action and to justify the war with Iraq.

==Usage==
*&quot;One event in particular sours many freshman orientations: sexed-up sex-ed.&quot;
*&quot;Some things remain the same, but critics all say that the show was &#x27;sexed up&#x27; by the CW for today&#x27;s audiences.&quot;
*In &quot;The God Delusion&quot;, Richard Dawkins states that pantheism is &quot;sexed up atheism&quot; while &quot;deism is watered-down theism&quot;.

==In music==
*&quot;Sexed Up&quot; is a single released in 2003 by Robbie Williams.

<text>Tooker Gomberg (August 12, 1955 – March 4, 2004) was a Canadian politician and environmental activist. A native of Montreal, Quebec, a graduate of Herzliah High School and a liberal-arts graduate of Hampshire College (1980), Gomberg founded one of Canada&#x27;s first curbside recycling programs in Montreal, and later moved to Edmonton, Alberta, where he created educational materials for Alberta&#x27;s energy ministry and headed the EcoCity Society, an environmental agency. He served on the Edmonton city council from 1992 to 1995.

== Political career ==
In 1992, he was elected to Edmonton&#x27;s city council. In 1995 he ran for re-election but was not elected. It is said his support for high-density development of the Little Brickyard in his home base of Riverdale lost him support among many of the people there. His stand was in line with his belief in built-up, not sprawling, urban centres.

He ran for the position of Mayor in the 1998 municipal election, placing fourth with 15 percent of the vote.

In 1997, he was the New Democratic Party candidate for the Montreal riding of Outremont.

=== Toronto mayoralty run ===
Gomberg then moved to Toronto, Ontario, where he ran for mayor in the 2000 municipal election. He received over 51,000 votes, but finished a distant second behind Mel Lastman who garnered over 80 per cent of the vote.

The campaign was nonetheless influential. Gomberg had been endorsed by urban guru Jane Jacobs, a longtime and influential resident of Toronto&#x27;s Annex neighbourhood. Some of Gomberg&#x27;s platform included advocacy of provincial powers for Toronto and tolls for downtown traffic, policies that re-emerged in the successful 2003 campaign of David Miller.

In the last days of the 2000 campaign, Lastman appeared with Canadian PM Jean Chrétien to promise nearly one billion dollars in social housing funding. After winning, one of Lastman&#x27;s first acts was to appoint Jane Jacobs to the city&#x27;s Charter Committee, which was seeking additional powers for the city (taking them from the province of Ontario). Both moves were generally attributed to the need to respond to Gomberg&#x27;s insurgent campaign.

== Media ==
While in Toronto, Gomberg also hosted &quot;Eco-Freako&quot;, a webcast TV show. It ran for ten episodes.

== Activism and arrests ==
Gomberg was often controversial as an environmental activist, being arrested numerous times.

In June 2000, he was arrested at the World Petroleum Congress protests in Calgary. A protest march took him by the Suncor building, which was a violation of terms from an arrest at a Suncor protest in Northern Alberta. He was held for a couple of hours, then released. His was one of only three arrests at the WPC protests - the others being a street youth with outstanding warrants, and a woman who, when leaving the convergence centre was followed by police for several kilometers, stopped, and arrested for traffic violations.

He locked himself in a safe in Alberta premier Ralph Klein&#x27;s constituency office as a protest against the province&#x27;s stance on Kyoto.

He was also arrested in the Netherlands after breaking into the Volkel NATO Air Force base with 9 other anti-nuclear activists working to expose the presence of nuclear weapons in that country.

==Death==
On Thursday, March 4, 2004, Gomberg was reported missing to police, who later stated that he appeared to have jumped off the middle of the Angus L. Macdonald Bridge, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in the early hours of the morning. He had left his partner a suicide note stating that he had &quot;lost his chutzpah&quot; and his bicycle and helmet were found on the bridge. His body was never found.

His partner, Angela Bischoff, suspects that his use of the antidepressant Remeron may have led to his decision to commit suicide. Gomberg had become increasingly agitated in his final weeks and his Remeron dosage had been increased to the maximum amount two days before his death. Three weeks later, U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued stronger warnings about a link between antidepressants and the risk of suicide, particularly in the weeks after a patient starts treatment or their dosage is increased. Health Canada later followed suit, and as of 2005, Remeron was listed in Health Canada&#x27;s adverse drug reaction database.

Toronto activists advocated the establishment of a major East-West Bike lane, to be called the &quot;Tooker&quot;, on Bloor Street, to honour the life of Tooker Gomberg.

Tooker Gomberg&#x27;s brother Ben is, as of summer 2009, the head of the Chicago Department of Transportation&#x27;s Bike (bicycle) Program.

<text>Driving under the influence (DUI) is the offense of driving, operating, or being in control of a vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs (including recreational drugs and those prescribed by physicians), to a level that renders the driver incapable of operating a motor vehicle safely. Multiple other terms are used for the offense in various jurisdictions.

==Terminology==

The name of the offense varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from legal to colloquial terminology. In various jurisdictions the offense is termed &quot;driving under the influence&quot; [of alcohol or other drugs] (DUI), &quot;driving under the influence of intoxicants&quot; (DUII), &quot;driving while impaired&quot; (DWI), &quot;impaired driving&quot;, &quot;driving while intoxicated&quot; (DWI), &quot;impaired driving&quot;, &quot;operating while intoxicated&quot; (OWI), &quot;operating under the influence&quot; (OUI), &quot;operating [a] vehicle under the influence&quot; (OVI), &quot;drunk in charge&quot;, or &quot;over the prescribed limit&quot; (OPL) (in the UK). Alcohol-related DUI is referred to as &quot;drunk driving&quot;, &quot;drunken driving&quot;, or &quot;drinking and driving&quot; (US), or &quot;drink-driving&quot; (UK/Ireland/Australia). Cannabis-related DUI may be termed &quot;driving high&quot;, and more generally drug-related DUI may be referred to as &quot;drugged driving&quot;, &quot;driving under the influence of drugs&quot; (DUID), or &quot;drug-impaired driving&quot;.

In the United States, the specific criminal offense is usually called driving under the influence, but states may use other names for the offense including &quot;driving while intoxicated&quot; (DWI), &quot;operating while impaired&quot; (OWI) or &quot;operating while ability impaired&quot;, and &quot;operating a vehicle under the influence&quot; (OVI).

==Definition==
In typical usage of the terms DUI, DWI, OWI, and OVI, the offense consists of driving a vehicle while affected by alcohol or drugs. However, 
in the majority of US states, the criminal offense may not involve actual driving of the vehicle but rather may broadly include &quot;operating&quot; or being physically &quot;in control&quot; of a motor vehicle while under the influence, even if the person charged is not in the act of driving. For example, individuals found in the driver&#x27;s seat of a car while intoxicated and holding the car keys, even while parked, may be charged with DUI because they are in control of the vehicle. In contrast, California only makes it illegal to &quot;drive&quot; a motor vehicle while under the influence, requiring actual &quot;driving&quot;. &quot;The distinction between these two terms is material, for it is generally held that the word &#x27;drive,&#x27; as used in statutes of this kind, usually denotes movement of the vehicle in some direction, whereas the word &#x27;operate&#x27; has a broader meaning so as to include not only the motion of the vehicle but also acts which engage the machinery of the vehicle that, alone or in sequence, will set in motion the motive power of the vehicle.&quot;

Many DUI laws also apply to motorcycling, boating, piloting aircraft, use of mobile farm machinery such as tractors and combine harvesters, riding horses or driving a horse-drawn vehicle, cycling, or skateboarding, possibly with different BAC level than regular driving. In some jurisdictions, there are separate charges depending on the vehicle used. In Washington state, for instance, BUI (bicycling under the influence) laws recognize that intoxicated cyclists are likely to primarily endanger themselves. Accordingly, law enforcement officers are empowered only to protect the cyclist by impounding the bicycle rather than filing DUI charges.

George Smith, a London Taxi cab driver, ended up being the first person to be convicted of driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated, on September 10, 1897, under the &quot;drunk in charge&quot; provision of the 1872 Licensing Act. He was fined 25 shillings, which is .

==Alcohol==

Drunk driving (or drink-driving in British English) is the act of driving under the influence of alcohol. A small increase in the blood alcohol content increases the relative risk of a motor vehicle crash. In the United States, alcohol is involved in 30% of all traffic fatalities. It is not known nationally how many people are killed each year in crashes involving drug-impaired drivers because of data limitations, but one study of drivers who were seriously injured in crashes found that 23.6% of drivers were positive for alcohol and 12.2% were positive solely for alcohol.

==Other drugs==
For drivers suspected of drug-impaired driving, drug testing screens are typically performed in scientific laboratories so that the results will be admissible in evidence at trial. Due to the overwhelming number of impairing substances that are not alcohol, drugs are classified into different categories for detection purposes. Drug impaired drivers still show impairment during the battery of standardized field sobriety tests, but there are additional tests to help detect drug impaired driving. In the US, one study found that 25.8% of drivers seriously injured in crashes tested positive for cannabinoids, 13.6% tested positive solely for cannabinoids, and 24.6% tested positive for a drug other than alcohol or cannabis.

===Recreational drugs===

Drivers who have smoked or otherwise consumed cannabis products such as marijuana or hashish can be charged and convicted of impaired driving in some jurisdictions. A 2011 study in the &quot;B.C. Medical Journal&quot; stated that there &quot;...is clear evidence that cannabis, like alcohol, impairs the psychomotor skills required for safe driving.&quot; The study stated that while &quot;[c]annabis-impaired drivers tend to drive more slowly and cautiously than drunk drivers... evidence shows they are also more likely to cause accidents than drug and alcohol-free drivers&quot;. A more recent 2023 study found that when compared to alcohol, &quot;the impairment effect of marijuana on driving is relatively mild&quot; since drivers using cannabis &quot;drive slower, avoid overtaking other vehicles, and increase following distances.&quot; In Canada, police forces such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have &quot;...specially trained drug recognition and evaluation [DRE] officers... [who] can detect whether or not a driver is drug impaired, by putting suspects through physical examinations and co-ordination tests. In 2014, in the Canadian province of Ontario, Bill 31, the Transportation Statute Law Amendment Act, was introduced to the provincial legislature. Bill 31 contains driver&#x27;s license &quot;...suspensions for those caught driving under the influence of drugs, or a combination of drugs and alcohol. Ontario police officers &quot;...use Standard Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) and drug recognition evaluations to determine whether the officer believes the driver is under the influence of drugs.&quot; In the province of Manitoba, an &quot;...officer can issue a physical coordination test. In B.C., the officer can further order a drug recognition evaluation by an expert, which can be used as evidence of drug use to pursue further charges.&quot;

In the US state of Colorado, the state government indicates that &quot;[a]ny amount of marijuana consumption puts you at risk of driving impaired.&quot; Colorado law states that &quot;drivers with five nanograms of active tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in their whole blood can be prosecuted for driving under the influence (DUI). However, no matter the level of THC, law enforcement officers base arrests on observed impairment.&quot; In Colorado, if consumption of marijuana is impairing your ability to drive, &quot;it is illegal for you to be driving, even if that substance is prescribed [by a doctor] or legally acquired.&quot;

===Prescription medications===
Prescription medications such as opioids and benzodiazepines often cause side effects such as excessive drowsiness, and, in the case of opioids, nausea. Other prescription drugs including antiepileptics and antidepressants are now also believed to have the same effect. In the last ten years, there has been an increase in motor vehicle crashes, and it is believed that the use of impairing prescription drugs has been a major factor. Workers are expected to notify their employer when prescribed such drugs to minimize the risk of motor vehicle crashes while at work.

If a worker who drives has a health condition which can be treated with opioids, then that person&#x27;s doctor should be told that driving is a part of the worker&#x27;s duties and the employer should be told that the worker could be treated with opioids. Workers should not use impairing substances while driving or operating heavy machinery like forklifts or cranes. If the worker is to drive, then the health care provider should not give them opioids. If the worker is to take opioids, then their employer should assign them work which is appropriate for their impaired state and not encourage them to use safety sensitive equipment.

==Testing==
===Field sobriety testing===

Field sobriety tests are a battery of tests used by police officers to determine if a person suspected of impaired driving is intoxicated with alcohol or other drugs. FSTs are primarily used in the United States, to meet &quot;probable cause for arrest&quot; requirements (or the equivalent), necessary to sustain a DWI or DUI conviction based on a chemical blood alcohol test. In the US, field sobriety tests are voluntary; however, some states mandate commercial drivers accept preliminary breath tests (PBT).

===Drug Evaluation and Classification program===

The Drug Evaluation and Classification program is designed to detect a drug impaired driver and classify the categories of drugs present in his or her system. The procedures are used post-arrest to gather evidence for trial, rather than for probable cause, as they would be difficult to conduct at the scene.

Initially developed by the Los Angeles, California, Police Department in the 1970s, the DEC program breaks down detection into a twelve-step process that a government-certified Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) can use to determine the category or categories of drugs that a suspect is impaired by. The twelve steps are:

#Breath Alcohol Test
#Interview with arresting officer (who notes slurred speech, alcohol on breath, etc.)
#Preliminary evaluation
#Evaluation of the eyes
#Psychomotor tests
#Vital signs
#Dark room examinations
#Muscle tone
#Injection sites (for injection of heroin or other drugs)
#Interrogation of suspect
#Opinion of the evaluator
#Toxicological examination

DREs are qualified to offer expert testimony in court that pertains to impaired driving on drugs.

The DEC program is recognized by all fifty states in the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom and DRE training in the use of the twelve-step [MS1] process is scientifically validated by both laboratory and field studies.

===Testing for cannabis===
U.S. states prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of drugs, including marijuana. For example, in Illinois it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle with a THC level of 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily substances. Under that law, an individual can be arrested for driving under influence of cannabis at any THC level, including under the per se legal limits if an Officer believes the individual is impaired by cannabis.

It can be important to perform testing soon after a traffic stop, as THC plasma levels decline significantly after the passage of one or two hours. A number of companies are developing roadside THC breathalyzers that may be used by the police to help identify drivers impaired by the use of marijuana. Some nations use saliva swabs to test for THC levels at roadside, but questions remain about the reliability of saliva testing.

==Other charges==
===Child endangerment===
In the US state of Colorado, impaired drivers may be charged with child endangerment if they are arrested for DUI with minor children in the vehicle.

===Wet reckless===
&quot;Wet reckless&quot; is a term used informally when a driver takes a plea bargain, agreeing to plead guilty to reckless driving in exchange for the elimination of the drunk driving charge. In California, a driver may not be charged or arrested for &quot;wet reckless&quot; driving, and the sole function of the charge is as a possible disposition following a plea bargain for a driver charged with DUI.

===Penalties===
In the case of a crash, car insurance may be automatically declared invalid for the intoxicated driver; the drunk driver would be fully responsible for damages. In the American system, a citation for driving under the influence also causes a major increase in car insurance premiums.

The German model serves to reduce the number of crashes by identifying unfit drivers and revoking their licenses until their fitness to drive has been established again. The medical-psychological assessment works for a prognosis of the fitness for drive in future, has an interdisciplinary basic approach, and offers the chance of individual rehabilitation to the offender.

==Laws by country==

The laws relating to DUI vary significantly between countries, particularly the thresholds at which a person is charged with a crime. In many countries, sobriety checkpoints (roadblocks of police cars where drivers are checked), driver&#x27;s licence suspensions, fines, and prison sentences for DUI offenders are used as part of an effort to deter impaired driving. In addition, many countries have prevention campaigns that use advertising to make people aware of the danger of driving while impaired and the potential fines and criminal charges, discourage impaired driving, and encourage drivers to take taxis or public transport home after using alcohol or other drugs. In some jurisdictions, a bar or restaurant that serves an impaired driver may face civil liability for injuries caused by that driver. In some countries, non-profit advocacy organizations, a well-known example being Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) run their own publicity campaigns against drunk or impaired driving.

=== US federal regulation===

The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) regulates many occupations and industries, and has a zero tolerance policy pertaining to the use of cannabis for any regulated employee whether he or she is on-duty or off-duty. Regardless of any State&#x27;s DUI Statutes and DMV Administrative Penalties, a Commercial Driver&#x27;s License &quot;CDL&quot; holder will have his or her CDL suspended for 1-year for a DUI arrest and will have his or her CDL revoked for life if they are subsequently arrested for driving impaired.

<doc id="511445" wikidata="Q219616" url="?curid=511445" title="Tightrope walking">
<text>Tightrope walking, also called funambulism, is the skill of walking along a thin wire or rope. It has a long tradition in various countries and is commonly associated with the circus. Other skills similar to tightrope walking include slack rope walking and slacklining.

==Types==

Tightwire is the skill of maintaining balance while walking along a tensioned wire between two points. It can be done either using a balancing tool (umbrella, fan, balance pole, etc.) or &quot;freehand&quot;, using only one&#x27;s body to maintain balance. Typically, tightwire performances either include dance or object manipulation. Object manipulation acts include a variety of props in their acts, such as clubs, rings, hats, or canes. Tightwire performers have even used wheelbarrows with passengers, ladders, and animals in their act. The technique to maintain balance is to keep the performer&#x27;s centre of mass above their support point—usually their feet.

Highwire is a form of tightwire walking but performed at much greater height. Although there is no official height when tightwire becomes highwire, generally a wire over high are regarded as a highwire act.

Skywalk is a form of highwire which is performed at great heights and length. A skywalk is performed outdoors between tall buildings, gorges, across waterfalls or other natural and man-made structures.

==Ropes==
If the &quot;lay&quot; of the rope (the orientation of the constituent strands, the &quot;twist&quot; of a rope) is in one direction, the rope can twist on itself as it stretches and relaxes. Underfoot, this could be hazardous to disastrous in a tightrope. One solution is for the rope core to be made of steel cable, laid in the opposite direction to the outer layers, so that twisting forces balance each other out.

==Biomechanics==
Acrobats maintain their balance by positioning their centre of mass directly over their base of support, i.e. shifting most of their weight over their legs, arms, or whatever part of their body they are using to hold them up. When they are on the ground with their feet side by side, the base of support is wide in the lateral direction but narrow in the sagittal (back-to-front) direction. In the case of highwire-walkers, their feet are parallel with each other, one foot positioned in front of the other while on the wire. Therefore, a tightwire walker&#x27;s sway is side to side, their lateral support having been drastically reduced. In both cases, whether side by side or parallel, the ankle is the pivot point.

A wire-walker may use a pole for balance or may stretch out their arms perpendicular to their trunk in the manner of a pole. This technique provides several advantages. It distributes mass away from the pivot point, thereby increasing the moment of inertia. This reduces angular acceleration, so a greater torque is required to rotate the performer over the wire. The result is less tipping. In addition, the performer can also correct sway by rotating the pole. This will create an equal and opposite torque on the body.

Tightwire-walkers typically perform in very thin and flexible, leather-soled slippers with a full-length suede or leather sole to protect the feet from abrasions and bruises, while still allowing the foot to curve around the wire. Though very infrequent in performance, amateur, hobbyist, or inexperienced funambulists will often walk barefoot so that the wire can be grasped between the big and second toe. This is more often done when using a rope, as the softer and silkier fibres are less taxing on the bare foot than the harder and more abrasive braided wire.

==Metaphorical use==
The word &quot;funambulism&quot;, the phrase &quot;walking a tightrope&quot;, and associated variants also occur in metaphorical contexts not referring to any actual acrobatic acts. For instance, politicians are said to &quot;walk a tightrope&quot; when trying to balance two opposing views with little room for compromise. The idea can also appear in satirical or acidic contexts. Nicholas Taleb uses the concept in his book &quot;The Black Swan&quot;: &quot;You get respect for doing funambulism or spectator sports [...].&quot;
Taleb is criticising scientists who prefer popularism to vigorous research and those who walk a fixed and narrow path rather than explore a large field of empirical study.

<doc id="511446" wikidata="Q1542874" url="?curid=511446" title="San Juan River (Colorado River tributary)">
<text>The San Juan River is a major tributary of the Colorado River in the Southwestern United States, providing the chief drainage for the Four Corners region of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona. Originating as snowmelt in the San Juan Mountains (part of the Rocky Mountains) of Colorado, it flows through the deserts of northern New Mexico and southeastern Utah to join the Colorado River at Glen Canyon.

The river drains a high, arid region of the Colorado Plateau. Along its length, it is often the only significant source of fresh water for many miles. The San Juan is also one of the muddiest rivers in North America, carrying an average of 25 million US tons (22.6 million t) of silt and sediment each year.

Historically, the San Juan formed the border between the territory of the Navajo in the south and the Ute in the north. Although Europeans explored the Four Corners region as early as the 1700s, it was not settled until the gold and silver booms of the 1860s, when settlers arrived in large numbers from the eastern United States. After heated conflicts over land, the Native Americans were forced into reservations, where their descendants live today.

During the 20th century, intensive drilling in the fossil-fuel rich San Juan Basin and uranium mining along the lower river in Utah generated serious concerns about water quality, particularly in the Navajo Nation where the river is a crucial source of water for irrigation. Runoff from abandoned gold and silver mines has also been a major issue, as occurred in the 2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill into the Animas River, the main tributary of the San Juan.

The U.S. federal government has built a number of large dams in the San Juan River system to control floods and to provide irrigation and domestic water supply. In addition, the lower part of the river is inundated by Lake Powell, one of the largest reservoirs in the United States. Efficient management is crucial to ensuring enough water supply not just for farms and urban areas but also for recreational boating, fisheries, and environmental restoration. However, heavy water use has significantly reduced the flow of the San Juan River by as much as 25 percent since pre-development conditions. In addition, warming temperatures in the Rocky Mountains are projected to have a further negative effect on snowpack and thus stream flow.

==Course==


The San Juan River begins in Archuleta County, Colorado at the confluence of its East and West Forks. Both forks originate above elevations of in the eastern San Juan Mountains in the San Juan National Forest. The river flows southwest through the foothills of the Rocky Mountains through the town of Pagosa Springs and reaches the Navajo Lake reservoir just north of the New Mexico border, near Arboles, Colorado. Below the Navajo Dam, the San Juan River flows west through a narrow farming valley in the high desert country of the Colorado Plateau. At Farmington, New Mexico, it is joined from the north by its main tributary, the Animas River, which rises in the San Juan Mountains near Silverton, Colorado.

From there it flows west through the Navajo Nation, turning northwest near Shiprock and its namesake monolith, crossing very briefly back into southwest Colorado (within half a mile (0.8 km) of the Four Corners quadripoint) before entering southeastern Utah. West of Bluff, Utah the river slices through the Comb Ridge and enters a series of rugged winding canyons, often over in depth. The lower of the San Juan River, in a remote portion of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, are flooded by Lake Powell, which is formed by Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River. The San Juan joins the Colorado in San Juan County, Utah at a point about to the north of Navajo Mountain and northeast of Page, Arizona.

Tributaries of the upper San Juan River above Navajo Dam include the Rio Blanco and the Navajo River, and the Piedra River and Los Pinos River (Pine River) which join the San Juan in Navajo Lake. In addition to the Animas River, several major tributaries join below Farmington, including the La Plata River and Mancos River in New Mexico, and McElmo Creek in Utah. San Juan also has a number of seasonal tributaries that drain arid regions of the Colorado Plateau. These include the Cañon Largo and Chaco River in New Mexico and the Montezuma Creek and Chinle Creek in Utah. The northern tributaries of the San Juan River, which originate in the San Juan Mountains, are snowmelt-driven, with the highest flows between March and June. Southern tributaries such as the Chaco River are mostly ephemeral but can carry large volumes of water during flash floods.

===Discharge===
According to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the average unimpaired runoff or natural flow of the San Juan River basin over the 1906–2014 period was about , per year. The maximum was , , in 1941, and the minimum was , , in 2002. Heavy water use has decreased the river flow considerably since the early 20th century. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gaging station at Bluff, Utah, recorded an average annual discharge of , or , for the 1915–2013 period. Before the construction of major dams to regulate the river, it sometimes dried up completely in the summer, as it did in 1934 and 1939. The maximum flow was on September 10, 1927. The great flood of October 1911, which remains the largest recorded flood on the San Juan River, occurred before the USGS began measuring streamflow here. Based on observations of water depth and debris deposits, the 1911 flood may have reached a peak of .
The San Juan River annual hydrograph exhibits large seasonal variations with the highest monthly flow of in June, and the lowest of in December. The completion of Navajo Dam in 1963 and its associated water supply projects have decreased the flow of the river, from about in the 1914–1963 period to less than for the 1964–2016 period, although a minimum release from the dam prevents the river from drying up in the summer. Persistent drought conditions in the 21st century have further reduced the flow of the San Juan River, with an average annual discharge of or between water years 2000 and 2016.

==Geology==
The oldest geologic feature of the San Juan River basin is the San Juan Mountains, which consist largely of Precambrian and Paleozoic crystalline rock and outcrops of Tertiary volcanic rock. During the Paleocene and Eocene (about 66–34 million years ago), streams draining off the southern flank of the San Juan Mountains terminated in the San Juan Basin around present-day Farmington, slowly filling it with thick layers of sediment. Over millions of years, the burial of organic material under sedimentary layers created the abundant coal, oil, and natural gas deposits found in the area today.

Fluvial deposits indicate that a stream flowed west across the Colorado Plateau to join the Colorado River at least by the late Miocene (about 5 million years ago). This may have been the ancestral Dolores River, before the uplift of the Ute Mountains diverted it to its present northerly course. When the San Juan Basin filled and overflowed, it formed an outflow channel west into the old Dolores River bed, establishing the San Juan River&#x27;s modern course.
Though Tectonic forces about 2–3 million years ago caused the terrain to rise across the Monument Upwarp in southeast Utah and northeast Arizona, the river maintained its course as an antecedent stream. The Monument Upwarp consists of a series of parallel anticlines and synclines running generally north to south in an area roughly long and wide. Where the river passes through these formations, it has sliced deep canyons through the reddish rock. In places, the San Juan has entrenched its ancient meanders thousands of feet into the bedrock, as can be observed in Goosenecks State Park, where it winds through a set of horseshoe bends while traveling a straight-line distance of only . The canyon cutting was accelerated during the Pleistocene Ice Ages when the climate of the area was much wetter. The wetter climate resulted in floods of up to –ten times larger than any flooding of the San Juan in recorded human history.

The San Juan River flows through highly erodible sedimentary rock–such as sandstone, siltstone, and shale–that make up rock formations such as the slide-prone Chinle Formation. As a result, the San Juan is an extremely muddy river, contributing more than half of the sediment that occurs in the upper Colorado River above Lees Ferry despite accounting for only 14 percent of the total runoff.

Between 1914 and 1980, the U.S. Geological Survey station at Bluff, Utah, recorded an average of 25.41 million tons of sediment carried by the San Juan River each year—ranging from 3.24 million tons in 1978 to 112.4 million tons in 1941. The majority of the sediment originates in the watershed downstream of the Animas River.

Since the closure of the Glen Canyon Dam in 1963, sediments have been building a delta in Lake Powell instead of continuing down the Colorado River. Core samples taken in 2011 indicate aggradations up to thick in the San Juan River arm of Lake Powell.

==Watershed==
===Geography===

The San Juan River drains approximately in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona; the watershed land area is almost the same size as the state of West Virginia. The main stem of the river does not flow through Arizona but comes very close at the Four Corners. The highest point in the San Juan River watershed is Windom Peak, located near the headwaters of the Animas River. The lowest elevation, where the San Juan River flows into Lake Powell, has a normal maximum elevation of but typically fluctuates dozens of feet per year due to seasonal nature of runoff in the Colorado River Basin affecting the reservoir level. Most of the watershed is rural, with some extremely remote, uninhabited areas. About 75 percent of the watershed is shrubland, rangeland, and grassland. Due to the low rainfall and lack of substantial groundwater reserves, agricultural use is scarce, except for river valleys and in higher foothill areas influenced by wetter montane climates. About 2.3 percent of the watershed is dryland farms, and 1.6 percent is irrigated. Forests cover about 20 percent of the watershed, mostly at high elevations.

The San Juan Mountains and Ute Mountains bound the watershed on the north, the Jemez Mountains lie to the east, and various upland and mesa areas of the Colorado Plateau to the south and west. The San Juan Basin is a distinct area of the San Juan River watershed; it is a geologic structural basin known for its abundant fuel resources. The San Juan Basin is roughly coterminous with the southeast quadrant of the San Juan River watershed in northwest New Mexico and southwest Colorado. The watershed as a whole is very arid, with average annual precipitation just shy of . However, precipitation can be as high as in the mountains at the headwaters of the San Juan River; a considerable portion of this falls as winter snow. In desert areas, most of the annual precipitation is generated by intense rainstorms during the peak monsoon season of July and August.

Although about 90 percent of the river&#x27;s water originates as snowmelt in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, the largest portion of the watershed – , or 40 percent – lies in New Mexico. A further 23 percent of the watershed is in Colorado, 20 percent is in Arizona, and 17 percent is in Utah. In terms of area drained, the Chaco River is the largest tributary draining , followed by Chinle Creek which drains . The Animas River is the largest tributary in terms of stream flow, but drains a comparatively slim watershed of . In the 21st century, the snowpack in the San Juan Mountains has often been diminished by warming winter temperatures which has led to concerns about the long-term water supply for the San Juan River. In addition, the mountains are particularly vulnerable to dust storms originating from the Great Basin; dust settling on snowpack increases the absorption of solar energy and often leads to premature melting.

===Administration and land use===
Well over 50 percent of the San Juan River watershed are Native American lands, the largest being the Navajo Nation, which covers portions of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, in addition to the Jicarilla Apache Nation in New Mexico and the Ute Mountain and Southern Ute Indian Reservations in southwest Colorado. Federal agencies, principally the Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service and National Park Service, administer about 25 percent of the watershed. About 13 percent are privately owned (non-Indian) lands, and 3 percent belong to state and local governments.

Protected areas in the watershed include Colorado&#x27;s Mesa Verde National Park and Canyons of the Ancients National Monument; the Chaco Culture National Historical Park in New Mexico, Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Arizona and Bears Ears National Monument in Utah. These parks are all known for their archaeological sites and ancient Native American dwellings. The San Juan National Forest encompasses more than 1.8 million acres (7300 km2) of alpine peaks, pine forests, and desert mesas in the San Juan Mountains; the San Juan watershed includes parts of the South San Juan and Weminuche Wildernesses, the latter being the largest federally designated wilderness in Colorado. Other notable features in the watershed include Shiprock, a nearly high monadnock formation sacred to the Navajo people, and Monument Valley, whose rugged scenery has appeared in many Western films and other media.

The watershed is lightly populated, with most settlements concentrated along the San Juan and Animas Rivers. Farmington, New Mexico is the largest city, with a population of 45,965 at the 2010 census. Other major cities include Durango, Colorado (16,897), Cortez, Colorado (8,482), Shiprock, New Mexico (8,295) and Aztec, New Mexico (6,757). The San Juan Basin supports a large resource extraction economy, with oil, natural gas, coal, helium, alum, clay, fluorspar, uranium and various gemstones as the primary products; historically gold, silver, copper, and lead were also produced in large quantities. As of 2009, the over 40,000 wells in the San Juan Basin had produced more than 42 trillion cubic feet (1.2 trillion m3) of natural gas and 281 million barrels of oil.

==History==
===Indigenous peoples===
The San Juan River and its tributaries were an important water source for Native Americans as early as 10,000 BC, when Paleo-Indians inhabited the Four Corners region. By 500 BC–450 AD, the Basketmaker culture was succeeded by the Ancestral Puebloans or Anasazi, who developed distinctive irrigation methods and masonry architecture (&quot;pueblos&quot;); many ruins and sites are preserved in the San Juan watershed in places such as Mesa Verde National Park. Most settlements were concentrated along the upper San Juan River in New Mexico, where the terrain is gentler and water more abundant. The lower San Juan River in Utah flows through inaccessible canyons that largely precluded habitation. Starting around 1300 AD, a warming climate brought long droughts to the area, forcing the Puebloans to abandon their settlements north of the San Juan River and perhaps eventually causing them to migrate out of the San Juan River basin to the Rio Grande Valley, where their descendants live today.

The Navajo, who continue to live along the San Juan River today, are believed to have migrated into the Four Corners region by the 1500s, and may have come into contact with the last departing Anasazi. The Navajo name for the river was , &quot;Old Age River&quot; or &quot;Old Man&#x27;s River&quot;. Due to its westerly flow, the San Juan is considered a &quot;male river&quot; () and its sacred confluence with the south-flowing Colorado River (the &quot;female river&quot;), in Glen Canyon near Rainbow Bridge, &quot;is the place where clouds and moisture are physically created.&quot; The Navajo made offerings to the river to &quot;bless the land with water and provide protection from non-Navajo enemies&quot;. The Weminuche Ute, whose homeland was primarily in what is now Colorado, used the San Juan River as their southern boundary with the Navajo. The two groups considered each other enemies.

===Spanish colonization and American settlement===
The first use of the name &quot;Rio San Juan&quot; (after San Juan Bautista, the Spanish name for Saint John the Baptist) was apparently by Spanish explorer Juan Rivera, who led an expedition to the area in 1765. Rivera&#x27;s route would later become part of the Old Spanish Trail between Santa Fe, New Mexico and Southern California. About a decade later, in 1776, the Domínguez–Escalante expedition passed through the San Juan River country, attempting to find a route from Santa Fe to the presidio in Monterey, California. Domínguez and Escalante crossed the San Juan River near where Navajo Lake is today and described the area as having good land suitable for settlement and farming but also &quot;excessively cold even in the months of July and August.&quot; The expedition was unsuccessful, turning back at Utah Valley, but their discoveries were crucial in opening up the region to future European settlement.
Neither Spain nor Mexico established permanent settlements in the San Juan River country due to the harsh winter weather and presence of the native population. In 1848, after the Mexican–American War the area became part of the United States; prospectors arrived in the late 1850s, and upon their discovery of placer gold in tributaries of the upper San Juan River, a gold rush began to the San Juan Mountains. The gold rush reached its peak after the creation of Colorado Territory in 1861, bringing thousands of fortune seekers to this remote region. Silver was discovered along the Animas River in 1871 and led to the growth of present-day Silverton below the area&#x27;s labor-intensive hard rock mines. The narrow-gauge San Juan Extension of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&amp;RGW) was completed in 1881, linking Durango with the rest of the D&amp;RGW system at Alamosa, Colorado via tracks through the upper San Juan River canyon.

The rapidly rising number of settlers faced conflicts with Ute and Navajo Indians. In 1863, the U.S. Army under General James Henry Carleton, in response to the &quot;Navajo problem&quot;, forcibly evicted almost 10,000 Navajo from their lands near the San Juan River. More than 2,000 people died of starvation and disease during and after the &quot;Long Walk&quot; to Fort Sumner, New Mexico. However, the Navajo were allowed to return to much of their original lands in 1868, and a federally recognized reservation was established south of the San Juan River. The Utes, who had been granted a reservation in western Colorado in 1868, faced hostility with settlers because most of the area&#x27;s mineral wealth was concentrated on Ute lands. The U.S. Army drove the last of the Utes from southwest Colorado by 1881 (with the exception of a small portion in the Southern Ute Reservation, established by the Brunot Agreement in 1873) and the following year of land were opened up for ranching, farming, and prospecting.

An unintended consequence of the Indian wars was how they shaped future water rights in the San Juan River system. When the Navajo reservation was established in 1868, it implicitly included water rights, which were formally acknowledged when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Winters v. United States&quot; (1908) that a federally established Indian reservation was &quot;entitled to the water needed to create a permanent homeland.&quot; In 2005 the state of New Mexico reached a settlement with the Navajo Nation, where the Navajo finally secured their claim to over of San Juan River water. Due to the prior appropriation doctrine, the Navajo now possess the best water rights to the San Juan River. In &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot;, Marc Reisner writes: &quot;The Indians, where water was concerned, clearly had the upper hand. The white man&#x27;s cavalry had made beggars of them; now his courts had made them kings.&quot;

The lower San Juan River country remained a remote backwater well into the late 19th century; John Wesley Powell&#x27;s famed 1869 expedition down the Colorado River barely noted the San Juan River where they passed it in Glen Canyon. During the 1875 Hayden Survey of the lower San Juan River, George B. Chittenden wrote: &quot;This whole portion of the country is now and must ever remain utterly worthless. It has no timber, very little grass, and no water.&quot; However, in 1879 more than 200 Mormon pioneers embarked on the Hole-in-the-Rock expedition which established the agricultural settlement of Bluff, Utah on the lower San Juan River in April 1880. The wagon trail they established became an important link between Utah Territory and the Four Corners region (although the infamously difficult Hole-in-the-Rock crossing just above the mouth of the San Juan was moved upstream to Halls Crossing the following year). The colony suffered greatly in its early years due to a series of floods, but the settlers persisted, as the LDS church strongly wished to maintain its presence in southeast Utah. In 1882, oil prospector E. L. Goodridge conducted the first known exploration of the lower San Juan canyons, floating from Bluff to Lee&#x27;s Ferry, Arizona. Later, placer gold was discovered along the river, which brought more than 2,000 miners to Bluff in the 1890s in what proved to be a short-lived boom.

===20th century===
In October 1911, heavy monsoon rains generated the largest flood ever recorded on the San Juan River, causing severe damage along the entire length of the river and many of its tributaries. More than 100 bridges and of railroad tracks were destroyed in the Colorado part of the river basin alone, completely cutting off transport and communications. Along the Animas River, &quot;virtually all the crops&quot; were destroyed. On the lower river, most of Bluff was inundated and of farmland was swept away. At Mexican Hat, Utah the Goodridge bridge, whose deck was above the river, was destroyed, indicating the floodwaters were at least that deep.
Farmington, the largest city on the San Juan River and in the Four Corners region, was established in 1901 and grew significantly in the 1920s as coal, oil, and natural gas were discovered in the area. Uranium was discovered in the Bluff area in the 1940s, and became a major source for the US nuclear program during World War II and afterward for domestic nuclear plants. As a consequence of the uranium boom, over 500 mining waste disposal sites continue to contaminate the San Juan River and local groundwater. One of the most polluted sites (at the former Shiprock, New Mexico mill) exhibits considerable leakage into the river. Oil spills have also contaminated the San Juan River at times; one of the largest occurred in October 1972 when over 4.5 million gallons (1 million liters) of oil leaked into the San Juan River from a broken pipeline.

The gold and silver industry began to decline in the 1950s, leaving behind hundreds of abandoned mines that have contributed to acid mine drainage problems. Rail traffic along the San Juan River declined with the closure of mines, although it was revived briefly in the 1960s by a temporary rise in oil production. When Navajo Dam was built along the upper San Juan River, it flooded the towns of Rosa and Arboles as well as a large portion of the D&amp;RGW San Juan Line through the river canyon. The federal government paid for the cost of relocating the line, which began operating in August 1962; however, this section along the San Juan River was abandoned barely five years later due to falling traffic. (The section of the San Juan Line east of Chama has been preserved as the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad, and the section from Durango to Silverton as the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad.)

In 2015, one of the worst environmental disasters in Colorado and New Mexico&#x27;s history occurred when the Gold King Mine near Silverton experienced a massive wastewater spill. The accident occurred when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was attempting to drain contaminated water that had built up at the mine entrance. More than 3 million gallons (11,400 m3) of highly acidic waste spilled into the Animas and San Juan Rivers, turning the water a bright yellow-orange color. The spill temporarily threatened irrigation and domestic water supply as far downstream as the Navajo Nation and contaminated sediment with heavy metals, including lead and zinc. The EPA asserted it would take &quot;full responsibility&quot; for the spill.

==Dams and water projects==

As early as 2,000 years ago, the Anasazi were known to build dams and sophisticated irrigation systems on tributaries of the San Juan River to irrigate their crops. During the initial period of European settlement in the 1800s, small private dams were built to supply water to farms and mining operations and to generate hydroelectricity (an early hydro project was the Tacoma power station, built on the Animas River in 1905.) In 1901, the Turley survey concluded that the San Juan River contained enough water to irrigate up to , but due to the high cost of delivering water to desert lands, neither private investors nor the federal government were willing to fund such large projects. The U.S. Reclamation Service (now the Bureau of Reclamation) conducted surveys of dam sites on the lower San Juan River in 1914, as part of the Boulder Canyon Project (the so-called &quot;Bluff reservoir&quot; was never built, after engineers determined that the high silt load of the lower San Juan would make a storage reservoir here useless within a short time). By the 1920s – with the oil boom spurring rapid growth in the Farmington area and food shortages impacting the Navajo Nation – the federal government recognized the need for a multi-purpose dam project on the upper San Juan River, which would later become Navajo Dam.

The big water projects in the San Juan River basin were mostly built by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation after the 1950s as participating units of the Colorado River Storage Project, whose aim was to regulate the water supply of the upper Colorado River system, control floods and generate power. Navajo Dam, completed in 1963 after five years of construction, impounds 1.7 million acre feet (2.1 km3) of water in Navajo Lake. The dam serves for flood control, irrigation and long-term water storage, and its operations are paired with two major water projects of the upper San Juan River: the San Juan–Chama Project which diverts almost per year from the San Juan watershed to the Rio Grande system serving Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project which provides water for of farmland on the Navajo Nation. These two projects together were designed to put to &quot;beneficial use&quot; the water allocated to New Mexico under the 1922 Colorado River Compact, which divided the waters of the Colorado River and its tributaries between the seven U.S. states that make up the Colorado River Basin.

Today, a total of of land are irrigated in the San Juan watershed, supplied by a combination of federal and local agencies. Other federal reclamation projects in the San Juan watershed are the Pine River Project, consisting of Vallecito Dam and Lake on the Los Pinos River; the Florida Project with Lemon Dam and Reservoir on the Florida River; and the Hammond Project along the San Juan River below Navajo Dam. The Dolores Project diverts water from the Dolores River to serve farmers in the San Juan watershed, near Cortez, Colorado. The most recently completed project is the Animas-La Plata Water Project near Durango, which had been authorized as early as 1968, but was not completed until 2013. Originally intended as an irrigation project, it was redesigned to provide domestic and industrial water supply. Currently under construction is the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project, which intends to convey water south from Navajo Lake to parts of the Navajo Nation and Jicarilla Apache Nation as far as Gallup, New Mexico.

==River ecology==
The San Juan River provides habitat for at least eight native fish species – cutthroat trout, roundtail chub, speckled dace, flannelmouth sucker, bluehead sucker, mottled sculpin, Colorado pikeminnow, and razorback sucker, with a possible ninth, bonytail chub. The latter three are considered endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and are rarely found in the San Juan River today, if at all. With the exception of trout and dace, which inhabit clear, cold mountain streams in the headwaters, the native fishes are mostly adapted to the warm, shallow and silty characteristics of the lower San Juan. The San Juan cutthroat trout, a unique lineage of cutthroat trout endemic to the river and its tributaries, was considered extinct until its rediscovery in 2018. In addition, about 23 non-native fish species have been introduced to the San Juan River watershed. The common carp and channel catfish have become widespread in the lower reaches of the San Juan River. In the &quot;tailwater&quot; reach below Navajo Dam, introduced rainbow and brown trout thrive in the cold and stable flows released from the dam. Rainbow and brown trout have also proliferated in the headwaters of the San Juan River above Navajo Lake.

Native fish species in the San Juan River reproduce during high spring runoff events, which historically would overflow the banks of the river and spread out into the riparian zone, creating off-channel spawning habitat. Since the completion of the Navajo Dam, the portion of the San Juan River between the dam and Farmington became unsuitable for native fish due to the reduction in seasonal fluctuations. However, at Farmington the San Juan is joined by the Animas River – which is not controlled by any major dams – and regains some of its seasonal characteristics. In addition, the impoundment of water at Navajo Dam does not appear to have a significant effect on the amount of sediment transported in the river; thus, the aquatic environment of the lower San Juan, though somewhat degraded, still resembles pre-development conditions.

The Bureau of Reclamation consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service between 1991 and 1997 to develop operation criteria at Navajo Dam that would comply with the Endangered Species Act. Since 1999, Navajo Dam releases have been changed to approximate the historic seasonal hydrograph of the San Juan River rather than a stable flow year-round. The San Juan River Basin Recovery Implementation Program requires spring peak releases of , dependent on water availability, and a reduction of the summer base flow from to , to mimic historic dry season conditions. The peak release from Navajo Dam is timed to match the peak of snowmelt runoff on the Animas River. The program also includes other restoration and remediation work, such as improving fish passage at diversion dams, removing obsolete diversion structures, and eradicating non-native species such as catfish.

==Recreation==

The San Juan is a popular recreational river, despite some parts of its course being remote. Near the headwaters, Pagosa Springs, Colorado is known for its natural hot springs on the banks of the San Juan River. In the foothills, the Navajo Lake is one of the largest bodies of water in both Colorado and New Mexico. Navajo State Park in Colorado and Navajo Lake State Park in New Mexico provide boating, water-skiing, fishing, and shoreline camping; two marinas are located in the New Mexico portion of the lake. The of river from below Navajo Dam to Gobernador Wash are known as one of the best trout fishing waters in the United States due to the cold, clear flows released from the base of the dam. Cutthroat, rainbow and brown trout are present in this section of the San Juan River. Although trout are present in another further downstream to Cañon Largo, the fishery is diminished in quality due to rising amounts of sediment. These &quot;Quality Waters&quot; of the San Juan River are visited by well over 50,000 anglers each year.

The section of the river between Farmington and Bluff which flows through Navajo lands is administered by the Navajo Nation Parks and Recreation Department, which issues permits for hiking and camping. However, it is seldom visited by boaters due to a lack of good river access sites. The lower San Juan River below Bluff is used heavily for whitewater boating and rafting, especially below the Sand Island river access, which (as of 2006) sees about 11,165 users per year. Many boaters take out at Mexican Hat, about down the river, although some continue through the lower canyons to Clay Hills, near the head of Lake Powell, further downstream. Commercial trips operate mainly during the late spring-early summer snowmelt season, though the season can be extended significantly in wet years. Applications for private trips are approved by the Bureau of Land Management&#x27;s Monticello Field Office via lottery; about 900 spots are awarded each year out of more than 4000 requests. The section between Mexican Hat and Clay Hills is characterized by moderate class II-III rapids. Below Clay Hills, the San Juan flows through very isolated country to Lake Powell, where a long flat-water paddle is required to reach the closest services at Dangling Rope Marina.

It is one of the two Grands Prix (along with the British) which has run as an event of the Formula One World Championship Grands Prix every season, continuously since the championship was introduced in 1950. Every Formula One Italian Grand Prix in the World Championship era has been held at Monza except in 1980, when it was held at Imola.

The Italian Grand Prix counted toward the World Manufacturers&#x27; Championship from 1925 to 1928 and toward the European Championship from 1931 to 1932 and from 1935 to 1938. It was additionally designated the European Grand Prix seven times between 1923 and 1967, when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe. Four editions before the World Championship were held in places other than Monza: Montichiari (1921), Livorno (1937), Milan (1947) and Turin (1948).

The event is due to take place at the Monza Circuit until at least 2031.

==History==

===Origins===
The first Italian Grand Prix took place on 4 September 1921 at a 10.7-mile (17.3 km) circuit near Montichiari. However, the race is more closely associated with the course at Monza, a racing facility just outside the northern city of Milan, Italy&#x27;s second largest city in its largest metropolitan area, its economic capital and Alfa Romeo&#x27;s home. The circuit is specifically located in its namesake suburban town, which was built in 1922 in time for that year&#x27;s race, and has been the location for most of the races over the years. Monza was built in the &quot;Parco di Monza&quot;, a public city park with a largely woodland setting, where the famous Royal Villa of Monza is also located.

====Autodromo Nazionale di Monza====

The was completed in 1922 and was just the third permanent autodrome in the world at that time; Brooklands in England and Indianapolis in the United States were the two others. European motor racing pioneers Vincenzo Lancia and Felice Nazzaro laid the last two bricks at Monza. The circuit was 10 km (6.25 miles) long, with a flat banked section and a road circuit combined into one. It was fast, and always provided excitement. The 1923 race included one of Harry A. Miller&#x27;s rare European appearances with his single seat &quot;American Miller 122&quot; driven by Count Louis Zborowski of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang fame. Zborowski was killed at the following year&#x27;s Grand Prix at Monza driving a Mercedes.
The 1928 race was the first of many tragedies that befell this venue. Italians Emilio Materassi in a Talbot and Giulio Foresti in a Bugatti were battling around the fast circuit. As they came off the banking onto the left side of the pit straight at 125 mph (200 km/h), one of the front wheels of Materassi&#x27;s overtaking Talbot touched one of the rear wheels of the Bugatti. Materassi lost control of the car, swerved left, cleared a 15-foot wide and 10-foot deep ditch and ploughed into the unprotected grandstand opposite the pits, killing himself and 27 spectators, and injuring another 26. It was the worst accident in motor racing history and remained so until the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Italian Grand Prix went on a three-year hiatus (but the alternative non-championship Monza Grand Prix was run in 1929 and 1930) until the 1931 race, held in late May instead of the traditional early September, was won by Giuseppe Campari and Tazio Nuvolari, sharing an Alfa Romeo. The 1931 race was something of an endurance race; it took ten hours to complete. The great Nuvolari won again in a shortened 1932 race, this time held in early June.

===The black day of 1933===
In 1933, with the race being held this time at the traditional timeframe of early September, disaster struck again. Three top drivers were killed during the course of the Monza Grand Prix, a &quot;Formula Libre&quot; race held over three heats and a final in the afternoon of 10 September, after the Italian Grand Prix itself had been held in the morning, on what became known as the &quot;Black Day of Monza&quot;. During the second heat, there was a reported patch of oil on the south banking that had come from a Duesenberg, driven by Count Carlo Felice Trossi, and Giuseppe Campari in a Ferrari-entered Alfa Romeo and his protege Baconin Borzacchini in a Maserati were already battling ferociously; and Borzacchini and Campari went through the south banking on the first lap, wheel to wheel. Borzacchini went through the oily patch, lost control, spun wildly and the Maserati then overturned and violently flipped multiple times, and by the time the wrecked car came to a stop, Borzacchini was pinned underneath and was being crushed by his car, not having been thrown out. And while Borzacchini&#x27;s Maserati had been crashing all over the track, Campari swerved to avoid him, and by doing this, his car went up and flew off the banking and crashed into trees situated right next to the track. Campari broke his neck and was killed instantly, and Borzacchini died later that day in a Monza hospital.

Prior to the final, there was a drivers meeting to discuss the oil patch, and it was decided to clean it up. On the eighth lap, Polish aristocrat Count Stanislas Czaykowski was on the south banking when his Bugatti&#x27;s engine blew up, and a fuel line then broke. The fuel from the Bugatti&#x27;s tank caught fire after touching the very hot front section of the Bugatti where the engine and gearbox were and the burning fuel sprayed onto Czaykowski. Blinded by the smoke and flames on him, he went up and flew off the banking- at the same spot where Campari and Borzacchini had crashed. The Polish driver, unable to put out the flames on his body which was fuelled by the fuel from his wrecked Bugatti, then burned to death. Frenchman Marcel Lehoux in a Bugatti was declared the winner of the shortened event.

Enzo Ferrari, who had been close to Campari and Borzacchini; the former deciding to defect from Ferrari&#x27;s team to Maserati, became hardened by this tragedy. Today, racing historians conclude that the events of this race marked a watershed, notably for Enzo Ferrari. It was the end to the joyful era of racing and the beginning of a harsher new age. Safety in those days was completely non-existent. The circuit&#x27;s condition was virtually identical of that to an ordinary town and country road, except instead of the surface being made of dirt and/or tarmac, it was made of tarmac, concrete and/or bricks. Spectators often stood very close to or even next to the track and they had no protection of any kind other than common sense. What was particularly tragic about the 41-year old Campari&#x27;s death was that he had announced his retirement at the French Grand Prix two months earlier, to focus on his opera singing exploits.

===The Florio circuit and other locations===
After the disastrous 1933 race, something had to be done to Monza. In 1934 a short version of Florio Circuit (introduced in 1930 for Monza Grand Prix) was used: the drivers had to start from the main straight but taking the south curve of the high speed ring (interrupted by a double chicane) in the opposite direction compared to the usual one; then, through the connection introduced a few years before by Florio, they took the central straight, the south curve (also interrupted by a chicane) and the main straight; finally a 180 ° hairpin turned back to the finish line. This configuration was considered too slow and since the following year Florio circuit (with five chicanes) was used. These races were at a time when Mercedes and Auto Union became involved in motor racing; the German Silver Arrows won all of these races; with superstar Rudolf Caracciola winning in 1934 and in 1937 when the Italian Grand Prix was held at a street circuit in Livorno. 1938 saw a return to Monza, which was won by Nuvolari driving a mid-engined Auto Union; just after the race renovation works began but in 1939 World War II broke out and the Italian Grand Prix did not return until 1947.

1947 saw the Italian Grand Prix being held at a fairgrounds park in the city of Milan&#x27;s district of Portello, and this race was won by Italian Carlo Felice Trossi driving an Alfa Romeo. Italian Giovanni Bracco went off the road in his Delage and crashed into a group of spectators, killing five. This venue was never used again for racing, and 1948 saw it being held in Valentino Park, a public park in Turin. The 1949 race returned to Monza where it stayed for the next 30 years with the configuration ready before the war but never used yet.

=== Monza&#x27;s redevelopments (1949–1979) ===
Monza&#x27;s banking had been built over and only the road circuit was used, which had been modified slightly. The new long, fluid final corner was now two around 90-degree corners. 1949 saw Italian new-boy Alberto Ascari, son of the late 1924 Italian Grand Prix winner Antonio Ascari, win in his Ferrari; Enzo Ferrari was now building his own cars instead of running Alfa Romeos. 1950 saw the new Formula One Championship being established. The race and the first championship was won by Giuseppe &quot;Nino&quot; Farina, driving a supercharged Alfa Romeo 158. 1951 saw Ascari win again, after the competitive Alfas of Farina and Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio ran into engine problems. 1952 saw Ascari complete his domination of that season. 1953 Fangio won in a Maserati; although Ascari had already won the championship at the Swiss Grand Prix. 1954 turned out to be an interesting race; as up-and-comer Stirling Moss in a Maserati passed both Fangio&#x27;s Mercedes and Ascari&#x27;s Ferrari. The furious pace saw the retirement of Moss and Ascari and Fangio went on to win while Moss pushed his Maserati 250F over the line. 
After the 1954 running, work began on entirely revamping the circuit. New facilities were built and a new corner, the Parabolica, was built right before the pits. Extra track used for a short course was eliminated. The biggest change was the construction of the new Monza banking. Built on top of where the almost flat, narrow original banking was, these huge concrete bankings, called the &quot;sopraelevata&quot; curves, were built in the same shape as the original banking had been. The only significant difference was that the &quot;Curva Sud&quot; was moved slightly to the north. This course was combined with the road course for the 1955 event, which was won by Fangio and was the last race contested by a full-fledged Mercedes factory effort in Formula One until 2010. The 10 km Monza circuit was now so fast that F1 cars were averaging 135+ mph per lap- though rather unremarkable by today&#x27;s standards, these average speeds were even faster than the Indianapolis Speedway oval in the United States. 1956 saw an exciting race, with championship contenders Fangio, Briton Peter Collins (both in Ferraris) and Frenchman Jean Behra in a Maserati fight over the win. Stirling Moss was already out of championship contention; and Fangio retired with a broken steering arm. The Ferrari team called for Italian Luigi Musso to hand his car over to Fangio. Musso ignored the order so Collins came in and handed his car and his championship chances to Fangio. Behra had retired early with a magneto problem in his own car and took over his teammate Umberto Maglioli&#x27;s car; but he retired that car, too. Musso ended up leading after Moss ran out of fuel coming through Vialone. Moss was able to refuel his car and storm off after Musso and eventually the Italian retired with steering problems, and Moss, with Fangio catching him up fast, stormed round the track to take victory. Fangio took second and his fourth Drivers&#x27; Championship.

1957 saw the organizers choose to use the road circuit only, as the rough, poorly constructed banking had caused problems for the Ferrari and Maserati cars the year before. Moss won again in a Vanwall, and Briton Tony Brooks won next year&#x27;s race, and Moss won the 1959 event in a Cooper-Climax. 1960, however was not so straightforward. Ferrari with their front-engined cars, had lost out to the advanced mid-engined British cars. Seeing an opportunity, the Italian organizers decided to re-include the banking with the road circuit, making Monza even faster and more in favour to the powerful Ferraris. The British teams were unhappy as they cited the fragility of the banking, which was extremely rough, had a concrete surface instead of asphalt, was of very poor quality and was supported by stilts rather than solid bedrock; the argument being that it was too dangerous for Formula One cars. The British teams boycotted the race, so Ferrari had no competition. American Phil Hill took victory, in what was the last victory for a front-engined Formula One car.

1961 saw a return to the combined circuit, but it was to see yet another tragedy. Two Ferrari drivers, Hill and German count Wolfgang von Trips, came into the race with a chance at winning the championship. Fighting for fourth place while Hill was leading and while von Trips approached the Parabolica, the Briton Jim Clark slightly moved over into the path of the German and the two collided. Von Trips crashed into an embankment next to the road and then went flying into a crowd of people standing on it. Von Trips was thrown out of his car and was killed, as were 14 spectators. Clark survived but was hounded by Italian police for months after the incident. Hill won the race and the championship by one point. The race was not stopped, allegedly to assist rescue work for the injured.
1962 saw a return to the road circuit only and the banking was never used again for Formula One. It still stands, but in decrepit condition for a long time before being restored in the early 2010s; the last time it was used was in 1969 for the 1000 kilometre sports car race that year. Briton Graham Hill won the race, and won the Drivers&#x27; Championship in South Africa soon afterward. 1963 saw an attempted use of the extremely fast full circuit again, and the drivers ran the course during Friday practice but the concrete banking was so rough and bumpy that cars were being mechanically torn apart. It was feared that there would be no finishers for the race itself. Briton Bob Anderson&#x27;s Lola crashed after losing a wheel on the banking, although he was not injured); the drivers then threatened to walk off unless they raced on the road circuit only, which is what happened. Jim Clark won the race in a Lotus. Ferrari driver John Surtees won in 1964, and Briton Jackie Stewart won his first of 27 Grand Prix victories in 1965, driving for BRM. Against team orders, he fought hard with his teammate Graham Hill, Hill made a mistake at the Parabolica and Stewart was in command; this was all to the chagrin of team boss Tony Rudd. 1966 saw Italian Ludovico Scarfiotti win, and no other Italian has won the race since. 1967 was to be a race of interest and was to produce the first of three close finishes on the fast Monza circuit over the next four years. Surtees, now driving for Honda, battled with Australian Jack Brabham, and Surtees won the race by two-tenths of a second; and Clark, who had problems at the beginning of the race and lost a whole lap, stormed around the circuit, equalled his pole position time and unlapped himself to take the lead- but his fuel pump broke and he coasted over the line to finish third. 1969 saw four drivers; Stewart, Austrian Jochen Rindt, Frenchman Jean-Pierre Beltoise and New Zealander Bruce McLaren battle right down to the line. Stewart came out on top and beat Rindt by eight-hundredths of a second. The four drivers were all within two-tenths of a second of each other. With this win, Stewart won his first of three championships.1970 saw Rindt&#x27;s fatal crash during qualifying at the wheel of his rear wing-less Lotus; his car suffered brake shaft failure, veered off the track, hit and went under the improperly-secured guardrail on the left and spun multiple times. Rindt died not because of the impact but because he had not properly secured his seat belts and the buckle had slit his throat. Rindt became the only posthumous World Champion, after Ferrari driver Jacky Ickx failed to overhaul Rindt. Ickx&#x27;s teammate Clay Regazzoni won the race, which saw 28 lead changes. 1971 was to see the third close finish in four years. Briton Peter Gethin, Swede Ronnie Peterson, Frenchman François Cevert, Briton Mike Hailwood and New Zealander Howden Ganley battled for the lead all race. On the last lap, Peterson got the inside line for the Parabolica, but Gethin got in front going alongside Peterson through the long right-hand corner, and beat Peterson to the checkered flag by the slimmest of margins; one-one hundredth of a second. Cevert and Hailwood finished within two-tenths and Ganley was half a second behind.

1972 saw changes to Monza. The 1971 race was the fastest Formula One race ever at that point in time. It was really just a bunch of straights and fast corners and F1 cars had become increasingly advanced and much faster, and the drivers were constantly slipstreaming each other around the circuit. A small chicane was put at the end of the pit straight and another one at the Vialone curve; Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi won that race and his first Drivers&#x27; Championship at only 25 years of age. His chief rival Jackie Stewart went out at the start with a broken gearbox. In 1973, Stewart punctured a tire early in the race and went into the pits to have it changed; he came out in 20th place and finished fourth in the race while Fittipaldi finished second; this was enough for Stewart to win his third and final Drivers&#x27; Championship. 1974 saw further changes with the Vialone chicane changed and renamed Variante Ascari, which was the place where Alberto Ascari was killed in 1955 testing a Ferrari sportscar. Like the year before, Peterson won and Fittipaldi finished second, now driving for McLaren. 1975, however, was an event to remember. Ferrari, which had regrouped completely under the leadership of Luca di Montezemolo, reached the high point of its resurgence.
The Ferrari camp was feeling relaxed while rising star and championship leader Niki Lauda was leading the Drivers&#x27; Championship, and the team was leading the Constructors&#x27; Championship. Fittipaldi and Argentine Carlos Reutemann had to win in order to have a chance at staying in the championship chase. When the race started, Lauda&#x27;s teammate Clay Regazzoni took the lead, with Lauda following; and Fittipaldi stormed round the circuit in an effort to catch the two Ferraris. Fittipaldi passed Lauda for second but this did not matter as Lauda only needed fifth to secure the drivers&#x27; title. Regazzoni took victory, followed by Fittipaldi and Lauda, who won his first drivers&#x27; title and Ferrari also won the Constructors&#x27; Championship at the same event. 1976 saw further changes to Monza&#x27;s layout. Two chicanes, called Variante Rettifilo were installed just before the Curva Grande, and another chicane, the Variante della Roggia, was installed just before the Lesmo bends. Lauda, who had come back to racing only six weeks after his horrendous crash at the Nürburgring; finished fourth while Peterson won. 1977 saw Italian-American Mario Andretti win in a Lotus; but the next year&#x27;s race was to add another page of tragedy to Monza&#x27;s history.

Peterson had re-joined Lotus at the beginning of the 1978 season and had challenged his teammate Andretti all the way. Peterson had crashed his car in practice, and had to use Andretti&#x27;s spare car, not a comfortable fit for the tall Swede, in contrast to the diminutive American. As the race started, there was a huge, fiery multi-car pile-up on the approach to the first corner. One of the victims was Peterson; his car slammed head-on into the Armco barriers and had caught fire. Instead of the ill-equipped marshals, Briton James Hunt, with the help of Frenchman Patrick Depailler and Regazzoni ran towards Peterson&#x27;s aid and pulled him out of the burning Lotus. Peterson suffered severe leg injuries, and he died from embolism complications a day later. With Peterson&#x27;s retirement from the race, Andretti won the Drivers&#x27; Championship. The race itself was an interesting one; during the parade lap South African Jody Scheckter lost a wheel from his Wolf at the second Lesmo curve and hit an Armco barrier right next to the track. Andretti, Hunt, Lauda, Fittipaldi and Reutemann went to inspect the damage, and they refused to start until it had been repaired; and it was repaired in time; although the race started well after it was supposed to. The cars were shown the green light while the back half of the field was still in motion (this often happened at Monza and it had happened during the first start); and due to the visible excitement of the start official Andretti and Canadian Gilles Villeneuve jumped the start and were penalised a minute; Lauda went on to take victory in his Alfa-powered Brabham in a shortened race distance; it was getting dark by the time the checkered flag was shown to the Austrian driver. 1979 saw changes to Monza, run off areas were added to the Curva Grande and Lesmo corners and the track was upgraded. Scheckter, now driving for Ferrari, won the race and the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

===Imola 1980 and Monza&#x27;s further redevelopments===
In 1979, it was announced that the Autodromo Dino Ferrari, also known as Imola, would host the Italian Grand Prix for 1980 while Monza underwent a major upgrade, including building a new pit complex. The Imola circuit had been used for a non-championship event in 1979 and had hosted a variety of non-championship races since 1953; this circuit was closer to the Ferrari factory in Maranello. Imola&#x27;s one-time running of the Italian GP was won by Brazilian Nelson Piquet after the two turbo Renaults of Jean-Pierre Jabouille and René Arnoux retired.
The Italian Grand Prix returned to Monza for 1981, and it has stayed there ever since. The Imola circuit was not to leave Formula One, it hosted the San Marino Grand Prix from 1981 to 2006. The 1981 Italian Grand Prix was won by rising star Alain Prost, and that race saw Briton John Watson have a huge accident at the second Lesmo Curve which also took out Italian Michele Alboreto. Watson was uninjured in his carbon-fibre McLaren. 1982 was won by Prost&#x27;s teammate René Arnoux; and Prost also won the exciting 1985 event, this time driving a McLaren.

Prost&#x27;s championship rivals Alboreto (now driving a Ferrari) and Finn Keke Rosberg in a Williams both retired. 1988 saw a memorable win; as McLaren had won every race up to the Italian Grand Prix; Prost had gone out with engine problems and his teammate Ayrton Senna had crashed into a backmarker with two laps to go- and Austrian Gerhard Berger in a Ferrari took victory, followed by Alboreto to make it a Ferrari 1–2. This was particularly memorable because Enzo Ferrari had died a month before this event.

1989 saw Prost win after the Honda engine in Senna&#x27;s McLaren expired; but Senna took victory the following year. 1991 saw a battle between Senna and the two Williams drivers of Nigel Mansell and Riccardo Patrese. Mansell won, Senna finished 2nd and Patrese went out with gearbox problems. Senna won again in 1992, and 1993 saw Williams drivers Alain Prost and Damon Hill battle hard, and while leading, Prost&#x27;s engine failed and Hill went on to take victory.

In response to the Imola tragedies in 1994, the second Lesmo curve was slowed down but the race risked being canceled due to the bureaucratic and environmental difficulties of modifying the track. Other changes were made in 1995 at &quot;Curva Grande&quot;, &quot;Variante della Roggia&quot; and both Lesmo Corners, which were anticipated for to create wider runoff areas. 1996 saw Michael Schumacher win for Ferrari, and 1999 saw championship leader Mika Hakkinen crash and the Finn, false to temperament, went behind a few bushes in the circuit and broke down crying. 2000 saw further changes to the circuit, which have stayed since; the Variante Rettifilo was made into a two corner sequence instead of a three corner sequence. The race that year started off tragically, as an accident during the start at the Variante della Roggia resulted in a marshal being struck in the head and chest by a loose wheel from German Heinz-Harald Frentzen&#x27;s Jordan. 33-year-old Paolo Gislimberti was given a heart massage at the scene, but later died from his injuries. On a more positive note, the decade also started off with a romp of Ferrari victories, winning in 2000 and 2002–2004. 
After winning the 2006 Italian Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher announced his retirement from Formula 1 racing at the end of the 2006 season. Kimi Räikkönen replaced him at Ferrari from the start of the 2007 season. At the 2008 Italian Grand Prix, Sebastian Vettel became the youngest driver in history to win a Formula One Grand Prix. Aged 21 years and 74 days, Vettel broke the record set by Fernando Alonso at the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix by 317 days as he won in wet conditions at Monza.

Vettel led for the majority of the Grand Prix and crossed the finish line 12.5 seconds ahead of McLaren&#x27;s Heikki Kovalainen. Earlier in the weekend, he had already become the youngest pole sitter, after setting the fastest times in both Q2 and Q3 qualifying stages. His win also gave him the record of youngest podium-finisher. Vettel also won in 2011, after a spectacular pass at the Curva Grande, passing Fernando Alonso on the outside of the big, long curve.

Uncertainty grew over the fact that Monza would continue to host the race as Rome had signed a deal to host Formula One from 2012. On 18 March 2010 however, Bernie Ecclestone and the Monza track managers signed a deal which assured the race being held there until at least 2016.

The 2020 Italian Grand Prix saw the fastest ever qualifying lap, set by Lewis Hamilton in a Mercedes car in a time of 1:18.887 at an average speed of .

A total of eleven Italian drivers have won the Italian Grand Prix; seven before World War II and four when it was part of the World Championship; most recently Ludovico Scarfiotti won in 1966. Alberto Ascari won the race three times (once before Formula One and twice during the Formula One championship). Elio de Angelis and Riccardo Patrese both won the San Marino Grand Prix in 1985 and 1990 respectively, so they won on home soil but not at Monza. Both Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton have won the Italian Grand Prix five times and Nelson Piquet has won it four times. Ferrari have won their home Grand Prix 20 times, the most recent being Charles Leclerc in 2024.

The 2023 Italian Grand Prix set the record for the duration of the shortest race, not counting prematurly ended races, running for 1:13:41.143, breaking the previous record belonging to the 2003 Italian Grand Prix, which ran for 1:14:19.838.

<text>Humanists UK, known from 1967 until May 2017 as the British Humanist Association (BHA), is a charitable organisation which promotes secular humanism and aims to represent &quot;people who seek to live good lives without religious or superstitious beliefs&quot; in the United Kingdom by campaigning on issues relating to humanism, secularism, and human rights. It seeks to act as a representative body for non-religious people in the UK.

The charity also supports humanist and non-religious ceremonies in England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and the Crown dependencies and maintains a national network of accredited celebrants for humanist funeral ceremonies, weddings, and baby namings, in addition to a network of volunteers who provide like-minded support and comfort to non-religious people in hospitals and prisons. Its other charitable activities include providing free educational resources to teachers, parents, and institutions; a peer-to-peer support service for people who face difficulties leaving coercive religions and cults; work to promote tolerance and understanding between religious communities and the non-religious; and work to promote understanding of humanism. The current president of Humanists UK is Adam Rutherford and the chief executive is Andrew Copson. The association currently has 70 affiliated regional and special interest groups and claims a total of approximately 140,000 members and supporters.

Humanists UK also has sections which run as staffed national humanist organisations in both Wales and Northern Ireland. Wales Humanists and Northern Ireland Humanists each have an advisory committee drawn from the membership and a development officer. Wales Humanists and Northern Ireland Humanists campaign on devolved issues in Cardiff and Belfast and work to expand the provision of humanist ceremonies, pastoral care, and support for teachers in those countries.

==Aims==
The organisation&#x27;s Articles of Association sets out its charitable aims as:
* The advancement of Humanism, namely a non-religious ethical lifestance the essential elements of which are a commitment to human wellbeing and a reliance on reason, experience and a naturalistic view of the world.
* The advancement of education and in particular the study of and the dissemination of knowledge about Humanism and about the arts and science as they relate to Humanism.
* The promotion of equality and non-discrimination and the protection of human rights as defined in international instruments to which the United Kingdom is party, in each case in particular as relates to religion and belief.
* The promotion of understanding between people holding religious and non-religious beliefs so as to advance harmonious cooperation in society.

Reflecting these, Humanists UK&#x27;s 2021–2025 strategy defines its remit as:

It defines its three strategic outcomes as:
# More people knowing what humanism is and more people with humanist beliefs and values identifying themselves as humanists
# More non-religious people living happier, more confident, and more ethical lives
# More people enjoying greater freedom of thought, freedom of expression, and freedom of choice over their own lives

These three strands cover, broadly speaking, Humanists UK&#x27;s education work, interfaith dialogue, and public awareness campaigns; the charity&#x27;s support programmes offering direct support, including pastoral support and humanist ceremonies; and its public policy agenda, which includes lobbying on human rights and equalities issues.

==History==
===Ethical Union (1896-1967)===
The organisation traces its origins to the Union of Ethical Societies, which was founded in 1896 under the leadership of American-born Stanton Coit. The Union brought together the numerous ethical societies existing in Britain. Amongst the important founding figures was Lady Elizabeth Swann (who presided over the inaugural conference). Other figures included the feminist writer Zona Vallance (its first Secretary), executive committee member May Seaton-Tiedeman (also a suffragist and divorce law campaigner) and the writer and critic Leslie Stephen (father of Virginia Woolf). Stephen served multiple terms as President of the West London Ethical Society.

The Union of Ethical Societies changed its name to the Ethical Union in 1920 and was incorporated in 1928. In 1963 H. J. Blackham became the first executive director.

In this period, the Ethical Union&#x27;s projects focused on addressing legal and social barriers to non-religious people, as well as the needs of the urban poor, racial minorities, and elderly. Such projects included the Humanist Housing Association founded in 1955 (which exists today as Origin Housing), the Agnostics Adoption Society, later known as the Independent Adoption Society (IAS) founded in 1963 (made obsolete in the 1980s by non-discrimination laws), and the Humanist Counselling Service in 1960 (partially subsumed by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy), and the umbrella network Secular Organisations for Sobriety (providing evidence-based, non-religious alternatives to the twelve-step programmes).

===British Humanist Association (1967-2017)===
The Ethical Union became the British Humanist Association (BHA) in 1967, during the Presidency of philosopher A. J. Ayer. This transition followed a decade of discussions which nearly prompted a merger of the Ethical Union with the Rationalist Press Association and the South Place Ethical Society. In 1963 the first two went as far as creating an umbrella Humanist Association of which Harold Blackham was the executive director.

In the 1960s, the organisation campaigned for reform of the Education Act 1944&#x27;s clauses on religion in schools and it was active in the campaign to legalise abortion and homosexuality. It supported repeal of Sunday Observance laws and the end of theatre censorship, the provision of family planning on the NHS and other reforms. More generally the BHA aimed to defend freedom of speech, support the elimination of world poverty and remove the privileges given to religious groups. It was claimed in 1977 that the BHA aimed &quot;to make humanism available and meaningful to the millions who have no alternative belief.&quot;

The local ethical societies united in 1896 had (mainly during the 1950s) renamed themselves as humanist groups and their number grew over time, becoming today&#x27;s network of affiliated local humanist groups. A network of celebrants able to conduct non-religious funerals, weddings, naming ceremonies and same sex affirmations (before the law allowing gay civil partnerships) was also developed and continues today as Humanist Ceremonies.

Social concerns persisted in the BHA&#x27;s programme. The BHA was a co-founder in 1969 of the Social Morality Council (later transmuted into the Norham Foundation), which brought together believers and unbelievers concerned with moral education and with finding agreed solutions to moral problems in society. The BHA was active in arguing for voluntary euthanasia and the right to obtain an abortion. It has always sought an &quot;open society&quot;. It is credited with substantially popularising the salience and use of the concept in Britain. In 1969 it held an influential conference, &quot;Towards an Open Society,&quot; at the Royal Festival Hall.

Throughout the period, the number of people professing no religion grew steadily. This led to the creation of new programmes, as well as older programmes becoming redundant due to market forces stepping in or government action. For example, growing numbers of non-religious people led to numerous new housing associations forming which did not impose religious restrictions on who could use their services. The Humanist Housing Service was spun off from the BHA and acquired by a commercial provider. Meanwhile, the BHA&#x27;s adoption service, whose focus had been non-discriminatory and interracial adoption, became obsolete following national anti-racism legislation. Still, new services came into being to suit the needs of the times, including the Humanist Bereavement Project. The Humanist Counselling Service, whose early work had been subsumed by the development of the BACP, was restarted in the 1990s response to growing awareness of discrimination and mistreatment of non-religious prisoners, hospital patients, and armed forces members in chaplaincy-based support services. This programme was re-established in 2016 as the Non-Religious Pastoral Support Network, together with other projects under a &quot;Humanist Care&quot; programme group. Humanist Care&#x27;s other service reflected the changing demographics. Faith to Faithless was founded by ex-Muslim humanists to provide specialist support to people leaving high-control religions and cults, who are sometimes labelled apostates and subjected to shunning and honour-based violence.

The BHA also campaigned for reform of BBC broadcasting policy, including preferential treatment of religions and &quot;religious privilege&quot; in broadcast scheduling. Throughout the period, it told the BBC that its policy banning non-religious people from appearing on the Thought for the Day slot in Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today programme&quot; was discriminatory. In April 2009 a &quot;breakthrough&quot; in the BHA&#x27;s campaign saw Andrew Copson invited to participate as a humanist representative in the BBC&#x27;s short-lived Standing Conference on Religion and Belief when it replaced the Central Religious Advisory Committee.

===Humanists UK (2017-present)===
In May 2017, the BHA changed its operating name to Humanists UK. Its chief executive, Andrew Copson, said that the change followed &quot;a long, evidence-driven process with focus groups of non-religious people across the UK and research involving over 4,000 of our supporters... Humanists UK represents not just a new logo, but a totally new, friendly look that captures the essence of humanism: open, inclusive, energetic, and modern, with people and their stories placed first and foremost...&quot;.

By the 2020s, Humanists UK had achieved several key victories in relation to its service provision. Following changed NHS England and prison service guidelines on pastoral care, non-religious pastoral carers were embedded in many NHS trusts and local prisons as an example of best practice, and Humanists UK was an integral part of the spiritual care sector. In 2023, the Ministry of Defence awarded Humanists UK endorsing authority status to provide humanist pastoral carers to serve alongside religious chaplains in the army, navy, and air force. The Welsh Parliament also appointed a humanist pastoral carer to Welsh politicians, reflecting the significant non-religious population in Wales.

During the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, Humanists UK was part of the Government&#x27;s moral and ethical advisory group, on the basis that humanists conducted a more significant share of British funerals than many religions. At the peak of the first national lockdown, Humanists UK organised a virtual &quot;national memorial ceremony&quot; led by its then-President Alice Roberts, Mark Gatiss, Joan Bakewell and others. Humanist funeral celebrants and pastoral carers were designated as &quot;key workers&quot; during lockdowns in the United Kingdom, and Humanists UK directed thousands of its members towards volunteering with mutual aid programmes and food banks, and in support of the Covid vaccine rollout. Humanists UK&#x27;s Chief Executive was also invited by NHS England to lead a national ceremony of commemoration for NHS staff in 2021.

A number of perennial humanist campaigns saw success or significant progress in the late 2010s and early 2020s, including the legal recognition of humanist weddings in Northern Ireland and Jersey. Humanists UK also counted other wins around organ donation registers across the UK, same-sex marriage and legal abortion in Northern Ireland (later itself conducting the first same-sex marriages), legal changes to allow early stage at-home terminations of pregnancy, and the creation of Safe Access Zones around abortion clinics in response to rising levels of harassment experienced there. A major legal win concerning Religious Education curriculums in 2022 also led to humanists soon joining most Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education as full members.

In 2021, Humanists UK celebrated its 125th anniversary. It launched a new Humanist Heritage website, cataloguing much of its 125-year history and the wider history of humanism in the UK, and received cross-party video messages of congratulations from the Leader of the Opposition and Labour, Sir Keir Starmer; the First Minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish National Party, Nicola Sturgeon; from the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Edward Davey; the co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, Siân Berry; and a warm letter of thanks from the Conservative UK Government.

Humanists UK, the Rationalist Association and the South Place Ethical Society (now Conway Hall Ethical Society) remain separate entities today.

==Campaigns==
===Schools===
The organisation opposes faith schools because &quot;The majority of the evidence [...] points towards their being an unfair and unpopular part of our state education system which the majority of people in Britain want them phased out.&quot; In addition, they argue that faith schools are &quot;exclusive, divisive and counter intuitive to social cohesion&quot; and blame religious admissions procedures for &quot;creating school populations that are far from representative of their local populations in religious or socio-economic terms.&quot;

While the organisation is opposed to faith schools receiving any state funding whatsoever, it supports the Fair Admissions Campaign which has a more limited scope because &quot;it furthers our aims of ending religious discrimination and segregation in state schools; and secondly because we know how important this particular topic is.&quot; The organisation campaigns for reform of Religious Education in the UK including a reformed subject covered by the national curriculum which is inclusive of non-religious viewpoints, such as &quot;Belief and Values Education&quot;. They believe that &quot;all pupils in all types of school should have the opportunity to consider philosophical and fundamental questions, and that in a pluralist society we should learn about each other&#x27;s beliefs, including humanist ones&quot;.

Humanists UK President-elect Alice Roberts was criticised for sending her child to a faith school, despite Humanists UK&#x27;s campaign against state-funded religious schools. She responded that this was the very point of the campaign: that she, like many other parents, had little choice over where to send her child and that she would have preferred a non-faith school option local to her.

Humanists UK also support humanist volunteers on the local Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education which currently determine the Religious Education syllabus for each local authority. Educational issues have always featured prominently in Humanists UK campaigns activities, including efforts to abolish compulsory daily collective worship in schools and to reform Religious Education so that it is &quot;Objective, Fair and Balanced&quot; (the title of an influential 1975 booklet) and includes learning about humanism as an alternative life stance.

The organisation opposes the teaching of creationism in schools. In September 2011, Humanists UK launched their &quot;Teach evolution, not creationism&quot; campaign, which aimed to establish statutory opposition to creationism in the UK education system. The Department for Education amended the funding agreement for free schools to allow the withdrawal of funding if they teach creationism as established scientific fact. In 2019, Humanists UK&#x27;s Wales Humanists branch revived the campaign in partnership with David Attenborough after the Welsh Department of Education omitted to include similar safeguards against teaching creationism in schools.

Humanists UK has long campaigned in opposition to collective worship laws in the UK which require all schools to hold school assemblies &quot;of a broadly Christian character&quot;. In 2019, the charity backed two parents to take a human rights challenge to those laws, arguing that the state had a duty to treat non-religious pupils equally and by effectively isolating those who withdraw from compulsory worship, discrimination occurs. Later that year, Humanists UK launched a new website, Assemblies for All, which compiles school assembly resources from NGOs, charities, government sources, the BBC, and businesses to make it possible for teachers and school leaders to put on &quot;inclusive assemblies&quot; on diverse topics – including the environment, mental health, and public holidays – as opposed to the collective worship required by law.

Through its education website Understanding Humanism, the charity also provides resources to teachers who want to include humanist perspectives and information about humanism in lessons.

===Constitutional reform===
The organisation campaigns for a secular state, which it defines as &quot;a state where public institutions are separate from religious institutions and treat all citizens impartially regardless of their religious or non-religious beliefs.&quot; It points to issues such as the joint role of the British monarch (both Supreme Governor of the Church of England and Head of State), the reserved places for bishops in the House of Lords, the status of the Church of England (the officially established church), and other &quot;discriminations based on religion or belief within the system&quot; such as those in education and Public Services.

===Ethical issues===

Humanists UK has supported the rights for those who need assistance in ending their own lives, and lobbied parliament for a change in the law, on behalf of Tony Nicklinson and Paul Lamb, in their &#x27;Right to Die&#x27; legal cases. In 2014, it intervened in a Supreme Court case in which the court stated it would rule again on a potential declaration of incompatibility between restrictions on the right to die and the Human Rights Act should Parliament fail to legislate decisively. In February 2019 they helped form the Assisted Dying Coalition, a group of like-minded campaign groups seeking to legalise assisted dying for the terminally ill or incurably suffering.

Persistent campaigns include defending legal abortion in Great Britain and securing its decriminalisation and its legalisation in Northern Ireland, defending embryonic stem cell research for medical purposes, challenging the state funding of homeopathy through the National Health Service, and calling for consistent and humane law on the slaughter of animals. It has also campaigned for &#x27;opt-out&#x27; organ donor registers to improve the availability of life-saving organs in the UK; Wales became the first part of the UK to adopt such a register in 2015. Jersey followed in 2019, to be followed by England in 2020.

The organisation also campaigns on marriage laws, demanding full equality for same-sex and humanist marriage ceremonies throughout the UK. Humanists UK had been providing same-sex wedding ceremonies for decades, and had strongly supported legalising same-sex marriage years in advance of eventual UK and Scottish legislation. In 2013, it secured an amendment to the same sex-marriage bill to require UK Government to consult on letting humanist celebrants conduct legal marriages. Though the consultation result strongly indicated that legalisation should go ahead, ministers have so far declined to use the order-making powers to effect the change. It also campaigns for same-sex and humanist marriages in Northern Ireland. In 2017, it supported a humanist couple to challenge Northern Ireland&#x27;s refusal to give legal recognition to humanist marriages through the High Court in Belfast, which resulted in legalisation of humanist marriages in Northern Ireland in June 2017. After campaigning to legalise same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, it celebrated its success with a promotional billboards across Belfast emblazoned, &#x27;Love wins for everybody&#x27;, advertising humanist ceremonies.

The charity has been consistently supportive of LGBT rights across its history. It was also among the first organisations to protest Section 28 in the late 1980s, and was one of the most vocal and longstanding advocates of a ban on gay conversion therapy, which it denounces as &quot;religious pseudoscience&quot; with harmful consequences. This eventually led to a 2018 commitment from the UK Government to ban the practice. Its humanist celebrants conducted non-legal partnership/wedding ceremonies for same-sex couples for many decades prior to the law changing.

Many of its campaigns are based on free speech and human rights legislation and it has based much of its campaigning on the Human Rights Act 1998. In 2008, the blasphemy law was repealed, an issue over which Humanists UK had long campaigned. It sought unification of existing anti-discrimination legislation and contributed to the Discrimination Law Review which developed the Equality Act 2006 and then the Equality Act 2010.

In January 2008 Humanists UK (known as the BHA at the time) and the National Secular Society approached the Scouts Association about a conflict between the claims of inclusivity on their website and their oath. In February 2008 journalists Bryan Appleyard and Deborah Orr criticised both Humanists UK and the National Secular Society for the (ultimately successful) campaign to end discrimination against non-religious children in the Scouts&#x27; Oath of Allegiance. In April 2008 Jonathan Petre, The Daily Telegraph religious affairs journalist, countered this position pointing out that the Scout Oath of Allegiance was discriminatory. After consultation with Humanists UK over a five-year period, Girlguiding UK in June 2013 and eventually the UK Scout Association in October 2013 recognised the discrimination and amended their oaths to accommodate non-religious young people from 1 January 2014.

In the 2020s, Humanists UK was one of the charities at the forefront of campaigns to defend the Human Rights Act and the freedom to instigate judicial review from threats of being watered down or repealed. It assembled a large civil society coalition of charities, trade unions, and human rights organisations speaking in defence of the present settlement.

===Public awareness===

On 21 October 2008, Humanists UK lent its official support to &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Ariane Sherine as she launched a fundraising drive to raise money for the UK&#x27;s first atheist advertising campaign, the Atheist Bus Campaign. The campaign aimed to raise funds to place the slogan &quot;There&#x27;s probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life&quot; on the sides of 30 London buses for four weeks in January 2009. Expecting to raise £5,500 over six months, the atheist author Richard Dawkins agreed to match donations up to £5,500 to make £11,000 total. The campaign raised over £153,000, enabling a nationwide advertising campaign to be launched on 6 January 2009.

On 8 January 2009 Christian Voice announced they had made an official complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority asserting that the Atheist Bus slogan broke rules on &quot;substantiation and truthfulness&quot;. In total the ASA received 326 complaints about the campaign, with many claiming that the wording was offensive to the religious, however Humanists UK contested the complaint and commented on the plausibility of the ASA making a claim as to the &quot;probability of God&#x27;s existence&quot;. Robert Winston criticised the campaign as &quot;arrogant&quot;. The ASA ruled that the slogan was not in breach of advertising code.

In 2011, Humanists UK campaigned to get atheists, agnostics and other non-believers to tick the &quot;no religion&quot; box in response to the optional religion question in the 2011 census (as opposed to writing in either a joke religion like &quot;Jedi&quot; or ticking the religion one grew up in). Humanists UK believed the question was worded in such a way as to increase the number of currently non-religious or nominally religious people who list the religion they grew up in rather than their current religious views, and thus the results would have been skewed to make the country seem more religious than it actually is. Humanists UK believes that this supposed overstatement of religious belief creates a situation where &quot;public policy in matters of religion and belief will unduly favour religious lobbies and discriminate against people who do not live their lives under religion&quot;.

Posters for the campaign which used the slogan &quot;If you&#x27;re not religious, for God&#x27;s sake say so&quot; were refused by companies owning advertising hoardings in railway stations following advice from the Advertising Standards Authority who believe the adverts had &quot;the potential to cause widespread and serious offence&quot;.

The Census results for England and Wales showed that 14.1 million people, about a quarter of the entire population (25%), stated they had no religion at all, a rise of 6.4 million since the 2001 census. Humanists UK said the fall in the number of Christians from 72% to below 60% was &quot;astounding&quot;, and calculated that they could be in a minority by 2018.

Set up in 2010, the Resolution Revolution campaign aims to &quot;[recast] the tired old New Year resolution – so often about breaking a negative habit – as a pledge to do something positive for others&quot;. Participation is open to all and not restricted to humanists or the non-religious.

In 2014, Humanists UK launched two public awareness campaigns. The first, called &quot;That&#x27;s Humanism!&quot;, was an Internet-based campaign revolving around four videos on humanist responses to ethics, happiness, death, and the scientific method, as narrated by its distinguished supporter, Stephen Fry. The videos, which were widely shared on social media, were intended to introduce non-religious people who were humanist in their outlook to the existence of a community of like-minded people living their lives on the basis of reason and empathy. The second campaign, called &quot;Thought for the Commute&quot;, was a London Underground campaign featuring posters depicting humanist responses from Virginia Woolf, George Eliot, Bertrand Russell and A.C. Grayling to the question &quot;What&#x27;s it all for?&quot; The campaign intended to be a positive introduction to Humanism for commuters, as well as to highlight the exclusion of humanist voices from BBC slots such as &quot;Thought for the Day&quot;. After announcing that it intended to replicate it in other UK cities, the campaign moved to bus posters in Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool for four weeks in November and December 2014, this time depicting humanist responses from Jim Al-Khalili, Jawaharlal Nehru, Natalie Haynes and Russell once again.

==Organisation==

===Presidents===

Prior to the creation of a president of the Union of Ethical Societies in 1918, and that of chair in 1916, several others held the equivalent role of Chair of the Annual Congress. The very first of these was a woman, the philanthropist and activist Lady Elizabeth Swann, who was the wife of a prominent liberal MP. She presided over the founding Congress of the Union in 1896. Other early chairs of the Annual Congress included then-future Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald (1900-1901 and again in 1903).

In April 2011, it was announced that Professor A.C. Grayling would succeed Polly Toynbee as president of Humanists UK in July 2011. However, in June Humanists UK announced that Professor Grayling had decided not to take up that position, because of what he described as &quot;controversy generated by activities in another area of my public life.&quot; Humanists UK stated that Polly Toynbee would continue as president until a new appointment was made later in 2011; she remained president for a further 18 months until in December 2012 it was announced that physicist Jim Al-Khalili would become president in January 2013.

===Staff===
* Andrew Copson – Chief Executive
* Richy Thompson – Director of Public Affairs and Policy
* Liam Whitton - Director of Communications and Development
* Ann-Michelle Burton - Head of People
* Luke Donnellan – Director of Understanding Humanism
* Deborah Hooper - Head of Ceremonies
* Clare Elcombe Webber – Director of Humanist Care
* Catriona McLellan – Director of Operations 
* Andrew West – Director of IT

The charity also has a staff member each based in Wales and Northern Ireland, who coordinate its national sections (or branches) Wales Humanists and Northern Ireland Humanists. These officers are in turn supported by national committees of volunteers whose advice assists the charity&#x27;s service delivery in those countries, strategic litigation, and lobbying on devolved issues at the Northern Ireland Assembly and Senedd.

===Humanist celebrants===

Humanist equivalents of otherwise religious celebrations are conducted by humanist celebrants, trained and accredited by Humanists UK across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, while the Humanist Society Scotland performs similar ceremonies in Scotland. Non-religious funerals are legal within the UK; over 8,000 funerals are carried out by humanist celebrants in England and Wales each year. Between 600 and 900 weddings and 500 baby namings per year are also conducted by Humanists UK-accredited celebrants. In England and Wales, a humanist wedding or partnership ceremony must be supplemented by a process of obtaining a civil marriage or partnership certificate through a Register Office to be legally recognised, but can be led by a Humanist celebrant.

The humanist funeral for former Welsh First Minister Rhodri Morgan at the Welsh Assembly was conducted by a Humanists UK celebrant, Lorraine Barrett and was the first national funeral in the United Kingdom to be led by a humanist celebrant.

Since 2018, Humanists UK celebrants have been able to conduct legally recognised marriages in Northern Ireland. This came about after Humanists UK supported a court case centring around its patrons, couple Laura Lacole and Eunan O&#x27;Kane.

===Pastoral carers===

Humanists UK maintains a network of roughly 150 trained and accredited volunteers in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland who go into hospitals, hospices, prisons, universities, and other settings to provide like-minded comfort and support to non-religious people during times of distress, much like a traditional religious chaplain. This network is known as the Non-Religious Pastoral Support Network. The project was initiated by data evidence which suggested that non-religious patients and inmates often refused support from a chaplain if they were themselves non-religious. Since 2014, the National Offender Management Service has recognised the legal right of prisoners to access non-religious pastoral carers, and since 2015, NHS England has recommended that every hospital in England offers a voluntary or employed non-religious carer. In 2018, Lindsay van Dijk was appointed as the first humanist to lead an NHS chaplaincy team at the Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS trust, which includes the world-renowned spinal injuries unit at Stoke Mandeville hospital. The current chair of NRPSN is Amy Walden.

=== Young Humanists ===

Young Humanists is the organisation&#x27;s youth wing, which launched early in 2015 with a number of events in cities across the UK.

===Patrons===
Numerous prominent people from the worlds of science, philosophy, the arts, politics, and entertainment are publicly aligned with Humanists UK, including Professor Alice Roberts, Tim Minchin, Stephen Fry, Matty Healy, Sandi Toksvig, Philip Pullman, and Dan Snow.

In the 20th century, key members of Humanists UK&#x27;s &quot;advisory council&quot; included Karl Popper, Vanessa Redgrave, Harold Pinter, E M Forster, Bertrand Russell, John Maynard Smith, Harry Kroto, Ludovic Kennedy, Jacob Bronowski, and Barbara Wootton.

===Affiliations===
Humanists UK is a founding member of Humanists International, and the European Humanist Federation.

In September 2008, Humanists UK joined with religious organisations, teachers&#x27; unions, and other human rights campaigns groups to found the Accord Coalition, a diverse coalition made up of groups that oppose religious segregation in education.

Humanist Students is a national federation of atheist, humanist, secularist, and skeptic societies at universities and is part of Humanists UK. Its elected delegates traditionally, alongside members of Young Humanists, represent Humanists UK at Young Humanists International events.

Humanists UK has traditionally worked closely with the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which was founded by the president of Birmingham Humanists, sexologist Martin Cole, in 1968. Humanists UK was a founding member of the BPAS &quot;We Trust Women&quot; coalition, which campaigns for the full decriminalisation of abortion throughout the UK.

The organisation supports a network of affiliated humanist groups throughout the UK and aims to encourage local campaigning, charity work, socialising, and events on a local level, and provides resources to assist the creation and running of such groups. Some of these groups are formally partnered with Humanists UK, which entitles them to added staff and promotional support, while others maintain a looser affiliate agreement. As of 2017, the number of partner groups stands at 47, with 15 affiliates.

The charity has also sponsored philosophical debates at HowTheLightGetsIn Festival.

==Lecture series==
Humanists UK runs a prestigious annual events programme, including the Darwin Day Lecture (on themes connected with Darwin&#x27;s work and humanism), the Rosalind Franklin Lecture (commemorating women in humanism), the Voltaire Lecture (on humanism more generally), the Bentham Lecture (co-hosted with University College London&#x27;s philosophy department), the Holyoake Lecture (held in Manchester and covering humanism and political thought), and an annual convention which moves around the UK from year to year.

Past speakers at these events include top scientists, authors, and academics, including Steven Pinker, Brian Cox, Richard Dawkins, Robert Hinde, AC Grayling, Natalie Haynes, Bonya Ahmed, Bettany Hughes, Alice Roberts, Nick Cohen, Ludovic Kennedy, Michael Foot, Lawrence Krauss, Eugenie Scott, Adam Rutherford, Tom Blundell, and Jerry Coyne, Anne Glover, Angela Saini, Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, Jim Al-Khalili, Owen Jones, and Kate Pickett.

<text>The Empire, Leicester Square is a cinema currently operated by Cineworld on the north side of Leicester Square, London, United Kingdom.

The Empire was originally built in 1884 as a variety theatre and was rebuilt for films in the 1920s. It is one of several cinemas in and adjoining Leicester Square which are regularly used for film premieres and first runs.

Today, it has nine auditoria, including an IMAX, a Superscreen and a 4DX screen.

==History==

===1884: The Empire Theatre opens===

The Empire Theatre opened on 17 April 1884 under the ownership of Daniel Nicols as a West End variety theatre on Leicester Square, as well as a ballet venue, with a capacity of about 2,000 seats.

The first performance was &quot;Chilpéric&quot;, with music by Hervé, adapted by H. Hersee and H. B. Farnie and described as &quot;a Grand Musical Spectacular, in three acts and seven tableaux&quot;. The corps de ballet for the performance was 50 strong. Edward Solomon and Sydney Grundy premièred their comic opera, &quot;Pocahontas or The Great White Pearl&quot;, another Solomon opera, &quot;Polly or The Pet of the Regiment&quot; transferred here, and his &quot;Billee Taylor&quot; was revived here, all in 1884. Kate Vaughan starred in &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; at the theatre in 1886. Hervé premièred his &quot;Diana&quot; (1888) and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1889) at the theatre.

In 1887, the theatre reopened as a popular music hall named the Empire Theatre of Varieties. From 1887 to 1915, the designer C. Wilhelm created both scenery and costumes for (and sometimes produced) numerous ballets at the theatre, which established a fashion for stage design and were much imitated. George Edwardes managed the theatre around the start of the 20th century. The dancer Adeline Genée and the theatre&#x27;s ballet company, working under composer-director Leopold Wenzel, did much to revive the moribund art of ballet in Britain, which had declined in the 19th century.

An extension providing secondary access from Leicester Street via a new foyer was added in 1893, with Frank Verity as the architect.

In March 1896, the Empire Theatre played host to the first commercial theatrical performances of a projected film to a UK audience by Auguste and Louis Lumière. The film programme ran for 18 months. Over the next few years, the theatre began to offer a programme of live performances with short film shows.

===1927: Rebuilt as a cinema===

As moving pictures grew in popularity in the 1920s, the freehold of the Empire was acquired for redevelopment in 1925 for over $1 million by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in partnership with Solly Joel, with its last live theatre performance being &quot;Lady Be Good&quot;, starring Fred Astaire.

Most of the theatre was demolished in 1927, with the Empire rebuilt as a film theatre on an expanded site with the auditorium block now extending East to Leicester Place; the architect was Thomas W. Lamb with assistance from F. W. Boettcher and Frederick G. M. Chancellor of Frank Matcham and Company as the local architect, and the Anglo-Scottish Construction Company Ltd was the contractor. Parts of the Frank Verity designed exterior remain visible on the West side.

It opened on 8 November 1928 with the silent film &quot;Trelawny of the Wells&quot;, based on the play by Arthur Wing Pinero.

Built as an American-style movie palace in the form of North American theatres designed by Thomas Lamb for Loew&#x27;s/MGM, it had a capacity of about 3,300 seats, and was one of the first cinemas in the UK to be fully air conditioned. It also boasted a 4/21 Wurlitzer organ, and a large stage which often hosted ballet and dance performances.

Soon after opening, MGM bought out Joel&#x27;s interest in the theatre.

====Post-war cine-variety====

After the war, the stage accommodated programmes of cine-variety–elaborate live shows, similar to those presented at the Radio City Music Hall. For these, the American producer Nat Carlson, who had been responsible for shows at that venue, was hired, and its slogan, &quot;The Showplace of the Nation,&quot; was adopted.

In 1952 the Empire featured in Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s film &quot;Limelight&quot;, and its 1927 incarnation can also be seen in archived newsreel footage of special events.

====New screen for &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; 70mm presentation====

There were reports that the cinema was to be demolished and MGM received offers to sell but in 1959, the Empire removed 1,200 seats and installed new 70mm projectors and a new screen in front of the proscenium to show &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, which ran for 76 weeks.

===1962: Reconstruction as a cinema and dance hall===

Following the long run of Ben-Hur, in 1961 the Empire was sold to Mecca and closed for internal reconstruction to create a new cinema for MGM and a dance hall for Mecca. The building was stripped out extensively, including the removal of existing partition walls and floors. Almost all of the 1920s ornate plasterwork was removed; two small sections remained, hidden behind false walls and ceilings—one section now being behind the IMAX auditorium side wall.

George Coles was the architect and G. E. Wallis and Sons was the main contractor for the new cinema.

The theatre re-opened on 19 December 1962, with &quot;Jumbo&quot;. A new 1,330-seat auditorium was formed at circle level, on a suspended precast concrete floor over the former stalls underneath, with a circle section at the rear on a new stadium seating structure, and a flatter raked stalls section towards the screen end; the auditorium had no stage facilities, and extended into the former stage house. Its side walls and ceiling were finished with acoustic plaster tiles of mink and gold colours, featured banks of concealed colour-changing cold cathode lighting, and reclining red upholstered seating was fitted.

The auditorium would later be known as Empire 1 or Screen 1.

The vestibule was subdivided with the cinema entrance on the left side, with a single staircase up to the grand foyer, its walls covered with white and black Italian marble, and a new grand foyer replaced the circle foyer, featuring a red coloured ceiling with several domes, lit with white concealed lighting.

In the former stalls, a Mecca Ballroom was constructed, with access from Leicester Square via the right half of the former cinema vestibule and stairs down to its sub-basement level. Over the years, it has been a dance hall, discothèque and nightclub, being later operated by First Leisure Corporation plc, and in 1992 it was reimagined as the Equinox Discothèque. In 2007, following further substantial reconstruction and refurbishment, it re-opened as the Casino at the Empire, which is now operated by Metropolitan Gaming, owned by Silver Point Capital.

The 1928 façade was retained but was now completely obscured by a full building hoarding advertising the current films featured and Mecca Dancing; it was not until 1989 that it was re-exposed, with a new canopy built featuring rows of semi-circular neon lights, which was subsequently altered and then completely replaced when the Casino was opened.

===1989: Refurbishment===

In 1989, Screen 1 and the lobby areas were refurbished, with Esquisse Design as the architects. Fibre optic starfields by Par Opti Projects Ltd were fitted in the foyer ceiling and in the curved proscenium arch-style flat plasterwork above the screen, and a THX-certified sound system was installed by CSI, which later became Bell Theatre Services Ltd.

This consisted of 5 JBL 4675C systems with dual 4648A LF cabinets (four 15&quot; drivers per channel), six JBL 4645 subwoofers, and 20 JBL 8330 surrounds, powered by 13 JBL/UREI dual-monoblock 6290 power amplifiers, fed from a Dolby CP200 with a THX 3417 crossover/booth monitor.

The refurbishment included the application of grey spray paint to the tiles in Screen 1, which had the unintended consequence of negatively impacting the auditorium&#x27;s acoustics. The red foyer ceilings now had a flocked finish, a 40 screen video wall was installed in the foyer, and new decorative treatments in lobby areas included mirrored finishes and exposed cold cathode lighting features. The HVAC system was upgraded with a new rooftop chiller unit.

A laser projector was also installed in Empire 1, for a short sound-and-light show; the projection was onto the tabs and walls, and the concealed lighting was sequenced. It preceded the start of each programme, proclaiming it to be &quot;The Most Spectacular Cinema in the World,&quot; and advertised the THX certified sound system.

Dolby SR-D was fitted in 1992 by adding a Dolby DA10 and CAT699 soundtrack readers; a year later, a DTS-6 system was added for the release of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, and an SDDS system was also installed.

By the mid-1990s, the laser show was discontinued; some years later, Martin Audio speakers were installed, and THX recertification was eventually dropped.

==Ownership changes==

The Empire was operated for many years by Cinema International Corporation, until it merged in 1989 with United Artists Communications Inc. to form UCI Cinemas. In 2004, UCI Cinemas merged with Odeon Cinemas to form the Odeon &amp; UCI Cinemas Group; the Office of Fair Trading required the disposal of ten former UCI sites, including the Empire Leicester Square, which in October 2005 were sold to Empire Cinemas Ltd. The Empire Leicester Square was subsequently acquired by Cineworld in July 2016, and the cinema is now known as Cineworld Leicester Square.

==21st century technical upgrades to Screen 1==
===Reinstatement of THX certification===

Following Empire Cinemas&#x27; acquisition, in 2006 the THX certification of Screen 1 was reinstated. The sound system was completely replaced by Bell Theatre Services Ltd, using 5 JBL 5632 Custom ScreenArray screen speakers, each with dual 18&quot; drivers, and 16 18&quot; JBL 4645C subwoofers, all flush with a new baffle wall built by Camstage; a rear array comprising 42 JBL 8340A surround speakers, 5 dbx DriveRack 4800 digital active crossovers, and 56 kW of Crown CTs series amplification.

CTs 2000 and 3000s were placed in racks behind the screen to ensure loudspeaker cable runs were short, and the surrounds were individually powered by 6 CTs 8200 8-channel amplifiers located in the booth.

The SDDS D2000, DTS-6Ds, Dolby CP200 and MPU-1 were serviced or refurbished and one Philips DP70 was recommissioned in order to run 70mm screenings; and were tested with Reel 1 of &quot;Dune&quot;. A Dolby CP650 was added to handle digital sources, being fitted with a CAT778 allowing AES/EBU outputs to the dbx crossovers, and was switchable to analogue for the CP200.

To help tame the auditorium&#x27;s acoustics, RPG Reapor sintered glass tiles were applied over the existing tiles.

The screen was also replaced by one wider, measuring . Film projection lenses were changed to variable-iris aspheric technology Schneider Cinelux Premières, allowing light balance centre-to-edge with improved focus and illumination uniformity.

===Dolby 3D projection and Dolby Atmos===

In May 2009, Screen 1 was equipped for the world première of &quot;Avatar&quot; with the UK&#x27;s first Dolby 3D large screen system, using 4 Barco DP3000 projectors in a dual-stacked configuration.

The UK&#x27;s first public Dolby Atmos system was installed in Screen 1 in July 2012. 14 overhead speakers (JBL AM7212 and AM7215) were installed, hanging down through holes in the ceiling, but covered over with grey fabric, and additional front side speakers and rear subwoofers were added.

==IMAX conversion of Screen 1==

In August 2013, Screen 1 was closed for a total refurbishment, to form a 723-seat IMAX auditorium and a 401-seat IMPACT auditorium (renamed Superscreen following the Cineworld acquisition.) The final screening, &quot;Big Bad Wolves&quot;, occurred on 26 August 2013 to close out FrightFest 2013, and building work commenced immediately afterwards.

The architect for the conversion was UNICK Architects, with Maeve Contractors as the main contractor.

The project involved the permanent removal of almost all existing decorative finishes and fittings, the demolition of all false ceilings, and some internal walls. A large acoustic wall was constructed, weighing 50 tonnes and hung from the 1920s roof structure, for isolation between the two auditoria.

The IMPACT (Superscreen) screen opened on 16 May 2014 with &quot;Pompeii&quot;, and the IMAX screen on 30 May 2014 with &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot;. Following the redevelopment of Screen 1, the cinema had digital projection only, with no film projection capability available.

===IMAX auditorium===

The IMAX auditorium uses the circle seating area of the former Screen 1, with its steep raking, and is the largest IMAX in the UK by seating capacity. It also has the widest cinema screen in the UK, 26.5m (87.5 feet) wide by 15.6m (51.1 feet) high; it is curved and is positioned in the former middle stalls of Empire 1. Its walls and ceilings retain essentially the same form, but with the ceiling progressively raised, reusing the 1962 curved steelwork moved up to accommodate the IMAX screen height, and altered with the front splay walls moved in. The walls and ceiling are covered with black stretched fabric over acoustic absorption, and the colour-changing concealed lighting has been reinstated using LEDs. Its seating is upholstered in black leather.

At opening, two IMAX DLP xenon light source projectors were used, which could only achieve a 24.5m (~80 feet) wide by ~13m (~42.5 feet) high image. A full set of IMAX &quot;Kanga&quot; Grand Theatre speakers were installed, supporting all 6 channels then available including upper centre.

In October 2015, the IMAX laser light source projection system (IMAX with Laser) was installed, allowing the full screen to be filled, alongside an upgrade to IMAX&#x27;s 12 channel surround sound system, for which 6 additional smaller overhead and side surround speakers were added.

===Superscreen auditorium===

The remaining area of the former Screen 1, combined with the former void area to the external wall on Leicester Place, is used for the Superscreen auditorium, which bears no resemblance in design to the former Screen 1. Its 20.5m (~67 feet) wide by 11m (~36 feet) high wall-to-wall floating screen is oriented in the opposite direction, back to back with the IMAX screen. A new stadium seating structure was constructed, and at the rear of the auditorium, on a new 17m long steel girder supported by the existing roof structure, sits a small balcony seating area, under which a small projection booth is situated.

Dolby Atmos was installed, along with a total of 87 JBL speakers powered by 85 kW of amplification. Most of the projection and sound equipment, including twin Barco DP4K-32B projectors, JBL screen speakers, Crown amplifiers, and dbx loudspeaker management units, as detailed above, was transferred from the former Screen 1, except that all surround and overhead speakers were replaced.

==History of other auditoria (Pre-Cineworld acquisition)==

===Screen 2===

Formerly the Ritz, a cinema located in the basement of an adjacent building (1–4 Leicester Square) that opened in 1937, which was originally designed as a newsreel cinema, the architect being George Coles. It was acquired by MGM for moveovers of feature films, and later renamed Empire 2. It has been refurbished several times, notably in 1970 with Sidney Kaye, Eric Firmin and Partners as the architects, and revamped in the 2000s with the addition of a new stadium seating structure.

A separate entrance was retained until the mid-1980s, subsequent to which access has been via the main cinema foyer level, by entering into a stairwell leading down to the auditorium.

===Screens 4 and 5===

These two screens were added in 2008, the first to open with digital projection only in London&#x27;s West End, built in areas formerly used as toilets and offices, respectively seating 96 and 50. Barco DP1500 projectors, Harkness screens, Crown amplifiers, JBL screen speakers and Martin Audio surround speakers, alongside reclining memory foam seating, were installed.

===Screens 7 and 8===

Opening on 29 November 1985, a 77-seat auditorium known as Empire 3 was constructed. Following its closure in 2009, its space combined with former void space, above the lower vestibule, was used to form Screens 7 and 8.

===Screens 6 and 9===

Screen 6 was built as the smallest auditorium, with 26 seats; and Screen 9, above Screen 8, was built within former offices.

==Post-Cineworld acquisition developments==

In 2018, Cineworld completed a total refurbishment of the lobby areas, and the former Screen 2 was converted to a 4DX screen.

===Foyer refurbishment===
The new foyer was designed by Innebo Architects, with Chapman Taylor as the architect for the project&#x27;s delivery.

It involved the replacement of all ceilings and the permanent removal of almost all decorative features, many of which dated from numerous changes made since the 1962 reconstruction and also the 1989 refurbishment. Of particular note, the original white marble vestibule wall finishes and the red coloured ceilings with domed features were not reinstated; however, the brass balustrading in the vestibule area was refitted.

The vestibule stairs now feature LED display modules fitted on their risers, and a large curved display formed from LED display modules is situated at the top of the vestibule. Reflective black stretched fabric has been attached to the ceilings, which are heavily accented with decorative features, consisting of coved elements and flat gold coloured squares, lit using much concealed and back LED lighting.

===4DX conversion of the former Screen 2===

The former Screen 2 was converted to a 4DX auditorium, with Chapman Taylor&#x27;s leisure team as the architect. The auditorium was altered to allow for the 4DX installation; all internal finishes were replaced, and the seating, now with a capacity of 136, was fitted to a new stadium stepping, with wider row spacing.

===Screen renumbering===

Concurrent to the lobby areas refurbishment, the screens were renumbered; Screens 5, 4, and 6 are now Screens 1, 2 and 3 respectively, and Screens 7–9 are now Screens 5–7. The 4DX, IMAX and Superscreen auditoria—4, 8 and 9 respectively—are normally referenced by name.

===Refurbishment of other screens===

Screens 1–3 and 5–7 (formerly 5, 4, 6 and 7–9) were reopened in Summer 2018, following refurbishment, which included replacement seating, all (except Screen 3) on a steeper rake.

<text>In camera (; Latin: &quot;in a chamber&quot;) is a legal term that means &quot;in private&quot;. The same meaning is sometimes expressed in the English equivalent: in chambers. Generally, &quot;in-camera&quot; describes court cases, parts of it, or process where the public and press are not allowed to observe the procedure or process. &quot;In-camera&quot; is the opposite of trial in open court where all parties and witnesses testify in a public courtroom, and attorneys publicly present their arguments to the trier of fact.

==&quot;In camera&quot; hearings during trials==
Entire cases may be heard &quot;in-camera&quot; when, for example, matters of national security are involved. &quot;In-camera&quot; review by a judge may be used during otherwise open trials—for example, to protect trade secrets or where one party asserts privilege (such as attorney–client privileged communications). This lets the judge review documents in private to determine if revelation of documents in open court will be allowed.

In United States courts, in-camera review describes a process or procedure where a judge privately looks at confidential, sensitive, or private information to determine what, if any, information may be used by a party or made public. An &quot;in camera review&quot; may be at someone&#x27;s request (such as counsel in the case), or by order of the court. 

An example of &quot;in-camera review&quot; by the court: a defendant prosecuted for the alleged murder of a high school student asserts his was an act of self-defense, a last resort after the deceased physically assaulted the defendant. Witnesses tell investigators and lawyers that the victim &quot;was always getting into fights in school&quot; and frequently had to visit the principal&#x27;s office. The defendant seeks to obtain the deceased&#x27;s high school files to see if there is anything proving the deceased fighting at school. A party for the deceased&#x27;s family might argue against disclosure on the basis that school records which are presumably private should not be provided to the defendant. While a judge might acknowledge the general presumption, the court might permit the defendant limited use at trial of any school records that may establish the deceased&#x27;s physically aggressive tendencies. 

In this example, before allowing disclosure of files to the defendant, or for revelation of the records to the jury, the judge performs an in camera inspection on the deceased&#x27;s high school records to determine what records, if any, would be released to the defendant. The judge may disallow use of some or all of the records that are reviewed, limit use or purpose of the records, and may order a party to take all steps necessary to keep private and confidential the information released.

==Non-legal definitions==
&quot;In-camera&quot; can also describe closed board meetings that cover information not recorded in the minutes or divulged to the public. Such sessions may discuss personnel, financial, or other sensitive decisions that must be kept secret (e.g., a proposed merger or strategic change the organization does not want disclosed to competitors). It can also apply to diplomatic and political affairs, such as during the American Constitutional Convention in 1787 when the drafting of the Constitution of the United States was discussed in such strict privacy so delegates could negotiate in full confidence that they were free to reconsider particular positions as necessary without embarrassment or political repercussions with their constituents. 

&quot;In camera&quot; may also mean the portion of a graduate level thesis examination that includes only the examining committee and the student. This follows a presentation by the student that the public may attend.

<text>In mathematics and computer science, computational number theory, also known as algorithmic number theory, is the study of 
computational methods for investigating and solving problems in number theory and arithmetic geometry, including algorithms for primality testing and integer factorization, finding solutions to diophantine equations, and explicit methods in arithmetic geometry.
Computational number theory has applications to cryptography, including RSA, elliptic curve cryptography and post-quantum cryptography, and is used to investigate conjectures and open problems in number theory, including the Riemann hypothesis, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, the ABC conjecture, the modularity conjecture, the Sato-Tate conjecture, and explicit aspects of the Langlands program.

<doc id="511471" wikidata="Q230889" url="?curid=511471" title="Margaret of Provence">
<text>Margaret of Provence (; 1221 – 20 December 1295) was Queen of France by marriage to King Louis IX.

==Early life==
Margaret was born in the spring of 1221 in Forcalquier. She was the eldest of four daughters of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence, and Beatrice of Savoy. Her younger sisters were Queen Eleanor of England, Queen Sanchia of Germany, and Queen Beatrice of Sicily. She was especially close to Eleanor, to whom she was close in age, and with whom she sustained a friendly relationship until they grew old.

==Queen==

In 1233, Blanche of Castile, mother of King Louis IX of France, sent one of her knights to Provence, partly to offset the troublesome Count Raymond VII of Toulouse and partly to meet Margaret, whose grace and beauty were widely reported. Margaret and her father entertained the knight well, and soon Blanche was negotiating with the count of Provence about the marriage of a daughter of his and Blanche&#x27;s son. Margaret was chosen as a good match for the king more for her religious devotion and courtly manner than her beauty. She was escorted to Lyon by her parents for the marriage treaty to be signed. From there, she was escorted to her wedding in Sens by her uncles William and Thomas of Savoy. On 27 May 1234, at the age of thirteen, Margaret married Louis. She was crowned queen of France the following day. Both the wedding and the coronation were celebrated at the cathedral of Sens.

The marriage was a difficult one in numerous aspects. Blanche still wielded strong influence over her son and would throughout her life. As a sign of her authority, Blanche dismissed Margaret&#x27;s uncles and all of the servants she had brought with her from her childhood shortly after the wedding. Margaret and Blanche resented each other from the beginning.

Margaret, like her sisters, was noted for her beauty. She was said to be &quot;pretty with dark hair and fine eyes&quot;, and in the early years of their marriage she and Louis enjoyed a warm relationship. Her Franciscan confessor, William de St. Pathus, related that on cold nights Margaret would place a robe around Louis&#x27; shoulders, when her deeply religious husband rose to pray. Another anecdote recorded by St. Pathus related that Margaret felt that Louis&#x27; plain clothing was unbecoming to his royal dignity, to which Louis replied that he would dress as she wished, if &quot;she&quot; dressed as &quot;he&quot; wished.

They enjoyed riding together, reading, and listening to music. The attentions of the king and court being drawn to the new queen only made Blanche more jealous, and she worked to keep the king and queen apart as much as possible.

===During the Seventh Crusade===
Margaret accompanied Louis on the Seventh Crusade (their first). Her sister Beatrice also joined. Though initially the crusade met with some success, such as the capture of Damietta in 1249, it became a disaster after the king&#x27;s brother was killed and the king then captured.

Queen Margaret was responsible for negotiations and gathering enough silver for his ransom. She was thus for a brief time the only woman ever to lead a crusade. In 1250, while in Damietta, where she earlier in the same year successfully maintained order, she gave birth to John Tristan.

The chronicler Jean de Joinville, who was not a priest, reports incidents demonstrating Margaret&#x27;s bravery after Louis was made prisoner in Egypt. For example, she decisively acted to assure a food supply for the Christians in Damietta and went so far as to ask the knight who guarded her bedchamber to kill her and her newborn son if the city should fall to the Arabs. She also convinced some of those who had been about to leave to remain in Damietta and defend it. Joinville also recounts incidents that demonstrate Margaret&#x27;s good humor, as on one occasion when Joinville sent her some fine cloth and, when the queen saw his messenger arrive carrying them, she mistakenly knelt down thinking that he was bringing her holy relics. When she realized her mistake, she burst into laughter and ordered the messenger, &quot;Tell your master evil days await him, for he has made me kneel to his camelines!&quot;

However, Joinville also remarked with noticeable disapproval that Louis rarely asked after his wife and children. In a moment of extreme danger during a terrible storm on the sea voyage back to France from the Crusade, Margaret begged Joinville to do something to help; he told her to pray for deliverance and to vow that when they reached France she would go on a pilgrimage and offer a golden ship with images of the king, herself and her children in thanks for their escape from the storm. Margaret could only reply that she dared not make such a vow without the king&#x27;s permission, because when he discovered that she had done so, he would never let her make the pilgrimage. In the end, Joinville promised her that if she made the vow he would make the pilgrimage for her, and when they reached France he did so.

===Political significance===

Her leadership during the crusade had brought her international prestige and after she returned to France, Margaret was often asked to mediate disputes. She feared the ambitions of her brother-in-law Charles, though, and strengthened the bond with her sister Eleanor and Eleanor&#x27;s husband, King Henry III of England, as a counterweight. In 1254, she and her husband invited them to spend Christmas in Paris.

Then, in 1259, the Treaty of Paris was concluded after the relationship between Louis and Henry had improved. Margaret was present during the negotiations along with all of her sisters and her mother.

In later years, Louis became vexed with Margaret&#x27;s ambition. It seems that when it came to politics or diplomacy she was indeed ambitious, but somewhat inept. An English envoy at Paris in the 1250s reported to the English court, evidently in some disgust, that &quot;the queen of France is tedious in word and deed,&quot; and it is clear from the envoy&#x27;s report that he was not impressed with her efforts to create an opportunity for herself to engage in affairs of state. After the death of her eldest son Louis in 1260, Margaret induced the next son, Philip, to swear an oath that no matter at what age he succeeded to the throne, he would remain under her tutelage until the age of thirty. When Louis found out about the oath, he immediately asked the pope to excuse Philip from the vow on the grounds that he himself had not authorized it, and the pope immediately obliged. This ended Margaret&#x27;s attempt to make herself a second Blanche of Castile. Margaret subsequently failed as well to influence her nephew King Edward I of England to avoid a marriage project for one of his daughters that would promote the interests in her native Provence of her brother-in-law, Charles of Anjou, who had married her youngest sister Beatrice.

==Queen dowager==
After the death of Louis IX on his second crusade in 1270, during which she remained in France, she returned to Provence. She became a more politically active figure after his death. She was particularly exigent – to the point of raising troops – in defending her rights in Provence, where Charles maintained his political authority and control of property after Beatrice&#x27;s death, contrary to the intentions of Margaret and Beatrice&#x27;s father, who had died in 1245. She was devoted to Eleanor, and they stayed in contact until Eleanor&#x27;s death in 1291. Her last years were spent doing pious work, including the founding of the Franciscan nunnery of Lourcines in 1289. 

Margaret herself died in Paris, at the Poor Clares monastery she had founded, on 20 December 1295, at the age of seventy-four. She was buried near (but not beside) her husband in the Basilica of St-Denis outside Paris. Her grave, beneath the altar steps, was never marked by a monument, so its location is unknown; probably for this reason, it was the only royal grave in the basilica that was not ransacked during the French Revolution, and it probably remains intact today.

==Issue==
King Louis IX of France and Margaret of Provence had eleven children together:
#Blanche (1240 – 29 April 1243)
#Isabella (2 March 1241 – 28 January 1271), married Theobald II of Navarre
#Louis (25 February 1244 – January 1260)
#Philip III of France (1 May 1245 – 5 October 1285), married firstly Isabella of Aragon, by whom he had issue, including Philip IV of France and Charles, Count of Valois; he married secondly Maria of Brabant, by whom he had issue, including Margaret of France.
#John (born and died in 1248)
#John Tristan (1250 – 3 August 1270), born in Egypt on his father&#x27;s first Crusade and died in Tunisia on his second

<doc id="511477" wikidata="Q3243730" url="?curid=511477" title="Brigham Young University–Hawaii">
<text>Brigham Young University–Hawaii (BYU–Hawaii) is a private college in Laie, Hawaii, United States. It is owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). BYU–Hawaii was founded in 1955 and it became a satellite campus of Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1974. In 2004, it was made a separate institution. The college&#x27;s sole focus is on undergraduate education.

The institution is broadly organized into four colleges and its parent organization, the Church Educational System (CES), sponsors sister schools in Utah and Idaho. Approximately 97 percent of the college&#x27;s 2,800 students are members of the LDS Church. BYU–Hawaii students are required to follow the Church Educational System Honor Code, which requires behavior in line with LDS teachings. 

==History==
The LDS Church was established in the islands in 1850 following the Edict of Toleration promulgated by Kamehameha III, giving the underground Hawai‘i Catholic Church the right to worship, while at the same time allowing other faith traditions to begin establishing themselves. By 1919, the church was prominent enough in the area to build a temple in Laie. Two years after the temple was dedicated then-LDS Church apostle David O. McKay stated the church would build a school in the area in the future. In 1951, McKay, as church president, began preliminary plans on the school, and in 1955 ground was broken for the new institution.
Classes began at BYU–Hawaii in September 1955 as the Church College of Hawaii to accommodate the burgeoning LDS population in the Territory of Hawai‘i. This was largely a result of McKay&#x27;s views on both education and strengthening the church outside of its longtime intermountain west U.S. base. The original class consisted of 153 students and 20 faculty meeting in old World War II buildings, with Reuben D. Law as the school&#x27;s first president. The school&#x27;s first buildings were dedicated on December 17, 1958. The college was at first a two-year college but was reorganized in 1959 to become a four-year college. By 1961 the college had been granted four-year accreditation by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Dormitories, a cafeteria, and other buildings had also been constructed.

LDS elders established the Polynesian Cultural Center in November 1963 as a means of preserving the Pacific cultures that the Latter-day Saints had encountered in their missionary work. In the 1970s, the school was also used to teach LDS missionaries Pacific languages and cultures before going out to the islands. The center also provided jobs for students of the college. In 1974, the Church College of Hawaii was renamed Brigham Young University–Hawaii by the Church Board of Education and began reporting to the president of BYU in Provo, Utah.

The school was governed as a satellite campus of BYU until 2004, when it was announced that the school would report directly to the Commissioner of Church Education. In 2007, Steven C. Wheelwright was appointed the college&#x27;s president. On May 12, 2015, Russell M. Nelson, chairman of the Executive Committee of the BYU-Hawaii Board of Trustees announced that effective July 27, 2015, John S. Tanner would succeed Wheelwright as president. On May 12, 2020, Jeffrey R. Holland, chairman of the Executive Committee of the BYU-Hawaii Board of Trustees, announced that Tanner would be succeeded as the institution&#x27;s president by John S. K. Kauwe III on July 1, 2020.

==Campus==
BYU–Hawaii is located in Laie on the north shore of Oahu, about north of Honolulu. The campus covers between the mountains and the ocean shore. Dormitories, known as &#x27;Hales&#x27;, located on the south end of campus are capable of providing room and board for over 1,200 students. The Temple View Apartments provide housing for married students. These apartments are next to the Laie Hawaii Temple which is located directly adjacent to the campus. The school&#x27;s library is the two-story Joseph F. Smith Library.

==Academics==

===Admissions and demographics===
LDS students pay less for tuition than non-LDS students. Students who have been on LDS missions and have attended LDS seminary or institute classes are also given particular consideration. However, LDS Church membership is not a requirement for attendance. Students are typically expected to have had at least a B average in high school, and an ACT score of 26 or SAT score of 1130 or above. Non-native English speakers must receive a 61 or higher on the IBT TOEFL (500 on the paper test), a 5.5 on IELTS, or 75+ on the Michigan language test.

Approximately 97% of the student body are LDS Church members.

==Organization==
BYU–Hawaii offers 37 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, with a 16:1 student/faculty ratio. 

In Fall 2018, BYU–Hawaii restructured its academic organization from four colleges to seven faculty units. The programs under the former colleges were divided among the following seven faculty units:

* Arts &amp; Letters: Communication, Media, and Culture, English, Film, Visual Arts
* Business &amp; Government: Accounting, Business Management, Entrepreneurship, Political Science, Hospitality &amp; Tourism Management 
* Culture, Language &amp; Performing Arts: Anthropology and Cultural Sustainability, Hawaiian Studies, History, Integrated Humanities, Intercultural Peacebuilding, Music, Pacific Island Studies, Theatre, World Languages
* Education &amp; Social Work: English as an International Language, Social Work, Teacher Education, TESOL
* Math &amp; Computing: Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Technology, Mathematics
* Religious Education
* Sciences: Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Exercise and Sport Science, Psychology, Physical Science, Physics

==Athletics==

BYU–Hawaii formerly competed in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division II as a member of the Pacific West Conference. The &quot;Seasiders&quot; competed in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross-country, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, volleyball, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer. Over its history, the school won two women&#x27;s volleyball and eleven tennis championships (two men&#x27;s and nine women&#x27;s, along with one women&#x27;s NCAA championship). In its early days, BYU–Hawaii also won a National Rugby Championship in 1967. Basketball and volleyball games were held in the George Q. Cannon Activities Center. The campus has several tennis courts, an outdoor swimming pool, and soccer and softball fields. Most conference home games in volleyball and women&#x27;s basketball, as well as additional home games in men&#x27;s basketball, were broadcast live around the world on BYUtv Sports.

On March 28, 2014, the college announced that the athletics program would be phased out over the next three years, with money spent on athletics to be used to provide educational opportunities for an additional 500 students. The transition impacted all eleven (11) intercollegiate teams, including: men&#x27;s/women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s/women&#x27;s cross country, men&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s/women&#x27;s soccer, softball, men&#x27;s/women&#x27;s tennis, and women&#x27;s volleyball. Athletics at BYU–Hawaii ended following the spring sports in 2017.

==Student life==

===LDS atmosphere===

According to BYU–Hawaii&#x27;s vision outlined by then-LDS Church president David O. McKay in 1955, the school &quot;exists to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life and in their efforts to influence the establishment of peace internationally.&quot;

All students are required to take religion classes as part of their curriculum and to attend Sunday church meetings, both LDS and non-LDS. In addition, class schedules are arranged to allow devotionals to be held weekly for the students to attend. Students from all walks of life are encouraged to learn from and strengthen each other as they all strive to further their education. A variety of clubs and campus organizations are available to participate in.

===Honor code===
All students and faculty are required to agree to adhere to an honor code, officially known as the CES Honor Code, but often referred to as the BYU Honor Code. Early forms of the BYU Honor Code are found as far back as the days of the Brigham Young Academy and educator Karl G. Maeser. Maeser created the &quot;Domestic Organization,&quot; which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to see that they were following the schools moral rules prohibiting premarital sex, obscenity, profanity, smoking, and alcohol consumption.

The Honor Code itself was created in 1940 at BYU and was used mainly for cases of cheating and academic dishonesty. Ernest L. Wilkinson expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards. (At this time, Wilkinson, as President of BYU, had some authority over BYU–Hawaii as well.) This led to the Honor Code today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, and drugs (including alcohol). A signed commitment to live the honor code is part of the application process and must be adhered by all students, faculty, and staff. Students and faculty found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council. In rare cases, students and faculty can be expelled from the school or lose tenure. One significant difference between the versions of the Honor Code used at the main BYU campus and BYU–Hawaii is specific prohibition of the drinking of kava by BYU-Hawaii students and faculty. Kava is a traditional Polynesian drink with some drug-like side-effects.

==Alumni==

Alumni of BYU–Hawaii include delegate to Congress from American Samoa Eni Faleomavaega &#x27;64, and Hawaii Rainbow Warriors volleyball coach Mike Wilton &#x27;72.

<text>The American Birkebeiner, or Birkie, is the largest cross-country skiing race in North America. It debuted in 1973 and is a founding member of the Worldloppet federation of cross-country ski marathons. The Birkie&#x27;s two premier events are the skate and the classic races between the towns of Cable and Hayward in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. Each year more than 10,000 skiers participate in the Birkie, including the full-distances races, a Kortelopet race, and a Prince Haakon race.

==History==
The American Birkebeiner, known colloquially as the Birkie, is held annually in February. The event was founded in 1973 by Tony Wise. Wise, who started the Telemark Ski Area in Cable, Wisconsin, in 1947, helped to popularize modern-day cross-country skiing when he built trails at Telemark in 1972. In February 1973, Wise drew on his Norwegian heritage in starting a race named after a famous event in Norway.The Birkie was named after the Birkebeinerrennet race in Norway, which commemorates an important historical event. In 1206 a group of Birkebeiner party soldiers, who fought for Sverre Sigurdsson and his descendants in the Norwegian civil war, smuggled the illegitimate son of Norway&#x27;s King Håkon Sverresson from Lillehammer to safety in Trondheim. In the Norwegian Birkie, classic ski participants still carry packs symbolizing the weight of the young child-prince, Haakon.

==Race description==
Skiers from around the world come to Wisconsin for the race. The Birkie has a reputation for attracting skiers of varying ability levels. Olympians, national team members, and foreign professionals have competed in the event, and the Birkie also draws recreational skiers from Wisconsin, Minnesota, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and countries such as neighboring Canada as well as Norway, Sweden, and other European nations. Typically almost every U.S. state is represented at the Birkie. The race weekend also includes the shorter 29 km (18 mi) Kortelopet &quot;Korte&quot; and Prince Haakon 15 km (9.3 mi) events. The American Birkiebeiner Ski Foundation In 2013, registration was capped at 10,000 skiers, with an additional 20,000 spectators on the sidelines cheering on the competitors.

The Birkie course is quite hilly and is recognized as one of the more difficult cross country ski marathon courses in the world, despite the fact that there are several WorldLoppet events in Europe that are much longer. The current north–south alignment (used since 1992) has skiers traversing a flat section before turning onto the &quot;Powerline Hills&quot;, a series of climbs to the mark. The trail then rolls until , when Firetower Hill takes competitors to , the high point of the race and a climb of nearly from the race start. In the early years of the race, the Birkie began with a climb up the alpine slopes of Mount Telemark, mainly as a publicity stunt, but larger field sizes made this impractical. Beyond High Point is a series of downhills, including &quot;Bobblehead Hill&quot; or &quot;Sledder Hill&quot;, which has a rather tricky downhill, left turn near a snowmobile trail — allowing dozens of snowmobilers to watch and &quot;score&quot; skiers&#x27; falls. The trail rises steeply to the crossing of County Road OO (Referred to as &quot;Double-Oh&quot;) which, at , is the unofficial halfway point of the race. Until 2001, the Kortelopet race ended here but was rerouted back to Telemark after splitting off from the main course at . Since 2017, the Kortelopet is and begins at OO and finishes on Main Street the day before the 50 km race.

Beyond OO the course is less hilly, but by no means flat. After is the aptly named &quot;Bitch Hill&quot; where spectators cheer skiers up the steepest climb of the race. Several kilometers later (just south of Highway 77) the last lengthy ascents of the race---Sunset Hill &amp; Duffy Hill---challenge tired skiers. From the top, Hayward&#x27;s water tower is a most welcome sight. There are several road crossings and open fields before the skiers cross frozen Lake Hayward. The crossing of the lake is flat, but unprotected from wind. Once off the lake, the trail twists through the outskirts of Hayward on snow trucked in for the event. Over the course of hours, thousands of tired and proud skiers make their way past three blocks of cheering spectators lining Hayward&#x27;s Main Street. Warm conditions have occasionally required the finish line to be moved to a flat field just east of the lake.

The race begins with several waves in order to thin skiers out along the course. Alternating skate and classical waves depart every five minutes. New skiers must ski in the last wave unless they use another ski marathon time to qualify for a higher wave. One man—Ernie St. Germaine, a former employee of the Telemark Resort, where the Birkebeiner starts every year—completed every Birkie since the first one in 1973.

The 2021 Birkie was a shortened 43-kilometer race that took place over the course of February 24–28, 2021. The course was modified as well with skiers starting and finishing at the starting line in Cable, WI. The Birkie reverted to its normal Cable to Hayward format for 2022 with the new addition of an &quot;open track&quot; event where participants could ski the race in a more relaxed manner on the Wednesday before the main race with fewer crowds and more open trail.

Despite low snow in 2024, the American Birkiebeiner Ski Foundation created a 10 km (6.2 mi) lapped course. Several races were shortened: The American Birkebeiner was shortened from 50 km (31 mi) to 30 km (18.6 mi), the Kortelopet from 29 km (18 mi) to 20 km (12.4 mi), the Prince Haakon from 15 km (9.3 mi) to 10 km (6.2 mi). The American Birkebeiner Men’s and Women’s Elite Skate race remained a 50K event.

<text>The Neumark (), also known as the New March () or as East Brandenburg (), was a region of the Margraviate of Brandenburg and its successors located east of the Oder River in territory which became part of Poland in 1945 except some villages of former districts of Königsberg in the New March and Weststenberg remained in Germany.

Called the Lubusz Land while part of medieval Poland, the territory later known as the Neumark gradually became part of the German Margraviate of Brandenburg from the mid-13th century. As Brandenburg-Küstrin the Neumark formed an independent state of the Holy Roman Empire from 1535 to 1571; after the death of the margrave John, a younger son of Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg, it returned to Elector John George, the margrave&#x27;s nephew and Joachim I Nestor&#x27;s grandson. With the rest of the Electorate of Brandenburg, it became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701 and part of the German Empire in 1871 when each of those states first formed. After World War I the entirely ethnic German Neumark remained within the Free State of Prussia, itself part of the Weimar Republic (Germany).

After World War II the Potsdam Conference assigned the majority of the Neumark to Polish administration, and since 1945 has remained part of Poland. Polish settlers largely replaced the expelled German population. Most of the Polish territory became part of the Lubusz Voivodeship, while the northern towns Choszczno (Arnswalde), Myślibórz (Soldin), and Chojna (Königsberg in der Neumark) belong to the West Pomeranian Voivodeship. Some territory near Cottbus, which was administratively part of the Government Region of Frankfurt (coterminous with the Neumark) after the 1815 Congress of Vienna, became part of East Germany in the 1940s, becoming part of Germany after reunification in 1990.

== Location ==
The Oder marked the borders of the Neumark in the west and south; in the north it bordered Pomerania, and in the east Greater Poland until the Partitions of Poland in the late 18th century. From the 1772 First Partition of Poland it bordered the Prussian Netze District in the east, which had largely been carved out of the northern part of Greater Poland. After the 1793 Second Partition of Poland the remainder of Greater Poland became part of the Province of South Prussia. In 1807 South Prussia and the southern part of the Netze District (among other areas) became part of the Napoleonic Duchy of Warsaw, while the northern part of the Netze District was merged into the Province of West Prussia; the Neumark shared borders with both.

After 1815 (Congress of Vienna) the Neumark was dissolved, largely becoming part of of the Province of Brandenburg. Most of the eastern border of the Neumark became that of Brandenburg/Frankfurt with West Prussia (Province of Prussia 1829–1878) and the Grand Duchy of Posen (Province of Posen from 1848).

The Warta and Noteć Rivers and their swamp regions dominated the landscape of the region. At the time of the Neumark&#x27;s greatest territorial extent (at the end of the 17th century), the region included the following later (districts) and towns:

=== In the Brandenburgian Region of Frankfurt ===

* (1818–1945; from 1938 part of Pomeranian Region of Posen-West Prussia), based in Neuwedell (till 1908), thereafter in Arnswalde
* (1818–1945), based in Crossen upon Oder
* Friedeberg (1816–1945; from 1938 part of Pomeranian Region of Posen-West Prussia), based in Friedeberg in the New March
* (1816–15 March 1946, remainder west of the Oder merged into , and ), based in Königsberg in the New March 
* (1818–1945), based in Landsberg upon Warthe
* (1818–1945), based in Soldin
* , (1816–1873; partitioned into Oststernberg and ), based in Zielenzig (till 1852), thereafter in Drossen

=== In the Pomeranian Region of Köslin ===

* (1816–1945; from 1938 part of Pomeranian Region of Posen-West Prussia), based in Dramburg
* (1816–1945), based in Schivelbein

== History ==
=== Ancient history ===
In the Bronze Age the area which became the Neumark fell within the area of the Lusatian culture. In the Iron Age the Jastorf culture operated in this region, identified sometimes with Germanic and sometimes with Celtic tribes.

As its inhabitants moved westward, the region became depopulated during the Migration Period. After AD 500 West Slavic tribes gradually repopulated the area, which became a forest borderland between Pomerania and Greater Poland. According to the Bavarian Geographer&#x27;s description, the Miloxi inhabited the future Neumark region: they had 47 settlements between the Oder and Poznań.

=== Middle Ages ===

The region came under the sovereignty of the first Polish state during the 10th-century rule of Mieszko I (died 992) and Bolesław I (ruled 992–1025), Dukes of the Polans. Polish rulers incorporated the future Neumark territory as the Lubusz Land and by the beginning of the 13th century the previously depopulated region had a thinly-spread population of Poles.

Beginning in the 1230s, Low-German–speaking colonists from the Holy Roman Empire began settling north and south of the Warta and Noteć Rivers upon the initiative of Pomeranian and Polish lords (see ). The lords invited members of the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller to establish monasteries, near which settlements began to develop. To fortify the borderland Pomeranian and Polish dukes built castles in the north, around which settlements also grew.

The Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg, starting with Albert the Bear (ruled 1157–1170), aspired to extend their dominion east of the Oder. They had gained a foothold east of the river by 1242 and in 1252 the Margraviate of Brandenburg and the Archbishopric of Magdeburg purchased the Lubusz Land. In 1253 they founded Frankfurt an der Oder as a river-crossing and as a staging-point for further expansion eastward. Through land purchases, marriage pacts, and services to Poland&#x27;s Piast dynasty, the Ascanians extended their territory eastward to the Drawa River and northward to the Parsęta River. For instance, the Polish castellany of Santok, an important base and crossing point over the Warta near its junction with the Noteć, was sought by Pomerania. To relieve himself of the trouble of maintaining the fortress, Duke Przemysł I of Greater Poland granted the castellany to Margrave Conrad as a dowry for his daughter Konstancja. To safeguard the region Margrave John I founded the town of Landsberg an der Warthe (now Gorzów Wielkopolski) in 1257. The Templars sold Soldin to the Ascanians in 1261, and the town began to become a center for the region.

Most of the colonists who settled in Brandenburg&#x27;s new eastern territory came from Magdeburg or the Altmark (&quot;Old March&quot;). Unlike in the rest of Brandenburg (where the Ascanians settled knights in open villages) the margraves began constructing castles in their land east of the Oder to guard against Poland.
The Slavic inhabitants of the region gradually became Germanized. Because the new &quot;Terra trans Oderam&quot;, or &quot;land across the Oder&quot;, formed an extension of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, it became known as the Neumark (&quot;New March&quot;) after the middle of the 15th century.

With the extinction of the Ascanian line in 1320, Brandenburg&#x27;s interest in the Neumark decreased. Neither the margraves of the Wittelsbach (1323–1373) nor those of the Luxembourg dynasties concerned themselves with developing their easternmost territory further. The political vacuum allowed Poland to reassert its influence in the area, while robber barons terrorized the populace.

=== Teutonic Knights ===

Brandenburg pawned the Neumark to the Teutonic Knights in 1402, and it passed completely under their control in 1429, although the Order neglected the region as well. After the Teutonic Knights&#x27; defeat in the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg) in 1410, the future Grand Master Michael Küchmeister von Sternberg used the Neumark as a staging ground for an army of German and Hungarian mercenaries which he later used against the forces of King Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland. This allowed the Order to retain much of its territory in the First Peace of Thorn in 1411.

In 1454/1455 the Knights&#x27; mismanagement led to their pawning of the Neumark back to Brandenburg, by then led by Elector Frederick II of the Hohenzollern dynasty (Treaties of Cölln and Mewe). After Frederick completed the re-acquisition of Neumark in 1463 for 40,000 guilders, the region belonged to Brandenburg for the following centuries, with the exception of the time between 1535 and 1571. Frederick II wrote for his successors &quot;that the said land, the New Mark, shall belong to German territory and to the worshipful Electorate of the Mark of Brandenburg, with which it was incorporated at the institution of the Electorate, and shall so remain, and shall never pass to those who speak not the German tongue&quot;.

=== Brandenburg-Küstrin ===

After the death of Elector Joachim I Nestor in 1535, Brandenburg&#x27;s territory west of the Oder (the Kurmark) went to his older son Joachim II Hector, while the Neumark went to his younger son John, who began ruling the Neumark as an independent margraviate and consolidated the land. An enthusiastic supporter of the Protestant Reformation, John succeeded in converting the Neumark to Lutheranism and in confiscating church property. He lived frugally and acquired wealth for his treasury through usury and hiring out mercenary companies.

The division of Brandenburg resulted in trade wars between the brothers, as Crossen and Landsberg competed with the Kurmark&#x27;s Frankfurt for mercantile primacy. The two margraves eventually compromised – at the economic expense of Stettin. (The brothers also reconciled out of concern for their territories during the Schmalkaldic War of 1546–47.)

In 1548 John&#x27;s administration moved from Soldin to Küstrin. With the death of both brothers within ten days of each other in 1571, the Neumark became reunited with the Kurmark under Joachim II&#x27;s son, John George.

=== Brandenburg-Prussia ===
In 1618, East Brandenburg became part of Brandenburg-Prussia after the electors&#x27; inheritance of the Duchy of Prussia. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) both Swedish and Imperial troops plundered, ravaged and burnt the land, while plague epidemics in 1626 and 1631 killed much of the populace. While occupied by Swedish troops the region had to contribute 60,000 thalers and 10,000 &quot;Wispel&quot; of rye.

=== Kingdom of Prussia ===

After the declaration of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701, the situation in the Neumark began to improve. King Frederick I initiated new waves of colonization. Many French Huguenots, forced to flee from religious persecution in France, arrived as settlers. The textile industry also began to develop in the Neumark. The Seven Years&#x27; War caused the region to regress in its development, as high contributions were exacted from the population for the war effort and the Neumark was the setting for battles such as at Kunersdorf. Under Frederick II, increased land reclamation and economic consolidation resulted from the drainage of the Warta and Notec areas.

The reorganization of Prussia after the territorial changes – resulting from the Congress of Vienna in 1815 – changed the political makeup of the Neumark. The and and the northern part of the with the town of Nörenberg became part of the Province of Pomerania. The Neumark&#x27;s remaining territory was incorporated into the newly created Frankfurt Region of the Province of Brandenburg.

=== Germany ===
With the formation of the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871 the Neumark — along with the rest of Brandenburg — became part of a unified German state. In the Weimar Republic&#x27;s National Assembly of 1 November 1919, the majority of the region voted for the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). The Neumark populace mostly voted for the German National People&#x27;s Party in the elections for the German Reichstag on 20 May 1928, with a small island of SPD voters. In the Reichstag vote of December 1924 1,900 votes were cast for the Polish People&#x27;s Party out of a population of 570,000. In 1925 the Neumark had 3,500 Polish speakers. In the Reichstag vote of 6 November 1932, the Nazi Party won the election in the region.

When the Nazi authorities dissolved the province of Posen-West Prussia in 1938, they expanded the Frankfurt Region to include the districts of Schwerin and of Meseritz, although the New Marcher and of Friedeberg were reassigned to Pomerania. According to the 1939 census, the Neumark had a population of 645,000 residents, including 3,000 non-Germans. The dialect spoken in much of the territory was the East Low German Brandenburgisch dialect.

==== Infrastructure before 1945 ====
The Neumark region long featured agriculture and forestry. The medium-sized towns were mostly &quot;Ackerbürgerstädte&quot;, or farmer-citizen-towns. The textile industry became prominent in the 19th century. With the construction of modern roadways, of the &quot;Fernverkehrstraße 1&quot; (an arterial road from Berlin to Königsberg), and of the Prussian Eastern Railway, the Neumark also began to develop industrially. Such development was primarily geared toward agricultural needs and was concentrated near the cities of Landsberg and Küstrin, and the Neumark did not become nearly as industrialized or densely populated as other German areas such as the Ruhr, Saxony, or Upper Silesia.

==== World War II ====
Near the end of World War II, the Soviet Red Army reached the Neumark at the end of January 1945. Because the Red Army had advanced so quickly, the civilian population of the region suffered greatly from warfare and occupying troops because they had not prepared to flee in time. More than 40,000 New Marchers were killed in action as soldiers.

Under the terms demanded by the Soviet Union in the Potsdam Agreement, the region was put under Polish administration after the Potsdam Conference and eventually became part of Poland. Germans remaining in the region were expelled. Poles, some of whom had themselves been expelled from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union settled the region. A small part of the German population, mostly technicians for the water supply companies, were retained and used for compulsory labour; they were allowed to emigrate to Germany in the 1950s. Older estimates indicated that of the pre-war population of 645,000, only 5,000 of the inhabitants from 1939 remained in the province in 1950.

====Villages in today&#x27;s Germany west of the Oder====
After the regulation of the river Oder in the 18th century the western border of the New March was not adapted to the Oder&#x27;s new partially more eastern course. Thus the New Marcher villages west of the Oder, now the German-Polish border, remained with post-World War II Germany.

Formerly located within the &quot;District of Königsberg in the New March&quot; were the villages , , , , , , , Drewitz Ausbau (a locality of Bleyen), , , Hohenwutzen, , , Königlich Reetz (a locality of Oderaue), Küstrin-Kietz, , Neuküstrinchen (a locality of Oderaue), , Neuranft, Neurüdnitz, , , Schaumburg in the Oderbruch (a locality of Bleyen), , and Zelliner Loose (a locality of Letschin). The villages of and Kunitz-Loose (a locality of Wiesenau) formed part of the Weststernberg district.

=== Poland ===
The Oder-Neisse line delimiting Germany and Poland split several localities of the region into divided cities:

* Küstrin was separated into German Küstrin-Kietz and Polish Kostrzyn nad Odrą,
* Frankfurt an der Oder was split into German Frankfurt (Oder) and Polish Słubice,
* Guben was divided into German Guben and Polish Gubin,
* Bad Muskau was split into German Bad Muskau and Polish Łęknica,
* Forst was divided into German Forst and Polish Zasieki,
* Görlitz was separated into German Görlitz and Polish Zgorzelec.

To replace the expelled indigenous German population, Soviet authorities re-settled Neumark with Poles and Ukrainians from territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. From 1975 to 1998 the former Neumark territory was divided between the Voivodeships of Gorzów and Zielona Góra with a small section around Chojna in Szczecin Voivodeship. Since the reorganization of Polish voivodeships on 1 January 1999, almost all of the former Neumark region lies within the Lubusz Voivodeship.

==== Modern inhabitants ====
During the Polish post-war census of December 1950, data about the pre-war places of residence of the inhabitants as of August 1939 was collected. In case of children born between September 1939 and December 1950, their origin was reported based on the pre-war places of residence of their mothers. Thanks to this data it is possible to reconstruct the pre-war geographical origin of the post-war population. The same area corresponding to 1939 East Brandenburg east of the Oder-Neisse line (which became part of Poland in 1945) was inhabited as of December 1950 by:

Over 95% of the 1950 population were newcomers to the region, with less than 5% residing in German East Brandenburg already back in August 1939 (so called autochthons, who had German citizenship before World War II and were granted Polish citizenship after 1945). The largest group among new inhabitants were Poles expelled from areas of Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. The second largest group were people from neighbouring pre-war Poznań Voivodeship of Poland (historical Greater Poland region), comprising one-fifth of post-war inhabitants.
