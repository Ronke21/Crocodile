<text>Student activism or campus activism is work by students to cause political, environmental, economic, or social change. In addition to education, student groups often play central roles in democratization and winning civil rights.

Modern student activist movements span all ages, races, socio-economic backgrounds, and political perspectives. Some student protests focus on the internal affairs of an institution (like disinvestment); others tackle wars or dictatorships. Student activism is most often associated with left-wing politics.

== Early examples ==
Student activism at the university level is nearly as old as the university itself. 

Students in Paris and Bologna staged collective actions as early as the 13th century, chiefly over town and gown issues. 

Student protests over broader political issues also have a long pedigree. In Joseon Dynasty Korea, 150 Sungkyunkwan students staged an unprecedented demonstration against the king in 1519 over the Kimyo purge.

==By country==

===Argentina===

In Argentina, as elsewhere in Latin America, the tradition of student activism dates back to at least the 19th century, but it was not until after 1900 that it became a major political force. In 1918 student activism triggered a general modernization of the universities especially tending towards democratization, called the University Revolution (Spanish: &quot;revolución universitaria&quot;). The events started in Córdoba and were accompanied by similar uprisings across Latin America.

===Australia===

Australian students have a long history of being active in political debates. This is particularly true in the newer universities that have been established in suburban areas.

For much of the 20th century, the major campus organizing group across Australia was the Australian Union of Students, which was founded in 1937 as the Union of Australian University Students. The AUS folded in 1984. It was replaced by the National Union of Students in 1987.

===Bangladesh===
Student politics of Bangladesh is reactive, confrontational and violent. Student organizations act as the armament of the political parties they are part of. Over the years, political clashes and factional feuds in the educational institutes killed many, seriously hampering the academic atmosphere. To check those hitches, universities have no options but go to lengthy and unexpected closures. Therefore, classes are not completed on time and there are session jams.

The student wings of ruling parties dominate the campuses and residential halls through crime and violence to enjoy various unauthorized facilities. They control the residential halls to manage seats in favor of their party members and loyal pupils. They eat and buy for free from the restaurants and shops nearby. They extort and grab tenders to earn illicit money. They take money from the freshmen candidates and put pressure on teachers to get an acceptance for them. They take money from the job seekers and put pressures on university administrations to appoint them.

=== Brazil ===
On August 11, 1937, the União Nacional dos Estudantes (UNE) was formed as a platform for students to create change in Brazil. The organization tried to unite students from all over Brazil. However, in the 1940s the group had aligned more with socialism. Then in the 1950s the group changed alignment again, this time aligning with more conservative values. The União Metropolitana dos Estudantes rose up in replacement of the once socialist UNE. However, it was not long until União Nacional dos Estudantes once again sided with socialism, thus joining forces with the União Metropolitana dos Estudantes.

The União Nacional dos Estudantes was influential in the democratization of higher education. Their first significant feat occurred during World War II when they successfully pressured Brazilian president Getúlio Vargas to join the side of the Allies.

In 1964, UNE was outlawed after elected leader João Goulart was disposed of power by a military coup. The military regime terrorized students in an effort to make them subservient. In 1966, students began protesting anyway despite the reality of further terror.

All the protests led up to the March of the One Hundred Thousand in June 1968. Organized by the UNE, this protest was the largest yet. A few months later the government passed Institutional Act Number Five which officially banned students from any further protest.

===Canada===

In Canada, New Left student organizations from the late 1950s and 1960s became mainly two: SUPA (Student Union for Peace Action) and CYC (Company of Young Canadians). SUPA grew out of the CUCND (Combined Universities Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament) in December 1964, at a University of Saskatchewan conference. While CUCND had focused on protest marches, SUPA sought to change Canadian society as a whole. The scope expanded to grass-roots politics in disadvantaged communities and &#x27;consciousness raising&#x27; to radicalize and raise awareness of the &#x27;generation gap&#x27; experienced by Canadian youth. SUPA was a decentralized organization, rooted in local university campuses. SUPA however disintegrated in late 1967 over debates concerning the role of working class and &#x27;Old Left&#x27;. Members moved to the CYC or became active leaders in CUS (Canadian Union of Students), leading the CUS to assume the mantle of New Left student agitation.

In 1968, SDU (Students for a Democratic University) was formed at McGill and Simon Fraser Universities. SFU SDU, originally former SUPA members and New Democratic Youth, absorbed members from the campus Liberal Club and Young Socialists. SDU was prominent in an Administration occupation in 1968, and a student strike in 1969. After the failure of the student strike, SDU broke up. Some members joined the IWW and Yippies (Youth International Party). Other members helped form the Vancouver Liberation Front in 1970. The FLQ (Quebec Liberation Front) was considered a terrorist organization, causing the use of the War Measures Act after 95 bombings in the October Crisis. This was the only peacetime use of the War Measures Act.

Since the 1970s, PIRGs (Public Interest Research Groups) have been created as a result of Student Union referendums across Canada in individual provinces. Like their American counterparts, Canadian PIRGs are student directed, run, and funded. Most operate on a consensus decision making model. Despite efforts at collaboration, Canadian PIRGs are independent of each other.

Anti-Bullying Day (a.k.a. Pink Shirt Day) was created by high school students David Shepherd, and Travis Price of Berwick, Nova Scotia, and is now celebrated annually across Canada.

In 2012, the Quebec Student Movement arose due to an increase of tuition of 75%; that took students out of class and into the streets because that increase did not allow students to comfortably extend their education, because of fear of debt or not having money at all. Following elections that year, premier Jean Charest promised to repeal anti-assembly laws and cancel the tuition hike.

Canadian universities have been active sites for debate and mobilization, with student groups advocating on both sides of the conflict. This activism has led to significant polarization on campuses, with heated debates, protests, and resolutions at institutions like McGill University and York University. The discussions often involve broader issues of academic freedom and concerns over rising antisemitism and Islamophobia. As the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains unresolved, it continues to be a key issue driving student activism in Canada. 

===Chile===
From 2011 to 2013, Chile was rocked by a series of student-led nationwide protests across Chile, demanding a new framework for education in the country, including more direct state participation in secondary education and an end to the existence of profit in higher education. Currently in Chile, only 45% of high school students study in traditional public schools and most universities are also private. No new public universities have been built since the end of the Chilean transition to democracy in 1990, even though the number of university students has swelled. Beyond the specific demands regarding education, the protests reflected a &quot;deep discontent&quot; among some parts of society with Chile&#x27;s high level of inequality. Protests have included massive non-violent marches, but also a considerable amount of violence on the part of a side of protestors as well as riot police.

The first clear government response to the protests was a proposal for a new education fund and a cabinet shuffle which replaced Minister of Education Joaquín Lavín and was seen as not fundamentally addressing student movement concerns. Other government proposals were also rejected.

===China===
Since the defeat of the Qing Dynasty during the First (1839–1842) and Second Opium Wars (1856–1860), student activism has played a significant role in the modern Chinese history. 

Fueled mostly by Chinese nationalism, Chinese student activism strongly believes that young people are responsible for China&#x27;s future. This strong nationalistic belief has been able to manifest in several forms such as pro-democracy, anti-Americanism and pro-communism.

In 1919, the May Fourth Movement saw over 3,000 students of Peking University and other schools gather together in front of Tiananmen and demonstrate. It is regarded as an essential step of the democratic revolution in China, and it had also given birth to Chinese Communism. 

During the 1927–1937 Nanjing decade, student activism played an outsized role.

While nationalist Anti-American movements led by some students and intellectuals during the Chinese Civil War were instrumental in winning enough support for the CCP in urban areas to prevail, there remained lots of polarization on campuses in the late 1940&#x27;s with a wide range of views. Ironically, America&#x27;s influence in post-war China, designed to prevent Soviet influence appears to have backfired for the United States as some Chinese students were sensitive to any overt foreign influence after the Japanese occupation. 

In 1989, the Tiananmen Square protests, led by students, inspired ended in a brutal government massacre of thousands, damaging the reputation of the Chinese Communist Party as it moved towards a more repressive approach to speech and dissent.

=== Czech Republic ===
Jan Palach and Jan Zajíc&#x27;s protests against the end of the Prague Spring used self-immolation.

=== Democratic Republic of the Congo ===
Student activism played an important, yet understudied, role in Congo&#x27;s crisis of decolonisation. Throughout the 1960s, students denounced the unfinished decolonisation of higher education and the unrealised promises of national independence. The two issues crossed in the demonstration of June 4, 1969. Student activism continues and women such as Aline Mukovi Neema, winner of 100 Women BBC award, continue to campaign for political change in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

===Eastern Europe and the post-Soviet Union states===

During communist rule, students in Eastern Europe were the force behind several of the best-known instances of protest. The chain of events leading to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution was started by peaceful student demonstrations in the streets of Budapest, later attracting workers and other Hungarians. In Czechoslovakia, one of the most known faces of the protests following the Soviet-led invasion that ended the Prague Spring was Jan Palach, a student who committed suicide by setting fire to himself on January 16, 1969. The act triggered a major protest against the occupation.

Student-dominated youth movements have also played a central role in the &quot;color revolutions&quot; seen in post-communist societies in recent years.

Of the color revolutions, the Velvet Revolution of 1989 in the Czechoslovak capital of Prague was one of them. Though the Velvet Revolution began as a celebration of International Students&#x27; Day, the single event quickly turned into a nationwide ordeal aimed at the dissolution of communism. The demonstration had turned violent when police intervened. However, the police attacks garnered nationwide sympathy for the student protesters. Soon enough multiple other protests unraveled in an effort to breakdown the one party communist regime of Czechoslovakia. The series of protests were successful; they broke down the communist regime and implemented the use of democratic elections in 1990, only a few months after the first protest.

Another example of this was the Serbian Otpor! (&quot;Resistance!&quot; in Serbian), formed in October 1998 as a response to repressive university and media laws that were introduced that year. In the presidential campaign in September 2000, the organisation engineered the &quot;Gotov je&quot; (&quot;He&#x27;s finished&quot;) campaign that galvanized Serbian discontent with Slobodan Milošević, ultimately resulting in his defeat.

Otpor has inspired other youth movements in Eastern Europe, such as Kmara in Georgia, which played an important role in the Rose Revolution, and PORA in Ukraine, which was key in organising the demonstrations that led to the Orange Revolution. Like Otpor, these organisations have consequently practiced non-violent resistance and used ridiculing humor in opposing authoritarian leaders. Similar movements include KelKel in Kyrgyzstan, Zubr in Belarus and MJAFT! in Albania.

===Ethiopia===
Student movements in Ethiopia in the late 1960s, during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie, included debates about the social sciences and social change and played a significant role in political opposition to Haile Selassie, which led to the 1974 Ethiopian Revolution. Student activism played a role in both socially progressive aspects of the revolution and in human rights violations. Student activism and their use of the social sciences played a role in the 1991 fall of the following government, the Derg, and in the implementation of the rule of Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front during the following three decades.

===France===

In France, student activists have been influential in shaping public debate. In May 1968 the University of Paris at Nanterre was closed due to problems between the students and the administration. In protest of the closure and the expulsion of Nanterre students, students of the Sorbonne in Paris began their own demonstration. The situation escalated into a nationwide insurrection.

The events in Paris were followed by student protests throughout the world. The German student movement participated in major demonstrations against proposed emergency legislation. In many countries, the student protests caused authorities to respond with violence. In Spain, student demonstrations against Franco&#x27;s dictatorship led to clashes with police. A student demonstration in Mexico City ended in a storm of bullets on the night of October 2, 1968, an event known as the Tlatelolco massacre. Even in Pakistan, students took to the streets to protest changes in education policy, and on November 7 two college students died after police opened fire on a demonstration. The global reverberations from the French uprising of 1968 continued into 1969 and even into the 1970s.

===Germany===
In 1815 in Jena (Germany) the &quot;Urburschenschaft&quot; was founded. That was a Studentenverbindung that was concentrated on national and democratic ideas.
In 1817, inspired by liberal and patriotic ideas of a united Germany, student organisations gathered for the Wartburg festival at Wartburg Castle, at Eisenach in Thuringia, on the 300th anniversary of Martin Luther&#x27;s 95 theses.

In May 1832 the Hambacher Fest was celebrated at Hambach Castle near Neustadt an der Weinstraße with about 30,000 participants, amongst them many students. Together with the Frankfurter Wachensturm in 1833 planned to free students held in prison at Frankfurt and Georg Büchner&#x27;s revolutionary pamphlet &quot;Der Hessische Landbote&quot; that were events that led to the revolutions in the German states in 1848.

The White Rose society in Nazi Germany lasted from 1942–1943, during which students mailed anti-nazi leaflets around the country until the leaders were caught and executed.

In the 1960s, the worldwide upswing in student and youth radicalism manifested itself through the German student movement and organisations such as the German Socialist Student Union. The movement in Germany shared many concerns of similar groups elsewhere, such as the democratisation of society and opposing the Vietnam War, but also stressed more nationally specific issues such as coming to terms with the legacy of the Nazi regime and opposing the German Emergency Acts.

===Greece===
Student activism in Greece has a long and intense history. Student activism in the 1960s was one of the reasons cited to justify the imposition of the dictatorship in 1967. Following the imposition of the dictatorship, the Athens Polytechnic uprising in 1973 triggered a series of events that led to the abrupt end of the regime&#x27;s attempted &quot;liberalisation&quot; process under Spiros Markezinis, and, after that, to the eventual collapse of the Greek junta during Metapolitefsi and the return of democracy in Greece. Kostas Georgakis was a Greek student of geology, who, in the early hours of 19 September 1970, set himself ablaze in Matteotti square in Genoa as a protest against the dictatorial regime of Georgios Papadopoulos. His suicide greatly embarrassed the junta, and caused a sensation in Greece and abroad as it was the first tangible manifestation of the depth of resistance against the junta. The junta delayed the arrival of his remains to Corfu for four months citing security reasons and fearing demonstrations while presenting bureaucratic obstacles through the Greek consulate and the junta government.

=== Hong Kong (SAR of China)===
Hong Kong Student activist group Scholarism began an occupation of the Hong Kong government headquarters on 30 August 2012. The goal of the protest was, expressly, to force the government to retract its plans to introduce Moral and National Education as a compulsory subject. On 1 September, an open concert was held as part of the protest, with an attendance of 40,000. At last, the government de facto struck down the Moral and National Education.

Student organizations made important roles during the Umbrella Movement. Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPCSC) made decisions on the Hong Kong political reform on 31 August 2014, which the Nominating Committee would tightly control the nomination of the Chief Executive candidate, candidates outside the Pro-Beijing camp would not have opportunities to be nominated. The Hong Kong Federation of Students and Scholarism led a strike against the NPCSC&#x27;s decision beginning on 22 September 2014, and started protesting outside the government headquarters on 26 September 2014. On 28 September, the Occupy Central with Love and Peace movement announced that the beginning of their civil disobedience campaign. Students and other members of the public demonstrated outside government headquarters, and some began to occupy several major city intersections.

=== India ===
The Assam Movement (or Assam Agitation) (1979–1985) was a popular movement against illegal immigrants in Assam. The movement, led by All Assam Students Union (AASU) and the &#x27;All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad&#x27; (AAGSP), developed a program of protests and demonstration to compel the Indian government to identify and expel illegal, (mostly Bangladeshi), immigrants and protect and provide constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards to the indigenous Assamese people.
The Jadavpur University of Kolkata have played an important role to contribute to the student activism of India. The Hokkolorob Movement (2014) stirred many around the world. It took place after the alleged police attack over unarmed students inside the campus demanding the fair justice of a student who was molested inside the campus. The Movement finally led to the expulsion of the contemporary Vice Chancellor of the university, Mr. Abhijit Chakraborty, who allegedly ordered the police to do open lathicharge over the students. Some anti-social goons were also involved in the harassment of the students.

===Indonesia===

Indonesia is often believed to have hosted &quot;some of the most important acts of student resistance in the world&#x27;s history&quot;. University student groups have repeatedly been the first groups to stage street demonstrations calling for governmental change at key points in the nation&#x27;s history, and other organizations from across the political spectrum have sought to align themselves with student groups. In 1928, the Youth Pledge (Sumpah Pemuda) helped to give voice to anti-colonial sentiments.

During the political turmoil of the 1960s, right-wing student groups staged demonstrations calling for then-President Sukarno to eliminate alleged Communists from his government, and later demanding that he resign. Sukarno did step down in 1967, and was replaced by Army general Suharto.

Student groups also played a key role in Suharto&#x27;s 1998 fall by initiating large demonstrations that gave voice to widespread popular discontent with the president in the aftermath of the May 1998 riots. High school and university students in Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Medan, and elsewhere were some of the first groups willing to speak out publicly against the military government. Student groups were a key part of the political scene during this period. Upon taking office after Suharto stepped down, B. J. Habibie made numerous mostly unsuccessful overtures to placate the student groups that had brought down his predecessor. When that failed, he sent a combined force of police and gangsters to evict protesters occupying a government building by force. The ensuing carnage left two students dead and 181 injured.

===Iran===

In Iran, students were at the forefront of protests both against the pre-1979 secular monarchy and, in the 2000s and 2010s, against the theocratic islamic republic. Both religious and more moderate students played a major part in Ruhollah Khomeini&#x27;s opposition network against the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In January 1978 the army dispersed demonstrating students and religious leaders, killing several students and sparking a series of widespread protests that ultimately led to the Iranian Revolution the following year. On November 4, 1979, militant Iranian students calling themselves the Muslim Students Following the Line of the Imam seized the US embassy in Tehran holding 52 embassy employees hostage for a 444 days (see Iran hostage crisis).

In the July 1999 Iranian student riots, liberal students clashed with the Iranian government. Several people were killed in a week of violent confrontations that started with a police raid on a university dormitory, a response to demonstrations by a group of students of Tehran University against the closure of a reformist newspaper. Akbar Mohammadi was given a death sentence, later reduced to 15 years in prison, for his role in the protests. In 2006, he died at Evin prison after a hunger strike protesting the refusal to allow him to seek medical treatment for injuries suffered as a result of torture.

At the end of 2002, students held mass demonstrations protesting the death sentence of reformist lecturer Hashem Aghajari for alleged blasphemy. 

In June 2003, several thousand students took to the streets of Tehran in anti-government protests sparked by government plans to privatise some universities.

In the May 2005 Iranian presidential election, Iran&#x27;s largest student organization, The Office to Consolidate Unity, advocated a voting boycott. After the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, student protests against the government has continued. In May 2006, up to 40 police officers were injured in clashes with demonstrating students in Tehran. At the same time, the Iranian government has called for student action in line with its own political agenda. In 2006, President Ahmadinejad urged students to organize campaigns to demand that liberal and secular university teachers be removed.

In 2009, after the disputed presidential election, a series of student protests broke out, which became known as the Iranian Green Movement. The violent measures used by the Iranian government to suppress these protests have been the subject of widespread international condemnation. As a consequence of hash repression, &quot;the student movement entered a period of silence during Ahmadinejad&#x27;s second term (2009–2013)&quot;.

During the first term of Hassan Rouhani in office (2013-2017) several groups endeavored to revive the student movement through rebuilding student organizations.

After Mahsa Amini died on September 16, 2022, massive nationwide protests erupted throughout Iran, with schoolgirls playing a historically central role.

===Israel===
In Israel the students were amongst the leading figures in the 2011 Israeli social justice protests that grew out of the Cottage cheese boycott.

===Japan===

Japanese student movement began during the Taishō Democracy, and grew in activity after World War II. One such event was the Anpo Protests, which occurred in 1960, in opposition to the Anpo treaty. In the subsequent student uprising in 1968, leftist activists barricaded themselves in universities, resulting in armed conflict with the Japanese police force. Some wider causes were supported including opposition to the Vietnam War and apartheid, and for the acceptance of the hippie lifestyle.

===Malaysia===
Since the amendment of Section 15 of the Universities and University Colleges Act 1971 (UUCA) in 1975, students were barred from being members of, and expressing support or opposition to, any political parties or &quot;any organization, body or group of persons which the Minister, after consultation with the Board, has specified in writing to the Vice-Chancellor to be unsuitable to the interests and well-being of the students or the University.&quot; However, in October 2011, the Court of Appeal ruled that the relevant provision in Section 15 UUCA was unconstitutional due to Article 10 of the Federal Constitution pertaining to freedom of expression.

Since the act prohibiting students from expressing &quot;support, sympathy or opposition&quot; to any political party was enacted in 1971, Malaysian students have repeatedly demanded that the ban on political involvement be rescinded. The majority of students are not interested in politics because they are afraid that the universities will take action against them. The UUCA (also known by its Malaysian acronym AUKU) not however been entirely successful in eliminating student activism and political engagement.

In Kuala Lumpur on 14 April 2012, student activists camped out at Independence Square and marched against a government loan program that they said charged students high interest rates and left them with debt.

The largest student movement in Malaysia is the Solidariti Mahasiswa Malaysia (SMM; Student Solidarity of Malaysia). This is a coalition group that represents numerous student organizations. Currently, SMM is actively campaigning against the UUCA and a free education at primary, secondary and tertiary level.

===Mexico===

During the protests of 1968, Mexican military and police killed an estimated 30 to 300 students and civilian protesters. This killing is known as in the Tlatelolco massacre, and took place on October 2, 1968, in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in the Tlatelolco section of Mexico City. The events are considered part of the Mexican Dirty War, when the government used its forces to suppress political opposition. The massacre occurred 10 days before the opening of the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.
More recent student movements include Yo Soy 132 in 2012. Yo Soy 132 was a social movement composed for the most part of Mexican university students from private and public universities, residents of Mexico, claiming supporters from about 50 cities around the world. It began as opposition to the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate Enrique Peña Nieto and the Mexican media&#x27;s allegedly biased coverage of the 2012 general election. The name Yo Soy 132, Spanish for &quot;I Am 132&quot;, originated in an expression of solidarity with the original 131 protest&#x27;s initiators. The phrase drew inspiration from the Occupy movement and the Spanish 15-M movement. The protest movement was self-proclaimed as the &quot;Mexican spring&quot; (an allusion to the Arab Spring) by its first spokespersons, and called the &quot;Mexican occupy movement&quot; in the international press.

Following the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping, students responded nationally in protest from marches to destruction of property. Through social media, hashtags such as #TodosSomosAyotzinapa spread and prompted global student response.

=== Norway ===
Similar to the students of Sweden, many student activists have emerged in Norway to protest climate change. While Norway is commonly viewed as a model country when it comes to combating climate change, students in Norway say there&#x27;s more to be done. Though the country has put forth many internal climate combating initiatives, students worry over the country&#x27;s exportation of oil and gas.

=== Pakistan ===
Historically throughout Pakistan, university students have led protests against dictatorships and militant regimes. In the 1960s, the National Student Federation and the Peoples student federation worked together to protest against their current militant regime. That regime was run by General Ayub Khan, the second president of Pakistan.

In 2012, Malala Yousafzai was shot by the Taliban when standing up for the right of girls in Pakistan to receive an education. Surviving the attack, Yousafzai continued on as an activist for women&#x27;s education. She has since written two books stressing the importance of girl&#x27;s education not only in her home of Pakistan, but also around the world. Her first book, &quot;I Am Malala&quot;, details her own experience; while her second book, &quot;We Are Displaced&quot;, details the lives of girls she met from refugee camps. In 2014, she became the youngest person to receive a Nobel Peace Prize. She was 17 years of age upon accepting the award.

===Philippines===
Student activism in the Philippines saw a surge during the Ferdinand Marcos regime in the late 1960s and early 1970s during the First Quarter Storm before the declaration of Martial Law. Until today, student activism continues for various causes such as for free education, corruption within the government, and extrajudicial killings. Some groups that lead these protests are the League of Filipino Students (LFS), National Union of Students of the Philippines (NUSP), Anakbayan, and Kabataan Party-List.
===Russia===
, , and have all had extensive student activist movements.

=== South Africa ===
In the 1970s, students in South Africa contributed to the movement against the apartheid. On June 16, 1976, students congregated in what would come to be known at the Soweto Uprising. Here, they led a peaceful protest in response to the Bantu Education Act of 1953. In an attempt to break apart the protest, police met the students with violence and force. The violence that ensued during the uprising led many to sympathize with the protesting students. The exposed nature of the apartheid caused an international abhorrence leading to its deconstruction.

===South Korea===
=== Sweden ===
In 2018, Greta Thunberg caught international attention when she began missing classes to protest climate change. What began as sitting outside Sweden&#x27;s parliament with fliers in hand, quickly became an international student movement. On March 15, 2019, students from more than 130 countries skipped school for the global climate strike.

=== Taiwan ===
The Sunflower Student Movement in 2014 advocated for independence from China and some of its leaders went on to form the pro-democracy New Power Party in 2015.

The Anti Black Box Movement in 2015 challenged opaque education reforms and reformers.

=== Thailand ===
The overthrow of Thai leader Field Marshall Thanom Kittikachorn was primarily led by students. Called the October 14, 1973 Uprising, students were successful in overthrowing his military dictatorship and restoring democracy. In addition to Thanom, they also overthrew deputy Field Marshall Praphas Charusathien. After Thanom was overthrown he was forced into exile, but in 1976 returned to become a monk. Although he swore to stay out of politics, the presence of him caused student protests to begin again. On October 6, 1976, many protestors died at the hands of right-wing militants that had torn through Thammasat University.

Left-wing students are now known to protest any Thanom-styled regime.

Students played a very important role in the ongoing 2020 Thai protests. Students from many parts of Thailand are participating in a series of pro-democracy movements against Thai government under Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha. One instance saw a debate between students and Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan who used to be a part of the anti-democratic People&#x27;s Democratic Reform Committee that called for Prayuth to staged 2014 Thai coup d&#x27;état.

=== Uganda ===
Uganda has the second youngest population in the world, with rising numbers of university students seeking improved employment opportunities. Over the last 100 years since the establishment of the first Ugandan university, these students have been especially politically engaged. The structure of the university government system encourages political action, as student leadership positions are viewed as extensions of government elections and parties. During British colonialism and independence, students have played a crucial role in protesting government leadership with varied success.

===Ukraine===
===United Kingdom===

Student political activism has existed in U.K since the 1880s with the formation of the student representative councils, precursors of union organisations designed to present students interests. These later evolved into unions, many of which became part of the National Union of Students (NUS) formed in 1921. However, the NUS was designed to be specifically outside of &quot;political and religious interests&quot;, reducing its importance as a centre for student activism. During the 1930s students began to become more politically involved with the formation of many socialist societies at universities, ranging from social democratic to Marxist–Leninist and Trotskyist, even leading to Brian Simon, a communist, becoming head of the NUS.

However, it was not until the 1960s that student activism became important in British universities. The Vietnam war and issues of racism initiated a focus on other local frustrations, such as fees and student representation. In 1962, the first student protest against the Vietnam War was held, with CND. However, student activism did not begin on a large scale until the mid-1960s. In 1965, a student protest of 250 students was held outside Edinburgh&#x27;s American embassy and the beginning of protests against the Vietnam war in Grovesnor square. It also saw the first major teach-in in Britain in 1965, where students debated the Vietnam War and alternative non-violent means of protest at the London School of Economics, sponsored by the Oxford Union.

In 1966 the Radical Student Alliance and Vietnam Solidarity Campaign were formed, both of which became centres for the protest movement. However, the first student sit-in was held at the London School of Economics in 1967 by their Students&#x27; union over the suspension of two students. Its success and a national student rally of 100,000 held in the same year is usually considered to mark the start of the movement. Up until the mid-1970s student activities were held including a protest of up to 80,000 strong in Grosvenor Square, anti-racist protests and occupations in Newcastle, the breaking down of riot control gates and forced closure of the London School of Economics, and Jack Straw becoming the head of the NUS for the RSA. However, many protests were over more local issues, such as student representation in college governance, better accommodation, lower fees or even canteen prices.

Student protests erupted again in 2010 during the Premiership of David Cameron over the issue of tuition fees, higher education funding cuts and withdrawal of the Education Maintenance Allowance.

During the wave of School Strikes for Climate in 2019, student strikes saw up to 300,000 school children on the streets in the UK, at protests organised by a network of local groups of youth climate activists. Umbrella campaign groups such as Scottish Youth Climate Strike in Scotland, Youth Climate Association Northern Ireland in Northern Ireland, and UK Student Climate Network in England and Wales, made demands to respective governments and local authorities on the back of these protests and achieved some successes, and continue to campaign for climate justice.

In May 2024, a group of student activists at the University of Edinburgh pitched tents in the Old College Quad to protest against what they alleged was the university&#x27;s failure to divest itself of investments deemed proxy support for the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip. Eight of the protesters launched a hunger strike.

===United States===

In the United States, student activism is often understood as a form of youth activism that has been most notable in its role in nonviolent protests regarding civil rights. 

Some of the first well documented, directed activism occurred on the campuses of Black institutions like Fisk and Howard in the 1920s. At Fisk, students&#x27; concerns surrounding disciplinary rules designed to undermine black identity coalesced into demands for the resignation of President Fayette Avery McKenzie. Spurred by alum W.E.B. Du Bois&#x27; 1924 commencement speech, the students ignored the 10 p.m. curfew to protest, and staged subsequent walkouts. After a committee found Mckenzie&#x27;s abilities and handling of the unrest poor, he resigned on April 16, 1925. Events at Fisk had wide repercussions, as black students elsewhere began to question the repressive status quo of the postwar black university.

In the 1930s, the American Youth Congress lobbied the US Congress against war and racial discrimination and for youth programs. It was heavily supported by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.

Perhaps the most notable and accomplished student groups in US History were the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Atlanta Student Movement, predominantly African American groups that won passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

The Free Speech Movement in 1964–65 at UC Berkeley used mass civil disobedience to overturn restrictions on on-campus political activities. The Free Speech Movement was the first US student movement that became a focus of scholarly attention into student activism.

The largest student strike in American history took place in May and June 1970, in response to the Kent State shootings and the American invasion of Cambodia. Over four million students participated in this action.

The Disinvestment from South Africa movement involved many universities, starting with the University of California, Berkeley, where student activism helped it to become the first institution to disinvest completely from companies implicated in and profiting from apartheid.

In the 1990s, the popular education reform movement has led to a resurgence of populist student activism against standardized testing and teaching, as well as more complex issues including military/industrial/prison complex and the influence of the military and corporations in education. 

Major contemporary campaigns include work for funding of public schools, against increased tuitions at colleges or the use of sweatshop labor in manufacturing school apparel (e.g. United Students Against Sweatshops), for increased student voice throughout education planning, delivery, and policy-making (e.g. The Roosevelt Institution), and to raise national and local awareness of the humanitarian consequences of the Darfur Conflict. Antiwar activism has also increased leading to the creation of the Campus Antiwar Network and the refounding of SDS in 2006.

In February 2018 after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, many students began to organise rallies and protests against gun violence. A huge series of protests including the March for Our Lives (MFOL) followed, drawing millions of protesters and notably attacking the NRA as well as US gun laws. A number of student activists such as X González who helped lead the protests quickly garnered media attention for their action. Later, these students created MFOL, a non-profit 501(c)(4) organization. A number of other students have followed their lead and created other youth organizations, including Team Enough, which is being overseen by the Brady Campaign, and Students Demand Action, which is being overseen by Everytown for Gun Safety.

Recent youth activism around youth voter turnout includes efforts like EighteenX18, an organization started by actress Yara Shahidi of ABC&#x27;s Blacki-sh devoted to increased voter turnout in youth; OneMillionOfUs, a national youth voting and advocacy organization working to educate and empower 1 million young people to vote which started by Jerome Foster II. 

Climate change has also been an issue for youth activists in the United States, including This is Zero Hour, an environmentally-focused youth organization started by Jamie Margolin.

Marchand died in office on September 25, 1900, and Parent succeeded him. He won the 1900 election and the 1904 election and resigned in 1905 when 44 Liberal MLAs, led by Lomer Gouin, Adélard Turgeon and William Alexander Weir, pressured him to resign.

Parent also served as mayor of Quebec City from 1894 to 1906.

<doc id="516801" wikidata="Q6182811" url="?curid=516801" title="Jerome Lawrence">
<text>Jerome Lawrence (born Jerome Lawrence Schwartz; July 14, 1915 – February 29, 2004) was an American playwright and author. After graduating from the Ohio State University in 1937 and the University of California, Los Angeles in 1939, Lawrence partnered with Robert Edwin Lee to help create Armed Forces Radio while serving together in the U.S. Army during World War II. The two built a partnership over their lifetimes, and continued to collaborate on screenplays and musicals until Lee&#x27;s death in 1994.

Lawrence and Lee won acclaim for the 1955 play &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, based on the Scopes trial. Lawrence describes their plays as &quot;shar[ing] the theme of the dignity of every individual mind, and that mind&#x27;s life-long battle against limitation and censorship&quot;. The two deliberately avoided Broadway later in their careers and formed the American Playwrights Theater in 1963 to help promote their plays. After Lee&#x27;s death, Lawrence continued to write plays in his Malibu, California, home. He died in Malibu on February 29, 2004, from complications of a stroke.

==Life and career==
Jerome Lawrence Schwartz was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on July 14, 1915. Lawrence&#x27;s father, Samuel Schwartz, operated a printing press, while his mother Sarah (née Rogen) wrote poetry and did volunteer work. After he graduated from Glenville High School in 1933, Lawrence attended the Ohio State University, where he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1937. While a student at Ohio State, Lawrence was initiated into the Nu chapter of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity, a historically Jewish social fraternity. Two years later, he completed graduate studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Lawrence worked for several small newspapers as a reporter/editor before moving into radio as a writer for CBS. In 1941, Lawrence co-created with Aleen Leslie the radio series &quot;A Date with Judy&quot;, which was based on Leslie&#x27;s “One Girl Chorus” column in the Pittsburgh Press. Lawrence left the show in 1943.

With his writing partner, Robert E. Lee, Lawrence worked for Armed Forces Radio while serving together in the U.S. Army during World War II. Lawrence and Lee became the most prolific writing partnership in radio, with such long-running series as &quot;Favorite Story&quot;, among others.

Lawrence and Lee turned to the live theatre in 1955 with &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, which remains among the most-produced plays in the American theatre. They also collaborated on the plays &quot;Auntie Mame&quot;, &quot;The Incomparable Max&quot;, and &quot;First Monday in October&quot;, among others. In 1965, they founded the American Playwrights&#x27; Theatre, a plan to bypass the commerciality of the Broadway stage, which foreshadowed the professional regional theatre movement. Their wildly successful play, &quot;The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail&quot;, was produced through the American Playwrights Theatre, and premiered at Lawrence&#x27;s alma mater, Ohio State, which also commissioned their play on the life and times of James Thurber, &quot;Jabberwock&quot; (1972).

In all, they collaborated on 39 works, including a 1956 musical adaptation of James Hilton&#x27;s &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, entitled &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, with the author himself. They also adapted &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; into the hit musical &quot;Mame&quot; with composer Jerry Herman, which won a Tony Award for its star, Angela Lansbury. Less successful was the Lawrence and Lee collaboration with Herman, also starring Lansbury, &quot;Dear World&quot;, a musical adaptation of Giraudoux&#x27;s &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot;. They also co-wrote a script for a made-for-television &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; film, which was never produced.

Several of Lawrence and Lee&#x27;s plays draw on events from United States history to speak to contemporary issues. &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1955) addressed intellectual freedom and McCarthyism through a fictionalized version of the Scopes Monkey Trial. &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot; (1959) examined government corruption in the 1920s. &quot;The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail&quot; (1970) was a Vietnam-era exploration of Thoreau&#x27;s resistance to an earlier war.

Lawrence taught playwriting in the Master of Professional Writing Program at the University of Southern California. Lawrence&#x27;s one Tony Award nomination was for Best Book of a Musical for &quot;Mame&quot;.

He died due to complications from a stroke in Malibu, California.

The Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee Theatre Research Institute, a research facility and archive, was dedicated in Lawrence and Lee&#x27;s honor at the Ohio State University in 1986.

His niece is flutist Paula Robison.

<text>Peter David Lebling (born October 30, 1949) is an American interactive fiction game designer (implementor) and programmer who has worked at various companies, including Infocom and Avid.

==Life and career==
He was born in Washington, D.C., grew up in Maryland, and attended MIT, where he obtained a degree in political science before becoming a member of its Laboratory for Computer Science.

After encountering the original &quot;Adventure&quot; game (also called &quot;Colossal Cave&quot;), he was fascinated by the concept and—together with Marc Blank, Tim Anderson and Bruce Daniels—set out to write an adventure game with a better parser, which became &quot;Zork&quot;. In 1979, he became one of the founders of Infocom.

His games include &quot;Zork I,&quot; &quot;II&quot; and &quot;III&quot;, &quot;Starcross&quot;, &quot;Suspect&quot;, &quot;Spellbreaker&quot;, &quot;The Lurking Horror&quot;, &quot;Maze&quot; and &quot;James Clavell&#x27;s Shōgun&quot;.

After Infocom&#x27;s end in 1989, Lebling worked on a GUI spreadsheet program, joined Avid (a company doing special effects for broadcast and film), and designed server applications at Ucentric.

Lebling currently resides in Concord, Massachusetts with his wife. He is a programmer for British defense contractor BAE Systems.

<text>The Gunsan Hwamul (Cargo) Line () is an abandoned cargo railway line serving North Jeolla Province in South Korea. Before January 1, 2008, this line was called Gunsan Line which connected the major railway junction of Iksan (on the Honam Line) to the city of Gunsan.

As of January 2008, New connecting line between Janghang (Janghang Line) and Daeya opened. Iksan – Daeya was included into Janghang Line,new Gunsan station opened, old Gunsan Station was renamed Gunsan Freight Station, passenger transportation between Daeya Station and Gunsan Freight Station was stopped and the line was renamed to Gunsan Hwamul (Cargo) Line.

As of December 2020, new connecting line (Gunsan Port Line) between Janghang Line, Okgu Line and Gunsan Port opened. Therefore Gunsan Hwamul Line is abandoned.

<text>The Janghang Line is a railway line serving South Chungcheong Province in South Korea. The line connects Cheonan (on the Gyeongbu Line) to the railway junction city of Iksan. The Janghang Line is served by frequent Saemaeul-ho and Mugunghwa-ho passenger train services between Seoul and Iksan. There is also a link from Asan station to the KTX network at Cheonan-Asan station.

==History==

The original Janghang Line was opened along its full length running between Cheonan and Janghang by the Chosen Gyeongnam Railway on June 1, 1922.

===Upgrade===

The entire Janghang Line is being electrified, double-tracked, and upgraded for higher speeds with a straighter alignment. Work started in 1997 from Cheonan. By the end of 2008, the new alignment was in service from Cheonan via Asan and Hongseong to Sinseong, from Jupo to Nampo, and from Ganchi to Janghang, and electrification was put in service on the first between Cheonan and Sinchang, after Asan, on December 15, 2008. The section near Janghang, opened in December 2007, also linked up the Janghang Line with the previously isolated Iksan-Gunsan line via a new bridge over the Geum River, with alignment built for two tracks but initially only one track was laid. In 2010, the remaining sections were slated to be completed by 2018, but complete double-tracking and electrification was no longer planned on the short term due to expected low demand. The realigned Nampo-Ganchi section, including the relocated Ungcheon station, was opened on January 5, 2021. As of April 2023, the double-tracking of the Sinchang-Hongseong section was 85% completed and expected to be opened in the second half of 2024. Also as of April 2023, the double-tracking of the Hongseong-Daeya section, including the Sinseong-Jupo realignment that was scheduled to begin construction in 2023, was in advanced planning, with a 2027 completion targeted.

The Janghang Line will link up with the Seohae Line at Hongseong station. The Seohae Line will connect Hongseong to Hwaseong in Gyeonggi-do when it opens in the second half of 2024. It will be connected to southern extension of the Sosa–Wonsi Line and Sinansan Line. Seohae Line will serve speed, which will dramatically reduce travel time between Seoul and Hongseong.

Sinchang-Hongseong section will be double track electrifed when Seohae Line open.

<doc id="516807" wikidata="Q1328358" url="?curid=516807" title="Cuban cuisine">
<text>Cuban cuisine is largely based on Spanish cuisine with influence from Taino, African and other Caribbean cuisines. Some Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish, Taino and African cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor. This results in a blend of several different cultural influences. A small but noteworthy Chinese influence can also be accounted for, mainly in the Havana area. There is also some Italian influence. During colonial times, Cuba was an important port for trade, and the Spanish ancestors of Cubans brought with them the culinary traditions of different parts of Spain.

==Overview==
As a result of the colonization of Cuba by Spain, one of the main influences on the cuisine is from Spain. Other culinary influences include the Taíno, the indigenous people of Cuba, Africa, from the Africans who were brought to Cuba as slaves, and French, from the French colonists who came to Cuba from Haiti. Another factor is that Cuba is an island, making seafood something that greatly influences Cuban cuisine. Another contributing factor to Cuban cuisine is that Cuba is in a tropical climate, which produces fruits and root vegetables that are used in Cuban dishes and meals.

A typical meal consists of rice and beans, cooked together or apart. When cooked together the recipe is called &quot;congri&quot; or &quot;Moros&quot; or &quot;Moros y Cristianos&quot; (black beans and rice). If cooked separately it is called &quot;arroz con frijoles&quot; (rice with beans) or &quot;arroz y frijoles&quot; (rice and beans).

==Cuban sandwich==

A Cuban sandwich (sometimes called a &quot;mixto&quot;, especially in Cuba) is a popular lunch item that grew out of the once-open flow of cigar workers between Cuba and Florida (specifically Key West and the Ybor City neighborhood of Tampa) in the late 19th century and has since spread to other Cuban American communities.

The sandwich is built on a base of lightly buttered Cuban bread and contains sliced roast pork, thinly sliced Serrano ham, Swiss cheese, dill pickles, and yellow mustard. In Tampa, Genoa salami is traditionally layered in with the other meats, probably due to the influence of Italian immigrants who lived side by side with Cubans and Spaniards in Ybor City. Tomatoes and lettuce are available additions in many restaurants, but these are considered by traditionalists as an unacceptable Americanization of the sandwich.

After assembly, the Cuban sandwich may be pressed in a grooveless panini-type grill called a &quot;plancha&quot;, which both heats and compresses the contents.

<text>Robert Burren Morgan (October 5, 1925 – July 16, 2016) was an American politician. He was a Democratic United States Senator from the state of North Carolina for a single term from 1975 to 1981.

==Life and career==
Born in Lillington, North Carolina, Morgan attended Lillington public schools and later East Carolina College and Wake Forest University School of Law.

Morgan&#x27;s political career began early when political leaders in his home county of Harnett County, including highly respected Democratic stalwart Veneble Baggett, visited him at the Wake Forest Law School and urged him to run for Clerk of Court. Morgan did so and was elected. After building a reputation in that office, he went into the private practice of law. His skill as a trial lawyer caused his practice to grow, and he soon established a reputation that extended across the state. Personal injury, real property and antitrust law were among his specialties.

He next ran for the North Carolina State Senate and won. He rose to the Senate&#x27;s highest office, President Pro Tempore, and chaired key committees.

In 1968, Morgan challenged long-time incumbent Attorney General Wade Bruton in the Democratic Party primary, defeated him, and then won the General Election. He served one four-year term and then was re-elected. Under Morgan, the office was split into five divisions each responsible to a deputy attorney general, with a sixth division later added. He served two years of that term and then resigned to run for the U.S. Senate.

Early in his political career, Morgan was considered a supporter of segregation because of his allegiance to his former Wake Forest law professor, politician I. Beverly Lake, Sr., who ran an unsuccessful pro-segregation campaign for governor in 1960 against the progressive supporter of civil rights, Terry Sanford.
But later, as an influential state senator, as North Carolina attorney general from 1969 to 1974, and as the successful candidate to succeed Democratic U.S. Senator Sam Ervin, Morgan was considered a moderate.

After winning the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate in 1974, Morgan resigned as attorney general effective August 26. He then won the general election over Republican William Stevens, garnering 63% of the vote.

Morgan was defeated for re-election in 1980 by Republican John Porter East in an extremely close race. Morgan returned to the practice of law and also served as director of North Carolina&#x27;s State Bureau of Investigation under Attorney General Lacy Thornburg.

From 2000 to 2003, Morgan served as founding president of the North Carolina Center for Voter Education, a Raleigh, North Carolina based nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that seeks to increase civic engagement in North Carolina. Morgan was president emeritus of that organization.

Morgan died at the age of 90 at his home in Buies Creek, North Carolina on July 16, 2016.

<text>John Porter East (May 5, 1931 – June 29, 1986) was an American Republican politician who served as a U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina from 1981 until his suicide in 1986.

A paraplegic since 1955 because of polio, East was a professor of political science at East Carolina University in Greenville.

== Early life and education ==
John Porter East was born in Springfield, Illinois, on May 5, 1931, the son of an employee of the State of Illinois. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Earlham College in Indiana where he was left tackle on the football team. After his graduation in 1953, he married Priscilla Sherk and was commissioned as an officer in the United States Marine Corps. In 1955, East contracted polio while serving at Camp Lejeune. He would never walk again. He received a LL.B. degree from the University of Illinois College of Law and practiced law in Naples, Florida, for one year. He went on to receive his M.A. and Ph.D. in political science from the University of Florida.

== Political career ==

East was a protégé of conservative Senator Jesse Helms. In 1966, East ran unsuccessfully for a vacancy in the United States House of Representatives in a special election, a race won by Walter B. Jones Sr.

In 1980, East narrowly defeated incumbent Democratic Senator Robert Burren Morgan.

In the Senate, he earned a reputation as a staunch social conservative, especially on the issue of abortion. Alongside Jesse Helms, East led opposition to the bill to create a federal holiday to honor Martin Luther King Jr. in 1983.

East was also a national security hawk, and was a member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Security and Terrorism along with Orrin Hatch and Jeremiah Denton. The committee is notable for its accusations of Soviet infiltration of left-wing think tanks, publications and activist groups such as the Institute for Policy Studies and the magazine &quot;Mother Jones&quot;. East&#x27;s primary national security staffer on the committee, Samuel T. Francis, later a prominent columnist for &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, has been cited as an intellectual fore-bearer of the alt-right movement.

In 1986, East announced that he would not seek re-election, and would instead return to his teaching position.

== Death ==
On Friday, June 27, 1986, East completed work on the book galleys of his collected essays. He met with Supreme Court nominee Antonin Scalia. Then, commitments met, East drove to Greenville with his aide, John Petree, and arrived home about noon on Saturday. Petree stayed with him until daughter Kathryn arrived for a visit. Kathryn left her father &quot;in good spirits&quot; about midnight. Petree returned to East&#x27;s house on Sunday morning, June 29. He found the front door ajar. The senator was dead in his garage, a victim of suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. He left a note that blamed his doctor for failing to diagnose hypothyroidism, which he believed had robbed him of his intellectual abilities. North Carolina Governor James G. Martin appointed U.S. Representative Jim Broyhill to serve out the rest of East&#x27;s term.

East is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>James Thomas Broyhill (August 19, 1927 – February 18, 2023) was an American businessman and politician from North Carolina. A member of the Republican Party, he served in both chambers of the United States Congress as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1963 to 1986 and briefly served in the United States Senate in 1986. He represented much of the Foothills region of the state in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1963 to 1986, and served in the U.S. Senate for nearly four months in 1986. He had a career in the furniture industry before entering politics.

==Biography==
Broyhill was born in Lenoir, North Carolina, the youngest of four children related to furniture magnate James Edgar Broyhill and the former Satie Hunt. The senior Broyhill was a member of the Republican National Committee for 28 years. However, for most of that time the party was sparsely supported within the Southern United States, including North Carolina. After attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Jim Broyhill joined his father&#x27;s company in 1945 and served in various capacities there until 1962. He was also active in several state industry associations, as well as a civic leader in Lenoir.

=== U.S. House of Representatives ===

Broyhill believed there needed to be a more competitive election landscape in North Carolina, and that he could play a role in strengthening the Republican party by running for office himself.

Broyhill made his first run for elected office in 1962 for North Carolina&#x27;s 9th congressional district. Broyhill was the unexpected beneficiary of redistricting after the 1960 census, which cost North Carolina a congressional district. The Democratic-controlled General Assembly saw a chance to get rid of the then lone Republican in the congressional delegation, Charles R. Jonas of the Charlotte area, by re-drawing his district from under him. In the process, they shifted some strongly Republican areas into the 9th, a district where growing Republican influence had kept five-term Democrat Hugh Quincy Alexander from establishing a foothold. At the same time, they shifted some strongly Democratic areas of the 9th into the new 8th district designed to defeat Jonas. However, the plan backfired disastrously when Jonas handily defeated 8th district incumbent Alvin Paul Kitchin and Broyhill defeated Alexander by just under one percentage point in an upset.

Broyhill never faced another contest nearly that close again. Due to his very conservative stances on nearly all issues and an emphasis on taking good care of his constituents (most of whom had never been represented by a Republican before), he became very popular in his district. He won reelection by 11 points in the midst of the gigantic Democratic landslide of 1964, in which Lyndon B. Johnson carried 87 of North Carolina&#x27;s 100 counties. Broyhill won reelection 10 times thereafter, never receiving less than 54 percent of the vote and only winning by less than 10 points twice in what became the most Republican district in North Carolina. His district was renumbered the 10th in 1969.

A highlight of his long service in the House was his leadership role in creating the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.

==== U.S. Senate ====
On June 29, 1986, Senator John Porter East, who was not seeking re-election, committed suicide. Broyhill already had won the Republican nomination for the race to succeed East, and Governor of North Carolina James G. Martin appointed Broyhill to the seat for the remainder of the term. The plan was to give Broyhill an incumbency advantage over the Democratic nominee, former Governor Terry Sanford. However, Sanford narrowly defeated Broyhill in November and took office immediately.

<text>Janice Miner (October 15, 1917 – February 15, 2004) was an American actress best known as the character Madge the manicurist in Palmolive dish-washing detergent television commercials from the 1960s to the 1990s.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===

Janice Miner was the daughter of a dentist and a painter, and had three brothers, Sheldon, Donald and Lyndsey. She studied at the Vesper George School of Art in her native Boston, then studied acting under Lee Strasberg and others. She made her stage debut in 1945 in a Boston production of Elmer Rice&#x27;s &quot;Street Scene&quot;.

Miner then became established on radio, and worked through the 1950s in several series simultaneously. Among other roles, she was one of three actresses who played secretary Della Street on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; and one of five to play girlfriend Ann Williams on &quot;Casey, Crime Photographer&quot;. She also appeared as Mary Wesley on &quot;Boston Blackie&quot;.

Miner played featured roles in the anthology series &quot;Radio City Playhouse&quot;, in &quot;Soundless&quot;, &quot;Portrait of Lenore&quot; and other episodes. Her appearance in the premiere broadcast of the series &quot;created a minor sensation in the play &quot;Long Distance&quot;&quot;; the episode proved so popular that she repeated her performance later in the season.

From circa 1948 through some time before the series ended in 1957, Miner starred as Julie Erickson, head of the titular orphanage in the soap opera &quot;Hilltop House&quot;, during most of the show&#x27;s revival beginning in 1948. The series was sponsored by the Colgate-Palmolive Company, for which she later appeared in a famous, long-running series of television commercials.

===Broadway career===
As radio drama faded with the popularity of television, Miner turned to the theater and made her New York City debut in the 1958 melodrama &quot;Obbligato&quot; at Theatre Marquee, adapted by Jane Hinton Gates from the novel &quot;Une Ombre&quot; by Paul Vialar; Miner starred as a spinster in romantic competition with her younger sister, played by Carol Vandermeir. In 1960 she made her Broadway debut in &quot;Viva Madison Avenue!&quot;, a comedy about the advertising world by George Panetta, at the Longacre Theatre.

===Television icon===

Miner appeared on television in several shows, among them &quot;Boston Blackie&quot; and &quot;Casey, Crime Photographer&quot;, in roles she originated on radio. She became an icon to TV viewers as Madge, the wisecracking manicurist in commercials for Palmolive dish-washing detergent. In an advertising campaign created by the agency Ted Bates Advertising, Madge worked at the Salon East Beauty Parlor and soaked her customers’ fingernails in Palmolive (&quot;Palmolive softens hands while you do the dishes&quot;). The campaign ran from 1966 to 1992.

Miner&#x27;s Palmolive commercials appeared in other countries, where Madge was often given a different name. In France she was called Françoise; in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria she was known as Tilly; in Finland as Marissa; and in Denmark as Sylvia. In Australia and New Zealand, Madge was played by Robina Beard. Madge&#x27;s trademark line, &quot;You&#x27;re soaking in it,&quot; became one of the more famous and parodied television commercial quotes. 

Miner was a regular on the 1974 CBS situation comedy &quot;Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers&quot; in which she played the mother of the character portrayed by Paul Sand.

===Theater and film career===
Following her 1960 debut, Miner appeared on Broadway in &quot;The Milk Train Doesn&#x27;t Stop Here Anymore&quot; (1963) and &quot;Butterflies Are Free&quot; (1972) (in each as an understudy); the 1973 revival of &quot;The Women&quot;; the 1976 revival of &quot;The Heiress&quot; with Jane Alexander; the 1980 revival of &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot;, by Lillian Hellman; the 1983–1984 Circle in the Square Theatre revival of &quot;Heartbreak House&quot;, with Rex Harrison, Philip Bosco, Rosemary Harris, Amy Irving, Dana Ivey, and Stephen McHattie; and the Franco Zeffirelli productions of Terrence McNally&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Lady of the Camellias&quot; (1963) and Eduardo De Filippo&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Sunday Monday&quot; (1974). 

She also appeared in Shakespeare on Broadway, as Emilia in the American National Theater and Academy production of &quot;Othello&quot; (1970), starring Moses Gunn; and as Juliet&#x27;s nurse in director Theodore Mann&#x27;s Circle in the Square production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1977). Other theater work included &quot;Major Barbara&quot;.

In 1986, Miner appeared at the off-Broadway Lucille Lortel Theatre as Gertrude Stein in the play &quot;Gertrude Stein and a Companion&quot;, by Win Wells, with Marian Seldes as Alice B. Toklas. Miner and Seldes reprised the roles in a June 1987 television version for Bravo. Miner also appeared for six seasons in repertory roles at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Connecticut.

Miner played Lenny Bruce&#x27;s mother, Sally Marr, in the Bob Fosse film &quot;Lenny&quot; (1974) with Dustin Hoffman as Lenny Bruce and Valerie Perrine as Honey Bruce. She also appeared in &quot;The Swimmer&quot; (1968), &quot;Willie &amp; Phil&quot; (1980), &quot;Endless Love&quot; (1981), and as the Mother Superior in &quot;Mermaids&quot; (1990). Her latter-day work in television included an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;.

==Personal life==
Miner was married to actor and writer Richard Merrell (1925–1998) from 1963 until his death from heart failure at age 73, on September 13, 1998. The two often appeared together onstage, including in &quot;The Gin Game&quot; at the Missouri Repertory Theater, (later renamed the Kansas City Repertory Theatre), as well as in &quot;Night Must Fall&quot;, &quot;High Spirits&quot;, and what Miner called their favorite play together, Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey Into Night&quot; at the Byrdcliffe Theater in Woodstock, New York.

Miner adopted a daughter named Molly Rose in the early 1960s. She resided in Southbury, Connecticut in her later years, and died at the Bethel Health Care Facility in Bethel, Connecticut, after several years of failing health. She was cremated.

<text>The Gaya Line is a railway line of Korail in Busan Metropolitan City, South Korea, connecting Sasang on the Gyeongbu Line with Beom-il on the Donghae Line via Gaya, where the line also connects to the Bujeon Line.

==History==
The line was originally opened by the Chosen Government Railway on 10 June 1944 as the Busan Marshalling Yard Line between Sasang and Busanjin; after the end of the Pacific War and the subsequent partition of Korea the line was taken over by the Korean National Railroad, which renamed it Gaya Line on 1 September 1955. On 21 January 1968 the line&#x27;s terminus was changed from Busanjin to Beom-il.

On 2 December 2002 commuter passenger service on the line was discontinued, and on the 28th electrification and double-tracking of the line was completed.

<text>The Daegu Line () is a railway line in South Korea. The line connects Gacheon station on the Gyeongbu Line in Daegu to Yeongcheon on the Jungang Line. The line is served by frequent passenger trains between Seoul (via the Gyeongbu Line), Dongdaegu, and Gyeongju, Pohang and Ulsan (via the Jungang and Donghae Nambu Lines).

==History==

The first section of the Daegu Line was opened in 1917, between Daegu and Hayang. The line was extended to the Haksan station in Pohang until 1919 as follows:
A branch was opened from Gyeongju to Ulsan on October 25, 1921.

The sections from Gyeongju to Pohang and Ulsan were integrated into the Donghae Nambu Line on December 16, 1935. On 1 July 1938 the reconstruction of the section Daegu–Yeongcheon was complete with the standard gauge. On 1 December 1938 the section Yeongcheon–Gyeongju became a part of the Gyeonggyeong Nambu Line (the southern part of the Jungang Line), which was established on April 1, 1942. At the same time the present section was renamed the Daegu Line.

===Upgrade===

The section from Dongdaegu to Cheongcheon was replaced by a new alignment that takes the Daegu Line to meet the Gyeongbu Line at Gacheon, lengthening the Dongdaegu–Cheongcheon line distance to . The Dongdaegu to Cheongcheon rail distance changed to , line proper from Gacheon to Yeongcheon is long. The project was launched in August 1997 with a planned completion in 2000, but economic difficulties and planning changes delayed completion, the line relocation was finally inaugurated on November 3, 2005. Part of the project was the replacement of a branch to Daegu Airport from the old alignment with a spur line paralleling the highway west from Cheongcheon to the airport, finished a year later.

The Daegu Line was considered for an upgrade to a double-tracked, electrified railway in a straighter, long alignment from 2000. Detailed plans were prepared by 2009, the foreseen budget was 988.042 billion won, and the completion of the project was set for 2017. On September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020. As part of the plan, the Daegu Line is to be set out for 230 km/h and may see KTX service. On 28 December 2021, electrification was completed.

<doc id="516842" wikidata="Q1188691" url="?curid=516842" title="Peace Bridge">
<text>The Peace Bridge is an international bridge over the Niagara River between Canada and the United States, located just north of the river&#x27;s source at the east end of Lake Erie about upriver of Niagara Falls. It connects Buffalo, New York, in the United States to Fort Erie, Ontario, in Canada. It is operated and maintained by the bi-national Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Authority.

The Peace Bridge consists of five arched spans over the Niagara River and a Parker deck-type truss span over the Black Rock Canal on the American side of the river. The length is . Material used in the construction included of steelwork, 9,000 tons of structural steel and 800 tons of reinforcing steel in the concrete abutments. The Peace Bridge was named to commemorate 100 years of peace between the United States and Canada. It was constructed as a highway bridge to address pedestrian and motor vehicle traffic which could not be accommodated on the International Railway Bridge, built in 1873.

==History==

The building of the Peace Bridge was approved by the International Joint Commission on August 6, 1925. Edward Lupfer served as chief engineer. A major obstacle to building the bridge was the swift river current, which averages . Construction began in 1925 and was completed in the spring of 1927. On March 13, 1927, Lupfer drove the first car across the bridge. On June 1, 1927, the bridge was opened to the public.

The official opening ceremony was held two months later, on August 7, 1927, with about 20,000 in attendance. The festivities were transmitted to the public via radio in the first international coast-to-coast broadcast. Newspapers at the time estimated that as many as 50 million listeners may have heard the broadcast.

The dignitaries who took part in the dedication ceremonies included The Prince of Wales (the future Edward VIII), Prince George, Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, U.S. Vice President Charles Dawes, Secretary of State Frank Kellogg, New York Governor Al Smith and Ontario Premier Howard Ferguson.

When the bridge opened, Buffalo and Fort Erie each became the chief port of entry to their respective countries from the other. At the time it was the only vehicular bridge on the Great Lakes from Niagara Falls to New York. The bridge remains one of North America&#x27;s important commercial ports with four thousand trucks crossing it daily.

After new toll facilities were installed on the Canadian side in 2005, the Peace Bridge became the first E-ZPass facility outside the United States. There are no fees for entering the US.

==Alternatives==
The Peace Bridge is one of the busiest on the Canada–United States border, with over one million trucks crossing it each year and delays of up to almost four hours. Other nearby bridges between the United States and Canada include the Rainbow Bridge, the Queenston-Lewiston Bridge and the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge. The Queenston-Lewiston Bridge and the Peace Bridge are the only Niagara River crossings that allow heavy trucks.

==Customs inspection and toll plazas==

There are customs plazas at both ends of the bridge, with the Canadian plaza the newer and larger of the two.

The inbound customs plaza in the United States has seven lanes for trucks and nine for cars. Pedestrians and cyclists are processed to the left of the truck inspection area.

The inbound customs plaza in Canada was designed by NORR Limited Architects and Engineers and completed in 2010. There are 14 booths/lanes for cars and a separate area for trucks (handling five trucks at a time). Pedestrians and cyclists are processed in an area on the right side of the inspection area for cars.

Once vehicles leave the customs plaza in Canada, vehicles approach a smaller toll plaza to pay toll for using the Peace Bridge. Payment for tolls are accepted in cash ($8.00 USD or $10.25 CAD), E-ZPass ($4.00 USD), or old Peace Bridge tokens. There are no toll booths when entering the U.S. and no tolls for pedestrians or cyclists.

===Preclearance===

In October 2012, it was announced by the DHS and Public Safety Canada that a pilot program, years in the works, to preclear all truck traffic from Canada into Buffalo would be commenced. The pilot would start in late December 2012 and run for 18 months, after which the economic benefits would be assessed and its feasibility to make permanent would then be recommended to both the U.S Congress and the Parliament of Canada.

==Road connections==
The New York State Department of Transportation designates the bridge as , an unsigned reference route. Interstate 190 adjoins the bridge and has a direct northbound off-ramp (exit 9) to it. The Queen Elizabeth Way begins at the Canada–United States border.

==Commemorations==


* Buffalo resident Emma M. Herold-Haft composed the &quot;Peace Bridge March&quot; in honor of the bridge&#x27;s opening in 1927.
* On August 4, 1977, Canada Post and the United States Postal Service brought out a joint issue of postage stamps to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the bridge. Unusual for joint issues, the two designs are radically different, with the US print being all blue and the Canadian print in full colour).

<doc id="516845" wikidata="Q2251017" url="?curid=516845" title="Dartmouth BASIC">
<text>Dartmouth BASIC is the original version of the BASIC programming language. It was designed by two professors at Dartmouth College, John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz. With the underlying Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS), it offered an interactive programming environment to all undergraduates as well as the larger university community.

Several versions were produced at Dartmouth, implemented by undergraduate students and operating as a compile and go system. The first version ran on 1 May 1964, and it was opened to general users in June. Upgrades followed, culminating in the seventh and final release in 1979. Dartmouth also introduced a dramatically updated version known as Structured BASIC (or SBASIC) in 1975, which added various structured programming concepts. SBASIC formed the basis of the American National Standards Institute-standard Standard BASIC efforts in the early 1980s.

Most dialects of BASIC trace their history to the Fourth Edition (which added, e.g., string variables, which most BASIC users take for granted, though the original could print strings), but generally leave out more esoteric features like matrix math. In contrast to the Dartmouth compilers, most other BASICs were written as interpreters. This decision allowed them to run in the limited main memory of early microcomputers. Microsoft BASIC is one example, designed to run in only 4 KB of memory. By the late 1980s, tens of millions of home computers were running some variant of the MS interpreter. It became the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for BASIC, which led to the abandonment of the ANSI SBASIC efforts. Kemeny and Kurtz later formed a company to develop and promote a version of SBASIC known as True BASIC.

Many early mainframe games trace their history to Dartmouth BASIC and the DTSS system. A selection of these were collected, in HP Time-Shared BASIC versions, in the People&#x27;s Computer Company book &quot;What to Do After You Hit Return&quot;. Many of the original source listings in &quot;BASIC Computer Games&quot; and related works also trace their history to Dartmouth BASIC.

==Development history==

===Earlier work===
John G. Kemeny joined the mathematics department of Dartmouth College in 1953 and later became its department chairman. In 1956 he gained access to an IBM 704 via MIT&#x27;s New England Regional Computer Center efforts. That year, he wrote the DARSIMCO language, a version of assembler which simplified the programming of mathematical operations. He was aided by Thomas E. Kurtz, who joined the department that year.

DARSIMCO was forgotten when the first FORTRAN compiler was installed on the machine in 1957. The arrival of FORTRAN instilled an important lesson. Kurtz, having been indoctrinated that FORTRAN was slow, spent several months writing a program in 704 assembler which had taken up about an hour of CPU time to debug and still was not running. Giving up, he rewrote it in FORTRAN and had it running in five minutes. The lesson was that high-level languages could save time, regardless of their measured performance.

In 1959, the school received its first computer, the drum-based LGP-30. One student wrote a FORTRAN-inspired language called DART for the machine. This led to an effort to produce an ALGOL 58 compiler, turning to ALGOL 60 when that definition was finalized. Writing the compiler was difficult due to the very small memory size, 32 KB in modern terms, and was extremely slow, based on the drum speed of 3600 rpm. Nevertheless, they were able to produce a functional cut-down version known as ALGOL 30. Further development produced SCALP, the &quot;Self-Contained Algol Processor&quot;, a one-pass compiler that was ready to run the compiled program as soon as the punched tape finished reading in the source. Output with the program results or any error messages would immediately appear. This compile-and-go style of operation would later be used by BASIC.

In 1962, Kemeny and high-school student Sidney Marshall began experimenting with a new language, DOPE (Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment). This used numbered lines to represent instructions, for instance, to add two numbers, DOPE used:

 5 + A B C

Which meant &quot;on line 5, perform an addition of the values in variables A and B and put the result in C&quot;. Although somewhat cryptic in layout, the basis for the future BASIC language can be seen. In addition to basic mathematical operations, the language included SQR, EXP, LOG, SIN and a simple branching construct.

===Computing in liberal arts===
Kemeny and Kurtz agreed on the need for programming literacy among students outside the traditional STEM fields; only 25% of the students at Dartmouth took STEM-related courses, but some level of mathematics was used in almost every field. Moreover, as computers became more important in society, they wondered &quot;How can sensible decisions about computing and its use be made by persons essentially ignorant of it?&quot;

Kemeny later noted that &quot;Our vision was that every student on campus should have access to a computer, and any faculty member should be able to use a computer in the classroom whenever appropriate. It was as simple as that.&quot; But doing so would be largely impossible given what they had to work with; the turnaround on a typical SCALP run was about 15 minutes, and the languages were far too difficult for non-STEM users to use for basic tasks.

It was not simply the complexity that was a problem, it was the entire concept of the batch processing. Students would prepare their programs on punch cards or paper tape, submit them to the computer operators, and then at some future point receive their output. This would often reveal an error that required the entire process to be repeated. As they later put it, &quot;If it takes on the order of 1 day for one try, the student will either lose interest or forget what the problems were. At best, he will waste time standing around waiting for the day&#x27;s results to appear.&quot;

In 1959, due largely to Kemeny&#x27;s reputation as an innovator in math teaching, the department won an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation award for $500,000 to build a new department building.

===Developing the concept===
During a 1961 visit to MIT, they were introduced to the PDP-1 and its recently completed experimental time-sharing operating system. John McCarthy asked Kurtz why they did not use time sharing for their efforts to bring computing to the masses. Kurtz returned to Dartmouth and told Kemeny &quot;we should do time sharing&quot;, to which Kemeny immediately replied &quot;OK&quot;.

In an experiment to test whether the concept was workable, students were broken into groups of five and given turns on the LGP-30 using SCALP. Computer time was broken into 15-minute sessions and each group of five was given one session and then turned it over to the next group. It was found that students could generally complete their programs in two or three &quot;turnarounds&quot; during a single session. This clearly suggested that an interactive system would allow hundreds of users to successfully use a single machine.

The arrival of the Teletype Model 33 teleprinter using the newly introduced ASCII over telephone lines solved the problem of access; no longer would the programmers have to submit the programs on cards or paper tape, they would now use the Model 33 to type directly into the computer. All that was needed was a new machine that was fast enough to host a time-sharing system, and a simple language for the programmers to use.

When the topic of a simple language began to be considered seriously, Kemeny immediately suggested writing a new one. Kurtz was more interested in a cut-down version of FORTRAN or ALGOL. But these languages had so many idiosyncrasies that Kurtz came to agree with Kemeny:

Over time, four key elements emerged; the system would use time-sharing, a new language would be needed, to get users onto the system new courses would introduce programming as an adjunct to other subjects, and finally, the terminals would be open to all users.

===Initial version===
The project officially started in September 1963. The goal was to develop the language and operating system on an off-the-shelf computer. In early 1964, they approached the National Science Foundation (NSF) for funding. The NSF sent the proposals, one for the time sharing system and another for the language, out for peer review. The reviews invariably suggested they did not understand the difficulty of what they were attempting. In spite of these negative comments, the NSF went ahead with both grants. Educational discounts available from General Electric led to the purchase of a GE-225 computer, in an era when not &quot;going IBM&quot; was still fraught with peril.

The GE-225 was paired with the much simpler DATANET-30 (DN-30) machine and a hard drive connected to both machines in order to share programs. The DN-30 lacked any programming documentation at the time, as it was never intended to be shipped from the factory without a program already installed. It included one key feature, direct memory access (DMA) access to the larger GE machines. This meant small messages could be quickly passed back and forth between the machines, allowing commands typed by the user to be immediately performed by the 225.

The system would work by having the DN-30 run the terminals and save the user&#x27;s work to the disk. When the user typed codice_1, the DN-30 would use DMA to send that command to the GE-225. The 225 would read that file, compile it, run it, and pass back the results to the DN-30 which would print the output on the terminal.

In the summer of 1963, pending the purchase of the computer, GE provided access to one of their GE-225s. Kemeny began working on a prototype compiler. Students Michael Busch and John McGeachie began working on the operating system design that fall. Both the language and the OS were extensively modified during this period, although the basic goals remained the same and were published in a draft form that November.

The school&#x27;s machine arrived in the last week of February 1964, was operational by mid-March, and officially handed over on 1 April. By that point, the operating system design was already well developed. Most of the student programmers working on the operating system did so for 50 hours a week, in addition to their normal course load. The language was developed in parallel on borrowed time on another 225 machine. The OS was completed in April, and the entire system running on three Model 33 terminals was ready by the end of the month. John Kemeny and John McGeachie ran the first BASIC program on 1 May 1964 at 4 a.m. ET.

It is not completely clear what the first programs were. Many sources, including Dartmouth, claim it was this simple program:

 PRINT 2 + 2

A later history of the language states that two programs were typed in at the same time, one by Kemeny and one by another unnamed programmer. They typed in their programs, typed at the same time, and received the correct results. Kurtz was an early riser and had already gone home and &quot;missed all the fun.&quot;

Over the next month the system was tested by having a numerical analysis class test programs on the system. During this period, the machine remained running properly for an average of five minutes. The problems were rapidly addressed, and in June it was decided to increase the number of terminals to eleven. It was around this time that a faster GE-235 replaced the 225. By the fall, 20 terminals were in use.

GE began to refer to the combination of GE-235 and DN-30 as the GE-265, adding their model numbers together. GE built about 75 additional examples of the GE-265, many for their service bureau business. GE referred to these as their Mark I time-sharing systems.

===New system===
One of the original goals of the program was to work programming into other coursework. This was a success, but it put considerable strain on the system and it became clear that it had no room for future growth.

In 1965, the team approached GE for support with ongoing development. In September, Vice President Louis Rader offered the new GE-635, which ran approximately 10 times as fast and included two CPUs. Additionally, a second DN-30 would be added to handle more lines, enough for 150 simultaneous users. To house it, a larger facility would be needed than the basement of College Hall where the 265 was running. Peter Kiewit, Class of &#x27;22, along with additional support from the NSF, led to the construction of the Kiewit Computation Center, which opened in December 1966.

While waiting for this machine to arrive, in the summer and fall of 1966 a GE-635 at the Rome Air Development Center was used to develop MOLDS, the &quot;Multiple User On-Line Debugging System&quot;. The GE-635 was operational in early 1967, and using MOLDS the new operating system was fully functional in September, at which time the GE-265 was sold off.

GE provided the machine for free for three years as part of a wider agreement under which Dartmouth would develop new versions of BASIC while GE used it to develop a new release of their version of the operating system. This collaboration proved to be a success; GE began deploying these machines as their Mark II time-sharing systems, and by the end of the decade they were one of the largest time-sharing vendors in the world.

When this &quot;Phase I&quot; system became operational, the Dartmouth team began development of &quot;Phase II&quot;, the ideal operating system. This was installed in March 1969, and changed its name to the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System shortly thereafter. When the three-year period was up, GE gifted the machine to the university. Although the two teams remained in contact, and several good-faith attempts were made to continue the relationship, little further collaboration occurred and the partnership officially ended on 20 September 1972.

===Expanding user base===
A review in 1968 noted that 80% of the students and 70% of the faculty was making some use of the system. Hundreds of terminals were spread across the campus, from the hospital to the business school. 57% of the CPU time was used for coursework, 16% for research, and the remaining 27% for &quot;recreational use&quot;; Dartmouth actively encouraged users to play games as a way to get hands-on use and overcome fear of the computer.

Beginning with another NSF grant, in 1967 Dartmouth also began placing terminals in off-campus locations, including high schools in the area. In terms of user counts, these terminals hosted 69% of the total users, although they used a smaller amount of computer time. By 1971 there were 79 remote terminals, as far away as New Jersey and Bangor, Maine. These were supported by multiplexer systems that allowed up to 12 terminals to be supported over a single voice-grade telephone line. Additionally, a number of these lines were available for dial-up use with a modem.

===Influence===
Time-sharing was a major area of research in the 1960s, with many in the computer industry predicting that computing power would become inexpensive and widespread. This was most famously stated by John McCarthy, who said &quot;computing may someday be organized as a public utility just as the telephone system is a public utility.&quot;

While other languages were available on DTSS, 98% of its programs were written in BASIC. With BASIC, computer services became far more accessible to end-users whose tasks would take too long to code for them to be suitable for solving on a computer. This led to a number of manufacturers who introduced computers specifically designed for this market of users who wanted to solve small or medium-scale tasks and were not as worried about outright performance. In particular, two machines aimed directly at this market became the &quot;most widely used small time-sharing systems ever developed&quot;.

The HP 2000 ran HP Time-Shared BASIC, a combination of a BASIC and a time-share operating system almost identical to the DTSS setup. The system supported up to 32 simultaneous users, using a low-end HP 2100 CPU to run the terminals in the same fashion as the Datanet-30 of the original GE-265 setup, while the programs ran on a higher-end model of the same machine, typically differing in that it had more core memory. HP&#x27;s BASIC used a semi-compiled tokenized format for storing programs, which improved loading times and meant &quot;compiles&quot; were zero-time.

Digital Equipment Corporation took a different approach, using a single-machine offering based on their existing PDP-11 line with the new RSTS/E operating system and BASIC-PLUS. BASIC-PLUS more closely followed the Fifth Edition, including the codice_2 commands, but was implemented as a pure interpreter as opposed to the Dartmouth compiler or HP&#x27;s tokenized format. It also included a number of control structures following the JOSS model, like . Tymshare SUPER BASIC also supported JOSS-style structures and matrix math, but retained the original compile-and-go operation.

Practically every vendor of the era offered some solution to this same problem, although they may not have been so closely similar to the original. When Kurtz began considering the formation of an ANSI standard for BASIC in 1973, he found that the number of time-sharing service bureaus with BASIC available was greater than any other language. Unfortunately, this success was also a problem; by that point, there were so many variations that a standard seemed impossible.

===Games in BASIC===
Kemeny actively encouraged games on the DTSS platform, and considered it to be one of the major reasons for the success of the DTSS system. He was likely the author of an early mainframe game. Although Kemeny did not take credit for it, he later referred to &quot;FTBALL&quot; by stating it &quot;was written on Sunday after a certain Dartmouth-Princeton game in 1965 when Dartmouth won the Lambert trophy. It&#x27;s sort of a commemorative program&quot;. The game was an upset over heavily favored Princeton.

As the system expanded, especially after the addition of string handling in BASIC, the DTSS system became a major platform for the development of many text-based games. In the early 1970s, the People&#x27;s Computer Company began publishing these in their magazine, typically converted to the more widely available HP BASIC. Many of these listings were collected in their 1975 book, &quot;What to do after you hit return&quot;. Although these are published in HP BASIC form, the majority of them trace their history to either DTSS or the Lawrence Hall of Science in California where a similar machine was set up, known as DECISION.

A more famous collection is &quot;BASIC Computer Games&quot; of 1978, where about half of the programs in the book were either written at Dartmouth, including another by Kemeny, Batnum, or more commonly, one of the many high schools that were connected to it after 1968. A particularly prolific high school was Lexington High School in Massachusetts but many other schools appear as well. A number of the programs do not list their original locations, but come from authors that were likely connected to the system through a school or public projects like Project SOLO.

Multiplayer video games became possible in BASIC when Stephen Garland and John McGeachie developed the MOTIF Multiple Online Terminal Interface for DTSS. To start a game, a user typed LINK followed by a session name instead of RUN, thereby enabling other users to connect to the game by typing JOIN followed by the session name. MOTIF then multiplexed input and output for the BASIC program, prepending a string identifier to the beginning of each line of input and output. The first programs developed with this interface were a two-person version of FTBALL and a five-person poker game. More serious was a management game that allowed up to ten students at the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration to compete in the production and marketing of a single product.

==Versions==
===First Edition===
The original version, retroactively known as version one, supported the commands codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, codice_13, and codice_14. It included basic math instructions, , , and , as well as the up-arrow for exponents &quot;...since on a teletype typewriter it is impossible to print superscripts.&quot; In modern varieties, the up-arrow is normally replaced by the &quot;hat&quot; character, . Exponents took the absolute value of the number before calculation, so to calculate , one had to use . There was a further problem in the exponent function that treated as as opposed to the correct order of operations , which was not corrected until the third release. The codice_15 function always truncated towards zero.

The language had a number of idiosyncrasies of its own. In contrast to later versions, the codice_3 command was required on all statements lacking another command, so was not valid in this version. The codice_4 statement used the comma when printing multiple variables, advancing to the next of five &quot;zones&quot;. The comma was not needed in the case where one was printing a prompt and single value, so was valid. A somewhat hidden feature was that all variables were capable of representing arrays (vectors) of up to ten elements (subscripts 1 to 10, changed to 0 to 9 in the Second Edition) without being declared that way using codice_13. codice_13 was only needed if a different vector size was required.

Variable names were limited to a single letter or a letter followed by a digit (286 possible variable names). User functions could only have a single letter, thus through . All operations were done in floating point. On the GE-225 and GE-235, this produced a precision of about 30 bits (roughly ten digits) with a base-2 exponent range of -256 to +255.

Additionally, due to the GE-235&#x27;s word size being 20-bits and using a six-bit character code, the language enshrined the use of three-letter function names because that allowed the storage of three six-bit characters in a 20-bit word (using 18 bits). This is why BASIC functions are three letters, like codice_20 or codice_21, something that remained in the many varieties of the language long after they left the GE-235.

===Second Edition, CARDBASIC===
The Second Edition of BASIC (though not referred to as such at the time) only made minimal changes. Released in October 1964, it could start arrays at subscript 0 instead of 1 (useful for representing polynomials) and added the semicolon, , to the codice_4 statement. Unlike later implementations where this left space between items, the semicolon advanced printing to the next multiple of three characters, which was useful for &quot;packing&quot; more numbers into a line of output than the existing comma separator. The three-character size was a side-effect of the GE-235&#x27;s 20-bit word size, which stored three six-bit characters. Skipping to the next three-character column was accomplished simply by moving to the next word in memory.

The October version also included a separate definition for CARDBASIC, which was simply a version of BASIC for use on card-based workflows. CARDBASIC was almost identical to the interactive version, with the exception being that it did not include the zero-based arrays. More important to the language&#x27;s future, CARDBASIC added the codice_2 commands that worked with numerical matrices. CARDBASIC was not developed further, as the entire idea of BASIC had been to be interactive.

===Third Edition===
The Third Edition, released in 1966 and the first to use the &quot;edition&quot; naming, was the first designed specifically with the intent of running on the new GE-635 computer which was due to arrive shortly. This version includes the codice_2 functions from CARDBASIC, and they can now use 0 as a subscript.

The new codice_25 function gave the sign of its argument (positive?0 and negative?1), while codice_26 was added to &quot;rewind&quot; the position of codice_27. The exponentiation problem was fixed, so would be interpreted as . Additionally, the codice_20 function was changed to be a true floor, as opposed to trim-toward-zero, which allowed rounding to be implemented with codice_29.

The major change in this version was the new codice_30 statement, which parsed numeric values, making the language truly interactive during execution for the first time; previously the only control one had during execution was to type codice_31 in the monitor. Additionally, the system now allowed, and encouraged, loops to be indented, a feature that was not seen on most other versions of BASIC.

===Fourth Edition===
The Third Edition remained in use through the GE-235&#x27;s lifetime into the fall of 1967. However, as plans were made to receive the GE-635, an experimental version was created on the 635 in the spring of 1967. This version was a partnership between GE and Dartmouth, with GE contributing a new operating system as well as a number of features of BASIC from their own Mark 1 BASIC efforts.

This version, initially published as a supplement to the Third Edition, added the codice_32 command to &quot;seed&quot; the codice_33 function, and the codice_34 &quot;computed goto&quot; that closely matched the similar feature in FORTRAN. This version also allowed codice_35, arguing that codice_9 did not require the codice_7 then it would not be required here. The new codice_38 function moved printing to a given column, from 0 to 74. Another internal change was to once again change the codice_2 to be 1-based; one could use the 0th index, but it would normally be ignored by the various commands.

The major addition for this version was string variables, along with changes to the codice_27 statements which could store strings in them and the codice_30 statement to read them interactively. One feature of the string system was that trailing spaces were deliberately ignored in comparisons, so that &quot;YES&quot; and &quot;YES &quot; were considered equal. This was later realized to be a grave error. String variables were indicated by the dollar sign, e.g. , simply because they were running out of characters that could be found on most keyboards. Someone pointed out that the $ looked like the S in &quot;String&quot;, and that was that.

String manipulation was handled through the new command. This converted the string value in a variable to the equivalent set of ASCII values. The numeric array could then be manipulated and converted back to a string. For instance, this code produces &quot;is&quot; on the console:

Line 140 sets the string length to 2, which has to be managed by the user. The first character is in T(1). While this system is flexible, it was by no means convenient to use. Later versions would address this with new functionality.

Minor changes in this version changed the semicolon in codice_4 statements to do &quot;close packing&quot; of output with no spaces, and the use of the apostrophe as a short-form codice_14.

The official Fourth Edition did not appear until 1968, which added several new features on top of the previous additions. This included the ability to define multi-line functions with the codice_10 command, and the powerful codice_45 statement that treated strings as arrays of ASCII-like codes so individual characters could be operated on without looping over the entire string. This was also the only string manipulation function; to extract a single character or substring, one had to use codice_45 to convert it into an array of numbers, manipulate that array, and then convert it back. This was the reason MAT was 1-based again; the length of the string was placed in location zero, and it needed to be ignored normally.

===Fifth Edition===
The Fifth Edition, from late 1970, once again started as two supplements to the Fourth Edition, from February and April 1969.

The major change was the introduction of file handling. Previously, any pre-defined data that had to be used in the program had to be placed in the lines and then read in one-at-a-time using the command. This feature could be used to read files in a similar fashion. The command could now read a single item from a file and could write one. 

Files were opened through the new keyword, which was followed by a list of string constants describing file names. As these were constants, changing the file name demanded the code be changed to match. The names were assigned numbers, the first name became file #1, and so on. Two file formats were supported, random-access and linear. A linear file was treated as a text file would be today, one could to read a line of text into a string variable, and then to output it to the terminal. Later versions added the to allow files to be specified by strings, although for a time this required a near the top of the program to indicate you were using this format.

For random access files, the name had to specify the type of data within; indicated it contained binary data, while indicated it should be read as strings with a maximum length of . The and could be positioned anywhere in a random-access file with the command, while the current location was returned by the function, and the file length by . During sequential reads, one could also test whether it was at the end of the file using codice_47.

Another major change was the ability for one BASIC program to call another using the command, and pass variables to it using the list. It was later realized that this basic concept had a number of problems, but it was nevertheless used to write some large programs.

String handling received a major update. The new command returned a new string clipped out of another. In the example above, the string &quot;is&quot; is extracted from a larger string. Using the new command, this can be reduced to , which works similarly to the function found in most dialects (). SEG$ uses first and last indices; MID$ uses first index and length. returned the length of a string, which was otherwise now handled internally and did not require calculation in most cases, and returned the position of one string within another, which in most dialects was handled by . The ampersand, , was introduced for string concatenation.

Numerous more minor changes were also added. Among these were two-dimensional string arrays, as opposed to one-dimensional in the previous version, as well as the ability to use the to define string-based functions as well as mathematical. New system-oriented functions included , to work with times and dates, which returned the elapsed time, and which returned the user number, what would today be the username. New string functions included , , , which are common in modern BASIC dialects. The as a short form for also appeared in this version.

===Sixth Edition===
Work on the Sixth Edition began in the fall of 1969 before the Fifth Edition was finalized. A complete specification was written beforehand for the new version. This contrasts with previous versions where the specification documents were based on the changes in the compiler. This version was worked on by Kemeny and Kurtz as well as several former students who returned as faculty: Stephen Garland, John McGeachie, and Robert Hargraves. It was given considerable time to mature, with a beta version running for three months during the summer of 1971, before it was finally released on 21 September 1971. As a result of this maturity, Kurtz described it as &quot;probably the best-designed and most stable software system Dartmouth has ever written.&quot;

One of the biggest changes was the replacement of the earlier codice_48 concept with the much better-defined codice_49 which operated in a fashion similar to codice_50, but it referred to a function name rather than a line number. The functions were defined using codice_51, and took arbitrary parameters in the call rather than using global variables via codice_52 declarations. Another major change was to use file handles (numbers) created with the codice_53 command which is similar to codice_54 which is found in most modern BASICs.codice_55 provided formatted output in a fashion somewhat similar to FORTRAN, while accepted input with no interpretation, allowing commas, semicolons, and even BASIC code to be typed in.

The Sixth Edition was essentially the last version of the original BASIC concept. It remained unchanged for many years. Later versions were significantly different languages.

===SBASIC===
In 1976, Stephen Garland collected a number of structured programming additions to create Dartmouth Structured BASIC, or SBASIC. The primary goal was to replace the control structures based on codice_9 and codice_7 with a variety of block-oriented structures. It did this using a precompiler that took SBASIC source code, converted that to 6th Edition BASIC, and then compiled and ran that as normal. SBASIC also added a number of graphics features, based on the codice_58 command that had been added by other programmers.

Block structures were terminated by matching statements as was the case in ALGOL 68, as opposed to the generic block structures found in languages like Pascal or C. For instance, the codice_59 spanned multiple lines until it ended with a codice_60. The codice_61 loop could also be bottom exited by removing the codice_62 or codice_63 and placing the conditional at the bottom on the codice_60. Infinite loops were supported using codice_65 or codice_66.

&quot;Original&quot; Dartmouth BASIC did not allow statements after a codice_67, only a line number to branch to. SBASIC allowed any statement, so for instance . This basic expansion to the codice_9, pioneered in 1972 with BASIC-PLUS, was already widely supported by most variety of BASICs by this point, including microcomputer versions that were being released at this time. On top of this, SBASIC added block-oriented codice_69 by placing the codice_67 on a separate line and then ending the block with codice_71. On top of this, SBASIC added the codice_72 mechanism that survives to this day in Visual Basic .NET.

SBASIC also added a number of graphics commands intended to be used with plotters. This required the codice_73 to direct subsequent commands to a selected device, and the codice_74 to set up its parameters. From then on, codice_75 would produce dots on the selected plotter, while adding the semicolon at the end of the statement, as used in codice_4, would leave the pen on the paper and produce a line, for instance codice_77.

SBASIC eventually formed the basis of the 1987 ANSI X3.113-1987 Standard for Full Basic, which extended the earlier 1978 ANSI ANSI X3.60-1978 Standard for Minimal Basic. The long delay in producing that standard, along with the lack of regard among computer scientists for unstructured Basic, led the College Board committee developing the Advanced Placement Course in Computer Science, which Garland chaired, to opt for requiring Pascal and not allowing Basic as the language for the course.

Garland used SBASIC to teach the introductory course in computer science at Dartmouth, but rewrote his textbook for the course in Pascal so that it could be used to teach the AP course.

===Seventh Edition===
Garland&#x27;s SBASIC was a pre-compiler written in SBASIC source code itself. The system would read SBASIC source, write the corresponding 6th Edition code, and then compile that output. The Seventh Edition, released in 1980, was a version of SBASIC that was a stand-alone compiler of its own. It added a number of additions of its own. Most of the changes were further elaborations on the system for calling external programs and &quot;overlays&quot; that could be used to break up a program into parts. In this version, codice_78s sharing a single file effectively shared data between them. This provided a modicum of data hiding within the group of routines. This separation would today be known as a module.

In addition, this edition added structured error handling and arbitrary matrix math in codice_3 statements, so one could codice_80 where M was a matrix variable, and the statement would output another matrix into A with all the elements in M scaled by 4. Finally, another major update was the use of activation records for subroutines which made recursion possible.

===ANSI BASIC, Eighth Edition=== 
By the early 1970s, the number of BASIC implementations had grown to dozens, all of which had their own changes to the basic concept introduced in the original version. Most of these were based on the Fifth Edition, although they often lacked the MAT instructions and the ability to indent code. GE was one of these companies; they released their Mark II systems with the 5th edition rather than waiting for the 6th to arrive a few months later. BASIC-PLUS on the DEC platform was perhaps the closest implementation, including the MAT commands for instance, but then added a number of changes that were not backward-compatible.

After the release of the 6th edition, Kurtz became involved in an effort to define a standard BASIC. An American National Standards Institute (ANSI) working group, X3J2, formed in January 1974, and a corresponding European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) group, TC21, that September. The goal at that time was to produce two related standards. Minimal BASIC would be similar to the Second Edition, but adding strings, a standard to which practically every BASIC would already be able to conform. Standard BASIC would add more functionality to produce something more in keeping with the real BASIC varieties seen in the market.

The process was slow, and the first draft of Minimal BASIC was not published until January 1976, leading to it being officially adopted in December 1977 by ECMA, and 1979 by ANSI as X3.60-1978. Minimal BASIC was similar to the 3rd edition, including string variables, while lacking MAT and other advanced features. In contrast, Standard BASIC had many new features that did not exist in other BASICs, and many of these were poorly considered and the subject of some criticism. For instance, the standard included a line-continuation character, but chose the ampersand, , which was also used for string concatenation. Using these in a single line could lead to very confusing code.

By this time, the release of the first microcomputer systems in 1975 had quickly led to the introduction of Altair BASIC, the first version of what would soon be known as Microsoft BASIC. MS BASIC was patterned on BASIC-PLUS, and thus ultimately the Fifth Edition, but lacked indenting, MAT, and other features. It also added the codice_81 and codice_82 functions, breaking the three-letter convention. As the number of microcomputers grew, and turned into the home computer market in the late 1970s, MS BASIC became the &quot;de facto&quot; standard.

With this rapid change in the market, the Standard BASIC effort slowed further and was not formally ratified until 1987 as X3.113-1987. By this time, there was no real purpose to the standards; not only was MS BASIC everywhere, but by the mid-1980s the use of BASIC was declining as shrinkwrap software took over from type-in programs. Both standards were eventually withdrawn.

In spite of the eventual failure of the ANSI efforts, the draft of Standard BASIC was implemented at Dartmouth as the Eighth Edition in 1982.

==DTSS interface==
DTSS implemented an early integrated development environment (IDE): an interactive command line interface. This provided a number of user and job control commands. For instance, an idle terminal could be connected to a user account by typing codice_83, and logged out again with codice_84.

Any line typed in by the user, and beginning with a line number, was added to the program, replacing any previously stored line with the same number; anything else was assumed to be a DTSS command and immediately executed. Lines which consisted solely of a line number were not stored but did remove any previously stored line with the same number. This method of editing was necessary due to the use of teleprinters as the terminal units.

Each user account could have any number of BASIC programs stored offline, while administrator accounts could also leave programs in permanent storage. Any one of these was active at a given time for a given user account, and if no program had been loaded, a new program was assumed. Stored programs were accessed using commands that are today better known as parts of the BASIC language itself; for instance, the codice_85 command instructed DTSS to print out the currently active program.

===List of commands===
; codice_83 : log in to DTSS
; codice_84 : log out of DTSS
; codice_88 : start BASIC mode
; codice_89 : name and begin writing a program
; codice_90 : retrieve a previously named program from permanent storage
; codice_85 : display the current program
; codice_1 : execute the current program
; codice_31 : interrupt the currently running program
; codice_94 : use an instructor-provided program to test the current program 
; codice_95 : execute the current program in a multiple-terminal mode
; codice_96 : join a program being executed in multiple-terminal mode
; codice_97 : save the current program in permanent storage
; codice_98 : clear the current program from permanent storage
; codice_99 : save the current program using a name already in use for another file
; codice_100 : display the names of programs in permanent storage
; codice_101 : erase the current program without clearing its name
; codice_102 : change the name of the current program without erasing it
; codice_103 : enable Friden mode for teletypes with mechanical linefeeds
; codice_104 : disable Friden mode
; codice_105 : explain (help) EXP EXP for list of commands that can be explained by the system

The commands were often believed to be part of the BASIC language by users, but, in fact, were part of the time sharing system and were also used when preparing ALGOL or FORTRAN programs via the DTSS terminals.

===TEACH/Test System===

Some 80% of all Dartmouth students in the late 1960s took two mathematics courses and learned Basic in the second course, either in calculus or in finite mathematics. They received two one-hour lectures on Basic near the beginning of these courses and then had to write four programs in Basic, ranging from programs for approximating π or finding a root of a quintic polynomial to programs for solving a differential equation or finding (by simulation) the limiting probability in a Markov chain. The TEACH/Test system helped students complete these assignments. When they thought they had a working program, they typed the command TEST, and an instructor-written program either approved what they had written or provided a hint about where they might have gone wrong. Students were required to hand in a listing of each program, a sample RUN, and an approval from the TEACH/Test system. The system did not grade assignments or keep a record of how many times a student typed TEST; it simply assisted students and their instructors.

==BASIC language==
The first release implemented the following statement types, taking some of its operators and keywords from FORTRAN II and some from ALGOL 60. Overall, the language more closely follows the FORTRAN model, in that it generally has one statement per line of code, lacks ALGOL&#x27;s &quot;blocks&quot; to group code (these structured programming constructs were a primary reason for ALGOLs development) and the use of GOTO to control program flow.

From ALGOL it took the codice_106 style loops that replaced FORTRAN&#x27;s unwieldy codice_107 statements. BASIC also simplified the codice_9 construct to allow simple comparisons like , as opposed to FORTRAN&#x27;s codice_109. FORTRAN&#x27;s style &quot;computed IF&quot; was reintroduced with the codice_34 command in later versions.

Variable names were limited to A to Z, A0 to A9, B0 to B9, ..., Z0 to Z9, giving a maximum of 286 possible distinct variables. FORTRAN&#x27;s odd system for setting up the variables I through N as integers and the rest as floating point was removed, and all variables were assumed to be floating point and dimensioned with up to 10 elements. The codice_13 command was only required if the array held more than ten elements. Array names were restricted to A to Z only.

===List of BASIC statements===
; codice_10 : define single line functions
; codice_13 : (short for &quot;dimension&quot;) define the size of arrays
; codice_5 : define the end of the program
; codice_31 : stop a program before the textual end
; codice_116 : define loops
; codice_117 : mark the end of loops
; codice_118 : transfer control to simple subroutines
; codice_119 : return control from simple subroutines
; codice_120 : transfer control to another statement
; codice_121 : decision making
; codice_122 : assign formula results to a variable
; codice_4 : output results
; codice_12 : store static data within the program
; codice_11 : input data stored in DATA statements
; codice_14 : comment (&quot;REMark&quot;)

It also implemented floating-point numeric variables and arithmetic.

===List of functions===
; codice_127 : Absolute value
; codice_128 : Arctangent value (result in radians)
; codice_129 : Cosine value (argument in radians)
; codice_105 : Exponential value
; codice_20 : Integer value
; codice_132 : Natural Logarithmic value
; codice_33 : Random value
; codice_134 : Sine value (argument in radians)
; codice_21 : Square root value
; codice_136 : Tangent value (argument in radians)

==Examples==
Early versions of BASIC did not have the ability to read and write external files. To represent lists of data that would normally be read from a file, BASIC included the codice_12 keyword, which could be followed by an arbitrarily long list of elements, ending only at the limit of the line length. The codice_12 was non-executable and was skipped if encountered. codice_11 commands would consume the data one by one, keeping track of its location within the complete collection of codice_12 elements in an internal pointer. In version 3, a codice_26 command was added to reset the pointer to the first codice_12 command in a program.

In this example, &quot;the first three data values are read into X, Y, and Z respectively. The value -1 is read into N. The next 11 values, .1 through .3, are read into the 11 elements of array B.&quot;
15 READ X, Y, Z
20 READ N
24 FOR I=0 TO 10
25 READ B(I)
26 NEXT I
40 DATA 4.2, 7.5, 25.1, -1, .1, .01, .001, .0001
45 DATA .2, .02, .002, .0002, .015, .025, .3, .03, .003
Unlike most subsequent BASICs, Dartmouth BASIC, from the Third Edition onwards, had a matrix keyword, codice_2, which could prefix a number of other commands to operate on entire arrays of data with a single command. In this example, from the 1968 manual, codice_144 is used to input a series of variables. When the user enters nothing on a line, this process ends and the total number of elements is accessed in the codice_145 pseudovariable. The code then adds up all of the individual elements in the matrix and calculates the average. The Third Edition also added indentation, which is used here to clarify the loop structure.
5 LET S = 0 
10 MAT INPUT V 
20 LET N = NUM 
30 IF N = 0 THEN 99 
40 FOR I = 1 TO N 
45 LET S = S + V(I) 
50 NEXT I 
60 PRINT S/N 
70 GO TO 5 
99 END

<doc id="516846" wikidata="Q972316" url="?curid=516846" title="Dugout (baseball)">
<text>In baseball, the dugout is a team&#x27;s bench and is located in foul territory between home plate and either first or third base. There are two dugouts, one for the home team and one for the visiting team. In general, the dugout is occupied by all players not prescribed to be on the field at that particular time, as well as coaches and other personnel authorized by the league. The players&#x27; equipment (gloves, bats, batting helmets, catcher&#x27;s equipment, etc.) is usually stored in the dugout.

In baseball, the manager, with the help of his assistants, will dictate offensive strategy from the dugout by sending hand signals to the first and third base coaches. To avoid detection, the first and third base coaches will then translate those hand signals into their own set of hand signals and then send them on to the batter and runners.

==Origin==
The term &quot;dugout&quot; refers to the area being slightly depressed below field level, as is common in professional baseball. The prevailing theory of the origin of locating the dugouts below field level is that it allowed spectators seated behind the dugouts to see the field, specifically the home plate area. Unlike most other sports, the primary action in baseball is centered on one area – home plate – and obstructing this area from fans&#x27; view, even if by players on the bench, would not be popular with fans.

Not all dugouts are located below the field level. At the major league level, the few dugouts that are located at the field level are in multi-purpose stadiums to simplify the conversion from baseball configuration to another sports field configuration. At such ballparks, the seating area is raised such that the dugouts do not obstruct the spectators&#x27; view. Dugouts are also at field level at most amateur ballparks, where locating them below field level would be cost prohibitive or otherwise not beneficial. In these cases, the term &quot;dugout&quot; still applies, as does &quot;bench.&quot; In the early days of professional baseball, the seating areas were often constructed high enough that the bench was at field level.

==Variations==
Most professional and collegiate ballparks feature dugouts that are below the field level, with concrete steps along the entire length of the dugout. Some feature a railing along the top step, or &quot;lip&quot;, while others are open.

In most Major League Baseball ballparks, as well as many minor league ballparks, the dugout is directly connected to the clubhouse by a tunnel.

Most high school, Little League, and recreational ballparks feature dugouts that are at the field level, usually separated from the playing field by chain-link fencing.

Historic Cardines Field in Newport, Rhode Island, home of the Newport Gulls, features both dugouts on the first base side.

==Official rules==
MLB rule 3.17 specifies that &quot;no one except players, substitutes, managers, coaches, athletic trainers and batboys shall occupy a bench during a game.&quot; The rule also stipulates that players on the injured list are allowed in the dugout, but may not enter the field of play at any time during the game. Players and coaches who have been ejected from the game may not remain in the dugout per Rule 4.07.

Unlike most other sports, where a ball or puck entering a team&#x27;s bench area has already passed out of bounds and is thus dead before it reaches the bench, it is possible in baseball for a dugout to be a factor in play. MLB rule 6.05(a) states that a fielder may reach into a dugout to catch a fly ball as long as one or both feet is on or over the playing field, and does not have a foot on the ground in the dugout when making the catch. MLB universal ground rules state that the player may subsequently enter the dugout after making the catch if his momentum is carrying him that way, but if he falls in the dugout as a result, the catch is allowed but baserunners advance in accordance with Rule 7.04(c).

A live ball entering a dugout becomes dead and the batter-runner and any base runners advance in accordance with Rule 7.04(c). However, a live ball bouncing off a dugout railing, if present, is still in play (unless a foul ball). Due to the dugouts&#x27; location in foul territory, live balls entering dugouts usually only occur after an errant throw by the defensive team.

==Dugout choice in MLB==

Which team occupies the dugout on the first-base side or the third-base side is purely arbitrary. The Major League Baseball Rulebook is silent on the subject. In the past, the manager also served as the third base coach, so occupying the third base dugout meant less walking for the manager between innings. Contrarily, the thought is that since more close plays occur at first base than third, the first base dugout is preferred. For a pre-existing facility, the home team might choose the better clubhouse and the dugout on that side of the field. (For example, prior to their 2008 move to Nationals Park, the Washington Nationals occupied the third-base dugout at RFK Stadium because it was the larger and newer of the two dugouts.) Another factor can be the sun angle during day games. In ballparks where one of the dugouts faces direct sunlight for much of the game, which can be problematic on hot summer days, the home club might choose the dugout that is better shaded.

In both the National League and American League, more home team dugouts are on the first-base side (9 to 6 each). Even the two oldest parks still in use differ on this point: the Cubs sit on the third-base side at Wrigley while the Red Sox inhabit the first-base dugout at Fenway. Due to the ballpark&#x27;s orientation, at Wrigley the third-base dugout faces away from the sun from noon onward, whereas the first base dugout faces sunlight in the late innings. At Fenway, the third-base dugout faces the sun for part of a day game, while the first-base dugout remains shaded.

<text>In Judaism, Lifnei Iver (, &quot;Before the Blind&quot;) is a Hebrew expression defining a prohibition against misleading people by use of a &quot;stumbling block,&quot; or allowing a person to proceed unawares in unsuspecting danger or culpability. The origin comes from the commandment &quot;Before the blind, do not put a stumbling block&quot; ().

The Hebrew term &quot;lifnei iver&quot; is one of the offenses which the Talmud argues to be punishable by excommunication in Judaism.

The stumbling block as a distinct, and negative, concept is also established in Christian theology: in the Catholic Church, it is known as creating &quot;scandal&quot;.

==Biblical context==
The regulation appears among a brief miscellany of regulations concerning ethical behaviour, covering issues such as consideration of the deaf, an &quot;evil tongue&quot;, not bearing grudges, the impartiality of justice, and leaving gleanings for the poor demonstrate similar concerns against exploiting individuals, but focus on different issues.

==In Jewish oral law==
Many halakhic principles are derived from &quot;lifnei iver&quot;, the oral Torah expanding its ramifications beyond a purely literal interpretation. In classical rabbinical literature, &quot;lifnei iver&quot; is seen as a figuratively expressed prohibition against misleading people; the Sifra (a midrash from the time of the Mishnah) argues that since the recipient of advice would be metaphorically &quot;blind&quot; in regard to its accuracy, they would metaphorically &quot;stumble&quot; if the advice was damaging or otherwise bad.

The Talmud extends the principle to also prohibit the facilitation of a sinful act by another individual, where the person in question would otherwise have lacked the opportunity or means to have committed the sin; for example, the Talmud takes the regulation to prohibit the giving of a cup of wine to someone who has taken the nazirite vow (which includes a vow to not partake in wine or grape products). The Talmud expresses caution in regard to figurative interpretations of this principle, emphasising that the law only really covers those situations where the other individual could not possibly have committed the transgression without the aid of the first person violating the &quot;lifnei iver&quot; rule; this is known in the Talmud as &quot;two sides to the river&quot; (&quot;Trei Ivrah deNaharah&quot;)—if, for example, the person who took a nazirite vow had been about to take a glass of wine anyway, then handing them a glass of wine would not transgress &quot;lifnei iver&quot;. Examples of Lifnei iver: as Amnon had sought the advice of Jonadab in order to rape his half sister Tamar, Absalom had sought the advice of Ahitophel who advised Absalom to have incestuous relations with his father&#x27;s concubines in order to show all Israel how odious he was to his father [2 Samuel 16:20].

&quot;Lifnei iver&quot; as a principle recurs many times in more practical applications of Jewish law. For example, the Shulchan Aruch, an authoritative codification of Jewish Law (Halacha), warns a father to not physically chastise older children, as this will only entice them to hit back, which in its view would be a capital offence (Shulchan Aruch &quot;Yoreh Deah&quot; 240:20).

==Academic perspectives==
According to the editors of the 1906 &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, the prevailing notion in ancient Middle Eastern cultures was that bodily ailments and defects, such as blindness and loss of hearing, as well as circumstantial ailments, such as poverty, were punishments for sin; the blind, together with cripples and lepers, were outcast by society and were prevented from entering towns, becoming paupers as a result. The biblical provision of laws to protect individuals afflicted in this manner would have had the effect, perhaps intended, of reducing the prejudice they suffered.

<text>Thomas Ollis Hicks Sr. (born February 7, 1946), is an American private equity investor and sports team owner living in Dallas, Texas. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine estimated Hicks&#x27; wealth at $1 billion in 2009, but it dropped to $700 million in 2010. Hicks co-founded the investment firm, Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst, previously owned 50% of the English football club Liverpool F.C., and is chairman of Hicks Holdings LLC, which owns and operates Hicks Sports Group, the company that formerly owned the Texas Rangers, the Dallas Stars, and the Mesquite Championship Rodeo. In 2010, Hicks was forced to sell the Rangers and Liverpool to satisfy his creditors, and the Stars went into bankruptcy the following year.

==Biography==
The son of a Texas radio station owner, Hicks was born in Port Arthur, Texas, and graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School, in Port Arthur, in 1964. Hicks received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in finance from the University of Texas in 1968, and received his MBA from the University of Southern California in 1970. He is a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon social fraternity.

Hicks became interested in leveraged buyouts as a member of First National Bank of Dallas&#x27;s venture capital group. Hicks and Robert Haas formed Hicks &amp; Haas in 1984. The next year that firm bought Hicks Communications, a radio outfit run by Hicks&#x27; brother Steven – the first of several media companies bought or created by the buyout firm that involved Steven (Capstar, Chancellor, and AMFM).

Hicks &amp; Haas&#x27; in the mid-1980s bought several soft drink makers, including Dr Pepper and 7 Up. The firm took Dr Pepper/7 Up public just 18 months after merging the two companies. In all, Hicks &amp; Haas turned $88 million of investor funding into $1.3 billion. The pair went their separate ways in May 1989. He wanted to raise large pools to invest, while Haas preferred to work with investors deal by deal.

In 1989, Hicks co-founded the investment firm, Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst with former Prudential Securities banker John Muse. The firm raised $250 million, with early investments including a life insurance company, Life Partners Group (bought in 1990 and sold in 1996). In 1991, Morgan Stanley&#x27;s Charles Tate and First Boston&#x27;s Jack Furst became partners. Hicks was chairman from 1989 to 2004, Hicks Muse raised $12 billion of private equity funds, consummated over $50 billion of leveraged acquisitions, and grew to become one of the largest private investment firms in the country.

But Hicks Muse hit a rough patch by the early 2000s, when investors in Equity Fund IV were burned by a $1.2 billion plunge into telecom investments in 1999. Hicks announced that he would leave the Hicks Muse on March 8, 2004, to spend more time with his family and his sports teams. (Hicks Muse was subsequently renamed HM Capital Partners.) He has remained active in his own ventures. He created Hicks Holdings, a vehicle for his sports and real estate empire, and then started buying companies again in the $10 to $250 million level, including: a Chinese electronics firm, a venture with DirecTV selling bundled TV-telecom services to condos, a landscaping materials company in the Midwest, a pet food firm in Argentina, and Gammaloy – an oil field rental outfit he bought from his wife&#x27;s family, paying approximately $20 million in the 1990s.

Additionally, he formed Hicks Acquisition Company I, Inc. (HACI). In September 2009, HACI merged into Resolute Energy Corporation (REN), an oil and gas firm. Hicks does not sit on REN&#x27;s board of directors, but his son, Thomas O. Hicks, Jr., represents HACI on the board.

As of August 13, 2010, the website for Hicks Sports Group appears to have disappeared. As for other websites for Hicks companies, while they are still operating, they appear to be empty of any data and Hicks Sports Marketing now appears to be a Word Press blog site, with the first page advertising Online Gaming.

==Politics==
Hicks was a member of the political action committee for the 2008 presidential election campaign for former Republican Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani.

Hicks was previously neighbors with former U.S. President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush. Each neighbor’s property shared a boundary between Daria Place and Holloway Road, within a gated community of Preston Hollow, Dallas, Texas respectively.

==Tom Hicks Elementary School==
Tom Hicks Elementary School in Frisco, Texas, part of the Lewisville Independent School District, was given its name after Hicks donated the land for the school.

==Sports==
Hicks moved from the business pages to the sports section in December 1995 when he bought the National Hockey League Dallas Stars for $82 million.

===Dallas Stars===
Hicks contracted to purchase the National Hockey League (NHL) franchise from Norman Green in December 1995. During his tenure as owner of the club, Hicks was the Stars&#x27; Chairman of the Board and the club&#x27;s representative on the NHL Board of Governors. Hicks played an instrumental role in the development and planning of American Airlines Center. Under his ownership, the Stars won seven division titles, two Western Conference crowns, two Presidents&#x27; Trophies (as the team with the best regular season record), two consecutive trips to the Stanley Cup Finals and the 1999 Stanley Cup championship. In April 2010, Hicks&#x27; company defaulted on $525 million in bank loans backed by the Stars and a 50% interest in the American Airlines Center.

On September 13, 2011, lenders voted to agree to have the Stars file for bankruptcy and sold at auction.

On November 22, 2011, a bankruptcy court judge approved a bid by Vancouver businessman and Kamloops Blazers owner Tom Gaglardi to buy the team for $240 million.

===Texas Rangers===
In June 1998, Hicks bought the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball’s American League from an investment group managed by George W. Bush. Under Hicks&#x27; ownership, the Rangers won the American League West Division crown in 1998 and 1999, but failed to deliver a World Series. Hicks made headlines across all MLB when he personally negotiated and signed shortstop Alex Rodriguez to the biggest contract in MLB history at that time; a ten-year, $252 million deal at the December 2000 winter meetings. That contract, however, severely limited the Rangers&#x27; ability to sign other players, and they would have only two more winning seasons during Hicks&#x27; ownership. Years later, Hicks pointed to the blockbuster contract as &quot;one of his biggest regrets&quot;.

The Rangers also spent a large amount of money on Chan Ho Park, who signed a $65 million contract with the Rangers following the 2001 season. The Park signing would be a disaster for the Rangers as the new &quot;staff ace&quot; was unable to adjust to the move from pitcher-friendly Dodger Stadium to the hitter-friendly American League. After finishing in last place for the division three consecutive seasons with Rodriguez, Hicks agreed to trade to the New York Yankees before the 2004 season. As part of the agreement, the Rangers would supplement a portion of his remaining contract. This agreement would continue until Rodriguez opted out of his contract in 2007. On January 23, 2010, it was announced Hicks had agreed to sell the Rangers to a group led by Chuck Greenberg and Nolan Ryan. Hicks would have been a minority share holder in the new ownership group.

Prior to bids being placed by potential buyers, Hicks told the media the Rangers were operating under normal business with no interference from MLB. Regarding the Rangers&#x27; inability to sign 2009 first round pick Matt Purke, he said, &quot;We were disappointed that the family insisted on $6 million. The Texas Rangers were not willing to do that. It had nothing to do with MLB restrictions. There is a clear misimpression we didn&#x27;t sign Matt Purke because MLB wouldn&#x27;t let us. That&#x27;s not true. We didn&#x27;t because of Tom Hicks, Nolan Ryan and Jon Daniels. We were not willing to go to $6 million.&quot; After his group had completed the purchase agreement, Ryan told the media the Rangers were unable to offer the first round pick the $6 million signing bonus both parties had verbally agreed upon after the draft because MLB, who were strictly overseeing the Rangers budget by this time, would not approve the amount needed to sign Purke. After the announcement of the pending sale by Hicks Sports Group (HSG), several additional hurdles occurred which had to be remedied before the sale of the team could be finalized. Several of the lenders, who were owed over $500 million, vocally objected to the deal accusing Hicks of rejecting a higher offer by Jim Crane and stated they would not sign off on the deal. Hicks has been sued by three different parties over the land adjacent to the stadium that was sold in a separate transaction as a part of the purchase by Greenberg and Ryan.

On May 24, 2010, HSG filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection/separation of the Texas Rangers from HSG and asked the courts to approve of the sale of the Rangers to the group headed by Greenberg and Ryan. The move was made to expedite the sale and resolve the sale prior to the MLB trade deadline and draft signing deadline. Ironically, Alex Rodriguez was the largest unsecured creditor, owed nearly $25 million in deferred payments despite being traded six years earlier.

Emails presented in court show that after Hicks agreed to an exclusive negotiation period with Greenberg attorneys for HSG were still in discussion with another bidder, Dennis Crane, about a sale price for the team and emailed the creditors on December 31, 2009 saying, &quot;Basically, the response from the MLB was to prohibit us from negotiating with anyone other than Greenberg. Their intent seems to be to lock us into Greenberg even though Crane now has a clearly superior economic deal – and may always have had based on Greenberg&#x27;s current position. We need help here. Unless the lenders weigh in, we are going to be stuck negotiating a deal that is clearly worse than Crane&#x27;s.&quot;

The bankruptcy court ordered a public auction to be held on August 4, 2010, and the winning bid was submitted by Greenberg/Ryan. Co-lead investors Ray Davis and Bob R. Simpson were named co-chairmen.

In March 2011, Greenberg resigned as chief executive, sold his interest, and Nolan Ryan was named president and chief executive officer. Ryan was subsequently designated the controlling owner of the club by a unanimous vote of the 30 owners of Major League Baseball on May 12, 2011.

===Cruzeiro and Corinthians===
In 1999, Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst entered into a partnership with Cruzeiro Esporte Clube and Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, two popular Brazilian football clubs. Club directors and Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst assured the fans that a new stadium was in development, but this never materialized.

In 2003, after legal/financial troubles and partner infighting, Hicks retired from the company and the ownership group eventually left the partnership with Corinthians. There was no new stadium.

===Liverpool F.C.===

On February 1, 2007, it was made known through the English press that he was involved in a consortium with one-time friend and Montreal Canadiens owner George N. Gillett Jr. to purchase English Premier League club Liverpool F.C.; this takeover proposal was believed to be the front-runner after Dubai International Capital (DIC) withdrew their bid. On February 6, 2007, Hicks and Gillett&#x27;s joint offer for Liverpool was formally accepted, valuing the club at £218.9 million ($432.9M) (£5,000 per share and £44.8M in debt). Liverpool became the third Premier League club to be acquired by American businessmen, the others being Aston Villa and Manchester United. When taking over the club, Hicks and Gillett made a joint declaration: &quot;Liverpool is a fantastic club with a remarkable history and a passionate fanbase. We fully acknowledge and appreciate the unique heritage and rich history of Liverpool and intend to respect this heritage in the future.&quot; Hicks stated his foremost priority was gaining silverware, and vowed to build a new stadium for the club at Stanley Park Stadium. The preexisting plans to build the stadium were revised but the stadium never materialized.

Hicks became extremely unpopular among Liverpool fans for his failure to deliver on the promise of a new stadium or on the promise that no debt would be placed onto the club and for his allegedly misleading statements about planned and past investment in players. During Hicks and Gillett&#x27;s period of ownership, Liverpool became associated with frequent boardroom wranglings as the owners fell out with each other and engaged in public battles with Parry and Benítez. Anger was also directed at the Hicks family when Tom Hicks&#x27; son, Thomas O. Hicks, Jr., had to resign from the Liverpool board of directors after sending an abusive e-mail to a Liverpool fan saying, &quot;Blow me fuck face. Go to hell. I&#x27;m sick of you.&quot;

On January 22, 2008, a majority of Liverpool fans at the game between Liverpool and Aston Villa protested against Gillett and Hicks&#x27; running of the club, urging the pair to sell their shares in Liverpool to Dubai International Capital (DIC). Neither owner, nor their representative Foster Gillett, was present at the game. George Gillett was reportedly targeted by DIC to sell his shares. It was reported that he had fallen out with Hicks and he subsequently kept silent over his dealings with the club. On March 7, 2008, it was reported that Gillett had agreed to sell 98% of his Liverpool stock to DIC, but Hicks blocked the sale. In an interview on Prime Time Sports in Canada, Gillett revealed that he and his family had received death threats from angry Liverpool fans: &quot;The fans don&#x27;t want him [Tom Hicks] to have even one share of my stake in the club, based on what they are sending to me. As a result of that we [my family] have received many phone calls in the middle of the night threatening our lives, death threats. A number came to the office and my son, Foster, and daughter-in-law, Lauren, have received them.&quot; On April 16, 2010, the club was put up for sale. Hicks claimed that he believed the club had tripled in value during his tenure, and boasted that he would be looking for a price of four times what he purchased his stake for. He claimed that, &quot;Liverpool will be the most profitable investment I&#x27;ve ever made.&quot; On June 16, 2010, Liverpool Walton MP Steve Rotheram tabled a motion in the House of Commons expressing dismay at the continuing ownership of the club. Hicks and Gillett were described as &quot;asset strippers&quot; and the club was being &quot;drained by their greed&quot;.

In October 2010, as part of a fans&#x27; campaign against the ownership, a video entitled &quot;Dear Mr Hicks&quot; was released virally via YouTube. Produced and directed by Mike Jefferies, it featured celebrity fans of the club giving their reasons why they wanted to see a change of ownership. &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper praised the video, saying, &quot;True to the city&#x27;s capacity to create something out of adversity, a wonderfully inventive viral film, Dear Mr Hicks, has been published online to make it clear where he ought to go. The fans&#x27; view can be summarised thus: away, and soon.&quot;
It was claimed that the video was watched 400 000 times in 42 hours.

On October 15, 2010, Hicks lost ownership of Liverpool. Despite numerous attempts to prevent it, the club was sold to New England Sports Ventures (NESV), for a fee believed to be around £300 million, which was far below Hicks&#x27; valuation of &quot;between £600M and £1 billion (B)&quot;, by the club&#x27;s board of directors in a 3–2 vote. Hicks is pursuing a (max.) £1 billion suit against NESV and Kop Holdings for damages, claiming that, &quot;This outcome... devalues the club...&quot; and suggesting that he had been the victim of an &quot;epic swindle&quot;. From the time the club had been put up for sale, however, it had been widely reported that the fee that Hicks and Gillett were asking for was unlikely to be achieved. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; pointed out that the asking price of £600–800 million took no account of the fact that a new owner would have to spend £375 million building the new stadium which Hicks and Gillett had promised and failed to deliver. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; suggested that Hicks and Gillett were unlikely to achieve their estimated price because everyone knew that there was huge debt at the club and that these debts were due to be called in very shortly, meaning that the bankers would subsequently put the club into administration and then sell off the club at a bargain price anyway. The likelihood of the club being placed in administration increased once, on September 7, 2010, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Hicks&#x27;s main creditor, placed the Texan&#x27;s indebtedness in the toxic debt category as he was considered unable to find refinancing or to pay off the debt. In the end, none of the offers made were anywhere close to Hicks and Gillett&#x27;s valuation and with the threat of administration looming the club was sold for £300 million. This meant that the sale in 2010 fetched £80 million more than Hicks and Gillett had paid for the club in 2007, but because more than £200 million worth of debt had been piled on to the club, resulting in huge interest rates and penalty payments, the outgoing owners ended up losing an estimated £144 million on their investment.

Liverpool fans were delighted to hear that the club had been sold. Steve Horner, from the fans&#x27; group Kop Faithful, declared,
&quot;It’s like a huge cloud has been lifted off us... Hicks and Gillett leave with no legacy, apart from one of chaos.&quot; The chairman of Liverpool Supporters Club, Richie Pedder, announced to the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;, &quot;This is the start of a new era. A lot has been taken off the club’s shoulders now. Good riddance to Hicks and Gillett.&quot; Former Liverpool player Tommy Smith expressed his joy at the departure of Hicks and Gillett in his regular newspaper column: &quot;But today they are out of our club – and I’m as happy as every one of the Liverpool fans who’ve made it clear they’re so sick of them. All they were ever interested in was making money – not in owning what is for me the greatest football club in the world, investing in it properly and taking good care of it. Good riddance.&quot; After selling the club, Hicks admitted that his relationship with the fans had been strained: &quot;Something went wrong with my ability to communicate with the fans. I am saddened by it.&quot;

In the two years before Hicks and Gillett took control of the club, Liverpool won the UEFA Champions League in 2005 and the FA Cup in 2006 under manager Rafael Benítez. In the three-and-a-half years in which Hicks and Gillett owned the club, they won not a single trophy, and at the time they left Liverpool, the club were in the relegation zone of the Premier League standings. Hicks denied this claim, declaring that during his reign Liverpool&#x27;s net spend on player transfers was £150 million (sometimes cited as $150 million). &quot;The Sunday Mirror&quot; calculated that the net spend probably did not exceed £25.1 million and has accused Hicks of &quot;creative accountancy&quot;, stating &quot;what is irrefutable is that Hicks has exaggerated the net spend by probably close to six fold&quot;.

During Hicks and Gillett&#x27;s period of ownership, the club struggled to meet the interest payments on the loans taken out as part of the leveraged buy-out. Christian Purslow, managing director of Liverpool since June 2009, publicly stated in September 2010 that the debt was an important burden for the club because it limited investment in players: &quot;The issue is that too much of that profit is being used to service loans put into place when the club was bought.&quot; Hicks admitted after the sale that the club&#x27;s debt was too great but argued that he had not been given sufficient time by his main creditor, the Royal Bank of Scotland, to repay the debt: &quot;It has a little bit too much debt, no question. But we were going to fix that and we were frustrated by others.&quot; He has also suggested that the Royal Bank of Scotland prevented him paying back the debt to them: &quot;I can&#x27;t go into the details but I can confirm the funds were available to pay off Royal Bank of Scotland entirely but between Royal Bank of Scotland, the chairman and the employees that conspired against us, they would not let us.&quot;

After more legal trouble with his other sports team, Hicks decided not to pursue his claims of a conspiracy against him. On January 11, 2013, Hicks and Gillett finally decided to drop their case in the English law courts against Sir Martin Broughton, Christian Purslow and Ian Ayre, the three directors on the club&#x27;s board of directors at the time of the sale of the club to NESV; they also agreed to drop their case against NESV and RBS Bank. The terms of the agreement are confidential, though it is believed that no monies were paid to Hicks or Gillett. Earlier in the week, Hicks and Gillett had lost a Court of Appeal bid to delay a High Court trial so they could have more time to raise the money needed to fund the multi-million pound lawsuit.

==Philanthropy==
In addition to donating the land for aforementioned school in Frisco, Hicks donated a gymnasium to the St. Mark&#x27;s School of Texas in Dallas. Hicks was also the 1996 co-chair of the Dallas Jewish Coalition for the Homeless &quot;Vogel Alcove&quot; project, and received the 2000 Henry Cohn Humanitarian Award from the Anti-Defamation League.

<text>The Gyeongui Line is a railway line between Seoul Station and Dorasan Station in Paju. Korail operates the Seoul Metropolitan Subway service between Seoul Station and Dorasan Station.

==History==
&quot;For the original line&#x27;s history and other information prior to 1945, see Gyeongui Line (1904–1945).&quot;

Originally the line continued to P&#x27;yŏngyang and Sinŭiju, where it connected to the South Manchuria Railway, linking the Korean railway system to the rest of Asia and Europe.

The Korean Empire intended to build the Gyeongui Line itself at the end of the 19th century, but a shortage of funding resulted in the project&#x27;s suspension. The Empire of Japan, which gained a concession to build the Gyeongbu Line from Busan to Seoul, also sought to gain control of the Gyeongui Line project as its continuation further north, recognizing the trunk route as a means to keep Korea under its influence. The line was also advanced for military considerations in expectation of a confrontation with Russia, which came in 1904 as the Russo-Japanese War. At the start of the war, Japan ignored Korea&#x27;s declaration of neutrality and transported troops to Incheon, and forced the Korean government to sign an agreement that gave Japan&#x27;s military control of railway projects if deemed necessary for military operations. Japan&#x27;s military began to build the Gyeongui Line, while troop bases were established in connection with the railway, the biggest of them next to the terminus of the line, Yongsan Station in Seoul.

Freight service on the entirety of the Gyeongui Line was started on April 3, 1906.

===Inter-Korea border===

After the division of Korea in 1945, trains stopped operating between the north and south halves of the country, meaning that southern trains probably terminated at Kaesŏng, which is now in North Korea but was at the time part of the US-administered southern zone. Northern trains would have terminated north of Kaesŏng.

After the end of the Korean War in 1953, southern trains were cut back to around Munsan (north of Seoul), with northern trains terminating at Kaesŏng. Around the same time, North Korea renamed the P&#x27;yŏngyang-Kaesŏng section of the line as the P&#x27;yŏngbu (&quot;P&#x27;yŏng&quot;yang + &quot;Bu&quot;san) Line and the P&#x27;yŏngyang-Sinŭiju section as the P&#x27;yŏngŭi (&quot;P&#x27;yŏng&quot;yang + Sin&quot;ŭi&quot;ju) Line. The DPRK sector is now 100% electrified, although the double track section spans only from Pyongyang to Sunan Airport.

Since the summit between the two Koreas in 2000, an effort has slowly been underway to reconnect the Gyeongui Line. Southern passenger service has been extended to Dorasan on the edge of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and tracks have been built across the DMZ itself. In October 2004, the Northern connection from the DMZ to Kaesŏng was finally completed. Simultaneous test runs along the rebuilt cross-border sections of both the Gyeongui Line and the Donghae Bukbu Line were set for May 25, 2006, but North Korean military authorities cancelled the plans a day ahead of the scheduled event. However, at a meeting held in Pyongyang, North Korea, on April 22, 2007, North and South Korea agreed to restart the project. On May 17, 2007, the first train, carrying North and South Korean delegations, travelled from Munsan Station in the South to Kaesong in the North. The first test run on the Donghae Bukbu Line took place at the same time. According to South Korean representatives, the North has agreed in principle to regular passenger and freight service along the two train lines. On 30 November 2018 an engineers&#x27; inspection train from South Korea crossed the border at Dorasan for an assessment, conducted jointly with North Korean officials, of the North&#x27;s Kaesong to Sinuiju (P&#x27;yŏngŭi) line, and rail routes northwards from Mount Kumgang.

===Upgrade===

Meanwhile, work began to upgrade the South Korean section for high-capacity commuter services. Between Seoul and Munsan, the line is converted into an electrified, double-tracked railway in a new, straighter, 48.6 km long alignment. Work began in November 1999, with a budget originally estimated at 1,970 billion won. The section from Digital Media City (DMC) to Munsan was finished on July 1, 2009. The remaining section will be mostly underground between Gajwa Station in northwestern Seoul to Yongsan Station in downtown Seoul. As of 2009, construction progress on the entire Seoul–Munsan section reached 74% of a total budget then estimated at 2,153.271 billion won. The section is to be finished by 2014 and the freed area on the surface was reconstructed into a park known as the Gyeongui Line Forest Park.

The line is to be further upgraded for , as part of a government strategic plan to reduce travel times for 95% of Korea to under 2 hours by 2020, which was announced on September 1, 2010.

The Gyeongui–Jungang Line (Munsan–Imjingang) extension opened on March 28, 2020.

==Services==

===DMZ-Train===
===Seoul Metropolitan Subway===

The Gyeongui Line opened as a part Seoul Metropolitan Subway on July 1, 2009 from Seoul to Munsan. The line connects Seoul, Digital Media City, Ilsan, Paju, and Munsan, and offers transfers to Line 3, Line 6, and AREX.

The main line terminated at Digital Media City Station when first opened, while a separate branch continued to Seoul Station. On December 15, 2012, the main line was extended to Gongdeok Station, providing transfers to Line 2 and Line 5. On December 27, 2014, the main line service was further extended to Yongsan Station from Gongdeok Station, and the service was renamed to the Gyeongui–Jungang Line following the merging of the line with the Jungang Line.

The term &quot;subway&quot; in reference to this line is somewhat of a misnomer, as the line runs underground for less than three percent of its length. The upgraded line simply follows alignment of the old line built 100 years ago. The outer portion of the line runs largely through countryside rice paddies, forests, and vegetable fields, and outside of Seoul rarely enters urbanized areas. It is mostly at-grade, and includes several at-grade crossings with local roads, where Korail employees stand by on duty to stop traffic.

===Regular rail service===
Before the integration with the subway system, the most common service on the line was a Tonggeun train service between Seoul and Imjingang, with one Saemaeul-ho train. Since the line was integrated with the Seoul Subway system, Tonggeun service had been restricted to a few stations in the north, from Munsan to Imjingang, with a few continuing on to Dorasan, near the North Korean border.

===KTX===
There is a depot for Korea Train Express (KTX) trains along the Gyeongui Line at Haengsin station. Some KTX services thus continue beyond Seoul respective Yongsan Station and terminate at Haengsin station.

The line may see more KTX service after the upgrade for 230 km/h considered in the government&#x27;s strategic plan for 2020.

==Stations==
This list does not include stations served only by Gyeongui-Jungang Line services.

<text>Félix-Gabriel Marchand (January 9, 1832 – September 25, 1900) was a journalist, author, notary and politician in Quebec, Canada. He was the 11th premier of Quebec from May 24, 1897, to September 25, 1900.

Born in what is Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec today, he was the son of Lt.-Colonel Gabriel Marchand (1780–1852) J.P., and Mary MacNider, a woman of the Anglican faith, daughter of John MacNider, 2nd Seigneur of Metis, Quebec. As a child, Marchand attended English schools and was taught in French at the age of 11. Fluently bilingual, Marchand became a journalist and writer. He became a notary and practised this profession for 45 years, but continued journalism and writing as well.

He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in the 1867 Quebec provincial election for the district of Saint-Jean and retained his seat for 33 years until his death. He was Leader of the Opposition from 1892 to 1897, and then won the 1897 election as leader of the Liberal Party.

As premier, Marchand attempted to create a Ministry of Education in 1898. At the time, education was entirely in the hands of the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church in the province. His legislation was passed by the Legislative Assembly (the lower chamber of Quebec&#x27;s legislature), but was defeated in the Legislative Council (the upper house). It was not until 1964 that a Ministry of Education was finally created in Quebec.

Félix-Gabriel Marchand was still in office when he died in 1900 in Quebec City. He is interred in the cimetière Notre-Dame-de-Belmont in Sainte-Foy, Quebec.

Dr. André Simard, husband of Marthe Simard, was his grandson.

<text>The Old Men at the Zoo is a novel written by Angus Wilson, first published in 1961 by Secker and Warburg and by Penguin books in 1964. It was adapted, with many changes – nuclear bombing of London, not present in the novel, is added – into a 1983 BBC Television serial by the scriptwriter Troy Kennedy Martin. The book deals with events before a nuclear attack on London during a (presumably) limited nuclear war, which results in the imposition of a later post-apocalyptic pan-European dystopian dictatorship, until rescue arrives for the prisoners at the zoo, transformed into a concentration camp.

<doc id="516901" wikidata="Q369889" url="?curid=516901" title="Etruscan shrew">
<text>The Etruscan shrew (Suncus etruscus), also known as the Etruscan pygmy shrew, white-toothed pygmy shrew and Savi’s pygmy shrew, is the smallest known extant mammal by mass, weighing only about on average. (The bumblebee bat is regarded as the smallest mammal by skull size and body length.)

The Etruscan shrew has a body length of about excluding the tail. It is characterized by very rapid movements and a fast metabolism, eating about 1.5–2 times its own body weight per day. It feeds on various small vertebrates and invertebrates, mostly insects, and can hunt individuals of the same size as itself. These shrews prefer warm and damp climates and are widely distributed in the belt between 10° and 45°N latitude stretching from Europe and North Africa to Malaysia. They are also found in the Maltese islands, situated in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. Although widespread and not threatened overall, they are generally uncommon and are endangered in some countries.

==Description==
The Etruscan shrew has a slender (not truncated) body, with a length between excluding the tail, which adds another . The body mass varies between and and is usually about . In comparison, the related greater white-toothed shrew can be twice as long and weighs four to five times more. The head is relatively large, with a long, mobile proboscis, and the hind limbs are relatively small. The ears are relatively large and protuberant. The Etruscan shrew has a very fast heart beating rate, up to 1511 beats/min (25 beats/s) and a relatively large heart muscle mass, 1.2% of body weight. The fur color on the back and sides is pale brown, but is light gray on the stomach. The fur becomes denser and thicker from fall through the winter. The shrew usually has 30 teeth, but the 4th upper intermediate tooth is very small (rudimentary), and is absent in some individuals. Near the mouth grow a dense array of short whiskers, which the shrew actively uses to search for prey, especially in the night. Dimorphism in body features between males and females is absent.

==Activity==
Etruscan shrews live alone except during mating periods. Their lifespan is estimated at typically around two years, but with a large uncertainty. They protect their territories by making chirping noises and signs of aggressiveness. They tend to groom themselves constantly when not eating, and are always moving when awake and not hiding. The hiding periods are short, and typically last less than half an hour. Clicking sounds are heard when these shrews are moving, which cease when they rest. The shrews are more active during the night when they make long trips; during the day, they stay near the nest or in a hiding place. They reach their maximum level of activity at dawn.

Due to its small size and consequent high surface-area-to-volume ratio, the Etruscan shrew is at a constant risk of hypothermia, and would quickly freeze to death if not for its extremely rapid metabolism. Its skeletal muscles contract at a rate of about 13 contractions/sec during respiration alone. In cold seasons and during shortages of food, the shrews lower their body temperatures down to about and enter a state of temporary hibernation to reduce energy consumption. Recovery from this state is accompanied by shivering at a frequency of 58 muscle contractions/sec. This induces heating at a rate of up to 0.83 °C/min, which is among the highest values recorded in mammals; the heart rate increases exponentially with time from 100 to 800–1200 beats/min, and the respiratory rate rises linearly from 50 to 600–800 breaths/min.

Etruscan shrews mate primarily from March to October, though they can be pregnant at any time of the year. Pairs usually form in the spring and may tolerate each other and their young for some time at the nest. The gestation period is 27–28 days, and they have 2–6 cubs per litter. Cubs are born naked and blind, weighing only . After their eyes open at 14 to 16 days old, they mature quickly. The mother usually moves the young when they are 9 to 10 days old, and if disturbed, she relocates them by leading them with her tail in a train-like formation, a behaviour known as &quot;caravanning&quot;, with each cub biting the tail of the one in front. The young Etruscan shrews are weaned at 20 days old. By three to four weeks of age, the young are independent and are soon sexually mature.

==Distribution==
The Etruscan shrew inhabits a belt extending between 10° and 40°N latitude across Eurasia. In Southern Europe, it has been found in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, France, North Macedonia, Malta, Montenegro, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Turkey, with unconfirmed reports in Andorra, Gibraltar and Monaco; it has been introduced by humans to some European islands, such as Canary Islands.

The shrew also occurs in North Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia) and around the Arabian Peninsula (Bahrain, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Syria, and Yemen including Socotra). In Asia, it was observed in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bhutan, China (Gengma County only), Burma, Georgia, India, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Laos, Malaysia (Malaysian part of Borneo island), Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Vietnam. There are unconfirmed reports of the Etruscan shrew in West and East Africa (Guinea, Nigeria, Ethiopia) and in Armenia, Brunei, Indonesia, Kuwait and Uzbekistan.

Overall the species is widespread and not threatened, but its density is generally lower than of the other shrews living in the area. In some regions it is rare, especially in Azerbaijan, Georgia, Jordan and Kazakhstan (included into the Red Book).

==Habitat==
The Etruscan shrew favors warm and damp habitats covered with shrubs, which it uses to hide from predators. Areas where open terrain such as grasslands and scrub meet deciduous forests are usually inhabited. It can be found at sea level but is usually confined to the foothills and lower belts of mountain ranges, though has been found up to above sea level. It colonizes riparian thickets along the banks of lakes and rivers, as well as human-cultivated areas (abandoned gardens, orchards, vineyards, olive groves and edges of fields). The shrew, however, avoids intensively cultivated areas, as well as dense forests and sand dunes. It is poorly adapted to digging burrows, so it arranges its nests in various natural shelters, crevices and others&#x27; uninhabited burrows. They frequent rocks, boulders, stone walls and ruins, darting quickly in and out between them.

==Hunting and feeding==
Because of its high ratio of surface area to body volume, the Etruscan shrew has an extremely fast metabolism and must eat 1.5–2.0 times its body weight in food per day. It feeds mostly on various invertebrates, including insects, larvae and earthworms, as well as the young of amphibians, lizards and rodents, and can hunt prey of nearly the same body size as itself. It prefers species with a soft, thin exoskeleton, so it avoids ants when given a choice. Grasshoppers, where common, are often regular prey. It kills large prey by a bite to the head and eats it immediately, but takes small insects back to its nest. When hunting, it relies mostly on its sense of touch rather than vision, and may even run into its food at night. 

==Predators and threats==
The largest threat to Etruscan shrews originates from human activities, particularly destruction of their nesting grounds and habitats as a result of farming. Etruscan shrews are also sensitive to weather changes, such as cold winters and dry periods. Major predators are birds of prey.

<text>The Main Event is an American series of professional wrestling television specials that were produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). &quot;The Main Event&quot; was a spin-off of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot; and was held only one time in a year (with the exception of 1990 where it was held twice) and was equivalent to today’s monthly pay-per-view (PPV) events.
Like &quot;Saturday Night’s Main Event&quot;, &quot;The Main Event&quot; aired late and held its main event match on the first hour of the show. 
There were five shows between 1988 and 1991. Only the first three &quot;The Main Event&quot; episodes were shown live on NBC. The final two were taped and then shown on NBC at a later date. It included mainly high-card wrestlers of the WWF including Hulk Hogan, André the Giant, &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage, The Ultimate Warrior and &quot;Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase.

All episodes of &quot;The Main Event&quot; are available on the WWE Network, included with &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot;.

== Dates and venues ==
==Results==

===The Main Event===

The Main Event took place, and aired live, on Friday February 5, 1988 at 8pm ET at Market Square Arena in Indianapolis, Indiana. The live broadcast drew a 15.2 Nielsen rating and 33 million viewers, both records for American televised wrestling.

The match between André the Giant and Hulk Hogan saw André receive a pinfall victory despite Hogan raising his left shoulder before a count of two could be reached. It was revealed, post-match, that the referee who worked the match was not the assigned referee, Dave Hebner, but rather his twin brother, Earl Hebner. Earl had been hired by Ted DiBiase to cheat Hogan out of the belt. Immediately after the match, André surrendered the title to DiBiase. Later on, WWF President Jack Tunney said the title can only change hands by pinfall or submission. Tunney acknowledged that the referee&#x27;s decision is final but, due to André surrendering the belt, he declared the title to be vacant. Following the vacancy, a single elimination tournament was held at WrestleMania IV to crown the new champion.

The Strike Force vs. The Hart Foundation match was still in progress when NBC signed off. In 2014, when the WWE Network made available this episode to its on-demand section, the ending of the match was added in.

===The Main Event II===

The Main Event II took place and aired live on Friday February 3, 1989 at 8pm ET from the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The live broadcast drew an 11.6 rating and 19.9 million viewers.

The slowly building tension between Hulk Hogan and &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage boiled over during the team&#x27;s match against The Twin Towers, leading to the team&#x27;s breakup upon Savage&#x27;s heel turn when Savage contended that Hogan was lusting after his manager, Miss Elizabeth.

===The Main Event III===

The Main Event III took place and aired live on February 23, 1990, at 10pm ET from the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan. The live broadcast drew a 12.8 rating and 20.9 million viewers.

Mike Tyson was originally scheduled to be the special guest referee, but this changed following Buster Douglas&#x27; knockout title win over Tyson just under two weeks before, on February 11. Tyson would eventually be the guest referee at WrestleMania XIV.

Tito Santana was a substitute for Jimmy Snuka.

===The Main Event IV===

The Main Event IV took place on October 30, 1990, from the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and aired on Friday November 23, 1990 at 10pm ET. The broadcast drew an 8.6 rating and 15 million viewers.

The WWF Tag Team Championship match between The Hart Foundation and The Rockers was supposed to be on the show. The Rockers defended their newly won titles a few times before the WWF rehired Jim Neidhart, pairing him with Bret Hart once more, and quietly handing the belts back to The Hart Foundation, erasing The Rockers&#x27; reign from the history books. Retrospectively, the WWF explained that the title change had been revoked due to a ring rope malfunction during the second fall of the two-out-of-three falls match. The match can be seen unedited on the DVD &quot;The Shawn Michaels Story: Heartbreak &amp; Triumph&quot;. Marty Jannetty pinned Bret Hart in the first fall with a sunset flip counter at 9:33. Hart pinned Shawn Michaels in the second fall with the Hart Attack at 19:23. Jannetty pinned Jim Neidhart in the third fall when Michaels dropkicked Jannetty onto Neidhart, who was setting up the Hart Attack at 25:41.

Nikolai Volkoff was scheduled to face Sgt. Slaughter on the show, but Slaughter attacked Nikolai before the opening bell rang and the match never took place.

===The Main Event V===

The Main Event V took place on January 28, 1991, from the Macon Coliseum in Macon, Georgia, and aired on Friday February 1, 1991 at 8pm ET.

KNBC, the NBC-owned-and-operated station in Los Angeles, did not air this program when it was shown by the network on February 1. That day, a collision took place at Los Angeles International Airport between a US Airways passenger jet and a SkyWest Airlines commuter plane. The crash occurred in the late afternoon, and KNBC opted to air news bulletin coverage of this story throughout the night. The station did replay the program unadvertised on a later date.

The broadcast drew 10.6 million viewers and a 6.7 rating, which was at the time the worst rating any WWF program had received on NBC despite the presence of Hulk Hogan. This has been blamed on the controversial and exploitative Sgt. Slaughter Iraqi sympathizer storyline that was on going at the time.

WWF President Jack Tunney declared Hulk Hogan the number one contender for Sgt. Slaughter&#x27;s WWF Championship at WrestleMania VII.

<text>José Paciano Laurel y García (March 9, 1891 – November 6, 1959) was a Filipino politician, lawyer, and judge, who served as the President of the Second Philippine Republic from 1943 to 1945, which was a Japanese ally during World War II. Since the administration of President Diosdado Macapagal (1961–1965), Laurel has been officially recognized by later administrations as a former president of the Philippines.

==Early life and education==


Jose Paciano Laurel y García was born on March 9, 1891, in the town of Tanauan, Batangas. His parents were Sotero Laurel y Remoquillo and Jacoba García y Pimentel, both from Tanauan. His father had been an official in the revolutionary government of Emilio Aguinaldo and a signatory to the 1899 Malolos Constitution. Just like many other presidents, he was of Chinese mestizo descent. His second given name Paciano was in honor of Paciano Rizal.

Laurel studied at the San Jose College in Tanauan before transferring in 1903 to Colegio de San Juan de Letran in Manila. He later attended &quot;La Regeneracion,&quot; where he completed the Spanish secondary course of instruction. In 1907, he finished the intermediate grades at Manila public schools.

While a teen, Laurel was indicted for attempted murder when he almost killed a rival suitor of the girl he stole a kiss from with a fan knife. While studying and finishing law school, he argued for and received an acquittal in 1912.

Laurel completed his high school education at Manila High School in 1911. He received his law degree from the University of the Philippines College of Law in 1915, where he studied under Dean George A. Malcolm, whom he would later succeed at the Supreme Court of the Philippines. In the same year, he took the Philippine bar examination and placed second. He then obtained a Master of Laws degree from the University of Santo Tomas in 1919. Laurel was later awarded a scholarship at Yale Law School, where he obtained his J.S.D. degree in 1920. In the same year, he was admitted to the Bar by the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. He later traveled extensively throughout the United States and Europe, where he also took special courses in international law at Oxford University in England and at the University of Paris in France before returning to the Philippines in 1921. He also earned his Doctorate in Jurisprudence at the Escuela de Derecho in Manila and Humanities at the University of Santo Tomas.

==Early career==
Laurel began his life in public service while he was a student. He served as a messenger in the Bureau of Forestry, then as a clerk in the Code Committee tasked with the codification of Philippine laws, and as a law clerk in the Executive Bureau. During his work for the Code Committee, he was introduced to its head, Thomas A. Street, a future Supreme Court Justice who would be a mentor to the young Laurel.

In 1921, Laurel was also appointed as a lecturer at University of the Philippines, particularly at the College of Liberal Arts and at the College of Law.

Laurel was appointed first as ad interim Undersecretary of the Interior Department in 1922 (with two stints as acting secretary), then promoted as Secretary of the Interior in 1923. In that post, he would frequently clash with the American Governor-General Leonard Wood, and eventually, in 1923, resign from his position together with other Cabinet members in protest of Wood&#x27;s administration. His clashes with Wood solidified Laurel&#x27;s nationalist credentials.

Laurel was a member of the Philippine fraternity Upsilon Sigma Phi.

==Senator and Congressman of the Philippines==
In 1925, Laurel was elected to the Philippine Senate, beating incumbent Senator Antero Soriano. Serving from the 5th district, he would serve for one term before losing his re-election bid in 1931 to fellow Batangueño Claro M. Recto.

He retired to private practice, but by 1934, he was again elected to public office, this time as a delegate to the 1935 Constitutional Convention. Hailed as one of the &quot;Seven Wise Men of the Convention&quot;, he would sponsor the provisions of the Bill of Rights. Following the ratification of the 1935 Constitution and the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, Laurel was appointed Associate Justice of the Supreme Court on February 29, 1936.

==Associate Justice of the Supreme Court==
Laurel&#x27;s Supreme Court tenure may have been overshadowed by his presidency, yet he remains one of the most important Supreme Court justices in Philippine history. He authored several leading cases still analyzed to this day that defined the parameters of the branches of government as well as their powers.

&quot;Angara v. Electoral Commission&quot;, 63 Phil. 139 (1936), which is considered as the Philippine equivalent of &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803), is Laurel&#x27;s most important contribution to jurisprudence and even the rule of law in the Philippines. In affirming that the Court had jurisdiction to review the rulings of the Electoral Commission organized under the National Assembly, the Court, through Justice Laurel&#x27;s opinion, firmly entrenched the power of Philippine courts to engage in judicial review of the acts of the other branches of government, and to interpret the Constitution. Held the Court, through Laurel:
The Constitution is a definition of the powers of government. Who is to determine the nature, scope, and extent of such powers? The Constitution itself has provided for the instrumentality of the judiciary as the rational way. And when the judiciary mediates to allocate constitutional boundaries, it does not assert any superiority over the other departments; it does not in reality nullify or invalidate an act of the legislature, but only asserts the solemn and sacred obligation assigned to it by the Constitution to determine conflicting claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the parties in an actual controversy the rights which that instrument secures and guarantees to them.

Another highly influential decision penned by Laurel was &quot;Ang Tibay v. CIR&quot;, 69 Phil. 635 (1940). The Court acknowledged in that case that the substantive and procedural requirements before proceedings in administrative agencies, such as labor relations courts, were more flexible than those in judicial proceedings. At the same time, the Court still asserted that the right to due process of law must be observed and enumerated the &quot;cardinal primary rights&quot; that must be respected in administrative proceedings. Since then, these &quot;cardinal primary rights&quot; have stood as the standard in testing due process claims in administrative cases.

&quot;Calalang v. Williams&quot;, 70 Phil. 726 (1940) was a seemingly innocuous case involving a challenge raised by a private citizen to a traffic regulation banning kalesas from Manila streets during certain afternoon hours. The Court, through Laurel, upheld the regulation as within the police power of the government. But in rejecting the claim that the regulation was violative of social justice, Laurel would respond with what would become his most famous aphorism, which is to this day widely quoted by judges and memorized by Filipino law students:
Social justice is neither communism, nor despotism, nor atomism, nor anarchy, but the humanization of laws and the equalization of social and economic forces by the State so that justice in its rational and objectively secular conception may at least be approximated. Social justice means the promotion of the welfare of all the people, the adoption by the Government of measures calculated to insure economic stability of all the competent elements of society, through the maintenance of a proper economic and social equilibrium in the interrelations of the members of the community, constitutionally, through the adoption of measures legally justifiable, or extra-constitutionally, through the exercise of powers underlying the existence of all governments on the time-honored principle of salus populi est suprema lex. Social justice, therefore, must be founded on the recognition of the necessity of interdependence among divers and diverse units of a society and of the protection that should be equally and evenly extended to all groups as a combined force in our social and economic life, consistent with the fundamental and paramount objective of the state of promoting the health, comfort, and quiet of all persons, and of bringing about &quot;the greatest good to the greatest number.

While an associate justice, Laurel also held other appointive posts. Laurel was appointed by President Manuel L. Quezon as a member of the Moral Code Committee in 1939 and as member of the Code Committee in 1940. In 1941, he was also appointed as Professor of Civil Law at the Central College of Law. He was also named as acting Secretary of Justice and acting Chief Justice in December of the same year and Commissioner of Justice in January 1942. His time as associate justice ended on February 5, 1942

==Cabinet member and accession==
As he was well known to the Japanese as a critic of US rule, as well as having demonstrated a willingness to serve under the Japanese Military Administration, he held a series of high posts in 1942–1943.

On December 10, 1941, then-Associate Justice Laurel was appointed by President Manuel L. Quezon as acting Secretary of Justice. He was later appointed Commissioner of Justice by the commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese Forces on January 26, 1942, but was effective three days prior. However, on December 2, 1942, he was relieved from the post to become the Minister of the Interior, a position that he had previously held as Secretary two decades prior. He relinquished the post on October 14, 1943, when he was inaugurated President of the Second Philippine Republic.

Laurel was among the Commonwealth officials instructed by the Japanese Imperial Army to form a provisional government when they invaded and occupied the country. He cooperated with the Japanese, in contrast to Chief Justice José Abad Santos, who was shot for refusing to cooperate.

=== Assassination attempt ===
On June 5, 1943, Laurel was playing golf at the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club, then in the City of Greater Manila, when he was shot around four times with a .45 caliber pistol by an american. The bullets barely missed his heart and liver. He was rushed by his golfing companions, among them Far Eastern University president Nicanor Reyes Sr., to the Philippine General Hospital where he was operated by the Chief Military Surgeon of the Japanese Military Administration and Filipino surgeons. Laurel enjoyed a speedy recovery.

Two suspects to the shooting were reportedly captured and swiftly executed by the Kempetai. Another suspect, a former boxer named Feliciano Lizardo, was presented for identification by the Japanese to Laurel at the latter&#x27;s hospital bed, but Laurel then professed unclear memory.

However, in his 1953 memoirs, Laurel would admit that Lizardo, by then one of his bodyguards who had pledged to give his life for him, was indeed the would-be-assassin. Still, the historian Teodoro Agoncillo in his book on the Japanese occupation, identified a captain with a guerilla unit as the shooter.

== Presidency (1943–1945) ==

The presidency of Laurel understandably remains one of the most controversial in Philippine history. After the war, he would be denounced as a war collaborator and even a traitor, although his indictment for treason was superseded by President Roxas&#x27; Amnesty Proclamation.

===Accession===

When Japan invaded, President Manuel L. Quezon first fled to Bataan and then to the United States to establish a government-in-exile. Quezon ordered Laurel, Vargas and other cabinet members to stay. Laurel&#x27;s prewar, close relationship with Japanese officials (a son had been sent to study at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in Tokyo, and Laurel had received an honorary doctorate from Tokyo Imperial University) in 1938, placed him in a good position to interact with the Japanese occupation forces.

Under vigorous Japanese influence, the National Assembly selected Laurel to serve as president in 1943. He took the oath of office on October 14, 1943, at the Legislative Building (now the National Museum of Fine Arts) in Manila. The oath was administered by Chief Justice José Yulo.

=== Administration and cabinet ===
===Domestic problems===
====Economy====
During Laurel&#x27;s tenure as president, hunger was the main worry. Prices of essential commodities rose to unprecedented heights. The government exerted every effort to increase production and bring consumers&#x27; goods under control. However, Japanese rapacity had the better of it all. On the other hand, guerrilla activities and Japanese retaliatory measures brought the peace and order situation to a difficult point. Resorting to district-zoning and domiciliary searches, coupled with arbitrary arrests, the Japanese made the mission of Laurel&#x27;s administration incalculably exasperating and perilous.

====Food shortage====
During his presidency, the Philippines faced a crippling food shortage which demanded much of Laurel&#x27;s attention. Rice and bread were still available but the sugar supply was gone.

===Policy towards Japan===
====Philippine-Japanese Treaty of Alliance====
On October 20, 1943, the Philippine-Japanese Treaty of Alliance was signed by Claro M. Recto, who was appointed by Laurel as his Foreign Minister, and Japanese Ambassador to Philippines Sozyo Murata. One redeeming feature was that no conscription was envisioned.

====Greater East Asia Conference====

Shortly after the inauguration of the Second Philippine Republic, President Laurel, together with cabinet Ministers Recto and Paredes flew to Tokyo to attend the Greater East Asia Conference which was an international summit held in Tokyo, Japan from November 5 to 6, 1943, in which Japan hosted the heads of state of various component members of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The conference was also referred to as the &quot;Tokyo Conference&quot;.

The Conference addressed few issues of any substance, Eradication of Western Opium Drug Trade and to illustrate the Empire of Japan&#x27;s commitments to the Pan-Asianism ideal and to emphasize its role as the &quot;liberator&quot; of Asia from Western colonialism.

===Martial law===
Laurel declared the country under martial law in 1944 through Proclamation No. 29, dated September 21. Martial law came into effect on September 22, 1944, at 9 a.m. Proclamation No. 30 was issued the next day, declaring the existence of a state of war between the Philippines and the United States and the United Kingdom. This took effect on September 23, 1944, at 10:00 a.m.

===Resistance===
Due to the nature of Laurel&#x27;s government and its connection to Japan, much of the population actively resisted the Japanese occupation and his presidency, instead supporting the exiled Commonwealth government.

===Dissolution of the regime===

On October 20, 1944, American and Philippine armed forces landed on Leyte Island during the Battle of Leyte and began the Liberation of the Philippines. Philippine President in exile Sergio Osmeña was among them. Other landings on other islands followed. Then on January 9, 1945, Allied forces landed on the south shore of Lingayen Gulf and began to march towards Manila.

During the Battle of Manila from February 3 to March 3, 1945, Japanese occupation forces were driven from the capital city. After that, only pockets of Japanese forces remained active in the Philippines.

Beginning in March 1945, President Laurel, together with his family, Camilo Osías, Benigno Aquino Sr., Gen. Mateo M. Capinpin, and Jorge B. Vargas evacuated to Baguio. Shortly after the city fell, they traveled to Tuguegarao, where they embarked a bomber plane to Japan via Formosa (now Taiwan) and Shanghai, China.

Emperor Hirohito of Japan announced Japan&#x27;s unconditional surrender to the Allied Powers on August 15, 1945.

Two days later on August 17, 1945, from Nara Hotel in Nara, Japan, Laurel issued an executive proclamation which declared the dissolution of his regime.

== Post-presidency (1945–1959) ==

===Collaboration trial and imprisonment===
On September 2, 1945, the Japanese forces formally surrendered to the United States. Gen. Douglas MacArthur ordered Laurel arrested for collaborating with the Japanese. Alongside his son Jose Laurel III and Benigno Aquino Sr., he was taken to custody and was imprisoned in Yokohama on September 15, 1945. On November 16, 1945, they were transferred to Sugamo Prison. While in prison, he was not allowed to have any reading material except &quot;The World in 2030&quot;, a book by the Earl of Birkenhead that he received as a gift from his son Salvador Laurel. Lacking in writing instruments, he used this book to write his &quot;Memoirs&quot;.

On July 23, 1946, Laurel, together with Osias, Aquino, and his son Jose III, left Tokyo for Manila, having been turned over to the Republic of the Philippines. One month later, he was placed under technical custody at his Peñafrancia house in Paco, Manila but rather than accepting the given conditions, he preferred to be imprisoned at the New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa, Rizal. He was later provisionally released in September 1946 after posting a bail. He was also charged with 132 counts of treason in 1946 and was tried by the People&#x27;s Court. However, the trial ended prematurely due to the general amnesty granted by President Manuel Roxas in 1948.

===1949 presidential election===
Laurel ran for president as a nominee of the Nacionalista Party against Elpidio Quirino in the 1949 Philippine presidential election but lost in what future Foreign Affairs Secretary Carlos P. Romulo and Marvin M. Gray considered as the dirtiest election in Philippine electoral history.

===Return to the Senate===
Laurel garnered more than 2 million votes and was elected to the Senate of the Philippines as the top vote-getter in the 1951 Philippine Senate election, under the Nacionalista Party. He was urged to run for president in 1953, but declined, working instead for the successful election of Ramon Magsaysay. Magsaysay appointed Laurel head of a mission tasked with negotiating trade and other issues with United States officials, the result being known as the Laurel–Langley Agreement. Laurel was also named as chairman of the Senate Committee on Education, which he held when he sponsored in 1955 a bill that would make José Rizal&#x27;s two novels, &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot; and &quot;El filibusterismo&quot;, as compulsory readings in all universities and colleges.

===Retirement and death===
Laurel considered his election to the Senate as a vindication of his reputation. He declined to run for re-election in 1957. He retired from public life, concentrating on the development of the Lyceum of the Philippines established by his family, as well as the Philippine Banking Corporation, which he had established.

During his retirement, Laurel resided in a 1957 three-story, seven-bedroom mansion in Mandaluyong, Rizal, dubbed &quot;Villa Pacencia&quot; after Laurel&#x27;s wife. The home was one of three residences constructed by the Laurel family, the other two being in Tanauan, Batangas and in Paco, Manila (called &quot;Villa Peñafrancia&quot;). In 2008, the Laurel family sold &quot;Villa Pacencia&quot; to then-Senate President Manny Villar and his wife Cynthia.

In 1958, Laurel launched an organization known as Committee of Citizens, which he headed. On the same year, it was announced that his book entitled &quot;Thinking of Ourselves&quot; would be launched and The Manila Times announced the launching of Unity Movement for National Survival that he sponsored. On his 68th birthday on March 9, 1959, President Carlos P. Garcia conferred him the award of Philippine Legion of Honor with the degree of Chief Commander.

In the early afternoon of November 5, 1959, Laurel suffered a stroke. On November 6, 1959, at 1:00 in the morning, he died at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Manila, from a massive heart attack and cerebral hemorrhage. President Carlos P. Garcia declared a &quot;period of national mourning&quot; from November 6 to the day of Laurel&#x27;s interment over Laurel&#x27;s death. His wake was held at Villa Pacencia in Mandaluyong before being interred on November 8, 1959, at what is now Tanauan City Public Cemetery in Tanauan, Batangas.

<text>A two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) or two-stage rocket is a launch vehicle in which two distinct stages provide propulsion consecutively in order to achieve orbital velocity. It is intermediate between a three-stage-to-orbit launcher and a hypothetical single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) launcher.

At liftoff the first stage is responsible for accelerating the vehicle. At some point the second stage detaches from the first stage and continues to orbit under its own power.

An advantage of such a system over single-stage-to-orbit is that most of the dry mass of the vehicle is not carried into orbit. This reduces the cost involved in reaching orbital velocity, as much of the structure and engine mass is ejected, and a larger percentage of the orbited mass is payload mass.

An advantage over three or more stages is a reduction in complexity and fewer separation events, which reduces cost and risk of failure.

==Examples==
* Historical
** Cosmos-3M
** Delta IV Medium
** Falcon 1
** Saturn IB
** Titan II GLV
** Tsyklon-2
** Zenit-2 and Zenit-2M
* Current
** Atlas V 401 and 501
** Electron
** Falcon 9
** Vulcan Centaur
*In development
** Angara 1.2
** Starship
** New Glenn
** Miura 5

It is not always clear when a vehicle is a TSTO, due to the use of strap-on booster rockets at launch. These are dropped early on in the flight and may or may not be considered an additional stage if the core engine(s) continue firing. These are sometimes considered half a stage, leading to the expression one-and-a-half-stage-to-orbit (1.5STO) e.g. for the Long March 5B or the Atlas missile, which was a single core stage with additional boosters. Similarly, two-stage designs with additional boosters can be referred to as 2.5-stage rockets e.g. the Ariane 5 or most Atlas V variants (all except the 401 and 501).

==Reusable launch systems==

With reference to a reusable launch system this approach is often proposed as an alternative to single-stage-to-orbit (or &quot;SSTO&quot;). Its supporters argue that, since each stage may have a lower mass ratio than an SSTO launch system, such a system may be built further away from limits of its structural materials. It is argued that a two-stage design should require less maintenance, less testing, experience fewer failures and have a longer working life. In addition the two-stage approach allows the lower stage to be optimized for operation in the Earth&#x27;s lower atmosphere, where pressure and drag are high, while the upper stage can be optimized for operation in the near-vacuum conditions of the later part of the launch. This allows an increase in the payload mass fraction of a two-stage vehicle over single-stage or stage-and-a-half vehicles, which have to perform in both environments using the same hardware.

Critics argue that the increased complexity of designing two separate stages that must interact, the logistics involved in returning the first stage to the launch site, and the difficulties of conducting incremental testing on a second stage will outweigh these benefits. In the case of airplane-like lower stages they also argue how difficult and expensive high speed aircraft (like the SR-71) are to develop and operate, and question performance claims. Many &#x27;mini-shuttle&#x27; designs that use transport aircraft as first stages also face similar problems with ice/foam as the Space Shuttle due to the requirement they also carry a large external tank for their fuel.

As of 2023, SpaceX and NASA are the only launch providers which have achieved first-stage reuse of an orbital vehicle with SpaceX’s two-stage Falcon 9 and 2.5-stage Falcon Heavy, and NASA’s Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters. Rocket Lab has recovered multiple first stages of their Electron rocket, but has not flown them again. 

===Helicopter-like first stage===
Taking the view that airplane like operations do not translate to airplane-like appearance, some reusable TSTO concepts have first stages that operate as VTOL or VTOHL aircraft. The DC-X has proven the VTOL option design workable. Other designs like the DH-1 concept take it a step further and use a &#x27;pop-up/pop-down&#x27; approach, which delivers the orbiting stage to a point about 60 km above the Earth&#x27;s surface, before dropping down to the launch pad again. In the case of the DH-1, the upper stage is effectively an &#x27;almost SSTO&#x27; with a more realistic mass fraction and which was optimised for reliability.

===Airplane-like first stage===

Some TSTO designs comprise an airplane-like first stage and a rocket-like second stage. The airplane elements can be wings, air-breathing engines, or both. This approach appeals because it transforms Earth&#x27;s atmosphere from an obstacle into an advantage. Above a certain speed and altitude, wings and scramjets cease being effective, and the rocket is deployed to complete the trip to orbit.

Saenger (spacecraft) was among the first concepts of this type.

While not an orbital vehicle, the successful private SpaceShipOne suborbital spacecraft developed for the Ansari X Prize demonstrated that a two-stage system with a winged aircraft as the &quot;lower half&quot; can reach the edge of space. The team behind SpaceShipOne has built and flown a commercial sub-orbital launch system — SpaceShipTwo — based on this technology.

The Pegasus rocket while airplane launched, is not a two-stage-to-orbit system because the rocket component itself is composed of multiple stages.

<text>Pinus bhutanica, which may be called the Bhutan white pine, is a tree restricted to Bhutan and adjacent parts of northeast India (Arunachal Pradesh) and southwest China (Yunnan and Tibet). Along with the related &quot;Pinus wallichiana&quot; it is a constituent of lower altitude blue pine forests. This pine reaches a height of 25 meters. Note that &quot;P. wallichiana&quot; is sometimes called by the common name &#x27;Bhutan pine&#x27;.

The needles are in bundles of five, up to 25 cm long. The cones are 12–20 cm in length, with thin scales; the seeds are 5–6 mm long, with a 20–25 mm wing. It differs from &quot;P. wallichiana&quot; in the much longer, strongly drooping needles, and the cones being slightly smaller and red-brown, rather than yellow-buff, when mature. It is also adapted to generally warmer, wetter climates at lower altitudes, with an intense summer monsoon. Despite the two being closely related and at least occasionally growing together, no hybrids or intermediates have ever been reported.

<text>In mathematics, a map or mapping is a function in its general sense. These terms may have originated as from the process of making a geographical map: &quot;mapping&quot; the Earth surface to a sheet of paper.

The term &quot;map&quot; may be used to distinguish some special types of functions, such as homomorphisms. For example, a linear map is a homomorphism of vector spaces, while the term linear function may have this meaning or it may mean a linear polynomial. In category theory, a map may refer to a morphism. The term &quot;transformation&quot; can be used interchangeably, but &quot;transformation&quot; often refers to a function from a set to itself. There are also a few less common uses in logic and graph theory.

==Maps as functions==
In many branches of mathematics, the term &quot;map&quot; is used to mean a function, sometimes with a specific property of particular importance to that branch. For instance, a &quot;map&quot; is a &quot;continuous function&quot; in topology, a &quot;linear transformation&quot; in linear algebra, etc.

Some authors, such as Serge Lang, use &quot;function&quot; only to refer to maps in which the codomain is a set of numbers (i.e. a subset of R or C), and reserve the term &quot;mapping&quot; for more general functions.

Maps of certain kinds have been given specific names. These include homomorphisms in algebra, isometries in geometry, operators in analysis and representations in group theory. 

In the theory of dynamical systems, a map denotes an evolution function used to create discrete dynamical systems. 

A &quot;partial map&quot; is a &quot;partial function&quot;. Related terminology such as &quot;domain&quot;, &quot;codomain&quot;, &quot;injective&quot;, and &quot;continuous&quot; can be applied equally to maps and functions, with the same meaning. All these usages can be applied to &quot;maps&quot; as general functions or as functions with special properties.

==As morphisms==
In category theory, &quot;map&quot; is often used as a synonym for &quot;morphism&quot; or &quot;arrow&quot;, which is a structure-respecting function and thus may imply more structure than &quot;function&quot; does. For example, a morphism formula_1 in a concrete category (i.e. a morphism that can be viewed as a function) carries with it the information of its domain (the source formula_2 of the morphism) and its codomain (the target formula_3). In the widely used definition of a function formula_4, formula_5 is a subset of formula_6 consisting of all the pairs formula_7 for formula_8. In this sense, the function does not capture the set formula_3 that is used as the codomain; only the range formula_10 is determined by the function.

<text>The International Joint Commission () is a bi-national organization established by the governments of the United States and Canada under the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909. Its responsibilities were expanded with the signing of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1972 (later amended 1987 and 2012). The commission deals with issues affecting the extensive waters and waterways along the Canada–United States border.

A six member commission, it has multiple sub-commissions, which deal with particular sections of the border-waters, or topics, and a technical staff to organize and inform task-forces.

In a report published in January 2025, called on the U.S. and Canadian governments to take action to monitor microplastics in the lakes, and to designate microplastics a &quot;chemical of mutual concern&quot;. Scientists in the group&#x27;s advisory board would like to see new policies to help reduce plastic production and consumption. They also recommend individual actions such as single-use plastic products, and installing filters on washing machines and dryers so that plastic fibers are not released with wastewater.

==Role of the IJC==

Canada and the United States created the International Joint Commission because they recognized that each country is affected by the other&#x27;s actions in lake and river systems along the border. The two countries cooperate to manage these waters and to protect them for the benefit of today&#x27;s citizens and future generations.

The IJC is guided by the Boundary Waters Treaty, signed by Britain in right of Canada and the United States in 1909. The treaty provides general principles, rather than detailed prescriptions, for preventing and resolving disputes over waters shared between the two countries and for settling other transboundary issues. The specific application of these principles is decided on a case-by-case basis.

The IJC has two main responsibilities: approving projects that affect water levels and flows across the boundary and investigating transboundary issues and recommending solutions. The IJC&#x27;s recommendations and decisions take into account the needs of a wide range of water uses, including drinking water, commercial shipping, hydroelectric power generation, agriculture, ecosystem health, industry, fishing, recreational boating and shoreline property.

==Mission and mandates==
The International Joint Commission prevents and resolves disputes between the United States and Canada under the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty and pursues the common good of both countries as an independent and objective advisor to the two governments.

In particular, the IJC rules upon applications for approval of projects affecting boundary or transboundary waters and may regulate the operation of these projects; it assists the two countries in the protection of the transboundary environment, including the implementation of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and the improvement of transboundary air quality; and it alerts the governments to emerging issues along the boundary that may give rise to bilateral disputes.

==Authorities==
===Orders of approval===
The IJC has the authority to issue orders of approval. These orders place conditions on the application and operation of projects, such as dams, diversions or bridges that would affect the natural level of boundary waters. The application process for an order of approval is outlined in the IJC guide to applications.

===References===
The IJC studies and recommends solutions to transboundary issues when asked to do so by the national governments. When the IJC receives a government request, called a reference, it appoints a board with equal numbers of experts from each country. Board members are chosen for their professional abilities, not as representatives of a particular organization or region.

==Activities==

===Regulating shared water uses===
The IJC makes decisions on applications for projects, such as dams and diversions, that affect the natural level and flow of water across the boundary. Changing water levels can affect drinking water intakes, commercial shipping, hydroelectric power generation, agriculture, shoreline property, recreation, fisheries, wildlife, wetlands and other interests.

If the IJC approves a project, it may impose conditions on project design or operation to protect interests on either side of the boundary. The IJC may also appoint a board to monitor compliance of operational requirements, such as flows through a dam. Projects approved by the IJC include hydroelectric power projects in the Great Lakes and on the St. Lawrence River, the St. Croix River and the Columbia River. The IJC is also responsible for maintaining emergency water levels in the Lake of the Woods basin and for apportioning water among various uses in the Souris River, St. Mary River and Milk River basins.

===Improving water quality===
In the Boundary Waters Treaty, Canada and the United States agreed that neither country will pollute boundary waters, or waters that flow across the boundary, to an extent that would cause injury to health or property in the other country. When asked by governments, the IJC investigates, monitors and recommends actions regarding the quality of water in lakes and rivers along the Canada-United States border. The IJC has water quality responsibilities for the St. Croix River, the Rainy River and the Red River. Much of the Commission&#x27;s work focuses on helping governments clean up the Great Lakes and prevent further pollution.

===Improving air quality===
As well as damaging rivers and lakes, air pollution affects human health, especially for people with respiratory illnesses such as chronic bronchitis and asthma. Over the years, the American and Canadian governments have asked the IJC to bring to their attention, or to investigate, air pollution problems in boundary regions. To support these activities, the IJC created the International Air Quality Advisory Board. As well, under the 1991 Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement, the IJC is required to collect and synthesize public comments on the air quality progress report published by the governments every two years.

===Investigating issues and recommending solutions===
The IJC studies and recommends solutions to transboundary issues when asked to do so by the national governments. When the IJC receives a government request, called a reference, it appoints a board with equal numbers of experts from each country. Board members are chosen for their professional abilities, not as representatives of a particular organization or region.

References to the IJC have focused mostly on water and air quality and on the development and use of shared water resources. For example, one reference led to the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (1972), in which the two countries agreed to control pollution and to clean up wastewater from industries and communities. In 1978, a new agreement added a commitment to rid the Great Lakes of persistent toxic substances, which remain in the environment for a long time and can poison food sources for animals and people. 

Although IJC reference recommendations are not binding, they are usually accepted by the Canadian and American governments.

==Organization==
The Commission is headed by six commissioners, three from each country. The Commissioners are appointed by the government of Canada and the United States. Commissioners do not represent their governments. The Canadian Commissioners appointed in 2019 are Pierre Béland (Canadian Chair), Merrel-Ann Phare and F. Henry Lickers. The American Commissioners appointed in 2019 are Jane Corwin (American Chair), Robert C. Sisson, and Lance V. Yohe.

The Commission has three offices, in Ottawa, Washington, D.C., and Windsor, Ontario. The Windsor Great Lakes Regional Office (GLRO) was created under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA). It is staffed by a bi-national team of American and Canadian scientists and support staff.

<text>The Suin Line (Suwon-Incheon; ) was a metro line of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway serving the Seoul Capital Area.

The original route, abandoned in 1995, was one of the few narrow-gauge railways in South Korea. Opened by the privately owned Chosen Gyeongdong Railway in 1937, it connected Suwon to Namincheon via Ansan and Siheung; in 1942, it was taken over by another private railway, the Chosen Railway (the largest of colonial Korea&#x27;s privately owned railway companies). The Chosen Railway owned the line until all railways in Korea were nationalized after 1945. However, since December 28, 2004, the Suin Line is being reconstructed with standard gauge and double tracking as an integral part of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway network and is opening in three phases.

All northbound trains terminated at Incheon, all southbound services terminated at Oido. Express train service served only Oido, Soraepogu, Incheon Nonhyeon, Woninjae, Yeonsu, Inha University, and Incheon.

Trains along the line were 6 cars long. Platforms at stations are built for 8 cars in preparation for the merging of the Bundang Line with the Suin Line, and are prepared for 10 cars when the extension occurs.

Trains run at an interval of 15 minutes throughout the day.

==History==

2012:
:June 30: The rebuilt Suin Line is officially opened from Oido to Songdo.

2014:
:December 27: Darwol Station opens as an in-fill station.

2016:
:February 27: The line is extended westward from Songdo to Incheon.

2017:
:July 10: Express service is launched on the line.

2020:
:September 12: The line is extended eastward from Oido to Suwon. The Suin Line and Bundang Line are integrated into Suin–Bundang Line, which connects Incheon and Wangsimni. Trains run from Cheongnyangni station or Wangsimni station to Jukjeon station, Gosaek station, or Incheon station.

===Planned for the future===
Hagik station is planned to open between Songdo and Inha University in 2020. In addition, a connection line is under consideration at Suwon that will allow KTX trains to run between the Gyeongbu high-speed railway and Incheon Station via the Suin-Bundang Line by 2025.

==Stations==
===Current alignment===
===Former alignment===
==Rolling stock==
The Suin Line used 18 Korail Class 351000 trains. They were the same as the third generation Class 351000 trains from the Bundang Line, except that they were painted red like the Gyeongui-Jungang Line and Line 1 trains. These trains have since been repainted yellow to match the color of Bundang Line trains; this was done in anticipation of the merging of the Bundang and Suin Lines into the Suin–Bundang Line.

For the former Suin Line, the Korean National Railroad built a narrow gauge steam locomotive, the KNR160 diesel car (also known as the Niigata/Kawasaki Diesel Car), and the KNR18000 passenger car. One KNR160 car (later renumbered KNR9160) and two KNR18000 car are preserved at the railroad museum in nearby Uiwang.

<text>The Saemaul Undong (), also known as the New Community Movement, New Village Movement, Saemaul Movement or Saema&#x27;eul Movement, was a political initiative launched on April22, 1970 by South Korean president Park Chung Hee to modernize the rural South Korean economy. The idea was based on the Korean traditional communalism called &quot;Hyangyak&quot; (향약, 鄕約) and &quot;Dure&quot; (두레), which provided the rules for self-governance and cooperation in traditional Korean communities. The movement initially sought to rectify the growing disparity of the standard of living between the nation&#x27;s urban centers, which were rapidly industrializing, and the small villages, which continued to be mired in poverty. Diligence, self-help and collaboration were the slogans to encourage community members to participate in the development process. The early stage of the movement focused on improving the basic living conditions and environments, whereas later projects concentrated on building rural infrastructure and increasing community income. Though hailed as a great success by force in the 1970s, the movement lost momentum during the 1980s due to the unexpected assassination of Park Chung-hee.

==Overview==
The movement promoted self-help and collaboration among the people during its first phase, as the central government provided a fixed amount of raw materials to each of the participating villages free of charge and entrusted the locals to build whatever they wished with them. The government first selected 33,267 villages and provided 335 sacks of cement. 16,600 villages that demonstrated success were then granted additional resources of 500 sacks of cement and a ton of iron bars.

The New Community Movement did much to improve infrastructure in rural South Korea, bringing modernized facilities such as irrigation systems, bridges and roads in rural communities. The program also marked the widespread appearance of orange tiled houses throughout the countryside, replacing the traditional thatched or &quot;choga-jip&quot; houses. Encouraged by the success in rural areas, the movement spread through factories and urban areas as well, and became a nationwide modernization movement.

However, despite the Saemaul Movement&#x27;s great success in reducing poverty and improving living conditions in rural areas during its first phase, income levels in urban areas were still higher than income levels in rural areas after the rapid industrialization of South Korea. The government-led movement with its highly centralized organization proved to be efficient in the 1970s and early 1980s, but it became less effective after South Korea entered into a more developed and industrialized stage, which diminished the momentum of the movement. The relatively low income levels in rural areas compared to urban areas became a major political issue in the late 1980s – one that no government intervention was able to fully solve during the first phase – and the movement proved ultimately inadequate in addressing the larger problem of migration from the villages to the cities by the country&#x27;s younger demographic. Moreover, the government-led centralized system caused corruption, such as misuse of funding, and changed South Korea&#x27;s environment.

Recognizing these problems, the South Korean government changed the centralized structure of the movement by empowering civil society to lead the movement. Since 1998, the Saemaul Movement has entered into the second phase, focusing on new issues such as enhancing voluntary services in the community and international cooperation with developing countries.

Many developing countries in Africa are paying attention to the implications of the Saemaul Undong. Through the program such as Yonsei-KOICA Master&#x27;s Degree Program, the Korean government is helping officials working in developing countries to design and implement new policies and programs in the context of national development policies.

A 2022 study attributed the initiative with shoring up support for Park Chung Hee&#x27;s authoritarian regime. The initiative had persistent effects, leading to greater support for the dictator&#x27;s daughter when she was democratically elected in 2012.

==Basic steps==
The Korea Saemaul Undong Center explains how Saemaul Undong was practiced in the 1970s in South Korea in five steps:

== Criticism ==
During the late 1960s and 1970s when the policy started being implemented under the regime of President Park, local traditions and beliefs were suppressed, akin to the Cultural Revolution in communist China which happened at the same time. The movement &quot;Misin tapa undong&quot; (&quot;to defeat the worship of gods&quot;), also described as &quot;movement to destroy superstition&quot;) reached its peak during the &quot;Saemaul Undong&quot; period. Old zelkova trees that had stood at village entrances and have traditionally served as guardian figures were cut down in order to erase &quot;superstition&quot;. Practitioners of Korean shamanism were harassed, essentially destroying centuries old Korean traditions.

In addition, Saemaul Undong meetings were often used to identify political dissidents and reinforce dedication to Park&#x27;s military regime. Under The Presidential Trust Commission, it was found that 334 individuals were killed, 1,744 were killed, and 7,328 people were falsely incarcerated largely due to expressing anti-government beliefs in connection to Saemaul Udong.

<text>Hama ( &quot;&quot;, ; ; ) is a city on the banks of the Orontes River in west-central Syria. It is located north of Damascus and north of Homs. It is the provincial capital of the Hama Governorate. With a population of 996,000 (2023 census), Hama is one of the four largest cities in Syria, with Damascus, Aleppo and Homs, it is also home to the dessert of Halawet el Jibn.

The city is renowned for its seventeen norias used for watering the gardens, which are claimed to date back to 1100 BC. Though historically used for irrigation, the norias today are purely for show for the local population.

==History==

The ancient settlement of Hamath was occupied from the early Neolithic to the Iron Age.

===Neolithic===
The stratigraphy is very generalized, which makes detailed comparison to other sites difficult. Level M ( thick) contained both white ware (lime-plaster) and true pottery. It may be contemporary with Ras Shamra V (6000–5000 BC).

===Chalcolithic===
Remains from the Chalcolithic have been uncovered by Danish archaeologists on the mount on which the former citadel once stood. The excavation took place between 1931 and 1938 under the direction of Harald Ingholt. The overlying level L dates to the Chalcolithic Halaf culture.

===Bronze Age===
====Mitanni period====
Although the town appears to be unmentioned in cuneiform sources before the first millennium BC, the site appears to have been prosperous around 1500 BC, when it was presumably an Amorite dependency of Mitanni, an empire along the Euphrates in northeastern Syria.

====Hittite period====
By around 1350 BC, Mitanni was overthrown by the Hittites, who controlled all of northern Syria.

In the south, the Hittites were in conflict with the Egyptians. Hamath became an important urban center. The conflict culminated in the famous Battle of Kadesh against Ancient Egypt under Ramesses II near Homs in 1285 BC.

In early 19th century, Johann Ludwig Burckhardt was the first to discover Hittite or Luwian hieroglyphic script at Hama.

===Iron Age===
The Fall of the Hittite Empire saw the Neo-Hittite/Aramaean Hama attested as the capital of one of the prosperous Syro-Hittite states known from the Hebrew Bible as Hamath (Aramaic: &quot;Ḥmt&quot;; Hittite: &quot;Amatuwana&quot;; ), which traded extensively, particularly with Israel and Judah.

====Assyrian inscriptions====
When the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III (858–824 BC) conquered the north of Aramea, he reached Hamath (Assyrian: &quot;Amat&quot; or &quot;Hamata&quot;) in 853 BC; this marks the beginning of Assyrian inscriptions relating to the kingdom. Irhuleni of Hamath and Hadadezer of Aram-Damascus (biblical &quot;Bar-Hadad&quot;) led a coalition of Aramean cities against the encroaching Assyrian armies. According to Assyrian sources, they were confronted by 4,000 chariots, 2,000 horsemen, 62,000-foot-soldiers and 1,000 Arab camel-riders in the Battle of Qarqar. The attested win for the Assyrians seems to have actually been more of a draw, although Shalmaneser III continued on to the shore and even took a ship to open sea. In the following years, Shalmaneser III failed to conquer Hamath or Aram-Damascus. After the death of Shalmaneser III, the former allies Hamath and Aram-Damascus fell out, and Aram-Damascus seems to have taken over some of Hamath&#x27;s territory.

An Aramaic inscription of Zakkur, dual king of Hamath and Luhuti, tells of an attack by a coalition including Sam&#x27;al under Ben-Hadad III, son of Hazael, king of Aram-Damascus. Zakir was besieged in his fortress of Hazrak, but saved by intervention of the God Baalshamin. Later on, the state of Sam&#x27;al came to rule both Hamath and Aram. 

In 743 BC, Tiglath-Pileser III took a number of towns in the territory of Hamath, distributed the territories among his generals, and forcibly removed 1,223 selected inhabitants to the valley of the Upper Tigris; he exacted tribute from Hamath&#x27;s king, Eni-Ilu (Eniel).

In 738 BC, Hamath is listed among the cities again conquered by Assyrian troops. Over 30,000 natives were deported to Ullaba (located in Urartu) and replaced with captives from the Zagros Mountains.

====Destruction under Sargon II====
After the fall of the northern kingdom of Israel, Hamath&#x27;s king Ilu-Bi&#x27;di (Jau-Bi&#x27;di) led a failed revolt of the newly organized Assyrian provinces of Arpad, Simirra, Damascus, and Samara.

Styling himself the &quot;Destroyer of Hamath,&quot; Sargon II razed the city c. 720 BC, recolonized it with 6300 Assyrians and removed its king to be flayed alive in Assyria. He also carried off to Nimrud the ivory-adorned furnishings of its kings.

Displaced persons from Hamath subsequently comprised an important part of the multi-ethnic Aramaean community at Elephantine and Syene (now Aswan) in Egypt starting in 700 BCE, where alongside similarly displaced Jews they produced a large corpus of materials in Imperial Aramaic known as the Elephantine papyri and ostraca.

====Hamath in the Bible====
The few Biblical reports state that Hamath was the capital of a Canaanite kingdom (; ), whose king congratulated King David on his defeat of Hadadezer, king of Zobah (; ). In God&#x27;s instructions to Moses, Hamath is specified as part of the northern border of the land that will fall to the children of Israel as an inheritance when they enter the land of Canaan (). Solomon, it would seem, took possession of Hamath and its territory and built store cities (; ). names the &quot;entrance of Hamath&quot;, or Lebo-Hamath, as the northern border of Israel at the time of the dedication of the first temple in Jerusalem. The area was subsequently lost to the Syrians, but Jeroboam II, king of Israel, is said to have &quot;restored the territory of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah (the Dead Sea)&quot;.

Assyria&#x27;s defeat of Hamath made a profound impression on Isaiah (). The prophet Amos also named the town &quot;Hamath the Great&quot; ().

===Persian, Hellenistic and Roman history===

In 539 BC, Cyrus the Great, King of Achaemenid Empire, took Syria as part of his empire, to be known as Eber-Nari. In July 522 BC, Cambyses II died at a location called Agbatana, which is most likely the modern city of Hama.

In the second half of the 4th century BC the modern region of Syria came under the influence of Greco-Roman culture, following long lasting semitic and Persian cultures. Alexander the Great&#x27;s campaign from 334 to 323 BC brought Syria under Hellenic rule. Since the country lay on the trade routes from Asia to Greece, Hama and many other Syrian cities again grew rich through trade. After the death of Alexander the Great his Near East conquests were divided between his generals, and Seleucus Nicator became ruler of Syria and the founder of the Seleucid dynasty. Under the Seleucids there was a revival in the fortunes of Hama. The Aramaeans were allowed to return to the city, which was renamed Epiphaneia (), after the Seleucid Emperor Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Seleucid rule began to decline, however, in the next two centuries, and Arab dynasties began to gain control of cities in this part of Syria, including Hama.

The Romans took over original settlements such as &quot;Hama&quot; and made them their own. They met little resistance when they invaded Syria under Pompey and annexed it in 64 BC, whereupon Hama became part of the Roman province of Syria, ruled from Rome by a proconsul. Hama was an important city during the Greek and Roman periods, but very little archaeological evidence remains. As Syria became part of the Roman Empire, five hundred Hamian archers, known as &quot;&quot;Cohors Prima Hamiorum Sagittaria&quot;, were stationed at Magnis on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in northern Britain starting from AD 120. The same unit or another one was later renamed to &quot;Numerus Syrorum Saggitariorum&quot;&quot; and located at Derventio Brigantum (Malton). The garrison unit was transferred to Bar Hill Fort on the Antonine Wall in Scotland in AD 142–157, then back to Magnis in AD 163–166, during the early reign of Marcus Aurelius. They might have also stationed at Housesteads, as a tombstone of an archer was located there. However, the cohort&#x27;s presence in Britain was proven by military diplomas, found in Stannington (AD 122) and Ravenglass (AD 124), in addition to altars dedicated to Syrian Goddesses discovered at Catterick.

In AD 330, the capital of the Roman Empire was moved to Byzantium, and the city continued to prosper. In Byzantine days, Hama was known as Emath or Emathoùs (&quot;Εμαθούς&quot; in Greek). Roman rule from Byzantium meant the Christian religion was strengthened throughout the Near East, and churches were built in Hama and other cities. The Byzantine historian John of Epiphania was born in Hama in the 6th century.
Two main personalities from Hama were documented during Greek-Roman times. The first is Eustathius of Epiphaneia (), who was a Greek historian but all his works were lost. His most famous work was the &quot;Brief Chronicle&quot; (). The second personality is Euphrates the Stoic, who was from Epiphaneia according to Stephanus of Byzantium.

===Early Islamic period===

Hama was conquered by Muslim forces under Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah in 638 or 639, during the Muslim conquest of Syria. The town thereafter regained its ancient name and has since retained it. Little is known about Hama during the early Muslim period. After its capitulation to the Muslims, it became administratively part of Jund Hims (the military district of Homs), remaining as such through the 10th century. During Umayyad rule (661–750), it contained a congregational mosque, likely erected on the remains of a Byzantine-era church, parts of which were utilized in the mosque&#x27;s construction.

Under Abbasid rule (750–late 9th century), the caliph al-Mahdi () restored the mosque. During the reign of Caliph al-Mu&#x27;tadid (), Hama was large, walled trading town. On 29 November 903, the army of al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s successor, Caliph al-Muktafi, defeated the Qarmatians, an Isma&#x27;ili Shia movement embraced by many Bedouin in the Syrian Desert, at the Battle of Hama, ending their dominance of the Syrian Desert. 

In 944, the Hamdanids under Sayf al-Dawla captured the northern Syrian city of Aleppo and by the following year expanded their control to Jund Hims. Hama was thus incorporated into the Hamdanid emirate of Aleppo. (Writing in 985, the Jerusalemite geographer al-Muqaddasi noted the city had become a part of Jund Qinnasrin (the military district of northern Syria); the &quot;junds&quot; had become nominal administrative divisions by this point). Hama remained in the orbit of Aleppo until the 12th century. These were considered the &#x27;dark years&#x27; of Hama as the local rulers of northern and southern Syria struggled for dominance in the region. The Byzantines under emperor Nicephorus Phocas raided the town in 968 and burned the Great Mosque. By the 11th century, the Fatimids gained suzerainty over northern Syria and during this period, the Aleppo-based Mirdasids sacked Hama. The Persian geographer Nasir Khusraw noted in 1047 that Hama was &quot;well populated&quot; and stood on the banks of the Orontes River.

===Middle Islamic period===
The Crusader Tancred, Prince of Galilee, took Hama in 1108, but in 1114 the Crusaders lost it definitively to the Seljuks, during the reign of Toghtekin, atabeg of Damascus. By 1154, the Zengid ruler of Aleppo, Nur al-Din conquered Damascus and thus brought Muslim Syria, including Hama, under his control (the coastal regions were under Crusader rule). In 1157 two earthquakes cumulatively shattered the city and caused immense damage to the neighboring towns of Maarrat al-Numan, Shaizar and Kafartab. The first earthquake, on 13 July, left Hama partly in ruins and repairs were undertaken by Nur al-Din to the city&#x27;s walls in early August to prevent Crusader forces from taking advantage of its damaged state. The more severe earthquake, on 12 August, collapsed most of the town, its fortress and citadel, and all its large residences, which were clustered around the Orontes, killing most of Hama&#x27;s inhabitants. Afterward, the citadel walls and the Hassanayn Mosque were rebuilt; a surviving inscription on a small mosque south of the citadel notes that structure was rebuilt after its destruction in the 1157 earthquake. In 1172, Nur al-Din built the city&#x27;s current Great Mosque with a tall, square minaret. 

In 1175, Hama was taken from the Zengids by Saladin. He granted the city to his nephew, al-Muzaffar Umar, four years later, putting it under the rule of his Ayyubid family. This ushered in an era of stability and prosperity in Hama as the Ayyubids ruled it almost continuously until 1342. Geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi, who was born in Hama, described it in 1225 as a large town surrounded by a strongly built wall. Hama was sacked by the Mongols in 1260, as were most other Syrian cities, but the Mongols were defeated that same year and then again in 1303 by the Mamluks who succeeded the Ayyubids as rulers of the region. Hama briefly passed to Mamluk control in 1299 after the death of governor al-Mansur Mahmoud II. However, unlike other former Ayyubid cities, the Mamluks reinstated Ayyubid rule in Hama by making Abu al-Fida, the historian and geographer, governor of the city and he reigned from 1310 to 1332. He described his city as &quot;very ancient... mentioned in the book of the Israelites. It is one of the pleasantest places in Syria.&quot; After his death, he was succeeded by his son al-Afdal Muhammad who eventually lost Mamluk favor and was deposed. Thus, Hama came under direct Mamluk control.

Hama grew prosperous during the Ayyubid period, as well as the Mamluk period. It gradually expanded to both banks of the Orontes River, with the suburb on the right bank being connected to the town proper by a newly built bridge. The town on the left bank was divided into upper and lower parts, each of which was surrounded by a wall. The city was filled with palaces, markets, mosques, &quot;madrasas&quot;, and a hospital, and over thirty different sized norias (water-wheels). In addition, there stood a massive citadel in Hama. Moreover, a special aqueduct brought drinking water to Hama from the neighboring town of Salamiyah.

Ibn Battuta visited Hama in 1335 and remarked that the Orontes River made the city &quot;pleasant to live in, with its many gardens full of trees and fruits.&quot; He also speaks of a large suburb called al-Mansuriyyah (named after an Ayyubid emir) that contained &quot;a fine market, a mosque, and bathes.&quot; In 1400, Timurlane took Hama, along with nearby Homs and Baalbek.

===Ottoman rule===

The prosperous period of Mamluk rule came to an end in 1516, when the Ottoman Turks conquered Syria from the Mamluks after defeating them at the Battle of Marj Dabiq near Aleppo. Hama, and the rest of Syria, came under Ottoman rule from Constantinople. Under the Ottomans, Hama gradually became more important in the administrative structure of the region. It was first made capital of one of the &quot;liwas&quot; (&quot;districts&quot;) of the &quot;eyalet&quot; (&quot;province&quot;) of Tripoli. Hama once again became an important center for trade routes running east from the Mediterranean coast into Asia. A number of &quot;khans&quot; (&quot;caravansaries&quot;) were built in the city, like Khan Rustum Pasha which dates from 1556. The governor of Hama was tasked in 1692 with settling Turkoman nomads in the Hama-Homs region under the aegis of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s tribal settlement program.

Then in the 18th century, it became a part of the holdings of the governor of Damascus. The governors of Damascus at this time were the Azems, who also ruled other parts of Syria, for the Ottomans. They erected sumptuous residences in Hama, including the Azem Palace and Khan As&#x27;ad Pasha which were built by As&#x27;ad Pasha al-Azem, who governed Hama for a number of years until 1742. By then, there were 14 caravansaries in the city, mostly used for the storage and distribution of seeds, cotton, wool, and other commodities. After the passing of the Vilayet Law in 1864, Hama became the capital of the Sanjak of Hama (gaining the city more administrative powers), part of the larger vilayet of Sham.

===Modern history===

Ottoman rule ended in 1918, after their defeat in World War I to the Allied Forces. Hama was made part of the French Mandate of Syria. By then, Hama had developed into what it has remained: a medium-sized provincial town, important as the market for an agricultural area abundant in cereals, but also cotton and sugar beets. It gained notoriety as the center of large estates worked by peasants and dominated by a few magnate families. The 1925 Hama uprising occurred in the city during the Great Syrian Revolt against the French.

During the French Mandate, the district of Hama contained within its bounds the municipality of Hama and 114 villages. By an estimate in 1930, only four of these villages were owned outright by local cultivators, while sharing ownership of two villages with a notable family. Thus, the hinterland was owned by landowning elites. Starting in the late 1940s, significant class conflict erupted as agricultural workers sought reform in Hama.

Syria gained full independence from France in 1946. Akram al-Hawrani, a member of an impoverished notable family in Hama, began to agitate for land reform and better social conditions. He made Hama the base of his Arab Socialist Party, which later merged with another socialist party, the Ba&#x27;ath. This party&#x27;s ascent to power in 1963 signalled the end of power for the landowning elite.

The political insurgency by Sunni Islamic groups, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood, occurred in the city, which was reputed as a stronghold of conservative Sunni Islam. As early as the spring of 1964, Hama became the epicentre of an uprising by conservative forces, encouraged by speeches from mosque preachers, denouncing the policies of the Ba&#x27;ath. The Syrian government sent tanks and troops into the quarters of Hama&#x27;s old city to put down the insurrection.

In the early 1980s, Hama had emerged as a major source of opposition to the Ba&#x27;ath government during the Sunni armed Islamist uprising, which had begun in 1976. The city was a focal point for bloody events in the 1981 massacre and the most notable 1982 Hama massacre. The most serious insurrection of the Syrian Islamist uprising happened in Hama during February 1982, when Government forces, led by the president&#x27;s brother, Rifaat al-Assad, quelled the revolt in Hama with very harsh means. Tanks and artillery shelled the neighbourhoods held by the insurgents indiscriminately, and government forces are alleged to have executed thousands of prisoners and civilian residents after subduing the revolt, which became known as the Hama massacre. The story is suppressed and regarded as highly sensitive in Syria. The Hama massacre led to the military term &quot;Hama Rules&quot; meaning the complete large-scale destruction of a military objective or target.

===Syrian civil war===
The city was the site of one of the largest protest movements during the Syrian uprising. However, there was minimal armed conflict-mostly in the early stages of armed uprising-and the city remained under the control of the regular army for most of the war.

On 30 November 2024, in the wake of the Battle of Aleppo, Syrian government forces retreated as opposition forces began to push toward the city. A few days later, on 5 December, the Syrian Salvation Government led by Tahrir al-Sham captured the city from the Bashar al-Assad government after taking the control of the city of Aleppo a week before.

==Climate==
Its climate is classified as semi-arid (BSk) in Köppen-Geiger system. Hama&#x27;s inland location ensures that it receives no softening coastal influences and breezes from the Mediterranean Sea. As a result, the city has a much hotter and drier climate than nearby Homs.

==Demographics==
According to Josiah C. Russel, during the 12th century, Hama had a population of 6,750. James Reilly accounts the historical population as: 1812– 30,000 (Burckhardt) 1830– 20,000 (Robinson) 1839– 30–44,000 (Bowring) 1850– 30,000 (Porter) 1862– 10–12,000 (Guys) 1880– 27,656 (Parliamentary Papers) 1901– 60,000 (Parliamentary Papers) 1902–1907 80,000 (Trade Reports) 1906– 40,000 (al-Sabuni) 1909– 60,000 (Trade Reports)
In 1932, while Hama was under the French Mandate, there were approximately 50,000 residents. In the 1960 census, there were 110,000 inhabitants. The population continued to rise, reaching 180,000 in 1978 and 273,000 in 1994. The infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births in the Hama Governorate was 99.4. A 2005 estimate had Hama&#x27;s population at around 325,000 inhabitants.

Most of the residents are Sunni Muslims (including mostly Arabs, Kurds, and Turkmen), although some districts of the city are exclusively Christian. Hama is reputed to be the most conservative Sunni Muslim city in Syria since French Mandate times. During that period there was an old saying reflecting this characteristic: &quot;In Damascus, it takes only three men to make a political demonstration, while in Hama it takes only three men to get the town to pray.&quot; The Christian population mostly adheres to the Greek Orthodox Church or the Syriac Orthodox Church.

The city also contains a Palestinian refugee camp, known as Hama camp.

===Ecclesiastical status===
The Greek Orthodox Church has a prelacy in Hama under the Patriarch of Antioch. Hama is still a Roman Catholic titular see (referred to as &quot;Hamath&quot; or Amath&quot;), suffragan of Apamea. It is as &quot;Epiphania&quot; that it is best known in ecclesiastical documents. Lequien mentions nine Greek bishops of Epiphania. The first of them, whom he calls Mauritius, is the Manikeios whose signature appears in the First Council of Nicaea. Currently, it has two Catholic archbishops, a Greek Melkite and a Syrian, the former residing at Labroud, the latter at Homs, reuniting the titles of Homs (Emesus) and Hamah.

==Main sights==

Hama&#x27;s most famous attractions are the 17 Norias of Hama (), dating back to the Byzantine times. Fed by the Orontes river, they are up to in diameter. The largest &quot;noria&quot;s are the &quot;al-Mamunye&quot; (1453) and the &quot;al-Muhammediye&quot; (14th century). Originally they were used to route water into aqueducts, which led into the town and the neighbouring agricultural areas.

&quot;Other sights include:&quot;
*Hama museum, housed in an 18th-century Ottoman governor&#x27;s residence (&quot;Azem&quot; Palace), exhibiting remains of a Roman mosaic from Maryamin (4th century AD)
*&quot;al-Nuri&quot; mosque, renovated in 1163 by Nur ad-Din after the earthquake of 1157.
*Mamluk &quot;al-Izzi&quot; mosque (15th century)
*Mosque and Mausoleum of Abu al-Fida, an Ayyubid historian who was also governor of the city.
*&quot;al-Hasanain&quot; mosque, also rebuilt by Nur ad-Din after the earthquake
* Great Mosque of Hama, rebuilt after 1982 bombardment, incorporating elements from the ancient and Christian structures upon which it was founded.

<text>The Qing dynasty (1644–1912) was a Manchu-led imperial Chinese dynasty and the last imperial dynasty of China. It was officially proclaimed in 1636 in Shenyang in what is now Northeast China, but only captured Beijing and succeeded the Ming dynasty in China proper in 1644. The Qing dynasty collapsed when the imperial clan (surnamed Aisin Gioro) abdicated in February 1912, a few months after a military uprising had started the Xinhai Revolution that led to the foundation of the Republic of China.

Nurhaci (1559–1626), khan of the Jurchens, founded the Later Jin dynasty in 1616 in reference to the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty (1115–1234) that had once ruled over northern China. His son and successor Hong Taiji (1592–1643) renamed his people &quot;Manchu&quot; in 1635 and changed the name of Nurhaci&#x27;s state from &quot;Great Jin&quot; to &quot;Great Qing&quot; in 1636. Hong Taiji was the real founder of Qing imperial institutions. He was the first to adopt the title of &quot;emperor&quot; (&quot;huangdi&quot;) and founded an Imperial Ancestral Temple in the Qing capital Mukden in 1636. After the Qing captured Beijing in 1644 and appropriated the Ming Ancestral Temple, from 1648 on, Nurhaci was worshiped there as &quot;Taizu&quot; (太祖), a temple name usually accorded to dynastic founders. Qing emperors since Hong Taiji were also referred to as Bogda Khan by the Mongol subjects, and as &quot;Chinese khagan&quot; by their Turkic Muslim subjects when Qing rule extended to Xinjiang in the 18th century.

Like their Ming (1368–1644) predecessors—but unlike the emperors of earlier dynasties like the Han, Tang, and Song—Qing emperors used only one era name (&quot;Shunzhi&quot;, &quot;Qianlong&quot;, &quot;Guangxu&quot;, etc.) for their entire reign, and are most commonly known by that name. Starting with Nurhaci, there were twelve Qing rulers. Following the capture of Beijing and re-enthronement as Emperor of China in 1644, the Shunzhi Emperor (r. 1643/4–1661) became the first of the ten Qing sovereigns to rule over China proper. At 61 years, the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661–1722) was the longest, though his grandson, the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735–1796), would have reigned even longer if he had not purposely ceded the throne to the Jiaqing Emperor (r. 1796–1820) in order not to reign longer than his grandfather. Qing emperors succeeded each other from father to son until the Tongzhi Emperor (r. 1861–1875), the 11th Qing ruler, died childless in 1875. The last two emperors were chosen by Empress Dowager Cixi from other branches of the imperial clan.

==Succession==
Unlike the Ming emperors, who named their eldest legitimate son heir apparent whenever possible and forbade other sons from participating in politics, the Qing monarchs did not choose their successors according to primogeniture. When in 1622 Nurhaci (1559–1626) was asked which one of his sons he had chosen to succeed him as khan of the Jurchens, he refused to answer, telling his sons that they should determine after his death who among them was the most qualified leader. His answer reflected the fact that in Jurchen society, succession as tribal chieftain was usually determined by merit, not descent. When Nurhaci died in 1626, a committee of Manchu princes selected Hong Taiji (1592–1643) as his successor. Hong Taiji&#x27;s death in 1643 caused another succession crisis, because many of Nurhaci&#x27;s other sons appeared to be qualified leaders. As a compromise, the Manchu princes chose Hong Taiji&#x27;s four-year-old son Fulin (the Shunzhi Emperor, r. 1643–1661) as his successor, marking the adoption of father-son succession in the Qing imperial line.

The Shunzhi Emperor, who died of smallpox in 1661, chose his third son Xuanye as successor because he had survived smallpox. That child reigned as the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661–1722), who for the first time in Qing history followed the Chinese habit of primogeniture and appointed his eldest son Yinreng (1674–1725) as heir apparent. The heir apparent was removed twice because of his extravagance and abhorrent behavior, which included an attempt to assassinate the emperor. After Yinreng was demoted for good in 1712, the emperor refused to name an heir. Because Qing policy forced imperial princes to reside in the capital Beijing, many princes became involved in politics, and the Kangxi succession became particularly contested. After the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s death in 1722, his fourth son Yinzhen (1678–1735) emerged as victor and reigned as the Yongzheng Emperor, but his legitimacy was questioned for years after his accession.

To avoid such struggles in the future, the Yongzheng Emperor designed a system by which the living emperor would choose his successor in advance and on merit, but would keep his choice secret until his deathbed. The name of the future emperor was sealed in a casket that was hidden behind a panel in the rafters of the Qianqing Palace inside the Forbidden City. As successor, the Yongzheng Emperor chose his fourth son Hongli (1711–1799), the Qianlong Emperor, who himself selected his 15th son Yongyan, the Jiaqing Emperor (r. 1796–1820). The latter chose his successor Minning (1782–1850), the Daoguang Emperor, in 1799, but only read his testament shortly before dying.

When the Tongzhi Emperor died heirless in 1875, his mother Empress Dowager Cixi was the one who selected the next emperor. But instead of making the deceased emperor adopt an heir from the generation below himself (in this case this would have been a nephew of the Tongzhi Emperor) as the rules of imperial succession dictated, she picked one from the same generation. The new emperor was Zaitian (the Guangxu Emperor; 1871–1908), the son of Prince Chun, a half-brother of Empress Dowager Cixi&#x27;s late husband, the Xianfeng Emperor (r. 1850–1861). She assured her opponents that as soon as the new emperor had a son, he would be adopted into the Tongzhi Emperor&#x27;s line. However, as the Guangxu Emperor died heirless too, Empress Dowager Cixi also chose his successor, Puyi, in 1908.

==Regents and empresses dowager==
Qing succession and inheritance policies made it difficult for empresses and their relatives to build power at court, as they had in the Han dynasty for example. Threats to imperial power usually came from within the imperial clan. When the young Fulin was chosen to succeed his father Hong Taiji in September 1643, two &quot;prince regents&quot; were selected for him: Hong Taiji&#x27;s half-brother Dorgon (1612–1650) and Nurhaci&#x27;s nephew Jirgalang (1599–1655). Soon after the Manchus had seized Beijing under Dorgon&#x27;s leadership in May 1644, Dorgon came to control all important government matters. Official documents referred to him as &quot;Imperial Uncle Prince Regent&quot; (&quot;Huang shufu shezheng wang&quot; 皇叔父攝政王), a title that left him one step short of claiming the throne for himself. A few days after his death, he received a temple name (Chengzong 成宗) and an honorific posthumous title (Yi Huangdi 義皇帝, &quot;Righteous Emperor&quot;), and his spirit tablet was placed in the Imperial Ancestral Temple next to those of Nurhaci and Hong Taiji. In early March 1651 after Dorgon&#x27;s supporters had been purged from the court, these titles were abrogated.

The reign of the Shunzhi Emperor ended when he died of smallpox in 1661 at the age of 22. His last will—which was tampered and perhaps even forged by its beneficiaries—appointed four co-regents for his son and successor the six-year-old Xuanye, who was to reign as the Kangxi Emperor. All four were Manchu dignitaries who had supported the Shunzhi Emperor after the death of Dorgon, but their Manchu nativist measures reversed many of the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s own policies. The &quot;Oboi regency&quot;, named after the most powerful of the four regents, lasted until 1669, when the Kangxi Emperor started his personal rule.

For almost 200 years, the Qing Empire was governed by adult emperors. In the last fifty years of the dynasty—from the death of the Xianfeng Emperor in 1861 to the final abdication of the child emperor Puyi in 1912—the imperial position again became vulnerable to the power of regents, empress dowagers, imperial uncles, and eunuchs. Empress Dowager Cixi (1835–1908) came to power through a coup that ousted eight regents who had been named by her husband, the Xianfeng Emperor. She controlled the government during the reigns of the Tongzhi (r. 1861–1875) and Guangxu (r. 1875–1908) emperors. From 1861 onwards, she was officially co-regent with Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an, but her political role increased so much that within a few years she was taking charge of most government matters. She became sole regent in 1881 after the death of Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an. With the assistance of eunuchs and Manchu princes, she remained regent until March 1889, when she finally let the Guangxu Emperor rule personally (he was then 17 years old). After she intervened to end the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform in September 1898, she had the emperor put under house arrest and held the reins of the Qing government until her death in 1908.

==Multiple appellations==

===Era name===
An emperor&#x27;s era name or reign name was chosen at the beginning of his reign to reflect the political concerns of the court at the time. A new era name became effective on the first day of the Chinese New Year after that emperor&#x27;s accession, which fell between 21 January and 20 February (inclusively) of the Gregorian calendar. Even if an emperor died in the middle of the year, his era name was used for the rest of that year before the next era officially began.

Like the emperors of the Ming dynasty, Qing monarchs used only one reign name and are usually known by that name, as when we speak of the &quot;Qianlong Emperor&quot; (r. 1735–1795) or the &quot;Guangxu Emperor&quot; (r. 1875–1908). Strictly speaking, referring to the Qianlong Emperor simply as &quot;Qianlong&quot; is wrong, because &quot;Qianlong&quot; was not that emperor&#x27;s own name but that of his reign era. For convenience sake, however, many historians still choose to call him Qianlong (though not &quot;Emperor Qianlong&quot;). The only Qing emperors who are not commonly known by their reign name are the first two: Nurhaci (r. 1616–1626), who is known by his personal name, and his son and successor Hong Taiji (r. 1626–1643), whose name was a title meaning &quot;prince Hong&quot;. Hong Taiji was the only Qing emperor to use two era names (see table).

Reign names are usually left untranslated, but some scholars occasionally gloss them when they think these names have a special significance. Historian Pamela Crossley explains that Hong Taiji&#x27;s first era name Tiancong 天聰 (&quot;abkai sure&quot; in Manchu) referred to a &quot;capacity to transform&quot; supported by Heaven, and that his second one Chongde 崇德 (&quot;wesihun erdemungge&quot;) meant the achievement of this transformation. The practice of translating reign names is not new: Jesuits who resided at the Qing court in Beijing in the 18th century translated &quot;Yongzheng&quot;—or its Manchu version &quot;Hūwaliyasun tob&quot;—as &quot;Concordia Recta&quot;.

An era name was used to record dates, usually in the format &quot;Reign-name Xth year, Yth month, Zth day&quot; (sometimes abridged as X/Y/Z by modern scholars). A Qing emperor&#x27;s era name was also used on the coins that were cast during his reign. Unlike in the Ming dynasty, the characters used in Qing reign names were taboo, that is, the characters contained in it could no longer be used in writing throughout the empire.

===Personal name===
As in previous dynasties, the emperor&#x27;s personal name became taboo after his accession. The use of &quot;xuan&quot; 玄 (&quot;mysterious&quot;, &quot;profound&quot;) in the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s personal name Xuanye (玄燁), for example, forced printers of Buddhist and Daoist books to replace this very common character with &quot;yuan&quot; 元 in all their books. Even the &quot;Daodejing&quot;, a Daoist classic, and the &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot;, a widely used primer, had to be reprinted with &quot;yuan&quot; instead of &quot;xuan&quot;. When the Yongzheng Emperor, whose generation was the first in which all imperial sons shared a generational character as in Chinese clans, acceded the throne, he made all his brothers change the first character of their name from &quot;Yin&quot; (胤) to &quot;Yun&quot; (允) to respect the taboo. Citing fraternal solidarity, his successor, the Qianlong Emperor, simply removed one stroke from his own name and let his brothers keep their own.

Later emperors found other ways to diminish the inconvenience of naming taboos. The Jiaqing Emperor (r. 1796–1820), whose personal name was Yongyan (永琰), replaced the very common first character of his personal name (&quot;yong&quot; 永, which means &quot;forever&quot;) with an obscure one (顒) with the same pronunciation. The Daoguang Emperor (r. 1820–1850) removed the character for &quot;continuous&quot; (綿) from his name and decreed that his descendants should henceforth all omit one stroke from their name. In accordance with Manchu practice, Qing emperors rarely used their clan name Aisin Gioro.

===Posthumous titles===

====Temple name====
After their deaths, the emperors were given a temple name and an honorific name under which they would be worshiped at the Imperial Ancestral Temple. On the spirit tablets that were displayed there, the temple name was followed by the honorific name, as in &quot;Shizu Zhang huangdi&quot; for the Shunzhi Emperor and &quot;Taizong Wen huangdi&quot; for Hong Taiji. As dynastic founder, Nurhaci (&quot;Taizu&quot;) became the focal ancestor in the main hall of the temple. The earlier paternal ancestors of the Qing imperial line were worshiped in a back hall. Historical records like the &quot;Veritable Records&quot; (), which were compiled at the end of each reign, retrospectively referred to emperors by their temple names.

Hong Taiji created the Qing ancestral cult in 1636 when he assumed the title of emperor. Taking the Chinese imperial cult as a model, he named his main paternal ancestors &quot;kings&quot; and built an Imperial Ancestral Temple in his capital Mukden to offer sacrifices to them. When the Qing took control of Beijing in 1644, Prince Regent Dorgon had the Aisin Gioro ancestral tablets installed in what had been the Ming ancestral temple. In 1648 the Qing government bestowed the title of &quot;emperor&quot; to these ancestors and gave them the honorific posthumous names and temple names by which they were known for the rest of the dynasty. Nurhaci was identified retrospectively as Taizu (&quot;grand progenitor&quot;), the usual name given to a dynasty&#x27;s first emperor. This is why Nurhaci is considered as the first Qing ruler even if he was never emperor in his lifetime. Taizong was the usual name for the second emperor of a dynasty, and so Hong Taiji was canonized as Qing Taizong. The last emperor of a dynasty usually did not receive a temple name because his descendants were no longer in power when he died, and thus could not perpetuate the ancestral cult. Puyi, the last Qing monarch, reigned as the Xuantong Emperor from 1908 to 1912, but did not receive a temple name.

====Honorific posthumous name====
After death emperors were given an honorific posthumous title that reflected their ruling style. Nurhaci&#x27;s posthumous name was originally the &quot;Martial Emperor&quot; (武皇帝 &quot;wǔ huángdì&quot;)—to reflect his military exploits—but in 1662 it was changed to &quot;Highest Emperor&quot; (高皇帝 &quot;gāo huángdì&quot;), that is, &quot;the emperor from whom all others descend.&quot; Hong Taiji&#x27;s posthumous name, the &quot;Emperor of Letters&quot; (M.: &quot;šu hūwangdi&quot;; Ch.: 文皇帝 &quot;wén huángdì&quot;), was chosen to reflect the way in which he metamorphosed Qing institutions during his reign.

==List of emperors==

The emperors were usually enthroned on an auspicious day soon after the death of the previous monarch. With two exceptions (Jiaqing and Guangxu), they reigned under their predecessor&#x27;s era name until the following New Year. The date that appears under &quot;Dates of reign&quot; indicates the first day of the lunisolar year following the death of the previous emperor, which is when the new emperor&#x27;s era name came into use. The number of years indicated in the same column is the number of years in which that era name was used. Because of discrepancies between the western and the Chinese calendar, this number does not perfectly correspond to the number of years in which an emperor was on the throne.

Since posthumous titles and temple names were often shared by emperors of different dynasties, to avoid confusion they are usually preceded by the dynastic name. The Qianlong emperor, for instance, should be referred to as Qing Gaozong rather than just Gaozong. Because each emperor&#x27;s posthumous name was extremely long—that of the Shunzhi Emperor, for instance, was &quot;Titian longyun dingtong jianji yingrui qinwen xianwu dade honggong zhiren chunxiao Zhang huangdi&quot; 體天隆運定統建極英睿欽文顯武大德弘功至仁純孝章皇帝—the table only shows the short form.

<text>Pyongan Province (; ) was one of Eight Provinces of Korea during the Joseon dynasty. Pyongan was located in the northwest of Korea. The provincial capital was Pyongyang.

==History==
Pyongan Province was formed in 1413. Its name derived from the names of two of its principal cities, Pyongyang () and Anju ().

In 1895, the province was replaced by the Districts of Ganggye () in the northeast, Uiju County () in the northwest, and Pyongyang () in the south.

In 1896, Kanggye and Ŭiju Districts were reorganized into North Pyongan Province, and Pyongyang District was reorganized as South Pyongan Province. North and South Pyongan Provinces are part of North Korea.

==Geography==
Pyongan was bounded on the east by Hamgyong Province, on the south by Hwanghae Province, on the west by the Yellow Sea, and on the north by Qing China.

The regional name for the province was Kwanso.

<text>Jack pine (&quot;Pinus banksiana&quot;), also known as grey pine or scrub pine, is a North American pine.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Its native range in Canada is east of the Rocky Mountains from the Mackenzie River in the Northwest Territories to Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, and the north-central and northeast of the United States from Minnesota to Maine, with the southernmost part of the range just into northwest Indiana and northwest Pennsylvania.

== Taxonomy ==
In the far west of its range, &quot;Pinus banksiana&quot; hybridizes readily with the closely related lodgepole pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot;). The species epithet &quot;banksiana&quot; is after the English botanist Sir Joseph Banks.

== Description ==
&quot;Pinus banksiana&quot; ranges from in height. Some jack pines are shrub-sized, due to poor growing conditions. They do not usually grow perfectly straight, resulting in an irregular shape similar to pitch pine (&quot;Pinus rigida&quot;). This pine often forms pure stands on sandy or rocky soil. Many populations are adapted to stand-replacing fires, with the cones remaining closed for many years, until a forest fire kills the mature trees and opens the cones, reseeding the burnt ground. Other populations have not been shaped by regular stand-replacing fires and have reduced serotiny. A population on the Maine coast is apparently not reliant on fire for reproduction, and some stands have developed several age classes. Populations with lower serotiny are often found on soils that are in some way limiting to faster-growing competition, such as soils shallow to bedrock, shallow to water table, or very young soils.

Its leaves are needle-shaped, evergreen, in fascicles of two, needle-like, straight or slightly twisted, stiff, sharp-pointed, light yellowish-green, spread apart; edges toothed and long. The bundle-sheath is persistent. The buds are blunt pointed, up to 15 mm long, reddish-brown, and resinous. On vigorous shoots, there is more than one cyclic component. The bark is thin, reddish-brown to gray in color in juvenile stages. As the tree matures it becomes dark brown and flaky. The wood is moderately hard and heavy, weak, light brown colour. The seed cones vary in shape, being rectangular to oval, cone shaped, straight or curved inward. The cones are long, the scales with a small, fragile prickle that usually wears off before maturity, leaving the cones smooth.

Unusually for a pine, the cones normally point forward along the branch, sometimes curling around it. That is an easy way to tell it apart from the similar lodgepole pine in more western areas of North America. The cones on many mature trees are serotinous. They open when exposed to intense heat, greater than or equal to . The typical case is in a fire, however cones on the lower branches can open when temperatures reach due to the heat being reflected off the ground.

== Ecology ==
Kirtland&#x27;s warbler (&quot;Setophaga kirtlandii&quot;), a formerly endangered bird, depends on pure stands of young jack pine in a very limited area in the north of the Lower and Upper Peninsulas of Michigan for breeding. Most known nesting areas are limited to Crawford, Oscoda, and Ogemaw counties. Mature jack pine forests are usually open and blueberries are often abundant in the understory.

Young jack pines are an alternate host for sweet fern blister rust (&quot;Cronartium comptoniae&quot;). Infected sweet ferns (&quot;Comptonia peregrina&quot;) release powdery orange spores in the summer and nearby trees become infected in the fall. Diseased trees show vertical orange cankers on the trunk and galls on the lower branches. The disease does not tend to affect older trees.

Jack pines are also susceptible to scleroderris canker (&quot;Gremmeniella abietina&quot;). This disease manifests by yellowing at the base of the needles. Prolonged exposure may lead to eventual death of the tree.

Insects that attack jack pine stands include the white pine weevil (&quot;Pissodes strobi&quot;), jack pine sawfly, and jack pine budworm (&quot;Choristoneura pinus&quot;).

Fossil evidence shows the jack pine survived the glacial period in the Appalachian and Ozark Mountains.

== Commercial uses ==
Like other species of pine, &quot;Pinus banksiana&quot; has use as timber, although its wood tends to be knotty and not highly resistant to decay. Products include pulpwood, fuel, decking, and utility poles.

<text>The Hama massacre () occurred in February 1982 when the Syrian Arab Army and the Defense Companies paramilitary force, under the orders of President Hafez al-Assad, besieged the town of Hama for 27 days in order to quell an uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood against the Ba&#x27;athist government. The campaign that had begun in 1976 by Sunni Muslim groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood, was brutally crushed in an anti-Sunni massacre at Hama, carried out by the Syrian Arab Army and Alawite militias under the command of Major General Rifaat al-Assad.

Prior to the start of operations, Hafez al-Assad issued orders to seal off Hama from the outside world; effectively imposing a media blackout, total shut down of communications, electricity and food supplies to the city for months. Initial diplomatic reports from Western countries stated that 1,000 were killed. Subsequent estimates vary, with the lower estimates reporting at least 10,000 deaths, while others put the number at 20,000 (Robert Fisk) or 40,000 (Syrian Human Rights Committee and SNHR). The massacre remains the &quot;single deadliest act&quot; of violence perpetrated by an Arab state upon its own population in the history of the Modern Middle East.

Nearly two-thirds of the city was destroyed in the Ba&#x27;athist military operation. Robert Fisk, who was present at Hama during the events of the massacre, reported that indiscriminate bombing had razed much of the city to the ground and that the vast majority of the victims were civilians. Patrick Seale, reporting in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, described the operation as a &quot;two-week orgy of killing, destruction and looting&quot; which destroyed the city and killed a minimum of 25,000 inhabitants.

The attack has been described as a &quot;genocidal massacre&quot; which was motivated by sectarian animosities against the Sunni community of Hama. Memory of the massacre remains an important aspect of Syrian culture and as a result, it evokes strong emotions amongst Syrians to the present day. The Hama massacre was invoked by rebel leaders when Ba&#x27;athist government forces were driven out of the city following a successful rebel offensive in December 2024 that ultimately ended the rule of the Assad family over Syria, with rebel leaders saying they have &quot;come to cleanse the wound that has persisted in Syria for 40 years&quot;.

==Background==


The Ba&#x27;ath Party of Syria, which advocates Ba&#x27;athism, the ideologies of Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, had clashed with the Muslim Brotherhood, a group which advocates a Sunni Islamist ideology, since 1940. The two groups were opposed in fundamental ways. The Ba&#x27;ath party was nominally secular and nationalist. The Muslim Brotherhood, like other Islamist groups, saw nationalism as un-Islamic and religion as inseparable from politics and government. Most Ba&#x27;ath party members were from humble, obscure backgrounds and favored radical economic policies, while Sunni Muslims had dominated the souqs and landed power of Syria, and tended to view government intervention in the economy as threatening their interests. Not all Sunni notables believed in fundamentalism, but even those who did not often saw the Brotherhood as a useful tool against the Ba&#x27;ath.
The town of Hama in particular was a &quot;stronghold of landed conservatism and of the Muslim Brothers,&quot; and &quot;had long been a redoubtable opponent of the Ba&#x27;athist state.&quot; The first full-scale clash between the two occurred shortly after the 1963 coup, in which the Ba&#x27;ath party first gained power in Syria. In April 1964, riots broke out in Hama, where Muslim insurgents put up &quot;roadblocks, stockpiled food and weapons, ransacked wine shops.&quot; After an Ismaili Ba&#x27;ath militiaman was killed, riots intensified and rebels attacked &quot;every vestige&quot; of the Ba&#x27;ath party in Hama. Tanks were brought in to crush the rebellion and 70 members of the Muslim Brotherhood died, with many others wounded or captured, and still more disappearing underground.

After the clashes in Hama, the situation periodically erupted into clashes between the government and various Islamic sects. However, a more serious challenge occurred after the Syrian invasion of Lebanon in 1976. In October 1980, Muhammad al-Bayanuni, a respected member of the religious hierarchy of Aleppo, became the Islamic Front&#x27;s Secretary-General, but its leading light remained &#x27;Adnan Sa&#x27;d al-Din, the General Supervisor of the Muslim Brothers. The chief ideologue of the Islamic Front was a prominent religious scholar from Hama, Sa&#x27;id Hawwa, who along with Sa&#x27;d al-Din had been a leader of the northern militants during the mid-1970s. Anti-regime activists such as Marwan Hadid and Muhammad al-Hamid were also carefully listened to.

From 1976 to 1982, Sunni Islamists fought the Ba&#x27;ath Party-controlled government of Syria in what has been called a &quot;long campaign of terror&quot;. In 1979, the Brotherhood undertook guerrilla activities in multiple cities within the country targeting military officers and government officials. The resulting government repression included abusive tactics, torture, mass arrests, and a number of selective assassinations, particularly of prominent mosque preachers. In July 1980, the ratification of Law No. 49 made membership in the Muslim Brotherhood a capital offence.

Throughout the first years of the 1980s, the Muslim Brotherhood and various other Islamist factions staged hit-and-run and bomb attacks against the government and its officials, including a nearly successful attempt to assassinate President Hafez al-Assad on 26 June 1980, during an official state reception for the President of Mali. When a machine-gun salvo missed him, al-Assad allegedly ran to kick a hand grenade aside, and his bodyguard (who survived and was later promoted to a much higher position) smothered the explosion of another one. Surviving with only light injuries, al-Assad&#x27;s revenge was swift and merciless: only hours later, a large number of imprisoned Islamists (reports say from 600 to 1,000 prisoners) were executed in their cells in Tadmor Prison (near Palmyra) by units loyal to the President&#x27;s brother, Rifaat al-Assad.

In an earlier massacre in 1981, over 300 residents of Hama were killed by the Baathist security forces.

==Attack by insurgents in Hama==
The events of the Hama massacre began at 2 am on 2 February 1982. An army unit searching the old city stumbled on the hideout of the local guerilla commander, Omar Jawwad (aka Abu Bakr), and was ambushed. Other insurgent cells were alerted by radio and &quot;roof-top snipers killed perhaps a score&quot; of Syrian soldiers. Reinforcements were rushed in to besiege Abu Bakr who then &quot;gave the order for a general uprising&quot; in Hama. Mosque loudspeakers used for the call to prayer called for jihad against the Ba&#x27;ath, and hundreds of Islamic insurgents rose to attack the homes of government officials and Baath Party leaders, overrun police posts and ransack armouries. They carried out attacks, especially in the northern cities, on government buildings, cooperative stores, police stations, and army units, and provoked demonstrations and large-scale shutdowns of shops and schools. The Brotherhood, having already benefited from training provided to Muslim militants in Iraqi army camps, was also assured of comprehensive assistance from Iraq in the form of weaponry and financial resources. By daybreak of the morning of 2 February, some 70 leading Ba&#x27;athists had been killed and the Islamist insurgents and other opposition activists proclaimed Hama a &quot;liberated city&quot;, urging Syrians to rise up against the &quot;infidel&quot;.

==Counter-attack by government forces==

According to author Patrick Seale, &quot;every party worker, every paratrooper sent to Hama knew that this time Islamic militancy had to be torn out of the city, whatever the cost&quot;. The military was mobilized, and President Hafez al-Assad sent Rifaat&#x27;s special forces (the Defense Companies), elite army units and Mukhabarat agents to the city. Before the attack, the Syrian government called for the city&#x27;s surrender and warned that anyone remaining in the city would be considered a rebel. Hama was besieged by 12,000 troops for three weeks – the first week spent &quot;in regaining control of the town&quot;, and the last two &quot;in hunting down the insurgents&quot;. Robert Fisk, a journalist who was in Hama midway through the battle, described civilians fleeing pervasive destruction.

According to Amnesty International, the Syrian military bombed the old city center from the air to facilitate the entry of infantry and tanks through the narrow streets; buildings were demolished by tanks during the first four days of fighting. Large parts of the old city were destroyed. There were also unsubstantiated reports of use of hydrogen cyanide by the government forces.

Rifaat&#x27;s forces ringed the city with artillery, shelled it, then combed the rubble for surviving Muslim Brotherhood members and supporters. Suspecting that rebels were still hiding in tunnels under the old city, he had diesel fuel pumped into them and stationed tanks at their entrances to shell fleeing militants. Alawite military units loyal to Rifaat al-Assad, such as the Defense Companies, entered the city and indiscriminately massacred thousands of Sunni civilian survivors.

The indiscriminate bombardment by government forces razed much of the city&#x27;s districts, streets, heritage sites, mosques and churches. The Azm Palace was severely damaged. Baathist paramilitaries continued looting for weeks and numerous families were rounded up and shot. Baathist dissident Akram al-Hawrani asserted that women, children and all Hama inhabitants irrespective of their political leanings were targeted indiscriminately during the regime onslaught. Even Ba&#x27;ath Party members, according to Hawrani, were victims of the &quot;savage slaughter&quot; ordered by Hafez al-Assad.

==Estimates of fatalities==
Initial diplomatic reports from western governments in 1982 had stated that 1,000 were killed in the fighting. Subsequent estimates of casualties varied from 10,000 to 40,000 people killed, including about 1,000 soldiers. Robert Fisk, who was in Hama shortly after the massacre, originally estimated fatalities at 10,000, but has since doubled the estimate to 20,000. Major General Rifaat al-Assad, the brother of President al-Assad, reportedly boasted of killing 38,000 people. Amnesty International initially estimated the death toll was between 10,000 and 25,000.

Reports by Syrian Human Rights Committee claimed &quot;over 25,000&quot; or between 30,000 and 40,000 people were killed. 
Twenty years later, Syrian journalist Subhi Hadidi, wrote that forces &quot;under the command of General Ali Haydar, besieged the city for 27 days, bombarding it with heavy artillery and tank [fire], before invading it and killing 30,000 or 40,000 of the city&#x27;s citizens – in addition to the 15,000 missing who have not been found to this day, and the 100,000 expelled.&quot; A report published by the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) on the 40th anniversary of the Hama massacre estimates that around 40,000 inhabitants were killed in the massacre; in addition to about 17,000 civilians who were disappeared and have not been found as of the present day.

==Aftermath==
Around two-thirds of the city was demolished in the military operations during the massacre. After the Hama massacre, the Islamic revolution was crushed, and since then, the Brotherhood has operated in exile and other opposition factions either surrendered or slipped into hiding. Government attitudes in Syria hardened considerably during the uprising, and President Assad would rely more on repression than he would rely on political tactics during the remainder of his rule, although an economic liberalization program was launched in the 1990s.

After the massacre, the already evident disarray in the insurgents&#x27; ranks increased, and the rebel factions experienced acrimonious internal splits. Particularly damaging to their cause was the deterrent effect of the massacre, as well as the realization that no Sunni uprisings had occurred in the rest of the country in support of the Hama rebels. Most of the members of the rebel groups either fled from the country or remained in exile, mainly in Iran, while others made their way to the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany. The Muslim Brotherhood—the largest opposition group—split into two factions, after giving up on armed struggle. One faction, more moderate than the other faction and recognized by the international Muslim Brotherhood, eventually headquartered itself in the UK, where it remains today, while the less moderate faction headquartered itself in Iran and retained a military structure for several years, with backing from the Iranian government, before it rejoined the London-based mainstream.

Internationally, the Hama massacre became a symbol of the al-Assad government&#x27;s human rights violations as well as a symbol of its brutal repression. Within Syria, mention of the massacre was strictly suppressed by the Assad regime; however, the general contours of the events—and various partisan versions, on all sides—are well known throughout the country. When the massacre was publicly referenced, it was only referenced as the &quot;events&quot; or it was referenced as the &quot;incident&quot; at Hama. In 2012, Professor Gregory Stanton of Genocide Watch characterized the Hama massacre as a &#x27;genocidal massacre&#x27;, and he also stated that its methods could prompt the regime to pursue future mass killings during the Syrian civil war (which was just beginning at the time).

Memory of the Hama Massacre has become an important aspect of Syrian culture and on an emotional level, it has evoked a strong feeling of resentment amongst Syrians to the present day. During the Syrian Revolution in 2011, older Syrians frequently warned younger activists about the Assad regime&#x27;s determination to &quot;&quot;do Hama again&quot;, i.e., its willingness to exterminate hundreds of thousands of civilians in order to ensure its survival. The satirical slogan &quot;Asad &#x27;alayya wa fil-hurubi na&#x27;amah&quot; (&quot;Against me a lion and in wars an ostrich&quot;...)&quot; became popular amongst Syrian dissidents for Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s comparatively muted response to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon the same year.

==Lawsuits==
In December 2013, human rights organization &quot;Trial International&quot; filed a criminal lawsuit against Rifaat al-Assad over his role as commander of Defense Brigades that organized the ground campaign of the massacre. Charges in the war-crimes lawsuit included organizing extrajudicial killings, large-scale torture, sexual violence, mass-rapes, summary executions and forced disappearances.

A criminal investigation was launched by the Swiss Office of the Attorney General the same year. Almost a decade later in August 2023, the Federal Criminal Court ordered the extradition of Rifa&#x27;at al-Assad, prompting Switzerland to issue an arrest warrant to prosecute him.

<doc id="516957" wikidata="Q426771" url="?curid=516957" title="Jaguar XK150">
<text>The Jaguar XK150 is a sports car produced by Jaguar between 1957 and 1961 as the successor to the XK140.

Initially it was only available in fixed head coupé (FHC) and drophead coupé (DHC) versions. The roadster without full weather equipment which had begun the XK line was launched as the XK150 OTS (open two-seater) in 1958. Minimal rear seats were fitted in the coupés. The open two-seater was fitted for the first time with wind-up windows in taller high-silled doors, but retained the very simple folding roof of its predecessors.

== History ==
Announced in its home market in May 1957 the XK150 bore a family resemblance to the XK120 and XK140 but was radically revised. Most visibly, a one-piece windscreen replaced the split screen, and the wing line carried higher and more streamlined at the doors. The widened bonnet opened down to the wings, and on the coupés the windscreen frame was moved forward to make passenger access easier. The car was available at various times in Red, Pearl Grey, White, Indigo Blue, Claret, Cotswold Blue, Black, Mist Grey, Sherwood Green, Carmen Red, British Racing Green, Cornish Grey, and Imperial Maroon.

The XK150&#x27;s dashboard came trimmed in leather, with walnut optional on all models. On the early drophead coupés, the aluminium centre dash panel, which was discontinued after June 1958, had an X pattern engraving similar to the early 3.8 E-Type. Thinner doors gave more interior space. A little red light reminded the driver that the front parking lights, located atop the wings (fenders), were on.

Suspension and chassis were very similar to the XK140, with manual-only rack and pinion steering. The 3.4 litre DOHC straight-6 XK engine was similar to the XK140&#x27;s, but a new &quot;B&quot; type cylinder head raised power to 180 SAE bhp at 5750 rpm.
The first closed and convertible XK150s were slower than their predecessors. After a twelve-month delay caused by the February 1957 factory fire, this deficit was corrected in the spring of 1958 with the March release of special equipment models fitted with disc brakes and more powerful SE engine. Twin SU HD6 carburettors and a modified B type cylinder head with larger exhaust valves improved performance to 210 SAE bhp at 5500 rpm. While most export cars were SE models, a third option for the open two-seater featured an &quot;S&quot; engine with three SU HD8 carburettors and a straight-port cylinder head boosting power to a claimed 250 SAE bhp.

In 1960 the 3.8 litre engine fitted in the full-sized luxury Mark IX saloon since October 1958 became available. It was tuned to produce up to in S models and propel an XK150 to and from 0–60 mph in around 7.0 seconds. Fuel economy was 18mpg. Four-wheel Dunlop disc brakes appeared for the first time as an option. Factory specification 6.00 × 16 inch Dunlop Road Speed tyres or optional 185VR16 Pirelli Cinturato CA67 radials could be fitted on either 16 × 5K½ solid wheels or optional 16 × 5K wire wheels.

The E-Type replacement was announced in the middle of March 1961.

== Production ==
Production ended in October 1960 with 9,382 vehicles, including 2,265 Roadsters open-two seater OTS, 4,445 Fixed head coupés FHC and 2,672 drop head coupés DHC.

== Engine specifications ==
== Performance ==
A 250 bhp 3.4 litre XK150S fixed-head coupé with limited slip differential was tested by &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1959. It had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 7.8 seconds. Fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £2110 including taxes of £623. It was at the time the fastest closed car the magazine had ever subjected to a full road test.

The bhp figures quoted are SAE gross and not SAE net horsepower ratings. In comparison, the 3.4L 1954 Jaguar &#x27;D&#x27;-type with racing camshafts, larger 1.875in. inlet valves, and 3 dual-choke Weber carburettors was rated at 246 bhp.

== Coachbuilt version ==

=== Jaguar XK150 By Bertone ===
A total of 3 bare chassis were sent to Bertone in Turin to be bodied as prototype fixed-head coupés. They were reportedly meant to be the replacement for the XK150 and wore an &quot;XKE&quot; badge on their rear flanks. Jaguar ended up replacing the XK150 with the E-Type.

<doc id="516962" wikidata="Q129758" url="?curid=516962" title="Third generation of video game consoles">
<text>In the history of video games, the third generation of video game consoles, commonly referred to as the 8-bit era, began on July 15, 1983, with the Japanese release of two systems: Nintendo&#x27;s Family Computer (commonly abbreviated to &quot;Famicom&quot;) and Sega&#x27;s SG-1000. When the Famicom was released outside of Japan, it was remodeled and marketed as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). This generation marked the end of the video game crash of 1983, and a shift in the dominance of home video game manufacturers from the United States to Japan. Handheld consoles were not a major part of this generation; the Game &amp; Watch line from Nintendo (which started in 1980) and the Milton Bradley Microvision (which came out in 1979) that were sold at the time are both considered part of the previous generation due to hardware typical of the second generation.

Improvements in technology gave consoles of this generation improved graphical and sound capabilities, comparable to golden age arcade games. The number of simultaneous colors on screen and the palette size both increased which, along with larger resolutions, more sprites on screen, and more advanced scrolling and pseudo-3D effects, which allowed developers to create scenes with more detail and animation. Audio technology improved and gave consoles the ability to produce a greater variation and range of sound. A notable innovation of this generation was the inclusion of cartridges with on-board memory and batteries to allow users to save their progress in a game, with Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; introducing the technology to the worldwide market. This innovation allowed for much more expansive gaming worlds and in-depth storytelling, since users could now save their progress rather than having to start each gaming session at the beginning. By the next generation, the capability to save games became ubiquitous—at first saving on the game cartridge itself and, later, when the industry changed to read-only optical disks, on memory cards, hard disk drives, and eventually cloud storage.

The best-selling console of this generation was the NES/Famicom from Nintendo, followed by the Master System from Sega (the successor to the SG-1000), and the Atari 7800. Although the previous generation of consoles had also used 8-bit processors, it was at the end of the third generation that home consoles were first labeled and marketed by their &quot;bits&quot;. This also came into fashion as fourth generation 16-bit systems like the Sega Genesis were marketed in order to differentiate between the generations. In Japan and North America, this generation was primarily dominated by the Famicom/NES, while the Master System dominated the Brazilian market, with the combined markets of Europe being more balanced in overall sales between the two main systems. The end of the third generation was marked by the emergence of 16-bit systems of the fourth generation and with the discontinuation of the Famicom on September 25, 2003. However, in some cases, the third generation still lives on as dedicated console units still use hardware from the Famicom specification, such as the VT02/VT03 and OneBus hardware.

== Overview ==
=== 1983–1984 ===
The Japanese video game market was still a growing &quot;wide open&quot; market for video game consoles in 1983. Japan had a relatively small console market, where only 300,000 consoles had been sold up until 1983, compared to the millions that had been sold in the United States up until then. A number of Japanese manufacturers attempted to compete for the &quot;wide open&quot; Japanese console market with their own consoles. The Epoch Cassette Vision, released in 1981, was the best-selling console in Japan at the time. It was followed by the Bandai Arcadia (priced ), a Japanese version of the Arcadia 2001 released in 1982, and the Atari 2800 (priced ), a Japanese version of the Atari 2600 marketed in May 1983.

The third generation of consoles began when two Japanese companies, Sega and Nintendo, decided to enter the console gaming market. On July 15, 1983, they both released new consoles in Japan, Sega&#x27;s SG-1000 and Nintendo&#x27;s Famicom. Both companies previously had success as arcade game companies. Sega, one of Japan&#x27;s largest arcade companies, was intending to compete in both the console and personal computer markets, with a home computer version called the SC-3000 released at the same time. Meanwhile, Nintendo focused on making the Famicom more powerful than competing home systems so that it would be comparable to their &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981) arcade video game hardware, while at the same time selling it for cheaper than the Cassette Vision, selling the Famicom for (about $150). Nintendo unveiled the Famicom shortly before the Tokyo Toy Show in June 1983, becoming a sensation among toy show exhibitors, prior to Sega unveiling the SG-1000 at the Tokyo Toy Show.

The Famicom went on to become very popular in Japan, where it quickly beat the Cassette Vision to become Japan&#x27;s all-time best-selling console. Sega would become Nintendo&#x27;s main competitor for console sales during the era. Sega&#x27;s SG-1000, which preceded Sega&#x27;s more commercially successful Master System, initially had little to distinguish itself from earlier consoles such as the ColecoVision and contemporary computers such as the MSX, although it was able to achieve advanced visual effects, including parallax scrolling in &quot;Orguss&quot; and sprite-scaling in &quot;Zoom 909&quot;.

To enter the worldwide market, Nintendo approached the American company Atari, which had the majority share of the home video game market in North America, with a proposal for Atari to license the Famicom and distribute it. An agreement was concluded, which was to be signed at the Consumer Electronics Show in July 1983. At the same CES, however, Coleco exhibited its Coleco Adam home computer, which featured a version of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. At that time, Atari had exclusive rights to distribute Nintendo games on home computers, and Coleco had exclusive rights to distribute the game on consoles. However, since Atari understood that Adam was a home computer, they postponed signing the agreement with Nintendo and asked the company to resolve the issue with rights. The problem was resolved, but during this time, the video game crash of 1983 had occurred and Atari began to lose influence in the market. With this, Nintendo had no competitor left and the company eventually decided to enter the market on its own.

=== 1984–1986 ===
Nintendo were initially discouraged after the crash, with Nintendo of America&#x27;s market research being met with warnings to stay away from home consoles and US retailers refusing to stock game consoles. As a result, Nintendo instead introduced the Famicom to North America in the form of an arcade hardware, the Nintendo VS. System, in 1984. It became a major success in North American arcades, giving Nintendo the confidence to release the Famicom in North America as a video game console, for which there was growing interest due to Nintendo&#x27;s positive reputation in the arcades.

The company introduced a version of the Famicom in January 1985 at the Winter CES as the Nintendo Advanced Video System, short for NAVS. The gamepads were wireless and worked with it using an infrared port, and the bundle would also include a light gun. It was planned that the NAVS would be available in the spring of 1985. However, this did not happen and the console was shown again at the summer CES in June of that year, as an updated version called the Nintendo Entertainment System. The system was released in October 1985 as an experiment within New York City bounds with &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; game bundled. The experiment was successful and showed that people still wanted to play games despite the 1983 crisis. After that the system was released in all North America in February 1986 at a price of US$159.

In 1985, Sega succeeded the SG-1000 with the Master System, which incorporated hardware scrolling, alongside an increased color palette, greater memory, pseudo-3D effects, and stereoscopic 3-D, gaining a clear hardware advantage over the NES. However, the NES continued to dominate the North American and Japanese markets, while the Master System had more success in the European and South American markets.

The Family Computer (commonly abbreviated the Famicom) became popular in Japan during this era, crowding out the other consoles in this generation. The Famicom&#x27;s Western counterpart, the Nintendo Entertainment System, dominated the gaming market in North America, thanks in part to its restrictive licensing agreements with developers. This marked a shift in the dominance of home video games from the United States to Japan, to the point that &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described the &quot;Nintendo craze&quot; as a &quot;non-event&quot; for American video game designers as &quot;virtually all the work to date has been done in Japan.&quot; The company had an estimated 65% of 1987 hardware sales in the console market; Atari Corporation had 24% (including the Atari 7800, 2600 Jr. and XEGS), Sega had 8%, and other companies had 3%.

=== 1986–2007 ===
The popularity of the Japanese consoles grew so quickly that in 1988 Epyx stated that, in contrast to a video game-hardware industry in 1984 that the company had described as &quot;dead&quot;, the market for Nintendo cartridges was larger than for all home-computer software. Nintendo sold seven million NES systems in 1988, almost as many as the number of units the Commodore 64 sold in its first five years. In 1988, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the rise of video game consoles had a positive impact on computer games, sales of which grew 37% during the first quarter of 1988. In 1989, however, &quot;Compute!&quot; reported that Nintendo&#x27;s popularity caused most computer-game companies to have poor sales during Christmas that year, resulting in serious financial problems for some, and after more than a decade making computer games, in 1989 Epyx converted completely to console cartridges. By 1990 30% of American households owned the NES, compared to 23% for all personal computers, and peer pressure to have a console was so great that even the children of computer-game developers demanded them despite parents&#x27; refusal and the presence of state-of-the-art computers and software at home. As &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reported in 1992, &quot;The kids who don&#x27;t have access to videogames are as culturally isolated as the kids in our own generation whose parents refused to buy a TV&quot;.

This era contributed many influential aspects to the history of the development of video games. The third generation saw the release of many of the first console role-playing video games (RPGs). Editing and censorship of video games was often used in localizing Japanese games to North America. It was during this time that many successful video game franchises began, which went onto to becoming mainstays of the video game industry. Some examples are &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, &quot;Metroid&quot;, &quot;Mega Man&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, &quot;Castlevania&quot;, &quot;Phantasy Star&quot;, &quot;Megami Tensei&quot;, &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, and &quot;Bomberman&quot;.

In Europe during the late 1980s, the Master System had a stronger start than the Nintendo Entertainment System in some areas, with NES sales lagging behind the Master System in the United Kingdom. By 1990, the Master System was the biggest-selling console in Europe, though the NES was beginning to have a fast-growing user base in the United Kingdom and this position had reversed by the end of the run of both consoles.

The third generation also saw the beginning of the children&#x27;s educational console market. Due to their reduced capacities, these systems typically were not labeled by their &quot;bits&quot; and were not marketed in competition with traditional video game consoles.

In North America, the Atari 7800 and Master System were discontinued in 1992, while the NES continued to be produced until 1995. In Europe, the Master System was discontinued in the late 1990s. However it has continued to sell in Brazil through to the present day. In Japan, Nintendo continued to repair Famicom systems until October 31, 2007.

== Home systems ==

=== SG-1000 ===

On July 15, 1983, the SG-1000 was released in Japan, the first console to be created by Sega. It was released alongside the Famicom, making them the first two consoles of the third generation. While it did not sell as well as other consoles of the generation, it was considered important to the development of Sega as a console manufacturer.

=== Famicom/Nintendo Entertainment System ===

The Famicom, released on July 15, 1983, in Japan and in the North American region in October 1985 as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), is an 8-bit cartridge-based console developed and marketed by Nintendo. It became the most popular console of the generation, selling over 60 million units. It was the first home system to feature a controller with a directional pad (designed by Gunpei Yokoi), which became an industry standard. While the NES was discontinued in North America on August 14, 1995, it was not until September 25, 2003, that the Famicom was discontinued in Japan.

=== Sega Mark III/Master System ===

The Sega Mark III was released on October 20, 1985, for the Japanese market and was the third iteration of the SG-1000. The name was changed to the Master System and the design altered for release outside of Japan. It was designed to be more powerful than the NES in an attempt to give it an edge over the competition but despite good sales, it did not match the success of the NES, making it the second best selling console of the generation. This was the case in all regions apart from Brazil, where it continued to sell for years after the end of the generation.

=== Atari 7800 ===

The Atari 7800 was released in May 1986 and was the successor to the Atari 5200. It was the first console to be backward compatible without additional hardware. It was originally due for launch on May 21, 1984, but due to the sale of the company the launch did not happen until two years later and, coupled with a small library of games, the console did not sell as well as the Master System or NES.

=== Comparison ===
===Other consoles===
=== Sales comparison ===
The NES/Famicom sold by far the most units of any third generation console, particularly in Japan and North America. In North America in 1989, between Nintendo and Sega, there was a 94% to 6% split in market share between the NES and the Master System, in Nintendo&#x27;s favor. The NES sold units in North America during 1986, much more than the Master System (125,000) and Atari 7800 (100,000) combined. By 1990, Nintendo had a 93% North American market share, followed by Sega with a 3.8% share, NEC with 1.3% and Atari with 1.1% share. Nintendo maintained its North American lead through 1991, when it had a market-share of 80% that year, much more than Atari (12%) and Sega (8%) combined. This was due to Nintendo&#x27;s strong lineup of both first-party titles (such as &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Metroid&quot;, &quot;Duck Hunt&quot;, and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;) and third-party titles along with Nintendo&#x27;s strict licensing rules that required NES titles to be exclusive to the console for two years after release, putting a damper on third-party support for other consoles.

In Europe, competition was much tougher for the NES, which was trailing behind the Master System up until 1990, despite the former&#x27;s hegemony of the North American and Japanese markets. NES sales began picking up from about 1990, after which sales were more evenly split between the NES and Master System through 1994; the NES eventually overtook the Master System in Western Europe by a narrow margin, though the Master System maintained its lead in several markets such as the United Kingdom, Belgium and Spain. In other regions, the Master System was the most successful console in Brazil, South Korea, and Australia, while the Dendy (a Taiwanese Famiclone of the NES/Famicom) was the most successful in the former Soviet Union.

<text>Hamgyong Province (; ) was one of the Eight Provinces of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty. Hamgyong was located in the northeast of Korea. The provincial capital was Hamhung.

==Names==
The province was first established as Yŏnggil () in 1413. It was renamed Hamgil () three years later. In 1470, it was renamed Yŏngan (). In 1509, it was renamed Hamgyŏng after its two principal cities, Hamhung and Kyongsong.

In the 18th century, this was transcribed via Chinese as Kyen-king and glossed as meaning &quot;the Happy&quot;. In the 19th century, it was transcribed as Ham-kieng.

Within Korea, the province was also referred to as &quot;Dongbuk&quot; (&quot;Northeast&quot;). The southern half of the province was also referred as &quot;Kwannam&quot;, and the northern half of the province was also referred as &quot;Kwanbuk&quot;.

==History==
Korea&#x27;s northeastern frontier was first organized into the province of Yonggil in 1413.

In 1895, the province was replaced by the districts () of Kyongsong in the northeast, Kapsan in the northwest, and Hamhŭng in the south.

In 1896, Kyŏngsŏng District was reorganized into North Hamgyŏng Province, and Kapsan and Hamhŭng Districts were reorganized into South Hamgyŏng Province. These divisions continue in present-day North Korea.

==Geography==
Hamgyŏng was bounded on the west by P&#x27;yŏngan, on the south by Hwanghae and Kangwŏn, on the east by the Sea of Japan, and on the north by Qing China and the Russian Empire.

<text>Henry Emmett Manush (July 20, 1901 – May 12, 1971), nicknamed &quot;Heinie&quot;, was an American baseball outfielder. He played professional baseball for 20 years from 1920 to 1939, including 17 years in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers (1923–1927), St. Louis Browns (1928–1930), Washington Senators (1930–1935), Boston Red Sox (1936), Brooklyn Dodgers (1937–1938), and Pittsburgh Pirates (1938–1939). After retiring as a player, Manush was a minor league manager from 1940 to 1945, a scout for the Boston Braves in the late 1940s and a coach for the Senators from 1953 to 1954. He also scouted for the expansion Senators in the early 1960s. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1964.

A native of Tuscumbia, Alabama, Manush was one of the best batters in baseball in the 1920s and 1930s. He compiled a .330 career batting average, won the American League batting championship in 1926 with a .378 batting average, finished one point short of a second batting championship in 1928, finished among the top four batters in the American League six times (1926, 1928–1929, and 1932–1934) and totaled more than 200 hits four times (1928–1929, 1932–1933). In 1928, he finished second in the voting for the American League Most Valuable Player (MVP) award after leading the American League with 241 hits and 47 doubles, while also hitting 20 triples and compiling 367 total bases. He also placed second in an unofficial vote in 1929--the American League had dropped the award that year, and the National League would drop it the following year. It was the same voters and structure as before however. He also finished third in the MVP voting in 1932 and 1933 and was the leading batter on the 1933 Washington Senators team that won the American League pennant and lost the 1933 World Series to the New York Giants.

Manush compiled 7 five-hit games and 52 four-hit games in his 17-year major league career.

Manush was also a solid defensive outfielder, appearing in 2,008 major league games, 1,381 as a left fielder, 312 as a center fielder, and 153 as a right fielder. He led the American League with 356 putouts and a .992 fielding percentage in left field in 1928, and five double plays turned by a left fielder in 1935. His 2,855 putouts in left field rank 21st in major league history.

==Early years==
Manush was born in 1901 at Tuscumbia, Alabama, a city in the Florence–Mussel Shoals metropolitan area that is best known as the hometown of Helen Keller. His father, George Manush, immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1878 and worked as a cabinet maker and carpenter for a railroad company. His mother, Kate Manush, was born in Wisconsin, the daughter of German immigrants.

Manush was nicknamed &quot;Heinie&quot; due to his German ancestry. He was one of eight children in the family, seven boys and one girl. All seven boys took up baseball, five of them playing the game professionally. His brother Frank Manush was 18 years older than Heinie and played professional baseball from 1907 to 1921. Manush was seven years old when Frank made his major league debut in 1908 and later recalled: &quot;When I was as young as 7 or 8, Frank used to bring home all his baseball equipment and uniform. I would look at that weird paraphernalia and wish I could wear it. From then on, baseball was all I ever had on my mind.&quot;

Manush started high school in Tuscumbia but transferred as a senior to Massey Military Academy, located 80 miles northeast of Tuscumbia in Cornersville, Tennessee. In 1918, Manush moved to Iowa to join another brother in the plumbing business. He then moved to California in March 1919 and played semipro baseball with a club in Los Angeles.

==Professional baseball==

===Minor leagues===
Manush began his professional career in 1920, playing six games for the Portland Beavers in the Pacific Coast League. Moving to the Edmonton Eskimos in the Western Canada League in 1921, Manush hit .321 in 83 games. In 1922, he played for the Omaha Buffaloes in the Western League, hitting 20 home runs and compiling a .376 batting average that was second in the league behind only Carl East.

===Detroit Tigers===

After Manush&#x27;s 1922 performance in Omaha, he was purchased by the Detroit Tigers. In early February 1923, Manush returned a signed contract with the Tigers, joining a star-studded Detroit outfield that included future Hall of Famers Harry Heilmann and Ty Cobb, as well as reliable sluggers Bobby Veach (.327 batting average in 1922), Bob Fothergill (.322 average in 1922), and Ira Flagstead (.308 average in 1922). During his rookie season with the Tigers, Manush played well enough to appear in 109 games, 79 as a left fielder, sharing the position with Veach. He compiled a .334 batting average, tenth highest in the American League. He also led the league with 17 times hit by pitch.

In 1924, Manush appeared in 120 games, 71 as the starting left fielder, and his batting average dropped 45 points to .289, though he again led the league with 16 times hit by pitch. Ty Cobb later accepted responsibility for Manush&#x27;s slump in 1924. Cobb believed that, by studying the &quot;science&quot; of hitting, every batter could improve. Accordingly, he took Manush aside for several days early in the 1924 season to work on improving Manush&#x27;s technique and batting stance. After working with Cobb, Manush&#x27;s batting average and self-confidence plummeted. Cobb eventually came to the conclusion that, like Babe Ruth, Manush was a &quot;natural&quot; hitter rather than a &quot;scientific&quot; one and that it was a mistake to try to change a natural hitter.

In 1925, Manush moved to center field as a backup to Cobb. He appeared in 99 games, including 45 as the team&#x27;s starting center fielder and 12 as the starting left fielder, and compiled a .302 batting average.

In 1926, Manush took over from Ty Cobb as the Tigers&#x27; starting center fielder, a position held by Cobb for 20 years. Manush had the best season of his career up to then, compiling a .378 batting average to win the American League batting title. He also ranked among the league&#x27;s leaders with a .986 on-base plus slugging rating (second behind Babe Ruth) and a .564 slugging percentage (third behind Ruth and Al Simmons).

Manush trailed Babe Ruth for the batting championship going into the last day of the 1926 season. On the final day, September 26, the Tigers played a doubleheader, and Manush overtook Ruth by garnering six hits in nine at bats. By taking the batting crown, Manush also denied Ruth the Triple Crown. In a 1964 interview, Manush cited his beating Ruth on the last day of the 1926 season as one of two events in his career (the other was playing in the 1933 World Series) that most stood out for him.

Manush&#x27;s improvement in 1926 was credited to the mentoring of teammate Harry Heilmann, who won American League batting crowns in 1921, 1923, 1925 and 1927. After Manush slumped in 1925, Heilmann, who had a talent for placing his hits, &quot;took Manush in tow and taught him some tricks.&quot; After Heilmann&#x27;s lessons, Manush developed a talent for dropping hits over second base between the left and center fielders.

In 1927, Manush continued as the Tigers&#x27; starting center fielder, appearing in 146 games at the position, but his batting average dropped by 80 points from .378 to .298. He did still rank among the American League leaders, however, with 18 triples (second), 101 runs scored (seventh), 177 hits (tenth), 55 extra base hits (tenth), and 262 total bases (tenth). He also rated among the league&#x27;s leading center fielders with a .971 fielding percentage (second) and 356 putouts (third).

===St. Louis Browns===
On December 13, 1927, the Tigers traded Manush and first baseman Lu Blue to the St. Louis Browns in exchange for outfielder Harry Rice, pitcher Elam Vangilder, and a player to be named later. The trade was promptly criticized as being one-sided in favor of St. Louis, and proved as much when Manush had an outstanding 1928 season for the Browns.

Manush appeared in all 154 games as the Browns&#x27; starting left fielder in 1928 and compiled a .378 batting average, narrowly missing a second batting title to Goose Goslin who hit .379, one point higher than Manush. The battle for the batting title was the closest in 18 years, and Manush, who appeared in 19 more games than Goslin, led the league with 241 hits, 68 more than Goslin. Manush also led the American League in 1928 with 47 doubles and finished among the league leaders with 367 total bases (second behind Babe Ruth), 20 triples (second), a 6.8 offensive wins above replacement rating (third behind Ruth and Lou Gehrig), 80 extra base hits (third behind Ruth and Gehrig), a .575 slugging percentage (fourth), and 108 RBIs (fourth). He helped the Browns improve by 23 wins from a 59-94 record in 1927 to an 82-72 record in 1928. He also finished second behind Mickey Cochrane in close voting for the 1928 American League Most Valuable Player award, with Cochrane garnering 53 vote points to 51 for Manush.

Manush had another fine season in 1929, appearing in 145 games in left field for the Browns, while compiling the third-highest batting average (.355) in the American League. He was once again second in the AL MVP vote, losing to Lew Fonseca. He also finished in a three-way tie for the league lead with 45 doubles and ranked fifth in the league with 204 hits.

Manush was a holdout in 1930, refusing to report unless his salary was substantially increased. He finally signed a contract and reported to the club on March 20, 1930. Manush appeared in 48 games as the Browns&#x27; starting left fielder and compiled a .328 batting average.

===Washington Senators===
On June 13, 1930, the Browns traded Manush with pitcher Alvin Crowder to the Washington Senators in exchange for left fielder Goose Goslin, with whom Manush had battled for the 1928 batting title. It was reported at the time of the trade that the team owners were trying to rid themselves of players who held out, Manush and Goslin both having been holdouts at the start of the 1930 season. In the second half of the 1930 season, Manush took over Goslin&#x27;s spot as Washington&#x27;s left fielder, starting 86 games at the position and batting .362. In 1931, Manush started 146 games in left field and compiled a .307 batting average.

In 1932, Manush had one of the best seasons of his career. Continuing as the Senators&#x27; left fielder, he compiled a .342 batting average, fourth highest in the American League, and finished third in American League MVP voting behind Jimmie Foxx and Lou Gehrig. He also ranked among the league&#x27;s leaders with 214 hits (second), 121 runs scored (third), 324 total bases (fifth), 14 triples (fifth), a .520 slugging percentage (sixth), and 116 RBIs (sixth).

Manush had another strong season in 1933. Appearing in 150 games in left field, he compiled the second highest batting average (.336) in the American League, trailing only Jimmie Foxx. He led the American League with 221 hits and 17 triples and ranked third in the league with 115 runs scored and 302 total bases. He also had a pair of long hitting streaks, first a 26 gamer one then a 33-game hitting streak in 1933 and finished third in the American League MVP voting. He helped lead the 1933 Washington Senators to the American League pennant with a 99-53 record.

The Senators lost the 1933 World Series to the New York Giants, four games to one. Manush had only two hits and two walks, though he also scored two runs, in 20 plate appearances during the 1933 World Series. In Game 4, Manush was ejected by umpire Charlie Moran after arguing Moran&#x27;s calling Manush out on a close play at first base. The Senators lost the game in the 11th inning, and the ejection of Manush was bitterly denounced by the Senators after the loss. After the game, baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis opined that Manush should not have been ejected and ruled that Manush would be permitted to play the next day. Manush confessed 31 years later to his actual conduct on that day. He recalled beating out the throw at first, which would have been a turning point in the game with Goose Goslin already on second base. Manush was so angry at the call that he had pulled on Moran&#x27;s rubber bow tie:

I didn&#x27;t lay a hand on Moran, but I did grab that bow tie and pulled it two feet away from his neck and then I let it snap right back into his gullet. ... Even before he could recover his breath his thumb went up and I was out.

In 1934, Manush appeared in 137 games, 129 as the starting left fielder. He began the season on a torrid pace, batting .411 with 111 hits, 24 doubles and 10 triples by June 25. He was selected to play in the 1934 Major League Baseball All-Star Game held on July 10, the second ever All-Star Game. In the first inning, Manush was walked by Carl Hubbell and executed a double steal with Charlie Gehringer.

Manush slumped in the second half of the 1934 season, recording only 83 hits after June 25, but he still ranked among the league leaders for the 1934 season with a .349 batting average (third), 11 triples (second), 292 putouts in left field (second), a .980 fielding percentage in left field (second), and a 2.28 range factor per game in left field (second).

The slump that struck Manush in the last half of the 1934 season continued through the 1935 season. His batting average plummeted to .273, 76 points lower than his 1934 average, and he started only 109 games, fewer than in any season since 1925. Despite limited playing time, he led the American League&#x27;s left fielders with five double plays turned in 1935. Manush was hitting .297 on August 23rd, then went through a 2-45 slump, was benched for the rest of the season, effectively ending his tenure in DC.

===Boston, Brooklyn and Pittsburgh===
On December 17, 1935, the Senators traded Manush to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for Roy Johnson and Carl Reynolds. At the time of the trade, some expressed hope that a change of scenery, and a reunion with manager Joe Cronin who had managed the Senators during Manush&#x27;s best seasons, would help Manush return to his old form. Instead, the slump followed Manush to Boston, as he appeared in only 82 games, 72 as a starter, and compiled a .291 batting average. He was given an outright release by the Red Sox on September 27, 1936.

On December 9, 1936, Manush signed as a free agent with the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Dodgers had been seeking a young outfielder, and &quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; reacted with surprise to the signing of Manush, its headline reading, &quot;Dodgers Search for Youth Unearths Manush, Aged 36&quot;. In spring training with the Dodgers, Manush broke out of his batting slump, leading the Florida circuit with a .571 average by late March. He became the Dodgers&#x27; starting right fielder in 1937, and in his first season facing National League pitching, Manush compiled a .333 batting average, ninth highest in the league.

Manush began the 1938 season with the Dodgers, but his batting slump returned as his average fell to .238 in 17 games. He was released by the Dodgers on May 15, 1938. A week after being released by the Dodgers, Manush signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. He appeared in 81 games for Toronto and compiled a .310 batting average in 277 at bats.

On August 30, 1938, the Pittsburgh Pirates purchased Manush from Toronto as an &quot;insurance outfielder and pinch hitter&quot; for the last month of the pennant drive with the Chicago Cubs. Manush appeared as a pinch hitter in 15 games for the 1938 Pirates, batting .308 in 13 at bats. Manush returned to the Pirates in 1939, but played sparingly with no hits in 12 at bats. He appeared in his final major league game on May 22, 1939, at age 37, and was released by the Pirates on June 7, 1939.

===Minor league player and manager===
On June 12, 1939, Manush signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs, with whom he played for most of the 1938 season. He appeared in 66 games for Toronto and compiled a batting average of only .241. Manush spent the next five years as a player-manager in the Piedmont League for the Rocky Mount Red Sox in 1940, the Greensboro Red Sox in 1941 and 1942, the Roanoke Red Sox in 1943. In 1944, he served as manager of the Scranton Miners in the Eastern League, and in 1945 he became manager of the Martinsville A&#x27;s in the Carolina League.

Manush scouted for the Boston Braves until 1948, then served as a coach for the Senators during the 1953 and 1954 seasons. In October 1954, after Chuck Dressen was hired as the Senators&#x27; new manager, he was replaced. He later scouted for the expansion Washington Senators in 1961–62.

===Hall of Fame and legacy===
In 17 seasons as a player in the major leagues, Manush appeared in 2,008 games, 1,381 as a left fielder, 312 as a center fielder, and 153 as a right fielder, and compiled a .330 batting average with 2,524 hits, 1,288 runs scored, and 1,183 RBIs. His notable career accomplishments include the following:
* His .330 career batting average ranks 33rd in major league history. His .378 average in 1926 was the highest in Major League Baseball that year, six points higher than Babe Ruth, thus depriving Ruth of the Triple Crown. 
* His 241 hits in 1928, a 154-game season, was the fifth highest single-season total to that point in major league history. It still ranks as the 11th highest single-season total.
* His 2,855 career putouts in left field rank 21st in major league history. His 1928 total of 356 putouts in left field was the ninth highest single-season total in major league history at the time. He also held the career high fielding pct for a Left Fielder when he retired in &#x27;39, .980.
* His 33 career double plays turned in left field rank 25th in major league history.

In February 1964, Manush was elected by the Veterans Committee to the Baseball Hall of Fame. On learning the news, Manush, at his home in Sarasota, Florida, told reporters, &quot;It&#x27;s quite a shock to me to be picked ... I feel wonderful ... I had no idea this would ever happen to me.&quot;

The 1942 motion picture &quot;Obliging Young Lady&quot; opens with a comedic sequence in which Edmond O&#x27;Brien keeps repeating &quot;Heinie Manush, Heinie Manush&quot; in cadence with the sound of the train on which he is riding. At one point, a porter interrupts, &quot;Who is Heinie Manush?&quot;, and O&#x27;Brien replies, &quot;The great baseball player.&quot; In the dining car, O&#x27;Brien continues even as he orders, &quot;Filet mignon that&#x27;s for me, filet mignon that&#x27;s for me, Heinie Manush, Heinie Manush, Heinie Manush, Heinie Manush, filet mignon, medium rare, Heinie Manush, Heinie Manush.&quot; The repetitive, onomatopoeic nature of the phrase fit the sound of the train so well that other riders began to pick it up, driving the conductor to distraction.

Manush was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1964, and later posthumously into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1972.

==Family and later years==
Manush was married, and he and his wife Betty had three daughters, Shirley who died at age 58 in 1987, Lillis, who also died in 1987 at age 56 and Sue McCaw, who lived in Florida and turned 76 in 2009. She passed on in 2010. They lived in Sarasota, Florida, beginning in 1935. His wife died in June 1949 at age 46 after undergoing an operation at Harper Hospital in Detroit.
Manush picked up the game of golf in 1935 and he won multiple city golf championships in Sarasota.

Manush fought an extended battle against throat cancer, was placed in a Sarasota nursing home on March 11, 1971, and died there on May 12, 1971. He was interred next to his wife Betty at Sarasota Memorial Park.

<doc id="516967" wikidata="Q7797613" url="?curid=516967" title="Three man">
<text>Three man (also referred to as Mr. Three, hat man or the trifecta) is a drinking game played with two dice. It can be played with at least three people but some consider it better with around five.

==Rules==

A random player is chosen to be the &quot;three man&quot;, and may be given a hat to wear to signify this role. Players then take turns around the table to roll two six-sided dice, with one version of the rules stating the following effects:

;Threes
:For a roll that totals 3, or shows 3 on one of its dice, the three man must take a drink.
;Sevens
:For any roll that totals 7, the person to the left of roller drinks. (If a 3-4 is rolled, &quot;three man&quot; must also drink.)
;Tens
:Any roll that totals 10 is called a &quot;social&quot;: all players drink.
;Elevens
:For any roll that totals 11, the person to the right of roller drinks.
;Doubles
:Whenever a double is rolled, the roller may pass the dice to one or two other players, who roll the dice and apply the result. If this results in another double, the original roller must drink the sum of the dice.

If a roll meets none of these criteria, the player&#x27;s turn is over.

The role of the three man may change during the game. Some versions of the game allow the three man to pass their role on after taking a drink under the &quot;threes&quot; rule, others have the three man lose their role upon rolling &quot;threes&quot; themselves, with the next person to roll &quot;threes&quot; becoming the new three man.

==Variations==
In the &quot;doubles&quot; variation, whoever rolls doubles (Player A) can &quot;give&quot; them to another player (Player B), who then rolls both the dice to see how many times they must drink. If B rolls doubles, the dice are returned to A, who must roll and drink twice as many times as the value that they roll (e.g., if A rolls 3 and 2, A must drink 10 times).

In the &quot;party foul&quot; variant, if the dice fall off the table, the player drinks for each fallen die. When a &quot;sloppy jalopy&quot; rule is applied, the player with fallen dice is loudly admonished as a &quot;sloppy jalopy&quot; and immediately becomes the new three man.

One version includes special effects for any roll of 1:
* 1 and 1 follow the usual rules for passing off doubles. 
* 1 and 2 makes the roller the three man. 
* 1 and 3 makes the three man drink (as with any roll of a 3). 
* 1 and 4 thumb to table or floor: last player to place his/her thumb must drink. 
* 1 and 5 turn ends. 
* When a 1 and 6 is rolled, the player to the left drinks. 

Another house rule is a &quot;bathroom penalty&quot;: if a player is in the bathroom when it is their turn to roll, they must take a drink for every 5 seconds they are late in returning.

In an Australian version of this game the rules are as follows:

*1+1: New Rule (You make a rule affecting the current game, little green man,[5] Nicknames etc)
*1+2: 3 man (You are the three man; put on a hat, every time a three is on the dice drink, remains until someone else rolls this)
*2-2 3-3 4-4 5-5 6-6 (doubles): Choose a person to fill their drink and finish their drink.
*7 or 11: Choose a person to fill their drink and finish their drink. If someone has a double, seven or eleven they roll as soon as the person touches the cup and if they get a 7, 11, or double the person must repeat. If a player touches the dice before that, they must finish their drink. On the third time this is rolled, the roller must finish their drink.
*9: Busta Rhyme (Make up one line of a rhyme, go around table, loser drinks)
*10: Categories (Select a category, go around the table until someone misses out they drink)

Other rules require the roller to drink on an 11, or the player to the right to drink on a 9. One variant says that on rolling a five, the player must high-five the three man.

<text>Perry Scott Walker (October 30, 1969 – January 31, 2004) was an American professional boxer.

Walker&#x27;s nickname was &quot;The Pink Cat&quot;, and he gained some attention in the 1990s boxing scene for wearing pink boxing trunks and slicked-back hair, the latter a tribute to his idol, James Dean. He is best known for winning a ten-round decision over hall-of-fame champion Alexis Argüello, ending Arguello&#x27;s ill-conceived bid at a comeback in January 1995. Six months after this victory, Walker won the WBC Continental Americas super lightweight title over Francisco Cuesta on July 17, 1995. This victory led to negotiations for a title shot against another hall-of-famer, Julio César Chávez. Early in January 1996, Bob Arum&#x27;s Top Rank Boxing offered Walker $55,000 to fight for Chavez&#x27;s WBC junior welterweight title. This fight was considered a tune-up for Chavez&#x27;s June 1996 bout against Oscar De La Hoya. Apparently, Chavez didn&#x27;t want to risk the possibility that Walker could derail his plans for the de la Hoya fight, so Arum switched the Chavez-Walker fight to a non-title, ten-round event. The fight, nationally televised, took place on February 9, 1996, at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. Walker won the first round on two of the three judges&#x27; scorecards, but he got caught with a Chavez right hand half-way through the second round, after which he took a pummeling that referee Joe Cortez stopped at the 2:45 mark of the round, resulting in a knockout loss for Walker. This marked the first time (of only two times) that Walker was knocked out. Walker was paid $62,500 for his effort; Top Rank added $7,500 for withdrawing the title opportunity.

He retired with a record of 25–7–1 (13 KO&#x27;s). His last fight was a decision loss against Martin Ramirez in January 2001.

In addition to his boxing career, Walker was a guitarist, singer and songwriter, and fronted The Pink Cat Band. They released a six-song CD called &quot;Bounty Hunter&quot;.

Walker was found dead in his home of unspecified causes. He is a member of the Arizona Boxing Hall of Fame.

<text>Yeongdong (, , literally &#x27;east of the passes&#x27;) is the eastern, coastal region of Gangwon Province, South Korea and Kangwŏn Province, North Korea. It is divided from the inland Yeongseo region by the Taebaek Mountains.

Although Yeongseo describes the western half of the two provinces and Gwandong describes both halves together, &quot;Yeongdong&quot; is used much more frequently in South Korea than either of the other two names, and may be taken loosely to refer to the entire region.

The region&#x27;s name lends itself to the Yeongdong Railway Line and Yeongdong Expressway, which are major transportation corridors connecting Seoul to Gangwon.

<doc id="516989" wikidata="Q1053326" url="?curid=516989" title="NexGen">
<text>NexGen, Inc. was a private semiconductor company based in Milpitas, California, that designed x86 microprocessors until it was purchased by AMD on January 16, 1996. NexGen was a fabless design house that designed its chips but relied on other companies for production. NexGen&#x27;s chips were produced by IBM&#x27;s Microelectronics division in Burlington, Vermont alongside PowerPC and DRAM parts.

The company was best known for the unique implementation of the x86 architecture in its processors. NexGen&#x27;s CPUs were designed very differently from other processors based on the x86 instruction set at the time: the processor would translate code designed to run on the traditionally CISC-based x86 architecture to run on the chip&#x27;s internal RISC architecture. The architecture was used in later AMD chips such as the K6, and to an extent most x86 processors today implement a &quot;hybrid&quot; architecture similar to those used in NexGen&#x27;s processors.

It went public in 1994, and was bought by AMD in 1995 for $850M. The technology forms the platform architecture for all of AMD&#x27;s current microprocessors. It was an unusual start-up in its time as the original funding came from corporate investors, Compaq and Olivetti, joined in a later round by venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1986 by Thampy Thomas, being funded by Compaq, ASCII and Kleiner Perkins. Its first design was targeted at the 80386 generation of processors. But the design was so large and complicated it could only be implemented using eight chips instead of one and by the time it was ready, the industry had moved onto the 80486 generation.

Its second design, the Nx586 CPU, was introduced in 1994, was the first CPU to attempt to compete directly against Intel&#x27;s Pentium, with its Nx586-P80 and Nx586-P90 CPUs. Unlike competing chips from AMD and Cyrix, the Nx586 was not pin-compatible with the Pentium or any other Intel chip and required its own custom NxVL-based motherboard and chipset. NexGen offered both a VLB and a PCI motherboard for the Nx586 chips.

Like the later Pentium-class CPUs from AMD and Cyrix, clock for clock it was more efficient than the Pentium, so the P80 ran at 75 MHz and the P90 ran at 83.3 MHz. Unfortunately for NexGen, it measured its performance relative to a Pentium using an early chipset; improvements included in Intel&#x27;s first Triton chipset increased the Pentium&#x27;s performance relative to the Nx586 and NexGen had difficulty keeping up. Furthermore, PCs identified the Nx586 as an 80386 processor; as a result many applications that require a processor faster than a 386 will not work unless CPU identification software is active. Unlike the Pentium, the Nx586 had no built-in math coprocessor; an optional Nx587 provided this functionality.

In later Nx586s, an x87 math coprocessor was included on-chip. Using IBM&#x27;s multichip module (MCM) technology, NexGen combined the 586 and 587 die in a single package. The new device, which used the same pinout as its predecessor, was marketed as the Nx586-PF100 to distinguish it from the FPU-less Nx586-P100.
Compaq, which had backed the company financially, announced its intention to use the Nx586 and even struck the name &quot;Pentium&quot; from its product literature, demos, and boxes, substituting the &quot;586&quot; moniker, but never used NexGen&#x27;s chip widely. Instead, Alaris, Inc., a smaller computer systems maker, became the first company to ship a computer with the Nx586 in fall 1994.

AMD purchased NexGen when AMD&#x27;s K5 chip failed to meet performance and sales expectations. Some NexGen customers were even given free AMD K5 CPUs with motherboards in exchange for sending in their NexGen hardware. 

Development of AMD&#x27;s internal K5 successor was halted in favor of continuing from NexGen&#x27;s Nx686 designs, eventually becoming K6.

<doc id="516994" wikidata="Q6841695" url="?curid=516994" title="Middle reliever">
<text>In baseball, a middle reliever, or middle relief pitcher, is a relief pitcher who typically pitches during the fifth, sixth, and seventh innings of a standard baseball game. In leagues with no designated hitter, such as in the National League before 2022 and the Japanese Central League, a middle reliever often comes in after the starting pitcher has been pulled in favor of a pinch hitter. Middle-relief pitchers are usually tasked to pitch one, two, or three innings. Several factors determine this, such as who’s winning, the score, eligible bullpen pitchers remaining, the importance of the current game, etc. After the middle relief pitcher has completed his portion, they are normally replaced in later innings by a left/right-handed specialist, setup pitcher, and/or lastly a closer. When they’re replaced, it is partly due to deprivation of stamina and/or effectiveness but also characteristics, such as pitch arsenal, speed of pitches, which arm they throw with, and who’s up to bat next for the opposing team. Middle relievers may pitch in these later innings, especially during games tied or close in score.

<doc id="516995" wikidata="Q182942" url="?curid=516995" title="Cuando River">
<text>The Cuando River (or Kwando in the non-colonial spelling) is a river in south-central Africa flowing through Angola and Namibia&#x27;s Caprivi Strip and into the Linyanti Swamp on the northern border of Botswana. Below the swamp, the river is called the Linyanti River and, farther east, the Chobe River, before it flows into the Zambezi River.

==Course==



The Cuando rises in the central plateau of Angola on the slopes of Mount Tembo, thence flowing southeast along the Zambian border. Along this reach it flows in a maze of channels in a swampy corridor 5–10 km wide (map 1: the border with Zambia is the eastern bank of this floodplain, not the river channel). As with all rivers in south-central Africa, its flow varies enormously between the rainy season when it floods and may be several kilometres wide, and the dry season when it may disappear into marshes.

The Cuando continues in its marshy channel across the neck of the Caprivi Strip of Namibia (map, 2) and then forms the border between Namibia and Botswana as it continues southeast. Some 10,000 years ago, the Cuando merged with the Okavango River and they flowed south to Lake Makgadikgadi (which is a seasonal wetland in current times), but the land in that area was uplifted. As a consequence the Cuando now meets slightly higher ground (map, 4) and breaks up into many channels and swamps (called the Linyanti Swamp) dotted with alluvial islands, nearly disappearing into the Kalahari sands like the Okavango (map, 5). But instead it has diverted east and has been captured by the Zambezi. The flow turns sharply east, still forming the border with Botswana. In the dry season there are few open channels through the swamps and marshes. Beginning at this point it is known as the Linyanti (map, 6), and after it flows through a seasonal lake, Lake Liambesi (map, 7), it is called the Chobe (map, 8). The river then flows into the Zambezi just above the former Kazungula Ferry (map, 9), now replaced by the Kazungula Bridge.

In years when the Okavango experiences a good flood some of the water escapes east along the normally dry channel of the Magwekwana River (also known as Selinda Spillway) into the Linyanti Swamp, thus entering the Zambezi basin. The Selinda Spillway and the Boteti River are the only outlets of the Okavango basin.

On the north side of the Chobe River are the Caprivi Swamps, on the edge of which is the ruined capital of the Kololo people who conquered Barotseland in the 19th century.

So much of the water of the Cuando, Linyanti and Chobe is lost to evaporation in the various swamps that its contribution to the flow of the Zambezi is very small except in occasional years when it floods excessively.

The perennial river bifurcation of Selinda Spillway (or Magweggana River), on the Cuando River, connects the Kalahari Basin to the Zambezi Basin.

==Wildlife==
The Cuando system is noted for its wildlife and for most of its length the land either side is protected as game reserves or wildlife management areas. Some of these suffered poaching during wars and conflict in Namibia and Angola, but with peace restored in those countries they have the chance of returning to their former state.

The national parks through which it passes or on which it borders are:
*Coutada Publica do Luiana (Angola)
*Sioma Ngwezi National Park (Zambia)
*Bwabwata National Park (Namibia)
*Mudumu National Park (Namibia)
*Nkasa Rupara National Park (Namibia)
*Chobe National Park (Botswana)

<text>Dog Kung Fu, i.e. Gǒuquán (), i.e. Dìshùquán (), is a martial arts style native to Fujian province China. While sharing many similar features to styles like Wuzuquan, Huzunquan, and many others from the same region, this southern style of Chinese boxing has the unique feature of specializing in takedowns, Chin Na, and ground fighting while often taking advantage of utilizing techniques from an inferior position. This martial art also teaches Iron Shirt and Iron Palm fighting methods as well as specialized leaping techniques. Its creation is traditionally credited to a Buddhist nun who developed the style to defend herself from bandits on her travels.

==Origins==
One of the legends on the origins of Dog Kung Fu says that in the southern area of China in Fujian Province, resided the White Lotus () temple, where often the nuns who were admitted previously lived secular lives. At that time women were often subjugated to the practice of foot binding. Therefore, any practice that required standing physical exertion was difficult in the least and practically impossible at worst. In response to these physical constraints, the nuns developed a system of fighting that they could use to defend themselves from bandits and wild animals. During the Qing Dynasty imperial regime&#x27;s destruction of the temples, a nun by the name of Si Yue had left White Lotus Temple and traveled to the northern areas of the province. Supposedly she had fallen ill in the Yongtai region near Fuzhou, it was there that she was assisted by the Chen Family who took care of her until recovery. As she was indebted to the Chen Family she remained and taught their son, Chen Biao, Gouquan. The Chen family kept this art a family secret for several generations.

Another legend suggests that the famous Fong Sai-Yuk was a master of Dishuquan and had passed his skills to monks in the Zhuyuansi Temple (nowadays known as Guanyuan Temple), this was passed through various generations until a monk named Hui Kai taught the style to Zheng Yishan.

<text>Georges-Émile Lapalme (January 14, 1907 – February 5, 1985) was a Quebec, Canada, politician who was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec and leader of the Quebec Liberal Party.

==Background==
Born in Montreal Lapalme studied law at the Université de Montréal. He was married to Maria Langlois for nearly 50 years with whom he had seven children.

==Member of Parliament==
Lapalme was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1945 federal election for the Liberal Party of Canada and served until 1950.

==Provincial politics==
He resigned his federal seat to be acclaimed leader of the Liberal Party of Quebec in 1950. He ran for a seat to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in the district of Joliette in the 1952 election but was defeated by the Labour Minister, the Union Nationale candidate Antonio Barrette.

Lapalme won a by-election in the district of Montréal-Outremont in 1953. He was re-elected in the 1956 election, but under his leadership, his party lost the election against the Union Nationale. He remained a Liberal leader until 1958 and remained Leader of the Opposition in Quebec until 1960.

<doc id="517000" wikidata="Q6673520" url="?curid=517000" title="Long reliever">
<text>A long reliever or long-relief pitcher is a relief pitcher in baseball who enters the game if the starting pitcher leaves the game early.

Long relievers often enter in the first three innings of a game when the starting pitcher cannot continue, whether due to ineffective pitching, lack of endurance, rain delays, injury, or ejection. The hope is that the long reliever will be able to get the game under control, and his team&#x27;s offense will be able to help get the team back into the game. The hope is also that the long reliever will pitch long enough to save other relievers in the bullpen from having to pitch. 

Long relievers are usually players who used to be starters either in the major leagues or in the minors (and still can be a temporary starter if one of the normal starters is injured or otherwise unavailable, or necessary due to workload as a &quot;spot starter&quot;), but whose teams believe they have better starters available. Sometimes a team&#x27;s long reliever is a former starter who has lost his effectiveness, either through a decline in skills or a series of injuries. Occasionally, long relievers are inexperienced pitchers who may have the potential to become starters or setup pitchers after gaining major league experience.

The quality of long relievers can vary, but when the long reliever is considered to be an ineffective former starter, he is often called the &quot;mop up man&quot; or &quot;mop-up pitcher&quot; and is often called by managers to pitch in games where there is a abundant run margin between either team which is colloquially termed pitching &quot;mop duty&quot;.

A secondary use of a long reliever is in the late extra innings of a tied game, once the team&#x27;s other, generally more effective, relievers have already been used. While a long reliever is often a team&#x27;s least effective pitcher, he is still often a far better choice in an extended game than resorting to one of the team&#x27;s starting pitchers (which can spread chaos throughout a pitching rotation, as everyone&#x27;s future schedule gets adjusted), or even worse, resorting to a position player on the mound. A long man generally enters the game somewhere between the 11th and 16th innings in this role, and can be expected to pitch 5 or more innings, before a team will be forced to resort to other options. 

Occasionally during the season, a team may find itself with enough rest days to allow it to use a four-man rotation rather than the now standard five. In these situations, a team may choose to keep their &quot;fifth&quot; starter on the roster in the long reliever role. This happens particularly in the post-season, when the fifth starter is a better pitcher than the &quot;regular&quot; long-reliever, allowing the team to carry either an additional short reliever, or position player, in lieu of the regular long man.

In recent years, teams began experimenting with an &quot;opener&quot;, a relief pitcher who starts a game but only pitches for at least the first inning. In this strategy, the opener usually pitches against the opponent&#x27;s best batters at the start of a game in hopes of throwing them off guard, before giving way to a long reliever who would normally be a starter in this situation.

<text>Otto Wilhelm Fischer (, ; 1 April 1915 – 29 January 2004) was an Austrian film and theatre actor, a leading man of West German cinema during the &quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot; era of the 1950s and 1960s.

==Biography==
He was born in Klosterneuburg near Vienna, where he obtained his &quot;Matura&quot; degree at the local gymnasium secondary school. Fischer began studying English and German philology and art history at the University of Vienna, in 1936, however, he enlisted at the Max Reinhardt Seminar drama school. He had first engagements as an actor at the Vienna Theater in der Josefstadt, the Munich Kammerspiele, and the Vienna Volkstheater. In 1945 he reached the highpoint of his theatre career when he joined the ensemble of the Burgtheater.

Fischer began filming in 1936, his performance in the 1942 propaganda movie &quot;Vienna 1910&quot; earned him an entry on Goebbel&#x27;s &quot;Gottbegnadeten list&quot;. He made his breakthrough after the war starring in &quot;A Heidelberg Romance&quot; and numerous other romance films, often with female co-stars Maria Schell and Ruth Leuwerik.

Fischer enjoyed a great career, but unlike countrymen and -women Oskar Werner, Curd Jürgens, Maria Schell and Romy Schneider, he never made it internationally. Worse, his American break ended before it began: he was signed to star with June Allyson in a remake of &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; in 1956, but was fired after 16 days of shooting and replaced by David Niven when Fischer reportedly lost his memory during filming. Fischer directed and starred opposite Anouk Aimée in a 1956 film, &quot;Ich suche Dich&quot;, based on the play, &quot;Jupiter Laughs&quot;, by A. J. Cronin. In 1955, he directed and starred in &quot;Hanussen&quot;, a movie detailing the life of clairvoyant Erik Jan Hanussen. While the film is considered highly romanticized, it assisted historians and biographers in uncovering previously unknown facts. He also starred in the title role of tragic King Ludwig II of Bavaria in the classic German film, &quot;Ludwig II: Glanz und Ende eines Königs&quot; by Helmut Käutner.

In 2021 Senta Berger claimed that O. W. Fischer attempted to rape her in a hotel room during production on &quot;Es muß nicht immer Kaviar sein&quot; (1961)

In the early 1970s, he retired to live in Vernate, Ticino and to concentrate on linguistics and philosophy, on which he lectured and published a number of books. He died in Lugano, Switzerland of kidney failure.

<text>The Cunene (Portuguese spelling) or Kunene (common Namibian spelling) is a river in Southern Africa. It flows from the Angola highlands southwards to the border with Namibia. It then flows in a westerly direction along the border until it reaches the Atlantic Ocean.

== Geography ==
One of the few perennial rivers in the region, the Cunene is about long, with a drainage basin in area. Its mean annual discharge is to at its mouth.
The Epupa Falls lie on the river. Olushandja Dam dams a tributary of the river, the Etaka, and helps to provide the Ruacana Power Station with water.

The main stream rises in 12° 30′ S. and about 160 miles in a direct line from the sea at Benguella, runs generally from north to south through four degrees of latitude, but finally flows west to the sea through a break in the outer highlands.

Between the mouths of its two tributaries, the Cunene traverses a swampy plain, inundated during high water, and containing several small lakes at other times of the year. From this swampy region divergent branches run S.E. They are mainly intermittent, but the Kwamatuo, which leaves the main stream in about 15° 8′ E., 17° 15′ S., flows into a large marsh or lake called Etosha, which occupies a depression in the inner table-land about 3400 ft. above sea-level. From the S.E. end of the Etosha lake streams issue in the direction of the Okavango, to which in times of great flood they contribute some water.

On leaving the swampy region the Cunene turns decidedly to the west, and descends to the coast plain by a number of cataracts, of which the chief (in 17° 25′ S., 14° 20′ E.) has a fall of 330 ft. The river becomes smaller in volume as it passes through an almost desert region with little or no vegetation. The stream is sometimes shallow and fordable, at others confined to a narrow rocky channel. Near the sea the Cunene traverses a region of sand-hills, its mouth being completely blocked at low water. The river enters the Atlantic in 17° 18′ S., 11° 40′ E. There are indications that a former branch of the river once entered a bay to the south.

== Dam controversies ==
The Namibian government proposed in the late 1990s to build the Epupa Dam, a controversial hydroelectric dam on the Cunene. In 2012 the Governments of Namibia and Angola announced plans to jointly build the Orokawe dam in the Baynes Mountains. According to the indigenous Himba who would have been most affected by the construction of the dam, the dam would threaten the local ecosystem and therefore the economic basis of the Himba. During February 2012, traditional Himba chiefs issued a declaration to the African Union and to the United Nations Human Rights Council of the United Nations, titled &quot;Declaration of the most affected Ovahimba, Ovatwa, Ovatjimba and Ovazemba against the Orokawe Dam in the Baynes Mountains,&quot; which outlines the fierce objections against the dam from the traditional Himba chiefs and communities that reside near the Kunene River.

In September 2012, the United Nations special rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples visited the Himba, and heard their concerns.

On November 23, 2012, hundreds of Himba and Zemba from Omuhonga and Epupa region protested in Okanguati against Namibia&#x27;s plans to construct a dam in the Kunene River in the Baynes Mountains, against increasing mining operations on their traditional land and human rights violations against them.

On March 25, 2013, over a thousand Himba and Zemba people marched in Opuwo to protest once more against Namibia&#x27;s plans to build the Orokawe dam in the Cunene River without consulting with the indigenous peoples that do not consent to the construction plans.

== Attraction ==
Tourists frequent campsites or lodges at Epupa, which offer water sports on the river, including rafting and canoeing. Ancient baobab trees grow alongside the gorge, and there is an attractive and well-kept viewpoint high above the village and falls.

<text>Camillien Houde (August 13, 1889 – September 11, 1958) was a Quebec politician, a Member of Parliament, and a four-time mayor of Montreal. He is of the few Canadian politicians to have served at all three levels of government. During World War II, Houde was interned under the War Measures Act for campaigning against conscription.

==Political career==
Houde was born in Montreal on August 13, 1889 and died there on September 11, 1958. He was nicknamed &quot;l&#x27;imprévisible&quot;—the unpredictable. He was the only surviving child of Azade Houde and Josephine Frenette. He is descended from the first Houde ancestor, Louis Houde, who came from Manou, Eure-et-Loir, France to New France in 1647. Louis Houde&#x27;s son was Louis H. who married Marie Lemay in 1685.
He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec as a member of the Conservative Party for the riding of Montréal–Sainte-Marie in the 1923 election. He was defeated in the 1927 election, but re-elected in a by-election on October 24, 1928. He was elected leader of the Conservative Party on July 10, 1929, led the party to defeat in the 1931 election, and failed to win a seat in Montréal–Saint-Jacques after vacating his previous seat. He resigned as Conservative leader on September 19, 1932.

In 1930, Jews in Montreal expressed anger over antisemitic statements made by Houde. During a speech, an audience member had yelled, &quot;To hell with the Jews!&quot; Houde replied, &quot;Well said. They have a new country and if they won&#x27;t meet your demands they can go to Palestine, their country.&quot;

When George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Montreal on the 1939 royal tour of Canada and were greeted by cheering crowds, Houde turned to the King and said: &quot;You know, Your Majesty, some of this is for you.&quot;

He moved to federal politics and lost in a bid for election as a Conservative candidate for the House of Commons of Canada in a 1938 by-election in the Montreal riding of St. Mary. In 1940, he was arrested and charged under the Defence of Canada Regulations. He was imprisoned at Camp Petawawa in Ontario until the end of the war. He ran again in St. Mary, this time as an independent candidate, in the 1945 federal election, but was again defeated. He won a seat as an independent candidate in the riding of Papineau in the 1949 federal election by less than 100 votes. He did not run for re-election in the 1953 election.

Houde became a figure of ridicule in parts of English Canada because of his conduct in opposition to conscription. During the 1949 federal election, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, which openly supported the Liberal Party, attempted to link the unpopular Houde with George Drew, then leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada even though Houde was running as an independent candidate against an official Progressive Conservative candidate. The &quot;Star&quot; accused Drew of making a secret pact with Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis to appoint Houde to the Cabinet as Drew&#x27;s Quebec lieutenant should the Tories win the election. The newspaper&#x27;s campaign reached its culmination the Saturday before the election with a banner front-page headline reading:

(in later editions, the last line was changed to &quot;VOTE ST. LAURENT&quot;).

Concurrent to his career in provincial and federal politics, Houde was mayor of Montreal from 1928 to 1932, from 1934 to 1936, from 1938 to 1940, and from 1944 to 1954.

==World War II controversy==
In 1939, Houde said that &quot;French-Canadians are Fascists by blood&quot;, and stating that if there was a war between Britain and Fascist Italy, he would prefer to side with Italy.

During World War II, Houde campaigned against conscription. On August 2, 1940, Houde publicly urged the men of Quebec to ignore the national registration measure introduced by the federal government. Three days later, he was placed under arrest by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on charges of sedition, and then confined without trial in internment camps in Petawawa, Ontario and Ripples, New Brunswick for four years. Upon his release on August 18, 1944, he was greeted by a cheering crowd of 50,000 Montrealers, and won back his job as Montreal mayor in 1944&#x27;s civic election.

After the war, Houde signed a petition protesting Nazi collaborator Jacques de Bernonville&#x27;s extradition to France.

==Honours==

Houde was made Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur and Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1935 and an Officer of the Order of St John in 1953.

On his death in 1958, Camillien Houde was interred in the Cimetière Notre-Dame-des-Neiges in Montreal, Quebec in an Italian marble replica of Napoleon&#x27;s tomb.

Mayor Houde was a reform-minded mayor in the areas of patronage, unemployment, and organized crime. He was also responsible for some of the major public park improvements in Montreal including the park on Mont Royal with its man-made lake and park facilities. &quot;Camilliennes&quot; were public washrooms built by Houde during the Great Depression.

After his death, Mayor Jean Drapeau named a new road over Mount Royal after Houde, an act many considered ironic, as Houde and many others had long opposed building roads over the city&#x27;s famous mountain.
==Other information==
Mayor Houde threw a party for the then-new fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, which was described by Bill W in the book Alcoholics Anonymous Comes of Age as &quot;probably the first official reception that any A.A. group ever had.&quot;

<doc id="517018" wikidata="Q500497" url="?curid=517018" title="Cercozoa">
<text>Cercozoa (now synonymised with Filosa) is a phylum of diverse single-celled eukaryotes. They lack shared morphological characteristics at the microscopic level, and are instead united by molecular phylogenies of rRNA and actin or polyubiquitin. They were the first major eukaryotic group to be recognized mainly through molecular phylogenies. They are the natural predators of many species of bacteria. They are closely related to the phylum Retaria, comprising amoeboids that usually have complex shells, and together form a supergroup called Rhizaria.

==Characteristics==
The group includes most amoeboids and flagellates that feed by means of filose pseudopods. These may be restricted to part of the cell surface, but there is never a true cytostome or mouth as found in many other protozoa. They show a variety of forms and have proven difficult to define in terms of structural characteristics, although their unity is strongly supported by phylogenetic studies.

==Diversity==
Some cercozoans are grouped by whether they are &quot;filose&quot; or &quot;reticulose&quot; in the behavior of their cytoskeleton when moving:
*Filose, meaning their pseudopods develop as filopodia. For example:
**Euglyphids, filose amoebae with shells of siliceous scales or plates, which are commonly found in soils, nutrient-rich waters, and on aquatic plants.
**&quot;Gromia&quot;, a shelled amoeba.
**Tectofilosids, filose amoebae that produce organic shells.
**Cercomonads, common soil-dwelling amoeboflagellates.
*Reticulose, meaning they form a reticulating net of pseudopods. For example:
**Chlorarachniophytes, set apart by the presence of chloroplasts bound by four membranes and still possess a vestigial nucleus, called a nucleomorph. As such, they have been of great interest to researchers studying the endosymbiotic origins of organelles.
Other important ecological groups are:
*Granofilosea, comprising several groups traditionally considered heliozoa such as Heliomonadida, Desmothoracida and Gymnosphaerida.
*Phaeodaria, marine protozoa previously considered radiolarians.

==Ecology==
As well as being highly diverse in morphology and physiology, Cercozoa also shows high ecological diversity. The phylum Cercozoa includes many of the most abundant and ecologically significant protozoa in soil, marine and freshwater ecosystems.

Soil-dwelling cercozoans are one of the dominant groups of free-living eukaryotic microorganisms found in temperate soils, accounting for around 30% of identifiable protozoan DNA in arid or semi-arid soils and 15% in more humid soils. In transcriptomic analyses they account for 40-60% of all identifiable protozoan RNA found in forest and grassland soils. They also comprise 9-24% of all operational taxonomic units found in the ocean floor.

Some cercozoa are coprophilic or , meaning they use feces as a source of nutrients or as transport through animal hosts. The faecal habitat is an understudied reservoir of microbial eukaryotic diversity, dominated by amoeboflagellates from the phylum Cercozoa. Strongly coprophilic examples of cercozoa are the flagellates &quot;Cercomonas&quot;, &quot;Proleptomonas&quot; and &quot;Helkesimastix&quot;, and the sorocarpic amoeba &quot;Guttulinopsis&quot;. Many new cercozoan lineages, especially among sarcomonads, have been discovered through phylogenetic sampling of feces because they appear preferentially in this medium.

Cercozoan bacterivores (i.e. predators of bacteria) are highly diverse and important in the plant phyllosphere, the leaf surfaces of plants. Particularly sarcomonads, with their ability to cyst, feed and multiply within hours, are perfectly adapted to the fluctuating environmental factors in the phyllosphere. Their predation causes shifts in the bacterial communities: they reduce populations of alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria, which are less resistant to their grazing, in favour of other bacterial populations such as gammaproteobacteria.

==Evolution==
===External evolution===

Originally, Cercozoa contained both Filosa and Endomyxa, according to phylogenetic analyses using ribosomal RNA and tubulin. These analyses also confirmed Cercozoa as the sister group of Retaria within the supergroup Rhizaria.

However, the monophyly of the group was still uncertain. Posterior multigene phylogenetic analyses consistently found Cercozoa to be paraphyletic, because Endomyxa clustered next to Retaria instead of Filosa. Because of this, Endomyxa was excluded from Cercozoa, which became a synonym of Filosa.

More recent phylogenomic analyses with better sampling recovered a sister relationship between Filosa (=Cercozoa) and Endomyxa once again, although the modern classification of eukaryotes retains Endomyxa, Cercozoa and Retaria as separate phyla within Rhizaria.

===Internal evolution===
The phylum Cercozoa previously contained both Filosa and Endomyxa, but in the latest classifications Endomyxa has been excluded, and Cercozoa is now synonymous with Filosa. It is composed of two subphyla: Monadofilosa and Reticulofilosa. According to multigene phylogenetic analyses, Monadofilosa is a robust clade, in which the deepest branching group is Metromonadea, followed by Helkesea as the second group (together forming the paraphyletic Eoglissa) before the divergence of the clade Ventrifilosa (Imbricatea, Sarcomonadea and Thecofilosea). On the other hand, Reticulofilosa is probably paraphyletic, with Granofilosea diverging earlier than Chlorarachnea, which makes Chlorarachnea the sister group of Monadofilosa.

A more recent phylogenomic analysis recovered both Monadofilosa and Reticulofilosa as monophyletic within the clade Filosa.

In addition to the known Granofilosea, Chlorarachnea and Monadofilosa, a variety of clades inside Cercozoa have been discovered in other analyses and have slowly been described and named, such as Tremulida (previously known as Novel Clade 11) and Aquavolonida (Novel Clade 10), although their specific positions among the two main cercozoan subphyla have yet to be refined. These two orders have been classified as the class Skiomonadea, within Reticulofilosa.

==Classification==
The classification of Cercozoa was revised in 2018:
*Subphylum Reticulofilosa 
**Class Chlorarachnea 
**Class Granofilosea 
**Class Skiomonadea 
*Subphylum Monadofilosa 
**Superclass Eoglissa 
***Class Metromonadea 
***Class Helkesea 
**Superclass Ventrifilosa 
***Class Sarcomonadea 
***Class Imbricatea 
***Class Thecofilosea

<doc id="517019" wikidata="Q700583" url="?curid=517019" title="Known-plaintext attack">
<text>The known-plaintext attack (KPA) is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the attacker has access to both the plaintext (called a crib) and its encrypted version (ciphertext). These can be used to reveal secret keys and code books. The term &quot;crib&quot; originated at Bletchley Park, the British World War II decryption operation, where it was defined as:

==History==
The usage &quot;crib&quot; was adapted from a slang term referring to cheating (e.g., &quot;I cribbed my answer from your test paper&quot;). A &quot;crib&quot; originally was a literal or interlinear translation of a foreign-language text—usually a Latin or Greek text—that students might be assigned to translate from the original language.

The idea behind a crib is that cryptologists were looking at incomprehensible ciphertext, but if they had a clue about some word or phrase that might be expected to be in the ciphertext, they would have a &quot;wedge,&quot; a test to break into it. If their otherwise random attacks on the cipher managed to sometimes produce those words or (preferably) phrases, they would know they might be on the right track. When those words or phrases appeared, they would feed the settings they had used to reveal them back into the whole encrypted message to good effect.

In the case of Enigma, the German High Command was very meticulous about the overall security of the Enigma system and understood the possible problem of cribs. The day-to-day operators, on the other hand, were less careful. The Bletchley Park team would guess some of the plaintext based upon when the message was sent, and by recognizing routine operational messages. For instance, a daily weather report was transmitted by the Germans at the same time every day. Due to the regimented style of military reports, it would contain the word &quot;Wetter&quot; (German for &quot;weather&quot;) at the same location in every message. (Knowing the local weather conditions helped Bletchley Park guess other parts of the plaintext as well.) Other operators, too, would send standard salutations or introductions. An officer stationed in the Qattara Depression consistently reported that he had nothing to report. &quot;Heil Hitler,&quot; occurring at the end of a message, is another well-known example.

At Bletchley Park in World War II, strenuous efforts were made to use (and even force the Germans to produce) messages with known plaintext. For example, when cribs were lacking, Bletchley Park would sometimes ask the Royal Air Force to &quot;seed&quot; a particular area in the North Sea with mines (a process that came to be known as gardening, by obvious reference). The Enigma messages that were soon sent out would most likely contain the name of the area or the harbour threatened by the mines.

The Germans themselves could be very accommodating in this regard. Whenever any of the turned German Double-Cross agents sent a message (written by the British) to their respective handlers, they frequently obligingly re-encrypted the message word for word on Enigma for onward transmission to Berlin.

When a captured German revealed under interrogation that Enigma operators had been instructed to encode numbers by spelling them out, Alan Turing reviewed decrypted messages and determined that the number &quot;eins&quot; (&quot;one&quot;) was the most common string in the plaintext (Benford&#x27;s law). He automated the crib process, creating the &quot;Eins Catalogue&quot;, which assumed that &quot;eins&quot; was encoded at all positions in the plaintext. The catalogue included every possible position of the various rotors, starting positions, and keysettings of the Enigma.

The Polish Cipher Bureau had likewise exploited &quot;cribs&quot; in the &quot;ANX method&quot; before World War II (the Germans&#x27; use of &quot;AN&quot;, German for &quot;to&quot;, followed by &quot;X&quot; as a spacer to form the text &quot;ANX&quot;).

The United States and Britain used one-time tape systems, such as the 5-UCO, for their most sensitive traffic. These devices were immune to known-plaintext attack; however, they were point-to-point links and required massive supplies of one-time tapes. Networked cipher machines were considered vulnerable to cribs, and various techniques were used to disguise the beginning and ends of a message, including cutting messages in half and sending the second part first and adding nonsense padding at both ends. The latter practice resulted in an infamous incident during World War II when the nonsense padding &quot;the world wonders&quot; was not nonsensical enough and was misinterpreted as part of the actual message, leading American admiral William Halsey Jr. to change his plans.

The KL-7, introduced in the mid-1950s, was the first U.S. cipher machine that was considered safe against known-plaintext attack.

Classical ciphers are typically vulnerable to known-plaintext attack. For example, a Caesar cipher can be solved using a single letter of corresponding plaintext and ciphertext to decrypt entirely. A general monoalphabetic substitution cipher needs several character pairs and some guessing if there are fewer than 26 distinct pairs.

<text>Mary-Ellis Bunim (July 9, 1946 – January 29, 2004) was an American television producer and co-creator of MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Real World&quot; and &quot;Road Rules&quot;.

==Biography==
A native of Massachusetts, Bunim began her career in daytime dramas. She oversaw more than 2,500 hours of programming as executive producer of &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; (1974–1981), &quot;As the World Turns&quot; (1981–1984), &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; (1984–1987) and &quot;Loving&quot; (1989–1990). She subsequently developed numerous shows in her job as VP of tape programs for New World Entertainment.

Bunim founded Bunim-Murray with business partner Jonathan Murray. Agent Mark Itkin of the William Morris Agency put the two together to develop a scripted soap opera for MTV. When that was too expensive, they decided to try an unscripted soap and &quot;The Real World&quot; was born. &quot;We knew within 20 minutes of shooting that we had a show,&quot; Bunim said.

Her company, Bunim/Murray Productions, spearheaded the reality show genre. Among the numerous other reality programs and reality game show programs that Bunim co-created over the years, include: &quot;Road Rules&quot;; &quot;Love Cruise&quot;; &quot;Making the Band&quot;; &quot;The Challenge&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Real World/Road Rules Challenge&quot; and spun off from &quot;The Real World&quot; and &quot;Road Rules&quot;); the reality feature film, &quot;The Real Cancun&quot;; the real-life daily syndication, &quot;Starting Over&quot;; as well as Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Simple Life&quot;.

==Death==
Bunim died in Los Angeles at 57, after a lengthy battle with breast cancer.

She is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

Bunim and Murray were inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 2012.

<doc id="517028" wikidata="Q355416" url="?curid=517028" title="Michel Aflaq">
<text>Michel Aflaq (‎, ; 9 January 1910 – 23 June 1989) was a Syrian philosopher, sociologist and Arab nationalist. His ideas played a significant role in the development of Ba&#x27;athism and its political movement; he is considered by several Ba&#x27;athists to be the principal founder of Ba&#x27;athist thought. He published various books during his lifetime, such as &quot;The Road to Renaissance&quot; (1940), &quot;The Battle for One Destiny&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Struggle Against Distorting the Movement of Arab Revolution&quot; (1975).

Born into a middle-class family in Damascus, Syria, Aflaq studied at the Sorbonne, where he met his future political companion Salah al-Din al-Bitar. He returned to Syria, then part of the French-ruled Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, in 1932, beginning his political career in communist politics. Aflaq became a communist activist, but broke his ties with the communist movement when the Syrian–Lebanese Communist Party supported colonial policies through the Popular Front under the French Mandate of Syria. Later in 1940 Aflaq and al-Bitar established the Arab Ihya Movement (later renaming itself the &quot;Arab Ba&#x27;ath Movement&quot;, taking the name from Zaki al-Arsuzi&#x27;s group by the same name). The movement proved successful, and in 1947 the Arab Ba&#x27;ath Movement merged with al-Arsuzi&#x27;s Arab Ba&#x27;ath organisation to establish the Arab Ba&#x27;ath Party. Aflaq was elected to the party&#x27;s executive committee and was elected &quot;&#x27;Amid&quot; (meaning the party&#x27;s leader).

The Arab Ba&#x27;ath Party merged with Akram al-Hawrani&#x27;s Arab Socialist Party to establish the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party in 1952; Aflaq was elected the party&#x27;s leader in 1954. During the mid-to-late 1950s the party began developing relations with Gamal Abdel Nasser, the President of Egypt, which eventually led to the establishment of the United Arab Republic (UAR). Nasser forced Aflaq to dissolve the party, which he did, but without consulting with party members. Shortly after the UAR&#x27;s dissolution, Aflaq was reelected as Secretary General of the National Command of the Ba&#x27;ath Party. Following the 8th of March Revolution, Aflaq&#x27;s position within the party was weakened to such an extent that he was forced to resign as the party&#x27;s leader in 1965. Aflaq was ousted during the 1966 Syrian coup d&#x27;état, which led to a schism within the Ba&#x27;ath Party. He escaped to Lebanon, but later went to Iraq. In 1968 Aflaq was elected Secretary General of the Iraqi-led Ba&#x27;ath Party; during his tenure he held no &quot;de facto&quot; power. He held the post until his death on 23 June 1989.

Aflaq&#x27;s theories about society, economics, and politics, which are collectively known as Ba&#x27;athism, hold that the Arab world needs to be unified into one Arab Nation in order to achieve an advanced state of development. He was critical of both capitalism and communism, and critical of Karl Marx&#x27;s view of dialectical materialism as the only truth. Ba&#x27;athist thought placed much emphasis on liberty and Arab socialism – a socialism with Arab characteristics, which was not part of the international socialist movement as defined by the West. Aflaq believed in the separation of state and religion, and was a strong believer in secularisation, but was against atheism. Although a Christian, he believed Islam to be proof of &quot;Arab genius&quot;. In the aftermath of the 1966 Ba&#x27;ath Party split, the Syrian-led Ba&#x27;ath Party accused Aflaq of stealing al-Arsuzi&#x27;s ideas, calling him a &quot;thief&quot; and later sentenced him to &quot;death &quot;via absentia&quot;&quot; in 1971. The Iraqi-led Ba&#x27;ath Party rejects this, and does not believe that al-Arsuzi contributed to Ba&#x27;athist thought.

== Early life ==
Born on 9 January 1910 in Damascus to a middle class Orthodox Christian family, his father, Joseph, worked as a grain merchant. Aflaq was first educated in the Westernised schools of the French-ruled Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. In 1929, he left Syria to study philosophy abroad at the Sorbonne in Paris. During his stay, Aflaq was influenced by the works of Henri Bergson and met his longtime collaborator Salah al-Din al-Bitar, a fellow Syrian nationalist. Aflaq founded an Arab Student Union at the Sorbonne and discovered the writings of Karl Marx. He returned to Syria in 1932, and became active in communist politics, but left the movement when the government of Léon Blum, supported by the French Communist Party (PCF), continued France&#x27;s old politics towards its colonies. Aflaq, and others, had believed that the PCF followed pro-independence policies towards the French colonies. It did not help that the Syrian–Lebanese Communist Party (SLCP) supported the PCF&#x27;s decision. From then on Aflaq saw the communist movement as a tool of the Soviet Union. He was impressed by the organisation and ideology of Antun Saadeh&#x27;s Syrian Social Nationalist Party.

=== Arab Ba&#x27;ath Movement: 1940–1947 ===

Upon their return to Syria, Aflaq and al-Bitar became teachers at Tajhiz all&#x27;-Ula, &quot;the most prestigious secondary school in Syria&quot;. Aflaq taught history, while al-Bitar taught math and physics. By 1940, Aflaq and al-Bitar had managed to set up a student circle, which usually met on Fridays. That year, the Arab Ihya Movement, a political party, was established by Aflaq and al-Bitar. They used most of their spare time in 1941 to agitate for the party. It was in 1942 that Aflaq showed his skills as &quot;a compelling speaker&quot; who was able to utilize the &quot;theatrical pause&quot; to great effect. The party changed its name to &quot;Arab Ba&#x27;ath Movement&quot; to signify the radical changes which were sweeping the Middle East; Rashid Ali al-Gaylani, the Prime Minister of Iraq, had challenged Britain&#x27;s domination over Iraq. The replacement of the word &quot;Revival&quot; with &quot;Ba&#x27;ath&quot; (, literally means &quot;resurrection&quot;/&quot;rebirth&quot;) signified that Arab revival had been replaced ideologically by the need for an Arab rebirth. The change of name led Zaki al-Arsuzi, leader of the Arab Ba&#x27;ath Party, to accuse Aflaq and al-Bitar of stealing his party&#x27;s name from him. Though both men were promoting a party platform based on an Arab nationalist stance, Aflaq and al-Arsuzi became bitter rivals.

On 24 October 1942, both Aflaq and al-Bitar resigned from their teaching positions, now determined to devote themselves fully to the political struggle. In 1941 the Syrian Committee to Help Iraq was established to support the Iraqi Government led by Rashid Ali al-Gaylani against the British invasion during the Anglo–Iraqi War. Al-Arsuzi, the leader of the other Arab Ba&#x27;ath movement, was skeptical of the new committee, and opposed helping the Iraqis on the ground that they would lose anyway. In 1941 the movement began publishing documents under the name the &quot;Arab Ihya Movement&quot;. Later, in 1945, Aflaq and al-Bitar asked the French Mandate authorities to grant the movement a party license. The Arab Ba&#x27;ath Movement did not become an official party until 1947, when it merged with al-Arsuzi&#x27;s Arab Ba&#x27;ath Movement to found the Arab Ba&#x27;ath Party. The Arab Ba&#x27;ath Movement, led by Aflaq and al-Bitar, drew supporters from al-Arsuzi&#x27;s Ba&#x27;ath Movement; during the 1940s, al-Arsuzi started to seclude himself from the public eye; he developed a deep distrust of others and became, according to some of his associates, paranoid. When the two Ba&#x27;ath movements merged and established the Arab Ba&#x27;ath Party in 1947, the only subject discussed was how much socialism to include; Wahib al-Ghanim and Jalal al-Sayyid from the al-Arsuzi-led Ba&#x27;ath movement wanted Aflaq and al-Bitar to adopt more radical socialist policies.

=== Founding and early years ===
The Arab Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s first congress was held in Damascus in 1947. Aflaq took the pre-eminent position of &quot;Amid&quot; (sometimes translated as &#x27;doyen&#x27; or as &#x27;leader&#x27;) and was elected to a four-member executive committee. Under the constitution adopted at the congress, this made him effective leader of the party, with sweeping powers within the organisation; al-Bitar was elected Secretary General of the National Command. Zaki al-Arsuzi, the leader of the Arab Ba&#x27;ath, was not given any position, or membership in the party. Aflaq as &quot;Amid&quot; was responsible for ideological affairs and became the party&#x27;s mentor, while al-Bitar controlled the party&#x27;s day-to-day management. The merger would prove problematic; several members of the al-Arsuzi-led Ba&#x27;ath Party were more left-leaning, and would become, later in Aflaq&#x27;s tenure as leader, highly critical of his leadership.

In the late 1940s, Aflaq and al-Bitar gave free lessons on Ba&#x27;athist thought, and in 1948 they established the newspaper &quot;al-Ba&#x27;ath&quot;. Aflaq tested the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s strength during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War: after early Syrian defeats, he led several demonstrations against the government led by President Shukri al-Quwatli. He personally led demonstrations and claimed that al-Quwatli, a landowner, was a corrupt and capitalistic politician, who was to blame for the Syrian army&#x27;s defeat. Aflaq called for al-Quwatli&#x27;s resignation, and wrote several &quot;al-Ba&#x27;ath&quot; articles criticising his presidency and his prime minister, Jamil Mardam Bey. Aflaq was later arrested on the orders of Prime Minister Mardam Bey. Al-Quwatli&#x27;s government was brought down in a coup d&#x27;état led by military officer Husni al-Za&#x27;im. Al-Za&#x27;im banned all parties, claiming that Syria was not ready to establish a liberal democracy yet. Aflaq, who had been set free, was rearrested during al-Zai&#x27;m&#x27;s presidency and sent to the notorious Mezzeh Prison. Al-Za&#x27;im&#x27;s rule did not last for long, and in August 1949, he was toppled, and Hashim al-Atassi, who was democratically elected, took his place. Al-Atassi established a national unity government, and Aflaq was appointed to the post of Minister of Education, the only government post he would ever hold; he held it from August to December 1949. Al-Attasi&#x27;s presidency did not last for very long either, and in 1951 Adib Shishakli took power in a military coup.

Aflaq at first extended his support to the new government, believing that he and the Ba&#x27;ath Party could collaborate with Shishakli because they shared the same Arab nationalist sentiments. His analysis of Shishakli proved to be wrong, and one of Shishakli&#x27;s first decisions as ruler was to ban all political parties, including the Ba&#x27;ath Party. The Ba&#x27;ath Party leadership, and several leading members, escaped to Lebanon in the wake of increased government repression. In Lebanon Aflaq and al-Bitar agreed to a merger of the Arab Ba&#x27;ath Party and the Arab Socialist Party (ASP), led by Akram al-Hawrani, to establish the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party in 1952. The newly formed party worked as a base of operation against Shishali&#x27;s rule. Aflaq and the rest cooperated with non-Ba&#x27;athist opposition forces too. Shishakli was toppled in February 1954.

=== Power politics: 1954–1963 ===

Following the overthrow of al-Shishakli, Syria held its first democratic elections in five years. The Ba&#x27;ath Party, led by Aflaq, al-Bitar and al-Hawrani, had 22 members elected to parliament. This increase in influence can largely be attributed to al-Hawrani – several old ASP strongholds voted for the Ba&#x27;ath Party because of al-Hawrani&#x27;s presence. By this time Aflaq was losing much of his power to al-Hawrani and his supporters, who were in a majority in the party. Proof of this was the decision of the Ba&#x27;ath Party to collaborate openly with the Syrian Communist Party (SCP), a move Aflaq opposed. Aflaq was elected the party&#x27;s Secretary General of the newly established National Command, a title equivalent to &#x27;party leader&#x27;, by the party&#x27;s Second National Congress.

When, under the United Arab Republic (UAR), Aflaq was forced by Nasser to dissolve the party, he disbanded the party by himself, instead of convening a congress on the matter. The UAR proved to be disastrous for the Ba&#x27;ath Party – the party was sidelined to a great extent by Nasser&#x27;s government. The Ba&#x27;ath movement, which in 1958 was on the verge of becoming the dominant Arab nationalist movement, found itself in disarray after three years of Nasserist rule. Only a handful of Ba&#x27;athists were given public office in the UAR&#x27;s government; al-Hawrani became vice president and al-Bitar became Minister of Culture and Guidance. Several members, mostly young, blamed Aflaq for this situation; it was he who dissolved the party in 1958 without consulting the National Congress. Hafez al-Assad and Salah Jadid amongst others, eventually established the Military Committee to save the Syrian Ba&#x27;ath movement from annihilation. The party&#x27;s Third National Congress in 1959 supported Aflaq&#x27;s decision to dissolve the party, but a 1960 National Congress, in which Jadid was a delegate representing the then-unknown Military Committee, reversed the decision and called for the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s reestablishment. The Congress also decided to improve relations with Nasser by democratising the UAR from within. A faction within the party, led by al-Hawrani, called for Syria&#x27;s secession. When the UAR broke up in 1961, some members applauded the dissolution, such as al-Bitar.

The Ba&#x27;ath Party captured 20 seats, down from 22, in the 1961 election. In 1962, after four years, Aflaq convened the Fifth Congress in Homs. Al-Hawrani was not invited; cells that had stayed active and defied Aflaq&#x27;s orders, and Ba&#x27;athists who became Nasserists during the period of the UAR, were not invited to the congress. Aflaq was reelected as the National Command&#x27;s secretary general, and ordered the reestablishment of the Syrian-regional Ba&#x27;ath organisation. During the congress, Aflaq and the Military Committee, through Muhammad Umran, made contact for the first time; the committee asked for permission to initiate a coup d&#x27;état; Aflaq supported the conspiracy. Following the success of the February 1963 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état, led by the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s Iraqi Regional Branch, the Military Committee hastily convened to hatch a coup against Nazim al-Kudsi&#x27;s presidency. The 8th of March Revolution, a military coup launched in 1963, proved successful, and a Ba&#x27;athist government in Syria was established. The plotters&#x27; first order was to establish the National Council of the Revolutionary Command (NCRC), consisting entirely of Ba&#x27;athists and Nasserists, and controlled by military personnel rather than civilians from the very beginning.

=== The beginning: 1963–1964 ===

The relationship between the Ba&#x27;athists and the Nasserists was at best, uncomfortable. The Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s rise to power in Iraq and Syria put Nasser, as he put it, &quot;between the hammer and the anvil&quot;. The establishment of a union between Iraq and Syria would weaken his credentials as a pan-Arab leader. Nasser started launching bitter propaganda attacks against the party; Aflaq was dismissed as an ineffectual theorist who was mocked as a puppet &quot;Roman emperor&quot; and accused of being a &quot;Cypriot Christian&quot;. In several Ba&#x27;ath Party meetings, Aflaq responded with pure anger, and became an anti-Nasserist. Because of the position he took, Aflaq had a falling out with al-Bitar who still believed there was a chance to reestablish good ties with Nasser.

The break with Nasser weakened the original leaders of the Ba&#x27;ath Party, which in turn gave the Military Committee room to expand. After taking power, the Military Committee looked for theoretical guidance, but instead of going to Aflaq to solve problems (which was usual before), they contacted the party&#x27;s Marxist faction led by Hammud al-Shufi. At the Syrian Ba&#x27;athist Regional Congress, the Military Committee &quot;proved&quot; that it was rebelling equally against Aflaq and the traditional leadership, as against their moderate social and economic policies. The Military Committee was bent on removing Aflaq from a position of power, believing that he had become old and frail. At the Sixth National Congress held in October 1963, Aflaq was barely able to hold on to his post as Secretary General – the Marxist factions led by al-Shufi and Ali Salih al-Sa&#x27;di, in Syria and Iraq respectively, were the majority group. Another problem facing Aflaq was that several of his colleagues were not elected to party office; for instance, al-Bitar was not reelected to a seat in the National Command. Instead of the traditional civilian leadership, a new leadership consisting of military officers was gradually growing; Jadid and Amin al-Hafiz from Syria and Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and Salih Mahdi Ammash from Iraq were elected to the National Command. While the Military Committee was in fact taking control over the Ba&#x27;ath Party from the civilian leadership, they were sensitive to such criticism, and stated, in an ideological pamphlet, that civilian-military symbiosis was of major importance if socialist reconstruction was to be achieved. To the outside world, Aflaq seemed to be in charge. The Tunisian newspaper &quot;&quot; referred to him as &quot;The philosopher who made two coups [Iraqi and Syrian coups] in a month&quot;.

The Ba&#x27;ath movement was not running as smoothly as the rest of the world believed; the Iraqi Regional Branch was already starting to lose membership. The Iraqi military and the party&#x27;s militant arm, the National Guard, detested each other. Al-Sadi, the Regional Secretary of the Iraqi Regional Branch, was eventually exiled to Madrid, Spain on 11 November by several military officers and moderate Ba&#x27;athists. An anxious Aflaq hastily traveled from Syria and dissolved the Regional Command of the Iraqi Regional Branch, exclaiming that the National Command would rule Iraq in its place until a new Regional Command was elected. This was not greeted warmly by the majority of Iraqi military officers and Ba&#x27;athists – the idea that a Christian was to rule over a Muslim country was considered &quot;insensitive&quot;.

The situation in Iraq did not improve, Abdul Salam Arif, the President of Iraq and a Nasserist, plotted a coup against the Ba&#x27;ath Party on 18 November, which succeeded. The dream of cornering Nasser&#x27;s pan-Arab project was over; instead, it was Nasser and the Nasserists who were cornering the Ba&#x27;ath movement. On hearing the news, Aflaq and several Ba&#x27;athists fled Iraq for Syria.

=== The schism: 1964–1965 ===
After a falling out with the Military Committee, of which he was a member, Muhammad Umran told Aflaq about the committee&#x27;s secret plans to oust the civilian leadership, led by Aflaq, and take over the Ba&#x27;ath Party. Shortly after, Umran was sent into exile as Ambassador to Spain for supporting the Aflaq faction. Aflaq responded to the threat posed to his leadership by invoking his office as secretary general, and calling for the National Command to dissolve the Regional Command. He was forced to withdraw his request when the majority of Ba&#x27;ath Party members proved to oppose such a move. A contest for power between Aflaq and the Military Committee ensued in the open; but it was a struggle Aflaq was losing. It was plain from the very beginning that the initiative lay with the anti-Aflaq forces. To counter the military threat, Aflaq invoked party rules and regulations against them. To counter this, the Military Committee befriended a staunchly anti-Aflaq civilian faction calling themselves the &quot;Regionalists&quot; – this group had not dissolved their party organisations as ordered by Aflaq in the 1950s.

The Regional Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch, in March 1965, devolved power from the center, the National Command, to the Regional Command. From then on, the Regional Secretary of the Regional Command was considered Syria&#x27;s &quot;ex officio&quot; head of state. The Regional Secretary had the power to appoint the prime minister, the cabinet, the chief of staff and top military commanders. Aflaq was unsettled by the way things were moving, and in May he convened the Eighth National Congress to get a showdown between his followers and those of the Military Committee. However, this never came to fruition. Several civilian members of the National Command, such as the Lebanese Jibran Majdalani and the Saudi Ali Ghannam, advised caution, believing that if he pressed the Military Committee too hard the military would take over the Syrian Regional Branch, and then the Ba&#x27;ath Party – as had happened in Iraq following the ousting of the Iraqi Regional Branch.
Because of their concerns, Aflaq kept quiet. But to his astonishment, keeping quiet caused him to lose his post as Secretary General – Aflaq was succeeded as Secretary General of the National Command by Munif al-Razzaz, a Jordanian of Syrian origin. However, the power between the two camps was unexpectedly reshuffled when Amin al-Hafiz defected to Aflaq&#x27;s camp. In contrast to other military officers al-Hafiz had very little influence within or outside the party. Al-Hafiz&#x27;s defection led to a resurgence of activity within Aflaq&#x27;s faction. Al-Bitar and Umran were brought back from Spain to form a new government.

=== Downfall: 1966–1968 ===

Al-Razzaz, Aflaq&#x27;s successor as secretary general, came from the pro-Aflaq faction. With the defection of al-Hafez, he ordered that the National Command was the &quot;de jure&quot; ruling body of the Ba&#x27;ath Party. He appointed al-Bitar prime minister, Umran defence minister, Mansur al-Atrash as Chairman of the National Council of the Revolutionary Command and al-Hafiz retained his post as President of Syria. Salah Jadid, the Military Committee&#x27;s strongman, responded by arresting several Umran supporters. Umran responded by dismissing a handful of pro-Jadid officials. The most important of these dismissals was the removal of Ahmad Suwaydani from the post of head of the country&#x27;s military intelligence to head of the Officer Administration. On 23 February a coup d&#x27;état led by Jadid and Hafez al-Assad overthrew the Syrian Government and the Ba&#x27;ath Party leadership. Aflaq was exiled from Syria, and ordered never to return to his homeland. Members of the party&#x27;s other factions fled; Aflaq was captured and detained, along with other pro-Aflaq supporters, in a government guest house. When the new rulers launched a purge in August that year, Aflaq managed to make his escape, with the help of Nasim Al Safarjalani and Malek Bashour, both closely trusted friends and colleagues, and hence was able to flee to Beirut, Lebanon, and later to Brazil.

Aflaq&#x27;s downfall caused a split within the Ba&#x27;ath Party; the party was &quot;de facto&quot; dissolved and two Ba&#x27;ath Parties were established, one Iraqi-led Ba&#x27;ath Party and one Syrian-led Ba&#x27;ath Party. The Syrian-led party was led by Jadid and his supporters and hailed Zaki al-Arsuzi, the founder of the Arab Ba&#x27;ath in 1940, as the father of Ba&#x27;athist thought, while the Iraqi-led party led by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein, still proclaimed Aflaq to be the founder of Ba&#x27;athist thought. In February 1966 at the Ninth National Congress, held after the coup which ousted the pro-Aflaq faction, the Iraqi delegation split with the Syrian Ba&#x27;athists. The Iraqis held the &quot;true&quot; Ninth National Congress in February 1968 in Beirut, and elected Aflaq as Secretary General of the National Command. Aflaq&#x27;s election to the secretary generalship also proved to be his final break with al-Bitar; before the congress convened al-Bitar announced that he had left the Ba&#x27;ath Party and given up on the Ba&#x27;athist movement as a whole. 

=== Iraqi-led Ba&#x27;ath Party: 1968–1989 ===
Aflaq moved to Baghdad following his reelection to the secretary generalship in February 1968. He stayed there until 1970, when Black September happened, he criticized the Ba&#x27;ath leadership for doing too little to help the Palestine Liberation Organisation during the conflict. During the conflict, Aflaq lobbied extensively for Yasser Arafat and the PLO. Aflaq wanted Iraqi intervention; al-Bakr, however, refused to get Iraq involved in such a conflict. Because of this, Aflaq returned to Lebanon in self-imposed exile. The government of Hafez al-Assad, the President of Syria, condemned Aflaq to death in absentia in 1971.

== Later life and death ==
After four years of self-imposed exile Aflaq returned to Iraq in 1974, a year before the Lebanese Civil War broke out. He refrained from taking part in Iraqi politics. He published several works during this period, the most notable being &quot;The Struggle Against Distorting the Movement of Arab Revolution&quot; in 1975. Aflaq regained some of his influence when he befriended Saddam Hussein, President of Iraq from 1979 until 2003. During the Iran–Iraq War the Iranian leadership accused Hussein of being under the control of a Christian, and Aflaq himself was labelled &quot;a Christian infidel&quot;. Effectively, throughout his tenure as secretary general in Iraq, Aflaq was given all due honour as the founder of the Ba&#x27;ath movement, but on policy-making, he was ignored.

Aflaq died on 23 June 1989 in Paris, after undergoing heart surgery there.

== Alleged conversion to Islam ==

Saddam Hussein claimed that Aflaq converted to Islam before his death. According to anonymous Western diplomats, Aflaq&#x27;s own family disagreed with that claim; however, Aflaq&#x27;s son, Iyad, confirmed that his father thought about conversion in 1980. Upon his disputed conversion, he supposedly adopted &quot;Ahmed&quot; as a first name. According to the German orientalists Martin Robbe and Gerhard Höpp, the conversion happened before 1988. Regardless of the disagreements about his religion, he was given an Islamic funeral. According to the Berkley Center, anonymous members of Aflaq&#x27;s family claimed that Aflaq&#x27;s conversion was a &quot;lie&quot; made up by Saddam Hussein which he used as a tool to distance Ba&#x27;athism from Christianity. The tomb constructed on the orders of Hussein was later used as a military barrack by American soldiers after the 2003 American invasion of Iraq for troops stationed within the Green Zone. Aflaq&#x27;s family reported that the tomb was badly damaged during the invasion.

== Funeral ==

Upon his death in 1989 he was given a state funeral. A large tomb and mausoleum were erected to form a shrine for him. The tomb, widely regarded as a work of great artistic merit, designed by Iraqi architect Chadagee, was located on the western grounds of the Ba&#x27;ath Party Pan-Arab Headquarters, at the intersection of Al-Kindi street and the Qadisiyyah Expressway overpass. Although there were rumors and accusations that his tomb was destroyed during the 2003 Iraq War, the burial chamber and building above it were left untouched. Its blue-tiled dome can be seen above the concrete T-walls surrounding the Camp&#x27;s perimeter. 

== Thought ==


=== &quot;Unity, liberty, socialism&quot; ===
The Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party slogan &quot;Unity, liberty, socialism&quot; is the key tenet of Aflaq&#x27;s and Ba&#x27;athist thought. Unity meant the unification of the Arab people into one nation, the Arab Nation. The creation of an Arab Nation would have direct implications on Arab development. The establishment of this new state would lead to an Arab Ba&#x27;ath (literally meaning &quot;renaissance&quot;). The Arab nations of his time could only progressively &quot;decline&quot; if not unified; these nations had various ailments – &quot;feudalism, sectarianism, regionalism, intellectual reactionism&quot;. The only way to &quot;cure&quot; the Arab nations was, according to Aflaq, through a revolutionary movement. Aflaq was influenced by Marxism in that he saw the need for a vanguard party to rule the Arab Nation for an indefinite period of time (the period would be a transition from the old to the new).

The need for liberty was one of the defining features of Ba&#x27;athism; however, this was not liberty in the sense used by liberal democracies. Aflaq was a strong believer in pluralism of thought, but against pluralism in the form of votes. In theory, the Ba&#x27;ath Party would rule, and guide the people, in a transitional period of time without consulting the people because the party knew what was right.

The last tenet, &#x27;socialism&#x27;, did not mean socialism as it is defined in the West, but rather a unique form of Arab socialism, a term coined by Aflaq. Socialism, in its original form in the Arab world had, according to Aflaq, first come into being under the rule of Muhammad. The point of Arab socialism was not to answer questions such as: how much state control was necessary, or economic equality; but instead Arab socialism was a system that freed the Arab people from oppression and enslavement, which in turn created independent individuals.

Aflaq opposed Marx&#x27;s view that dialectical materialism was the only truth, but believed that the &quot;importance of material economic conditions in life&quot; was one of the greatest discoveries in modern history. Even so, Aflaq was critical of both capitalism and communism, and did not want either of the two power blocs to collapse during the Cold War, believing that the Cold War was a sort of check and balance on their power. For more than 2 decades, Michel Aflaq&#x27;s essay compilation titled &quot;Fi Sabil al-Ba&#x27;ath&quot; (trans: &quot;The Road to Renaissance&quot;) was the primary ideological book of the Ba&#x27;ath party. The work was published by Aflaq in 1940.

=== Views on religion ===

Aflaq&#x27;s advocacy of a national revival conflicted with the problem of reconciling goals of Arab nationalism with the universal Islamic values so engrained in Arab life. His answer was to assert that Islam was the most sublime expression of Arabism: one had grown out of the other and there is no contradiction between them. He argued that Islam, from its inception, revealed in Arabic Qur&#x27;an, meets Arab needs, embodies Arab values and launched Arabs on their conquest of the known world. The idea of Islam being a culture rather than a faith took special attention from Arab Christians such as Aflaq. These views, however, were highly unorthodox and controversial when aired in lectures at Damascus University. They garnered significant criticism from devout Muslims, who viewed the suggestion that the Arab genius was the flowering of Islam rather than the revelation of God as offensive. Additionally, Christians accused him of selling out and nicknamed him &#x27;Muhammed Aflaq&#x27;. 

Being influenced by a mixture of radical Hobbesian and Marxist ideas, Michel Aflaq viewed religion as the &quot;opiate of the masses&quot;, which subverted efforts for the advancement of a socialist revolution. In 1956, Aflaq asserted that religion was a tool used by the elites of the traditional social order to maintain a corrupt system which facilitated the oppression and exploitation of the weaker classes of the society. He also claimed that religion was regularly exploited by oppressive elites to sedate the people and prevent the outbreak of mass revolutions against the prevailing socio-political order. Aflaq wrote in &quot;Fi Sabil al-Ba&#x27;ath&quot;: &quot;... the oppressed who see religion in this era a weapon that the oppressors rely upon ... those who exploit the corrupt situation exploit this corruption because it drugs the people and because it prevents the people from a revolution against its oppressors and its enslavers.&quot;

What Aflaq saw in Islam was a revolutionary movement. In contrast to other nationalities, the Arab awakening and expansion was attributed to a religious message. Because of this, Aflaq believed that the Arabs&#x27; spirituality was directly linked to Islam. Therefore, one could never take Islam out of the equation of what is essentially, and essentially is not, Arab. Arab nationalism, just as Islam had been during the lifetime of Muhammad, was a spiritual revolutionary movement, leading the Arabs towards a new renaissance: Arab nationalism was the second revolution to appear in the Arab world. All Arab religious communities should, according to Aflaq, respect and worship the spirituality of Islam, even if they did not worship Islam in a religious sense – Aflaq was a Christian who worshipped Islam. Aflaq did not believe it was necessary to worship Muhammad, but believed that all Arabs should strive to emulate Muhammad. In the words of Aflaq himself, Arabs &quot;belong to the nation that gave birth to a Muhammad; or rather, because this Arab individual is a member of the community which Muhammad put all his efforts into creating […] Muhammad was all the Arabs; let us today make all the Arabs Muhammad.&quot; The Muslim of Muhammad&#x27;s days were, according to Aflaq, synonymous with Arabs – the Arabs were the only ones to preach the message of Islam during Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime. In contrast to Jesus, who was a religious leader, but not a political leader, Muhammad was both – the first leader of Islam and of the Arab world. Therefore, secularisation could not take the same shape in the Arab world as it did in the West.

Aflaq called on all Arabs, both Muslim and non-Muslim alike, to admire the role Islam had played in creating the Arab character. But his view on Islam was purely spiritual, and Aflaq emphasised that Islam &quot;should not be imposed&quot; on state and society. Time and again Aflaq emphasised that the Ba&#x27;ath party was against atheism, but also equally against fundamentalism. For him, any fundamentalism represented a &quot;shallow, false faith.&quot; According to Ba&#x27;athist ideology, all religions were equal. Despite his anti-atheist stance, Aflaq was a strong supporter of secular government, and stated that a Ba&#x27;athist state would replace religion with a state &quot;based on a foundation – Arab nationalism, and a moral – freedom.&quot;

== Reception and legacy ==

Fouad Ajami criticised Aflaq for a lack of real substance, stating, &quot;Nearly three hundred pages of text yield no insight, on his part, into what went wrong and what needed to be done; there is only the visible infatuation with words&quot;, and &quot;Aflaq summons the party to renounce power and go back to its &#x27;pure essence&#x27;. There is some truth in this critique.&quot; Aflaq spent much time and energy writing optimistically about the future, and the past, of the Arab Nation, and how the Arab World could be unified. As Kanan Makiya, the author of &quot;Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq&quot;, notes: for &quot;Aflaq, reality is confined to the inner world of the party.&quot; In contrast to other philosophers, such as Karl Marx or John Locke, Aflaq&#x27;s ideological view of the world makes no clear stand on the materialistic or socioeconomic behavior of humanity. While other philosophers make distinctions between what is real and what is not real, that is between prescriptive and descriptive analysis, Aflaq did not as a rule define what &quot;is&quot; and what &quot;ought&quot; to be. In his thought, both are molded into the same category: that which is &quot;attainable&quot;.

In contrast to his longtime friend and colleague Salah al-Din al-Bitar, who was more practical when it came to politics, Aflaq was a &quot;visionary, the dreamer rather unfitted for political life&quot;. Aflaq was described by his associates as an &quot;ascetic, shy and intense figure living a simple and unpretentious life.&quot; He has been accused of seeking help from other people instead of fulfilling his goal by himself or with others he led; Aflaq collaborated with Gamal Abdel Nasser, Abd al-Karim Qasim and Abdul Rahman Arif in 1958, to Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and Ali Salih al-Sadi in 1963 and finally in the 1970s to Saddam Hussein. There are several Ba&#x27;athists, mostly from the Syrian-led Ba&#x27;ath Party, who believe Aflaq stole Ba&#x27;athist ideology from its original founder, Zaki al-Arsuzi. These individuals have denounced, and labelled, Aflaq as a &quot;thief&quot;.

In his writings, Aflaq had been stridently in favor of free speech and other human rights and aid for the lower classes. During the Military Committee&#x27;s gradual takeover of power in Syria, Aflaq rallied against what he saw as the establishment of a military dictatorship, instead of the democracy for which Aflaq had planned. These ideals were never realized by the governments that used his ideology. Most scholars see the Assad government in Syria and Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government in Iraq to have only employed Aflaq&#x27;s ideology as a pretense for dictatorship.

<text>Magna International Inc. is a Canadian parts manufacturer for automakers. It is one of the largest companies in Canada and was recognized on the 2020 &quot;Forbes&quot; Global 2000. The company is the largest automobile parts manufacturer in North America by sales of original equipment parts; it has ranked consistently in the Fortune Global 500 list for 20 years in a row since 2001. It produces automotive systems, assemblies, modules, and components, which are supplied to General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, as well as BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Toyota, Tesla, and Tata Motors, among others.

The company is headquartered in Aurora, Ontario, and its chief executive officer is Swamy Kotagiri. It has 158,000 employees in 342 manufacturing operations and 91 product development, engineering and sales centres in 27 countries. Magna is governed under a corporate constitution which calls for distribution of profits to employees and shareholders. The terms of this contract are a &quot;fair enterprise system&quot; according to company founder Frank Stronach.

==History==
In 1957, Frank Stronach founded Multimatic Investments Ltd in a tool-and-die rented garage out of Toronto. Its first automotive industry contract for metal sun visor brackets was with General Motors in 1959.

By the late 1960s, the company was operating in eight plants. Stronach took Multimatic Investments public in 1969 through a merger with Magna Electronics Corporation, an aerospace, defence and industrial components company, and became known as Magna International in 1973.

The company developed an employee equity participation and profit-sharing program in 1974. By 1981, Magna had sold its aerospace and defence operations to focus on the automotive industry. It began decentralizing major systems into independent, publicly traded companies during the 1990s, while expanding into Asia.

Magna began designing automotive rearview cameras for Hummers in 2005 on its production line in Michigan, US, which were not a federal requirement at the time. It was one of the first to develop rearview cameras for automakers, and had a 350,000 unit contract by 2007. The company has produced more than 46 million components and opened a $66.5 million plant to produce cameras and driver-assistance components.

In February 2015, Samsung SDI agreed to purchase the battery pack business from Magna Steyr, an Austrian operating unit of Magna International, for $120 million. Magna International partnered with Argus Cyber Security after joining in a 2015 Series B funding round to access the company&#x27;s security technology. The company sold its interiors business, which includes door and instrument panels, overhead systems and cargo management parts, to Grupo Antolin in August 2015. The sale to Grupo Antolin included 36 plants and 12,000 employees in Europe, North America and Asia, about 10 percent of the Magna&#x27;s global workforce at the time. The operations generated sales of $2.4 billion in 2014.

In March 2018, Magna announced they will work together with the ride-share company Lyft to supply high-tech kits that turn vehicles into self-driving cars. The company invested $200 million into the project and both parties will jointly own the intellectual property developed. It was also noted that Magna will be Lyft&#x27;s exclusive supplier of self-driving kits. Magna announced a partnership with BAIC Group in June 2018 to develop &quot;next-generation&quot; smart electric vehicles for Chinese consumers. Walker retired as CEO at the end of 2020, with Swamy Kotagiri replacing him in January 2021.

In February 2021, the office of the governor of the state of Michigan announced that Magna plans to open a facility in the city of St. Clair to build battery enclosures for the 2022 GMC Hummer electric pickup. The battery enclosures will be produced at General Motors&#x27; facility in Detroit and Hamtramck. The new facility is expected to cost $70 million and to create over 300 jobs for the state.
An electric version of the Ineos Grenadier off-road utility vehicle is to be developed by Ineos and Magna, scheduled to enter production in Graz, Austria in 2026.

==Corporate affairs==
Magna International Inc. (full name as certified under the Ontario &quot;Business Corporations Act&quot;) is headquartered in Aurora, Ontario, and has 342 manufacturing operations and 91 product development, engineering and sales centres in 27 countries. Its United States operations are headed out of Troy, Michigan with its European head office in Vienna, Austria. Donald J. Walker was its chief executive officer and was working with Magna since 1987 until 2021.

Magna is governed under a corporate constitution, and requires consensus from management, shareholders and employees to make any changes. The company shares 10 percent of pretax profits with its employees. As of 2019, the company has 158,000 employees.

===Acquisitions===
In 2002, Magna International announced that it had reached an agreement with DaimlerChrysler to acquire its Austrian-based Eurostar Automobilwerk operation.

Magna acquired 80% of New Venture Gear, once a joint venture between General Motors and Chrysler, in September 2004, and combined it into Magna Powertrain. It assumed full ownership in 2007, closing the operation in August 2012.

In October 2004, Magna announced its intention to unwind the legacy public offerings it had made of three divisions that it spun off as standalone companies in past years: Tesma International Inc. (initial public offering (IPO) in 1995), Decoma International Inc. (IPO in 1997) and Intier Automotive Inc. (IPO in 2001). Magna made offers to the boards of the three companies, with an expected total cost to Magna of billion (equivalent to $billion in ) in cash and Magna shares, to privatize the companies within Magna International. The three privatizations were completed in February (Tesma and Decoma) and April (Intier) of 2005.

Magna purchased CTS Fahrzeug-Dachsysteme, a supplier of convertible roofs, from Porsche in November 2005.

In July 2015, Magna bought the German company Getrag, which was one of the largest suppliers of automotive transmissions worldwide for $1.9 billion. The acquisition worked to increase growth potential in the Chinese market.

In 2018, the company acquired Haptronik GmbH, a German motion control software developer, OLSA S.p.A., an Italian automotive lighting manufacturer, and Viza Geca SL, a Spanish automotive seating company. It partnered with Innoviz Technologies to produce solid-state lidar for autonomous vehicles for BMW Group.

Magna acquired Boston startup Optimus Ride and its &gt;120 employees in January 2022.

In December 2022, it was announced Magna has acquired the Stockholm-headquartered Veoneer Active Safety business from SSW Partners for US$1.52 billion.

====Groups====
, Magna International consists of seven groups, which hold further corporate subsidiaries and subdivisions:
* Cosma
* Magna Electronics
* Magna Powertrain
* Magna Exteriors
* Magna Seating
* Magna Steyr
* Mechatronics, Mirrors &amp; Lighting

==Technology==
During its history, Magna International has worked with automakers to advance vehicle safety and technology such as smart mobility seating systems including stow-into-floor minivan seats, exterior systems including reaction injection moulding (RIM) bumpers, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), blind-spot detection and lane departure warning systems. The company is the largest automobile parts supplier in North America and the third largest worldwide.

It uses mobility technology to develop customized computing for fully automated driving systems. In 2018, it introduced an Icon radar system to help automakers reach Level 5 autonomy as well as automatic emergency braking systems. Magna has partnered with BMW on electrification to produce electric cars on a contract basis. The company is also known for using new materials for &quot;lightweighting&quot; vehicles. In 2017 Goldman Sachs has reported that automated features developed by suppliers such as Magna will produce a 42 percent compound annual growth rate in global revenue over the next decade.

<text>Stony Brook Southampton is a campus location of Stony Brook University, located in Southampton, New York, between the Shinnecock Indian Reservation and Shinnecock Hills Golf Club on the eastern end of Long Island.

==History==

===Southampton College, Long Island University===

Southampton College was founded in 1963 by Long Island University (LIU). It had its own station on the Long Island Rail Road until 1998 when the station was dismantled because it was lightly used.

From 1993, Robert F.X. Sillerman served as the Chancellor, replacing Angier Biddle Duke, ambassador to Spain under Lyndon Johnson. Sillerman took the job on two conditions: that the college scrap ill-defined liberal-arts programs and focus on marine science and creative writing, and that he lead publicity. He named Kermit the Frog as the 1996 commencement speaker: 31 newspapers picked up the story, creating a free marketing bonanza that raised the college&#x27;s profile and drew hundreds of new admissions.

Refocusing on the marine science curriculum garnered the campus several accolades, including being named in 1998 as the Cousteau Society&#x27;s sole North American Affiliate. In the course of the campus&#x27; tenure under Long Island University, it produced 34 Fulbright scholars, most of which hailed from the marine science program.

After many years of fiscal mismanagement, the University announced a multimillion-dollar capital campaign, launched a new interdisciplinary CORE curriculum and the construction of a new library to re-vamp the campus. After one year of a 10-year plan however, Long Island University officials ceased all plans, and Long Island University decided to effectively close the campus. This forced most students to either move to the University&#x27;s Nassau County location, C.W. Post Campus or transfer elsewhere.

Although protests and advocacy, including a rally by the non-profit Save The College at Southampton and the student-led organization The Orphans of L.I.U., made numerous headlines with their actions, Undergraduate Programs ceased, and all but a few campus buildings were shuttered by the end of Summer 2005.

When Long Island University announced its plans to close the campus, in 2005 the Shinnecock Indian Nation filed a suit seeking return of including both the campus and the golf club. There were local concerns that either the land would be taken over by the Shinnecocks for a casino, or that the land would be used for a housing development in the Hamptons.

The undergraduate Marine Biology Department was moved to the control of Stony Brook University in Summer 2005, and from Fall 2005, the State University of New York (SUNY) began offering an undergraduate marine sciences program, with teaching and research facilities at the campus leased from LIU.

===Stony Brook Southampton===
On March 24, 2006, SUNY announced a final agreement for the purchase of the Southampton College property from LIU. SUNY paid US $35 million for the campus and its waterfront facility for its famed Marine Biology Department, as well as the NPR-affiliated WLIU FM 88.3 radio station. In the agreement to take over WLIU, it states that the station is to continue its LIU affiliation and move from its broadcasting studios in Chancellors Hall by April 2010 to another location on Hill Street in Southampton. The station has an agreement to have its broadcast tower on the campus through 2024. The Mill Hill I windmill (1814) was moved here in 1890 from Mill Hill at Windmill Lane and Hill Street in Southampton. The Shinnecocks claim the land from Mill Hill to Shinnecock Hills Golf Club as land ceded them by treaty.

In 1957 the playwright Tennessee Williams rented the 3-story windmill cottage and while there wrote &quot;The Day on Which a Man Dies&quot;, a fictional play loosely based on his friend Jackson Pollock. The play languished after completion in 1960 in the college archives and was sold by Williams in 1970 to the University of California, Los Angeles. A new version re-written by the playwright in 1972 was performed in 2001; the first performance of the original in 2009 was presented by the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center at the Ross School in East Hampton.

Under Stony Brook University&#x27;s new ownership and starting with a class of 200 in August 2007, the campus featured an innovative curriculum devoted to issues of sustainability and the environment. Southampton’s interdisciplinary academic programs focused on issues of ecological sustainability, with undergraduate majors in environmental studies; marine sciences; marine vertebrate biology; ecosystems and human impact; environmental design, policy and planning; and sustainability studies. A minor in business management with a focus on environmental sustainability was also offered through Stony Brook University&#x27;s College of Business, and a five-year fast-track BA/BS-MBA program was also offered in partnership with the College of Business.

By the Fall 2010 semester, 800 students were registered. However, in April 2010, Stony Brook University President Samuel Stanley announced his decision to shut down the branch due to major state budget cuts and the need for better targeting of funds. The academic programs and students were relocated to the main campus. The undergraduate population staged letter campaigns to raise community awareness and protest the decision. Stanley came to the Southampton campus shortly after the decision to meet with the student body.

Six undergraduate students and a non-profit community group filed a lawsuit in NY State Supreme Court to block the closure of the college. The lawsuit was filed against Stony Brook and Stanley, claiming the decision to close the campus was procedurally illegal. On August 30, 2010, the court ruled that the university violated regulations and improperly closed the campus. The students won the lawsuit, but unable to contest financially due to the costs associated with instigating further litigation, agreed to a small settlement. They were permitted to complete their studies on campus, but not live there. Stanley visited each student&#x27;s home to personally apologize.

As of 2015, the Stony Brook Southampton campus has grown and even prospered. Programs have been added back and the Board of Trustees of the State University of New York approved a long-awaited partnership agreement between Southampton and Stony Brook University hospitals that will ultimately result in a new Southampton Hospital on the Shinnecock Hills campus, a move that likely will bring the most activity those grounds have ever seen.

==Arts program==

The Stony Brook Southampton Campus is a hub of the MFA program in Creative Writing and Literature through The Lichtenstein Center, undergraduate and graduate marine sciences, and health professions programs. All of the programs at The Lichtenstein Center are defined broadly to foster exploration of artistic expression in fields outside traditional program borders and to promote collaboration between disciplines in the creation of original work.

Interdisciplinary study, small class size, and one-on-one advising form the foundation of The Lichtenstein Center experience, where close student-faculty relationships are a priority. Students are offered practice in teaching, publishing or arts administration to further their real-world knowledge in the industry and also to gain admission to the Southampton Summer Arts Conferences. There are approximately 310 students currently enrolled.

Faculty includes Amy Hempel, Molly Gaudry, Christine Kitano, Marissa Levein, Robert Lopez, Julie Sheehan, Christine Vachon, Alan Kingsberg, Robert Reeves (author), Lou Ann Walker (author), Billy Collins, Emma Walton Hamilton, Matthew Klam, Susan Merrell (author), Genevieve Sly Crane, and L.B. Thompson. 

===Manhattan Track===
Students accepted into the program may earn an MFA degree by combining coursework at the Manhattan facility and the Southampton campus during fall and spring terms, and at the Southampton campus during summer by participating in the prestigious Southampton Writers Conferences.

===Southampton Writing Conference===
Stony Brook Southampton also hosts the prestigious Summer Writing Conferences, which attracts renowned authors from around the world to teach and participate in creative writing workshops, which take place in two sessions throughout July. Remaining hours are devoted to lectures, readings, performances workshops, and panel discussions featuring faculty members and distinguished visiting authors, editors, publishers, and agents. Participants also enjoy a myriad of formal and informal social gatherings—author receptions, an open-mic night, breakfasts, lunches and dinners under the tents, and an issue launch of &quot;The Southampton Review&quot;.

==Young Artists and Writers Project==
The Young Artists and Writers Project (or YAWP, formerly the Young American Writers Project) created by Stony Brook Southampton&#x27;s MFA in Creative Writing and Literature Program, is dedicated to mentoring middle and high school students in the development of creative expression and critical thinking through writing. The YAWP curriculum sends professional writers and writing teachers into Long Island schools with a variety of innovative, inter-disciplinary writing workshops, including playwriting, screenwriting, poetry, personal essay, fiction, and visual arts. YAWP programs are offered throughout the school year and can be custom designed to fit the needs of an individual school. They can be offered in &quot;push-in&quot; format, as enrichment to creative writing, English, theatre or other academic classes, as extra-curricular programs or in retreat format. YAWP programs can be particularly effective for at-risk students, or for those who find writing and communications skills challenging in the traditional academic environment.

==School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences==
The SUNY School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (SoMAS) also operates on the Southampton campus. The primary focus of the SoMAS faculty and students is on fundamental research designed to increase understanding of the processes that characterize the coastal ocean and the atmosphere. The School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences is also committed to researching solutions to problems that result from society&#x27;s interactions with the environment. The Southampton location allows access to a variety of environments for research ranging from the open ocean to the waters of the largest metropolitan area in the United States, as well as the resources at the nearby National Weather Service, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

<text>Shawn Colvin (born Shawna Lee Colvin, January 10, 1956) is an American singer-songwriter. She is best known for her 1997 Grammy Award-winning song &quot;Sunny Came Home&quot;.

==Early life==
Colvin was born Shawna Lee Colvin in Vermillion, South Dakota, and spent her youth in Carbondale, Illinois, and London, Ontario, Canada. She is the second of four children. She learned to play guitar at the age of 10 and grew up listening to her father&#x27;s collection of music, which included artists such as Pete Seeger and the Kingston Trio.

==Career==
Her first paid gig came just after she started college at Southern Illinois University. Colvin performed at local venues in Carbondale and later formed a band. For six months, they expanded their fanbase throughout Illinois. During this time, Colvin struggled with drug and alcohol use. She later formed Dixie Diesels, a country-swing group. Colvin relocated to Austin, Texas, with the group and then entered &quot;the folk circuit in and around Berkeley, California&quot;, before straining her vocal cords and taking a sabbatical at the age of 24.

Colvin relocated to New York City, joining the Buddy Miller Band in 1980 and later became involved in the &quot;Fast Folk&quot; cooperative of Greenwich Village.

While participating in off-Broadway shows such as &quot;Pump Boys and Dinettes&quot;, she was featured in &quot;Fast Folk&quot; magazine, and in 1987, producer Steve Addabbo hired her to sing backup vocals on the song &quot;Luka&quot; by Suzanne Vega.

After touring with Vega, Colvin signed a recording contract with Columbia Records and released her debut album &quot;Steady On&quot; in 1989. The album won a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Colvin&#x27;s second album &quot;Fat City&quot; was released in 1992 and received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Recording. Her song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Why&quot; was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Female Pop Vocal category. In 1993, she moved back to Austin and, in 1994, released the album &quot;Cover Girl&quot;. In 1995, Colvin released her album &quot;Live 88&quot; a collection of live recordings from 1988.

In 1996, Colvin released her album &quot;A Few Small Repairs&quot; and, in 1997, her single &quot;Sunny Came Home&quot; spent four weeks at the number one spot on the Adult Contemporary chart. The song won the 1998 Grammy Awards for both Song and Record of the Year. Colvin released the album &quot;Holiday Songs and Lullabies&quot; in 1998 and in 2001 released another album called &quot;Whole New You&quot;. In 2004, she released a compilation of past songs called, &quot;Polaroids: A Greatest Hits Collection&quot;.

In 2006, Colvin left Columbia Records and released a 15-song album called &quot;These Four Walls&quot; on her new label, Nonesuch Records, which featured contributions by Patty Griffin and Teddy Thompson. In 2009 she released &quot;Live&quot;, which was recorded at the jazz club Yoshi&#x27;s in Oakland, California.

Colvin&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;All Fall Down&quot;, was released in 2012 and was produced by Buddy Miller at his home studio in Nashville, Tennessee. The album featured guest appearances by Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss and Jakob Dylan. Colvin published her memoir &quot;Diamond in the Rough&quot; in 2012. In 2016, she recorded an album with Steve Earle called &quot;Colvin and Earle&quot;. &quot;A Few Small Repairs&quot; was reissued in 2017, including its first pressing on vinyl, for its 20th anniversary.

Colvin has made vocal contributions to songs by James Taylor, Béla Fleck, Edwin McCain, Shawn Mullins, Elliott Murphy and Bruce Hornsby, and collaborated with Sting on the song &quot;One Day She&#x27;ll Love Me&quot;. She recorded as a duet the title track to Curtis Stigers&#x27; 1995 album &quot;Time Was&quot;. Colvin voiced Rachel Jordan, Ned Flanders&#x27; love interest after Maude is killed, in the Simpsons episodes &quot;Alone Again, Natura-Diddily&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Goin&#x27; to Praiseland&quot;, and lent her vocals to Mary Chapin Carpenter&#x27;s 1992 recordings &quot;The Hard Way&quot; and &quot;Come On Come On&quot;.

===Acting===
Colvin has appeared in several films and television shows, including the films &quot;Grace of My Heart&quot;, &quot;Heartbreakers&quot; and &quot;Crazy&quot; as well as television shows &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Fame L.A.&quot;, and &quot;Baywatch&quot;.

==Personal life==
Colvin has been married twice, first to Simon Tassano in 1993 whom she divorced in 1995 and to photographer Mario Erwin, whom she married in 1997 and divorced in 2002. She gave birth to a daughter in July 1998.

Colvin has taken part in several triathlons.

Colvin says she has struggled on and off with depression, alcoholism and anxiety. She wrote about these struggles in her 2012 memoir &quot;Diamond in the Rough&quot;, published by HarperCollins.

He resigned following his defeat in the 1916 Quebec provincial election in the riding of Jacques-Cartier which he was the member for eight years. In 1920 he became a Quebec Superior Court judge.

He became Dean of the law faculty of the University of Montreal and emeritus professor. He was an associate of Batonnier De Sales Bastien, and became President of the Mount Royal Telephone Co. and of the St. Lawrence Tobacco Co., board director of Saraguay Light &amp; Power Co., and member of the Canadian Club and Lafontaine Club of Montreal.

<text>Oren Ethelbirt Long (March 4, 1889 – May 6, 1965) was an American politician who served as the tenth Territorial Governor of Hawaii from 1951 to 1953. A member of the Democratic Party of Hawaii, Long was appointed to the office after the term of Ingram Stainback. After statehood was achieved he served in the United States Senate, one of the first two, along with Hiram Fong, to represent Hawaii in that body. Long was the only non–Asian American U.S. Senator from Hawaii until the appointment of Brian Schatz to the position in 2012.

==Life and career==
Long was born in Altoona, Kansas and attended Johnson Bible College in Knoxville, Tennessee, the University of Michigan, and Columbia University in New York City. He first came to Hawaii in 1917 as a social worker in Hilo. He then held various educational positions in the public school system, eventually serving as a superintendent from 1933 to 1946. He was appointed Governor of the Territory of Hawaii by President of the United States Harry Truman in 1951 and served until 1953. Long served in the Hawaii Territorial Senate from 1956-1959.

On July 28, 1959 he was elected to one of the two Senate seats from the newly formed State of Hawaii, and took office on August 21, 1959. The other Senator elected was Republican Hiram Fong. Long chose not to run for a full six-year term in 1962, and was succeeded by fellow Democrat and then-Rep. Daniel Inouye, in January 1963.

For his entire tenure Long was Hawaii&#x27;s senior Senator; although he took office the same day as Fong, Long had a seniority edge due to being a former Governor.

Long appeared as a contestant on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; shortly after taking office. One of the panelists, Bennett Cerf, recognized him immediately and disqualified himself from the round. After three rounds of questioning, the rest of the panel successfully guessed him to be a senator from Hawaii.

He died in 1965 after suffering an attack of asthmatic bronchitis in Honolulu, Hawaii and was buried in Oahu Cemetery.

Long&#x27;s papers are stored at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa in their Catalog for Archival Materials.

<text>John Motley Morehead III (November 3, 1870 – January 7, 1965) was an American chemist, politician, and diplomat. As a chemist, his work provided much of the foundation for the business of Union Carbide Corporation. The Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation was formed in 1917 from the merger of the former Union Carbide founded in 1898 by Morehead&#x27;s father; and the National Carbon Company founded in 1886. He was a noted philanthropist who made major gifts to his alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He also served as mayor of Rye, New York and United States Ambassador to Sweden.

==Early life==
Morehead came from an illustrious North Carolina family: his father was James Turner Morehead; his grandparents, John Motley Morehead and Ann Eliza Lindsay Morehead, served as Governor and First Lady of North Carolina. His sister, Lily Morehead Mebane, was decorated by the governments of France and Serbia for her relief work after World War I; she later served two terms in the North Carolina state legislature. Direct descendants through the paternal line of James Turner Morehead include W. Harris Nelson and William H.M. Nelson III. Non-lineal descendants include Jean Motley Morehead Larkin and John L. Morehead.

Morehead graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill in 1891 and was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

==Career==
One of his notable early scientific discoveries was the development of an economical process for the manufacture of calcium carbide. He was also an authority on the analysis of gases, having invented a device for the purpose and written a book on the subject.

One of Morehead&#x27;s particular interests was in providing financial assistance to students attending UNC Chapel Hill. To that end he endowed the John Motley Morehead Foundation, which each year awards undergraduate scholarships covering the full cost of attendance at UNC Chapel Hill to applicants chosen through an extensive and competitive screening process. The Morehead-Cain Scholarship is the oldest merit-based scholarship in the United States.

During the First World War, Morehead served as a major in the United States Army; he later became a colonel in the United States Army Reserve. From 1925 to 1930, Morehead served as the mayor of Rye, New York, and also gave money for the establishment of a new city hall; his nomination as minister to Sweden, from which he served from 1930 to 1933, came during his mayoralty.

==Personal life==
Morehead married Genevieve Margaret Birkhoff. A few years after her death, he married Leila Duckworth Houghton. He had no children. He devoted his considerable fortune to philanthropy, especially to the benefit of UNC-Chapel Hill. With a college classmate and fraternity brother, Rufus Lenoir Patterson, he donated the Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower on the campus. He also gave the University the Morehead Planetarium, later renamed the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center.

===Honors and legacy===
He was awarded the North Carolina Award, the highest civilian award bestowed by the U.S. state of North Carolina in the category of Public Service in 1964.

There is a section of Interstate 40 named after him, called the John Motley Morehead III Freeway, that passes through Chapel Hill, North Carolina and most of the eastern end of Orange County.

<text>The 1890 Quebec general election was held on June 17, 1890, to elect members of the 7th Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party Parti national coalition led by Honoré Mercier, was re-elected, defeating the Quebec Conservative Party, led by Louis-Olivier Taillon.

A scandal and charges of corruption cut short Mercier&#x27;s term of office. He was later cleared of all charges, but his political career was ended.

==Redistribution of ridings==
Through the passage of two Acts passed prior to the election, the Assembly was increased from 65 to 73 members through the following changes:

<text>Don Cornell (born Luigi Francisco Varlaro; April 21, 1919 – February 23, 2004) was an American singer.

==Early years==
Born to an Italian family in The Bronx, New York, Cornell attended Roosevelt High School in the Bronx.

==Career==
In his teens he played guitar in a band led by jazz trumpeter Red Nichols. When he was eighteen, he was a vocalist in the Sammy Kaye band. He became a solo act in 1949. Between 1950 and 1962, twelve of his records were certified gold. These included the million-seller &quot;It Isn&#x27;t Fair&quot;, plus &quot;I&#x27;ll Walk Alone&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Yours&quot;, and &quot;Hold My Hand&quot;. He appeared often on television programs hosted by Perry Como, Jackie Gleason, and Arthur Godfrey during the 1950s and 1960s.

When singing at the Beverly Hills Supper Club in Kentucky, he appeared many times on the Ruth Lyons television program and was a substitute host. In 1953, he was on the TV program &quot;Chance of a Lifetime&quot;. He had a radio program on KGO in San Francisco in 1953.

In 1959, Cornell, comedian Martha Raye, and other investors formed The Big Daddy Mining Company. The company planned to mine &quot;a rich gold vein on a hillside near Coarsegold, California&quot;.

Cornell worked as a singer into the 1990s. He and his wife founded the label Iris as a division of MCA to release songs he recorded for Coral and Dot earlier in his career. These albums include &quot;Something to Remember Me By&quot; and &quot;From Italy with Love&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Cornell was named to the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1963. In 1993, he was inducted into the Big Band Hall of Fame.

His 1952 hit &quot;I&quot; was the only single-character pop chart entry until Prince&#x27;s No. 7 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit &quot;7&quot; from 1992 and the only single-letter hit until Xzibit&#x27;s No. 76 Hot 100 hit &quot;X&quot; from 2000. &quot;Hold My Hand&quot; sold over one million copies and topped the UK Singles Chart in 1954. Cornell&#x27;s 1955 hit &quot;Young Abe Lincoln&quot; holds the record for highest debuting pop single (No. 25) to spend only one week on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

==Death==
Cornell died in Aventura, Florida, from emphysema and diabetes at the age of 84.

<doc id="517069" wikidata="Q749039" url="?curid=517069" title="Al Green (politician)">
<text>Alexander N. Green (born September 1, 1947) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the U.S. representative from Texas&#x27;s 9th congressional district. Currently in his 11th term, he has served in Congress since 2005. A member of the Democratic Party, Green served as the justice of the peace of Harris County, Texas from 1977 to 2004. The 9th district includes most of southwestern Houston and part of Fort Bend County, including most of Missouri City. It also includes western portions of Pearland.

==Early life, education, and career==
Green was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He attended Florida A&amp;M University and Tuskegee University. He received a Juris Doctor degree in 1974 from Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University. He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

After law school, Green co-founded the law firm of Green, Wilson, Dewberry, and Fitch. He remained in Houston and lives in the community of Alief.

In 1978, Green was elected justice of the peace in Harris County, Texas. He held this position for 26 years before retiring in 2004.

Green ran for mayor of Houston in 1981, and finished fifth in the Democratic primary.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

=== Elections ===
In 2004, Green entered the Democratic primary for the 9th congressional district. The 9th district had previously been the 25th congressional district and was represented by Democrat Chris Bell. A 2003 Texas redistricting placed Bell&#x27;s seat in jeopardy. Although the redistricted 25th district remained heavily Democratic, it had a significantly larger percentage of blacks and Latinos than the old 25th district, which had been 65% white. The new 9th was 17% white, 37% black and 33% Latino. The redistricting left Bell, who is white, vulnerable to a primary challenge from a black or Latino Democrat. Green won the March 9 primary with 66% of the vote to Bell&#x27;s 31%. He then defeated Republican nominee Annette Molina in the general election.

Green was reelected unopposed in 2006 and faced only a Libertarian opponent in 2008. The 9th district is heavily Democratic, with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+29. It is Houston&#x27;s most Democratic district. Hillary Clinton carried the 9th district in 2016 with 79.3% of the vote, her strongest showing in Texas.

=== Tenure ===
In Congress, Green has focused on issues such as fair housing and fair hiring practices for the poor and minorities.
After the 2012 election, Green held a press conference in Houston at which he emphasized the need for the lame duck Congress to work together to reform the national budget. He also announced a plan for infrastructure investments across the country intended to create jobs and unify the country and improve the economy.

Green has supported the Federal Reserve&#x27;s program of quantitative easing and claims it has led to economic recovery since the financial crisis of 2007–2008.
On May 17, 2017, Green presented articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, citing Trump&#x27;s firing of FBI Director James Comey. Immediately after his speech, he shelved the document without calling for a vote, but continued to call for impeachment. He reintroduced articles of impeachment on July 16, 2019, citing Trump&#x27;s attacks on four Democratic congresswomen of color. As a privileged resolution, the House was required to vote on it. On July 17 the House voted to table the resolution, effectively killing it. The vote was 332–95, with 95 Democrats (40%) voting in favor of the resolution and all Republicans against it.

During the House Financial Services Committee hearing on April 10, 2019, at which the CEOs of all the major banks and investment institutions of the United States were sworn to testify, Green presented several questions that were regarded as controversial. He began by asking why all the executives were white men, then asked whether they hypothetically saw themselves succeeded in the future by men of color or women, repeatedly asking them to raise and lower their hands. Green then asked J. P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon whether the institution he chaired had profited from slavery, to which Dimon responded that it had taken place more than two centuries ago.

On February 6, 2024, he left a hospital for a short moment to vote in a wheelchair against the impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas which prevented the success of the inquiry as the Republican Party assumed that he would not be able to attend.

==Political positions==
Green has expressed strong liberal views on social issues.

Green is pro-choice, and consistently votes against restrictions on abortion. On October 13, 2011, he voted against an amendment to the Affordable Care Act, which prevented insurance programs created by the Act from covering abortions. He has voted against eight other bills proposed in the House that would if enacted prevent the federal government from covering the cost of abortions. He has received a 100% ratings from Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America, while receiving a 0% rating from the National Right to Life Committee.

Green also supports gun control. He spoke out after the Trayvon Martin shooting, asking members of the African-American community to show faith in the justice system and let the courts do their job and convict George Zimmerman. The NRA Political Victory Fund gave him repeated &quot;F&quot; ratings, Gun Owners of America rated him 25%, while the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence gave him a Lifetime Score of 83%.

On budget issues, Green follows his party&#x27;s views. He supported every budget bill proposed during President Obama&#x27;s term. During President Bush&#x27;s term, Green voted against all budget bills that cut government spending and cut taxes. He also voted for Obama&#x27;s bailout of the Auto Industry in 2009. On December 10, 2008, he wrote a statement supporting the auto bailout, saying, &quot;The auto bailout is really about bailing out people, and the people of this country... I think that [how tax dollars are spent] is a legitimate concern for the American people, but I do think, with the proper strings attached, we can bail out the people...who may lose their jobs.&quot;

Green is a member of the Congressional Pakistan Caucus. He is a strong supporter of holding Pakistan as an ally in South Asia. After the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on December 27, 2007, which initially destabilized the country as riots erupted, Green issued a statement condemning the assassination as a &quot;dastardly effort to circumvent the democratic process.&quot; He announced his support of the US&#x27;s continued alliance with Pakistan, and urged Pakistanis to continue their push towards true democracy, &quot;knowing that freedom, justice, and democracy are difficult to achieve.&quot;

On December 6, 2017, Green denounced Trump for &quot;casting contempt on transgender individuals, inciting hate and hostility, and sowing discord among the people of the United States on the basis of gender.&quot; Green is a member of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus. On February 25, 2021, Green gave an impassioned speech on the floor of the House in support of the Equality Act, comparing the use of religion to support homophobia by representatives opposed to the bill to the use of religion to support racist policies, saying, &quot;You used God to enslave my foreparents. You used God to segregate me in schools. You used God to put me in the back of the bus. Have you no shame?&quot;

On October 25, 2023, Green and eight other Democrats (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Andre Carson, Summer Lee, Ilhan Omar, Delia Ramirez, and Rashida Tlaib), along with Republican Thomas Massie, voted against congressional bi-partisan non-binding resolution H. Res. 771 supporting Israel in the wake of the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. The resolution stated that the House of Representatives: &quot;stands with Israel as it defends itself against the barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists&quot; and &quot;reaffirms the United States&#x27; commitment to Israel&#x27;s security&quot;; the resolution passed by an overwhelming 412-10-6 margin.

==Lucinda Daniels controversy==
In 2008, former staffer Lucinda Daniels accused Green of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace, including claims that Green discriminated against Daniels after she refused to continue to have sex with him. Daniels filed a lawsuit against Green and then withdrew it. Green filed a counter-lawsuit, alleging Daniels had threatened to sue Green for workplace discrimination if Green did not pay her money. Green subsequently withdrew his suit too. &quot;The Hill&quot; reported that a spokesman for Green said the two had had a &quot;romantic encounter&quot; in 2007, but that the allegations of sexual harassment were untrue.

In 2017, at a time when several other congressmen were facing accusations of sexual misconduct, Green and Daniels released a joint statement saying that both regretted having &quot;hastily made allegations and charges against one another that have been absolutely resolved&quot; and that they were &quot;friends&quot;.

<text>The 1886 Quebec general election on October 14, 1886, to elect members of the 6th Legislative Assembly for the Province of Quebec, Canada. The &quot;Parti National&quot;, a broad coalition formed and led by Honoré Mercier, that included the &quot;Parti libéral du Québec&quot; and nationalist defectors from the Conservative party. The &quot;Parti national&quot; got a large boost when Liberals and dissident Conservatives rallied in reaction to the hanging of Louis Riel in 1885, for which the federal Conservatives were held responsible by Quebec voters. The nationalists won a majority of seats against the &quot;Parti conservateur du Québec&quot;, led by John Jones Ross.

The Conservatives hung on in a minority government until Mercier became premier on January 27, 1887.

The turnout was 63.96%.

<text>688 Attack Sub is a submarine simulator video game designed by John W. Ratcliff and Paul Grace and published in 1989 for MS-DOS and in 1990 for Amiga by Electronic Arts. A Sega Genesis version developed by MicroProse was released in 1991 by Sega.

The player takes command of a US or Soviet nuclear-powered attack submarine and plays ten missions ranging from into either Cold War scenarios or combat missions in a hypothetical global conflict. As modeled in the game, the American submarine has more sophisticated electronics and more weapons. The Soviet boat has fewer weapons but higher sustained speeds. Two people can play against each other over a modem (or null modem cable).

Ratcliff and Grace later developed &quot;SSN-21 Seawolf&quot;, published in 1994.

==Gameplay==
==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1989 gave the IBM PC compatible version a positive review, noting the game was designed to be a fun game, as opposed to a realistic simulator, and concluding that it was &quot;this reviewer&#x27;s personal candidate for &#x27;Game of the Year&#x27;&quot;. 1992 and 1994 surveys in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game two stars out of five, stating that the game was closer to World War II than modern submarine operations, and criticizing the &quot;unrealistic&quot; emphasis on periscope target acquisition. &quot;Compute!&quot; included the game in its list of &quot;nine great games for 1989&quot;, describing it as &quot;swift and exciting as any Mach 2 flight simulator&quot;. The magazine praised the game&#x27;s graphics and two-player modem option, but criticized the lack of more than ten missions.

Mike Siggins reviewed &quot;688 Attack Sub&quot; for &quot;Games International&quot; magazine, and gave it a rating of 7 out of 10, and wrote that &quot;the appeal of using modern weapons soon wears off and one is left with only the different situations to add spice. Overall though, it is a good game on an unusual topic but would benefit from a second edition&quot;.

<text>The 1878 Quebec general election was held on May 1, 1878 to elect members of the 4th Legislative Assembly for the Province of Quebec, Canada. The result was a hung parliament, with no party having a clear majority. Only one seat divided the two major parties, the Quebec Conservative Party and the Quebec Liberal Party. The balance of power was held by two Independent Conservatives.

The incumbent premier, Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière, was able to form a minority government with the support of the Independent Conservatives, even though the Conservative Party had one seat more than the Liberals.

== Political events ==

The election was called in unusual circumstances. On March 8, 1878, the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, Luc Letellier de Saint-Just, dismissed the Conservative premier, Charles Boucher de Boucherville, in a dispute over proposed railway legislation. The Lieutenant Governor then appointed Joly de Lotbinière, the leader of the Liberals, as premier. Since the Conservatives still maintained a substantial majority in the Legislative Assembly, on March 22, 1878 Joly de Lotbinière requested the dissolution of the Assembly and a general election, which Letellier de Saint-Just ordered.

The election was fought in part over economic issues and in part over the actions of the Lieutenant Governor, who was criticised by the Conservatives for having installed Joly de Lotbinière by a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. One of the leading Conservatives, Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau, opened his campaign with the slogan: &quot;Silence the voice of Spencer Wood [the residence of the Lieutenant Governor] and let the mighty voice of the people speak.&quot; Joly de Lotbinière agreed that the people should decide, and campaigned on the slogan “The province must choose between direct taxation and economy.”

Following the election results, Joly de Lotbinière was able to stay in office for one year as the leader of a minority government supported by the Independent Conservatives, even though the Conservative Party had one more seat than the Liberals. In 1879, he was defeated in the Assembly by the Conservatives, who formed a minority government.

== Electoral map ==

The Legislative Assembly was composed of sixty-five single-member constituencies or &quot;ridings&quot;. The 1878 election was conducted under the pre-Confederation electoral map of the former Province of Canada. That map had set the boundaries for the sixty-five constituencies of Canada East, which became Quebec. The &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot; provided that the pre-Confederation electoral map would continue to be used for Quebec elections until altered by the Legislature of Quebec. The map of the sixty-five constituencies was also to be used in federal elections, until altered by Parliament.

== Conduct of the election ==

=== Secret ballot ===

The election was conducted under &quot;The Quebec Election Act&quot;, a provincial statute. It was the second election where the secret ballot was used in Quebec.

=== Preparation of voter lists ===

The Act required that each municipality prepare a voter list in March of each year, based on the valuation of property and ownership used for the tax rolls. The list was drawn up the secretary-treasurer of each municipality. The municipal council then reviewed the list and could make corrections to it. Once approved by the municipal council, the list was in force until the preparation of the list in the next year. Any person who was dissatisfied by their inclusion or exclusion from the list could appeal to the local judge of the superior court or district magistrate, whose decision on the issue was final.

=== Procedure for the election ===

The election began with a proclamation issued by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, setting the date for nomination of candidates. The date was the same for all constituencies. The provincial Clerk of the Crown in Chancery then issued sixty-five writs, directed to the returning officer for each constituency, directing them to conduct the election. The Returning Officer would be the registrar or sheriff of the constituency.

On the date set for nominations, the Returning Officer would hold a public meeting to receive nominations. The meeting was conducted at the most central and convenient location in the constituency, in a court house, city hall or registry office, between noon and one o&#x27;clock.

To be nominated, a candidate had to file a nomination paper with the Returning Officer, signed by at least twenty-five supporters eligible to vote in the constituency, and accompanied with a deposit of $200. The nomination paper and deposit had to be filed on or before the nomination meeting.

If only one nomination was received, the Returning Officer would declare that person to be elected, and immediately report the result to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery with the return of the writ. If two or more candidates were nominated, voting would occur one week after the nomination date set in the writ. The Returning Officer would establish polling stations throughout the constituency. On polling day, the polls would open in each station and voters would cast their ballots in the locked ballot box. When the polls closed, the deputy returning officers would unlock the ballot box, count the ballots in the presence of the candidates or their agents, and prepare a record of the vote. The deputy returning officer would then place all of the records and ballots in the ballot box, lock it, and deliver the ballot box to the Returning Officer.

Once all the ballot boxes were received, the Returning Officer would open all the ballot boxes in the presence of witnesses and total the votes from each polling station. The Returning Officer would declare the candidate with the most votes elected. If there was a tie between the top two candidates, the Returning Officer was required to give a written casting vote immediately to decide the election. In no other circumstances could the Returning Officer vote.

The Returning Officer would then prepare a complete report of the results of the election, along with his return of the writ, and forward it all to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery.

==Results==

The election resulted in a hung parliament: neither of the parties had a majority. Two Independent Conservatives were elected, who held the balance of power.

<text>The 1875 Quebec general election was held on July 7, 1875, to elect members of the 3rd Legislative Assembly for the Province of Quebec, Canada. The Quebec Conservative Party, led by Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville, defeated the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière.

The election was the first one held under the new &quot;Quebec Elections Act&quot;, passed by the de Boucherville government to replace the pre-Confederation elections law. The new law provided for the secret ballot in Quebec elections for the first time. Under the pre-Confederation elections law, each voter had been required to publicly declare their vote to the elections officials, a form of open ballotting.

== Franchise and qualification ==

=== Right to vote ===

The right to vote in elections to the Legislative Assembly was not universal. Only male British subjects (by birth or naturalisation), aged 21 or older, were eligible to vote, and only if they met a property qualification. For residents of larger cities, the qualification was being the owner or occupant of real property assessed at three hundred dollars or more, or for tenants, an annual rent of thirty dollars or more. For any other municipality, the qualification was being an owner or occupant of real property assessed at two hundred dollars or more, or twenty dollars in annual value. For tenants in smaller centers, the qualification was paying an annual rent of twenty dollars or more.

Women were completely barred from voting.

Judges and many municipal and provincial officials were also barred from voting, particularly officials with law enforcement duties, or duties relating to public revenue. The Returning Officer in each riding was also barred from voting, except when needed to give a casting vote in the event of a tie vote.

=== Qualification for the Legislative Assembly ===

Candidates for election to the Legislative Assembly had to meet stricter qualifications than voters. To stand for election, a candidate had to 
# Be at least twenty-one years of age;
# Be of the male sex;
# Be a subject of Her Majesty (either by birth or naturalisation);
# Be free from all legal incapacity;
# Be the proprietor in possession of lands or tenements worth at least $2,000, over and above all encumbrances and charges on the property.

Women were completely barred from membership in the Assembly.

== Electoral map ==

The Legislative Assembly was composed of sixty-five single-member constituencies or &quot;ridings&quot;. The 1875 election was conducted under the pre-Confederation electoral map of the former Province of Canada. That map had set the boundaries for the sixty-five constituencies of Canada East, which became Quebec. The &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot; provided that the pre-Confederation electoral map would continue to be used for Quebec elections until altered by the Legislature of Quebec. The map of the sixty-five constituencies was also to be used in federal elections, until altered by Parliament.

== Conduct of the election ==

=== New election law ===

The election was the first election conducted under &quot;The Quebec Election Act&quot;, a completely new election law passed by the Quebec Legislature. The new Act replaced the pre-Confederation election law, which had been continued in use for the first two elections, in 1867 and 1871. Two significant changes under the new law were the introduction of the secret ballot, and a requirement that all constituencies vote on the same day.

=== Secret ballot ===

The 1875 election for the Legislative Assembly was the first time the secret ballot was used in Quebec. Under the pre-Confederation law used in the first two general elections, voting had been by open ballotting, where voters publicly declared their vote to the polling officials.

=== Preparation of voter lists ===

The Act required that each municipality prepare a voter list in March of each year, based on the valuation of property and ownership used for the tax rolls. The list was drawn up the secretary-treasurer of each municipality. The municipal council then reviewed the list and could make corrections to it. Once approved by the municipal council, the list was in force until the preparation of the list in the next year.

The provincial Clerk of the Crown in Chancery then issued sixty-five writs, directed to the Returning Officer for each constituency, directing them to conduct the election. The Returning Officer would be the registrar or sheriff of the constituency.

On the date set for nominations, the Returning Officer would hold a public meeting to receive nominations. The meeting was conducted at the most central and convenient location in the constituency, in a court house, city hall or registry office, between noon and one o&#x27;clock.

To be nominated, a candidate had to file a nomination paper with the Returning Officer, signed by at least twenty-five supporters eligible to vote in the constituency, and accompanied with a deposit of $200. The nomination paper and deposit had to be filed on or before the nomination meeting.

If only one nomination was received, the Returning Officer would declare that person to be elected, and immediately report the result to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery with the return of the writ. If two or more candidates were nominated, voting would occur one week after the nomination date set in the writ. The Returning Officer would establish polling stations throughout the constituency. On polling day, the polls would open in each station and voters would cast their ballots in the locked ballot box. When the polls closed, the deputy returning officers would unlock the ballot box, count the ballots in the presence of the candidates or their agents, and prepare a record of the vote. The deputy returning officer would then place all of the records and ballots in the ballot box, lock it, and deliver the ballot box to the Returning Officer.

Once all the ballot boxes were received, the Returning Officer would open all the ballot boxes in the presence of witnesses and total the votes from each polling station. The Returning Officer would declare the candidate with the most votes elected. If there was a tie between the top two candidates, the Returning Officer was required to give a written casting vote immediately to decide the election. In no other circumstances could the Returning Officer vote.

The Returning Officer would then prepare a complete report of the results of the election, along with his return of the writ, and forward it all to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery.

==Results==

The election resulted in a Conservative victory. The Conservatives were maintained in office with a strong majority, although a somewhat reduced seat count. The Liberals held steady with nineteen seats, the same as in the 1871 election.

<text>The 1871 Quebec general election was held in June and July 1871 to elect members of the Second Legislature for the province of Quebec, Canada. The Quebec Conservative Party, led by Premier Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau, was re-elected, defeating the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière.

== Franchise and candidacy ==

=== Right to vote ===

The right to vote in elections to the Legislative Assembly was not universal. Only male British subjects (by birth or naturalisation), aged 21 and older, were eligible to vote, and only if they met a property qualification. For residents of cities and towns, the qualification was being the owner, tenant or occupant of real property assessed at three hundred dollars, or at an assessed yearly value of thirty dollars. For residents of townships and parishes, the requirements were either an assessment of two hundred dollars, or an assessed yearly value of twenty dollars.

Women were expressly prohibited from voting, &quot;for any Electoral Division whatever&quot;.

Judges and many municipal and provincial officials were also barred from voting, particularly officials with duties relating to public revenue. Election officials were also barred from voting.

=== Qualification for the Legislative Assembly ===

Candidates for the Legislative Assembly had to meet a significant property qualification. A candidate had to own real property in the Province of Canada, worth at least £500 in British sterling, over and above any encumbrances on the property.

== Electoral map ==

The Legislative Assembly was composed of sixty-five single-member constituencies or &quot;ridings&quot;. The 1871 election was conducted under the pre-Confederation electoral map of the former Province of Canada. That map had set the boundaries for the sixty-five constituencies of Canada East, which became Quebec. The &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot; provided that the pre-Confederation electoral map would continue to be used for Quebec elections until altered by the Legislature of Quebec. The map of the sixty-five constituencies was also to be used in federal elections, until altered by Parliament.

== Conduct of the election ==

The 1867 election was conducted under the election laws of the Province of Canada, which had been continued until altered by the Legislature of Quebec. The electoral process of the Province of Canada in turn had been based on the traditional British electoral process, without a secret ballot. Instead, elections were public affairs, with each voter publicly stating the name of the candidate they voted for.

The election process began with writs of election issued by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, one for each constituency (also called a &quot;riding&quot;). The writ was directed to the Returning Officer for each constituency and required the Returning Officer to hold a public nomination of candidates, and if necessary a poll, on days to be chosen by the Returning Officer.

On the nomination day, the Returning Officer held a public meeting &quot;in the open air&quot;, at a central place in the constituency, and in a place where the public had access, such as in front of a town hall or church in the constituency. The Returning Officer addressed the assembled members of the public from a platform, called a &quot;husting&quot;, and called for nominations. If only one person was nominated, the Returning Officer would close the nominations and declare that person elected. If more than one person was nominated, the Returning Officer would grant a poll, to be held at a future date, chosen by the Returning Officer.

On polling day, polls would be held across the constituency. The polls were in held in the open air, or in buildings close to the highways, with free access by the public. It was prohibited to hold a poll in a &quot;tavern or place of public entertainment&quot;. The Returning Officer would appoint a Deputy Returning Officer for each polling place, normally the town clerk or other municipal official. Each Deputy Returning Officer would have a poll book. Qualified voters would appear before the Deputy Returning Officer and declare how they voted. The Deputy Returning Officer would record each voter&#x27;s vote in the poll book. At the close of the polls, the Deputy Returning Officers would deliver the poll books to the Returning Officer. The Returning Officer would then total all of the polls in public, at the place where the nominations had occurred, declare which candidate was elected, and issue a proclamation declaring the election closed. The Returning Officer would then send a report of the election with the return of the writ to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, within fifteen days after the closing of the election.

The elections for the sixty-five provincial constituencies were not all conducted on the same day. The writs of election for each constituency gave the Returning Officer the discretion to set the original nomination day, and the subsequent date for the polling, if more than one candidate were nominated. The 1867 election was spread across the months of August and September.

==Results==
The election resulted in a Conservative victory. The Conservatives were maintained in office with a strong majority, although a somewhat reduced seat count. The Liberals improved their standings from twelve seats to nineteen.

<text>The 1867 Quebec general election was held in August and September 1867 to elect members of the First Legislature for the Province of Quebec, Canada. The Quebec Conservative Party, led by Premier Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau, defeated the Quebec Liberal Party led by Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière.

== Creation of Quebec ==

The province of Quebec was created on July 1, 1867, with the proclamation of the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;. That Act united the Province of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into Canada. The Province of Canada was split into two provinces, with Canada East (formerly Lower Canada) becoming the new province of Quebec. The Legislature of Quebec was composed of the Lieutenant Governor, representing the Queen; the elected Legislative Assembly, with sixty-five seats; and the appointed Legislative Council.

Because the old Province of Canada was dissolved on July 1, 1867, the former government ceased to exist, with no formal provisions for the creation of the government of Quebec. The first prime minister of Canada, Sir John A. Macdonald, had planned to have the experienced Quebec politician, Joseph-Édouard Cauchon, appointed as the first premier. However, the proposal met strong opposition from Montreal anglophones, based on Cauchon&#x27;s position on public and religious schools, which was a major political issue at the time. As a compromise candidate, the Quebec Conservatives proposed Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau, who had political experience in the Province of Canada but had been out of electoral politics for twelve years. Chauveau was generally acceptable to Quebec Conservatives, and on July 15, 1867, the Lieutenant Governor appointed him as the first premier of Quebec.

== Franchise and candidacy ==

=== Right to vote ===

The right to vote in elections to the Legislative Assembly was not universal. Only male British subjects (by birth or naturalisation), aged 21 and older, were eligible to vote, and only if they met a property qualification. For residents of cities and towns, the qualification was being the owner, tenant or occupant of real property assessed at three hundred dollars, or at an assessed yearly value of thirty dollars. For residents of townships and parishes, the requirements were either an assessment of two hundred dollars, or an assessed yearly value of twenty dollars.

Women were expressly prohibited from voting, &quot;for any Electoral Division whatever&quot;.

Judges and many municipal and provincial officials were also barred from voting, particularly officials with duties relating to public revenue. Election officials were also barred from voting.

=== Qualification for the Legislative Assembly ===

Candidates for the Legislative Assembly had to meet a significant property qualification. A candidate had to own real property in the Province of Canada, worth at least £500 in British sterling, over and above any encumbrances on the property.

== Party structure ==

Chauveau appointed the first Cabinet, and then called the first general election for Quebec. Chauveau had been a member of the Parti Bleu when he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, and the Bleus were transitioning into the new Conservative party of Quebec. The Bleus had been well-organised under the leadership of George-Étienne Cartier, and the new Conservative party inherited that structure.

On the other hand, the liberals in the new province were not well-organised. The old Parti Rouge had opposed the confederation project, and had tended to split on that issue. Transitioning into the Liberal Party of Quebec, they did not have a strong party structure going into the election. They did not field a complete slate of candidates, and did not even have a leader, as many of their influential leaders had opted for federal politics and were now in Ottawa. Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière was the informal leader of the Liberals, because of his political experience in the former Province of Canada.

== Electoral map ==

The Legislative Assembly was composed of sixty-five single-member constituencies or &quot;ridings&quot;. The 1867 election was conducted under the pre-Confederation electoral map of the former Province of Canada. That map had set the boundaries for the sixty-five constituencies of Canada East, which became Quebec. The &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot; provided that the pre-Confederation electoral map would continue to be used for Quebec elections until altered by the Legislature of Quebec. The map of the sixty-five constituencies was also to be used in federal elections, until altered by Parliament. 

Ths use of strictly single-member districts was a change from the previous election. The 8th Parliament of the Province of Canada had had four districts in Quebec where two members were elected (through Plurality block voting).

== Conduct of the election ==

The 1867 election was conducted under the election laws of the Province of Canada, which had been continued until altered by the Legislature of Quebec. The electoral process of the Province of Canada in turn had been based on the traditional British electoral process, without a secret ballot. Instead, elections were public affairs, with each voter publicly stating the name of the candidate they voted for.

The election process began with writs of election issued by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, one for each constituency (also called a &quot;riding&quot;). The writ was directed to the Returning Officer for each constituency and required the Returning Officer to hold a public nomination of candidates, and if necessary a poll, on days to be chosen by the Returning Officer.

On the nomination day, the Returning Officer held a public meeting &quot;in the open air&quot;, at a central place in the constituency, and in a place where the public had access, such as in front of a town hall or church in the constituency. The Returning Officer addressed the assembled members of the public from a platform, called a &quot;husting&quot;, and called for nominations. If only one person was nominated, the Returning Officer would close the nominations and declare that person elected. If more than one person was nominated, the Returning Officer would grant a poll, to be held at a future date, chosen by the Returning Officer.

On polling day, polls would be held across the constituency. The polls were in held in the open air, or in buildings close to the highways, with free access by the public. It was prohibited to hold a poll in a &quot;tavern or place of public entertainment&quot;. The Returning Officer would appoint a Deputy Returning Officer for each polling place, normally the town clerk or other municipal official. Each Deputy Returning Officer would have a poll book. Qualified voters would appear before the Deputy Returning Officer and declare how they voted. The Deputy Returning Officer would record each voter&#x27;s vote in the poll book. At the close of the polls, the Deputy Returning Officers would deliver the poll books to the Returning Officer. The Returning Officer would then total all of the polls in public, at the place where the nominations had occurred, declare which candidate was elected, and issue a proclamation declaring the election closed. The Returning Officer would then send a report of the election with the return of the writ to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, within fifteen days after the closing of the election.

The elections for the sixty-five provincial constituencies were not all conducted on the same day. The writs of election for each constituency gave the Returning Officer the discretion to set the original nomination day, and the subsequent date for the polling, if more than one candidate were nominated. The 1867 election was spread across the months of August and September.

One unusual event in the 1867 elections was that the constituency of Kamouraska did not return a member. On nomination day, a riot broke out and the Returning Officer had to seek refuge from the rioters. No nominations were received and no polling date was set. Kamouraska did not have a member in the Legislative Assembly until after a by-election was successfully held in 1869.

==Results==

The result of the election was a Conservative victory. The Conservatives were maintained in office with a strong majority. The Liberals won only twelve seats.

Following the election, the Chauveau government appointed the twenty-four members of the Legislative Council. The result was a Council with a very strong Conservative majority.

<text>Sir Louis-Olivier Taillon (; September 26, 1840 – April 25, 1923) was a Canadian lawyer and politician. He was the eighth premier of Quebec, serving two separate terms.

==Political career==
Taillon&#x27;s first term of office was just four days, from January 25 to January 29, 1887. This term came at the end of the Conservative government of his predecessor John Jones Ross. Ross had lost the 1886 Quebec election, but had tried to cling to power in a minority government for a few more months.

Taillon was Leader of the Opposition from 1887 until 1890, when he lost the 1890 election and his own seat.

He briefly returned to the practice of law, but following the removal of Liberal Honoré Mercier from office by the Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec, Taillon became minister without portfolio in the government of Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville. Taillon became premier when Boucher de Boucherville resigned. Taillon lost the 1890 election but continued as leader of the party.

He resigned in 1896 and moved into federal politics to serve as Postmaster-General in the very short-lived federal Conservative government of Charles Tupper, from May to July 1896. He failed to gain a federal seat in the 1896 federal election, and likewise failed to secure a seat in the 1900 federal election, ending his political career. In 1916, he was made a Knight Bachelor.

==Personal life==
Taillon was born in Terrebonne, Lower Canada (now Quebec). He was the son of Aimé Taillon, a farmer, and Josephte Daunais. Taillon married Georgiana Archambault in 1875. Archambault and their child died shortly after the child&#x27;s birth in January 1876.

By the 1920s, Taillon had lost his sight and by 1922 had cut off his beard, his political trademark. Taillon lived in the Institution des Sourdes-Muettes on Rue Saint-Denis in Montreal. Taillon died in 1923.

<doc id="517095" wikidata="Q1898068" url="?curid=517095" title="Reduced-gravity aircraft">
<text>A reduced-gravity aircraft is a type of fixed-wing aircraft that provides brief near-weightless environments for training astronauts, conducting research, and making gravity-free movie shots.

Versions of such airplanes were operated by the NASA Reduced Gravity Research Program, and one is currently operated by the Human Spaceflight and Robotic Exploration Programmes of the European Space Agency. The unofficial nickname &quot;vomit comet&quot; became popular among those who experienced their operation.

== History ==

Parabolic flight as a way of simulating weightlessness was first proposed by the German aerospace engineer Fritz Haber and his brother, physicist Heinz Haber in 1950. Both had been brought to the US after World War II as part of Operation Paperclip. As well, Shih-Chun Wang studied nausea in astronauts for NASA, which helped lead to the creation of the vomit comet.

Parabolic flights are sometimes used to examine the effects of weightlessness on a living organism. While humans are by far the most common passengers, animals have occasionally been involved in experiments, including a notable experiment on how weightlessness affected a domestic cat&#x27;s righting reflex and a pigeon&#x27;s attempts to navigate in a weightless state.

== Operating principles ==
The aircraft gives its occupants the sensation of weightlessness by following a parabolic flight path, which is the path that objects naturally follow while in free fall. The aircraft is used in this way to demonstrate to astronauts what it is like to orbit the Earth. 
During this time the aircraft does not need to exert any ground reaction force on its contents to keep them stationary relative to the aircraft, causing the sensation of weightlessness.

Initially, the aircraft climbs with a pitch angle of about 45 degrees. The sensation of weightlessness is achieved by reducing thrust and lowering the nose to maintain a neutral, or &quot;zero lift&quot;, configuration such that the aircraft follows the same path that an object in free fall, with no air resistance, would follow. Engine thrust is used to exactly compensate for drag. Weightlessness begins at the point when the plane starts to follow this parabolic path, which is while the plane is ascending. It lasts through the rest of the ascent, and into the descent phase, until the aircraft must pull up, usually when it reaches a downward pitch angle of around 30 degrees. The aircraft then pulls back up to repeat the maneuver. During this pull-up, the forces felt are roughly twice that of gravity. This cycle can be repeated.

This aircraft is used to train astronauts in zero-g maneuvers, giving them about 25 seconds of weightlessness out of 65 seconds of flight in each parabola. During such training, the airplane typically flies about 40–60 parabolic manoeuvres. In about two thirds of the passengers, these flights produce nausea due to airsickness, giving the plane its nickname &quot;vomit comet&quot;.

==Operators==

===Canada===
The Canadian Space Agency and the National Research Council have a Falcon 20 used for microgravity research. The small plane is normally not used for people to float freely and experience weightlessness; however, comedian Rick Mercer did so for a segment of his show.

===Ecuador===

The first zero G plane to enter service in Latin America is a T-39 Sabreliner nicknamed &quot;CONDOR&quot;, operated for the Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency and the Ecuadorian Air Force since May 2008. On June 19, 2008, this plane carried a seven-year-old boy, setting the Guinness world record for the youngest person to fly in microgravity.

===Europe===
Since 1984, ESA and the CNES have flown reduced-gravity missions in a variety of aircraft, including NASA&#x27;s KC-135, a Caravelle, an Ilyushin Il-76MDK, and an Airbus A300 known as the &quot;Zero-G&quot;. In 2014 the A300 was phased out in favor of a more modern Airbus A310, also named &quot;Zero-G&quot;. It is based at Bordeaux-Mérignac airport in France, operated by Novespace, and has also been flown from Paris Le Bourget airport and Dübendorf Air Base in Switzerland. Since 1997 CNES subsidiary Novespace has handled the management of these flights.

This aircraft is used also to realize commercial flights for public passengers in partnership between operator Novespace and the company, under Air Zero G brand. The aircraft has also been used for cinema purposes, with Tom Cruise and Annabelle Wallis filming for &quot;The Mummy&quot; in 2017.

===Russia===
In Russia, commercial flights are offered on the Ilyushin Il-76MDK jet; several U.S. companies book flights on these jets.

The Indian Air force also used them to train the first batch of Indian Astronauts for the Gaganyaan Project of ISRO.

===United States===
====NASA====
NASA flew zero gravity flights on various aircraft for many years. In 1959 Project Mercury astronauts trained in a C-131 Samaritan aircraft dubbed the &quot;vomit comet&quot;.

Twin KC-135 Stratotankers were used until December 2004 and later retired. One, a KC-135A registered N930NA (also known as NASA 930, formerly USAF serial no. 59-1481), flew more than 58,000 parabolas after NASA acquired it in 1973, before being retired in 1995. It is now on display at Ellington Field, near the Johnson Space Center. The other (N931NA or NASA 931, formerly AF serial no. 63-7998) was also used by Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment for filming scenes involving weightlessness in the movie &quot;Apollo 13&quot;; it made its final flight on October 29, 2004, and is permanently stored in the Pima Air &amp; Space Museum in Tucson, Arizona.

In 2005 NASA replaced these aircraft with a McDonnell Douglas C-9B Skytrain II (N932NA) formerly owned by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and the United States Navy.

NASA concluded the Reduced Gravity Research Program and ended operations in July 2014, due to aircraft technical problems. It is replaced with private company contracts.

 NASA had a microgravity services contract with Zero Gravity Corporation (ZERO-G) and used its aircraft, G-FORCE ONE, a modified Boeing 727-200.

====Other operators====
In late 2004, the Zero Gravity Corporation became the first company in the United States to offer zero-g flights to the general public, using Boeing 727 jets. Each flight consists of around 15 parabolas, including simulations of the gravity levels of the Moon and Mars, as well as complete weightlessness.

In 2015, Integrated Spaceflight Services, began serving as the research and education integrator of the National Research Council of Canada for the US market, offering comprehensive reduced-gravity services on a modified Falcon 20 aircraft. ISS has flown annual microgravity research campaigns to evaluate space suits and other technologies with Project PoSSUM.

Aurora Aerospace in Oldsmar, Florida offers zero-g flights using a Fuji/Rockwell Commander 700. It is also used to simulate the gravity of the Moon and Mars.

==Airsickness==
According to former Reduced Gravity Research Program director John Yaniec, anxiety contributes most to passengers&#x27; airsickness. The stress on their bodies creates a sense of panic and therefore causes the passenger to vomit. Yaniec gives a rough estimate of passengers, that &quot;one third [become] violently ill, the next third moderately ill, and the final third not at all.&quot; Vomiting is referred to as being &quot;ill&quot;.

Scopolamine is often used as an antiemetic during reduced-gravity-aircraft training.

== Use in media production ==
The 1995 film &quot;Apollo 13&quot; filmed many scenes aboard NASA&#x27;s KC-135 parabolic aircraft.

In 2016, rock group OK Go recorded a music video for their single &quot;Upside Down &amp; Inside Out&quot; on a reduced-gravity aircraft, which involved acrobatic choreography created specifically for the zero-gravity environment.

The adult entertainment production company Private Media Group has filmed a pornographic movie called &quot;The Uranus Experiment: Part Two&quot; where a zero-gravity intercourse scene was filmed aboard a reduced-gravity aircraft. The filming process was particularly difficult from a technical and logistical standpoint. Budget constraints allowed for only one shot, featuring the actors Sylvia Saint and Nick Lang. Berth Milton, Jr, president and CEO of Private Media Group, said in 2000 &quot;You would not want to be afraid of flying, that&#x27;s for sure!&quot;
The ZERO-G corporation was featured in the &quot;MythBusters&quot; NASA Moon Landing Conspiracy episode, in which it flew Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman on a custom flight path to replicate the Moon&#x27;s gravity. This allowed Savage to replicate the footage of Neil Armstrong walking on the Moon, disarming claims that the footage was forged.

<doc id="517096" wikidata="Q346073" url="?curid=517096" title="Steve Moore (ice hockey)">
<text>Steven Francis Moore (born September 22, 1978) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre who played in parts of three National Hockey League (NHL) seasons with the Colorado Avalanche.

Moore is widely known for suffering a career-ending injury as a result of an on-ice altercation by then-Vancouver Canucks forward Todd Bertuzzi on March 8, 2004, as revenge for another incident involving Moore in a prior game between the teams that season. The fall-out from the event has contributed to a growing effort to curb gratuitous violence in hockey, and professional sports in general.

==Playing career ==
Steve Moore was drafted by the Colorado Avalanche in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft in the second round, the 53rd pick overall. He played hockey at Harvard. Moore played in 69 games for the Avalanche from 2001 to 2004, scoring five goals and seven assists, all of which were scored in the later season, before being seriously injured by Todd Bertuzzi who at the time played for the Vancouver Canucks (see below). At the time of the incident, the Avalanche were first overall in the NHL standings, and Moore was playing on the Avalanche&#x27;s top line, on right wing, with linemates Joe Sakic (center), and Paul Kariya (left wing).

=== Bertuzzi incident ===

On February 16, 2004, during a Vancouver-Colorado game, Moore injured Canucks team captain Markus Näslund with a high hit while Näslund was reaching for a puck through centre ice. Moore contacted Näslund&#x27;s head in the play. No penalty was called in connection with the hit, but Näslund suffered a concussion and a bone chip in his elbow as a result, and missed three games. After reviewing tapes of the hit, the NHL ruled that the hit was legal and did not fine or suspend Moore. Canucks head coach Marc Crawford and general manager Brian Burke publicly criticized the non-call by the referees on the incident.

During the next game between the Canucks and Avalanche held in Denver on March 3, 2004, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and NHL executive vice-president Colin Campbell attended the game, which ended in a tie and saw no major incidents break out.

However, on March 8, 2004, during another rematch between the Avalanche and Canucks, things went differently. In the first period, Moore fought Vancouver player Matt Cooke in a fairly even brawl, and served the 5-minute penalty for fighting. The Avalanche would go on to build up a large lead of 8–2 in a fight-filled game. Shortly before the midway mark of the third period, Todd Bertuzzi was sent onto the ice. After failing to instigate Moore to fight, Bertuzzi skated after Moore, pulled him back by the jersey and punched him in the back of the head. Rendered unconscious from the hit and pushed by Bertuzzi&#x27;s weight and momentum, Moore fell head first into the ice. Moore&#x27;s teammate Andrei Nikolishin and Bertuzzi&#x27;s teammate Sean Pronger then piled on to Moore and Bertuzzi. Moore lay motionless for ten minutes before being carried off on a stretcher. The combination of the hit, fall, and piling-on had resulted in three fractured cervical vertebrae fractures, facial cuts, and a concussion.

Bertuzzi was assessed a match penalty for his actions, which carries an automatic indefinite suspension under NHL rules. On March 11, 2004, the NHL announced Bertuzzi would remain suspended for at least the remainder of the Canucks&#x27; season, including any playoff games. The IIHF subsequently honoured the NHL suspension, preventing Bertuzzi from playing in any international tournaments or leagues during the 2004–05 NHL lockout, effectively leaving Bertuzzi professionally inactive for the entirety of the lockout season.

On August 22, 2004, Moore was released from a Denver-area hospital. He wore a neck brace for one year and then started physical therapy for his neck injury and concussion.

On February 17, 2005, Moore filed a civil lawsuit against Bertuzzi. Also named were Brad May (who was quoted as saying that there would &quot;definitely be a bounty on Moore&#x27;s head&quot; after the game), Brian Burke and the Canucks organization. The lawsuit was thrown out in October 2005, with the judge suggesting that the lawsuit be re-filed in Canada, where the incident took place. The lawsuit was re-filed in Canada, in February 2006.
On August 8, 2005, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced that Bertuzzi would be allowed to play again at the start of the 2005–06 NHL season. In the league&#x27;s decision, they cited many reasons for ending the suspension, such as: 
*Bertuzzi serving a suspension of 20 games, which at the time tied for 4th longest in NHL history (13 regular season games, 7 playoff games)
*Bertuzzi&#x27;s forfeited salary ($501,926.39 USD)
*Significant uncertainty, anxiety, stress and emotional pain caused to Bertuzzi&#x27;s family
*The commissioner&#x27;s belief that Bertuzzi was genuinely remorseful and apologetic for his actions

On August 12, 2005, Brian Burke, formerly Vancouver&#x27;s general manager who was now serving in the same capacity with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, had made an offer to Moore. It was a two-way contract that would have paid Moore $475,000 US in the NHL and $75,000 if the player suited up for Portland, the Ducks&#x27; American Hockey League affiliate. Moore&#x27;s lawyer Tim Danson described the offer as a self-serving attempt by Burke (who was a defendant in the lawsuit) to mitigate potential legal damages, by attempting to suggest Moore was a minor league player. Further, Danson said that Moore would return to the Avalanche except that Moore was not medically cleared to play hockey, which Brian Burke was well aware of, and described it as adding insult to injury.

On August 15, 2005, Bertuzzi broke his 17-month-long silence by expressing a desire to move on with his life. &quot;I&#x27;m sure just like Steve Moore and his family, it&#x27;s been difficult for both parties. I know I wish that day never happened. It&#x27;s been some tough times, but I&#x27;ve got good family and good friends and good peers in the league that have helped me get over the hump and move forward and come through it.&quot;

On November 8, 2005, Moore&#x27;s Toronto-based lawyer, Tim Danson, said that Moore was skating and doing regular workouts, but continued to suffer concussion-related symptoms. He continued working out for some years afterward, but had to abandon his comeback attempt when it became apparent he would never be medically cleared to return to the ice again.

In July 2012, former Avalanche enforcer Scott Parker, who had been a teammate of Moore&#x27;s very briefly the season prior to the Bertuzzi incident in 2004, made some controversial comments. In an interview with milehighhockey.com, Parker was quoted as saying &quot;he (Moore) went to Harvard, you know what, blow me. College grad. I never went to college, but I can kick your ass. I&#x27;ll bring you right down to my IQ level if you want. I&#x27;ll hit you about four times in the skull, that&#x27;ll bring you right down.&quot;

====Civil lawsuit====

On February 16, 2006, Moore filed a civil suit in the province of Ontario against Bertuzzi, the Canucks, and the parent company of the Canucks, &quot;Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment&quot; for the loss of his NHL career, in his Rookie Year. The lawsuit was seeking $15 million in pecuniary damages for loss of income, $1 million for aggravated damages, and $2 million for punitive damages. Moore&#x27;s lawyer filed the suit one day before its two-year limitation expired, saying it was because Steve Moore did not want to file the suit and waited until the last minute while he tried to attain medical clearance to resume his career.

Bettman attempted to get Bertuzzi and Moore to agree on an out-of-court settlement in the lawsuit filed by Moore. Bertuzzi offered $350,000 to settle the case, an amount which was called &quot;an insult&quot; by Moore&#x27;s lawyer.

On March 28, 2008, Bertuzzi filed a lawsuit against Crawford, alleging that he was contractually obliged to obey Crawford and that therefore Crawford shares responsibility for the injury to Moore. In response, Crawford later stated that Bertuzzi acted in &quot;direct disobedience&quot; to orders from the bench to get off the ice before attacking Moore. On January 14, 2013, The Toronto Star reported that both Moore v. Bertuzzi, et al. and Bertuzzi v. Crawford would begin, after having been postponed several times, in April 2013. Both cases will be held in the Ontario Superior Court before a six-person jury.

On January 4, 2012, Bertuzzi dropped his third-party lawsuit against Crawford. In the month of October 2013, it was announced that the court date for Moore v. Bertuzzi, et al. will begin on September 8, 2014. On July 2, 2014, Moore&#x27;s lawsuit was amended, seeking $68 million in damages, up from $38 million. On August 19, 2014, it was announced that an out-of-court settlement had been reached in Steve Moore&#x27;s lawsuit. Terms of the settlement are confidential.

==Personal ==
Steve Moore&#x27;s older brother Mark, and younger brother, Dominic, all played four years at Harvard University. Because of their relative closeness in age, all three were able to play in the same year for Harvard during the 1999–2000 season. Dominic also went on to play in the NHL.

<doc id="517098" wikidata="Q718349" url="?curid=517098" title="Charles Boucher de Boucherville">
<text>Sir Charles-Eugène-Napoléon Boucher de Boucherville (May 4, 1822 – September 10, 1915) was a Canadian politician and medical doctor. He twice served as the premier of Quebec.

==Personal life==
Boucher was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Descended from Pierre Boucher, he was one of the three children of Pierre Boucher de Boucherville (1780–1857), Seigneur of Boucherville, and Marguerite-Émilie de Bleury (1786–1812), sister of Clément-Charles Sabrevois de Bleury. Boucher de Boucherville took his MD from McGill University, graduating with an MD in 1843.

==Political career==

During the Chauveau administration, he served as Speaker of the Legislative Council. He became premier in 1874 when his predecessor, Gédéon Ouimet, had to resign due to a financial scandal. He then won the 1875 Quebec election but was removed from office on March 8, 1878, in a conflict with Lieutenant Governor Luc Letellier de Saint-Just. Letellier de Saint-Just refused to approve legislation that had been passed by both houses of the Quebec legislature that would have forced municipalities to pay for railway construction. The Lieutenant-Governor deposed Boucher de Boucherville, and called on the Leader of the Opposition, Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière, to form a government.

Boucher de Boucherville&#x27;s second term came about after Honoré Mercier was removed from office by Lieutenant Governor Auguste-Réal Angers on December 16, 1891, on charges of corruption. Mercier was later cleared.

After Conservative leader Louis-Olivier Taillon had lost the 1890 election and his own seat, Jean Blanchet had taken over as Leader of the Opposition to the Mercier government. Blanchet, however, had resigned on September 19, 1891, to accept an appointment as a judge. The Lieutenant Governor, therefore, needed a Conservative to fill the post of Premier and turned to Boucher de Boucherville.

Boucher de Boucherville served for one year but resigned when former Conservative premier Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau was appointed Lieutenant-Governor in December 1892. Relations between the two may have been strained. By 1915 the oldest legislator in North America, he died that year in Montreal at the Deaf and Dumb Institute, in whose work he was so interested that he lived there.
