<text>Lake Mai-Ndombe (, ) is a large freshwater lake in Mai-Ndombe province in western Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
The lake is within the Tumba-Ngiri-Maindombe area, the largest Wetland of International Importance recognized by the Ramsar Convention in the world.

==Location==
The lake drains to the south through the Fimi River into the Kwah and Congo Rivers. Known until 1972 as Lake Leopold II (French: &quot;Lac Léopold II&quot;; Dutch: &quot;Leopold II-meer&quot;) after Leopold II, King of the Belgians. &quot;Mai-Ndombe&quot; means &quot;black water&quot; in Kikongo. The lake is of irregular shape and ranges in depth from only 5 meters (mean) to 10 meters (maximum). Covering approximately 890 square miles (2,300 square km), it is known to double or triple in size during the rainy season. Its waters are oxygenated throughout their depth and the pH ranges from 4.2 to 5.5. Low, forested shores surround it with dense, humid equatorial rainforest prevailing to the north and a mosaic of forest and savanna to the south.

==Biodiversity==
Surveys have revealed a high biodiversity in and around the lake, with animals such as two species of otters, marsh mongoose, giant otter shrew, numerous waterbirds, crocodiles and turtles.

Mai-Ndombe contains acidic, humic-rich blackwater and in general the fish of this lake have been poorly documented, even compared to other regions in the Congo River basin. Although ecologically similar to Lake Tumba and occasionally directly connected by channels or swamps, there are some significant differences in the fish fauna that inhabits the two lakes, but also many shared species. Initial surveys were performed by George Albert Boulenger more than a century ago and there have been relatively few later studies of the fish fauna in the lake. For example, the first study of its northern part was only conducted in 2002. More than 30 fish species are known, but the actual figure is presumed to be considerably higher. There are five known endemics: the catfish &quot;Amphilius opisthophthalmus&quot; and the cichlid &quot;Hemichromis cerasogaster&quot; were scientifically described by Boulenger. The remaining are relatively recent discoveries that only were described in the last few decades: In 1984, a new species of cichlid, &quot;Nanochromis transvestitus&quot;, named for the fact that it exhibits reverse sexual dichromatism, was scientifically described from the lake. In 2006, another new species of cichlid, &quot;Nanochromis wickleri&quot;, was described, and in 2008, a new catfish species, &quot;Chrysichthys praecox&quot;, was documented.

==Economic activity==

Some of the main concession areas of the logging company Sodefor are to the north and south of Lake Mai-Ndombe. On 28 November 2009, two logging barges sank causing the loss of 73 lives. The boat was not authorised to carry passengers, but was believed to have some 270 people on board at the time.

Lake Mai-Ndombe and the river system is often used for transportation across the country because the land based road system is inadequate. Many passenger ferries carry hundreds of people each day. Many of these boats are old and not maintained. On Saturday, May 25, 2019, a passenger ferry with over 350 passengers sank in high winds. Over 45 passengers were confirmed dead in the first day and over hundred deemed still missing. In response the government said it would ban wooden passenger boats over 5 years old from traversing the lake.

<text>Lake Bangweulu (&#x27;where the water sky meets the sky&#x27;) is a freshwater lake in northern Zambia. Bangweulu is one of the world&#x27;s great wetland systems, comprising Lake Bangweulu, the Bangweulu Wetlands and the Bangweulu flats or floodplain. Situated in the upper Congo River basin in Zambia, the Bangweulu system covers an almost completely flat area roughly the size of Connecticut or East Anglia, at an elevation of 1,140 m straddling Zambia&#x27;s Luapula Province and Northern Province. It is crucial to the economy and biodiversity of northern Zambia, and to the birdlife of a much larger region, and faces environmental stress and conservation issues.

With a long axis of 75 km and a width of up to 40 km, Lake Bangweulu&#x27;s permanent open water surface is about 3,000 km2, which expands when its swamps and floodplains are in flood at the end of the rainy season in May. The combined area of the lake and wetlands reaches 15,000 km2. The lake has an average depth of only 4 m, and a maximum depth of 10 m.

The Bangweulu system is fed by about seventeen rivers of which the Chambeshi (the source of the Congo River) is the largest, and is drained by the Luapula River.

==History==

=== European exploration ===
The lake was known to Europeans from reports by chiefs such as Kazembe and from Swahili traders, and it was sometimes referred to as &#x27;Lake Bemba&#x27; from the name of the dominant tribe. In 1868 explorer and missionary David Livingstone was the first European to see the lake at the north end of the Lake Chifunabuli section. He was taken by canoe as far as Mbabala Island. His last expedition a few years later foundered in the swamps and their maze of shifting channels as he struggled to discover the rivers draining in and out of the lake. He died in 1873 in Chief Chitambo&#x27;s village on the edge of the southern flood plain, about 100 km from the lake itself. The spot is marked by the Livingstone Memorial (see map). The lake was partially surveyed in 1883 by the French traveller, Victor Giraud, and first circumnavigated by Poulett Weatherley in 1896.It was a desire for the riches of Bangweulu&#x27;s fisheries and game-rich floodplain which motivated King Leopold II of Belgium to insist, in border negotiations between his Congo Free State and the British in Northern Rhodesia, on a land corridor reaching Bangweulu from Katanga. This resulted in the shape of the Congo Pedicle &quot;(34)&quot; which, as it turned out, does not penetrate the area enough to be of the desired value.

The first Christian missions in Bangweulu were founded in the early 1900s under the authority of Bishop Joseph Dupont of the Catholic White Fathers who was based north of Kasama.

==Human settlement==
The area of the lake is inhabited by the Bisa in Chilubi and Mpika, the Bemba in Luwingu, the Unga in Lunga, the Kabende in Samfya, the Ngumbo in Lubwe, the BenaMukulu in Chungu and affiliated tribes who all speak Chibemba. The Bemba heartland of Paramount Chief Chitimukulu lies to the north-east, around Kasama.
===Fishery===
The lake supports a seasonal fishing industry and the population may increase markedly during the season. In 1989 the average annual catch was estimated at 11,900 tonnes, caught by 10,300 people using 5305 dugout canoes, 114 plank and fibreglass boats, and only 54 outboard motors. In 2000 the catch was 13,500 t.

===Natural gas pipeline===
In early 2004 a private European natural gas company finished preliminary plans to lay a pipeline which would cut directly through the Southeast portion of the Lake. Part of this plan was a proposed dam to allow for partial drainage of the required part of the lake. This plan was met with harsh opposition from the local people as well as environmental activists. After much court-wrangling and lengthy hearings on the project, the plan was disposed of by the European company as they built a detour for their pipeline in the surrounding province.

===Towns and districts===
The largest town, Samfya lies on the south western shore and is the principal base for road and boat transport and tourism, as well as being the administrative centre for Samfya District covering about three-quarters of the lake and swamps. Chilubi District covers most of the rest, its boma is on Chilubi Island &quot;(6)&quot;, which is bordered by the swamps to the east. Luwingu District just touches the lake at Nsombo, which is the principal town at the northern end of the lake. Mpika and Kasama districts just touch the eastern and southern margins of the floodplain, and Serenje District and the Congo Pedicle just reach the southern margin of the floodplain.
==Sections of Lake Bangweulu==
:&quot;Numbers in round brackets like so — (12) — refer to locations on the satellite image&quot;.
A notable feature of the Bangweulu system is a series of parallel sandy ridges running south-west to north-east. These are particularly striking in satellite photographs and are easily seen along the north-western shore, the Lifunge Peninsula &quot;(2)&quot;, Mbalala Island &quot;(3)&quot;, Chilubi Island &quot;(6)&quot;, and the Kapata Peninsula &quot;(10)&quot;. They divide the lake into three sections parallel to its main axis. One divides off a section called Lake Chifunabuli &quot;(1)&quot;, 50 km long but only 5 km wide. Its entrance through a gap in the sand spits (at the end of Lifunge Peninsula) is only 250 m wide. Another sandy ridge, Mbabala Island, divides off a section called Lake Walilupe &quot;(4)&quot;, 30 km long by 13 km wide. The main, middle section of the lake between Ifunge and Mbabala is known only as Bangweulu.

There are numerous bays, inlets, smaller lakes and lagoons around Lake Bangweulu, connected by open water, narrow channels or swamps. The largest is Lake Kampolombo &quot;(9)&quot;, 30 km by 5 km, south of Lake Walilupe and connected to it by a 7 km channel. The 32 km long Kapata Peninsula lies between Lake Kampolombo and the swamps; at its tip on the eastern side is the 15 km long Lake Kangwena &quot;(11)&quot;.

Only the western side of the lake and some of the islands have a well defined shore, with sandy beaches in places especially around Samfya, though even there, some of the bays and inlets are swampy.

It was found that infection with Schistosoma haematobium on the western shores of Lake Bangweulu, Zambia, is higher than previously reported.

==The Bangweulu Swamps==
The Bangweulu Swamps, larger than the lake, extend from the north-west clockwise around to the south. The main part covers an area of roughly 120 km by 75 km and they are normally not less than 9,000 km2.

The swamps act as a check on annual flooding downstream in the Luapula by releasing water slowly through many lagoons and channels. They help prevent the Luapula valley being flooded excessively in the rainy season.

===Rivers and channels through the swamps===
The Bangweulu swamps are fed mainly from the north-east by the Chambeshi River, and drain to the south into the Luapula River. The lake is connected to these rivers, and they to each other, by a complex mass of channels through the swamps that may become choked by vegetation and change their course; there is no easy navigation between them. Floating beds of papyrus may close up the channels to a width allowing only dugout canoes to pass. Motorised vessels are hampered by their width as well as by vegetation clogging propellers. Since colonial times attempts have been made to improve navigation and alter drainage patterns by cutting channels through the swamp. In 1942, attempts were made, with limited success, to cut an outlet from Lake Walilupe to the Luapula&#x27;s exit from the swamps, to allow motor boats to transport cassava and other produce from the northern area of the lake to Kapalala Ferry on the Luapula and from there to the Copperbelt.

===Lagoons===

There are numerous lagoons in the swamps, the more prominent ones are: &quot;Lake Chali (12)&quot; in the south-west, &quot;Lake Chaya (13)&quot; in the east at the mouth of the Lulingilla River in the east, &quot;Lake Wumba (14)&quot; in the north-east at the confluence of the Chambeshi and Luansenshi &quot;(20)&quot; Rivers, and the &quot;Pook Lagoon (15)&quot; in the East near Nsalushi Island &quot;(25)&quot;.

===Other features of the swamps===

On the northern side there are several wide swampy estuaries where rivers enter the lake or swamps, going from north-west to north-east they are: Lupososhi Estuary &quot;(16)&quot;, Luena Estuary &quot;(17)&quot;, Lukuto Estuary &quot;(18)&quot;, Chambeshi Estuary &quot;(19)&quot; (and Luansenshi Estuary which feeds into it).

On the eastern and south-eastern sides the swamps are fed by the Munikashi, Luitikila, Lumbatwa, Lukulu and Lulimala rivers. The estuaries of the last three are the main dry season grazing grounds of the Black Lechwe.

In the main part of the swamps, just south of Chilubi Island, is a large area which is very shallow in the flood season and may become fairly dry at the end of the dry season, called the Lunga Bank &quot;(27)&quot;.

===Floodplains===

Large grassy floodplains with an area of about 3,000 km2 lie mainly south of the swamps, but also in the north-north-east, acting as an extension of the region in the wet season. The southern floodplains are famous for large herds of the near-endemic black lechwe. Further information on wildlife of the wetlands is found on the Bangweulu Wetlands page.

===Water parameters===

Water temperatures at the surface of the Bangweulu system ranged from 25.8 to 28.3 °C in November 1993 and from 23.7 to 27.1 °C in February 1994. The conductivity of the Bangweulu system is unusually low and varies between 20 and 40 μS/cm. Transparency of the water ranges from 0.35 to 0.60 m in most water bodies of the system, but in the Tuchingo lagoon the transparency is much larger (&gt;1.70 m) allowing the bottom to be seen.
== Islands ==
There are numerous inhabited islands in the Bangweulu system.

On the lake they are:
* &quot;Chilubi Island (6)&quot;, the largest, partly in the lake and mainly in the swamps
* &quot;Mbabala Island (3)&quot;, a sand spit dividing off the Lake Walilupe section 
* &quot;Chishi Island (5)&quot;, in the middle of the northern part of the lake
* &quot;Lifunge Mwenzi Island (7)&quot;, dividing off the northern part of Lake Chifunabuli
* Small Islands: &quot;Chindo&quot; and &quot;Ibula Islands&quot; near the north-west shore, and &quot;Chibwe Ngombe Island&quot;, a tiny sliver north-west of &quot;Chilubi Island&quot;, Minswa Island and Ngwishi Island
In the swamps:
* &quot;Nsumbu Island (8)&quot; east of Chilubi Island
* In the eastern swamps: &quot;Chisale Island&quot;, &quot;Panyo Island (24)&quot;, &quot;Nsalushi Island (25)&quot;, &quot;Nsumpa Island&quot;, &quot;Matongo Island&quot; and &quot;Kabulu Island&quot;
*Near the Chambeshi River where it enters the eastern swamps: &quot;Mutwamina Island&quot; and &quot;Munyanga Island&quot; 
*In the southern swamps: &quot;Ncheta Island (26)&quot; (with the village of &quot;Bwalya Mponda&quot;), and &quot;Mbo&quot;, east of the Luapula&#x27;s exit from the swamps
*&quot;Kasoma&quot; village [the seat of the new Lunga District] on the south-east edge of the Lunga Bank
*&quot;Kalimakonde&quot; village on the banks of the Churchill Channel
Flood season islands: on the edge of the swamps, connected to the mainland in the dry season:
*In the north-east: &quot;Kasansa Island (23)&quot;, &quot;Chichile Island (22)&quot;, &quot;Luangwa Island&quot;, &quot;Mbishi Island&quot;, and &quot;Munkanta&quot; at the edge of Lake Chaya, where the Lulingila River enters the eastern swamps.
* In the south: &quot;Kasenga (28)&quot;, close to the outlet of Lake Kangwena, &quot;Kataba (29)&quot;, and &quot;Yongolo&quot;, and &quot;Itulo&quot; at the edge of south-east swamps.

=== Other settlements ===
*&quot;Lubwe (30)&quot; on Lake Chifunabuli has a Catholic mission and hospital
* &quot;Kasaba (31)&quot;, a Catholic mission in the north-west
* &quot;Santa Maria&quot;, a mission on Chilubi Island 
* &quot;Mpanta&quot;, east of Samfya on the channel draining out of Lake Walilupe
*&quot;Twingi (32)&quot;, with a mission, at the south end of the Kapata Peninsula

<text>Siberian Yupiks, or Yuits (), are a Yupik people who reside along the coast of the Chukchi Peninsula in the far northeast of the Russian Federation and on St. Lawrence Island in Alaska. They speak Central Siberian Yupik (also known as Yuit), a Yupik language of the Eskimo–Aleut family of languages.

They are also known as Siberian or [[Eskimo]] (). The name Yuit (юит, plural: юиты) was officially assigned to them in 1931, at the brief time of the campaign of support of Indigenous cultures in the Soviet Union. Their self-designation is Yupighyt (йупигыт) meaning &quot;true people&quot;.

Sirenik Eskimos also live in that area, but their extinct language, Sireniki Eskimo, shows many peculiarities among Eskimo languages and is mutually unintelligible with the neighboring Siberian Yupik languages.

== Material culture ==

=== Traditional crafts ===
The Siberian Yupik on St. Lawrence Island live in the villages of Savoonga and Gambell, and are widely known for their skillful carvings of walrus ivory and whale bone, as well as the baleen of bowhead whales. These even include some &quot;moving sculptures&quot; with complicated pulleys animating scenes such as walrus hunting or traditional dances.

=== Dwelling ===

The winter building of Chaplino Eskimos (Ungazighmiit) was a round, dome-shaped building. It is called &quot;yaranga&quot; in the literature, the same word referring also to the similar building of the Chukchi. In the language of Chaplino Eskimos, its name was . There was a smaller cabin inside it at its back part, the , used for sleeping and living. It was separated from the outer, cooler parts of the yaranga with haired reindeer skins and grass, supported by a cage-like framework. But the household works were done in the room of the yaranga in front of this inner building, and also many household utensils were kept there. In winter storms, and at night also the dogs were there. This room for economical purposes was called .

Other types of buildings among Chaplino Eskimos include a modernized type, and that was used for summer.

== Spiritual culture ==

=== Shamanism ===
Many Indigenous Siberian cultures had persons working as mediator (between human and beings of the belief system, among others) — usually termed as &quot;shamans&quot; in the literature. As Eskimo cultures were far from homogeneous (although had some similarities), thus also shamanism among Eskimo peoples had many variants.

Siberian Yupiks had shamans as well. Compared to the variants found among Eskimo groups of America, shamanism among Siberian Yupiks stressed more the importance of maintaining good relationship with sea animals. Ungazighmiit people (the largest of Siberian Yupik variants) had s, who received presents for the shamanizing, healing. This payment had a special name, — in their language, there were many words for the different kinds of presents and payments and this was one of them. (The many kinds of presents and the words designating them were related to the culture: fests, marriage etc.; or made such fine distinctions like &quot;thing, given to someone who has none&quot;, &quot;thing, given, not begged for&quot;, &quot;thing, given to someone as to anybody else&quot;, &quot;thing, given for exchange&quot; etc.).

==== Fighting the spirit of smallpox ====

The Even people, a tribe that lived on the far eastern side of Russia, believed that the spirit of smallpox could be seen as a Russian woman with red hair. A local shaman would be there to greet migrating reindeer herders (who sometimes brought the disease with them). If the shaman saw the spirit of the disease in the caravan, several shaman worked together to fight it off with a seance. Others in the tribe helped with this ritual.

Tradition says that the smallpox spirit changed from a woman to a red bull when she was attacked. The spirit of smallpox was supposed to be very powerful, and if the shaman&#x27;s ritual failed, all the local people would die. The spirit would only spare two people to bury all the rest. But if the ritual worked, the spirit would be forced to leave.

=== Name giving ===
Similarly to several other Indigenous cultures, the name-giving of a newborn baby among Siberian Yupik meant that a deceased person was affected, a certain rebirth was believed. Even before the birth of the baby, careful investigations took place: dreams, events were analyzed. After the birth, the baby&#x27;s physical traits were compared to those of the deceased person. The name was important: if the baby died, it was thought that he/she has not given the &quot;right&quot; name. In case of sickness, it was hoped that giving additional names could result in healing.

=== Amulets ===
Amulets could be manifested in many forms, and could protect the person wearing them or the entire family, and there were also hunting amulets. Some examples:
* a head of raven hanging on the entrance of the house, functioning as a familiar amulet;
* figures carved out of stone in shape of walrus head or dog head, worn as individual amulets;
* hunting amulets were attached to something or worn. About the effigy of orca on the tools of the marine hunter, see the beliefs concerning this peculiar marine mammal below.

=== Concepts regarding the animal world ===
The orca, wolf, raven, spider, whale, were revered animals. Also folklore (e.g. tale) examples demonstrate this. For example, a spider saves the life of a girl. The motif of spider as a benevolent personage, saving people from peril with its cobweb, lifting them up to the sky in danger, is present also in many tales of Sireniki Eskimos (as mentioned, their exact classification inside Eskimo peoples is not settled yet).

It was thought that the prey of the marine hunt could return to the sea and become a complete animal again. That is why they did not break the bones, only cut them at the joints.

==== Orca and wolf ====
In the tales and beliefs of this people, wolf and orca are thought to be identical: orca can become a wolf or vice versa. In winter, they appear in the form of wolf, in summer, in the form of orca. Orca was believed to help people in hunting on the sea — thus the boat represented the image of this animal, and the orca&#x27;s wooden representation hang also from the hunter&#x27;s belt. Also small sacrifices could be given to orcas: tobacco was thrown into the sea for them, because they were thought to help the sea hunter in driving walrus. It was believed that the orca was a help of the hunters even if it was in the guise of wolf: this wolf was thought to force the reindeer to allow itself to be killed by the hunters.

==== Whale ====
It is thought that during the hunt only those people who have been selected by the spirit of the sea could kill the whale. The hunter has to please the killed whale: it must be treated as a guest. Just like a polite host does not leave a recently arrived dear guest alone, thus similarly, the killed whale should not be left alone by the host (i.e. by the hunter who has killed it). Like a guest, it should not get hurt or feel sad. It must be entertained (e.g. by drum music, good foods). On the next whale migration (whales migrate twice a year, in spring to the north and in the autumn back), the previously killed whale is sent off back to the sea in the course of a farewell ritual. If the killed whale was pleased to (during its being a guest for a half year), then it can be hoped that it will return later, too: thus, also the future whale hunts will succeed.

=== Celestial concepts ===
In a tale, the sky seems to be imagined arching as a vault. Celestial bodies form holes in it: beyond this vault, there is an especially light space.

<doc id="511845" wikidata="Q454621" url="?curid=511845" title="Rise of Nations">
<text>Rise of Nations is a real-time strategy video game developed by Big Huge Games and published by Microsoft Game Studios in May 2003. Designed as a fusion of concepts from turn-based strategy games with the real-time strategy genre, the game&#x27;s development was led by Brian Reynolds, who founded Big Huge Games following his involvement in the development of the turn-based strategy games &quot;Civilization II&quot; and &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri&quot;. In contrast to previous historical real-time strategy games, &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; is based on the entirety of history, taking place from the ancient era to the modern age , and features eighteen civilizations, playable across eight ages of world history. The game features several innovations on the real-time strategy genre, introducing novel features such as territory and attrition influenced by the turn-based strategy And 4X genre.

&quot;Rise of Nations&quot; received positive reception upon release, with praise directed to its novel features in the genre and broader scope of gameplay. Several contemporary and retrospective publications have nominated the game in lists of the best strategy games of the year and of all time.

An expansion titled &quot;Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots&quot;, was released in 2004, featuring additional monuments, nations, governments, and campaigns. A spin-off title with a fantasy theme, &quot;Rise of Legends&quot;, was released in 2006. Big Huge Games was acquired by 38 Studios in 2009, who sold the rights to &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; to Microsoft following their closure in 2012. &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; was published by Microsoft as a digital re-release as &quot;Rise of Nations: Extended Edition&quot; by developer SkyBox Labs in 2014 for Steam and 2017 for Microsoft Store.

== Gameplay ==

The core of &quot;Rise of Nations&quot;&#x27;s gameplay centers around the concept of &quot;territory&quot;. The area near the player&#x27;s settlements is considered their territory, and players may only construct buildings within their territory or that of an ally (with the exception of the Lakota). A nation&#x27;s borders can be expanded by the creation and expansion of cities and forts, a technology tree, and obtaining access to certain rare resources. Other technologies and resources cause enemy units within a nation&#x27;s borders to suffer attrition over time, which can eventually destroy an unsupplied invasion force.

People in &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; gather resources, or build or repair damaged buildings. All of the six resource types in &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; are infinite in supply.

Any of the game&#x27;s nations can be played during any age, regardless of that nation&#x27;s fate throughout actual history. Each of the 18 civilizations in &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; has 4 to 8 unique units. Some unique units are based on units that those nations would have, if they were not destroyed in real-life. For example, the Native American nations (the Aztecs, Maya, and Inca) have unique units in the Modern and Information ages which resemble real-world Iberian-South American guerrillas. There are 4 end conditions: capture, territorial superiority, wonder victory, or score victory.

Gameplay focuses heavily on creating a balance between offense, defense, and economy. Generalship is also needed in this game like most RTS games; this includes a knowledge of the troops and what they are good at fighting. For example, pikemen are better than cannon at killing cavalry. Terrain plays a major part in this game and knowing the terrain is an important asset in battle. Generals can also be created from a fort to aid an army.

Five tactical formations are also available, including the ability to compress or expand the line of battle. When a formation is chosen, the selected units automatically reposition themselves accordingly, typically with faster moving units in the front and slower moving, vulnerable units in the rear.

In a manner similar to chess, slight strategic mistakes early in the game can turn into major tactical problems later on. For example, if a player starts with the nomad setting where no city is built at the start, it is wise to scout for an area that has resources before building a city, for without resources there is no army and the player will lose.

A single-player campaign, &quot;Conquer the World&quot;, is included in the game. It is comparable to the board game &quot;Risk&quot;, except that attacks are resolved with a real-time battle, which can last as long as 90 minutes depending upon the scenario. The player can also purchase reinforcements or bonus cards and engage in diplomacy with other nations. Bonus cards and reinforcement cards must be deployed from the Map screen. If the Player attacks a Nation&#x27;s capital from the Map screen and wins, all of the territory belonging to that Nation come under the control of the Player and that Nation is eliminated. The campaign starts at the Ancient Age and progresses slowly over the course over the campaign to end at the Information Age (present day). During a battle it may be possible to advance to the next available age and upgrade units for the battle.

&quot;Rise of Nations&quot; uses an Elo rating system to rank players.

=== Units ===
There are more than 100 different units in &quot;Rise of Nations&quot;, ranging from the Ancient Age Hoplite to the Information Age Stealth Bomber. Military units are created at certain structures: the Barracks, Stable/Auto Plant, Siege Factory/Factory, Dock/Shipyard/Anchorage, Airbase, Missile silo, and Fort/Castle/Fortress/Redoubt.

Most Infantry units operate in squads of three, and when a player builds an infantry unit, three soldiers are produced, rather than just one soldier. Exceptions to this rule are: Scout and Special Forces units, armed civilians, flamethrowers, and machine gunners.

Unit types, such as Light Infantry, Heavy Infantry, and Ranged Cavalry, can be upgraded as the player advances through the ages. These upgrades usually represent revolutionary changes in their particular field. For example, the Arquebusier of the Gunpowder Age becomes the Musketeer of the Enlightenment Age, representing the great advantage of flintlock muskets over the earlier matchlock muskets and showing increased attack power and reload speed. Also, each nation gets its own set of unique units. For example, the Greeks can build Companion cavalry; the Russians can build Red Guards infantry and T-80 tanks; the British can build Longbowmen, Highlanders, and Avro Lancaster Bombers; and the Germans get the Tiger and Leopard tanks. In the &quot;Thrones and Patriots&quot; expansion pack, the Americans can build various Marine units.

Because of the wide variety of units in the game, players have the opportunity to create an army customized to their tastes. Most units have a cost that is roughly equal to that of their peers. Additionally, most units use only two resource types, making the creation of diverse armies easier and almost required. Terraced costs further contribute to the incentive for a diverse army, as each additional unit a player creates of a single type will cost slightly more than the last.

=== Wonders ===
Wonders are important buildings in the game. They are real-life structures ranging from the Colossus and the Pyramids to the Supercollider and Space Program. They provide various benefits such as improving resource gathering or making units cheaper. Building wonders can also allow a player to win the game if &#x27;wonder victory&#x27; is chosen as a custom setting of the game, as each wonder is worth a preset number of &quot;Wonder Points&quot;. Wonders can be built starting in the Classical Age. The only exception is the Egyptians, who can make wonders an age earlier. As you progress in the game the wonders become more expensive, but generate more points. For example, the Supercollider is worth eight times as much as the Pyramids in terms of Wonder Points.

=== Multiplayer ===
GameSpy originally used to host the game but currently does not host the game on their servers. The LAN networking, implemented on both platforms, provides a system for people on the same network to play together. There is also a Direct-IP option, allowing non-networked players to connect without the use of GameSpy. Cross-platform play is not supported between Windows and Mac users.

The game is currently available on Steam which makes multiplayer games simple to create.

== Development and release ==

&quot;Rise of Nations&quot; was developed by Big Huge Games, a studio founded by lead developer Brian Reynolds in April 2000. Reynolds and other key development staff had previously worked with Sid Meier under MicroProse and Firaxis Games, developing turn-based strategy games including those in the &quot;Civilization&quot; series. Designer Doug Kaufman stated that the decision of Reynolds to lead an independent project was the belief that turn-based strategy games were &quot;on the decline&quot; and the resistance from Firaxis Games to support a proposal to explore real-time gameplay elements in the &quot;Civilization&quot; series. &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; was developed by a team of twenty-five full staff and several additional contractors, with the core team largely composed of the former developers from MicroProse and Firaxis Games.

In August 2000, Big Huge Games secured a publishing deal with Microsoft to develop multiple titles. The game was announced as the flagship project of Big Huge Games and showcased at the Microsoft International Games Festival at Las Vegas in February 2002. Previews of &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; were also shown by Microsoft at several events, including Gen Con in August 2002, and E3 in May 2003. Microsoft released a public beta of &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; in February 2003 with a competition to receive one of 1,000 beta copies of the game. In March 2003, Microsoft announced a minor delay of the game from the originally planned release date of April 22 to May 20 to allow the development team to refine the game. The gold master of &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; was finalised in April 2003, and released on May 20 for North America and May 23 for Europe.

=== Design ===

The development process for &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; involved considerable use of &quot;prototyping and iteration&quot; to introduce novel features to the real-time strategy format. Lead developer Brian Reynolds stated that the game was developed by brainstorming &quot;ten random ideas&quot; of &quot;cool things to do in a real-time game...those things that didn&#x27;t work we took out, and some of them worked really well.&quot; Reynolds stated that the inclusion of attrition, national borders, and city capture were features adopted from the turn-based strategy game genre. One idea abandoned in early development, the inclusion of different models of government, later became a core component of the &quot;Thrones and Patriots&quot; expansion. In other areas, prototyping led to refining and &quot;radical scaling back&quot; aspects of gameplay that were not working, including a complex technology tree, described by Reynolds as &quot;a disaster&quot; and &quot;totally unworkable&quot;, simplifying the design of technology to be &quot;more distinct&quot; and &quot;exclusive&quot;.

&quot;Rise of Nations&quot; was developed with the core design objective of ensuring that rounds of the game could be played within a short timeframe. Brian Reynolds stated that Microsoft required Big Huge Games to demonstrate the &quot;feasibility&quot; of the game&#x27;s progression, as &quot;no-one could imagine very well that you could do a history game of all of history and not have it take six hours to play. To this end, they even had software milestones to achieve along the way to prove (the game) could play within an hour.&quot; Reynolds stated that some of the key challenges of implementing this pacing were &quot;developing enough different types of artwork&quot; between eras, and creating balanced gameplay across the large amount of unit types in the game, acknowledging &quot;we erred in making aircraft and the offensive units in general too powerful&quot;.

The &#x27;Conquer the World&#x27; campaign of &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; formed a major undertaking in the development process, taking over six months to integrate in the game. Designer and scenario editor Ike Ellis stated that the developers abandoned an original plan to involve a chain of linear single player scenarios, stating the idea was &quot;too boring&quot; and that the game lacked &quot;graphic scale small enough to make it work around individual characters&quot;. Ellis stated that the design of the mode was heavily influenced by the board game &quot;Diplomacy&quot;, with the use of supply centers forming the foundation of the mode. Producer Tim Train stated that combat in &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; was developed with an &quot;epic&quot; and &quot;more strategic&quot; scope, and determined the preference in gameplay design towards &quot;directing armies and troops&quot; and away from &quot;a smaller focus with only a few units on the screen&quot; and the inclusion of special units and abilities.

=== Audio ===

The soundtrack of &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; was composed by Duane Decker, who had previously worked on sound for the &quot;MechWarrior&quot; series of games. Decker described the soundtrack as a &quot;combination of world music with unique cinematic music styles&quot;, featuring &quot;some very expressive performances on rare, ethnic
instruments and mixes in modern elements.&quot; Decker&#x27;s composition process involved considerable research of &quot;unfamiliar&quot; world music styles, stating &quot;I listened to everything from Irish whistle, to Russian balalaika, to Tuvan throat singers&quot;, and was composed as a combination of sampled and live instruments. A DVD of the soundtrack, containing a Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 surround sound stereo mix of the game opening cinematics, and production interviews, was released on June 24, 2003. The soundtrack was released by Sumthing Else, the company of musician and executive producer, Nile Rodgers, who had expressed interest in releasing soundtracks of Microsoft titles. The soundtrack is unique as the first video game soundtrack to be released on the DVD format in surround sound.

== Reception ==

=== Sales ===

&quot;Rise of Nations&quot; and its expansion pack &quot;Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots&quot; have received combined sales of over 1 million copies. In the United States, &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; sold 420,000 copies and earned $15.9 million by August 2006, after its release in May 2003. It was the country&#x27;s 35th best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. Combined sales of all &quot;Rise of Nations&quot;-related games released between January 2000 and August 2006 had reached 700,000 units in the United States by the latter date.

=== Critical reviews ===

&quot;Rise of Nations&quot; received a unanimously positive reception from critics, with review aggregation website Metacritic stating the game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; at an average score of 89%. Many critics praised the innovative design of the game for its fusion of real-time strategy game with turn-based strategy features. Writing for &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, Rob Fahey praised the game as an &quot;innovative and massively enjoyable strategy title that incorporates many of the best elements of two well-loved genres...and this combination has yielded one of the most accessible, playable and deep strategy games of all time.&quot; Elliott Chin of &quot;GameSpot&quot; stated the &quot;two distinct styles of strategy have come together in the form of a truly excellent game&quot;, stating &quot;what really sets &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; apart are all the new concepts it introduces..(making) the game deeper and in many ways more enjoyable than any other real-time strategy game to date.&quot; &quot;PC Gamer&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Rise of Nations&quot; genuinely pushes the genre forward by introducing, and then perfectly using, some very cool gameplay mechanics such as the impact of national borders, attrition, alliances, and how cities are captured.&quot;

The &#x27;Conquer the World&#x27; mode of &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; received particular attention. Writing for &quot;GameSpy&quot;, William Abner stated that the mode was &quot;an absolute blast...it&#x27;s a great minigame that an infinite amount of replay value for the solo gamer. It helps make &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; a complete game.&quot; Rob Fahey of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; stated the mode was &quot;an excellent substitute for a linear campaign mode, although we&#x27;re a little disappointed at how simple the turn-based boardgame play is.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; stated that the mode was a &quot;great twist on the usual story mode&quot;, but critiqued the &quot;deja vu&quot; and &quot;lack of variety&quot; after successive rounds in this mode. Elliott Chin of &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the mode as &quot;enjoyable, if a bit simple, (as) it adds a substantial single-player component to the game,&quot; whilst noting that &quot;this campaign, which is really just a glorified version of &quot;Risk&quot;, isn&#x27;t as developed as the actual real-time game.&quot;

Reviewers were also mixed on the ease of use of combat mechanics of the game. Whilst &quot;IGN&quot; praised the &quot;extremely good interface&quot;, &quot;commonsense approach to grouping units&quot; and &quot;automation applied to non-military units&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot; noted that &quot;things can become pretty unwieldy in massive battles&quot;, describing multiplayer battles as a &quot;nearly mindless clickfest.&quot; Di Luo of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; observed combat to feature too many &quot;overwhelming&quot; mechanics, stating &quot;throw in attrition, supply, spies and commandos into the mix, and you&#x27;ll probably need four hands and eight eyes to manage everything properly at normal speed settings.&quot; Rob Fahey of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; noted the game&#x27;s speed &quot;makes it a little too tricky to pull off tactical moves, with frantic mouse clicking required in combat to get your units to perform flanking manoeuvres and the like.&quot;

Some critics of the game noted that &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; lacked depth in its variety of ages and nations due to the broad scope of the game. &quot;GameSpy&quot; remarked that the game was &quot;bloated with features, options and units.&quot; &quot;Game Informer&quot; critiqued the variation of abilities across nations, stating &quot;such a varied array of nationalities is a beautiful thing, but not all nations are created equal. Some have excellent bonuses incorporated with them, and others are decidedly ho-hum.&quot; Similarly &quot;IGN&quot; stated &quot;yes, there are many races available, but none of them have a personality as such...(they) look the same, since they only employ three different graphic sets...so the racial distinctions feel abstract, rather than part of an immersive experience.&quot; However, John Dewhurst for &quot;PC PowerPlay&quot; noted that &quot;harsh critics could label its diversity too light to be truly immersive and they may have a point. However, for once, a game trying to do too many things is its greatest asset.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; the best computer game of May 2003.

&quot;Rise of Nations&quot; won &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s 2003 &quot;Best Real-Time Strategy Game&quot; award, and was a runner-up in the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Game of 2003&quot; category, which went to &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;. The publication&#x27;s William Harms called it &quot;a blueprint for the genre&#x27;s future&quot; and &quot;how RTS games should be made from here on out&quot;. &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; named &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; the fifth-best computer game of 2003, and presented it with an award for &quot;Best Interface&quot;. The editors wrote that the game &quot;succeeds in a big way, and is about as addictive as they come.&quot; The editors of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; nominated &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; for their 2003 &quot;Strategy Game of the Year&quot; award, but it lost to &quot;Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic&quot;.

During the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; for four awards: &quot;Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Computer Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Computer Strategy Game of the Year&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Innovation in Computer Gaming&quot;.

=== Retrospective reception ===

&quot;Rise of Nations&quot; has received a favorable retrospective reception. Several publications cited the game as one of the best strategy games of all time, including &quot;PC Gamer&quot;, who praised the game&#x27;s &quot;smartly-introduced elements from turn-based strategy games like &quot;Civilization&quot;, and &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot;, praising it as a &quot;complex and rewarding game&quot; and &quot;the closest thing to a real-time take on &quot;Civilization&quot; that we&#x27;ve seen&quot;, and &quot;PC PowerPlay&quot;, who praised the game as &quot;cohesive and elegant&quot;, stating &quot;the real accomplishment is that it manages to make a flowing tech tree from (the) Stone Age to (the) Information Age and keeps the action pumping the whole time.&quot;

The game was included in the 2010 book &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;, with contributor Alec Meer praising the game for the &quot;speed, focus, and its tightness&quot; of its gameplay, stating &quot;the key is that it takes the core model of turn-based strategy games...then implants it at the warlike heart of a real-time strategy game.&quot; Also writing for &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot;, Nate Crowley stated &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; was an underappreciated game that &quot;just hasn&#x27;t stuck around in the collective understanding of the RTS pantheon, praising the game as &quot;well-balanced, diverse in its offering of civ-specific perks, and a superb choice for fast-paced, messy multiplayer games.&quot;

== Legacy ==

In a postmortem of the game in 2003, Brian Reynolds discussed that the developer was &quot;extremely happy with how &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; turned out&quot;, highlighting the game&#x27;s development team and design approach, and the level of support from publisher Microsoft. Reynolds stated that the failure to identify a &quot;clear idea of the kind of game we were making&quot; in the first year of development, and difficulty with the design of linear scenarios leading to the decision to design the &quot;Conquer The World&quot; mode, were major lessons learned in the development period for the game. In a retrospective for &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot; in 2007, Reynolds stated he was &quot;hugely proud of&quot; the game, linking the game&#x27;s commercial success to its innovations on the &quot;merging of two genres&quot;, whilst noting the game featured some minor disappointments, including the &quot;cool but half-way polished&quot; city capture system, and the potential to have developed &quot;better graphics&quot; for the game.

&quot;Rise of Nations&quot; was influential to the development of &quot;Age of Empires 4&quot;. Executive producer Shannon Loftis stated that as the game was influential as a &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to the &quot;Age of Empires&quot; franchise, and lessons learned from its development assisted in setting expectations for the content of &quot;Age of Empires 4&quot;.

== Expansions and sequels ==
=== &quot;Thrones and Patriots&quot; ===
On April 28, 2004, Big Huge Games released the expansion pack &quot;Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots&quot;. The game includes several additional nations, units, wonders, and campaigns, and new features, including the selection of governments that influence gameplay mechanics. In October 2004, a &quot;Gold Edition&quot; of the game was released for Windows and Macintosh, combining the original game with the &quot;Thrones and Patriots&quot; expansion.

=== &quot;Rise of Legends&quot; ===
In May 2006, Big Huge Games released &quot;Rise of Nations: Rise of Legends&quot;, a fantasy-themed spin-off with similar gameplay.

=== &quot;Extended Edition&quot; ===
&quot;Rise of Nations: Extended Edition&quot; was an enhanced re-release of the main game and its expansion released by SkyBox Labs for Steam on June 12, 2014, and for the Windows 10 Store on September 14, 2017, including Xbox Live achievements and cross-play with the Steam version. Graphical changes to the game included updated textures, lighting and water. Other changes to the game included Steamworks integration, adding cloud saves, Steam Trading Cards, achievements, Twitch integration and multiplayer with Elo ranked matches to the game.

=== Cancelled sequels ===
Following release, Microsoft cancelled its deal with Big Huge Games to produce successive &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; titles, including plans to develop &quot;Rise of Nations 2&quot;. In addition, 38 Studios developed an unreleased &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; game, titled &quot;Rise of Nations: Tactics&quot;, following their acquisition of Big Huge Games in 2009. &quot;Tactics&quot; was a completed but unreleased title, discovered following the examination of 38 Studios servers by liquidators prior to auction of the company&#x27;s assets. Developer Stuart Jeff, who worked on &quot;Tactics&quot; for the studio, described the game was a mobile turn-based strategy game for iOS inspired by &quot;Advance Wars&quot; with multiplayer and social networking features, but left the studio before the game was complete. Development was later led by Andy Johnson, who stated the game needed &quot;three months of proper development time&quot; for the game to launch at the time 38 Studios ceased operations in 2012. Assets and intellectual property for the &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; games were sold to an unknown buyer in December 2013.

<doc id="511846" wikidata="Q125912" url="?curid=511846" title="Lake Kivu">
<text>Lake Kivu is one of the African Great Lakes. It lies on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, and is in the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East African Rift. Lake Kivu empties into the Ruzizi River, which flows southwards into Lake Tanganyika. In 1894, German officer and colonial ruler Gustav Adolf von Götzen was the first recorded European to visit the lake.
In the past, Lake Kivu drained toward the north, contributing to the White Nile. About 13,000 to 9,000 years ago, volcanic activity blocked Lake Kivu&#x27;s outlet to the watershed of the Nile.
The volcanism produced mountains, including the Virungas, which rose between Lake Kivu and Lake Edward, to the north. Water from Lake Kivu was then forced south down the Ruzizi. This, in turn, raised the level of Lake Tanganyika, which overflowed down the Lukuga River.

Lake Kivu is one of three lakes in the world, along with Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun, that undergo limnic eruptions (where overturn of deepwater stratified layers releases dissolved carbon dioxide ()). The lake&#x27;s bottom also contains methane (), meaning if a limnic eruption occurs, the lives of the two million people living nearby would be in danger.

==Geography==
Lake Kivu is approximately long and at its widest. Its irregular shape makes measuring its precise surface area difficult; it has been estimated to cover a total surface area of some , making it Africa&#x27;s eighth largest lake. The surface of the lake sits at a height of above sea level. This lake has a chance of suffering a limnic eruption every 1000 years. The lake has a maximum depth of and a mean depth of , making it the world&#x27;s twentieth deepest lake by maximum depth, and the thirteenth deepest by mean depth.

Some or 58 percent of the lake&#x27;s waters lie within DRC borders.

The lake bed sits upon a rift valley that is slowly being pulled apart, causing volcanic activity in the area.

The world&#x27;s tenth-largest island in a lake, Idjwi, lies in Lake Kivu. Settlements on the lake&#x27;s shore include Bukavu, Kabare, Kalehe, Sake and Goma in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Gisenyi, Kibuye, and Cyangugu in Rwanda.

==Chemistry==
Lake Kivu is a fresh water lake and, along with Cameroonian Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun, is one of three that are known to undergo limnic eruptions (where overturn of deepwater stratified layers releases dissolved carbon dioxide). Around the lake, geologists found evidence of massive local extinctions about every thousand years, presumably caused by outgassing events. The trigger for lake overturns in Lake Kivu is unknown, but volcanic activity and changes in climate are both suspected. The gaseous chemical composition of exploding lakes is unique to each lake. In Lake Kivu&#x27;s case, it includes methane () and carbon dioxide (), as a result of lake water interaction with volcanic hot springs.

The amount of methane contained at the bottom of the lake is estimated to be . If burned in a modern combined-cycle generating plant, that amount of methane would generate around 40,000 megawatts for an entire year, which is equivalent to the power output of six Grand Coulee Dams operating at peak springtime power. The lake also holds an estimated of carbon dioxide which, if released in an eruption event, could suffocate all of the inhabitants of the lakeshore. The water temperature is , and the pH is about 7 in the anoxic region, and around 9 in the oxygenated waters. The methane is reported to be produced by microbial reduction of the volcanic . A future overturn and gas release from the deep waters of Lake Kivu would result in catastrophe, dwarfing the historically documented lake overturns at the much smaller Lakes Nyos and Monoun. The lives of the approximately two million people who live in the lake basin area would be threatened.

Cores from the Bukavu Bay area of the lake reveal that the bottom has layered deposits of the rare mineral monohydrocalcite interlaid with diatoms, on top of sapropelic sediments with high pyrite content. These are found at three different intervals. The sapropelic layers are believed to be related to hydrothermal discharge and the diatoms to a bloom which reduced the carbon dioxide levels low enough to precipitate monohydrocalcite.

Scientists hypothesize that sufficient volcanic interaction with the lake&#x27;s bottom water that has high gas concentrations would heat water, force the methane out of the water, spark a methane explosion, and trigger a nearly simultaneous release of carbon dioxide, though the entry of 1 million cubic meters of lava during the January 2002 eruption had no effect. The carbon dioxide would then suffocate large numbers of people in the lake basin as the gases roll off the lake surface. It is also possible that the lake could spawn lake tsunamis as gas explodes out of it.

The risk posed by Lake Kivu began to be understood during the analysis of more recent events at Lake Nyos. Lake Kivu&#x27;s methane was originally thought to be merely a cheap natural resource for export, and for the generation of cheap power. Once the mechanisms that caused lake overturns began to be understood, so did awareness of the risk the lake posed to the local population.

An experimental vent pipe was installed at Lake Nyos in 2001 to remove gas from the deep water, but such a solution for the much larger Lake Kivu would be considerably more expensive. The approximately of carbon dioxide in the lake is a little under 2 percent of the amount released annually by human fossil fuel burning. Therefore, the process of releasing it could potentially have costs beyond simply building and operating the system.

This problem associated with the prevalence of methane is that of mazuku, the Swahili term &quot;evil wind&quot; for the outgassing of methane and carbon dioxide that kills people and animals, and can even kill vegetation when in high enough concentration.

===Methane extraction===
Lake Kivu has recently been found to contain approximately of dissolved biogas at a depth of . Until 2004, extraction of the gas was done on a small scale, with the extracted gas being used to run boilers at the Bralirwa brewery in Gisenyi. As far as large-scale exploitation of this resource is concerned, the Rwandan government has negotiated with a number of parties to extract methane from the lake.

In 2011 ContourGlobal, a UK-based energy company focused on emerging markets, secured project financing to initiate a large-scale methane extraction project. The project is run through a local Rwandan entity called KivuWatt, using an offshore barge platform to extract, separate, and clean the gasses obtained from the lake bed before pumping purified methane via an underwater pipeline to onshore gas engines. Stage one of the project, powering three &quot;gensets&quot; along the lake shore and supplying 26 MW of electricity to the local grid, has been completed. The next phase aims to deploy nine additional gensets at 75 MW to create a total capacity of 101 MW.

In addition, Symbion Power Lake Kivu Limited was awarded a Concession and Power Producing Agreement (PPA) in 2015, to produce 50 MW of power using Lake Kivu methane. The project was expected to commence construction in 2019, with first power (Phase 1 - 14 MW) to be produced in first quarter 2020. The plant was planned to be fully operational in 2021.

Symbion Power has purchased another concession for a further 25 MW and are currently negotiating a PPA with the Rwanda Electricity Group which may see 8 MW of power dispatched to the Grid six months after the PPA has been signed. This concession is on the site of the original pilot plant known as KP1.

In addition to managing gas extraction, KivuWatt will also manage the electrical generation plants and on-sell the electrical power to the Rwandan government under the terms of a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). This allows KivuWatt to control a vertically integrated energy offering from point of extraction to point of sale into the local grid. Extraction is said to be cost-effective and relatively simple because once the gas-rich water is pumped up, the dissolved gases (primarily carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and methane) begin to bubble out as the water pressure gets lower. This project is expected to increase Rwanda&#x27;s energy generation capability by as much as 20 times, and will enable Rwanda to sell electricity to neighbouring African countries. The firm was awarded the 2011 Africa Power deal of the year for innovation in the financing arrangements it obtained from various sources for the KivuWatt project. The $200 million power plant was operating at 26 MW in 2016.

==Biology and fisheries==

The fish fauna in Lake Kivu is relatively poor with 28 described species, including four introduced species. The natives are the Lake Rukwa minnow (&quot;Raiamas moorii&quot;), four species of barb (ripon barbel, &quot;Barbus altianalis&quot;, East African red-finned barb, &quot;Enteromius apleurogramma&quot;, redspot barb, &quot;E. kerstenii&quot; and Pellegrin&#x27;s barb, &quot;E. pellegrini&quot;), an &quot;Amphilius&quot; catfish, two &quot;Clarias&quot; catfish (&quot;C. liocephalus&quot; and &quot;C. gariepinus&quot;), Nile tilapia (&quot;Oreochromis niloticus&quot;) and 15 endemic &quot;Haplochromis&quot; cichlids. Another possibly undescribed species of cichlids are known from the lake. The introduced species are three cichlids, the longfin tilapia (&quot;Oreochromis macrochir&quot;), blue-spotted tilapia (&quot;O. leucostictus&quot;) and redbreast tilapia (&quot;Coptodon rendalli&quot;), and a clupeid, the Lake Tanganyika sardine (&quot;Limnothrissa miodon&quot;) The sardine is referred to locally as &#x27;Ndagala&#x27; or &#x27;Isambaza&#x27;.

The exploitable stock of the Lake Tanganyika sardine was estimated at per year. It was introduced to Lake Kivu in late 1959 by the Belgian agronomist Alphonse Collart. An attempt to introduce the similar Lake Tanganyika sprat (&quot;Stolothrissa tanganicae&quot;) at the same time was unsuccessful.

At present, Lake Kivu is the sole natural lake in which &quot;L. miodon&quot;, a sardine originally restricted to Lake Tanganyika, has been introduced initially to fill an empty niche. Prior to the introduction, no planktivorous fish was present in the pelagic waters of Lake Kivu. In the early 1990s, the number of fishers on the lake was 6,563, of which 3,027 were associated with the pelagic fishery and 3,536 with the traditional fishery. The widespread armed conflict in the surrounding region from the mid-1990s resulted in a decline in the fisheries harvest.

Following this introduction, the sardine has gained substantial economic and nutritional importance for the lakeside human population but from an ecosystem standpoint, the introduction of planktivorous fish may result in important modifications of plankton community structure. Recent observations showed the disappearance during the last decades of a large grazer, &quot;Daphnia curvirostris&quot;, and the dominance of mesozooplankton community by three species of cyclopoid copepod: &quot;Thermocyclops consimilis&quot;, &quot;Mesocyclops aequatorialis&quot; and &quot;Tropocyclops confinis&quot;.

The first comprehensive phytoplankton survey was released in 2006. With an annual average chlorophyll in the mixed layer of 2.2 mg m−3 and low nutrient levels in the euphotic zone, the lake is clearly oligotrophic. Diatoms are the dominant group in the lake, particularly during the dry season episodes of deep mixing. During the rainy season, the stratified water column, with high light and lower nutrient availability, favour dominance of cyanobacteria with high numbers of phototrophic picoplankton. The actual primary production is 0.71 g C m−2 d−1 (≈ 260 g C m−2 a−1).

A study of evolutionary genetics showed that the cichlids from lakes in northern Virunga (e.g., Edward, George, Victoria) would have evolved in a &quot;proto-lake Kivu&quot;, much older than the intense volcanic activity (20,000-25,000 years ago) which cut the connection. The elevation of the mountains west of the lake (which is currently the Kahuzi-Biega National Park, one of the largest reserves of eastern lowland (or Grauer&#x27;s) gorillas in the world), combined with the elevation of the eastern rift (located in eastern Rwanda) would be responsible for the drainage of water from central Rwanda in the actual Lake Kivu. This concept of &quot;proto-lake Kivu&quot; was challenged by lack of consistent geological evidence, although the cichlid&#x27;s molecular clock suggests the existence of a lake much older than the commonly cited 15,000 years.

Lake Kivu is the home of four species of freshwater crab, including two non-endemics (&quot;Potamonautes lirrangensis&quot; and &quot;P. mutandensis&quot;) and two endemics (&quot;P. bourgaultae&quot; and &quot;P. idjwiensis&quot;). Among Rift Valley lakes, Lake Tanganyika and Lake Victoria are the only other with endemic freshwater crabs.

===Illegal fishing===
In 2018, over 400 cases of potential illegal fishing were recorded on Lake Kivu. According to the Animal Research and Technology Transfer at the Rwanda Agricultural Board, fish production in Kivu Lake dropped from 24,199 tonnes in the 2017–2018 fishing season to 16,194 tonnes in 2019–2020, which Deputy Director Solange Uwituze attributed to fishing methods that affect fish reproduction. Between May and July 2020, Rwanda Police Marine Unit operations reported 27 cases including 10 arrested poachers for illegal fishing on the lake.

<doc id="511848" wikidata="Q6420123" url="?curid=511848" title="Klein, Texas">
<text>Klein is an unincorporated community in Harris County, Texas, United States, roughly bordering Texas State Highway 99 to the north, Texas State Highway 249 to the west, Interstate 45 to the east, and the city of Houston to the south. It includes the entire area of Klein ISD. Residents of the zip codes 77066, 77069, 77086, 77379, 77388, 77389 and 77391 can use Klein as their postal city. Klein is one of the most diverse, as well as being one of the largest unincorporated areas of Houston.

It is named after Adam Klein, a German immigrant whose best-known great-great-grandson is singer Lyle Lovett. Other famous sons and daughters of the Klein community include actor Jim Parsons, actor Lee Pace, actor Matthew Bomer, actress Lynn Collins, actress Sherry Stringfield, singer/songwriter Derek Webb, actor Ben Rappaport, Major League Baseball players David Murphy and Josh Barfield, NFL players Randy Bullock, Ashton Youboty, Mike Green, and Olympic gold medalists Laura Wilkinson, Simone Biles, and Chad Hedrick.

Klein is served by David Wayne Hooks Memorial Airport, one of just a few privately owned airports in the U.S. to have a Federal Aviation Administration control tower, and home to Civil Air Patrol&#x27;s Delta Composite Squadron.

==Geography==
Klein has a Humid subtropical climate with a 9a Hardiness zone. The area is susceptible to hurricanes and flooding.

The area serves as a fringe ecocline boundary between the Piney Woods, southern post oak savanna, and prairie land as an extension of the Western Gulf coastal grasslands.

Much of the original ecosystem had been cleared for farming. Since then, the community has been rapidly built up by subdivisions, businesses, and mixed land use — and thus very little of the area represents its native ecosystem.

Most of the core Klein area sits between Spring Creek to the north, separating Tomball to the northwest by Willow Creek, and Cypress Creek is the waterway that passes through the center of the greater Klein area. Both these creeks are tributaries to lower Spring Creek (Harris County, Texas) and ultimately Lake Houston.

Parcels along Cypress Creek contain a mix of older undisturbed bottomland forest, private residence, and well-maintained bike trails through public parks.

Prairie-like stretches of oak (Quercus virginiana) and various hardwoods, draped in Spanish moss, are present in and around the Raveneaux Country Club, Klein High School, as well as in public spaces such as Meyer Park.

The Klein Kissing Tree is in Klein. In April 2020 the Texas A&amp;M Forest Service designated it as one of several historic &quot;kissing trees&quot; in the state.

===Flora===
A well-preserved oxbow lake habitat can be found in the Ponderosa Walking Park. Dwarf palmetto Sabal minor and southern magnolia Magnolia grandiflora trees are found in the understory and near the edges of bodies of water and swamps, as well as bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), water oak (Quercus nigra), and black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica) all being present.

===Fauna===
Reptiles from common species like the Red-ear slider turtle, and green anole (Anolis carolinensis), American green tree frog, to more precarious species such as the venomous Texas coral snake Micrurus tener, and the American alligator.

==Government and infrastructure==

The community is served by the Harris County Sheriff&#x27;s Office District I Patrol, headquartered from the Cypresswood Substation at 6831 Cypresswood Drive.

The Harris Health System (formerly Harris County Hospital District) designated the Acres Homes Health Center for the ZIP code 77379. The designated public hospital is Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital in northeast Houston.

As of redistricting in 2023, Klein is split between two U.S. Congressional districts, the 2nd and the 38th. The community is located within the 7th Senate district and the 126th and the 150th House of Representatives districts in the Texas Legislature. The United States Postal Service operates the Klein Post Office at 7717 Louetta Road.

==Education==

The Klein community is primarily served by the Klein Independent School District. However a few minuscule portions of Klein are served by the Spring ISD and the Cypress-Fairbanks ISD.

The Klein ISD area joined the North Harris Montgomery Community College District (now Lone Star College) in 1998. The Texas Legislature designated Klein ISD a part of the Lone Star College district.

==Demographics==
The 2016 estimate for the Klein area was 200,805 people. The racial makeup of the town was 46.3 percent White, 32.4 percent Black, 0.6 percent Native American, 14.8 percent Asian, 0.1 percent Pacific Islander, 5.8 percent from other races. Persons of Hispanic origin, regardless of race, accounted for 28.9 percent of the population. About 21.7% of families live below the poverty line.

Black Americans have been well represented in the Kohrville community dating back since the Reconstruction era. Kohrville school served the area up until 1928, when students were consolidated into Rural High School District Number One, which eventually became Klein High School.

==Parks and recreation==
Harris County Precinct 3 Commissioner operates the Klein Park. The park has four lighted athletic ball fields and toilet facilities.

Meyer Park, a 40-acre park, which straddles Cypresswood Road has 38 multiple-sized soccer fields for different age groups. The park also has four baseball fields, a playground, a dog park, toilet facilities, and pavilions.

<text>Lake Edward (locally Rwitanzigye or Rweru) is one of the smaller African Great Lakes. It is located in the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East African Rift, on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Uganda, with its northern shore a few kilometres south of the equator.

==History==
Welsh explorer Henry Morton Stanley first saw the lake in 1888, during the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition. The lake was named in honour of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, son of then British monarch Queen Victoria, and later to become King Edward VII.

In 1973, Uganda and Zaire (DRC) renamed it Lake Idi Amin after Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. After his overthrow in 1979, it recovered its former name.

In 2014, the lake was the center of an oil dispute. SOCO International entered the premises of the Virunga National Park where the lake is situated to prospect for oil. However, villagers and workers who attempted to stop the oil company from entering the area were beaten up and even kidnapped and tortured. Plans to redraw the lines of Virunga&#x27;s boundaries and exclude the lake were taken into consideration. However, since the park is a world heritage site and the lake is part of it, such plans naturally go against the World Heritage Convention.

==Geography==
===Topography and drainage===
Lake Edward lies at an elevation of , is long by wide at its maximum points, and covers a total surface area of , making it the 15th-largest on the continent. The lake is fed by the Nyamugasani River, the Ishasha River, the Rutshuru River, the Ntungwe River, and the Rwindi River. Lake George to the northeast empties into it via the Kazinga Channel. Lake Edward empties to the north via the Semliki River into Lake Albert.

The western escarpment of the Great Rift Valley towers up to above the western shore of the lake. The southern and eastern shores are flat lava plains. The Ruwenzori Mountains are north of the lake.

===Volcanism===
The region shows much evidence of volcanic activity over the last 5000 years. The Katwe-Kikorongo and Bunyaruguru Volcanic Fields, with extensive cones and craters, lie either side of the Kazinga Channel on the northwest shore of the lake. It is thought that Lakes George and Edward used to be joined as one larger lake, but lava from these fields flowed in and divided it, leaving only the Kazinga Channel as the remnant of the past union. To the south lies the May-ya-Moto thermally active volcano away, and the Nyamuragira volcano in the western Virunga Mountains lies south, but its lava flows have reached the lake in the past.

The Katwe-Kikorongo field features dozens of large craters and cones covering an area of by between lakes Edward and George, and includes seven crater lakes. The largest of these, the long Lake Katwe, occupies a crater across and is separated from Lake Edward by just of land. The crater is about deep, and Lake Katwe&#x27;s surface is about lower than Lake Edward&#x27;s. It is remarkable that the volcanic origin of this area southeast of the Ruwenzoris was not known until it was reported by G. F. Scott Elliot in 1894. Stanley visited Lake Katwe in 1889 and noted the deep depression, the salinity of the lake, and a spring of sulphurous water nearby, but he failed to connect this to volcanism.

High-resolution analyses of the elemental composition of calcite and biogenic silica (BSi) content in piston cores from Lake Edward, equatorial Africa, document complex interactions between climate variability and lacustrine geochemistry over the past 5400 years.

The similarly sized Bunyaruguru field on the other side of the Kazinga Channel contains about 30 crater lakes, some of which are larger than Katwe.

===Settlements===

Lake Edward lies completely within the Virunga National Park (Congo) and the Queen Elizabeth National Park (Uganda) and does not have extensive human habitation on its shores, except at Ishango (DRC) in the north, home to a park ranger training facility. About two-thirds of its waters are in the DRC and one third in Uganda. Apart from Ishango, the main Congolese settlement in the south is Vitshumbi, while the Ugandan settlements are Mweya and Katwe in the northeast, near the crater lake of that name, which is the chief producer of salt for Uganda. The nearest cities are Kasese in Uganda to the northeast and Butembo in the DRC to the northwest, which are respectively about and distant by road.

==Ecology==
Lake Edward is home to many species of fish, including populations of &quot;Bagrus docmak&quot;, &quot;Oreochromis niloticus&quot;, &quot;Oreochromis leucostictus&quot;, and over 50 species of &quot;Haplochromis&quot; and other haplochromine species, of which only 25 are formally described. Fishing is an important activity among local residents. Fauna living on the banks of the lake – including chimpanzees, elephants, crocodiles, and lions – are protected by the national parks. The area is also home to many perennial and migratory bird species.

=== Decline of hippos and tilapia ===

In the 1970s, Lake Edward held a population of around 29,000 hippos in and around the area of the lake. But due to an increase in poaching over the years, there has been a 95% decline in the population, with the population plummeting to only a few hundred by the end of 2006. A terrestrial census was conducted in 2019 assessing that the population was now at 1,500 individuals. The hippopotamus is often poached for its large amount of meat as well as the ivory found in its teeth. Fueled by the high prices that hippo meat and ivory fetch, poachers are consistently hunting for these animals, which is causing a negative impact not only on the hippopotamus population, but the Lake Edward ecosystem and the local fishermen that depend on the lake for survival. 

The hippopotamus population is extremely important to the ecosystem of Lake Edward due to being a keystone species. Hippos produce dung, which feed tilapia, a once abundant fish species found in Lake Edward. One hippo could produce around 25 kilograms or 55 pounds of dung per day, which could feed thousands of tilapia within the ecosystem. With the hippopotamus population declining due to poaching, the food they provide to the tilapia fish started to disappear as well. This has caused an immense decline in the tilapia population, as the decreasing hippo population cannot support the same amount of the tilapia fish species as it did before, causing a growing problem not only for the ecosystem, but the fishermen within the villages that surround Lake Edward.

Being so close to Lake Edward, the villages that are within the area often rely on the fish, specifically tilapia, to support their families with food and money. In the past, Lake Edward could support the fish demand for the entire eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The lake had a production capacity of between 15,000 and 20,000 metric tons of tilapia annually, with an estimate of around 700 fishing canoes on the lake. Due to the decline of hippos in the area because of poaching, this has impacted the amount of tilapia in the lake, which has caused the fishermen in the nearby villages to suffer, as well as the rest of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Many markets are unable to sustain their own fish, now having to import fish from other areas to continue with their business. 

Though, the declining hippo populations are not the only threat to the tilapia in Lake Edward. Due to the decrease in tilapia populations, spawning areas and fisheries for the fish are off limits to fishermen. But some rebel groups as well as robbers or illegal fishers are trying their luck at these areas, often causing even more problems when trying to conserve and increase the tilapia population in the area. Because of this, many villages around Lake Edward as well as the ecosystem of Lake Edward are suffering.

== 2018 Lake Edward Skirmish ==
On July 6, 2018, there was a naval skirmish between the two nations of Uganda and Democratic Republic of the Congo on Lake Edward. This skirmish began as a result of Congolese naval vessels being sent to investigate reports of the Ugandan navy apprehending several Congolese fishing vessels, and civilians. This clash resulted in the death of one person, and the wounding of three others.

Early reports by local Congolese officials claim that seven were killed in the clash, however, this has not been backed up by either national government. On July 9, North Kivu official Muhindo Kyakwa claimed twelve Congolese fishermen had been killed in the clashes.

<text>Fillmore is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in the town of Hume, Allegany County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 603. It was originally known as &quot;The Mouth of the Creek&quot; but was named for President Millard Fillmore in 1850. The former village of Fillmore dissolved its incorporation and is now simply a named hamlet southeast of the town center of Hume. Fillmore is the mailing address of the Hungarian Scout Camp, the main campsite of the Hungarian Scout Association in Exteris, although the camp is technically within the neighboring town of Granger. Fillmore is also the site of the Most Holy Family Monastery which was deemed a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in February 2017.

==Geography==
Fillmore is located where Cold Creek joins the Genesee River, at approximately above sea level, at the junction of County Road 4 and New York State Route 19 and New York State Route 19A. The hamlet is southeast of the town center of Hume and north of Houghton on Route 19 and south of Rossburg (another hamlet in the town of Hume) on Route 19A.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Fillmore CDP has a total area of , all land.

<doc id="511868" wikidata="Q1365115" url="?curid=511868" title="Lake Naivasha">
<text>Lake Naivasha is a freshwater lake in Kenya, outside the town of Naivasha in Nakuru County, which lies north west of Nairobi. It is situated in the Great Rift Valley. The name derives from the local Maasai name &quot;ɛnaɨpɔ́sha &quot;, meaning &quot;that which heaves,&quot; a common Maasai word for bodies of water large enough to have wave action when it is windy or stormy. Naivasha arose from a British attempt to pronounce the Maasai name. Literally, &quot;Lake Naivasha&quot; means &quot;Lake Lake.&quot;

==Location==

Lake Naivasha is at the highest elevation of the Kenyan Rift valley at in a complex geological combination of volcanic rocks and sedimentary deposits from a larger Pleistocene Era lake. Apart from transient streams, the lake is fed by the perennial Malewa and Gilgil rivers. There is no visible outlet, but since the lake water is relatively fresh it is assumed to have an underground outflow.

The lake had a normal surface area of before 2010 and had increased to 198 square kilometres (76 sq mi) by 2020. It is surrounded by a swamp which covers an area of , but this can vary largely depending on rainfall. Situated at an altitude of , the lake has an average depth of , with the deepest area being at Crescent Island, with a maximum depth of . Njorowa Gorge once formed the lake&#x27;s outlet, but it is now high above the lake and forms the entrance to Hell&#x27;s Gate National Park. The town of Naivasha (formerly East Nakuru) lies on the north-east edge of the lake.

==Ecology==

The lake is home to a variety of types of wildlife including over 400 different species of bird and a sizable population of hippos. The fish community in the lake has been highly variable over time, influenced by changes in climate, fishing effort and the introduction of invasive species. The most recent shift in the fish population followed the accidental introduction of common carp in 2001. Nine years later, in 2010, common carp accounted for over 90% of the mass of fish caught in the lake.

There are two smaller lakes in the vicinity of Lake Naivasha: Lake Oloiden and Lake Sonachi (a green crater lake). The Crater Lake Game Sanctuary lies nearby, while the lake shore is known for its population of European immigrants and settlers.

==History==
Between 1937 and 1950, the lake was used as a landing place for flying boats on the Imperial Airways passenger and mail route from Southampton in Britain to South Africa. It linked Kisumu and Nairobi. Joy Adamson, the author of &quot;Born Free&quot;, lived on the shores of the lake in the mid-1960s. On the shores of the lake is Oserian (&quot;Djinn Palace&quot;), which gained notoriety in the Happy Valley days between the two world wars. In 1999, the Lake Naivasha Riparian Association received the Ramsar Wetland Conservation Award for its conservation efforts regarding the Lake Naivasha Ramsar site.

==Agriculture and industry==

Floriculture forms the main industry around the lake. However, the largely unregulated use of lake water for irrigation is reducing the level of the lake and is the subject of concern in Kenya.
Fishing in the lake is also another source of employment and income for the local population. The lake varies in level greatly and almost dried up entirely in the 1890s. Lake levels in general follow the rainfall pattern in the catchment area.

Lake Naivasha, once described as the Jewel in the Crown of all the East African lakes, has in recent decades been subjected to a series of devastating human pressures, not least the establishment of a vast horticulture and agriculture industry along its shorelines, but also the ever-increasing inflows of nutrients from siltation, sewage and other effluents emanating from a lakeside human population now approaching a million people.

In 1981, the first geothermal plant for Lake Naivasha was commissioned and by 1985, a total of 45 MW of electricity was being generated in the area.

==Water levels ==

About 10,000 years ago, Lake Naivasha, together with neighboring Lake Elementaita and Lake Nakuru (60 km further north), formed one single, deep freshwater lake that eventually dried up, leaving the three lakes as remnants.

Water levels in the Rift Valley Lakes have since varied considerably, with several of the lakes almost drying up several times.

The water level for Lake Naivasha reached a low of 0.6 m depth in 1945,
but the water level rose again, with minor drops, to reach a maximum depth of nearly 6 m in 1968. There was another major decline of the water level in 1987, when the depth reached 2.25 m above the lake bottom. The decline of the lake water level in 1987 increased concern in the future of geothermal industry, and it was speculated that Lake Naivasha underground water might be feeding the geothermal reservoir at Olkaria. Hence, the decline in the lake water would affect the future of the geothermal industry.

The surface area of the lake had increased by over 50% by 2020 causing many people to be displaced from the densely populated areas round the lake.

Lake Naivasha still supports many local companies. Some of them like the renowned Watamu Boat Rides Naivasha (watamuboatridesnaivasha.com) make a living by taking tourists and locals around the lake, showing them the major hippo hubs as well showcasing the Crescent Island.

<text>Jean Erdman (February 20, 1916 – May 4, 2020) was an American dancer and choreographer of modern dance as well as an avant-garde theater director.

==Biography==
===Early years and background===

Erdman was born in Honolulu. Erdman&#x27;s father, John Piney Erdman, a doctor of divinity and missionary from New England, settled in Honolulu as a minister at the non-denominational Protestant Church of the Crossroads where he preached, in both English and Japanese, to a multi-ethnic congregation. Her mother, Marion Dillingham Erdman, was a member of one of the founding industrialist families of Hawaii.

Erdman&#x27;s earliest dance experience was the hula. She attended the Punahou School in Honolulu where she learned, as a form of physical education, Isadora Duncan interpretive dance. Reflecting on her early dance training Erdman said these two influences taught her that dancing is an &quot;expression of something meaningful to the dancer, not a mere series of lively steps.&quot;

From Hawaii, Erdman went to Miss Hall&#x27;s School for Girls in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, from which she graduated in 1934. She was troubled by the attitude towards dancing that caused her to be disciplined for teaching the hula to her classmates. Later, at Sarah Lawrence College, which she attended from 1934 to 1937, she was able to explore more freely her multiple interests in theater, dance, and aesthetic philosophy.

At Sarah Lawrence she encountered her two greatest influences: Joseph Campbell and Martha Graham. Campbell, a professor of comparative literature who later became an authority on mythology, was her tutorial advisor. This began a dialogue about the process of individual psycho-spiritual transformation and the nature of art that was to continue throughout their lives. Erdman was also interested in the modern dance technique she learned in Martha Graham&#x27;s classes at Sarah Lawrence and at the Bennington College Summer School of Dance that she attended during the summers of 1935–1944.

In 1937 Erdman joined her parents and younger sister on a trip around the world during which she saw the traditional dance and theater of many countries including Bali, Java and India. Speaking of her experiences on this trip and of her later study of world dance cultures inspired by it Erdman said, &quot;by studying and analyzing the traditional dance styles of the world, I discovered that the particular dance of each culture is the perfect expression of that culture&#x27;s world view and is achieved by deliberate choices drawn from the unlimited possibilities of movement&quot;. Shortly after Erdman returned to New York, she married Campbell on May 5, 1938, and following a brief honeymoon began rehearsal as a member of the Martha Graham Dance Company.

===Career===
Erdman distinguished herself as a principal dancer in Graham&#x27;s company in solo roles such as the Ideal Spectator in &quot;Every Soul is a Circus&quot;, the Speaking Fate in &quot;Punch and the Judy&quot; and the One Who Speaks in &quot;Letter to the World&quot;, Graham&#x27;s ode to the American poet, Emily Dickinson. Dance critic Margaret Lloyd of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; praised the &quot;felicitous humor&quot; Erdman brought to her role as the Speaking Fate and called her &quot;irreplaceable&quot; in the 1941 revival of Letter to the World.

Working with Graham, Erdman had re-shaped the role, originally played by actress Margaret Meredith, from that of a static seated figure to a moving, integrated element in the groundbreaking dance-theater work. In &quot;The Complete Guide to Modern Dance&quot;, historian Don McDonagh writes of the &quot;profound effect&quot; that these speaking roles had on Erdman. He attributes her many explorations of the dynamic between word and movement to these early experiences.

As all female Graham dancers of the period Erdman was required to study choreography with Louis Horst, Graham&#x27;s musical director. Horst presented lecture-demonstrations on his principles in pre-classic dance forms, and his students demonstrated his ideas through their own compositions. Her first solo, &quot;The Transformations of Medusa&quot;, which premiered at the Bennington College&#x27;s Summer Festival of the Arts in 1942, began as an assignment for his class. The final version, with a commissioned score by Horst, remained in her repertory through the 1990s. Erdman&#x27;s performance of this dance was the subject of Maya Deren&#x27;s unfinished 1949 film, &quot;Medusa&quot;.

Originally an exploration of primitive style or archaic style, &quot;The Transformations of Medusa&quot; developed from a short study of the two-dimensional form into a complete dance of three sections. Erdman described the year long evolution of the piece as the process through which she came to understand that every posture contains &quot;a whole state of being or attitude toward life.&quot; The dance evolved as she attuned herself to the physical sensations of the stylized positions and followed where they led her. It was Campbell, informed by his deep well of mythological imagery, who identified the dance character in the first short study as Medusa, the beautiful Greek priestess of Athena who became the hideous snake-headed gorgon. Erdman developed the second and third sections following the development of the mythological archetype.

In 1943, at the urging of Campbell and composer, John Cage, Erdman and fellow Graham Company member, Merce Cunningham, presented a joint concert sponsored by the Arts Club of Chicago. Cunningham&#x27;s solos included &quot;Totem Ancestor&quot;, &quot;In the Name of the Holocaust&quot;, and &quot;Shimmera&quot;, all with scores by Cage.

The two collaborative duets were, &quot;Credo in US&quot;, a dramatic dance with a text by Cunningham and a commissioned score by Cage, and &quot;Ad Lib&quot; with a commissioned score by Gregory Tucker. According to Erdman, &quot;Ad Lib&quot; &quot;was considered rather shocking because it incorporated improvisations. At that time it was not considered acceptable to perform improvs in public. That was for the privacy of your studio.&quot;

Erdman&#x27;s other important works of the 1940s were &quot;Daughters of the Lonesome Isle&quot; (1945) and &quot;Ophelia&quot; (1946) with commissioned scores by John Cage on prepared and standard piano respectively, &quot;Passage&quot; (1946), &quot;Hamadryad&quot; (1948) to Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Syrinx&quot;, &quot;The Perilous Chapel&quot; (1949), and &quot;Solstice&quot; (1950), both with commissioned scores by Lou Harrison. Of &quot;The Perilous Chapel&quot; which featured a moving sculptural set by Carlus Dyer and was selected as one of the Best New Works of the Season by &quot;Dance Magazine&quot;, Doris Hering wrote, &quot;When the dance was over one realized that by means of purely physical and visual elements, Miss Erdman had succeeded in giving a moving picture of the experience of an artist through phases of isolation and realization.&quot;

Other dance critics of the time noted her unique approach to dance making. &quot;New York Times&quot; dance critic John Martin remarked, &quot;that Erdman&#x27;s movement is perhaps as near to being non-associative as movement can be, yet it is freely creative. The method of composition, though naturally without story content, avoids any connotation of being merely decorative, much as non-objective painting avoids it, and manages to be just as strongly evocative.&quot;

Reporting on a group concert at the 92nd St YM/YWHA in which Erdman participated Edwin Denby wrote in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;Miss Erdman&#x27;s (approach) is a more original and refreshing one to encounter. There was a lightness in the rhythm, a quality of generosity and spaciousness in the movement that struck me as a dance should, as a poetic presence.&quot; Walter Terry also writing for the &quot;Tribune&quot; commented, &quot;(Her dance) attracts through rare beauty of pattern, through gently shaded dynamics and through that intangible essence we call quality. It does not appeal directly to the intellect nor to the emotions, but rather it seems to carry its message on its own short-wave system to the senses themselves.&quot;

From 1950 to 1954, she toured the US annually with her company. From 1954 to 1955 she toured India and Japan as a solo artist, the first dancer to do so since World War II. The report she filed with U.S. State Department helped initiate cultural exchange programs with India and many countries in the Far East.

From 1955 to 1960, she toured extensively as a solo artist throughout the U.S. Notable works from her repertory of that period include &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; created to jazz recordings that were layered by John Cage into his eight-track commissioned score, &quot;Dawn Song&quot;, a lyrical solo with commissioned score by Alan Hovhaness, &quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot; (1956; an allegory in six visions inspired by William Blake&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Tyger&quot;) to Ezra Laderman&#x27;s &quot;Sonata for Violoncello&quot;, in which Erdman emerged from and interacted with a metal sculpture by Carlus Dyer, and &quot;Four Portraits&quot; from Duke Ellington&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare Album&quot; (1958), a suite of comic portrayals of Shakespearean heroines. 

In 1960, Erdman reorganized and renamed her dance company to reflect her explorations of the inter-relationship of movement, music, visual arts and spoken text. As noted above this interest began much earlier for Erdman. As early as 1946, John Martin noted, &quot;She is keenly alert to modern experiments in the other arts music, poetry, visual design and employs them freely.&quot;

Her musical collaborations with composer Ezra Laderman which had begun in 1956 with &quot;Duet for Flute and Dancer&quot;, inspired by Erdman&#x27;s interpretation of Debussy&#x27;s solo flute composition &quot;Syrinx&quot; in her 1948 solo &quot;Hamadryad&quot; and culminating in the 1957 group work &quot;Harlequinade&quot;, featuring dancer Donald McKayle, were the subject of a feature story in &quot;Time&quot; magazine in April 1957.

In the theater Erdman had choreographed a production of Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s &quot;The Flies&quot; (1947) for the Vassar Experimental Theatre, the Broadway production of Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s &quot;The Enchanted&quot; (1950) and collaborating with writer William Saroyan and composer Alan Hovhaness, she directed and choreographed &quot;Otherman or The Beginning of a New Nation&quot; (1954) at Bard College. The newly named Jean Erdman Theater of Dance toured the U.S. and gave concerts in New York City. Among the notable works of this period are &quot;Twenty Poems&quot; (1960), a cycle of E. E. Cummings&#x27;s poems for eight dancers and one actor with a commissioned score by Teiji Ito, performed in the round at the Circle in the Square Theatre in Greenwich Village and &quot;The Castle&quot;, an exploration of improvised and structured movement with jazz clarinetist-saxophonist Jimmy Giuffre at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (1970).

In 1962 with the aid of a grant from the Ingram Merrill Foundation, Erdman began what was to become her best-known work, &quot;The Coach with the Six Insides&quot;, an adaptation of James Joyce&#x27;s, &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. The title is a line from the text found in episode 11.3.359. She became acquainted with the novel during the four-and-a-half-year period that her husband collaborated with Henry Morton Robinson to write &quot;A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake&quot; (1944).

While Joyce&#x27;s story is told from the perspective of the male barkeeper Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker, Erdman&#x27;s work a combination of dance, mime, and Joycean stream of consciousness language focuses on the female psyche, as seen through the many incarnations of the main female character Anna Livia Plurabelle. She danced all the aspects of Anna Livia from young woman, to old crone, to the rain itself that becomes the River Liffey flowing through the heart of Dublin. Teiji Ito was the musical director and composed the musical score on a vast array of instruments from around the world including among others, Japanese bass drums, Tibetan cymbals, a violin and an accordion.

&quot;The Coach with the Six Insides&quot; premiered at the Village South Theatre in Greenwich Village on November 26, 1962. It ran for 114 performances and received the Obie and Vernon Rice Awards for Outstanding Achievement in theater. Following the first New York season it began a world tour including engagements in Spoleto, Paris, Dublin and Tokyo. Three other North American tours as well as another New York season in 1967 followed, at the East 74th Street Theater on the Upper East Side. In 1964 the work was featured on the CBS&#x27;s &quot;Camera Three&quot; series and in 1966 WNET Channel 13 produced an interview with both Erdman and Campbell, &quot;A Viewer&#x27;s Guide to the Coach with the Six Insides&quot;. Many dance historians continue to regard &quot;The Coach with the Six Insides&quot; as &quot;the most successful—and celebrated—attempt to unite dance and words.&quot;

Other theater productions Erdman choreographed during this period include the Helen Hayes Repertory production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1964), the Lincoln Center Repertory production of Federico García Lorca&#x27;s &quot;Yerma&quot; (1962) and the New York Shakespeare Festival production of the rock-opera &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; (1971–72), which ran on Broadway for two years and for which Erdman received the Drama Desk Award and a Tony nomination.

Erdman was an active teacher throughout her career. In 1948 she opened her own studio where she taught a style-neutral, concept-based technique she developed by combining her study of world dance with anatomical principles. She described it as, &quot;a basic dance training that would, in its most elementary form give the novice an essential experience of the art form, and in more complex variations create a professional dance artist with a completely articulate instrument capable of responding in movement to any choreographic impulse.&quot;

From 1949 to 1951 she directed the modern dance department at Teachers College of Columbia University. In the summers from 1949 to 1955 she was the artist in residence and head of the dance department at the University of Colorado in Boulder. From 1954 to 1957 she was the chairman of the dance department at Bard College. She was founding director of the dance program at NYU&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts and taught there from 1966 to 1971.
In the 1980s, Erdman began reviving her early dance repertory and presenting it annually at The Open Eye. These performances culminated in the NEA-funded Jean Erdman Retrospective at the Hunter Playhouse in 1985, New York City. &quot;New York Times&quot; dance critic Anna Kisselgoff wrote, &quot;anyone wishing to know something about where modern dance is today can find the roots in this retrospective.&quot; From 1987 to 1993, Erdman served as artistic director of an NEA funded project to create a three volume video archive of these early dance works, &quot;Dance and Myth: The World of Jean Erdman&quot;.

===Personal life===
Erdman and Campbell had no children. For most of their forty-nine years of marriage they shared a two-room apartment in Greenwich Village in New York City. In the 1980s they also purchased an apartment in Honolulu and divided their time between the two cities. Campbell died in 1987. In 1990, Erdman became the founding president of the Joseph Campbell Foundation and continued as its president emerita until her death. Since 1995 Erdman had lived exclusively in Hawaii.

Erdman died at the age of 104 in a nursing facility in Honolulu on May 4, 2020.

<text>The Power of Darkness (, Vlast′ t′my) is a five-act drama by Leo Tolstoy. Written in 1886, the play&#x27;s production was forbidden in Russia until 1902, mainly through the influence of Konstantin Pobedonostsev. In spite of the ban, the play was unofficially produced and read numerous times.

==Overview==
The central character is a peasant, Nikita, who seduces and abandons a young orphan girl Marinka; then the lovely Anisija murders her own husband to marry Nikita. He impregnates his new stepdaughter, then, under his wife&#x27;s influence, murders the baby. On the day of his stepdaughter&#x27;s marriage, he surrenders himself and confesses to the police.

==Production history==
French theatre pioneer André Antoine staged &quot;La Puissance des Ténèbres&quot;—a French translation of the play, by Pavlovsky and Oscar Méténier—in Paris at the Théâtre Montparnasse on 10 February 1888 to great acclaim. Constantin Stanislavski, the Russian theatre practitioner, had wanted to stage the play in 1895; he had persuaded Tolstoy to rewrite act four along lines that Stanislavski had suggested, but the production did not materialise. He eventually staged it with his Moscow Art Theatre in 1902. That production opened on 5 December and enjoyed some success. Stanislavski, however, was scathingly critical, particularly of his own performance as Mitrich. Years later, in his autobiography &quot;My Life in Art&quot;, he wrote:
Actor Jacob Adler had a New York hit in 1904 with his own Yiddish translation—the first successful production of a Tolstoy play in the United States.
In 1923, the German epic theatre director Erwin Piscator staged the play at his &quot;proletarian Volksbühne&quot; (a rival to the Volksbühne), in Berlin. &quot;Our intention,&quot; Piscator writes, &quot;was to move toward a political message from a broad artistic base.&quot; The production opened on 19 January at the Central-Theater on the Alte Jakob Strasse. Having aimed for &quot;the greatest possible realism in acting and decor,&quot; Piscator described his production as &quot;thoroughly naturalistic.&quot; Herbert Ihering approved of its attempt to bring serious drama at low ticket-prices to working-class audiences, though he thought that its attention to naturalistic detail distracted from the core meaning of the play.

Mint Theater Company staged a production of the play in New York City in 2007. They used a new translation by director Martin Platt.

<text>&quot;Daisy&quot;, sometimes referred to as &quot;Daisy Girl&quot; or &quot;Peace, Little Girl&quot;, was a controversial American political advertisement that aired on television as part of Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s 1964 presidential campaign. Though aired only once, it is considered one of the most important factors in Johnson&#x27;s landslide victory over the Republican Party&#x27;s candidate, Barry Goldwater, and a turning point in political and advertising history. A partnership between the Doyle Dane Bernbach agency and Tony Schwartz, the &quot;Daisy&quot; advertisement was designed to broadcast Johnson&#x27;s anti-war and anti-nuclear positions. Goldwater was against the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and suggested the use of nuclear weapons in the Vietnam War, if necessary. The Johnson campaign used Goldwater speeches to imply he would wage a nuclear war.

The commercial begins with three-year-old Monique Corzilius standing in a meadow, picking the petals of a daisy as she counts from one to ten incorrectly. After she reaches &quot;nine&quot;, she pauses, and a booming male voice is heard counting the numbers backward from &quot;ten&quot;, in a manner similar to the start of a missile launch countdown. A zoom of the video still concentrates on the girl&#x27;s right eye until her pupil fills the screen, which is then replaced by the flash and sound of a nuclear explosion. A voice-over by Johnson states emphatically:

The ad was pulled after its initial broadcast, but it continued to be replayed and analyzed by media, including the nightly news, talk shows, and news broadcasting agencies. The Johnson campaign was widely criticized for using the prospect of nuclear war, and implying that Goldwater would start one, to frighten voters. Several other Johnson campaign commercials would attack Goldwater without referring to him by name. Other campaigns have adopted and used the &quot;Daisy&quot; commercial since 1964.

== Background ==
Following the assassination of his predecessor John F. Kennedy, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as president of the United States in November 1963. Many saw Johnson as a ruthless politician effective at getting legislation passed. During his tenure as the Senate Democratic leader, he was referred to as &quot;Master of the Senate&quot;. He often used rhetorical techniques, including the famous &quot;Johnson Treatment&quot;, to gather votes in the Senate. In July 1964, he successfully urged Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act.

In the 1964 United States presidential election, the Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater challenged Johnson. In the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, nuclear war was one of the central issues of the campaign. A public opinion survey conducted in 1963 showed that 90 percent of the respondents believed that a nuclear war was possible, and 38 percent thought it was likely. The same year, Goldwater voted against the ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which eventually was passed by the Senate by a vote of 80–14. Goldwater campaigned on a right-wing message of cutting social programs and pursuing an aggressive military policy. Contrary to Johnson&#x27;s policies, he suggested the use of nuclear weapons in the Vietnam War, if necessary. The Johnson campaign used Goldwater&#x27;s speeches and his extreme political positions to imply he was willing to wage a nuclear war. They portrayed him as a dangerous extremist, notably mocking his campaign slogan &quot;In your heart, you know he&#x27;s right&quot; with the counter-slogan &quot;In your guts, you know he&#x27;s nuts&quot;.

A public opinion survey in August showed that Johnson&#x27;s accomplishments in office would likely yield him only limited support in the campaign. Goldwater ran an attack ad in which a group of children recited the Pledge of Allegiance until their voices are drowned out by Nikita Khrushchev, the then Soviet leader, proclaiming &quot;We will bury you! Your children will be communists!&quot; The Johnson campaign used several rhetorical techniques in the campaign. They emphasized Goldwater&#x27;s extremism and the dangers of trusting him with the powers of the presidency. Jack Valenti, a special assistant to Johnson, suggested that &quot;our main strength lies not so much in the for Johnson but in the against Goldwater&quot; vote.

== Creation ==
Before 1964, campaign ads were almost always positive. The opposing candidate or their policies were rarely mentioned. In mid-June, John P. Roche, president of Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), a progressive advocacy group, wrote a letter to Bill Moyers, Johnson&#x27;s press secretary, which said that Johnson was in a &quot;wonderful strategic position&quot;, and that they could run a &quot;savage assault&quot; against Goldwater. He suggested that a billboard could be devised reading &quot;Goldwater in 64—Hotwater in 65?&quot; with a mushroom cloud in the background. Johnson agreed to devote considerable financial resources to an electronic media campaign—$3 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for local radio advertisements, and another $1.7 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for television network program advertisements. On July 10, the polls showed Johnson leading with 77 percent to Goldwater&#x27;s 18 percent. By late July, Johnson&#x27;s polling numbers had declined to 62 percent.

A partnership between the Doyle Dane Bernbach advertising agency (DDB) and Tony Schwartz, a sound designer and media consultant who was hired for the project, created the &quot;Daisy&quot; advertisement. The DDB team consisted of art director Sid Myers, producer Aaron Ehrlich, senior copywriter Stanley R. Lee, and junior copywriter Gene Case. The aim of the advertisement was to broadcast Johnson&#x27;s anti-war and anti-nuclear positions. Schwartz based this concept on a previous public service announcement he created for the United Nations. DDB handled the casting and filming, while Schwartz managed the audio integration. Both Schwartz and the DDB team claim credit for the ad&#x27;s visual elements, although their true creators are unclear.

== Synopsis ==

The advertisement begins with three-year-old Monique Corzilius, standing in a meadow in New York City&#x27;s Highbridge Park picking petals off a daisy, counting from one to nine while birds chirp in the background. She makes several errors as she counts. When she was unable to count to ten successfully during filming, it was decided that her mistakes might be more appealing to the voters. After she reaches &quot;nine&quot;, the girl pauses, as if trying to remember the next number. A booming male voice is heard counting the numbers backward from &quot;ten&quot; in a manner similar to the start of a missile launch countdown. Seemingly in response to the countdown, the girl turns her head toward a point off-screen, and the scene freezes.

As the countdown continues, a zoom of the video still focuses on the girl&#x27;s right eye until her pupil fills the screen, eventually blacking it out as the countdown simultaneously reaches zero. A bright flash and thunderous sound of a nuclear explosion, featuring footage of a detonation, replaces the blackness. The scene cuts to footage of a mushroom cloud, and then to a final cut of a slowed close-up section of the incandescence in the nuclear explosion. A voice-over from Johnson plays over all three pieces of nuclear detonation footage, stating emphatically, &quot;These are the stakes! To make a world in which all of God&#x27;s children can live, or to go into the dark. We must either love each other, or we must die.&quot; At the end of the voice-over, the explosion footage is replaced by white letters on a black screen, written all in capitals, stating &quot;Vote for President Johnson on November 3&quot;. A voice-over from Chris Schenkel reads the words on the screen, then adds &quot;The stakes are too high for you to stay home.&quot;

== Broadcast, impact, and controversy ==

DDB decided to broadcast the ad on Labor Day, when Johnson was supposed to begin his formal fall campaign. &quot;Daisy&quot; aired as a commercial only once, during a September 7, 1964, telecast of the film &quot;David and Bathsheba&quot; on &quot;The NBC Monday Movie&quot;. As the film is based on a biblical story, it is considered a family film and believed to be appropriate for the advertisement, as its audience would be one the Johnson campaign wanted to target. It was aired at 9:50 p.m. EST, in the belief that most of the young children would be asleep, leaving their parents watching the film. It was hoped that these parents would visualize their child in Corzilius&#x27;s role. Unlike previous popular political advertisements and Goldwater&#x27;s ads, &quot;Daisy&quot; is based entirely on striking imagery and sudden changes in visuals, the lack of music enhancing the sense of realism. Author Maureen Corrigan has noted that Johnson&#x27;s line: &quot;We must either love each other, or we must die&quot; echoes line 88 of W. H. Auden&#x27;s poem &quot;September 1, 1939&quot;, which reads: &quot;We must love one another or die.&quot; The words &quot;children&quot; and &quot;the dark&quot; are also found in the poem.

According to Press Secretary Moyers, the White House switchboard &quot;lit up with calls&quot; protesting the ad. Johnson called him and asked, &quot;Jesus Christ, what in the world happened?&quot; Though initially surprised by the protests, Johnson was later very pleased with the ad and wanted it to be broadcast again, but Moyers convinced him that this was a poor idea. Moyers later said that the ad &quot;accomplished its purpose in one showing. To repeat it would have been pointless.&quot;

Initially, the commercial was referred to as &quot;Peace, Little Girl&quot;. Even though Goldwater&#x27;s name was not mentioned, many Republican politicians and supporters objected to the commercial. The same day, addressing his campaign rally in Detroit, Johnson said, &quot;make no mistake, there&#x27;s no such thing as a &#x27;conventional nuclear weapon&#x27;... To [use one] now is a political decision of the highest order. It would lead us down an uncertain path of blows and counter-blows whose outcome none may know.&quot;

The ad appeared in stories on the nightly news and conversation programs and was frequently replayed and analyzed by network news broadcasting agencies. Valenti suggested that broadcasting the ad just once was a calculated move. Lloyd Wright of the Democratic National Committee said later &quot;we all realized it would create quite a reaction&quot;, adding in a subsequent interview that Johnson&#x27;s campaign strategy was based on defining Goldwater as &quot;too impulsive to trust with the nation&#x27;s defense systems&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine depicted Corzilius on the cover of its September 25 issue. The Johnson campaign was criticized widely for trying to frighten voters by implying Goldwater would start a nuclear war. Thruston B. Morton, a Republican senator from Kentucky, told the Senate on September 16 that the Democratic National Committee was putting &quot;panic-inspired falsehoods&quot; on television; and that President Johnson must take responsibility for them, adding the ad was aimed at &quot;scaring the wits out of children in order to pressure their parents&quot;. Within days of its broadcast, it was referred to as one of the most popular and controversial television commercials. &quot;Fact&quot; magazine surveyed 12,000 psychiatrists, members of the American Psychiatric Association, asking whether Goldwater was &quot;psychologically fit to serve as president of the United States&quot;. Approximately 1,800 replies were received, among which were many claiming Goldwater was a &quot;dangerous lunatic&quot; and &quot;compensated schizophrenic&quot;. The publication of these results was controversial; Goldwater successfully sued and won $75,000 () in punitive damages from Ralph Ginzburg, the magazine&#x27;s publisher. This ultimately led to the American Psychiatric Association implementing the &quot;Goldwater rule&quot;, which prohibits psychiatrists from disclosing their opinions on a public figure&#x27;s mental health unless they have personally examined them and obtained their consent.
Nearly three weeks after its broadcast, Goldwater said that &quot;the homes of America are horrified and the intelligence of Americans is insulted by weird television advertising by which this Administration threatens the end of the world unless all‐wise Lyndon is given the nation for his very own.&quot; In his subsequent speeches, Goldwater defended his views and insisted he wanted &quot;peace through preparedness&quot;. In late September, he persuaded former president Dwight D. Eisenhower to appear in a filmed interview. He asked Eisenhower: &quot;Our opponents are referring to us as warmongers, and I&#x27;d like to know what your opinion of that would be?&quot; Eisenhower referred to Johnson&#x27;s accusations as &quot;actual [nonsense]&quot;.
Though the exact viewership of the commercial is unknown, Robert Mann, the author of the book &quot;Daisy Petals and Mushroom Clouds&quot;, estimates that approximately a hundred million people saw it. Mann said, &quot;What one of the brilliant aspects of the daisy girl spot was they never mentioned Barry Goldwater, never showed his image, because they didn&#x27;t need to. The audience already had a lot of information on Goldwater&#x27;s reckless positions and statements on nuclear war and nuclear weapons... they were trying to use what the voters already knew.&quot;

A few days later, the Johnson campaign released another advertisement, known as the &quot;Ice-cream ad&quot;. The advertisement begins with a young girl eating ice-cream, while a female voice-over warns of the presence of radioactive isotopes like strontium-90 and caesium-137, which originate from atomic explosions, in the food. She discusses the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and Goldwater&#x27;s positions against it, stating that if he is elected, &quot;they might start testing [atomic bombs] all over again&quot;. The Johnson campaign ran further advertisements in a similar vein, including &quot;Confessions of a Republican&quot; and &quot;Eastern Seaboard&quot;. A few days before the election, polls showed Johnson leading with 61 percent to Goldwater&#x27;s 39 percent. Johnson won the election in a landslide victory, receiving 486 electoral votes to Goldwater&#x27;s 52. Johnson received one of the largest margins of the popular vote in the United States history, defeating Goldwater by almost 15 million votes (22.6 percent). As of the 2020 presidential election, Johnson has gained the highest share of the popular vote in a presidential election since it first became widespread in the 1824 election, and the &quot;Daisy&quot; ad is considered one of the most important factors in his landslide victory.

== Political usage and aftermath ==
The &quot;Daisy&quot; advertisement has been used or referenced in multiple political campaigns since first being shown and was an important turning point in political and advertising history. In his unsuccessful 1984 presidential campaign, Democratic nominee Walter Mondale created a commercial on secret communist nuclear weapons in space, which several newspapers compared with &quot;Daisy&quot; because Mondale&#x27;s ad had a similar nuclear theme. In his unsuccessful 1996 presidential campaign, Republican nominee Bob Dole used a short clip of &quot;Daisy&quot; in his &quot;The Threat&quot; commercial; during the piece, a voice-over emphatically states &quot;Thirty years ago, the biggest threat to her [the &#x27;Daisy&#x27; girl] was nuclear war. Today, the threat is drugs.&quot; Other uses of &quot;Daisy&quot; include the 2007 Australian federal election, where the Australian Greens re-made it as one of their campaign ads on climate change. &quot;Daisy&quot; was also re-made in 2010 by the American Values Network, to encourage voters to ask their senators to ratify the New START program. Robert Mann concluded that &quot;DDB brought to politics the same approach it applied to advertising automobiles, soap, and other products. In that way, &#x27;Daisy&#x27; Girl helped usher political advertising into the modern era.&quot;

Corzilius became known publicly as the &quot;Daisy&quot; girl after the broadcast of the commercial, although she did not see the commercial herself until the 2000s, when she searched for it on the Internet. Another child actor, Birgitte Olsen, falsely claimed that she was the girl in the commercial. While campaigning for the 2016 presidential election, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton enlisted Corzilius to appear in a sequel to the ad that argued that Donald Trump was not competent to control nuclear weapons. In the ad Corzilius said, &quot;The fear of nuclear war that we had as children, I never thought our children would ever have to deal with that again. And to see that coming forward in this election is really scary.&quot;

Almost 25 years after the commercial was first broadcast, when asked whether he approved of the &quot;Daisy&quot; commercial, Bill Moyers said:

Yes I did, and I regret that we were in on the first wave of the future. The ad was intended to remind voters of Johnson&#x27;s prudence; it wasn&#x27;t meant to make you think Barry Goldwater was a warmonger – but that&#x27;s how a lot of people interpreted it. If my memory serves me correctly, we never touched on Vietnam in any of the political spots. It haunts me all this time that Johnson was portrayed as the peacemaker in that campaign, but he committed the country to a long, bloody war in Vietnam.

<doc id="511885" wikidata="Q121706" url="?curid=511885" title="Tully, Queensland">
<text>Tully is a rural town and locality in the Cassowary Coast Region, Queensland, Australia. It is adjacent to the Bruce Highway, approximately south of Cairns by road and north of Townsville. Tully is perhaps best known for being one of the wettest towns in Australia, and home to the tall Golden Gumboot.

The Tully River, previously known as the Mackay River, was named after Surveyor-General William Alcock Tully in the 1870s. The town of Tully was named after the river when it was surveyed during the erection of the sugar mill in 1924, although the river does not flow through the town or the locality. During the previous decade, a settlement known as Banyan had grown up on the other side of Banyan Creek.

Tully is one of the larger towns of the Cassowary Coast Region. The economic base of the region is agriculture: sugar cane and bananas are the dominant crops. The sugar cane grown at the many farms in the district is processed locally at the Tully Sugar Mill, and the raw sugar produced is shipped elsewhere for further refining.

In the , the locality of Tully had a population of 2,368 people.

== History ==

Dyirbal (also known as Djirbal) is a language of Far North Queensland, particularly the area around Tully and Tully River Catchment extending to the Atherton Tablelands. The Dyirbal language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Cassowary Coast Regional Council and Tablelands Regional Council.

The Tully River area was slowly settled once Cardwell, to the south, was established. The river was renamed in 1872 in honour of William Alcock Tully, then under-secretary for public lands and chief commissioner of crown lands in Queensland and later Surveyor General of Queensland. The first settlers were the nephews of James Tyson, who raised beef cattle. It was not until the government constructed a sugar mill in 1925 that the town began to develop.

Banyan Provisional School opened on 30 June 1924. In 1925, it became Tully State School. When erected in 1924, it was known as Banyan Provisional and has since gone through a number of name changes: Tully Provisional (1925); Tully State School (1926); Tully State Rural School (1934); Tully State Rural and High School (1951); and reverted to Tully State School in 1964. The school&#x27;s current motto is &quot;Work well and succeed&quot;.

Augustinian priests based in Innisfail began to conduct Roman Catholic services in Tully in 1926. Vicar Apostolic of Cooktown John Heavey laid the foundation stone for a church dedicated to St Clare of Montefalco in May 1926. St Clare&#x27;s Catholic School was established in 1928 by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan. A separate Tully Parish of the Roman Catholic Vicariate Apostolic of Cooktown, now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cairns, was established in 1935.

Tully was originally within the Cardwell Division, which became the Shire of Cardwell in 1903. The first headquarters for the division/shire were in older town of Cardwell. In 1929, the decision was taken to relocate the shire council&#x27;s headquarters to the newer but more populous town of Tully. The first council meeting held in Tully was in June 1929. A new shire chambers was built in 1930 on the south-east corner of Bryant and Morris Streets.

Tully State High School opened on 28 January 1964. During Cyclone Yasi in 2011, B Block was completely destroyed and G Block was damaged. Both have since been rebuilt.

Tully remained the administrative centre for the Shire of Cardwell, until the shire was amalgamated into the Cassowary Coast Region in 2008. The regional council has its headquarters in Innisfail.

In 2019, Tully became the inaugural winner of a Loud Shirt Day competition to find Queensland&#x27;s Loudest Town. Inspired by a local story, and facing strong competition from other regional Queensland towns, members of the community rallied together to raise $13,410 to support services provided to young people with hearing loss.

== Demographics ==
In the , the locality of Tully had a population of 2,436 people.

In the , the locality of Tully had a population of 2,390 people.

In the , the locality of Tully had a population of 2,368 people.

== Heritage listings ==
Tully has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Tully Court House, 69 Bryant Street
* Tully State School, 17 Mars Street

== Climate ==

Tully has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;). This is due to its strong exposure to the southeasterly trade winds. With an average annual rainfall exceeding , and the highest-ever annual rainfall in a populated area of Australia ( in 1950), Tully is arguably the wettest town in Australia. A rivalry exists between Tully and the nearby town of Babinda for that title. 

Although Tully&#x27;s average rainfall is less than that of Babinda, a giant gumboot, the &quot;Golden Gumboot&quot;, was erected in Tully in 2003, as a monument to the town&#x27;s high rainfall. It also serves as a museum, documenting past floods, as well as displaying the rainfall for the current year.
=== Cyclone Yasi ===
Buildings in Tully were badly damaged by Cyclone Yasi on 3 February 2011. According to residents, Tully was &quot;...a scene of mass devastation&quot;. An unknown number of homes were completely destroyed as intense winds, estimated at , battered the area. Many other homes not destroyed sustained severe façade and or roof damage. As daybreak came, reports from the town stated that about 90 percent of the structures along the main avenue sustained extensive damage.

== Agriculture ==
In March 2015, a farm at Tully tested positive for the soil-borne Panama disease. Follow-up testing confirmed the results. One of the strains of the disease affects all types of bananas and has previously only been detected in the Northern Territory. Harvesting continued on the property with strict protocols allowing the farm to continue to operate and distribute product without posing a threat.

Outside experts were brought in to review Biosecurity Queensland&#x27;s performance 15 February to 24 May 2021. Their assessment credits BQ with quick and effective response which is being emulated by other countries. Thus far TR4 continues to be contained to the Tully Valley only and containment is thought to be possible as long as accidental human movement and transport in flowing water can be halted.

<doc id="511889" wikidata="Q304933" url="?curid=511889" title="Lake Abaya">
<text>Lake Abaya (Amharic: አባያ ሐይቅ) is a lake in the South Ethiopia Regional State of Ethiopia. It is located in the Main Ethiopian Rift, east of the Guge Mountains.

The town of Arba Minch lies on its southwestern shore, and the southern shores are part of the Nechisar National Park. Just to the south is Lake Chamo. Savanna, known for its wildlife and birdlife, surrounds the lake, which is also fished by local people. According to the Ethiopian Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture, 412 tonnes of fish are landed each year, which the department estimates is 69% of its sustainable amount.

Lake Abaya is 60 kilometers long and 20 wide, with a surface area of 1162 square kilometers. There are a number of islands in this lake, the largest being Aruro; others include Gidicho, Welege, Galmaka, and Alkali. The lake is red due to a high load of suspended sediments.

The lake is fed by three medium-sized rivers. First there is the Bilate which rises on the southern slopes of Mount Gurage, then runs mostly southward to drain into Lake Abaya at its northern shore. Second is the Gidabo, which rises on the western slopes of the Bale Mountains, then also runs mostly southwards to drain into Lake Abaya at its northeastern tip after having passed the Gidabo flood plains. The third river is the Gelana, which rises at the western escarpment of the Rift Valley northwest of Bule Hora Town. Tributary streams also rise on the eastern and northern slopes of the Amaro Mountains. The Gelana then flows northwards through the &quot;Gelana Graben&quot; in the middle between both mountain ranges before it enters the Bore swamps and finally drains on the eastern side into the lake.

The only outflow of the lake is through the lower reaches of Kulfo River directly below an alluvial fan at an elevation of 1,190 m (at ). The riverbed acts as an spillway in the case of high lake levels and discharges the excess water into Lake Chamo. Usually, the lake level oscillates somewhat, in 2017 it was at 1,175 m, 15 m below the overflow level. In the last 50 years, the lake level has oscillated only ±1.5 m around a mean value which is well below the overflow level. Consequently, the maximum depth of the lake changes only slightly from year to year, in the year 2002 the lake had a maximum depth of 13.1 meters.

In 1896 Lake Abaya was renamed &quot;Lake Margherita&quot; after the Queen Margherita of Savoy, wife of King Humbert I of Italy by the Italian explorer Vittorio Bottego who first explored the region. The name &quot;Lake Margherita&quot; (Lago Margherita) is still used in Italy.

<doc id="511890" wikidata="Q1401614" url="?curid=511890" title="Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee">
<text>The Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, abbreviated as JAC, was an organization that was created in the Soviet Union during World War II to influence international public opinion and organize political and material support for the Soviet fight against Nazi Germany, particularly from the West. It was organized by the Jewish Bund leaders Henryk Erlich and Victor Alter, upon an initiative of Soviet authorities, in fall 1941; both were released from prison in connection with their participation. Following their re-arrest, in December 1941, the Committee was reformed on Joseph Stalin&#x27;s order in Kuibyshev in April 1942 with the official support of the Soviet authorities. In 1952, as part of the persecution of Jews in the last year part of Stalin&#x27;s rule (for example, the &quot;Doctors&#x27; plot&quot;), most prominent members of the JAC were arrested on trumped-up spying charges, tortured, tried in secret proceedings, and executed in the basement of Lubyanka Prison. Stalin and elements of the Ministry of State Security were worried about their influence and connections with the West. They were officially rehabilitated in 1988.

==Activities==

Solomon Mikhoels, the popular actor and director of the Moscow State Jewish Theatre, was appointed the JAC chairman. The JAC&#x27;s newspaper in Yiddish was called &quot;Eynigkayt&quot; ( &quot;Unity&quot;, Cyrillic: &quot;Эйникейт&quot;).

The JAC broadcast pro-Soviet propaganda to foreign audiences, assuring them of the absence of antisemitism in the Soviet Union. In 1943, Mikhoels and Itzik Feffer, the first official representatives of the Soviet Jewry allowed to visit the West, embarked on a seven-month tour to the United States, Mexico, Canada and the United Kingdom to increase their support for the Lend-Lease. In the US, they were welcomed by a National Reception Committee chaired by Albert Einstein and by B.Z. Goldberg, Sholem Aleichem&#x27;s son-in-law, and American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. The largest pro-Soviet rally ever in the United States was held on July 8 at the Polo Grounds, where 50,000 people listened to Mikhoels, Feffer, Fiorello H. La Guardia, Sholem Asch, and Chairman of World Jewish Congress Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise. Among others, they met Chaim Weizmann, Charlie Chaplin, Marc Chagall, Paul Robeson and Lion Feuchtwanger.

In addition to the funds for the Soviet war effort – US$16 million raised in the US, $15 million in England, $1 million in Mexico, $750,000 in Mandatory Palestine – other help was also contributed: machinery, medical equipment, medicine, ambulances, clothes. On May 24, 1942, at the second meeting of the “representatives of the Jewish people”, a worldwide appeal for donations was made to collect money for the purchase of 1,000 tanks and 500 airplanes for the Red Army. On July 16, 1943, &quot;Pravda&quot; reported: &quot;Mikhoels and Feffer received a message from Chicago that a special conference of the Joint initiated a campaign to finance a thousand ambulances for the needs of the Red Army.&quot; The visit drew the attention of the American public to the necessity of entering the European war.

==Persecution==

Towards the end and immediately after the war, the JAC became involved in documenting the Holocaust. This ran contrary to the official Soviet policy to present it as atrocities against all Soviet citizens, not acknowledging the specific genocide of the Jews.

Committee members had international contacts especially in the US at the outset of the Cold War and this may have contributed to them later being accused of treason and espionage.

The contacts with American Jewish organizations resulted in the plan to publish &quot;The Black Book of Soviet Jewry&quot; simultaneously in the US and the Soviet Union, documenting the Holocaust and participation of Jews in the resistance movement. The Black Book was indeed published in New York City in 1946, but no Russian edition appeared. The typeface galleys were broken up in 1948, when the political situation of Soviet Jewry deteriorated.

In January 1948, Mikhoels was killed in Minsk by Ministry of State Security agents who staged the murder as a car accident. The members of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee were arrested. They were charged with disloyalty, bourgeois nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and planning to establish Jewish autonomy in Crimea to serve US interests.

In January 1949, the Soviet mass media launched a massive propaganda campaign against &quot;rootless cosmopolitans&quot;, unmistakably aimed at Jews. Markish observed at the time: &quot;Hitler wanted to destroy us physically, Stalin wants to do it spiritually.&quot; On 12 August 1952, at least thirteen prominent Yiddish writers were executed in the event known as the &quot;Night of the Murdered Poets&quot; (&quot;Ночь казненных поэтов&quot;).

==List of notable JAC members==

<text>Naval gunfire support (NGFS), also known as naval surface fire support (NSFS), or shore bombardment, is the use of naval artillery to provide fire support for amphibious assault and other troops operating within their range. NGFS is one of several disciplines encompassed by the term &quot;naval fires&quot;. Modern naval gunfire support is one of the three main components of amphibious warfare assault operations support, along with aircraft and ship-launched land-attack missiles. Shipborne guns have been used against shore defences since medieval naval warfare.

== Tactics ==
Naval gunfire support is classified into two types: direct fire, where the ship has line of sight with the target (either visually or through the use of radar), and indirect fire, which, to be accurate, requires an artillery observer to adjust fire.

When on the , ships are particularly vulnerable to attack from aircraft coming from a landward direction and flying low to avoid radar detection, or from submarines because of a predictable and steady (non-evasive) course.

== History ==

===Early history===
An early use of shore bombardment was during the Siege of Calais in 1347 when Edward III of England deployed ships carrying bombards and other artillery. An early type of vessel designed for the purpose of shore bombardment was the bomb vessel, which came into use during the 17th century. The burning of Falmouth by the Royal Navy was among the grievances of the United States Declaration of Independence. These were small ships whose main armament was one or two large mortars that fired explosive shells at a high angle. They were typically poor sailing craft that were of limited use outside their specialized role. However, small vessels armed with large mortars saw use as late as the American Civil War, when the Union Navy used them in several attacks on coastal fortifications.

During the 18th century, another special class of vessel known as floating battery was devised for shore bombardment. An early use was by the French and Spanish during the Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779–1782). During the Napoleonic Wars, the Royal Navy commissioned several vessels of the and . These carried either naval long guns or carronades. Floating batteries were used by the French and British during the Crimean War and by both sides during the American Civil War.

=== World War I ===
During World War I, the principal practitioner of naval bombardment (the term used prior to World War II for what was later designated naval gunfire support (NGFS)) was Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy (RN); and the main theatres in which RN ships fired against targets ashore were the Aegean—Dardanelles/Gallipoli, and later the Salonika front—and along the Belgian coast.

In the Aegean the enemy coastal defences (forts, shore-batteries etc.) were fairly unsophisticated; however, on the Gallipoli peninsula these still proved to be difficult targets for the navy&#x27;s low angle firing guns. Here, the fortress outlines tended to blend into the hillside making identification difficult, and the guns presented small targets. Mobile howitzers on the plateau presented even greater problems, since these were higher still, and being completely shielded from view proved almost impervious to naval bombardment.

For RN ships bombarding German targets along the Belgian coast the situation was altogether different from the autumn of 1915 until the enemy withdrawal in October 1918. For this role, the Royal Navy frequently made use of specially designed vessels known as monitors. They carried extremely heavy armament for their size, often a single turret from a decommissioned battleship. With a broad-beamed hull designed for stability and a shallow draft to allow close approach to the shore, the vessels were slow and thus unsuitable for naval combat. Two s were fitted with BL 18-inch Mk I naval guns, the largest guns ever used by the Royal Navy.

The Germans constructed an extensive, well-equipped and well-coordinated system of gun batteries to defend the coast—and especially the ports of Ostend and Zeebrugge. Those ports, and the canals linking them to Bruges, were of major importance to the U-boat campaign in the North Sea and English Channel—and for that reason were frequently bombarded by RN monitors operating from Dover and Dunkirk.

The RN continually advanced their technology and techniques necessary to conduct effective bombardments in the face of the German defenders—firstly refining spotting/correction by aircraft (following initial efforts during the Dardanelles/Gallipoli campaign), then experimenting with night bombardment and moving on to adopt indirect fire (in which a ship can accurately engage an unseen target, which may be several miles inland) as the norm for day and night firings.

In the summer of 1918, monitors were equipped with gyro director training (GDT) gear—which effectively provided the director with a gyro-stabilised artificial line of sight, and thereby enabled a ship to carry out indirect bombardment while underway. This was a very significant advance which basically established a firm foundation for naval bombardment as practiced by the RN and USN during the Second World War.

Between 1919–39 all RN battleships/battlecruisers and all new-construction cruisers were equipped with Admiralty Fire Control Tables and GDT gear, and from the early 1930s (probably earlier) were required to carry out &quot;live&quot; bombardment practice once in each commission. In 1939, therefore, the RN was quite well prepared for this particular aspect of joint warfare.

=== World War II ===
Indirect bombardment reached its zenith during World War II, when the availability of man-portable radio systems and sophisticated relay networks allowed forward observers to transmit targeting information and provide almost instant accuracy reports once troops had landed. Battleships, cruisers (including Bobtail cruisers, designed to support amphibious operations), and destroyers would pound shore installations, sometimes for days, in the hope of reducing fortifications and weakening defending forces. Obsolete battleships unfit for combat against other ships were often used as floating gun platforms expressly for this purpose. However, given the relatively primitive nature of the fire control computers and radar of the era combined with the high velocity of naval gunfire, accuracy depended upon designated observer aircraft until troops landed and were able to radio back reports to the ship. Observation seaplanes proved vulnerable to land-based fighter aircraft during the invasion of Sicily so gunfire observers flew Spitfires in support of the Normandy landings.

The solution was to engage in longer bombardment periods—up to two weeks, in some cases—saturating target areas with fire until a lucky few shells had destroyed the intended targets. This alerted an enemy that a landing attack was imminent. In the Pacific War this mattered less, where the isolated defenders of island strongholds expected to be invaded at some point and had already committed whatever combat resources were available. The Japanese used battleships only once for shore bombardment, when two battleships bombarded United States Marines at Guadalcanal&#x27;s Henderson Airfield in October 1942, inflicting minor damage. Bombardment periods were usually shorter in the European theatre, where surprise was more often valued, overland reinforcement far more likely, and ships&#x27; guns were responding to the movements of mobile defenders, not whittling away at static fortifications.

Naval gunfire could reach as far as inland and was often used to supplement land-based artillery. Naval gunfire was used extensively throughout Normandy, although initially the surprise nature of the landings precluded a drawn-out bombardment which could have reduced the Atlantic Wall defences sufficiently.

=== Late 20th century ===
Naval gunfire support played a critical role in the Korean War; the conflict was ideal for this type of service, with much of the fighting taking place along the coast of the Korean Peninsula. The battleship and light cruiser provided heavy support, along with numerous light cruisers and destroyers. In particular were so-called &quot;Trainbuster&quot; patrols, working with spotter aircraft to destroy North Korean supply trains, as well as railway bridges and tunnels.

In 1961, the annexation of Goa by Indian naval gunfire support was provided by the Indian Navy&#x27;s cruisers, destroyers, and frigates in support of Indian Army operations.

During the Vietnam War, Task Unit 70.8.9, the U.S. Naval Gunfire Support Unit, was made up of destroyers armed with 5-inch/38 caliber or 5-inch/54 caliber guns, and continuously patrolled the coast of South Vietnam to provide NGFS at short notice. If greater firepower was required then larger gunned cruisers were called in for reinforcements, along with the battleship USS &quot;New Jersey&quot; for a single tour of duty. NGFS was controlled by the United States Marines Corps First Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company which provided spotters, usually airborne in light aircraft but sometimes on foot, in all military regions.

During the Falklands War, naval gunfire support for the British Armed Forces of the British Task Force was utilized by British ships of the same British Task Force during numerous battles. These battles included, but were not limited to; Battle of Two Sisters (HMS Glamorgan (D19)&#x27;s twin 4.5-inch (114 mm) guns provided support) and the Battle of Mount Kent (naval gunfire support provided by HMS Yarmouth), both battles took place on the night of 11-12 June, 1982. 

During the Multinational Force in Lebanon, naval gunfire support was provided on several occasions by destroyers, cruisers, and &quot;New Jersey&quot; assigned to coastal patrol. They supported the US Marines as well as the Lebanese Army. In 1991, during Operation Desert Storm the battleships and fired Tomahawk cruise missiles along with their main battery guns against Iraqi targets in the Euphrates Delta. This was the last firing of battleship guns during war, as well as the first use of drone aircraft to observe targets and give targeting corrections. In the 2003 invasion of Iraq, NGFS was used in support of operations on the Al-Faw peninsula in the early stages of the war by Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy frigates.

=== 21st century ===

As part of Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa, on 1 June 2007, the American destroyer shelled jihadist positions at Bargal, Somalia.

Naval gunfire occurred multiple times during the First and Second Libyan Civil War. During Operation Unified Protector in 2011 in Libya, allied forces provided gun naval support to rebel forces. The French Navy fired approximately 3,000 shells against military targets (the warships , , , ). Also, during the Battle of Sirte in 2016, the destroyer USS Carney conducted shore bombardments of ISIS positions as part of Operation Odyssey Lightning.

==United States==
Naval gunfire is still used for many of its traditional purposes. In the Marine Corps, artillery units have several naval gunfire liaison officers (NGLO, pronounced &quot;no-glow&quot;) in each battalion to maintain close contact with the Navy for amphibious operations. The NGLO is responsible for the Shore Fire Control Party and works in the Fire Control Center with other liaison officers to coordinate naval gunfire with close air support, mortars, and howitzers. The NGLO joins the others in the planning of fire missions in support of the Marine Infantry Regiment.

The Marine Corps maintains three active (1st, 2nd, &amp; 5th) and three reserve (3rd, 4th &amp; 6th) Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company (ANGLICO) units. ANGLICO members are temporarily assigned to combat units of the United States and foreign nations that lack inherent fire support capability, such as naval gunfire. The ships equipped with the large caliber guns of the early and middle of the 20th century have all been decommissioned. The last American battleship, , was decommissioned in 31 March 1992, which left no naval guns larger than in service on any active warship in the United States Navy until the introduction of the Zumwalt class with the 155 mm (6.1 inch) Advanced Gun System (however these larger guns are functionally inoperable because no ammunition was purchased for them). The aircraft carrier and sea to land missile have been used instead. The remaining naval artillery typically has more advanced targeting systems than the older large-caliber artillery.

Within the U.S. there was a long debate over the role naval gunfire support should play in warfare. This took on a greater sense of urgency with the removal of the last two battleships from the Naval Vessel Register.

==Continued naval gunfire support training==
Despite the reduction in calibre size to guns, even ground-based NATO forces&#x27; artillery observers and Forward Air Controllers are taught the rudiments of calling in and adjusting naval gunfire. With the exception of a few procedures, the controlling principles are quite similar in both land and naval bombardment. Shore fire control parties participate in field operations, often with a Marine artillery battery to provide simulated naval gunfire support. When available, Marine spotters will call the fire missions for naval ships undergoing their gunnery qualification tests, to provide both parties the opportunity to practice their skills. One use of naval gunfire in modern operations is to provide Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses for close air support. Well-timed salvos provide covering fire for sorties and prevent enemy troops and batteries from effectively using anti-aircraft weapons.

<text>Gerrit Parmele Judd (April 23, 1803 – July 12, 1873) was an American physician and missionary to the Kingdom of Hawaii who later renounced his American citizenship and became a trusted advisor and cabinet minister to King Kamehameha III. 

He married missionary and historian Laura Fish Judd in 1827.

== Life ==
Judd was born April 23, 1803, in Paris, Oneida County, New York, the son of Elnathan Judd and his wife Betsey Hastings. On his mother&#x27;s side, he was descended from Thomas Hastings, who came from the East Anglian area of England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634. He received his middle name in honor of his maternal grandmother, Eunice Parmele.

He was educated as a physician at the medical college in Fairfield, New York. He married Laura Fish (1804–1872) on September 20, 1827, in Clinton, Oneida County, New York.
The couple sailed to Hawaii (then known as the &#x27;Sandwich Islands&#x27;) that same year, on the ship &quot;Parthian&quot;, the third company from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.
He was assigned to the mission at Honolulu on the island of Oahu, as a missionary physician, and continued in that employment fifteen years.

==Work==
In 1842 he resigned from the mission and became an advisor and translator to King Kamehameha III.
He also became involved in the civil concerns of the islands, and was the King’s Minister of Foreign Affairs from November 1843 to March 1845, Minister of Interior from March 1845 to February 1846, Minister of Finance from April 1846 to September 1853, and in the House of Representatives from 1858 to 1859. He was commissioned in 1849 as Minister Plenipotentiary to England, France and the United States.

He was one of the founders of the Punahou School for children of the missionaries in 1841. He founded Hawaii&#x27;s first medical school in 1870, and was the author of one of the first medical texts written in Hawaiian, , in 1838.

In 1850 Judd purchased from King Kamehameha the land which became the Kualoa Ranch on the Windward Coast of Oahu. His descendants still own and operate the ranch today.

Judd died July 12, 1873, in Honolulu and was buried in the Oahu Cemetery.

==Family==
Judd and his wife Laura had nine children: 
#Gerrit Parmele II born March 8, 1829, died November 13, 1839, buried in Oahu Cemetery.
#Elizabeth Kinau born July 5, 1831, died August 21, 1918. Married September 29, 1857, to Samuel Gardner Wilder (1831–1888) from Leominster, Massachusetts, six children.
#Helen Seymour born August 27, 1833, and died April 2, 1911.
#Charles Hastings born September 8, 1835 (twin) died April 18, 1890. Married November 1, 1859, to Emily Catherine Cutts (1840–1921), four children. Worked in the Guano and farming businesses, and held several posts in the Kingdom.
#Laura Fish born September 8, 1835 (twin) died November 22, 1888, at San Francisco, California. Married February 22, 1861, to Joshua Gill Dickson (1830–1880), four children.
#Albert Francis born January 7, 1838, died May 20, 1900. Married April 4, 1872, to Agnes Hall Boyd (1844–1934) nine children. Last child Lawrence M. Judd became Governor of the Territory of Hawaii in 1929–1934.
#Allan Wilkes born April 20, 1841, and died March 26, 1875. 
#Sybil Augusta born March 16, 1843, and died September 1, 1904. Married February 27, 1862, to Henry Alpheus Peirce Carter (1837–1891), seven children. Son Charles Lunt was a member of the Committee of Safety, and son George Robert was Governor of the Territory of Hawaii (1903–1907).
#Juliet Isabelle &quot;Julie&quot; born March 28, 1846, and died June 27, 1857.

==Legacy==
Judd&#x27;s life was the basis of the novel &quot;The White King&quot;. A biography, &quot;Dr. Judd, Hawaii’s Friend&quot; was written by his great-grandson Gerrit P. Judd IV (1915–1971) and published in 1960. His papers were kept under restricted access at the Bishop Museum until his great-grandson Albert Francis Judd III died in 2006.

Judd Street in Honolulu is named in his honour, as is Judd Trail off Old Pali Road in Nu&#x27;uanu.

<text>John Patrick McCarthy (born 27 November 1956) is a British journalist, writer and broadcaster, and one of the hostages in the Lebanon hostage crisis. McCarthy was the United Kingdom&#x27;s longest-held hostage in Lebanon, where he was a prisoner for more than five years.

==Career==
He attended Lochinver House School, then Haileybury and Imperial Service College, Hertfordshire, and read American Studies at the University of Hull.

McCarthy was a journalist working for United Press International Television News at the time of his kidnap by Islamic Jihad terrorists in Lebanon. He had recently arrived in Beirut when on 17 April 1986, two days after USAF airstrikes on Libya, WTN ordered him to leave. He was being escorted to the airport when a group of gunmen intercepted his car. He was held in captivity until release on 8 August 1991. He shared a cell with the Irish hostage Brian Keenan for several years. While a prisoner, he learned that his girlfriend, Jill Morrell, was actively campaigning for his release, launching a group called &quot;Friends of John McCarthy&quot;.

By the time of McCarthy&#x27;s release, his mother Sheila had died of cancer, unaware of his fate. Following his release, he co-wrote, with Morrell, a memoir of his years in captivity, entitled &quot;Some Other Rainbow&quot;. Their relationship ended four years later, and he married Anna Ottewill, a photographer, on 16 April 1999. They have a daughter.

In 1995 John McCarthy sailed around the coast of Britain with Sandi Toksvig, making a BBC documentary TV series, &quot;Island Race&quot;, and a book of the experience. McCarthy had attended university with Toksvig&#x27;s brother, Nick. He co-presented the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Excess Baggage&quot;, also with Sandi Toksvig. On 29 March 2014, McCarthy hosted the ceremony for the &quot;I Do To Equal Marriage&quot; event which celebrated the introduction of same-sex marriage in England and Wales. Toksvig renewed her vows to her civil partner at the event.

==Honours and affiliations==
McCarthy is a Patron of Freedom from Torture (formerly the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture), and has been awarded an honorary D.Litt. from his &quot;alma mater&quot;, the University of Hull, where a students&#x27; union bar (now an ice cream parlour) is named after him.

He was awarded a CBE in the 1992 New Year Honours List.

*The set of Series 1 of &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot;, first aired in 1990, included a copy of a &quot;Wanted&quot; poster with McCarthy&#x27;s photograph released during the campaign on his behalf. It is displayed on the wall in the news room and is frequently in shot, but not mentioned in the programme.
*The 1993 HBO film &quot;Hostages&quot;, starring Colin Firth as McCarthy, was a fictionalised account of the Lebanon hostage crisis.
*A film version of his and Keenan&#x27;s kidnapping and incarceration was made in 2003. Titled &quot;Blind Flight&quot;, the British film was directed by John Furse starring Ian Hart as Keenan and Linus Roache as McCarthy.
*In 2006 McCarthy collaborated with the composer Adam Gorb and the librettist Ben Kaye to create &quot;Thoughts Scribbled on a Blank Wall&quot;, an exploration of the mental torture he underwent during his long incarceration. Commissioned by JAM (John Armitage Memorial), the work premiered in Fleet Street to critical acclaim in 2007 and was described by BBC Radio 3&#x27;s Sean Rafferty as &quot;Powerful stuff. A protest Cantata, the first of a genre.&quot; &quot;Thoughts Scribbled on a Blank Wall&quot; was scheduled for CD release in 2011.
*The Stiff Little Fingers song &quot;Beirut Moon&quot; was inspired by McCarthy&#x27;s ordeal. It criticized the government for not acting to free him and was subsequently withdrawn from sale.
*A major Sky Arts series, &quot;Art of Faith&quot;, presented by McCarthy, was broadcast in 2008. The series, produced by Illuminations, was an exploration of the art and architecture of Islam, Christianity and Judaism. In 2009, production of a follow-up series of &quot;Art of Faith&quot; began, featuring Buddhism, Hinduism and religions of the Tao.

<doc id="511900" wikidata="Q16249242" url="?curid=511900" title="Best boy">
<text>In a film crew, there are two kinds of best boy: best boy electric (also known as the assistant chief lighting technician) and best boy grip (also known as the 2nd company grip). They are assistants to their department heads, the gaffer (in charge of electricals) and the key grip (lighting and rigging), respectively. In short, the best boy acts as the foreman for the department. A woman who performs these duties may be called best girl. Recently, some film crews have begun adopting gender-neutral terms for job titles, with one example being &quot;lead electric&quot; as a replacement for the term &quot;best boy&quot; in the electrical department. In 2024, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees has most recently adopted the terms assistant chief lighting technician and 2nd company grip for the electric and grip departments, respectively.

==Job responsibilities==
Best boys are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the lighting or grip department. Their many responsibilities include the hiring, scheduling, and management of crew; the renting, ordering, inventory, and returning of equipment; workplace safety and maintaining discipline within their department; completing timecards and other paperwork; stocking of expendables; loading and unloading production trucks; planning and implementing the lighting or rigging of locations and/or sound stages; coordinating with rigging crews and additional photography units (if applicable); handling relations with the other production departments; overseeing the application of union rules (where relevant); and serving as the day-to-day representative of the department with the unit production manager and coordinator of their department.

The best boy also commonly accompanies or stands in for the key grip or gaffer during technical scouts. During shooting, the best boy may also cover for the key grip or gaffer when he or she is on a break or otherwise away from the set.

On films with very small crews, the electricals (lighting) department often consists of only a gaffer, a best boy, and a few electricians. The grip department may include only a key grip, a best boy, and a few grips. Large-scale productions such as major films commonly include full-time rigging and second unit crews, and in total may hire many dozens of grips or electricians at one time.

==Etymology==
It is unclear why this term came to be used as a job title on film sets. According to the OED, &quot;It has been suggested that it originated as a term for a master&#x27;s most able apprentice, or alternatively that it was transferred from earlier use for a member of a ship&#x27;s crew, but confirmatory evidence for either of these theories appears to be lacking.&quot; The earliest known appearance of the phrase in print is 1931 from the &quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot;: &quot;Among the electricians ... the department head is the gaffer, his first assistant is the best boy.&quot;

As the gaffer is sometimes credited as the chief lighting technician, the best boy electric is sometimes credited as the &quot;assistant chief lighting technician&quot;.

The title is accepted for use in credits by the BBC.

The end credits of the 1982 comedy film &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot; named the Best Boy, then the next line was &quot;Worst Boy&quot;, naming Adolf Hitler in that position.

==Usage outside English==
Many French language films made in Canada use &quot;Best Boy&quot; in the credits. The term has been known to appear in the credits of some French films made in France, but it has not been known to appear in Belgian or Swiss films.

German TV and film crews regularly use the term, because no equivalent phrase exists in German.

In Icelandic movie credits, a best boy is occasionally called &quot;besti drengurinn&quot; (&quot;the best boy&quot;).

<doc id="511901" wikidata="Q5968582" url="?curid=511901" title="IBM 1442">
<text>IBM 1442 is a combination IBM card reader and card punch. It reads and punches 80-column IBM-format punched cards and is used on the IBM 1440, the IBM 1130, the IBM 1800 and System/360 and is an option on the IBM System/3.

==Overview==
The 1442 can read up to 400 cards per minute. Cards are read and punched one column at a time and binary cards are permitted. Cards are read using photocells, illuminated by fiber optics, unlike the IBM 1402, which uses wire brushes to read cards. It is even possible to create (but not read, except in Binary Mode) &quot;IBM Doilies,&quot; cards with every possible hole punched. Few other pieces of IBM equipment could do this without sustaining damage.

There are two output stackers, located in the photo on the left lower side. One could program to select the output stacker for each card read, so it is possible to read cards and separate them into two groups. Cards are placed in the top hopper (&quot;face down, nine-edge leading&quot;) and a plate is added on the top of the cards. They are read thru and come out to one of the left lower stackers.

The 1442 does not print on the top of the cards; it just punches what characters the columns contains. An older unit record machine, the IBM 557 interpreter, can be used off-line for this function.

==Models==
Not all models have both read and punch features.

===Reader/Punch models===
* The 1442 Model 1 reads cards at 80 cards per minute (cpm) and punches at 50 to 270 cpm, depending on the number of columns punched. One stacker is standard and a second is optional.
* The 1442 Model 2 reads cards at 400 cpm and punches from 91 to 360 cpm. Two stackers are standard.
* The 1442 Model 6 attaches to an IBM System/3 or IBM 1130, reads 300 cpm and punches 80 columns per second.
* The 1442 Model 7 attaches to an IBM System/3 or IBM 1130, reads 400 cpm and punches 180 columns per second.
* The 1442 Model N1 attaches to the IBM System/360 and IBM System/370, reads 400 cards per minute and punches 160 columns per second.

===Reader models===
The following units were not designed to punch cards:
* The 1442 Model 3 attaches to an IBM 1410 or IBM 7010 computer system. It reads cards at 400 cpm. One stacker is standard on the Model 3.
* The 1442 Model 4 attaches to an IBM 1440 computer system. It reads cards at 400 cpm. Two stackers are standard on the Model 4.

===Punch only===
* The 1442 Model 5 is a punch-only device that attaches to the IBM 2922 Programmable Terminal and to the IBM System/360 Model 20. It has one stacker and can punch at a maximum rate of 160 columns per second, which is 91 to 355 cards per minute.
* The 1442 Model N2 is a punch-only device that attaches to the IBM System/360 (except the model 20) and IBM System/370. It punches at 160 columns per second.
==2501/1442 combination==
The 1442 has two weaknesses for those wanting more throughput:
* Maximum input speed is 400 cards per minute
* The 1442 needs attention for every column of data.

By combining the higher speed IBM 2501 card reader and a punch-only IBM 1442, the 1442&#x27;s limitations are overcome:
* faster input
* the 2501 is buffered and therefore will not overrun if the channel is too busy with other devices to give it attention whenever a column has been read.

<doc id="511906" wikidata="Q333615" url="?curid=511906" title="Raymond Radiguet">
<text>Raymond Radiguet (; 18 June 1903 – 12 December 1923) was a French novelist and poet whose two novels were noted for their explicit themes, and unique style and tone.

==Early life==
Radiguet was born in Saint-Maur, Val-de-Marne, close to Paris, the son of a caricaturist. In 1917, he moved to the city. Soon he would drop out of the Lycée Charlemagne, where he studied, in order to pursue his interests in journalism and literature.

==Career==
In early 1923, Radiguet published his first and most famous novel, &quot;Le Diable au corps&quot; (&quot;The Devil in the Flesh&quot;). The story of a young married woman who has an affair with a 16-year-old boy while her husband is away fighting at the front provoked scandal in a country that had just been through World War I. Though Radiguet denied it, it was established later that the story was in large part autobiographical.

His second novel, &quot;Le bal du Comte d&#x27;Orgel&quot; (&quot;The Ball of Count Orgel&quot;), also dealing with adultery, was only published posthumously in 1924, and also proved controversial.

In addition to his two novels, Radiguet&#x27;s works include a few poetry volumes and a play.

===Associations===
He associated himself with the Modernist set, befriending Pablo Picasso, Max Jacob, Jean Hugo, Juan Gris and especially Jean Cocteau, who became his mentor. Radiguet also had several well-documented relationships with women. An anecdote told by Ernest Hemingway has an enraged Cocteau charging Radiguet (known in the Parisian literary circles as &quot;Monsieur Bébé&quot; – Mister Baby) with decadence for his tryst with a female model: &quot;Bébé est vicieuse. Il aime les femmes.&quot; (&quot;Baby is depraved. He likes women.&quot; [Note the use of the feminine adjective.]) Radiguet, Hemingway implies, employed his sexuality to advance his career: being a writer &quot;who knew how to make his career not only with his pen but with his pencil.&quot;

===Literary reactions===
In 1945, Steadman and Blake write that admirers of his first novel &quot;include the most discriminating of critics.&quot; Aldous Huxley is quoted as declaring that Radiguet had attained the literary control that others required a long career to reach. François Mauriac said that &quot;Le Diable au corps&quot; is &quot;unretouched and seems shocking, but nothing so resembles cynicism as clairvoyance. No adolescent before Radiguet has delivered to us the secret of that age: we have all falsified it.&quot;

==Death==
On 12 December 1923, Radiguet died at age 20 in Paris of typhoid fever, which he contracted after a trip he took with Cocteau. Cocteau, in an interview with &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, stated that Radiguet had told him three days before his death that, &quot;In three days, I am going to be shot by the soldiers of God.&quot; In reaction to this death Francis Poulenc wrote, &quot;For two days I was unable to do anything, I was so stunned&quot;.

In her 1932 memoir, &quot;Laughing Torso&quot;, British artist Nina Hamnett describes Radiguet&#x27;s funeral: 
&quot;The church was crowded with people. In the pew in front of us was the negro band from Le Boeuf sur le Toit. Picasso was there, Brâncuși and so many celebrated people that I cannot remember their names. Radiguet&#x27;s death was a terrible shock to everyone. Coco Chanel, the celebrated dressmaker, arranged the funeral. It was most wonderfully done. Cocteau was too ill to come. [...] Cocteau was terribly upset and could not see anyone for weeks afterwards. I wrote to him in February and asked him if I could come and see him. He wrote me a charming letter:

25 février 1924&lt;br&gt;CHERE NINA&lt;br&gt;Je suis toujours malade et sans courage.&lt;br&gt;Telephonez un matin.&lt;br&gt;De coeur,&lt;br&gt;JEAN COCTEAU

&quot;English Translation&quot;

25 February 1924&lt;br&gt;DEAR NINA&lt;br&gt;I am still sick and without courage.&lt;br&gt;Call me one morning.&lt;br&gt;From the heart,&lt;br&gt;JEAN COCTEAU&quot;

==Film adaptations==
In 1947, Claude Autant-Lara released his film &quot;Le diable au corps&quot;, based on Radiguet&#x27;s novel, and starring Gérard Philipe. Coming just after World War II, the movie caused controversy in its turn. Among the other cinematic versions of Radiguet&#x27;s story, the heavily adapted version by Marco Bellocchio, &quot;Il diavolo in corpo&quot; (1986), was notable as being among the first mainstream films to show unsimulated sex.

In 1970, &quot;Le Bal du compte d&#x27;Orgel&quot; was adapted into a film, starring Jean-Claude Brialy as Le comte Anne d&#x27;Orgel. It was the last movie directed by Marc Allégret, who, like Radiguet, had once fallen under the spell of Cocteau.

== In popular culture ==
The artist David Cilnius has dedicated his lyric/poem &quot;Whip the poor will&quot; to the writer&#x27;s premature death, quoting Radiguet&#x27;s last words.

<text>James Shaver Charleston Woodsworth (July 29, 1874 – March 21, 1942) was a Canadian Methodist minister, politician, and labour activist. He was a pioneer of the Canadian Social Gospel, a Christian religious movement with social democratic values and links to organized labour. A long-time leader and publicist in the movement, Woodsworth served as an elected member of the federal parliament from 1921 until his death in 1942. In 1932, he helped to found the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), a socialist political party which was the predecessor to the New Democratic Party (NDP).

While studying at Oxford, he became interested in social welfare, and upon his return to Canada as a minister of the Methodist Church he preached the Social Gospel to the poor and the working classes of Manitoba. As the superintendent of the All People&#x27;s Mission in Winnipeg and the secretary of the Canadian Welfare League, he focused on investigating social conditions, worked with immigrants, and campaigned for social welfare.

Woodsworth&#x27;s focus on social issues and inequality led him to become active in the political labour movement in Canada. He led the protest campaign following the brutal police action which caused one person to be killed during the Winnipeg General Strike in 1919 and helped to organize the Manitoba Independent Labour Party (ILP). He ran and was elected to the House of Commons as a member of the ILP in 1921. In 1932 during the Great Depression, Woodsworth and the ILP along with other socialist and labour groups founded the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), with Woodsworth as its leader. The CCF, Canada&#x27;s first widely successful socialist party, evolved into today&#x27;s New Democratic Party. Woodsworth influenced many of Canada&#x27;s contemporary social programs including social assistance, pensions and medicare.

==Childhood and early ministry==
The oldest of six children, Woodsworth was born on Applewood Farm in Etobicoke, Ontario, to Esther Josephine Shaver and James Woodsworth. His father was a Methodist minister, and his strong faith was a powerful factor in shaping his later life. His grandfather, Harold Richard Woodsworth, had opposed William Lyon Mackenzie in the 1837 Rebellions. The Woodsworth family moved to Brandon, Manitoba, in 1882, where his father became a Superintendent of Methodist Missions in western Canada. Following in his father&#x27;s footsteps, Woodsworth was ordained as a Methodist minister in 1896 and spent two years as a circuit preacher in Manitoba before going to study at Victoria College in the University of Toronto and at Oxford University in England. While studying at Oxford University in 1899, he became interested in social welfare work. During his stay, the Second Boer War broke out, and Woodsworth was immersed in discussions about the moral values of imperialism. In 1902, following his return to Canada, he took a position as minister at Grace Church in Winnipeg, and, in 1903, he married Lucy Staples.

In this role, he worked with the poor immigrants in Winnipeg and preached the social gospel that called for the Kingdom of God &quot;here and now&quot; and was concerned with &quot;... the welfare and behaviour of the individual in &quot;this&quot; world.&quot; It was not long, however, before Woodsworth became restless as a minister. He had difficulty accepting Methodist dogma, and questioned the wisdom of the Church&#x27;s emphasis on individual salvation without considering the social context in which an individual lived. In a statement of explanation presented to the Manitoba Methodist Church Conference in 1907, he cited concerns with matters such as baptism, tests for those entering the Church, and fasting as a religious exercise. He tendered his resignation, but it was refused and he was offered the opportunity to assume the Superintendency of All People&#x27;s Mission in Winnipeg&#x27;s North End. For six years he worked with the poor and immigrant families, and during this time, he wrote and campaigned for compulsory education, juvenile courts, the construction of playgrounds, and other initiatives in support of social welfare.

==Social activism==
As a mission worker, Woodsworth had the opportunity to see first hand the appalling circumstances in which many of his fellow citizens lived, and began writing the first of several books decrying the failure to provide workers with a living wage and arguing for the need to create a more egalitarian and compassionate social order.

In 1909, his &quot;Strangers Within Our Gates&quot; was published, followed in 1911 by &quot;My Neighbour&quot;. In &quot;Strangers Within Our Gates&quot;, Woodsworth elaborated on concerns related to immigration, and expressed sympathy for the difficulties new immigrants to Canada faced but also offered eugenic interpretations of human abilities and worth based on race. The organization of the book reflects Woodsworth&#x27;s &quot;hierarchy,&quot; with early chapters focusing on Great Britain, the United States, Scandinavians, Germans, and later chapters focusing on Italians, &quot;Levantine races,&quot; and &quot;Orientals,&quot; concluding with a chapter entitled &quot;The Negro and the Indian.&quot;

In 1913, Woodsworth left All People&#x27;s to accept an appointment as Secretary of the Canadian Welfare League. During this time, he travelled extensively throughout the three Canadian prairie provinces, investigating social conditions, and writing and speaking on his findings. By 1914, he had become a socialist and an admirer of the British Labour Party.

In 1916, during World War I, he was asked to support the National Services Registration, better known as conscription. As church ministers were being asked to preach about the duty of men to serve in the military, Woodsworth decided to publish his objections. As a pacifist, he was morally opposed to the Church being used as a vehicle of recruitment, and was fired from his position with the Bureau of Social Research, where he was working at the time. In 1917, he received his final pastoral posting to Gibson&#x27;s Landing, British Columbia. Woodsworth resigned from the Church in 1918 because of its support of the war. &quot;I thought that as a Christian minister, I was a messenger of the Prince of Peace&quot;, he is quoted as saying. His resignation was accepted.

==Political involvement in BC==
Woodsworth and his family remained in British Columbia, where, despite his slight stature, he took work as a stevedore. He joined the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, helped organize the Federated Labour Party of British Columbia, and wrote for a labour newspaper.

==Winnipeg General Strike==
In 1919, he set out on a tour of Western Canada, arriving in Winnipeg just as the Winnipeg General Strike was happening. He immediately began presenting addresses at strike meetings.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Winnipeg &quot;special constables&quot; charged into a crowd of strikers demonstrating in the centre of Winnipeg, killing two people and injuring 30, on Bloody Saturday, June 21, 1919. Woodsworth led the campaign of protest against this action.

The editor of the strike bulletin &quot;Western Labour News&quot; was arrested and charged with seditious libel. Woodsworth took over the duties and after just a week he too was arrested and charged with the same thing. Oddly, his seditious libel took the form of quoting from the Bible Isaiah 10:1 &quot;Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees...&quot; and from Isaiah 65:21,22 (KJV). He was released on bail after five days&#x27; imprisonment, and the charges were never filed. (Other strike leaders served a year&#x27;s imprisonment for their activities.)

His involvement in the strike further established Woodsworth&#x27;s credentials with the labour movement and propelled him to a twenty-year tenure in the House of Commons as a Winnipeg MP. They also affirmed his belief in the importance of social activism.

==Political activism in BC, then in Winnipeg==
Woodsworth briefly returned to British Columbia in 1920 to run as a Federated Labour Party candidate in Vancouver in the provincial election. He received 7444 votes but was not elected. He then returned to Winnipeg.

He became involved in organizing the Manitoba Independent Labour Party (ILP), a replacement for the locally based moderate Dominion Labour Party. The ILP had a platform modelled on that of the British Labour Party, with the slogan &quot;Human Needs before Property Rights.&quot;

In December 1921, Woodsworth was elected to the House of Commons in the riding of Winnipeg Centre under the banner of the Independent Labour Party. This district was abolished before the next election, being rolled into the new Winnipeg North Centre. He served in the House of Commons for the next 20 years, until his death.

The first bill he proposed concerned unemployment insurance. Even though he was informed by the Clerk of the House of Commons that bills involving federal spending had to be presented by the government, he nonetheless continued to press his case for better labour legislation.

He also pursued constitutional reform but was unsuccessful in attempt to have Single Transferable Vote system adopted for federal elections. In 1936, the government set up a committee to discuss constitutional reforms (but the First-past-the-post voting system was not replaced).

Woodsworth was an unflagging advocate for the worker, the farmer, and the immigrant.

In 1929, Woodsworth was a keynote speaker at the annual conference of the Student Christian Movement of Canada, a fledgling social justice movement founded in 1921, and inspired Stanley Knowles, then 21, who later became ordained and helped found the New Democratic Party.

Rejecting violent revolution and any association with the new Communist Party of Canada, Woodsworth became a master of parliamentary procedure and used the House of Commons as a public platform. He at first sat beside the Progressive Party of Canada. He was a leader of the radical farmer-and-labour Ginger Group. This group&#x27;s activities led to the 1932 founding of the first country-wide democratic socialist party, the CCF.

When the Canadian Liberal Party only had minority government following the 1925 election, Woodsworth bargained his vote in the House for a promise from the Liberal government to enact an old age pension plan. Introduced in 1927, the plan is the cornerstone of Canada&#x27;s social security system.

In 1932, Woodsworth toured Europe as a member of the League of Nations Assembly in Geneva.

==Formation of the CCF==

After most of the world went into the Great Depression, Woodsworth and the ILP joined with various provincial farmer, labour and socialist groups in 1932 to found a new socialist party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). Woodsworth was its first leader. Woodsworth said: &quot;I am convinced that we may develop in Canada a distinctive type of Socialism. I refuse to follow slavishly the British model or the American model or the Russian model. We in Canada will solve our problems along our own lines.&quot;

In 1933, the CCF became the official opposition in British Columbia. In 1934, the party achieved the same result in Saskatchewan. One of its founding groups, the UFA, was government in Alberta.

In the 1935 election, seven CCF Members of Parliament were elected to the House of Commons. (None of the UFA MPs were re-elected.) The CCF received 8.9 percent of the popular vote. The CCF, however, was never able to seriously challenge Canada&#x27;s party system, which was then dominated by the Liberals and Conservatives. In particular, the enormous prestige of the long-time Liberal Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, prevented the CCF from displacing the Liberals as the main party of the left, as had happened with the socialist parties in Britain, Australia and New Zealand.

In 1939, many CCF members opposed Woodsworth&#x27;s opposition to Canada&#x27;s entry into World War II. During the debate on the declaration of war, Mackenzie King said: &quot;There are few men in this Parliament for whom I have greater respect than the leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. I admire him in my heart, because time and again he has had the courage to say what lays on his conscience, regardless of what the world might think of him. A man of that calibre is an ornament to any Parliament.&quot;

Nevertheless, Woodsworth was almost alone in his opposition to the war. He was the only Member of Parliament to vote against the bill, and his days as a party leader were over.

He was re-elected to the House on 26 March 1940, but suffered a stroke in the fall and, over the next 18 months, his health deteriorated. He died in Vancouver, British Columbia in early 1942, and his ashes were scattered in the Strait of Georgia.

Woodsworth&#x27;s daughter, Grace MacInnis, followed in his footsteps as a CCF politician.

==Woodsworth&#x27;s legacy==
Woodsworth strongly influenced Canadian social policy, and many of the social concepts he pioneered are represented in contemporary programs such as social assistance, pensions, and medicare, which are deemed to be fundamentally important in Canadian society today. While the party for which he was central founder, today called the New Democratic Party, has largely abandoned Woodsworth&#x27;s vision of a socialist Canada, Woodsworth&#x27;s memory is still held in great respect within the party as well as across Canada.

Woodsworth College of the University of Toronto, and J. S. Woodsworth Secondary School in Ottawa, Ontario (closed in 2005), are named after him. The 18-storey Woodsworth condominiums in downtown Toronto are named after him. Tredway Woodsworth Public School in Scarborough, Toronto is also named after him. In Winnipeg a chrome coloured sixteen-story Manitoba provincial office building built in 1973 is named after him, with a sculptured bronze bust honoring revealed in 1974 to honor his 100th birthday. The Ontario Woodsworth Memorial Foundation merged with the Douglas-Coldwell Foundation in 1987.

The Woodsworth home at 60 Maryland Street in Winnipeg, Manitoba, is now the location of the Centre for Christian Studies. CCS purchased Woodsworth House from the Woodsworth Historical Society in 1998, with a commitment to keep the Woodsworth name and to continue to display photographs of Woodsworth and reminders of his commitment to the social gospel and social justice.

In 2004, a CBC contest rated Woodsworth as the 100th Greatest Canadian of all time.

In October 2010, the town of Gibsons, British Columbia announced that it would be naming a street in a new subdivision after Woodsworth. Woodsworth lived in Gibsons for a short time, beginning in 1917. A Woodsworth street exists in Burnaby, but not in Gibson.

<text>USS &quot;Stickell&quot; (DD-888) was a of the United States Navy in service from 1945 to 1972. She was renamed HS &quot;Kanaris&quot; (D212) (Greek: Φ/Γ &quot;Κανάρης&quot;) in 1972 on transfer to the Hellenic Navy.

== Service history ==
=== 1945–1950 ===
&quot;Stickell&quot; (DD-888) was named for Lieutenant John H. Stickell USNR (1914–1943), who was killed in action at Jaluit Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 13 December 1943 and posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. She was laid down on 5 January 1945 at Orange, Texas, by the Consolidated Steel Corporation; launched on 16 June 1945; sponsored by Miss Sue Stickell; and commissioned on 31 October 1945.

Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Stickell&quot; operated under Commander, Amphibious Training, Galveston, Texas, for a month, 10 December 1945 to 11 January 1946. She then conducted shakedown training out of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, before arriving in Charleston, South Carolina, on 11 March for post-shakedown availability. She shifted to Norfolk, Virginia, on 21 April and, until 6 May, supported carrier qualifications from that port with . She then screened &quot;Kearsarge&quot; to Guantanamo Bay and, from there, to the Panama Canal. She returned to Norfolk on 13 June. Two days later, she got underway for the west coast. Heading via the Panama Canal, she reached San Diego, California, on 29 June and joined Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 11. Over the next four and one-half years, &quot;Stickell&quot; made three cruises to the Far East to serve with the 7th Fleet. During these deployments, she visited the Philippines, the Marianas, Japan, North and South Korea, China, and Okinawa. After each tour of duty in the western Pacific, she returned to duty along the west coast and in Hawaiian waters. Drills and exercises occupied the bulk of her time during the postwar period.

=== Korea, 1950–1952 ===
On 6 November 1950, &quot;Stickell&quot; completed overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard and sailed for the Korean War Zone with DesDiv 52. She made Sasebo, Japan, on 27 November and, three days later, joined the screen of Task Force (TF) 77. The destroyer&#x27;s first Korean War tour lasted until 20 July 1951. During that deployment, she operated with the fast carriers off the southern and eastern coasts of Korea, participated in anti-submarine warfare exercises off Yokosuka, Japan, conducted shore bombardments of the Songjin-Wonsan area and patrolled the waters off Shingjin, Yong-do, and Chongjin for enemy small craft. In addition, she landed Republic of Korea intelligence teams on hostile shores: and she rescued three air crewmen while on lifeguard duty for the carriers. On 20 July 1951, she headed east toward the United States and arrived in San Diego, California, on 4 August.

For almost seven months, &quot;Stickell&quot; remained on the west coast, conducting training operations out of San Diego. On 26 January 1952, she put to sea for the Far East once again. After stopping at Yokosuka from 19 to 23 February, she began her second combat tour in Korean waters. Between 23 February and 19 March, she operated with TF 77 off the coast of Korea and made three shore bombardments; one off Yong-do on 28 February with heavy cruiser ; one at the bombline on 5 March; and one off Singchong-Ni on 11 March with the cruiser . On 19 March, &quot;Stickell&quot; and the rest of DesDiv 52 joined the United Nations blockading and escort force, Task Group (TG) 95.2. As the bombardment and patrol element, &quot;Stickell&quot; not only blockaded Hŭngnam, but also delivered interdiction and shore bombardment fire.

After bombarding Wonsan Harbor on 31 March, she rejoined TF 77 on 1 April and retired with that force to Yokosuka. She remained at Yokosuka during the first two weeks in April; then resumed support for TF 77 air strikes and intermittent shore bombardments. She was in Yokosuka from 29 May to 18 June for dry-docking and repairs before conducting a brief operation along Korea&#x27;s east coast, including a night landing in the vicinity of Pohang Dong. &quot;Stickell&quot; cleared the area on 23 June with DesDiv 52 for exercises out of Buckner Bay, Okinawa. The division returned to Yokosuka on 5 July and, the next day, was underway again to visit Hong Kong and to patrol the Taiwan Strait. She rendezvoused with Carrier Division 3 on 14 July and, with TG 50.3, conducted operations in the Philippines and in the South China Sea, before returning to the Taiwan area to rejoin TF 77 on 27 July. After further operations off the eastern coast of Korea, she entered Yokosuka on 6 August and, four days later, sailed for return to the United States.

=== 1953–1962 ===
&quot;Stickell&quot; arrived in San Diego on 26 August and remained there until 13 December, when she was decommissioned at Long Beach to begin conversion to a radar picket destroyer (DDR). On 2 September 1953, &quot;Stickell&quot; (DDR-888) was recommissioned at Long Beach. Following training out of Long Beach, she joined DesDiv 21 at San Diego on 18 January 1954. Two days later, she and her division headed for the western Pacific. This deployment consisted primarily of hunter-killer training and Taiwan Strait patrol. On 1 June, she departed Sasebo on a voyage to complete a circumnavigation of the globe. Along the way, she visited Hong Kong, Singapore, Ceylon, Kenya, South Africa, Brazil, and Trinidad, She reached Norfolk, Virginia, on 10 August 1954 and joined DesDiv 262 of the Atlantic Fleet.

For the next nine years, &quot;Stickell&quot; served the Atlantic Fleet as a radar destroyer. Between 1954 and 1958, she went through two complete training cycles, including yard overhauls, Mediterranean deployments, refresher training, and NATO and Atlantic Fleet exercises. She received the latest in electronic equipment during her 1958 overhaul; and, soon thereafter, she was outfitted with an experimental data processing and weapons analysis system. In 1961, she earned the Atlantic Fleet Destroyer force Antiair Warfare Trophy. Her seven-month Mediterranean cruise in 1962 was highlighted by an excursion into the Black Sea. In the fall of 1962, &quot;Stickell&quot; participated in the Cuban Quarantine and showed great efficiency by departing Norfolk on very short notice to assume her station.

=== 1963–1965 ===
In May 1963, she entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul. &quot;Stickell&quot; surrendered her anti-aircraft warfare electronics equipment in return for the latest in ASW gear, including ASROC missiles and DASH drone helicopters. Early in 1964, she rejoined the Atlantic Fleet in Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 12 as a straight DD. Home ported at Newport, Rhode Island, she became the flagship of DesDiv 122. Following refresher training in April, she became a unit of the midshipman training squadron and made a cruise to northern European ports in June and July. From August to November, she served with the Atlantic Anti-submarine Warfare Forces; then she deployed to the Mediterranean until March 1965.

She returned to Newport and, in April, shifted to Norfolk to complete her DASH outfitting. In June, &quot;Stickell&quot; joined TF 124, in supporting United States and other OAS forces operating in the Dominican Republic during the 1965 upheavals in that country. After five weeks of patrolling, she entered the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation shipyard at Boston, Massachusetts, for a six-week overhaul. In October, she took station off the west coast of Africa to participate in the recovery of Gemini 6. However, the mission was scrubbed, and &quot;Stickell&quot; returned, via Martinique, to Newport. In November and early December, she participated in amphibious exercises at Vieques Island, near Puerto Rico; then returned to Newport.

=== Vietnam, 1966 ===
On 19 January 1966, &quot;Stickell&quot;, along with the other units of Destroyer Squadron 12, departed Newport for duty with the 7th Fleet in the Far East. After transiting the Panama Canal and brief stops at San Diego and Pearl Harbor, the ship commenced wartime operations in the South China Sea in support of the Republic of Vietnam. While attached to the 7th Fleet, &quot;Stickell&quot; was assigned to Search and Rescue (SAR) and helicopter inflight refueling duties in the Gulf of Tonkin; plane guarding for various attack carriers, especially ; and gunfire support duties. During the deployment, the ship visited the following Far East ports: Kaohsiung, Formosa; Yokosuka, Japan; Subic Bay, Philippines; Hong Kong; route back to Newport — completely circumnavigating the world — crossing the equator near Indonesia. After the &quot;Stickell&quot; visited Port Dickson, Malaysia; Cochin, India; and Aden. She transited the Suez Canal and touched at Athens, Greece; Palma, Mallorca; and Gibraltar. ship returned to Newport on 17 August 1966.

=== 1966–1968 ===
In October 1966, &quot;Stickell&quot; entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for overhaul. She emerged in February 1967 and steamed to Guantánamo Bay for refresher training. &quot;Stickell&quot; then headed for Culebra Island where she qualified as a naval gunfire support ship. After a short inport period, &quot;Stickell&quot; deployed on a four-month ASW cruise. During the northern European segment of the cruise, &quot;Stickell&quot; visited Bergen, Norway; Aarhus, Denmark; Sundsvall, Sweden; and Thurso, Scotland. She operated with ships and aircraft from the navies of Norway, Denmark, West Germany, Great Britain, and France. &quot;Stickell&quot; then entered the Mediterranean Sea and joined the 6th Fleet. She operated with the aircraft carrier and several other destroyers as a &quot;pouncer&quot; ASW Task Force. While in the Mediterranean, &quot;Stickell&quot; visited Naples, Italy; Valletta, Malta; and Palermo, Sicily. On 19 September 1967, she steamed past Brenton Reef Light and was home again.

Before the end of the year, &quot;Stickell&quot; participated in two ASW exercises. The first, &quot;Canus Silex,&quot; a combined Canadian-United States ASW exercise and the second, &quot;Fixwex India.&quot; By February 1968, &quot;Stickell&quot; was preparing for a visit to the Caribbean and her part in &quot;Springboard 68.&quot; After leaving frozen Newport behind, &quot;Stickell&quot; participated in a variety of training operations designed to sharpen her crew&#x27;s already finely honed efficiency. Following &quot;Springboard&quot;, she acted as sonar training ship at the Fleet Antisubmarine Warfare School at Key West, Florida.

The next several months were spent preparing for &quot;Stickell&quot;″s next deployment. On 2 July 1968, &quot;Stickell&quot; left Newport for a six-month, 13-nation cruise of the Indian Ocean as part of the Navy&#x27;s Middle East Force. She visited San Juan, Puerto Rico; Recife, Brazil; Luanda, Angola; Lourenço Marques, Mozambique; Port Louis, Mauritius; Cochin, India; Karachi, Pakistan; Bahrain; Massawa, Ethiopia; Mombasa, Kenya; Assab, Ethiopia; Bandar Abbas, Iran; Bushehr, Iran; Kuwait; and Dakar, Senegal — touching some ports more than once. While in the Persian Gulf area, &quot;Stickell&quot; participated in the international naval exercise &quot;Middlinx XL&quot;. Together with units of the United States, British, and Iranian navies, &quot;Stickell&quot; once again demonstrated her readiness in the fields of anti-submarine and anti-aircraft warfare. &quot;Stickell&quot; returned home on 10 January 1969.

=== 1969–1972 ===
Over the next three years, &quot;Stickell&quot; alternated deployments with operations off the east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean Sea. She was deployed to the Mediterranean again from September 1969 until late March 1970, when she returned to Norfolk, After post-deployment leave and upkeep, she headed to Davisville, Rhode Island, on 18 May for a month of hull repairs. Back in Norfolk again on 20 June, she remained there, except for two brief operations with the aircraft carrier in July, until 9 November when she got underway to off-load ammunition at Yorktown, in preparation for drydocking at Newport News, Virginia, from 13 November until 7 December. For the remainder of the year, she prepared for deployment to the Indian Ocean. Her second deployment with the Middle Eastern Force began on 7 January 1971, when she put to sea from Norfolk and ended on 29 June, upon her return to Norfolk. In the meantime, she visited ports in Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, Bahrein, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Iran, India, Pakistan, Kenya, and Senegal.

At the end of this, her last, deployment, &quot;Stickell&quot; remained in the Virginia Capes area - for the most part at anchor or in port. She spent most of the remainder of 1971 and the first half of 1972 preparing for decommissioning and transfers to the government of Greece. On 1 July 1972, &quot;Stickell&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Navy list. Immediately thereafter, the Greek Navy took possession of her and recommissioned her as &quot;Kanaris&quot;.

== Greek service ==

HS &quot;Kanaris&quot; (D212) (Greek: Φ/Γ &quot;Κανάρης&quot;) was named after Admiral Konstantinos Kanaris (1793–1877), a hero of the Greek War of Independence and later Prime Minister of Greece.

She was commissioned into the Hellenic Navy on 1 July 1972 at Norfolk, Virginia, by Cdr. K. Zografos HN. After sea trials and training she sailed to Greece where she arrived on 29 March 1973. She served in the Hellenic Navy for 20 years as part of the Destroyers Command Force. She performed many patrols in the Aegean Sea participated in Greek and NATO exercises and had active participation in the conflicts with Turkey in 1974 and 1987.

The ship&#x27;s badge depicts the hand of a fire ship captain holding the torch used to set on fire the fire ship, while the fireship sails toward an Ottoman flagship during Greek War of Independence, the same badge used for the later frigate bearing the same name.

She was decommissioned on 15 September 1993, and sold for scrap in 2002.

== Awards ==

<text>Matthew Hale Carpenter (born Decatur Merritt Hammond Carpenter; December 22, 1824 – February 24, 1881) was an American attorney and U.S. Senator representing the state of Wisconsin. He served in the Senate from 1869 to 1875 and again from 1879 to 1881. Recognized as an authority on constitutional law, he made some of the most important legal arguments of 19th-century America. Carpenter presented cases before the U. S. Supreme Court involving such matters as states&#x27; rights and regulation of corporations.
Originally a Democrat, he evolved into a Republican during the Civil War, and helped perpetuate the party&#x27;s political machinery in Wisconsin. His sustained support for President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s administration despite allegations of corruption lost him the backing of reformers, and his legal arguments in favor of Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden in the disputed presidential election of 1876 outraged many Republicans. A gifted orator, he was dubbed &quot;the Webster of the West.&quot;

==Background and education==
Carpenter was born in Moretown, Vermont, in the Mad River Valley of the Green Mountain range. His pioneering forebears were English, and came to America soon after the Pilgrims. His grandfather Cephas Carpenter (1770–1860) helped establish Moretown, owned a store, served as a colonel in the militia and took part in the War of 1812. Cephas Carpenter served in local office including justice of the peace, and though not a member of the bar, possessed wisdom and eloquence that led to a career as an advocate in the local courts.

His son Ira Carpenter (1798–1862) was chiefly a farmer, but he also gained prominence through positions such as justice of the peace, postmaster and state legislator.

Grandson Merritt displayed intelligence and oratorical talents at an early age, impressing people with his abilities to recite Cicero and exhort at religious revivals. He also displayed an aversion to physical work.

After an explosive argument with a schoolmaster, the 13-year-old Carpenter was expelled from school. He was dissatisfied with the limits of Moretown, and left home to live and study law under the tutelage of family friend (and future Vermont governor) Paul Dillingham in nearby Waterbury. For four years Carpenter attended the local grade school while absorbing Dillingham&#x27;s law library. Having received an appointment to the United States Military Academy through Vermont Congressman John Mattocks, Carpenter continued his studies, but he disliked military life and resigned in August 1845, citing poor health.

He returned to live in Dillingham&#x27;s home and managed his law office while Dillingham was then a congressman in Washington, D.C. Upon Carpenter&#x27;s admission to the Vermont bar in November 1847 Dillingham offered to make him his law partner, but Carpenter declined so he could further his law studies under Rufus Choate of Boston. Choate was also impressed with Carpenter, and after a few months he too offered him a partnership, but Carpenter sought to make a name and career for himself in the West.

==Wisconsin attorney==
After reading that the territory of Wisconsin had passed its constitution and was soon to become a state, Carpenter chose to migrate west and begin his career as a lawyer in Beloit on the endorsement of that spot by the New England Emigrating Society&#x27;s Dr. Horace C. White. Arriving in June 1848, Carpenter quickly established a reputation as a successful and affordable attorney, attracting much acclaim from the local community.

His practice was interrupted by a painful inflammation of his eyes which rendered him blind. After traveling to New York to seek treatment, his sight gradually recovered after a year as he convalesced in the Waterbury home of his mentor Dillingham. Before returning to Wisconsin he became engaged to Dillingham&#x27;s daughter Catherine, and they married five years later.

In 1850 Carpenter returned to resume his law practice in Beloit using a new name, Matthew (Matt) Hale Carpenter, after Sir Matthew Hale, the noted English jurist of the 17th century. Despite an earlier warning from Choate to steer clear of politics, Carpenter successfully ran for Rock County district attorney, serving from 1850 to 1852 and 1854 to 1856. He was a Democrat in the tradition of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, but he disdained the party&#x27;s pro-slavery platform while also rejecting Whig Party notions of opposing slavery based on &quot;higher law&quot;—the idea that individual belief of right and wrong permitted an individual to violate objectionable statutes and ordinances. After appearing to lose a close election for another term as Rock County district attorney in 1854, Carpenter successfully argued that courts could look beyond election board certifications and re-examine voter returns, resulting in the election being overturned.

==&quot;Gardner v. Tisdale&quot;==
In 1855 Carpenter discovered that many Beloit residents did not hold legal title to their land because it was sold to them by someone who had pre-empted the land but had not received official title from the government (Congress had previously outlawed the pre-emption of non-agricultural land). Carpenter put forth the theory that the original pre-emptor was still technically the owner of the property. After several complicated transactions, some of which included Paul Dillingham selling new titles to the landowners, and appeals as far as the United States Supreme Court, which included participation by Dillingham, Rufus Choate, Abraham Lincoln and other prominent attorneys, Carpenter&#x27;s legal theory was rejected in a similar case, so the Wisconsin case was withdrawn.

==Barstow-Bashford election dispute==
Wisconsin&#x27;s gubernatorial election of 1855 was thrown into doubt when incumbent Democratic governor William A. Barstow was ruled the 157-vote victor over Republican Coles Bashford by a board of canvassers friendly to Barstow. Discrepancies were discovered in the election returns and political tensions rose as both parties claimed the office and swore in their candidates. Hired by Barstow, Carpenter stalled by repeatedly postponing the case before the state supreme court. He claimed that they held no jurisdiction because elections were matters of the executive branch, which had ruled Barstow the winner. Nevertheless, the court did claim jurisdiction and the ability to examine election tallies (as Carpenter had previously argued for his own election for district attorney). Barstow then resigned, elevating Lieutenant Governor Arthur MacArthur to the governorship. After the court ruled that Bashford was the rightful governor, MacArthur gave up the office. Barstow subsequently refused to pay Carpenter his fee.

Despite his defeat Carpenter had demonstrated his legal prowess to the state. A high volume of his cases required his presence in federal court in Milwaukee, leading to him locating his practice there in 1858. He was also coaxed there by Democratic party boss Josiah Noonan, who arranged a law partnership between Carpenter and Edward G. Ryan, another highly regarded attorney and a force in the state Democratic Party. Despite their excellent credentials, they proved to be temperamentally incompatible, and ended their partnership the next year. Among the prospective attorneys who studied law under Carpenter in Milwaukee was Lyman W. Redington.

By the time Carpenter moved to Milwaukee he had become adept in the area of railroad litigation and sued many railroads on behalf of investors left holding bonds made worthless by fraudulent manipulation. His debut before the U.S. Supreme Court resulted in his winning a judgment against the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company. He was also successful as part of a team of lawyers defending abolitionist Sherman Booth from a charge of rape.

==Loyal Democrat during the Civil War==
Carpenter supported Democrat Stephen Douglas in the 1860 presidential election, viewing Republican Abraham Lincoln as an honest but incompetent sectional candidate. Yet, he warned those in his party that he saw secession as treason, and he would be &quot;the first man to raise a musket&quot; in defense of the Constitution. Following the Confederates&#x27; attack on Fort Sumter in 1861, Carpenter did not enlist but became a rousing speaker in support of the Union cause.

While he saw that many federal actions would be unconstitutional in peacetime, he reasoned that arbitrary arrests and suspensions of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; were acts of self-preservation during wartime and thereby permitted. He also became an early advocate for emancipation, but only as a war measure rather than an act of humanity. Excluded from meetings of the Democratic leadership, Carpenter joined other like-minded party members of the &quot;Loyal Democracy&quot; in considering a third party in Wisconsin, but nothing came of it.

Personal letters he had written saying Lincoln was &quot;idiotic&quot; found their way into newspapers, but Carpenter supported him for re-election in 1864 by making numerous pro-Union and pro-Lincoln speeches.

==Defining the Reconstruction Acts==
Carpenter was the key attorney in a series of landmark cases before the U.S. Supreme Court which helped define states&#x27; rights by determining the legality of the Reconstruction acts passed by Congress.

&quot;Ex parte Garland&quot; dealt with the disbarment from federal courts of Southern lawyers who refused to take an oath swearing they had not taken up arms or assisted the Confederacy. Carpenter argued that the act passed on January 24, 1865, was &quot;ex post facto&quot; (the war had since ended) and a bill of attainder (it punished without a trial). In December 1865 the court upheld his argument with the majority opinion employing phrases from Carpenter&#x27;s brief.

&quot;Ex parte McCardle&quot; concerned the legal authority of the occupying Union Army. Confederate Colonel William H. McCardle, the editor of the &quot;Vicksburg Times&quot;, was charged with defying military authority by inciting rebellion, libeling federal officials, and intimidating voters. After the circuit court denied him a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, McCardle appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Carpenter argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over a president&#x27;s official acts, as in a similar case of his, &quot;Georgia vs. Grant&quot;. Rather than claiming the Union&#x27;s &quot;right of conquest,&quot; Carpenter said the Southern states had surrendered their constitutional protections when they had seceded, essentially reverting to territories.

After he concluded his eloquent arguments, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton hugged him, declaring &quot;Carpenter, you have saved us!&quot; Even McCardle&#x27;s attorney Jeremiah S. Black lauded him as &quot;the first Constitutional lawyer in the country.&quot; However, Radical Republicans in Congress feared that the reconstruction acts would be ruled unconstitutional, so they quickly pushed through a law repealing the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867, barring jurisdiction in pending cases and preventing a clear decision from being rendered by the court.

In the &quot;Slaughter-house cases&quot; Carpenter represented the Crescent City Livestock Landing and Slaughterhouse Company, which had been granted a monopoly on all slaughterhouse business in New Orleans by the carpetbag state legislature of Louisiana in 1869. Butchers and cattle dealers thrown out of work by the law obtained an injunction from a district court, claiming they had been denied equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and deprived of property under the due process clause. Making a plea for states&#x27; rights, Carpenter contended that the amendment had been intended solely to elevate African Americans and had no bearing on economic statutes passed by a state. He also warned of too many powers being centralized in the federal government. The court concurred in Carpenter&#x27;s narrowing of the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment.

In &quot;Bradwell vs. Illinois&quot;, Carpenter sought to broaden the amendment&#x27;s protections in the case of the editor of the Chicago &quot;Legal News&quot;, Myra Bradwell, who had been denied admission to the bar of the Illinois Supreme Court because she was a woman. Representing Bradwell, Carpenter argued that no class of people could be excluded from practicing the legal profession. The federal court disagreed, questioning the propriety of ruling on a state&#x27;s qualifications for admission to the bar.

These cases brought Carpenter handsome fees, national acclaim, and much derision from the losing factions. He&#x27;d also won the support of Stanton and President Ulysses S. Grant, who both urged him to run as a Republican for the U.S. Senate.

==Republican senator==
Following the Civil War Carpenter&#x27;s transformation from a Jeffersonian Democrat into a Republican was complete. Despite reports that he backed President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s policies, he made speeches supporting the Radical congress. He called for the enfranchisement of African-American men and invited members of the Loyal Democracy to join the Republicans, as he himself did in the summer of 1867 with his support for Governor Lucius Fairchild&#x27;s re-election.

With high-profile backing Carpenter ran successfully for the senate seat occupied by James R. Doolittle, a &quot;Johnsonized&quot; Republican who had fallen out of favor with his party. With his victory he solidified his status with the &quot;Madison Regency,&quot; a Republican group that included former governor and Johnson&#x27;s Postmaster General Alexander Randall, Madison postmaster Elisha W. Keyes and &quot;Wisconsin State Journal&quot; editor and Republican state central committee chairman Horace Rublee. After Rublee was appointed minister to Switzerland by President Grant, Keyes became party chairman and closely coordinated with Carpenter to distribute federal patronage jobs to political allies.

Once in the Senate, Carpenter moderated his views to the degree that he became one of the spokesmen of the emerging Stalwart Republicans. He opposed any &quot;fundamental conditions&quot; placed on states wishing to be readmitted to the Union, and favored blanket amnesty for former Confederates. Carpenter was known as one of the staunchest supporters of the Grant administration. In the Senate he presented an unabashed defense of political patronage, mocking the idea of civil service reform. Carpenter would garner a reputation for his oratory skills as a member of the Senate, including with a return to Beloit in 1869. At Beloit College, he gave a foreign policy speech that has been deemed particularly historically significant.

He also feuded with Liberal Republican senators Charles Sumner and Carl Schurz over many issues. He delivered a sarcastic denunciation of Sumner&#x27;s wide-reaching civil rights amendment to the Confederate amnesty bill. As the chair of an investigating committee he also debunked Sumner and Schurz&#x27;s claim that the War Department had broken its neutrality when it sold outmoded rifles to France during the Franco-Prussian War. Despite such skirmishes Carpenter was a respected figure in the senate, being elected president pro tempore by his colleagues in 1871. He also served as chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills (42nd Congress) and the committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expense (42nd and 43rd Congresses).

As part of another committee inquiry, Carpenter went to Louisiana to investigate election claims in order to determine the rightful governor of the contested state. His report was highly critical of both factions, but he urged the recognition of Republican governor William P. Kellogg. Years later Carpenter&#x27;s impartiality was called into question when personal letters revealed a close relationship between the two, including a &quot;desperately short&quot; Carpenter asking Kellogg for a $1,000 loan.

==Drawing fire from press and party==
As Carpenter&#x27;s influence grew within the Grant administration, so did the condemnations from the press. One of his Senate investigations resulted in two journalists being jailed for not divulging the source of a leaked treaty. Opposition newspapers like the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; responded by not only criticizing Carpenter&#x27;s methods, but by also condemning his moral character by bringing his private life into question. Later in his term editors accused Carpenter of trying to effectively &quot;gag&quot; newspapers by advancing a bill that would allow judicial process to be served upon the agents (i.e. interviewers) of persons involved in civil suits.

In 1873 Carpenter angered many in his own party by taking positions that ran counter to the stalwart doctrine. In a spirit of reform he boldly owned up to administration excesses such as the Credit Mobilier and the &quot;Salary Grab,&quot; defending them in a speech in Janesville. In a speech at Ripon he denounced the railroads, insisting they were public highways paid for with government land grants. He also stated his belief that the government has a right as well as a duty to regulate corporations.

Wishing to make the &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; into a more reliable organ for the state Republican party, Carpenter and other backers bought the paper and forced out editor Alexander M. Thomson, who had been instrumental in getting Carpenter elected senator. Thomson was now deemed too critical of the party machine. His ousting made him a lifelong enemy of Carpenter. The &quot;Sentinel&quot; soon was seen as Carpenter&#x27;s personal mouthpiece.

Despite the incessant criticism, Carpenter was seen as being easily re-elected in 1875. Nevertheless, a surprise bolt by disgruntled Republicans combined with votes by calculating Democrats resulted in the election of Angus Cameron, a La Crosse Republican.

==Out of office and under scrutiny==
In 1875 Carpenter was implicated in the Whiskey Ring scandal that funneled federal liquor tax revenues to some states&#x27; Republican parties. Although he was close to key participants in the Milwaukee ring, no evidence emerged to prove his involvement.

During this time Carpenter, along with Jeremiah S. Black and Montgomery Blair, was also defending Grant&#x27;s Secretary of War William W. Belknap against charges that he had accepted money in exchange for the appointment of a post trader. Despite Belknap&#x27;s immediate resignation outraged House Democrats proceeded with his impeachment. Carpenter portrayed Belknap as the hapless victim of a social-climbing wife, but his legal victory relied on his assertion that jurisdiction over Belknap ended with his resignation.

Also in 1875 Carpenter was defense counsel for officials of the Miners’ National Association (MNA) in an important labor case that sought to apply the legal concept of conspiracy to union picketing and organization efforts. The case grew out of a coal miners&#x27; strike in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, which was supported by the MNA, then numerically one of the largest American trade unions. First over fifty of the striking workers were tried upon a charge of criminal conspiracy and thirty-six of them were convicted with some sentenced to jail, although they appeared to have been guilty of no more than peaceful picketing. Then John Siney, the president of the MNA, and Xingo Parks, one of the union&#x27;s best organizers, were tried on the same charge. Siney was acquitted, but Parks convicted, although pardoned shortly thereafter.

Following the disputed presidential election of 1876, Carpenter was hired by supporters of the Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden to examine Louisiana&#x27;s vote counts and argue for victory over Republican Rutherford B. Hayes. Carpenter&#x27;s first-hand accounts of the corrupt Republican state administration gave the Democrats some reason for hope, but ultimately the partisan make-up of the special electoral commission (7 Republicans, 6 Democrats) and its refusal to look behind the certified counts made many of their rulings a forgone conclusive win for Hayes.

==Return to the senate==
Despite ongoing press criticism and declining health, in 1878 Carpenter launched a bid for the senate seat occupied by Republican Timothy Howe. With the help of a strong lobby, he won over enough votes in the legislature to prevail over state party boss (and former friend) Elisha W. Keyes.

Carpenter&#x27;s second term as senator lacked the political drama of his Reconstruction years. He spoke in favor of President Rutherford B. Hayes&#x27;s maintenance of federal troops at southern polling places. He also vigorously opposed the Democrats&#x27; proposed pardoning of General Fitz-John Porter for ignoring General John Pope&#x27;s orders at Manassas in 1863, arguing that the power of pardon resides solely with the president. Carpenter remained a loyal supporter of President Grant in his quest for a third term, igniting bitter debates between Carpenter and White House aspirant Senator James G. Blaine of Maine.

==Death==
While Carpenter&#x27;s evident declining health was attributed to his indulgent lifestyle, he also suffered from the lung congestion of Bright&#x27;s disease. After a cycle of relapses and recoveries he died on February 24, 1881, at his Washington, D.C., home surrounded by friends and family. He was buried at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee.

==Family==
In 1855 Carpenter married Caroline Dillingham, the daughter of Paul Dillingham. They were the parents of four children. Daughters Ada and Annie were born and died in 1860. The other two lived to adulthood—a daughter named Lilian (1857–1942) and a son named Paul Dillingham Carpenter (1867–1932). Paul D. Carpenter was an attorney in Milwaukee and also served as judge of the county court.

<doc id="511917" wikidata="Q2779095" url="?curid=511917" title="Mutual Defense Assistance Act">
<text>The Mutual Defense Assistance Act was a United States Act of Congress signed by President Harry S. Truman on October 6, 1949. For U.S. foreign policy, it was the first U.S. military foreign aid legislation of the Cold War era, and initially to Europe. The Act followed Truman&#x27;s signing of the Economic Cooperation Act (the Marshall Plan), on April 3, 1948, which provided non-military, economic reconstruction and development aid to Europe.

The 1949 Act was amended and reauthorized on July 26, 1950. In 1951, the Economic Cooperation Act and Mutual Defense Assistance Act were succeeded by the Mutual Security Act, and its newly created independent agency, the Mutual Security Administration, to supervise all foreign aid programs, including both military assistance programs and non-military, economic assistance programs that bolstered the defense capability of U.S. allies. 
About the same time, the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951, also known or referred to as the Battle Act, (65 Stat. 644; 22 U.S.C. 1611 et seq.) was also passed; it banned U.S. assistance to countries doing business with the Soviet Union and was so-named after its sponsor, Representative Laurie C. Battle of Alabama. Strong motivation for this &quot;control&quot; act also came from export control concerns, following their tightening by the Export Control Act of 1949 over Soviet advances; export controls were used for both domestic policy and later as an instrument of foreign policy. This is exemplified by the restrictions on export of certain strategic or military items to the Soviet bloc or to other countries which it felt, if permitted, would be detrimental to the foreign policy program of the U.S. This latter motive became so strong that it brought legislation directing the President to enlist the cooperation of other nations in enacting controls on trade with the Soviet bloc to parallel those of the United States. The benefits of the various economic and military aid programs were to be withheld from non-cooperating nations. The act covered a wide range of materials needed for the production of weapons, and was especially focused on anything that could aid atomic weapons research and construction.

As the Cold War developed, these acts were part of the American policy of containment of communism. They importantly provided defense assistance to any ally that might be attacked by the Soviet Union or one of its allies, while other programs provided non-military economic assistance. In Asia, the programs expanded with the newly established Maoist People&#x27;s Republic of China, and other areas, with the development of specific country missions, including ones in Austria (1947–1950), China (1946–1948), Ireland (1948–1951), and Trieste (1947–1952).

==Historical background: the World War II aftermath and the Cold War==

In the immediate aftermath of World War II, Western arsenals experienced significant depletion and wear. Public funds were primarily allocated to reconstruction efforts. Even the U.S. arsenal exhibited noticeable signs of shortages and deterioration.

Military officials began calling for the introduction of a new defense legislation in 1947, arguing that depleted inventories of surplus World War II-vintage armaments, piecemeal planning of new armaments and restrictions on presidential authority threatened current and future efforts to arm allied nations. New legislation became a necessity by mid-1948 with the negotiation of the North Atlantic Treaty and the necessity to provide military aid to strengthen the connectional defenses, having in mind a global resistance to Communist expansion of the signatories.

Truman sent a first bill to Congress on 25 July 1949, the day he ratified the North Atlantic Treaty but congressional opposition forced submission of a new legislation, which specified the recipients and the amounts of assistance. Administration planners believed the MDAA&#x27;s immediate effects would be to raise the morale of friendly nations and prove U.S. reliability and resolve to meet Communist worldwide threats. The MDAA also institutionalized the concept of specific military aid programs, a result ensured by adoption of similar legislation in 1950 and an increase in annual spending on military aid to $5.222 billion after the outbreak of the Korean War - the very first large-scale test of the validity and practicability of the concept, if excepting the logistical support allowed to France during the First Indochina War.

==Mutual Assistance Program==

The Mutual Defense Assistance Act created the &quot;Mutual Defense Assistance Program (MDAP),&quot; which became an integral component in the federal government&#x27;s policy of containment of Soviet expansion. This program differed from the World War II-era Lend-Lease program in that it never needed refunding from the country that benefits any military assistance. Between 1950 and 1967, $33.4 billion in arms and services and $3.3 billion worth of surplus weaponry were provided under the program.

===Europe: NATO===

On 4 April 1949, the foreign ministers from 12 countries signed the North Atlantic Treaty at the Departmental Auditorium in Washington D.C.: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Provision for enlargement was, however, given by Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that membership is open to any &quot;European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area&quot;.

* Belgium and the Netherlands
* Denmark and Norway
* France
:Massive support was negotiated with France from 1950 to 1954 when the French Union fought the Chinese and Soviet-backed Viet Minh during the First Indochina War. Support included substantial financial aid, material supply from the U.S. Army (uniforms, helmets, rifles, tanks), US Navy (aircraft carriers such as &quot;Belleau Wood/Bois Belleau&quot;), the U.S. Air Force (twelve Fairchild C-119, fighters, bombers, and maintenance crews) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) (twenty four pilots of the Civil Air Transport) from which two pilots were killed in action during the battle of Dien Bien Phu.
:American military support to France&#x27;s rearmament lasted well into the 1950s, the French receiving furthermore equipment including M46 Pattons, F-84 Thunderjet, etc. but the divergence between the United States and the Anglo-French alliance during the Suez crisis was to have decisive consequences on France-NATO relationships. Whereas the damage done to Anglo-American relations was quickly repaired, in the case of France, the situation remained more complex. France started to express reservations about the direction of Allied policy and U.S. leadership and, following his election as President in 1958, General Charles de Gaulle, in particular, made clear his dissatisfaction with aspects of this US prominent role, as well as, more specifically, with NATO&#x27;s nuclear policy and NATO Military Command Structure. Although France was one of the very founding members of the Atlantic Alliance, President Charles de Gaulle withdrew France from NATO&#x27;s military structure in 1966 in protest over American dominance of the Atlantic Alliance.

* Germany
* Greece
* Italy
* Portugal
:On 4 April 1949, José Caeiro da Matta, Portuguese Minister for Foreign Affairs, signed the North Atlantic Treaty.
* Spain
* Turkey

===Asia===

* Indochinese Peninsula after independence : Vietnam, Laos, ..
* Iran
* Japan
:On 8 September 1951, the United States and Japan signed the Mutual Security Treaty, which stationed U.S. troops on Japanese soil for the defense of Japan following the eruption of the Korean War. On 8 March 1954, both countries signed the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement (activated on 1 May 1954), focusing on defense assistance. It allowed for the presence of U.S. armed forces in Japan for the purpose of peace and security while encouraging Japan to take on more responsibility for its own defense, rearming in a manner suited for defensive purposes.

*Pakistan:
During the Korean War, Pakistan sided with the West in their fight against communism. By joining the CENTO &amp; SEATO alliances, Pakistan officially became a Major non-NATO ally of the US under which it received aid financially and militarily through the Mutual Defense Assistance program to defend herself from Afghanistan and India which were being supported by the Soviets. 

===Nonaligned countries===
The MDAA caused both a great deal of friction with the non-aligned countries and opportunities to tighten geopolitical relations with the western free world and especially the United States.

* India
:India refused to accept any American-imposed limits on its trade and proceeded with shipments of Thorium nitrate to China. Realizing that cutting off all aid to India would do more harm than good, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles negotiated a solution.

* Indonesia
* Yugoslavia:
:see references 
:Up to the early 1960s, the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) had a large arsenal of German equipment, planes, and armor captured during the war, western materiel donated by the USA and Great Britain during the war, as well as Soviet equipment.
:Despite Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s firm adherence to communism, because of the ideological and personal conflict with Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Union—and thereafter all the Warsaw Pact&#x27;s pro-Soviet governments—denounced his treaty of friendship with Yugoslavia on September 27, 1949. During this period, Yugoslavia perceived a serious threat of intervention by its former allies and thus accepted American and British offers of assistance. Discussions even took place regarding Yugoslavia&#x27;s possible inclusion in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Consequently, the Yugoslav armed forces received standard NATO military equipment and arms during this period, such as the F-86 Sabre and F-84 Thunderjet jet fighters, and M36 Jackson and M18 Hellcat tank destroyers.After Stalin&#x27;s death and the political and ideological reconciliation with the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army later exclusively imported their equipment from the USSR when not sourcing it internally.

<text>USS &quot;O&#x27;Hare&quot; (DD/DDR-889) was a of the United States Navy in commission from 1945 to 1973. She was named for Lieutenant Commander Edward &quot;Butch&quot; O&#x27;Hare, Medal of Honor recipient, who was shot down during the Battle of Tarawa on 27 November 1943.

After the conclusion of her U.S. Navy service, &quot;O&#x27;Hare&quot; was transferred to Spain, where she served in the Spanish Navy from 1973 to 1992 as &quot;Méndez Núñez&quot; (D63).

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;O&#x27;Hare&quot; was laid down at the Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas, on 27 January 1945. She was launched on 22 June 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Selma O&#x27;Hare, the mother of Lieutenant Commander Edard &quot;Butch&quot; O&#x27;Hare, and commissioned on 29 November 1945.

==Service history==

===1946–1963===
In February 1946, following shakedown, &quot;O&#x27;Hare&quot; became an active unit of the U.S. Navy. After spending 1946 in operations ranging from New Brunswick down to the Florida Keys, she embarked her first group of midshipmen for a cruise to Latin America during the summer of 1947. Departing Norfolk, Virginia, early in May 1948 she sailed to the Mediterranean temporarily serving under the United Nations&#x27; flag as an evacuation ship off Haifa, Israel, from 24 June through July, during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Several goodwill visits took place before departure for home in September at the conclusion of this first deployment with the Sixth Fleet.

Eight additional such tours of duty, prior to the end of 1962, permitted ship&#x27;s company to gain a great deal of familiarity with the area. Midshipman cruises and NATO maneuvers added new vistas and dimensions to her training exercises as did several rescue operations. Twice in 1952 this destroyer received commendations for her efforts after ships had collided at sea, while in 1957 and again in 1961 aviators from the carriers and respectively were plucked from the sea. Meanwhile, to update and increase her value to the Navy, &quot;O&#x27;Hare&quot; was converted during 1953 to a radar picket ship (DDR-889) and in 1958 received installation of the electronic data system. The next major modification, in 1963, a FRAM Mk I overhaul, restored her original designation.

===1963–1973===
The increasing tempo and scope of the Vietnam War brought &quot;O&#x27;Hare&quot; an assignment to WestPac duty. Steaming from Norfolk, on 1 June 1966, she assumed station as a gun support ship along the coast of Vietnam on 15 July, firing missions in all four Corps areas in the South. &quot;O&#x27;Hare&quot; served as plane guard for aircraft carriers on &quot;Yankee Station&quot; in the Gulf of Tonkin, participated in &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; operations, patrolled on search and rescue duties off North Vietnam. &quot;O&#x27;Hare&quot; returned home on 17 December via the Suez Canal, completing a circumnavigation of the world. In March 1968, along with from Mayport, &quot;O&#x27;Hare&quot; deployed to the Indian Ocean via Africa and made 17 port calls in the Middle East. In January 1969 with Destroyer Squadron 32 (DesRon 32) she again deployed to the Mediterranean.

&quot;O&#x27;Hare&quot; deployed to Vietnam on 1 December 1972, remaining on gunfire support duty there until the cease fire of March 1973. She then became the last U.S. Navy ship based on the United States East Coast to circumnavigate the world after a Vietnam deployment during her return to the United States. She became a &quot;blue-nosed&quot; ship during the voyage when she crossed the Arctic Circle on 17 September 1972, and passed through the Panama Canal on 6 December 1972.

&quot;O&#x27;Hare&quot; was decommissioned on 31 October 1973, and transferred on loan to the Spanish Navy. The ship was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 2 June 1975.

== &quot;Méndez Núñez&quot; (D-63) ==

&quot;O&#x27;Hare&quot; was sold outright to Spain on 17 May 1978. In the Spanish Navy, she served as &quot;Méndez Núñez&quot; (D-63), in honor of Vice Admiral Casto Méndez Núñez (1824–1869), and was the third ship in Spanish navy with this name.

&quot;Méndez Núñez&quot; was stricken and scrapped in 1992.

<text>Lake Ngami is an endorheic lake in Botswana, north of the Kalahari Desert. It is seasonally filled by the Taughe River, an effluent of the Okavango River system flowing out of the western side of the Okavango Delta. It is one of the fragmented remnants of the ancient Lake Makgadikgadi. Although the lake has shrunk dramatically beginning from 1890, it remains an important habitat for birds and wildlife, especially in flood years.

== Visits ==
Lake Ngami had many famous visitors during the 19th (and into the 20th) century. In 1849 David Livingstone described it as a &quot;shimmering lake, some long and 20 [30 km] wide&quot;. Livingstone also made a few cultural notes about the people living in this area; he noticed they had a story similar to that of the Tower of Babel, except that the builders&#x27; heads were &quot;cracked by the fall of the scaffolding&quot; (&quot;Missionary Travels&quot;, chap. 26).

One of the illustrations is known to have been made on the basis of a sketch by Mr. Alfred Ryder (1825-1850) son of Artist, William Mills Rider (1795 - 1841), a young Englishman who had visited the Lake Ngami just a few months before Livingstone arrived there. He had died on his way back. Ryder had made a sketch of the lake and although it was left unfinished, Livingstone persuaded Mrs. Ryder to lend it for the illustration of his book.8 Besides carefully copying the lake scenery, the artist employed by Murray was asked to add a family group into the picture to make it more suitable for Livingstone&#x27;s purposes.

Charles John Andersson (who published &quot;Lake Ngami; or, Explorations and Discoveries during Four Years&#x27; Wanderings in the Wilds of Southwestern Africa&quot; in 1856) and Frederick Thomas Green also visited the area in the early 1850s. Frederick Lugard led a British expedition to the lake in 1896. Arnold Weinholt Hodson passed through the area on his journey from Serowe to Victoria Falls in 1906.

Ngami Lacuna, a methane lake on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan, is named after this lake.

<text>4 Canadian Division Support Base Petawawa, commonly referred to as Garrison Petawawa, is located in Petawawa, Ontario. It is operated as an army base by the Canadian Army.

==Current use==

The Garrison is located in the Ottawa Valley in Renfrew County, northwest of Ottawa along the western bank of the Ottawa River. Its main gate is North of the town of Petawawa. The majority of the base territory is in the municipality of Laurentian Hills, with portions also in Petawawa and Deep River.

As of March 2022, the approximate personnel numbers are as follows:

* Canadian Forces personnel: 6,000
* DND civilian employees: 1,000
* Canadian Forces dependents: 5,653

Approximately 6,000 people directly connected to the base live in local communities between Deep River and Pembroke.

The Garrison has an extensive infrastructure with 465 buildings and over 300 km2 of property comprising the Petawawa Training Area.

===Fitness facilities===

Dundonald Hall is the Garrison&#x27;s main fitness facility and is located on Festubert Boulevard. It houses a 5,000 square metre field house containing a 200-metre indoor running track, a 25-metre swimming pool, a wading pool equipped with a winding water slide, and whirlpool and sauna facilities.

The complex houses a gymnasium, aerobic studio, teen room, preschool play rooms and meeting rooms. The &quot;Rec Plex&quot; is home to numerous clubs and societies on the base such as the Karate Club, Preschool Clubs and the Indoor Rock Climbing Club.

===Recreation===

The South Side Community Centre offers similar facilities and services to another area of the Petawawa community, including Recreation Service&#x27;s and Military Family Resources Services.

During the summer, recreation options include golf on the base&#x27;s 18-hole course, hiking local trails, beaches on local lakes and rivers, a full service marina for sail and power boating on the Ottawa River, or camping along the banks of the Ottawa River.

Winter recreation options include cross country ski trails, snowmobiling and ice fishing.

==History==
Founded in 1905 as the Petawawa Military Camp, or Camp Petawawa, the Garrison was created by the Department of Militia and Defence upon the purchase of of mostly agricultural property from local residents.

The Garrison derives its name from the Petawawa River. The origin of the name PETAWAWA is lost in antiquity, but legend has it that it is an Algonquian Native-Aboriginal word pronounced PETWEWE. The translation is thought to mean, &quot;Where one hears noise like this&quot;, referring to the sound of the fast water over the rocks in the river. In another legend it is said that the area was named after an indigenous woman who inhabited the banks of the Petawawa River and lived to the age of 115 years.

Early French explorers used a trail or route through this area. The Mattawa Trail, now called Mattawa Road still exists on parts of the base today. The site was originally a German immigrant settlement. German pioneers toiled to build a community out of the harsh and rugged terrain. Some of the topographical features in the training area still bear the names of these early settlers.

By 1904 the Department of Militia and Defence purchased 150 properties from these settlers totaling . The Royal Canadian Horse and Garrison Artillery were the first to train at Petawawa Military Camp during the summer of 1905. In 1906 the Royal Canadian Engineers constructed huts, stables and installed water and gas systems. In that same year &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; Batteries of the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, commenced the first of many marches to Camp Petawawa for summer training from their permanent station in Kingston, Ontario.

By 1907 combined training and tactical exercises were conducted by various other units such as A and B Squadron, Royal Canadian Dragoons; A and B Batteries, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery; No. 2 Company, Royal Canadian Engineers; a battalion from The Royal Canadian Regiment; and detachments from the Medical and Ordnance Corps.

The first military aircraft flight in Canada took place at Petawawa. On 31 July 1909 under perfect weather conditions, J.A.D. McCurdy and F.W. Baldwin flew the &quot;Silver Dart&quot; at Camp Petawawa in the presence of military observers.

From December 1914 to May 1916, Petawawa was used as an internment camp for 750 German and Austrian prisoners of World War I. Most of these men were civilian internees, the majority of them Ukrainians and other Europeans who came to the Dominion from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and so were categorized as &quot;enemy aliens&quot; at the outbreak of the war. At the same time Canada Car and Foundry Company had developed three inch shells and were being tested at the camp by Russian artillery. The prisoners, in effect forced labourers, were instrumental in helping clear roads and timber opening up an artillery range and so making these tests possible. From May 1916 to 1918, 10,767 Canadian troops were trained at Petawawa before being sent overseas.

The Garrison is also home to a marked grave of a member of the Chinese Labour Corps, Chou Ming Shan, whom died in transit in France in 1917 and buried at the base. Commonwealth War Graves Commission installed an official grave marker in 2019.

During World War II, three training centres (two artillery and one engineering) were established at Camp Petawawa. In September 1942, 12,515 troops were stationed on the base. The peak load was reached during 1943 when approximately 20,000 troops were undergoing training at one time. As in the previous war, Petawawa was the site of an internment camp. The camp&#x27;s official designation was Internment Camp No.33; located at Centre Lake it held 645 civilian internees. There were 28 different nationalities, the majority being Italian and German people identified as enemy aliens.

In 1947, the training of militia and regular units of the Canadian Army resumed. The Royal Canadian Dragoons and 1st Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment were moved to Camp Petawawa in 1948. Upon being given the status of a permanent camp, it was officially designated &quot;Camp Petawawa&quot; in May 1951. During the next few years construction continued in order to accommodate more regular units, married quarters and schools for the soldiers&#x27; dependents. Units of the Special Force, such as 2 RCHA, 8th Hussars, PPCLI, and 1 RCR earmarked for service in Korea were concentrated at Petawawa before transferring to the United States for departure to the Korean Theatre. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade Group was stationed to Petawawa upon return from Germany in 1959. This formation was redesignated 2 Combat Group in 1966.

The unification of the Canadian Forces resulted in Camp Petawawa being renamed Canadian Forces Base Petawawa (CFB Petawawa) on February 1, 1968. Under the CF, the base was allocated to Mobile Command.

On 1 April 1977, 2 Combat Group was disbanded. 2 Combat Group combined with the Canadian Airborne Regiment at CFB Petawawa to form the Special Service Force. The Special Service Force constituted a unique chapter in Canada&#x27;s military history. It derived its name from the first Special Service Force, an historic formation of Americans and Canadians which pioneered special forces operations in a brief but immensely successful history during the second world war. The latter-day Special Service Force represented a compromise between the general purpose combat capabilities of a normal brigade and the strategic and tactical flexibility which derived from the lighter and more mobile capabilities of the Canadian Airborne Regiment. Units and soldiers of the Special Service Force served in operations both at home and around the world.

The Special Service Force was officially re-designated as 2 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group by a Ministerial Order signed on 24 April 1995. This decision to re-organize and re-equip the formation was due to current emphasis in Canadian defence policy on general-purpose capabilities. With a smaller force structure, a smaller defence budget and more frequent operational taskings, it has become clear that general-purpose capabilities provide the best return on Canada&#x27;s investment in defence. Accordingly, 2 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group of Petawawa has been designed to be a mirror image of its two sister formations, 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, based in Edmonton, Alberta and 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, based in Valcartier, Quebec.

Barracks Building F-16 (constructed in 1953) was designated a Recognized Federal Heritage Building in 1995, due to its association with the efforts of the Canadian Armed Forces to meet Canada&#x27;s post-World War II international commitments, and due to its modern classicist architecture common among federal buildings of the period.

===Recent===

Currently there are approximately 6,100 persons employed at 4 CDSB Petawawa (5,100 of them military) who are included in the units of 2 CMBG, Garrison Petawawa and lodger units. Soldiers at Garrison Petawawa have been involved in many operations throughout the world including tours in Afghanistan and Bosnia.

In 2005, 4 CDSB Petawawa celebrated its first 100 years of service. A number of events were planned in conjunction with units and the local communities to commemorate this special occasion.

In 2021, during the COVID-19 Pandemic, the base deployed medical military personnel to Cross Lake, to help organize a response to an outbreak in the Pimicikamak population.

==Current operations==

Garrison Petawawa is the home of the 4th Canadian Division Support Group and 2 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, which is made up of:

<doc id="511925" wikidata="Q1723857" url="?curid=511925" title="USS Jacob Jones (DD-61)">
<text>USS &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; (Destroyer No. 61/DD-61) was a built for the United States Navy prior to the American entry into World War I. The ship was the first U.S. Navy vessel named in honor of Jacob Jones.

&quot;Jacob Jones&quot; was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding of Camden, New Jersey, in August 1914 and launched in May of the following year. The ship was a little more than in length, just over abeam, and had a standard displacement of . She was armed with four guns and had eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; was powered by a pair of steam turbines that propelled her at up to .

After her February 1916 commissioning, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; conducted patrols off the New England coast. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; was sent overseas. Patrolling the Irish Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; rescued the survivors of several ships, picking up over 300 from the sunken Armed merchant cruiser .

On 6 December, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; was steaming independently from Brest, France, for Queenstown, when she was torpedoed and sunk by German submarine with the loss of 66 men, becoming the first United States destroyer sunk by enemy action. &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; sank in eight minutes without issuing a distress call; the German submarine commander, &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Hans Rose, after taking two badly injured &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; crewmen aboard his submarine, radioed the U.S. base at Queenstown with the coordinates for the survivors. The Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Dedham, Massachusetts is named for the ship.

== Design and construction ==
&quot;Jacob Jones&quot; was authorized in 1913 as the fifth ship of the which, like the related , was an improved version of the s authorized in 1911. Construction of the vessel was awarded to New York Shipbuilding of Camden, New Jersey, which laid down her keel on 3 August 1914. Ten months later, on 29 May 1915, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; was launched by sponsor Mrs. Jerome Parker Crittenden (née &quot;Paulina Cazenove Jones&quot;), a great-granddaughter of the ship&#x27;s namesake, Commodore Jacob Jones (1768–1850), a U.S. Navy officer during the War of 1812. As built, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; was in length and abeam and drew . The ship had a standard displacement of and displaced when fully loaded.

&quot;Jacob Jones&quot; had two Curtis steam turbines that drove her two screw propellers, and an additional steam turbine geared to one of the propeller shafts for cruising purposes. The power plant could generate and move the ship at speeds up to .

&quot;Jacob Jones&quot;″ main battery consisted of four /50 Mark 9 guns, with each gun weighing in excess of . The guns fired armor-piercing projectiles at . At an elevation of 20°, the guns had a range of .

&quot;Jacob Jones&quot; was also equipped with eight torpedo tubes. The General Board of the United States Navy had called for two anti-aircraft guns for the &quot;Tucker&quot;-class ships, as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines. From sources, it is unclear if these recommendations were followed for &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; or any of the other ships of the class.

== United States Navy career ==
USS &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; was commissioned into the United States Navy on 10 February 1916 under the command of Lieutenant Commander William S. Pye. Following her commissioning, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; conducted training exercises off the New England coast, and then entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard for repairs. On 3 Feb. 1917, the day the United States broke diplomatic relations with Germany, the ship nearly sank in the naval yard. Contemporary reports said it might have been an act of sabotage. Upon the United States&#x27; entry into World War I on 6 April 1917, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; patrolled off the coast of Virginia. She sailed from Boston for Europe on 7 May with a group of destroyers that included , and arrived at Queenstown, Ireland, on 17 May.

&quot;Jacob Jones&quot;″ duties at Queenstown involved patrolling and escorting convoys in the Irish Sea and making occasional rescues of survivors of sunken ships. On 8 July, was torpedoed by German submarine some west of Fastnet Rock; &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; arrived on the scene and picked up 44 survivors of the British steamship. While escorting British steamship two weeks later, lookouts on &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; sighted a periscope, but before the destroyer could make an attack on the submarine, torpedoed and sank the steamship. &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; was able to take on 26 of &quot;Dafila&quot;″s 28-member crew after the ship went down.

On 19 October, the British Armed merchant cruiser and ten destroyers, including &quot;Jacob Jones&quot;, were escorting an eastbound convoy of twenty steamers, when German submarine surfaced in the midst of the group. The submarine launched its only remaining torpedo at &quot;Orama&quot;, sinking that vessel. While sister ship saw and depth charged &quot;U-62&quot; (to no avail), &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; turned her attentions to rescuing &quot;Orama&quot;″s survivors, gathering 309.

== Sinking ==
In early December, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; helped escort a convoy to Brest, France, with five other Queenstown-based destroyers. The last to depart from Brest on the return to Ireland, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; was steaming alone in a zig-zag pattern when she was spotted by &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Hans Rose on the German submarine . At 16:20 on 6 December 1917, near position , lookouts on &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; spotted a torpedo distant headed for the ship&#x27;s starboard side. Despite having her rudder put hard left and emergency speed rung up, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; was unable to move out of the way, and the torpedo struck her rudder. Even though her depth charges did not explode, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; was adrift. The jolt had knocked out power, so the destroyer was unable to send a distress signal; since she was steaming alone, no other ship was present to know of &quot;Jacob Jones&quot;″ predicament.

Commander David W. Bagley, the destroyer&#x27;s commander, ordered all life rafts and boats launched. As the ship sank, her bow raised in the air almost vertically before she began to slip beneath the waves. At this point the armed depth charges began to explode, killing men who had been unable to escape the destroyer, and stunning many others in the water. The destroyer, the first United States destroyer ever lost to enemy action, sank eight minutes after the torpedo struck the rudder, taking with her two officers and 64 men.

Several of the crew—most notably Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Stanton F. Kalk, the officer-of-the-deck when the torpedo struck—began to get men out of the water and into the life rafts. Kalk worked in the cold Atlantic water to equalize the load among the various rafts, but died of exhaustion and exposure.

Bagley noted in his official account that about 30 minutes after &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; sank, the German submarine surfaced about two to three miles from the collection of rafts and took one of the American sailors on board. According to Uboat.net, what Rose of &quot;U-53&quot; had done was surface and take aboard two badly injured American sailors. Rose had also radioed the American base at Queenstown with the approximate coordinates of the sinking before departing the area.

Bagley, unaware of Rose&#x27;s humanitarian gesture, left most of the food, water, and medical supplies with Lieutenant Commander John K. Richards, whom he left in charge of the assembled rafts. Bagley, Lieutenant Commander Norman Scott (&quot;Jacob Jones&quot;″ executive officer) and four crewmen (brought along to row), set out for aid in the nearby Isles of Scilly. At 13:00 on 7 December, Bagley&#x27;s group was sighted by a British patrol vessel just six nautical miles (11 km) from their destination. The group was relieved to find that the British sloop had found and taken aboard most of the survivors earlier that morning; a small group had been rescued on the night of the sinking by the American steamer .

Several men were recognized for their actions in the aftermath of the torpedo attack. Kalk (posthumously) and Bagley received the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. Others honored included Chief Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Harry Gibson (posthumously) and Chief Electrician&#x27;s Mate L. J. Kelly, who both received the Navy Cross; and Richards, Scott, and Chief Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Charles Charlesworth all received letters of commendation. Rose was awarded the Pour le Mérite and Ritterkreuz des Hohenzollerschen Hausordens mit Schwertern for this and other achievements in the tonnage war.

==Wreck==

On August 11, 2022, British deep-sea divers located the wreck of &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; off the Isles of Scilly at a depth of . Numerous artifacts were located, including the ship&#x27;s bell. The divers, who found the bell lying on its side, flipped it upright and photographed and filmed it.

On 15 January 2024, the British Ministry of Defence used an underwater robotic vehicle to salvage the ship&#x27;s bell at the request of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Naval History and Heritage Command. The inscriptions &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; and &quot;1915&quot; were still visible on the bell, and its clapper was still in place. The bell was placed in the custody of Wessex Archaeology in Salisbury, England, with plans calling for it to be sent to the Naval History and Heritage Command&#x27;s underwater archaeology unit at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. The bell was transferred to the U.S. Navy in a handover ceremony on 20 May 2024.

<doc id="511966" wikidata="Q715705" url="?curid=511966" title="Potnia Theron">
<text>The Potnia Theron (, ) or Mistress of Animals is a widespread motif in ancient art from the Mediterranean world and the ancient Near East, showing a central human, or human-like, female figure who grasps two animals, one to each side. Although the connections between images and concepts in the various ancient cultures concerned remain very unclear, such images are often referred to by the Greek term &quot;Potnia Theron&quot; regardless of culture of origin.

The term is first used once by Homer as a descriptor of Artemis and often used to describe female divinities associated with animals. The word &quot;Potnia&quot;, meaning mistress or lady, was a Mycenaean Greek word inherited by Classical Greek, with the same meaning, cognate to Sanskrit &quot;.&quot;

The oldest such depiction, the Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük, is a clay sculpture from Çatalhöyük in modern Turkey, made c 6,000 BC. This motif is more common in later Near Eastern and Mesopotamian art with a male figure, called the Master of Animals.
Homer&#x27;s mention of &quot;Potnia Theron&quot; refers to Artemis; Walter Burkert describes this mention as &quot;a well established formula&quot;. An Artemis-type deity, a &quot;Mistress of the Animals&quot;, is often assumed to have existed in prehistoric religion and often referred to as &quot;Potnia Theron&quot; with some scholars positing a relationship between Artemis and goddesses depicted in Minoan art.

An early example of Italian &quot;Potnia theròn&quot; is in the Museo civico archeologico di Monte Rinaldo in Italy: a plate illustrates a goddess that wears a long dress and holds hands with two lionesses.

In the Aeneid, Virgil mentions that within Psychro&#x27;s Cave, in Crete, there lived the goddess Cybele whose chariot was drawn by two lions.

<doc id="511979" wikidata="Q1894476" url="?curid=511979" title="William Proxmire">
<text>Edward William Proxmire (November 11, 1915 – December 15, 2005) was an American politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a United States Senator from Wisconsin from 1957 to 1989. He holds the record for being the longest-serving senator from Wisconsin.

Known as a political maverick and an aggressive critic of wasteful government spending, Proxmire invented and awarded the tongue-in-cheek Golden Fleece Award to appropriations he found particularly egregious. He was a member of the Senate Banking Committee, the Senate Appropriations Committee, and the Joint Economic Committee. On the Joint Economic Committee, he exposed numerous instances of wasteful spending on military programs such as the C-5 aircraft and the F-16 fighter, as well as other government programs such as the development of a supersonic transport airplane (SST).

==Early life==
The son of Dr. Theodore Stanley Proxmire, a Chicago-area surgeon, and Adele (Flanigan) Proxmire, Edward William Proxmire was born in Lake Forest, Illinois, on November 11, 1915. He later used &quot;William&quot; rather than &quot;Edward&quot; out of admiration for actor William S. Hart. He graduated from The Hill School (in Pottstown, Pennsylvania) in 1933, Yale University in 1938 (B.A.), Harvard Business School in 1940 (M.B.A.), and Harvard Graduate School of Public Administration in 1948 (M.P.A.). While at Yale, Proxmire joined the Chi Psi fraternity. During 1940 and 1941 Proxmire was a student clerk at J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and studied public speaking at Columbia University.

During World War II he joined the United States Army as a private, and advanced through the ranks to master sergeant. Proxmire later received a commission in the Military Intelligence branch. Most of his service involved counterintelligence work in the Chicago area, where members of his unit investigated individuals suspected of subversive activity. He served from 1941 to 1946, and was discharged as a first lieutenant. While in the Army, Proxmire also continued to study public speaking at Northwestern University. After discharge, he was an executive trainee at J. P. Morgan before returning to Harvard.

After getting his second master&#x27;s degree while working as a teaching fellow at Harvard, Proxmire moved to Wisconsin to be a reporter for &quot;The Capital Times&quot; in Madison and to advance his political career in a favorable state. &quot;They fired me after I&#x27;d been there seven months, for labor activities and impertinence,&quot; he once said. When he ran successfully for the state legislature in 1950, Proxmire was working as the business manager of the &quot;Union Labor News&quot;, a publication of the Madison Federation of Labor.

==Wisconsin State Assembly==
Proxmire served as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly from 1951 to 1953. During his Assembly service, Proxmire was one of few members who maintained a perfect attendance record, a trait that he later continued in the U.S. Senate. While in the Assembly, he was employed as president of Artcraft Press of Waterloo. Proxmire was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Wisconsin in 1952, 1954 and 1956.

==U.S. Senator==
In August 1957, Proxmire won the special election to fill the remainder of the U.S. Senate term vacated by the May 2, 1957 death of Joseph McCarthy. After assuming his seat, Proxmire did not pay the customary tribute to his predecessor and stated instead that McCarthy was a &quot;disgrace to Wisconsin, to the Senate, and to America.&quot;

Proxmire was reelected in 1958, 1964, 1970, 1976 and 1982; all but his 1964 win were by wide margins, including 71 percent of the vote in 1970, 73 percent in 1976 and 65 percent in 1982. In both of his last two campaigns, Proxmire refused contributions and spent less than $200 out of his own pocket, which covered the expenses related to filing re-election paperwork, and he mailed back unsolicited contributions. He was an early advocate of campaign finance reform. Throughout his Senate career, Proxmire also refused to accept reimbursements for travel expenses related to his official duties.

===Consecutive roll call votes===
Proxmire holds the U.S. Senate record for consecutive roll call votes cast: 10,252 between April 20, 1966, and October 18, 1988. In doing so, he surpassed the previous record of 2,941, which was held by Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine. In January 2016, Chuck Grassley broke Proxmire&#x27;s record for longest amount of time between missed votes, but during his time without missing a roll call, Grassley had cast about 3,000 fewer votes than Proxmire.

===Committee memberships===
Proxmire served as the chair of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs from 1975 to 1981 and again from 1987 to 1989. During his first tenure in this position, Proxmire was instrumental in devising the financial plan that saved New York City from bankruptcy in 1976–77. Proxmire&#x27;s subcommittee memberships included Financial Institutions, Housing and Urban Affairs, and International Finance and Monetary Policy.

In addition to his work on the Banking Committee, Proxmire rose through seniority to become a high-ranking member of the Appropriations Committee and was active on several subcommittees, including Defense, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Related Agencies, and Postal Service and Related Agencies.

===Issues and legislation===
In October 1961, Proxmire issued a statement opposing a planned $22 million renovation of the U.S. Capitol by arguing that a &quot;large part of the space created by the extension&quot; would be used &quot;to house private hideaway offices&quot; for 23 senators. Proxmire continued to oppose the renovation, and the debate continued until the project was completed in the early 1970s.

In March 1964, Proxmire charged that political concerns, not national defense needs, were keeping too many naval shipyards open, which resulted in a waste of federal funds: &quot;On the basis of every statistical study, both by the Navy and independent groups, private shipyards can build, repair or modernize five ships for the same number of dollars needed to turn out four ships in navy shipyards.&quot; Proxmire unsuccessfully favored proposals that awarded contracts to the lowest bidder to save money and close unneeded facilities, and he pointed out that &quot;the advantages of this free enterprise approach&quot; had been recognized by Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defense and a former corporate chief executive officer.

From 1967 to 1986, Proxmire gave daily speeches noting the necessity of ratifying the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. He gave that speech every day that the Senate was in session for 20 years, for a total of 3,211 times. On February 11, 1986 the U.S. Senate ratified the convention.

In March 1969, Proxmire introduced legislation that would have regulated the credit life and disability insurance industries. He declared that Americans were being overcharged $220 million a year.

Proxmire was an early and outspoken critic of the Vietnam War and frequently criticized Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. On the Senate Armed Services Committee, he exposed wasteful military spending and was instrumental in blocking military pork barrel projects. Despite his support of budgetary restraint, he regularly sided with dairy interests and supported dairy price supports.

Proxmire was head of the campaign to cancel the American supersonic transport and particularly opposed to space exploration and ultimately to eliminate spending on such research from NASA&#x27;s budget. In response to a segment about space colonies run by the CBS program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Proxmire stated that; &quot;it&#x27;s the best argument yet for chopping NASA&#x27;s funding to the bone... I say not a penny for this nutty fantasy.&quot; Proxmire introduced an amendment into the 1982 NASA budget that effectively terminated NASA&#x27;s nascent SETI efforts before a similar amendment to the 1994 budget, by Senator Richard Bryan, terminated NASA&#x27;s SETI efforts for good. With those positions, Proxmire drew the enmity of many space advocates and science fiction fandom. Arthur C. Clarke attacked Proxmire in his short story &quot;Death and the Senator&quot; (1960) . Later, the short story &quot;The Return of William Proxmire&quot; (1989) by Larry Niven and the novel &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; (1991), written by Niven, Jerry Pournelle, and Michael F. Flynn, were directed against the senator.

In May 1971, Proxmire charged the Food and Drug Administration with violating federal law by authorizing residues of a cancer‐inducing hormone to come into contact with consumers, asserted the move to be in violation of the Delaney amendment in the Food Additives Amendment of 1958, and called for an immediate ban on Diethylstilbestrol.

In September 1971, Proxmire asserted the safety margin of the C‐5A cargo plane was threatened in spite of doubling costs and charged the US Air Force with not disclosing information on the costs to Congress.

In 1972, Proxmire urged the Air Force to recall General John D. Lavelle to active duty for the purpose of court-martial. Lavelle had been forced to retire as a major general due to alleged misconduct concerning Vietnam War bombing missions while he served as commander of Seventh Air Force. Lavelle was not recalled or court-martialed, and in 2007, newly-declassified and released information exonerated Lavelle by showing that President Richard M. Nixon had authorized the bombing missions.

In November 1973, after Attorney General Elliot Richardson resigned, and Robert Bork took over as Acting Attorney General, Proxmire wrote in a letter that Bork was serving illegally as Acting Attorney General since 30 days had passed with him being in office and not having a confirmation by the Senate. He said that any actions taken by Bork in the period after the 39 had passed could be met by challenge, and he called on President Nixon to rectify the situation. Assistant Attorney General Robert G. Dixon Jr. disputed Proxmire&#x27;s claim by saying that similar occurrences of Acting Attorneys General that went over 30 days without Senate confirmations had happened six times earlier.

In January 1977, Proxmire was one of five Democrats to vote against Griffin Bell, President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s nominee for United States Attorney General.

In January 1978, Carter wrote Proxmire on the responsibilities of New York City denizens in his plan to have the city avoid bankruptcy. In April, after New York Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jacob Javits introduced a Carter administration bill that would provide New York City with $2 billion in loan guarantees, Javits stated that he did not believe Proxmire would try killing the measure by bottling it up in committee.

In May, Proxmire announced his willingness to hold hearings on continued federal aid to New York City prior to municipal labor unions having their contracts negotiated and that the Senate Banking Committee would wait as long as possible to secure information on the labor settlement&#x27;s impact. Proxmire stated it was not aware of when the labor contracts would reach a settlement, and the potentially-years-long process could prevent the Senate Banking Committee from taking any action. June 1978 had four days of scheduled hearings by the Senate Banking Committee on continued federal aid to New York City. After the June 6 hearing, Proxmire stated he had maintained an open mind in spite of leaning toward opposition, a shift from his prior position of unwavering disagreement with continued aid and that he was not against a favorable vote on the legislation by the Banking Committee that would authorize the remainder of the Senate to consider the subject. He admitted that the committee was split in the opinions of its members. Days afterward, Proxmire told reporters that the labor bill&#x27;s continued filibuster made the chances of the Senate acting on the legislation by the end of the month unlikely since unanimous consent was required to end the filibuster. Later that month, along with Texas Republican John Tower and Utah Republican Jake Garn, Proxmire was one of the three senators voting against reporting out the bill authorizing $1.5 billion of long‐term loan guarantees for New York City. Proxmire added that he believed that the measure would pass through the Senate in a similar manner to the panel vote.

In February 1978, after President Carter nominated G. William Miller for Chair of the Federal Reserve, Proxmire was noted to be a reliable source of contention but predicted from the start of his confirmation process that Miller would meet little opposition. At the end of the month, eleven members of the Senate Banking Committee pressed for a confirmation of Miller as Federal Reserve Chair, a motion that Proxmire rejected while he was scheduling the vote for another day, and he admitted that the nomination would be easily confirmed by the panel and the full chamber. On March 2, Proxmire cast the sole dissenting vote against the Miller nomination and called him unqualified for the office since he was without experience in economic or monetary affairs.
Proxmire acknowledged Miller&#x27;s business success and was joined by ranking Republican, Edward W. Brooke, in indicating that the Carter administration had influenced members of the panel to hasten the confirmation process. When Miller was later nominated as Secretary of the Treasury in August 1979, Proxmire was once again the only senator to oppose confirmation. He claimed to base his vote on Miller&#x27;s &quot;unwillingness to open a full-scale investigation of allegations that Textron, the company he once headed, paid bribes to numerous foreign officials while Mr. Miller was in charge.&quot; Proxmire acknowledged a lack of evidence to show that Miller had been personally involved in bribes.

In February 1978, Proxmire said that the Navy and the Air Force had spent &quot;at least $42,000 in the last year transporting 3,500 local community leaders to 31 military bases to lobby for military programs&quot; and labeled the trips an example of local citizens being lobbied for military programs. Proxmire added that the trips had included the Air Force favoring production of the B‐1 bomber and gave an estimate cost of 42,000, as the Air Force had turned down on specifying the price.

In February 1979, Proxmire sent a letter to Secretary of the Treasury W. Michael Blumenthal to call on the Treasury Department to withhold federal loan guarantees from New York City until incumbent Mayor Ed Koch agreed to larger cuts in the budget for the following year. He charged the budgetary assumptions of the city as being too reliant on federal aid increases.
In March, Proxmire sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chair Miller on his reservations on the establishment of a free trade zone to allow international banking activity in New York City and advocated for the proposal to be first submitted to Congress, as opposed to unilateral regulatory action.

In October 1979, Proxmire wrote head of the General Accounting Office Elmer B. Staats to request the GAO to investigate claims that the Department of Housing and Urban Development had authorized the P.I. Properties to steal funds from the federal government and low income tenants. The same day, Proxmire delivered a speech on the Senate floor that condemned the failure of the Housing and Urban Development Department to act on recommendation from staff members to terminate funding for the P.I. Properties&#x27; 285-unit project at 14th and Clifton Streets in Washington, DC.

Proxmire was the only senator to vote against Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Secretary of the Interior nominee of Donald P. Hodel in 1985.

===Golden Fleece Award===

Proxmire was noted for issuing his Golden Fleece Award, which was presented monthly between 1975 and 1988 to focus media attention on projects that he viewed as self-serving and wasteful of taxpayer dollars. Winners of the Golden Fleece Award included governmental organizations like the United States Department of Defense, Bureau of Land Management, and National Park Service.

The first Golden Fleece Award was awarded in 1975 to the National Science Foundation for funding an $84,000 study on why people fall in love. Other Golden Fleece awards over the years were awarded to the Justice Department for conducting a study on why prisoners wanted to get out of jail, the National Institute of Mental Health to study a Peruvian brothel (&quot;The researchers said they made repeated visits in the interests of accuracy,&quot; reported &quot;The New York Times&quot;), and the Federal Aviation Administration for studying &quot;the physical measurements of 432 airline stewardesses, paying special attention to the &#x27;length of the buttocks.&#x27;&quot;

Proxmire&#x27;s critics said that some of his Golden Fleece awards went to basic science projects that led to important breakthroughs. In some circles, his name has become a verb for unfairly obstructing scientific research for political gain, as in &quot;the project has been proxmired.&quot; In 1987, Stewart Brand accused Proxmire of recklessly attacking legitimate research for the crass purpose of furthering his own political career, with gross indifference as to whether his assertions were true or false as well as the long-term effects on American science and technology policy. Proxmire later apologized for several canceled projects, including SETI.

It is widely but incorrectly believed that Proxmire gave the award to Edward F. Knipling for his study of the sex life of the screwworm fly, the results of which were used to create sterile screwworms that were released into the wild and eliminated this major cattle parasite from North and Central America, which reduced the cost of beef and dairy products across the globe. In fact, there is no evidence for this claim in the Proxmire papers held by the Wisconsin Historical Society. In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture funded research on the sex life of the screwworm fly took place in the 1930s to the 1950s, long before the Golden Fleece era of the 1970s and 1980s, when Proxmire largely targeted contemporary research.

One winner of the Golden Fleece Award, Ronald Hutchinson, sued Proxmire for defamation in 1976. Proxmire claimed that his statements about Hutchinson&#x27;s research were protected by the Speech or Debate Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that that clause does not immunize members of Congress from liability for defamatory statements made outside of formal congressional proceedings (&quot;Hutchinson v. Proxmire&quot;, ). The case was eventually settled out of court.

==Personal life==
In 1946, Proxmire married Elsie Stillman Rockefeller, a great-granddaughter of William Rockefeller, brother and partner of oil magnate John D. Rockefeller. They had two children, a son, Theodore, and a daughter, Elsie Stillman (Proxmire) Zwerner. Elsie Proxmire received an uncontested divorce in 1955.

In 1956, Proxmire married Ellen Imogene Hodges Sawall, who brought two children of her own to the marriage. Together, the couple had two sons, one of whom died in infancy.

Proxmire was the first United States Senator to get hair transplants for his pattern hair loss. The treatment he was receiving for a couple of months began on February 22, 1972. His 1972 tax return which was published in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; revealed that he paid $2,758 for his hair transplant and claimed the operation as a medical expense.

Known for his devotion to personal fitness, which included jogging and push-ups, Proxmire earned the moniker &quot;Push Up&quot;. In 1973, he published a book about staying in shape, entitled &quot;You Can Do It: Senator Proxmire&#x27;s Exercise, Diet and Relaxation Plan&quot;. After leaving Congress, Proxmire had an office in the Library of Congress.

In 1998, Proxmire announced that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died on December 15, 2005, aged 90, at a nursing home in Sykesville, Maryland, where he had lived for more than four years. He was buried at Lake Forest Cemetery in Lake Forest, Illinois.

<text>Wellington City Council is a territorial authority in New Zealand, governing the city of Wellington, the country&#x27;s capital city and third-largest city by population, behind Auckland and Christchurch. It consists of the central historic town and certain additional areas within the Wellington metropolitan area, extending as far north as Linden and covering rural areas such as Mākara and Ohariu. The city adjoins Porirua in the north and Hutt City in the north-east. It is one of nine territorial authorities in the Wellington Region.

Wellington attained city status in 1886. The settlement had become the colonial capital and seat of government by 1865, replacing Auckland. Parliament officially sat in Wellington for the first time on 26 July 1865. During the last half of the nineteenth century, Wellington grew rapidly from 7,460 residents in 1867 to 49,344 by the end of the century.

The council represents a population of as of and consists of a mayor and fifteen councillors elected from six wards (Northern, Onslow-Western, Lambton, Eastern, Southern general wards and Te Whanganui-a-Tara Māori ward). It administers public works, sanitation, land use and building consents, among other local services. The council has used the marketing slogan &quot;Absolutely Positively Wellington&quot; in an official capacity since the early 1990s.

On 22 October 2024 the New Zealand government appointed Lindsay McKenzie as a Crown Observer to the council after the Council was forced to revise its 2023–2024 Long Term Plan in response to a failed attempt to sell its airport shares. MP and former Wellington City councillor Tamatha Paul has accused the government&#x27;s decision to appoint the Crown Observer as politically motivated.

==Council and committees==

The mayor and all councillors are members of council. Following a review in 2021 by former Local Government New Zealand chief executive Peter Winder, the council adopted a new committee structure. All committees apart from Te Kaunihera o Pōneke Council and Unaunahi Ngaio Chief Executive Performance Review Committee include two mana whenua representatives (&quot;pouiwi&quot;), who are paid and have voting rights.

Wellington&#x27;s local electoral wards were given Māori names in 2018, after consultation with mana whenua.

===Mayor===

One mayor is elected at large from the entire Wellington City district.

===Te Whanganui-a-Tara Māori ward ===
Te Whanganui a Tara is a Māori ward created by Wellington City Council in 2021. The 2022 election returned Nīkau Wi-Neera as its first-ever councillor.

===Motukairangi/Eastern Ward===
Motukairangi/Eastern Ward returns three councillors to the Wellington City Council. Since 2022 the councillors are:

=== Pouiwi ===
Two &quot;pouiwi&quot; (tribal representatives) were appointed in 2023 by the Council&#x27;s Tākai Here partners, Taranaki Whānui ki te Upoko o te Ika and Ngāti Toa Rangatira. They have voting rights on Council committees, including committees of the whole, but not on the full Council. Since 2023 the &quot;pouiwi&quot; are:
===Community boards===
The council has created two local community boards under the provisions of Part 4 of the Local Government Act 2002, with members elected using a single transferable vote (STV) system or appointed by the council.

These are:
*Tawa Community Board, having six elected members and two appointed members, representing the northern suburbs of Tawa, Grenada North and Takapū Valley; and
*Mākara/Ōhāriu Community Board, having six elected members, representing the rural suburbs of Ohariu, Mākara and Mākara Beach.

The Wellington City Council owns and until May 2019 operated from a complex on Wakefield Street, with various extensions each representing a distinctive architectural period. The complex incorporates the Wellington Town Hall which opened in 1904, with the most recent extension completed in 1991 alongside the Wellington Central Library.

The Wakefield Street complex has been cleared of back office functions, and since 28 May 2019 will be closed completely for repairs and earthquake strengthening. In the interim, most of the council&#x27;s central office staff are located in commercial premises at 113 The Terrace, and the council&#x27;s public service centre is at 12 Manners Street. Due to repairs also being needed to the Wellington Central Library, and Capital E, all of the civic buildings on Civic Square are closed, except for the City Gallery.

<text>Wellington Province, governed by the Wellington Provincial Council, was one of the provinces of New Zealand from 1853 until the abolition of provincial government in 1876. It covered much of the southern half of the North Island until November 1858, when Hawke&#x27;s Bay Province split off, taking about a third of its area.

==Territory==
Wellington Province originally covered much of the southern half of the North Island. Its northern boundary was drawn arbitrarily across most of the middle of the island at latitude 39° south to the east coast, just including the entirety of Hawke Bay. North of that line was Auckland Province. The straight-line boundary did not extend right to the west coast, but dipped south to the coast just west of Waverley and short of Patea, allowing for New Plymouth Province (later renamed Taranaki Province) to the west.


Hawke&#x27;s Bay settlers broke away to form Hawke&#x27;s Bay Province on 1 November 1858. Wellington Province&#x27;s new eastern boundary followed the main divide of the eastern ranges, and cut across from just south of Woodville to the east coast near Cape Turnagain. Thus Wellington lost about a third of its area, leaving it with a territory roughly the same as the combined present-day Manawatū-Whanganui and Wellington regions.

The latter Wellington provincial boundaries include four of New Zealand&#x27;s main urban areas: Wellington, Palmerston North, Whanganui and Kāpiti. Other large towns are Feilding, Levin and Masterton. According to Statistics New Zealand figures at the 2001 census 626,000 people lived within the provincial boundaries.

==European settlement==
European settlement in what became Wellington Province started at Port Nicholson (now called Wellington Harbour) and at Whanganui in 1840. Settlement in Hawke&#x27;s Bay started a decade later, around 1850.

==Superintendents==

Wellington Province had two successive superintendents.

==Legislation==
The only two acts of the provincial assembly still in effect are the Manawatu Racecourse Act 1869 and the Wanganui And Rangitikei Racecourses Act 1862.

==Anniversary Day==
New Zealand law provides an anniversary day for each province. Wellington Anniversary Day is the Monday that falls closest to 22 January and is observed as a public holiday within the old provincial boundaries.

<text>Canadian Forces Base North Bay, also CFB North Bay, is an air force base located at the City of North Bay, Ontario about north of Toronto. The base is subordinate to 1 Canadian Air Division, Winnipeg, Manitoba, and is the centre for North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) operations in Canada, under the Canadian NORAD Region Headquarters, also in Winnipeg. It is also home to the 1 Air Force, Detachment 2 of the United States Air Force.

22 Wing/Canadian Forces Base North Bay is the most important military base in Canada with respect to the continental air defence of North America and the country&#x27;s air sovereignty. It is also home to one of the most unusual military installations in North America, the NORAD Underground Complex, an installation built over 60 storeys underground inside a cave almost 1.5x longer than an American football field and nearly 5 storeys tall.

On 1 April 1993, all air bases in Canada were redesignated as wings; the base was renamed 22 Wing/Canadian Forces Base North Bay. This is abbreviated as 22 Wing/CFB North Bay. Today, although this designation still stands, the base is often referred to simply as &quot;22 Wing&quot;, and the Base Commander as the &quot;Wing Commander&quot;.

North Bay&#x27;s air force base is the centre for the air defence of the entire country, and works in concert with the United States via NORAD for the air defence of Canada-U.S. portion of the North American continent. Activities are wide-ranging, from identifying and monitoring all aircraft entering Canada from overseas, to guarding foreign dignitaries travelling in the country&#x27;s airspace, to assisting aircraft suffering airborne emergencies, to aiding law enforcement versus smugglers, to participating in NORAD&#x27;s Christmas Eve Tracking of Santa Claus for children. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s it took in Unidentified Flying Object reports from across the country on behalf of the National Research Council of Canada, relaying the reports to a study at the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, British Columbia. In 2000, it resumed UFO reporting, provided to researcher Chris Rutkowski at the University of Manitoba.

In 2010, North Bay&#x27;s operations centre took the first steps towards transitioning from air to aerospace defence, commencing preparations for Sapphire, Canada&#x27;s first military satellite. Sapphire functions as a contributing sensor in the United States Space Surveillance Network (SSN), performing surveillance of objects orbiting at 6,000 to 40,000 kilometres altitude, and delivering data on those objects (called Resident Space Objects, or RSOs) to the Space Surveillance Operations Centre (SSOC), in North Bay&#x27;s operations centre. The SSOC, in turn, coordinates with the Joint Space Operations Center, in Vandenberg, California. On 25 February 2013, Sapphire was launched from a site in India, and underwent technical testing and checks, expected to begin its duties in July 2013. Due to various technical delays, the satellite&#x27;s FOC (Final Operational Certification) wasn&#x27;t achieved until 30 January 2014. By end of that year it had delivered 1.2 million observations of space objects.

22 Wing/CFB North Bay has two unique properties among air bases in Canada. It is the only Canadian air base that does not have flying units (as of August 1992, when the last flying squadron departed), and the only air base in the country that does not have an airfield (base assets such as control tower, fuel depot and hangars were demolished or sold following the 1992 departure).

==Activities at North Bay 1920–1945==

===Pre–Second World War===
North Bay&#x27;s first contact with the air force took place on 9 October 1920, when a Government of Canada Felixstowe F.3 flying boat overflew the (then) town during the first crossing of Canada by aircraft. (North Bay was not incorporated as a city until 1925.) The F.3&#x27;s pilots were Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Leckie, of Toronto, and Major Basil Deacon Hobbs, of Sault Ste. Marie. The trans-Canada expedition was an epic venture, lasting 11 days and requiring six aircraft. The third leg was flown non-stop from the Canadian capital, Ottawa, to Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, with North Bay as a checkpoint. 

Leckie&#x27;s and Hobbs&#x27;s encounter with North Bay was fleeting. They arrived without warning, approaching out of the east, catching residents unaware. Few had seen an aircraft before; the effect was electrifying, akin to the Space Shuttle appearing suddenly over the city today. Leckie steered for the downtown. Over the Canadian Pacific Railway station he dropped a signal to be telegraphed to the Air Board in Ottawa, &quot;Making a good 50 miles per hour&quot;, then with a wave to lunchtime onlookers, the pilots swung their F.3 out over nearby Lake Nipissing, onwards to Sault Ste.

The overflight planted interest in local politicians, businessmen and community leaders towards aviation, particularly the establishment of an air station at North Bay. In the summer of 1921, a Government of Canada Curtiss HS-2L flying boat, taking on exploration and aerial survey work, landed at North Bay, on Lake Nipissing. The HS-2L landed on Lake Nipissing and Trout Lake (on the eastern periphery of North Bay) in 1922, for further aerial surveying as well as cargo and passenger transport. These flights amplified this interest and a campaign to the federal government for an aerodrome commenced.

On 1 January 1923, the Department of National Defence (DND) took over responsibility and control over military and (until 2 November 1936) civil aviation in Canada. Over the next decade-and-half Canadian Air Force (as of 1 April 1924, &quot;Royal Canadian Air Force&quot;) Squadron Leader John Henry Tudhope, a South African-born First World War fighter pilot, almost single-handedly laid down the network of aviation in Canada, exploring and surveying the country for the construction of aerodromes and establishment of air routes for the Trans-Canada Air Lines system, essentially a national air highway network. Considering that Canada was nearly the size of Europe and mostly raw, primal wilderness, Tudhope&#x27;s undertaking was staggering. In 1930, S/L Tudhope received the McKee Trophy for his endeavours, the premier aviation award in Canada.

In 1928, Tudhope stopped twice at North Bay, and again in 1931 and 1932. Based on his exploration and survey work in the Northern Ontario region, in June 1933 DND set up a headquarters in North Bay to supervise construction of emergency landing fields for the Ottawa to Port Arthur (now Thunder Bay) portion of the Trans-Canada Airway system. An 18-man unit operated out of the Dominion Rubber Company building, leased on Oak Street, downtown North Bay, which served as their headquarters, supply depot and living quarters. Unemployed men in each local district were hired as labour. Despite the primal ruggedness of Northern Ontario, by July 1936, eight airfields had been hacked out of the wilderness, at Reay, Diver, Emsdale, South River, Ramore, Porquis Junction, Gilles Depot and Tudhope (named after the squadron leader), and the unit was disbanded. Most of these airfields have since been abandoned to the wild. Ironically, although the nucleus of the operation, and recommended by S/L Tudhope in June 1936, North Bay was not considered as a site for an aerodrome.

The first air force aircraft to land at North Bay arrived 17 to 23 May 1930. Eight Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) flying boats stopped temporarily at Trout Lake during flights west. Two were en route to Winnipeg; two to Lake Athabasca, Saskatchewan; four to Northern Saskatchewan. This plus the landing field construction described above prompted local politicians, businessmen and community leaders to intensify their years-long campaign to the Canadian government for an airport. At issue was money; who would finance the project. On 21 March 1938, their perseverance paid off. The Canadian government approved expenditure of funds to build an airport at North Bay. The Province of Ontario and City of North Bay would provide the land. It would be a Trans-Canada Air Lines (TCA) facility; TCA was the country&#x27;s government-operated air line (and forerunner of Air Canada).

On 27 April 1938, work began. The first unofficial landing by two area residents in a de Havilland DH.60 Moth took place on 4 July 1938, in the midst of construction. The first official landing occurred 30 September 1938, by Squadron Leader Robert Dodds, RCAF, to inspect the work. A Royal Flying Corps fighter pilot during the First World War, and close associate of Squadron Leader Tudhope during the latter&#x27;s exploration and survey of Canada, Dodds had been seconded by DND to the Department of Transport as Inspector of Airways and Aerodromes for the country. On 28 November 1938, the long sought after airport was ready to receive aircraft; due to bad weather regular passenger service at the facility did not begin until May 1939.

===Second World War===
Despite a common, popular misconception that Royal Canadian Air Force Station North Bay was formed during the Second World War, the air base didn&#x27;t exist until 1951.

In October 1939, the Canadian government announced that North Bay&#x27;s fledgling airport, open less than 12 months, was in contention as a British Empire Air Training Plan site. The BEATP (eventually renamed the &quot;British Commonwealth Air Training Plan&quot;, or &quot;BCATP&quot;) was the biggest international military aircrew training operation in history. There were more aircrew training schools in Britain, but the BCATP taught and evaluated 131,553 pilot, navigator, observer, wireless (radio) operator, air gunner, wireless air gunner and flight engineer recruits from around the world, plus 5,296 graduates from Royal Air Force (RAF) schools.

North Bay&#x27;s location presented an allure for air training. It was far from major built-up areas and its skies uncluttered by air traffic, altogether a reasonably safe arena for young aircrew hopefuls attempting to learn the tricky art of military flying. In 1940 a small glass &quot;greenhouse&quot; was constructed atop the airport&#x27;s administration building in anticipation of air traffic control, necessary to handle the sudden proliferation of aircraft. But the government decided not to include North Bay in the training scheme.

The airport&#x27;s sole service to the air force over the next two years was essentially like a roadside truckstop, providing fuel, rest and meals to aircrew flying across the country. By 1942 so many aircraft were stopping at North Bay that No. 124 Squadron, RCAF, set up a seven-man detachment at the airport. Under the command of a Flying Officer (today&#x27;s rank, Lieutenant), two aeroengine mechanics, an electrician and an airframe mechanic re-fuelled, serviced and repaired the aircraft. A driver and vehicle mechanic saw to the detachment&#x27;s staff car, aircraft towing tractor and fuel truck. The staff car was eventually replaced by a more practical &quot;Truck, Panel, Delivery&quot;.

The biggest impact on the airport during the war was delivered by the Royal Air Force (RAF). In November 1940 a grand, dangerous experiment had been conducted. Masses of new, desperately needed aircraft shipped from Canada and Newfoundland for the war effort in Britain were being lost in the Atlantic Ocean, their cargo vessels sunk by German U-boats. To reduce these losses an idea was proposed to ferry aircraft instead—fly them over the ocean. It was a breath-taking proposal. In 1940 transoceanic flying was raw and new. Aircrew had no navigation aids to steer by except the sun, moon and stars. Search and rescue beyond the coasts of North America, Ireland and Britain was nonexistent. Mechanical and electrical breakdowns in aircraft were common. In an emergency there was nowhere to land except the North Atlantic.

Nevertheless, on the evening of 10 November 1940, the experiment began; seven twin-engine Lockheed Hudson light bombers lifted off from Gander, Newfoundland en route for Britain. The odds were deemed so poor that only four of the bombers were expected to succeed. Yet the following morning, engines sucking their last gallons of fuel, all seven bombers arrived safely in Northern Ireland.

Inspired, the Royal Air Force commenced large-scale ferrying of aircraft. A training school for ferry aircrews was set up at Dorval, Quebec, outside Montreal, but by 1942 Dorval&#x27;s airspace had become crowded with military aircraft. A new training site was set up at North Bay, taking advantage of the uncluttered skies and freedom from major built-up areas that had made the airport an ideal BEATP/BCATP candidate.

On 1 June 1942, ground around the airport was cleared and tents set up for RAF Ferry Command&#x27;s Trans-Atlantic Training Unit. Five Hudson bombers arrived shortly afterwards. Over the next three years, the unit—renamed No. 313 Ferry Training Unit in 1943—taught hundreds of aircrew, in three to four-week courses, the techniques and procedures of transatlantic flying, and how to solve in-flight problems and emergencies. The size of the unit isn&#x27;t known. However, although a formal air base hadn&#x27;t been established, the RAF expanded the airport dramatically. A new double hangar was built (still in use today), as well as a Works and Stores Building (i.e., Supply), guard house, salvage store, recreation building, hospital, fire station and fire protective system, coal compound and general purpose building.

The Canadian Department of Transport added water and power supply systems, plus provided clearing and grading for the hangars, aprons and roads.

In 1943, three air traffic controllers were posted to the airport—the first ATC at North Bay—to coordinate airfield flying operations from the glass &quot;greenhouse&quot; built atop the admin building in 1940.

Nine more Hudsons joined the original five, along with two North American B-25 Mitchell bombers and a de Havilland Tiger Moth biplane. Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, de Havilland Mosquitos and Douglas Dakota transports were taken on in 1944.

The RAF personnel melded seamlessly into North Bay. They loved the fresh wildness of the region, an exotic experience for many of the British. Area citizens welcomed them as part of the community. The Unit responded in kind, such as aiding blood donor drives, entering a team in the local softball league, and participated in shooting where they won and golf competitions, earning a consolation prize.

In September 1945, with the war over, the RCAF detachment disbanded. No. 313 Ferry Training Unit followed suit in October. Their facilities were donated to the Canadian government. Mass flying finished, the air traffic controllers were posted out and North Bay&#x27;s airport returned to its sleepy, low-key pre-war state, and so it would remain until birth of the air base in 1951.

Despite the thousands of military flights transiting through North Bay and training for trans-oceanic flying, there were only 11 crashes, with only one being fatal. On 28 April 1945, a No. 313 Ferry Training Unit B-25 Mitchell crashed, killing pilots Flying Officer Leslie William Laurence Davies of England and Flight Sergeant William Gribbin of Scotland. Both men are buried in North Bay cemeteries. This was also the first fatal crash of an aircraft, civilian or military, at North Bay&#x27;s airport and in the North Bay area.

==RCAF Station North Bay==
Royal Canadian Air Force Station North Bay was founded on 1 September 1951, part of the expansion of Canada&#x27;s air defences in face of the rising threat of nuclear air attack from the Soviet Union. Canada, by virtue of its geography, was presented with an unpleasant situation. No sooner had the Second World War ended than friction between the Soviet Union and Western countries began, rapidly heated up, and spread around the globe, raising the spectre of a Third World War. Called the &quot;Cold War&quot;, both sides had weapons pointed at each other—by 1949 nuclear weapons. The main adversaries were the Soviet Union and the United States. Canada lay between the two, meaning Soviet bombers would cross Canadian territory to strike at the United States, while U.S. fighters would swarm Canada to shoot them down. Whether the country liked it or not, in a war it would become a major nuclear battleground. For this reason, plus its long-standing friendship with the United States, Canada embarked on a nationwide development of its air defences, dovetailed with America&#x27;s expansion of its own defences (which included building and manning numerous air defence radar sites on Canadian soil). North Bay&#x27;s air force base was a piece of this development.

A massive building campaign began in 1951 around North Bay&#x27;s tiny airport, including construction of an additional, larger double hangar; a proper control tower; air traffic control radio and radar systems; and fuel, oil, lubricant and weapons facilities for military aircraft; plus improvements to the runways, taxiways and aprons. In fact, North Bay was outfitted with a 10,000-foot runway, one of the longest in Canada, for reasons other than air defence: during war, the base was also a designated recovery site for American bombers returning damaged and/or short of fuel from nuclear strikes on the Soviet Union. A side effect of having this runway, decades later North Bay was selected as an emergency site for NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle, and periodically, due to the long runway and relatively isolated location, free of air traffic and built-up areas, plus security offered by the military, NASA used North Bay&#x27;s airfield for research into different fields of aviation.

Across Airport Road, the main route to the airfield from the City of North Bay, the rugged Northern Ontario terrain was cleared and the support infrastructure for the station built—headquarters, barracks, dining hall, messes, hospital, gym, motor pool, supply, firehall, RCAF police guardhouse, Protestant and Roman Catholic chapels, married quarters for air force families, and much more. The majority of facilities donated to the airfield by the British when the Royal Air Force departed at the end of the Second World War were demolished and replaced.

The base had the biggest impact on the community since the linking of railways with North Bay in the early 20th century. Construction, services and contracts for the base infused millions of dollars into the community, and by the end of November 1953 the RCAF station was the leading employer in the area: 1,018 military personnel plus over 160 civilians. This status would continue for four decades, until the departure of the last flying squadron from North Bay in 1992 and subsequent downsizing of the air base. At its peak, the air base had a strength of about 2,200 military and civilian personnel. (Base strength, as of June 2011, was 540 Regular Force, 77 Reserve Force, 34 United States Air Force and over 100 civilian personnel.)

===No. 3 All-Weather (Fighter) Operational Training Unit===
The air base&#x27;s &quot;raison d&#x27;etre&quot; was (and still is) air defence. On 1 October 1951, one month after RCAF Station North Bay&#x27;s official birth, No. 3 All-Weather (Fighter) Operational Training Unit was formed at the base. No. 3 AW(F)OTU was a state-of-the-art school teaching military flying, interception and fighter combat in all weather conditions, day or night—cutting-edge techniques in 1951. Students came from as far away as New Zealand. The instructors were among the world&#x27;s elite in air defence. The unit&#x27;s second Officer Commanding (OC) was Wing Commander Edward Crew, Royal Air Force. Crew was replaced in 1954 by another Englishman, Wing Commander Robert Braham. Crew and Braham also commanded RCAF Station North Bay for brief periods. No. 3 AW(F)OTU transferred to RCAF Station Cold Lake in mid-1955.

Among No. 3 AW(F)OTU&#x27;s instructors were the first Americans to serve at North Bay&#x27;s air base: USAF Major John Eiser and Captain B. Delosier, arriving 9 January 1952. Americans have continued to serve at North Bay in one military capacity or another into the 21st Century.

===Fighter squadrons===
The sole purpose of the air force base at North Bay is air defence, to monitor and protect the skies. At first this was limited to around North Bay, then expanded to the Northern Ontario area of Canada, then east, central and Arctic Canada, and finally all of Canada, the latter an area the size of Europe. Between the base&#x27;s birth in 1951 to 1964, as well as the operational training unit, it was home to a succession of combat units devoted to this purpose.

Five fighter interceptor squadrons served at North Bay. In succession, 430 Squadron (5 November 1951 to 27 September 1952), 445 Squadron (1 April to 31 August 1953), 419 Squadron (15 March 1954 to 1 August 1957), 433 Squadron (15 October 1955 to 1 August 1961) and 414 Squadron (1 August 1957 to 30 June 1964).

430 Squadron flew Canadair Sabre Mark II fighters, plus T-33 Silver Star jet trainers and propeller-driven North American Harvards for training. While at North Bay, the squadron was commanded by James &quot;Stocky&quot; Edwards, a highly decorated and an extraordinarily skilled fighter pilot with an impressive wartime career. 

North Bay&#x27;s next fighter unit, 445 Squadron, was the first in the world armed with the Avro CF-100 Canuck interceptor. The CF-100 was one of two combat aircraft designed and built entirely in Canada, and the only one to enter air force service. It had the ability to hunt other aircraft in any weather, night or day, making the CF-100 the preeminent interceptor among global air forces when it began service with the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1952. Nos. 419, 433 and 414 Squadrons also flew CF-100 interceptors. CF-100s also flew with the RCAF in Europe on NATO deployments.

North Bay&#x27;s last fighter unit, 414 Squadron, was re-armed with the CF-101 Voodoo in 1962, flying the jet fighters in air defence until the squadron was disbanded in 1964. 

In addition to its fighter squadrons, from September 1956 – September 1960, North Bay operated a CF-100 Staging Detachment at Lakehead Airport in Fort William, Ontario. A pair of CF-100 interceptors from the base were deployed, or &quot;staged&quot;, at the Lakehead to defend the Northwest Ontario and Manitoba regions of the country.

In 1960 the staging detachment was changed from a fighter to a TACAN (Tactical Air Navigation) unit. RCAF Station North Bay also operated a second TACAN unit at Kapuskasing, in Northern Ontario. &quot;TACAN&quot; is a radio navigation beacon that helps military aircrew determine their location and direction of flight. In the 1950s and 1960s it was an indispensable aid when traversing the vast Canadian wilderness landscape. Flight computers in aircraft then were Stone Age compared to today, and navigation-assistance systems such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) did not exist. To get lost over Canada presented airmen with the prospect of running out of fuel and having to eject or crash-land in some of the wildest territory in North America. Wrecks and bodies were sometimes not found for weeks, months or years; some have never been found. To give an idea of the roughness of the Canadian wilderness: even though authorities knew the general location, it took four years to find a rocket pod full of live rockets that had jettisoned from a jet fighter in 1958 when a switch malfunctioned.

Both of North Bay&#x27;s TACAN units were disbanded in the 1960s, but TACAN sites are still found throughout the country today, some providing assistance to civilian as well as military aviators.

A concern for northern and bush operations in Canada was in identifying the Magnetic North Pole, benchmark for all land, sea and air compasses in the northern hemisphere. The exact position of the Magnetic North Pole was not pinpointed until flyers from 22 Wing in 1948 plotted the exact position. At that point, 22 Wing was a photographic flying unit stationed at CFB Rockcliffe, Ontario, mapping and charting the country, separate from and unrelated to the air base at North Bay.

===131 Composite Unit and the temporary end of military flying at North Bay===
414 Squadron, North Bay&#x27;s last fighter squadron, was disbanded in June 1964, partly due to government cuts to the RCAF, and partly due to a change in the strategy for the air defence of North America, that Soviet nuclear-weapon armed bombers should be stopped as far from the North American landmass as possible. Better to fight the war (especially one of nuclear weapons) over the ocean rather than over home territory; North Bay was deemed too far from the coast for its fighters to be useful in this strategy.

414 Squadron&#x27;s departure left 131 Composite Unit as the sole flying unit at the base. Formed on 1 July 1962, 131 Composite Unit was a &quot;catch-all&quot; organization that flew two-seat T-33 Silver Star jet trainers and propeller-engine Beech C-45 Expeditor and Douglas C-47/CC-129 Dakota transports. As well as hauling cargo and personnel, the unit provided targets for training of RCAF interceptor aircrews, and were used by pilots and navigators on the Northern NORAD Region headquarters staff, at the base, to maintain their flying skills.

131 Composite Unit was disbanded in November 1967. For the next five years, except for occasional visits by aircraft from other air force bases, all military flying at North Bay ceased. One of the hangars, once packed with jet interceptors, was converted into an ice arena for the City of North Bay. The only air defence activity at the base in this five-year period was in NORAD&#x27;s famous Underground Complex (described below).

==Air Defence Ground Units and installations at North Bay==
Air defence ground units are those air defence organizations not equipped with aircraft. The majority are devoted to searching for, identifying, and keeping track of aircraft in the sky, and coordinating with fighters to intercept aircraft that either cannot be identified; are suspicious; require assistance; participating in criminal activity; intruding in sovereign airspace; or have been declared hostile.

Surface-to-air missile (SAM) squadrons like the BOMARCs in Canada during the 1960s and early 1970s are also considered air defence ground units. SAMs of course are used only in war, or if an isolated attack (such as the 9/11 attacks) is made during peacetime.

In war, the air defence ground units monitoring the skies may use surface-to-air missiles as well as fighters to intercept and shoot down hostile aircraft and any air-to-surface missiles (ASMs) launched by those aircraft (especially since ASMs launched against countries or a continent are usually nuclear-tipped, aimed to destroy cities, military bases and industrial installations).

Today, CFB North Bay is responsible for the air defence of all of Canada&#x27;s skies, and, in concert with the United States, the skies over the Canadian-U.S. portion of the North American continent, an airspace about twice the size of Europe. The seeds of this important work were sown over 60 years ago in a tiny radar unit, crammed into a small clutch of trucks.

===6 Aircraft Control &amp; Warning Unit===
North Bay&#x27;s first air defence ground unit was 6 Aircraft Control &amp; Warning Unit (abbreviated as &quot;6 AC&amp;WU&quot;). Created on 4 February 1952, just four months after the base was born, the unit was equipped with Second World War-vintage British Air Ministry Experimental System (AMES) 11C radar equipment. Intended to be mobile, to move and operate wherever the air force needed it, 6 AC&amp;WU worked inside a handful of van-size trucks. It stood sentinel over the skies in a circle of about centered on the base at North Bay; its assignments were to detect all aircraft entering this area; evaluate who they were and if they posed a threat; provide early warning to RCAF Station North Bay of hostile, suspicious and unidentified aircraft; and guide the air station&#x27;s jet fighters by radio to intercept these aircraft.

6 AC&amp;WU&#x27;s strength comprised three officers and 32 Other Ranks. The latter including 19 airwomen, the first time in Royal Canadian Air Force history women were allowed to work in air defence.

In March 1952 it was decided that 6 AC&amp;WU would not be using its mobility, and the ground air defence unit was transferred out of its trucks into a building on the base.

&quot;Ground Controlled Interception&quot;, or &quot;GCI&quot;, was a major function of the base, providing air force personnel in a ground station, like a radar site or an air defence command and control centre with the systems to guide fighters to intercept an aircraft. The ground control is done by radio. The usual method is the ground controller and the interceptor&#x27;s aircrew talk to each other. In the past, on occasion – such as with the CF-101 Voodoo interceptor – the information could sometimes be transmitted to the fighter by datalink. Datalink sends information to the fighter&#x27;s crew by the press of a button at a console in the ground station rather than a controller speaking to the aircrew, loosely similar to how WiFi sends data to computers today. Datalink has the advantage that, since no words are spoken, an enemy can&#x27;t eavesdrop into the radio frequency and listen to what the ground controller and aircrew are doing and planning. Despite this advantage, the majority of GCI practiced by air forces around the world was (and still is) done by the ground controller and the aircrew talking over the radio.

On 15 April 1952, 6 AC&amp;WU carried out the first GCI at North Bay, a training session to evaluate the unit&#x27;s people and radar equipment. The unit&#x27;s ground controllers guided a No. 3 All-Weather (Fighter) Operational Training Unit jet interceptor against one of the operational training unit&#x27;s twin-engine C-45 Expeditor transports. From the success of this and subsequent training, on 15 May 1952, 6 Aircraft Control &amp; Warning Unit began around-the-clock air defence operations, working with 430 Squadron Sabre jet fighters for the defence of the North Bay area. It was the first small step in North Bay&#x27;s gradual expansion to overseeing the air defence of the entire country.

6 AC&amp;WU continued as part of the base until 1 December 1952, when it was reassigned to a new, large radar station being built at Falconbridge, Ontario, about west of North Bay. Renamed &quot;33 Aircraft Control &amp; Warning Squadron Detachment&quot;, the unit remained at North Bay for seven more months, defending the area, until the end of May 1953, when Falconbridge was finally ready to assume control of air defence in its region of Canada. (Falconbridge watched a circle of sky about 400 miles in diameter, about 640 kilometres, a dramatic improvement over 6 AC&amp;WU.)

===Ground Observer Corps===
Between June 1953 and May 1960, two RCAF Ground Observer Corps groups operated in North Bay: 5 Ground Observer Corps Unit and 50 Ground Observer Corps Detachment. 5 Ground Observer Corps Unit was set up in a leased commercial building in the heart of the City of North Bay. Commanded by an RCAF squadron leader, and manned by RCAF personnel as well as seven paid civilian employees, it oversaw Ground Observer Corps Detachments and Observation Posts in Ontario at North Bay, Brockville, London and Peterborough, and at Winnipeg, Manitoba.

While 6 AC&amp;WU had defended airspace in the vicinity of a single city, 5 Ground Observer Corps Unit was watching the skies over all of Ontario, part of Manitoba and a slice of western Quebec, an area larger than France, Belgium and the Netherlands combined. The scope of the Unit&#x27;s operations is illustrated by one 1958 air defence exercise that involved 14,000 civilian volunteers and military personnel and over 60 aircraft.

50 Ground Observer Corps Detachment and its filter centre belonged to 5 Ground Observer Corps Unit. Opened on 30 June 1953 by Air Vice Marshal Arthur James, Commander of the RCAF&#x27;s Air Defence Command, the Detachment and its centre were installed in a converted ex-movie theatre in the Sibbett Building, a well-known downtown North Bay City landmark, and were responsible for surveillance of the skies and providing early warning of hostile aircraft in north-central Ontario, an area roughly the size of England, Scotland and Wales. Along with an RCAF Commanding Officer, a small RCAF staff, and 1 or 2 paid civilians, a large contingent of unpaid civilian volunteers were employed at the Detachment and its centre, hired through newspaper advertisements and recruiting drives at such places as movie theatres and department stores. Despite the heavy reliance on civilian volunteers, the Detachment and centre were round-the-clock operations, and trained exhaustively how to respond to a Soviet air attack, such as in the military exercise mentioned above.

The problem with the Ground Observer Corps and its filter centres is that they largely mirrored the air defences of the Battle of Britain, 1940. They relied heavily on &quot;eyeball&quot; reports of aircraft, a particular conundrum if an air attack was made at night, in bad weather, or dense cloud cover when visibility was severely hampered or nonexistent. In the filter centres, aircraft movements were marked by plots hand-pushed atop giant map tables. In an age of jet aircraft and nuclear weapons this process was achingly slow and woefully unreliable. In May 1960 the Corps and its filter centres south of the 55th Parallel (including those in North Bay) were disbanded, rendered obsolete by NORAD&#x27;s new computerized SAGE system and the (then) state-of-the-art Distant Early Warning, Mid-Canada Line and Pinetree Line radar networks. The Ground Observer Corps north of the 55th Parallel was retained for four more years, due to the value to NORAD and RCAF Air Defence Command of observations phoned or radioed in of aircraft spotted crossing the north. In January 1964 the northern operations were ended, and the Ground Observer Corps finally disbanded.

==NORAD and the Underground Complex==
During the Cold War, Canada found itself in an unenviable geographic position, lying directly between the Cold War&#x27;s principal adversaries, the Soviet Union and United States. This meant if the war turned &quot;hot&quot;, Canada would become a major nuclear battleground: to reach their American targets—cities, military bases and industrial installations—Soviet nuclear weapon–armed bombers would have to cross Canadian airspace, while U.S. interceptors would swarm Canadian airspace to shoot the attackers down (and vice versa).

Thus by default Canada was the air defence &quot;front trenches&quot; for the North American continent. For this reason, plus its friendship with the United States, on 12 September 1957, Canada and the U.S. formed NORAD, the North American Air Defence Command, an organization that unified the two countries&#x27; air defences into a single, coordinated, fast-reacting, continent-wide network. It was (and still is) a true partnership; the Commander-in-Chief of NORAD is always an American, the deputy commander always a Canadian. Both are able to access the highest levels of the U.S. and Canadian militaries and national governments. Canadian and American NORAD personnel work at each other&#x27;s bases and installations, performing the same defence duties.

The NORAD Agreement was officially signed by both nations on 12 May 1958. The name was altered to North American Aerospace Defense Command, 12 May 1981, to more accurately reflect the extent of command&#x27;s responsibilities, keeping watch of activities in space over North America as well as those inside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

By virtue of Canada&#x27;s frontline position, the Canadian air defence command and control centre was deemed the most important piece of the NORAD &quot;pie&quot;, with respect to bombers. (North Bay was never involved in ballistic missile defence.) Its early warning of and reaction against a Soviet nuclear air attack were critical for the survival of the U.S.-Canadian portion of the North American continent. As one air force officer put it: &quot;(regarding a bomber attack) We lose North Bay, we lose the continent.&quot; Ergo, the centre was a prime target for a Soviet nuclear strike. To minimize the possibility of its destruction, planners decided to build the facility underground. It would be the only subterranean regional command and control centre in NORAD.

Following a cross-Canada survey of candidate sites, North Bay was selected for the following reasons:
# An air force base existed, eliminating the need to build one.
# The City of North Bay was a crossroad of rail, highway and telecommunications.
# The geology comprised a 2.6 billion year old rock formation altered 1.5 billion years ago by the Grenville Metamorphic Event into granite, one of the hardest rock types on the planet, excellent armour against a nuclear strike.
# Trout Lake, on the eastern edge of the city, presented an abundant source of water needed to cool the complex.

===Construction of the Underground Complex===
Construction of the Underground Complex (UGC) took four years, August 1959 to September 1963: years for excavation; years to build and outfit the centre. The cost was $51,000,000. One-third was paid by Canada, two-thirds by the U.S. Situated 60 storeys beneath the surface of the Earth (—deeper underground than most of the buildings in Toronto are tall—the facility was specially designed to withstand a 4-megaton nuclear blast, 267 times more powerful than the bomb dropped at Hiroshima.

Because its subterranean location complicated access by firefighting vehicles and personnel, the complex was fashioned from fire-retardant and fireproof materials, making it one of the most fire-safe structures in the country.

The complex (which still exists) comprises two sections. The &quot;Main Installation&quot; is a three-storey, figure-eight-shaped building inside a 430-foot-long (-wide (70.1 meter), 5.4-storey high ( cave. The &quot;Power Cavern&quot;, which provides life support and utility services to the complex, is a 401-foot-long (-wide (15.24 meter), 2.7-storey high ( chamber.

Access to the complex is via a 6,600-foot-long (2,012 meter) North Tunnel from the air base, and a 3,150-foot-long (960 meter) South Tunnel from the city. The tunnels meet; the idea was if a nuclear weapon struck the air base the blast would shoot down the North Tunnel and out the South Tunnel, minimizing blast damage to the complex and its structures. In fact, the three-storey Main Installation is mounted off the ground on specially designed pillars (not springs) to reduce seismic shock—on 1 January 2000, North Bay was hit by an earthquake registering 5.2 on the Richter magnitude scale, yet occupants in the Main Installation did not feel a thing.

As an added measure against damage from a nuclear blast, as well as for the security of the installation, the complex is situated behind three 19-ton steel bank vault-type doors. The doors are normally kept open, and shut in times of emergency. Despite weighing as much as a medium-size bulldozer, each door is so well balanced it can be moved effortlessly by a 12-year-old child.

===Features of the Underground Complex===
Air defence operations officially began in the UGC on 1 October 1963, and continued around-the-clock, unabated for 43 years until October 2006. There was nothing like it in NORAD (the Cheyenne Mountain Complex did not officially open until 1966) or in Canada, and it attracted worldwide interest. Its opening was reported in newspapers throughout the United States; it was the subject of numerous engineering publications; and visitors included the commander of the Japanese Air Self Defense Force, commander of the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia In its heyday about 700 Canadian and American military and civilian personnel worked in the centre, in day jobs and shift work. As well as air defence facilities, the Main Installation encompassed a barber shop, small medical centre, gym, cafeteria, chaplain&#x27;s office, and other amenities for the complex&#x27;s personnel (important since the complex was designed to seal up in time of war), plus a command post, intelligence centre, briefing rooms, a telephone switching network large enough to handle a town of 30,000 people, and a national civil defence warning centre.

When sealed up, the Underground Complex could support 400 people for upwards of four weeks cut off from the outside world. Since Canada would be the front line for the air defence of North America if the Cold War turned &quot;hot&quot;, it was crucial to ensure that air defence operations would continue as long as possible. A critical factor was electrical power. The complex gets its power from the outside civilian hydro-electric grid. In the event of a power failure, such as the August 2003 blackout that hobbled the northeast United States and Canada, two banks of 194 batteries automatically switch on and provide electricity to the complex while an electrical generator is readied to take the load. Once a generator is running, it can power the complex without stopping as long as it has fuel. The generator can also power key air base buildings on the Earth&#x27;s surface. Originally the complex had six 750-kilowatt generators. These were replaced in the 1990s by three 1.2-megawatt generators. Both types of generators could run on diesel or natural gas. If the Cold War had turned &quot;hot&quot;, and the complex sealed airtight and forced to use its generators for electrical power, the facility&#x27;s NORAD commander faced a harrowing choice. The original 750-kilowatt generators devoured air voraciously; in the sealed up environment of the complex, instead of weeks the generators would have cut life support for the complex&#x27;s personnel to a mere few hours, as the machines sucked away the breathable atmosphere. The commander could limit use of the generators to prolong his personnel&#x27;s survival, but a nuclear air attack would have demanded maximum power from all of the generators to support the complex&#x27;s air defence computers and electronics in order to repel the invaders, i.e. the commander and his personnel would be dead in hours. Luckily a crisis that called for such a choice to be made never arose during the Underground Complex&#x27;s 43 years.

The Underground Complex is colloquially referred to as &quot;The Hole&quot;. Although officially titled the Combat Centre/Direction Centre (CC/DC) Installation when it began air defence operations, during its construction it was known as the &quot;SAGE Installation, North Bay&quot;, a term still often used today. Canada and the United States combined are roughly twice the size of Europe—a Battle of Britain-style air defence network was too slow and unwieldy to protect such vast airspace in an age of jet aircraft and nuclear weapons. SAGE was a massive computer system that linked the ground elements of Canadian and American air defence—such as command and control centres, radar sites, and headquarters—providing high speed detection of aircraft, assistance in their rapid identification, and, when required, aiding quick Ground Controlled Interception of unknown, suspicious and hostile aircraft. Also, the SAGE system enabled the different NORAD regions and NORAD headquarters to interact seamlessly in their air defence activities and crises.

The Underground Complex&#x27;s SAGE computer equipment comprised a pair of computers, nicknamed &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, plus Maintenance &amp; Programming and Input &amp; Output areas. Combined, &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; weighed 275 tons (245.5 metric tonnes); encompassed 11,900 square feet of floor space (.273 acres, 1,105.5 square meters—the floorspace of a dozen small houses); and had a (then) staggering memory capacity of about 256K. When the Maintenance &amp; Programming and Input &amp; Output areas are included, total floor space used by SAGE was 18,810 sq ft (1,747.5 sq m – equal in size to about 20 small homes).

In 1982–1983, the SAGE computer system was replaced throughout NORAD by the &quot;Regional Operations Control Centre/Sector Operations Control Centre&quot; computer system. This long-winded term is abbreviated &quot;ROCC/SOCC&quot;. It was a faster, more versatile and, in particular, substantially smaller system. North Bay&#x27;s ROCC/SOCC total computer components took up the floor space equal to about two houses versus 20 for SAGE. North Bay&#x27;s SAGE computer system was also tied into Canada&#x27;s BOMARC nuclear-tipped air defence missiles. Cost to convert systems in North Bay was $96,000,000.

The ROCC/SOCC system remained in use in North Bay until air defence operations were moved out of the Underground Complex, in October 2006. The ROCC/SOCC system, better known as the FYQ-93 by the technicians who maintained it, was officially powered down by the last Aerospace Telecommunications and Information Systems Technician (ATIS Tech) to work on the system, Sergeant (then Corporal) Michael A. Dambrauskas. A ceremonial Shutdown was later performed by one of the ROCC/SOCC&#x27;s longest serving technicians, Master Warrant Officer (MWO) Jean-Pierre Paris. 

Due to its important, sensitive role in the security of Canada and North America, working in the Underground Complex was limited to very few people. Over its 43-year span in air defence operations only about 17,000 Canadian and American military personnel and civilians served in the UGC. Of this number approximately 15,500 were Canadians, out of nearly a million men and women over the same timeframe who were members of Canada&#x27;s Department of National Defence.

===NORAD regions at North Bay===
The Canada-United States portion of North America is colossal, about twice the size of Europe. To enable thorough, in-depth air defence operations over such a vast territory, NORAD divided its organization into divisions and regions. Each division and region was responsible to NORAD Headquarters in Colorado Springs for watching over and protecting the air sovereignty in their geographic chunk of Canada and/or the United States.

The Underground Complex was home to three successive NORAD regions. Each region was the largest in NORAD&#x27;s organization. The first was the &quot;Northern NORAD Region (NNR)&quot;, created with the formation of NORAD in 1957. Originally set up at Air Defence Command, at RCAF Station St. Hubert, an air base just south of Montreal, Quebec, the NNR was transferred to North Bay in 1962–1963 to operate in the then new Underground Complex. The NNR&#x27;s area of responsibility comprised the north, Atlantic and east-central airspaces of Canada, the frontline &quot;trenches&quot; of North America with respect to the Soviet Union, as well as the northern two-thirds of the state of Maine.

American NORAD regions oversaw air security for the rest of Canada. Because of the severe nature of the Cold War, everything that flew into the Northern NORAD Region had to be identified within two minutes by Underground Complex air defence personnel. If an aircraft was still unknown at two minutes, fighters were scrambled to intercept it, to find out why the aircraft could not be identified. If necessary, the fighters would force the aircraft to land at the nearest airfield, and the aircraft met by authorities. If hostile, the aircraft would be shot down.

From receiving notification from North Bay to scramble, the jet fighters had to be airborne within five minutes. Under certain conditions, 15 minutes or even one hour was permitted, but five minutes was the norm. To meet this requirement, jet fighters were positioned at air force bases across Canada and in Maine, fully fuelled and fully armed, 24 hours a day/seven days per week. They, and their pilots, were housed in special Quick Reaction Alert hangars (abbreviated &quot;QRA&quot;) at the end of runways. When North Bay contacted an air base for a scramble, simultaneously air traffic control on that base would halt and/or move aside all activity on the airfield. The fighter pilots would strap into and start their jets and the QRA&#x27;s doors opened, then the jets would taxi out to the runway and take off.

In effect, the total time from Northern NORAD Region detecting an aircraft to jet fighters taking off was seven minutes. Anything longer without an excellent reason was deemed unacceptable, and could result in disciplining by NORAD authorities of everyone involved in the operation.

In July 1969, NORAD underwent a continent-wide revamping of its organization. The Northern NORAD Region was redesignated as the &quot;22nd NORAD Region (22nd NR)&quot;, but its area of responsibility: north, Atlantic and east-central Canada and northern Maine—remained unaltered.

On 1 July 1983, the SAGE computer network at North Bay was officially switched off, and air defence operations taken over by the Underground Complex&#x27;s Regional Operations Control Center/Sector Operations Control Center (ROCC/SOCC) computer system. The ROCC/SOCC system was incorporated throughout NORAD, as well as in North Bay, and caused another wholesale re-arranging of North America&#x27;s air defences. In particular to Canada, the 22nd NORAD Region was replaced by the &quot;Canadian NORAD Region (CANR)&quot;, Maine was transferred to an American NORAD centre, and the Underground Complex given responsibility for monitoring and protection of the airspace of the entire country. Canadian Forces Base North Bay had become the most important air base in Canada, with respect to the defence of the country and the continent.

The Canadian NORAD Region still exists. Its headquarters moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, in April 1997, but air defence operations remained in North Bay.

In October 2006, Canadian NORAD Region air defence operations moved out of the Underground Complex into a new state-of-the-art installation built on the Earth&#x27;s surface, named the Sgt David L. Pitcher Building after a Canadian serviceman who was killed in the crash of a United States Air Force AWACS patrol plane, in 1995.

==BOMARC==

North Bay&#x27;s Underground Complex was also the command and control centre for two CIM-10 BOMARC surface-to-air missile squadrons in Canada. From 28 December 1961 – 31 March 1972, 446 Surface-to-Air Missile Squadron operated five miles (eight kilometres) north of the City of North Bay, at the site of a former RCAF radio station. The second squadron, 447 Surface-to-Missile Squadron, operated from a newly constructed site at La Macaza, Quebec. Each site was equipped with 29 BOMARC missiles: 28 for combat and a 29th for training purposes. The BOMARC was tipped with a 10-kiloton W-40 nuclear warhead (the bomb used at Hiroshima was 15 kilotons). In the event of a Soviet air attack on North America, some or all of the 56 missiles would have been launched into the air raids, and their nuclear warheads detonated, to destroy as many of the bombers as possible, while crippling surviving aircraft or &quot;cooking&quot; their bombs (rendering their nuclear devices inoperable) such that they could not complete their missions. The skies of central to eastern Canada would have been awash in Hiroshima-level detonations.

The BOMARCs were deployed in the United States as well as Canada. While U.S. missiles were controlled strictly by American authorities, the Canadian BOMARCs were an international affair. The missiles were under Canadian government control, the warheads controlled by the United States. Permission was required from both governments for a launch. To activate a missile for launch, a Canadian and American officer at the BOMARC site, and a Canadian and American officer in the Underground Complex simultaneously turned keys. To launch, the Canadian and American officers in the UGC, at separate consoles, pressed a button at the same time. The missile would then be guided by a controller at a SAGE console in the UGC, until from its target(s), then the BOMARC&#x27;s homing system would take over and steer the missile until detonation. No BOMARCs were launched in Canada; squadron personnel from North Bay and La Macaza fired missiles (non-nuclear warhead) at the Santa Rosa Island Test Facility, Florida.

Due to the nuclear nature of the missiles all potential Bomarc personnel underwent Human Reliability Program tests to weed out those with &quot;hidden idiosyncrasies, repressions, emotional disturbances, psychosomatic traits and even latent homosexuality&quot;. Their &quot;family, friends, past history, schooling, religion and travel experiences were also gone into&quot;.

From 1961 to the end of 1963, the BOMARCs were not equipped with their warheads due to government indecision as to whether to equip the Canadian military with nuclear weapons. In late 1963, nuclear weapons were finally approved by the federal government, and the warheads distributed to the sites between 31 December 1963 and early 1964. They were to remain under American control; therefore, a section of each site was fenced off and declared American territory. Here the warheads were stored and serviced when not on installed in the BOMARCs. Canadians were not permitted to enter the area; when time came to load it onto a missile, a small, special gate was opened in the American section and the warhead pushed through into the Canadian side. In 1972, during the disbanding of the BOMARC squadrons and closing of the two sites, the warheads were removed from Canada.

The missile site was sold to Canadore College, which used it as a flight and aircraft maintenance training centre.

==Canadian Forces Base North Bay==
RCAF Station North Bay was renamed the Canadian Forces Base North Bay (abbreviated &quot;CFB North Bay&quot;) on 1 April 1966 as part of the Canadian government&#x27;s plan to merge the country&#x27;s air force, army, and navy into a single entity: the Canadian Armed Forces. This plan, called &quot;Unification,&quot; came into effect on 1 February 1968. The word &quot;Armed&quot; was eventually removed, and the country&#x27;s military became the &quot;Canadian Forces,&quot; a term that was used for many years until the reintroduction of the word &quot;Armed&quot; coinciding with the 2011 change of the air and sea elements being individually renamed as the &quot;Royal Canadian Air Force&quot; and &quot;Royal Canadian Navy.&quot;

From December 1967 until August 1972, there were no flying units at CFB North Bay. The airfield portion of the base, at one time a thriving fighter station, fell largely into disuse. For example, one of its main hangars, employed to service and house heavily armed jet interceptors, was converted into an ice rink and saw year-round use by hockey leagues, figure skating clubs, and various other civilian entities in and around the City of North Bay.

===414 (Electronic Warfare) Squadron===
414 Squadron returned to CFB North Bay in August 1972. Deployed as an electronic warfare unit, the squadron trained flying and ground air defence personnel to fight a war when an enemy has disrupted radar systems and radio communications. Specializing in the jamming, interference, and &quot;stealing of radar and radio signals,&quot; the unit earned considerable renown, even notoriety, for its abilities. Its services were frequently requested by the navy and American armed forces.

Regarding the stealing of radar, the 414 Squadron personnel would electronically find and lock onto the radar set of a jet or a ground station, and take control of it. In stealing a radio communication frequency, 414 would pretend to be a fighter pilot or ground controller, and disrupt the air defence by doing things such as sending fighters in a wrong direction. A superb example of such stealing took place during a huge air exercise at Cold Lake, Alberta. A swarm of American and Canadian aircraft were divided into two teams. One team received command, control, and warnings of an enemy from a United States Air Force Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) jet, whose radar could monitor the entire battlefield. The crew of a 414 Squadron aircraft, the other team, was unable to break into the AWACS&#x27;s air defence radio frequencies, but instead managed to contact the pilot and convince him that the AWACS had to return immediately to their home base at Tinker, Oklahoma. Off the AWACS flew, leaving their team to fend for themselves. 
In July 1992, 414 Squadron was split into two units and posted to the east and west coasts of Canada. It was the last military flying unit in North Bay. Thereafter, all of the base&#x27;s airfield facilities were either demolished or sold, and CFB North Bay became the only air base in Canada not to have any military flying whatsoever. The federal government considered the possibility of shutting down the facility altogether.

===22 Wing===
On 1 April 1993, all Canadian air bases were dubbed &quot;wings&quot; to restore an air force cachet to the installations, lost when the Canadian government lumped the army, navy and air force into a single military force in 1968. North Bay&#x27;s base became &quot;22 Wing/Canadian Forces Base North Bay&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;22 Wing/CFB North Bay&quot;. It is often referred to simply as &quot;22 Wing&quot;. The number &quot;22&quot; was chosen for North Bay to honour the old 22nd NORAD Region. 

One of the units at the base was 22 Radar Control Wing, which evolved out of a unit called the &quot;Radar Control Wing&quot;. The Radar Control Wing was created by the air force in 1987 to run day-to-day air defence operations in the Underground Complex for the Canadian NORAD Region. When an extraordinary event occurred or was about to occur, such as the approach to Canada of Soviet bombers, the Radar Control Wing alerted the Canadian NORAD Region, and the region&#x27;s general and selected members of his staff would man a command post on the second floor of the Underground Complex. The Radar Control Wing and command post would then coordinate their efforts to handle the situation. For example, regarding Soviet bombers, while the Radar Control Wing saw to such activities as intercepting the aircraft and coordinating with civilian air traffic control in the area of the interception to avoid running into airliners, the command post would advise and consult with NORAD Headquarters in Colorado Springs, arrange an AWACS aircraft to assist, if deemed useful, and talk with the adjacent American NORAD region if it looked like the intercepted aircraft would enter their area, too.

When the Radar Control Wing was created, it was given command of the Sector Operations Control Centre East, which watched the eastern half of Canada from the Atlantic Ocean to the Manitoba border, and the Sector Operations Control Centre West, which oversaw Canadian skies from Manitoba to the Pacific Ocean.

In June 1989, the wing was renamed &quot;22 Radar Control Wing&quot;. Simultaneously, the eastern control centre was renamed 21 Aerospace Control and Warning Squadron and the western centre became 51 Aerospace Control &amp; Warning Squadron. Although it resided on CFB North Bay, and the base provided such things as pay, clothing and medical services, 22 Radar Control Wing was an entirely separate entity from the base with its own commander and staff of personnel.

In 1992, CFB North Bay and 22 Radar Control Wing were amalgamated under a single commander and command staff, but the base was still officially CFB North Bay. The wing and the base remained as separate organizations until united into 22 Wing/CFB North Bay in April 1993.
===Near-death of the base, massive reductions and their effects on North Bay===
As well as divesting the base of the airfield following 414 Squadron&#x27;s departure in 1992, the Canadian government embarked on the wholesale demolition of CFB North Bay&#x27;s non-airfield buildings and facilities, and dramatically slashed the numbers of civilian and military base personnel. Finally, the Canadian government announced it was closing the base, and the destruction of the base and reduction of its personnel accelerated.

This decision to close the base was monumental from a military standpoint since North Bay was the nerve center for the air defence of the country, and intricately tied into the United States in the air defence network of the continent. Somehow this huge, complex, deeply entrenched system for national and continental air defence would have to be transposed en masse to another base, yet no other base in Canada had the means in place to receive the system.

From the non-military perspective, the decision had a seismic effect on the civilian community. CFB North Bay was the adjoining city&#x27;s biggest industry. Between hiring employees from the community, contracting work on the base (such as roofing upgrades to its buildings), making purchases in local businesses, plus the money spent by its personnel and their family members, CFB North Bay infused tens of millions of dollars into the community annually. Already, due to the drop off of income from reductions to the base and its number of personnel, dozens of restaurants, shops and other businesses had folded. Exacerbating the situation the City of North Bay was being hit by another financial hammer—massive cutbacks to its fifth largest industry, the railways. Therefore, the base&#x27;s closing was perceived by the community as catastrophic, and North Bay political, business and civic leaders launched a vocal, dogged, energetic campaign to persuade the Canadian government to reverse the decision. They succeeded. On 8 May 1998, Minister of National Defence the Honourable Art Eggleton visited North Bay and announced that the base would stay open indefinitely.

Despite the reprieve, the Minister stated that drastic cuts to the base were to continue. Manpower on the base, once numbering 2,200 military and civilian employees, was 530 when the announcement was made; the Minister remarked that another 100 personnel would be cut, and the base&#x27;s infrastructure, at one time well over 100 buildings, was to be chopped to five, plus the air defence centre.

==Re-Shaping of 22 Wing/Canadian Forces Base North Bay &amp; the 21st Century==
22 Wing/CFB North Bay has continued as the centre for the air defence of the country, and partner with the United States in NORAD guarding the air sovereignty of the continent. In the late 1990s plans were enacted for a new air defence facility to replace the aging Underground Complex. The complex&#x27;s air defence electronic, communications and computer systems—the leading edge of early 1980s technology—had become antiquated, struggling to cope with the demands and crises of an Internet Age world. Moreover, the cost of operating the decades-old, shopping centre-size subterranean complex was rapidly becoming prohibitive. 

On 20 August 2003, Prime Minister the Right Honourable Jean Chrétien turned soil inaugurating the construction of a new above ground complex. Three years later, 12 October 2006, 43 years and 11 days after the Underground Complex&#x27;s birth, a new surface installation was opened by Minister of National Defence, the Honorable Gordon O&#x27;Connor, officially taking the baton of air defence operations from the Underground Complex. The new installation was named the Sgt David L. Pitcher Building, in honour of a Canadian Forces Air Defence Technician who was killed in the crash of a Boeing E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, call sign Yukla 27, at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, on 22 September 1995. The aircraft ingested birds into two of its four engines during takeoff; all 24 crew members were killed.

===End of Air Defence Operations in the Underground Complex===
On 26 October 2006, the Base Commander Colonel Rick Pitre led a parade of personnel in a ceremonial march-out of the Underground Complex, symbolically closing out all military operations in the Underground Complex for good. Since then the UGC has been maintained in &quot;warm storage&quot;. All of its furniture, effects and equipment were removed except for the environmental controls, equipment and machinery in the Power Cavern. The Power Cavern (life support for the Underground Complex) has continued to provide heat, ventilation, air conditioning and other utility operations to prevent the complex from falling into decay. It is hoped that the complex will be leased or bought; it is one of the most secure, fire-safe facilities in the country, endowed with precision environmental controls that are ideal for certain uses such as an archives storage.

One option that arose: after three years of visits and discussions with DND and the base the Canadian motion picture company Alcina Pictures shot part of a science fiction movie in the Underground Complex. The low budget production, called &quot;The Colony&quot;, stars Laurence Fishburne, Bill Paxton and Kevin Zegers. In 2007, the base began entertaining the idea of using the UGC as a site for motion picture and television productions as a means to help offset its operating cost. Maintaining the UGC in warm storage required an outlay of $1,500 per day, with no foreseeable sale or lease of the site on the horizon, and many visitors had remarked about the Dr. Strangelove/mad scientist&#x27;s lair look of the complex. The Ontario Media Development Corporation was subsequently contacted by the base, and representatives given a comprehensive tour. &quot;The Colony&quot; resulted, but, the requirements of security, logistics and other operations of the base for the movie proved staggering. The Underground Complex will not be used in this capacity again.

In 2005, the Main Installation and Power Cavern were designated as Federal Heritage Buildings, &quot;Control Building 55&quot; and &quot;Power Cavern 53&quot;, on the Register of the Government of Canada Heritage Buildings.

===NORAD Air Defence organization today===
In 2000, the air defence aspect at 22 Wing/CFB North Bay was given the title &quot;Canadian Air Defence Sector&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;CADS&quot;. As a result, NORAD air defence in Canada in the 21st Century is organized as follows:

Canada and the United States are divided into three NORAD Regions: the Alaskan NORAD Region, the Continental U.S. NORAD Region and the Canadian NORAD Region. Headquarters of the Canadian NORAD Region is in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Canadian NORAD Region operations center, which watches the skies and reacts to problems in the air, is the Canadian Air Defence Sector, at North Bay. The CADS was originally situated in the Underground Complex; as described above it moved above ground in October 2006, into the building named after Sergeant David L. Pitcher.

CADS is just one of many parts of 22 Wing/Canadian Forces Base North Bay. 21 Aerospace Control and Warning Squadron is the unit in CADS that carries out the air sovereignty of Canada. 51 Aerospace Control and Warning Operational Training Squadron is the operational training unit in CADS. It trains and tests military personnel in the various jobs and duties of air defence, as well as such non-air defence activities as first-aid and small arms handling.

===North Bay Air Defence Operations in the 21st Century===
The end of the Cold War on Christmas Day 1991 stirred many arguments in Canada and internationally that an era of global safety from major threats had arrived, and entities like NORAD were no longer needed. However, the al-Qaeda attacks of 11 September 2001 (colloquially known as the &quot;9/11&quot; attacks) against New York City and Washington, D.C. proved the necessity of continued surveillance and defence of North American skies, that attacks to the continent can come from anywhere, at any time, and in a least expected manner.

In another vivid example, on 11 September 2001, a Korean Air Flight 85 Boeing 747 en route to New York City from Seoul, Korea, headed to Anchorage, Alaska, for a refuelling stop, was ordered to land at Whitehorse, Yukon Territory. First, while making towards Anchorage, the crew had sent a text message to its airline including the letters &quot;HJK&quot;, code for hijack, which prompted a scramble of two F-15s.

F-15s from Elmendorf Air Force Base by the Alaskan NORAD Region to intercept the jet, and Alaskan air traffic control to ask the Korean Air pilots via coded questions if they had been hijacked. During this exchange, the Korean pilots, supposedly on the instructions of ATC, set their transponder to 7500, which officially declared themselves hijacked. The Alaskan NORAD Region advised ATC they would shoot down the airliner if it flew near any significant ground targets, such as a city. ATC ordered the Korean crew to fly to Whitehorse instead, avoiding all populated centers in Alaska.

When the airliner and F-15s entered Canadian airspace they also entered the Canadian NORAD Region, thus came under the watch and control of the Canadian Air Defence Sector at 22 Wing/CFB North Bay. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien gave his permission to the Canadian NORAD Region Commander in Winnipeg: if the situation warranted North Bay could order the F-15s to shoot down Korean Air Flight 85. Fortunately the airliner landed without incident at Whitehorse. Royal Canadian Mounted Police boarded the aircraft; their investigation and interrogation of the pilots revealed no hijack, the incident apparently resulting from misunderstandings in the communications between the crew and Alaskan ATC.

22 Wing/CFB North Bay has been a participant in Operation Noble Eagle (abbreviated &quot;ONE&quot;) since the operation was created by the United States on 14 September 2001, as a result of 9/11. ONE&#x27;s purpose is to watch for and defend against similar air threats. For example, on 5 February 2006 the Canadian Air Defence Sector at 22 Wing/CFB North Bay provided air defence security over the Windsor, Ontario-Detroit, Michigan area, in support of Super Bowl XL, played in Detroit, and on 10 April 2012, a Korean Air Boeing 777 that had taken off from Vancouver International Airport was intercepted by F-15s under North Bay&#x27;s control and diverted to 19 Wing/Canadian Forces Base Comox, British Columbia, after a bomb threat was reported against the airliner. The USAF F-15s had been scrambled from Portland, Oregon, in NORAD&#x27;s Western Air Defense Sector (Continental U.S. NORAD Region), instead of RCAF CF-18s from Canada because the United States Air Force fighters were closer to the Korean airliner. Since NORAD is bi-national, Canadian and American interceptors routinely work with each other&#x27;s NORAD air defence centers.

North Bay has also provided air defence security for many events unrelated to Operation Noble Eagle, such as the 2002 G8 Summit at Kananaskis, Alberta, the 2010 G8/G20 Summit at Huntsville and Toronto, Ontario and the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. For the latter, for the first time in its history, in order to meet any threats posed by slow speed aircraft, North Bay&#x27;s NORAD controllers trained to carry out Ground Controlled Interceptions of helicopters.

In August 2007, a Russian submarine planted a one-meter titanium Russian flag on the sea bottom at the geographic North Pole, both as a propaganda venture and as a hint at the country&#x27;s mindset towards the untapped multibillion-dollar oil and gas fields beneath the Arctic ice. That September, the Russians followed up by resuming Bear bomber flights along the northern fringe of North American airspace. Their aircraft have been intercepted both by the Alaskan NORAD Region and by Canadian CF-18 and American F-15 fighters controlled by the CADS at 22 Wing/CFB North Bay.

On 30 January 2014, North Bay officially added space surveillance to its operations. In 2010 its NORAD operations had taken the first steps to prepare for this new responsibility, forming a Space Surveillance Operations Centre (SSOC) that would act as part of the United States Space Surveillance Network. Sapphire, Canada&#x27;s first military satellite, had been originally slated for a Russian rocket, but the washing machine-size craft was allocated to India in 2008–09. In 2010 two Indian rockets carrying commercial payloads went out of control and exploded, setting back scheduled launches—including Sapphire—years. After a continuous string of postponements the satellite was finally launched in February 2013. For the year of 2014, following its Final Operational Certification on 30 January, Sapphire delivered 1.2 million observations of space objects to the surveillance network.

In 2017, the Canadian Broadcast Museum Foundation announced that it was in negotiations to take over the underground bunker as a storage repository for the country&#x27;s audiovisual broadcasting archives.

&quot;Little&quot; departed Norfolk, Virginia, on 5 May 1918 for convoy escort duty with Patrol Force, Coast of France, and operated from Brest until she sailed for home on 26 December. During this period she escorted President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s party to Europe to attend the Paris Peace Conference.

The ship arrived Boston, Massachusetts, on 18 January 1919 for drydock and operations with Destroyer Force, Atlantic. She escorted the president&#x27;s party back into New York City from 6 to 8 July, and then engaged in tactical exercises, she was transferred to Reserve Status with ComDesRon 3 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 17 November, where she remained until 4 January 1921. The ship then operated along the Atlantic coast until she returned to Philadelphia and decommissioned 5 July 1922.

Converted to a high-speed transport by having two boilers removed and converted to troop quarters, &quot;Little&quot; was redesignated APD-4, 2 August 1940, and recommissioned 4 November 1940. She sailed for the Caribbean in February 1941 for maneuvers with the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, and then steamed to San Diego, California, where she arrived on 9 March for amphibious training. The ship returned to the east coast in late summer, and arrived at Norfolk on 1 December for drydocking.

As flagship for TransDiv 12, she departed for San Diego on 14 February 1942 for repairs and alterations. Upon completion of amphibious landing exercises in April, she steamed for Pearl Harbor. A short cruise to Midway Island in late June preceded her departure to New Caledonia on 7 July for the Solomons campaign.

Supplies for American troops on Guadalcanal had been badly disrupted by the Battle of Savo Island on 9 August 1942. High-speed destroyer-transports were called upon to remedy this shortage. As she discharged stores and Marine Raiders on the Guadalcanal beaches on 30 August, &quot;Little&quot; witnessed the destruction of by enemy aircraft.

The three remaining APDs, &quot;Little&quot;, , and , continued to support and help supply the Marines. On 4 September, &quot;Little&quot; and &quot;Gregory&quot; brought a detachment of Marine Raiders to Savo Island on an unfounded rumor that enemy forces had occupied it. The troops were returned to Lunga Point, Guadalcanal. That night was unusually dark, so Division Commander Hugh W. Hadley decided to patrol off Lunga Point rather than attempt to negotiate Tulagi Harbor with no visible landmarks.

About 0100 on 5 September, &quot;Little&quot; observed gun flashes to the east and believed this to be an enemy submarine. Moments later a Navy PBY Catalina flying over Savo Sound released a string of five flares to illuminate what he also thought was a submarine. The flares illuminated the APDs instead. A surprised Japanese surface destroyer force, engaged in shelling Henderson Field after delivering a &quot;Tokyo Express&quot; shipment of troops and supplies to Guadalcanal and the source of the flashes presumed to have come from a submarine, shifted their guns toward the APDs, and searchlights stabbed through the darkness. Though outgunned, &quot;Little&quot; opened fire on enemy destroyers, , and , but took direct hits from salvos which left her helpless and ablaze by 0115. &quot;Gregory&quot; suffered the same fate. The Japanese, to assure their kill, steamed between the two stricken ships firing shells and strafing survivors. &quot;Gregory&quot; sank stern first about 0140. &quot;Little&quot; went down on an even keel about two hours later. Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz paid sincere tribute to these gallant ships: &quot;With little means, the ships performed duties vital to the success of the campaign.&quot; 65 officers and men from &quot;Little&quot;, including the commanding officer of Transport Division 12 and the commanding officer of &quot;Little&quot; were killed.

==Awards==
&quot;Little&quot; received two battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="511998" wikidata="Q10424479" url="?curid=511998" title="Money (album)">
<text>Money is the fifth studio album by German industrial band KMFDM, released in February 1992 by Wax Trax! Records. It was originally intended to be titled &quot;Apart&quot;, with each of the two core members, Sascha Konietzko and En Esch, recording half an album and combining their work. The album ended up using only Konietzko&#x27;s half, along with additional songs. It received mixed reviews, but spawned a number of club hits. It went out of print in the late 1990s and was re-released in 2006.

==History==
Bandmates Sascha Konietzko and En Esch had a falling out at the end of their 1990 tour with My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult. Each was given the funds to record one side of their next (and presumed final, at the time) album, &quot;Apart&quot;. Both worked in the same Hamburg studio, M.O.B., with engineer Blank Fontana and guitarist Günter Schulz, but never interacted with each other directly. These sessions would be the last time the group worked with Fontana at M.O.B.

After the two halves were combined and pressed onto an album, Esch&#x27;s half was rejected by Wax Trax! Records&#x27;s executives, who didn&#x27;t think it sounded like KMFDM. The record company gave Konietzko additional funds to record more songs. He finished the album by including new remixes of previously released material. After yet another tracklist revision by Konietzko, he changed the title to &quot;Money&quot;, and later reconciled with Esch in the later stages of the album&#x27;s production. A number of other tracks intended for the album ended up on other albums or singles.

The album cover includes a self-portrait of long time KMFDM artist Aidan Hughes, who appears as the man on the left side of the cover. The album&#x27;s cover came about after Hughes experienced &quot;artistic block&quot; because he usually tried to base his artwork on the music as closely as possible; Konietzko allowed him more freedom to create cover art, so Hughes became inspired to create the cover for &quot;Money&quot; based on his own personal experience instead. Hughes related that the image represents &quot;my disillusionment with the street lifestyle I was experiencing at the time, and the art carries with it the implication that no matter what temptation lies in your path, you still gotta pay!&quot;

===&quot;Apart&quot; tracks===
&quot;Apart&quot; (the second version, which did not include Esch&#x27;s solo songs) would have included:

A1 Vogue/Govern Your Soul 5:26 (version released as part of the &quot;Wax Trax! Industrial Accident&quot; documentary soundtrack)

A2 Split 4:20 (version released as &quot;Split-Apart&quot;, which appeared on the &quot;Vogue&quot; single)

A3 Help Us/Save Us/Take Us Away 5:53 (same as the final released version on &quot;Money&quot;)

A4 Blood 5:10 (original version that was later released on the &quot;A Drug Against War&quot; single albeit a minute longer)

B1 Thank You 0:43 (later included on the rarities compilation &quot;Agogo&quot;)

B2 Spiritual House 5:01 (slightly different version than the final release)

B3 Bargeld 6:11 (version released as &quot;Bargeld (Cashflow Mix)&quot;, which appeared on the &quot;Help Us/Save Us/Take Us Away&quot; single)

B4 Sex on the Flag 4:17 (same as the final released version on &quot;Money&quot;)

B5 We Must Awaken 4:53 (same as the final released version on &quot;Money&quot;)

This particular version of &quot;Apart&quot; was released by KMFDM&#x27;s online store in early 2020 as a download, after it had been leaked onto the internet.

==Release==
&quot;Money&quot; was released in February 1992. It spawned two club hits, the title track and &quot;Vogue&quot;, both of which charted on the Billboard Dance/Club Play Songs Chart a few months later. KMFDM toured twice in support of the album: first on a mini-tour in June, and again on a full tour in October and November.

==Reception==

&quot;Money&quot; received mixed reviews. Alex Henderson of Allmusic called it &quot;excellent&quot; and stated that &quot;a blistering metal guitar, distorted industrial vocals, and a syncopated dance beat could indeed be united into a cohesive, exciting whole&quot;. Rick Roos from &quot;The Tech&quot; said &quot;The main problem with the album is its lack of new material&quot;. He noted that there were only seven new tracks, and that the rest were either remixes or remakes of songs from &quot;Naïve&quot;, KMFDM&#x27;s previous album. However, he said that the new tracks were &quot;for the most part aggressive, ferocious songs... with surprisingly strong musicianship&quot;. He called &quot;Sex on the Flag&quot; the album&#x27;s best song, and its chorus &quot;addictive&quot;. He also said that the album&#x27;s first two tracks were &quot;exceptional and entertaining&quot;. He concluded by calling the album &quot;very strong and fierce but... actually quite easy to listen to&quot;.

Chuck Eddy of &quot;Spin&quot; magazine was less complimentary. He said KMFDM was &quot;concentrating on atmosphere now, not songs&quot;. He went on to say that &quot;there are some neat little touches&quot;, but that &quot;the drone-y dinks barely coalesce into hooks&quot;. His final thought was that &quot;novelty bands should learn to stick to novelty&quot;.

==Tour==
KMFDM supported the release of &quot;Money&quot; with two tours in 1992: the three-week Aloha Jerry Brown tour in June and the two-month Sucks Money tour in October and November. At the band&#x27;s Boston show on 23 October at Man Ray, the show had to be temporarily halted due to damage to the floor&#x27;s support beams because of the crowd&#x27;s synchronized jumping.

<text>Lacey Nicole Chabert ( ; born September 30, 1982) is an American actress. One of her first roles as a child actress was the part of Bianca Montgomery, the daughter of Erica Kane, on &quot;All My Children&quot; from 1992 to 1993. She gained further prominence for her portrayal of Claudia Salinger in the Fox television drama &quot;Party of Five&quot; (1994–2000).

In film, she has appeared in &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1998), &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot; (2001), and &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot; (2003); and had leading roles as Gretchen Wieners in &quot;Mean Girls&quot; (2004), Meg Cummings in &quot;Dirty Deeds&quot; (2005), Dana Mathis in the horror remake &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (2006), and Penelope in the animated film &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot; (2017). Chabert has also appeared in more than 40 Hallmark Channel films.

== Early life ==
Lacey Nicole Chabert was born on September 30, 1982 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and raised in nearby Purvis. Her father is Cajun from Louisiana. She has a younger brother, Tony, and an older sister, Chrissy. Their oldest sister, Wendy, died of a heart attack in November 2021. Lacey was &quot;World&#x27;s Baby Petite&quot; in the &quot;World&#x27;s Our Little Miss Scholarship Competition&quot; in 1985. She also participated in beauty pageants as a child and was once named Miss Jr. Mississippi.

== Acting career ==

=== 1985–2003: Beginnings and breakthrough with &quot;Party of Five&quot; ===
Some of Chabert&#x27;s earliest roles were in television commercials for Burger King, Triaminic Cough Syrup, Zest and Secret Beauties dolls. In 1992–93, Chabert played the role of young Cosette in &quot;Les Misérables&quot; on Broadway. She appeared on The Broadway Kids&#x27; first album &quot;The Broadway Kids Sing Broadway&quot; (1994), where she sang her own solos on such songs as &quot;The Girl I Mean to Be&quot; (from &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;) and &quot;Castle on a Cloud&quot; (from &quot;Les Misérables&quot;). In 1994, she landed the role of Claudia Salinger on the Fox network teen/family drama series &quot;Party of Five&quot;. The show centered on the five Salinger siblings, who are orphaned after their parents are killed in a car accident caused by a drunk driver. The show received positive reviews and ran for six seasons, from September 12, 1994 to May 3, 2000. She won &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;&#x27;s annual YoungStar Award for Best Performance by a Young Actress in a Drama TV Series in both 1997 and 1998 for &quot;Party of Five&quot;, and was nominated three other times for her work in 1999 to 2000. The YoungStar awards honor the best film, TV, and music performances made exclusively by 6- to 18-year-olds.

Chabert made her big-screen debut starring as Penny Robinson in &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1998). She then had a supporting role as Amanda Becker in the parody film &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot; (2001), and provided the voice of Aleu, the title character&#x27;s daughter, in &quot;Balto 2: Wolf Quest&quot; (2002).
In addition to her animation voice work as Eliza Thornberry from 1998–2004, Chabert was the voice of Meg Griffin, uncredited, on the first season of &quot;Family Guy&quot; in 1999, after which Mila Kunis took over the role when Chabert became too busy with schooling and her other work.

=== 2004–2013: Film success and television roles ===

Chabert co-starred as Gretchen Wieners, the girl who tries to make her slang term &quot;fetch&quot; catch on, in the hit film &quot;Mean Girls&quot; (2004). She and her co-stars Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams and Amanda Seyfried went on to win the 2005 MTV Movie Award for &quot;Best On-Screen Team&quot;. 
Chabert also played the title role in &quot;The Brooke Ellison Story&quot;, a 2004 television biopic produced and directed by Christopher Reeve, based on a real-life quadriplegic woman who overcame obstacles to graduate from Harvard University. 

Chabert then appeared in &quot;Hello Sister, Goodbye Life&quot; (2006) on ABC Family; had a role in a 2006 remake of the 1974 horror film &quot;Black Christmas&quot;, and in an episode of &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot; opposite former &quot;Party of Five&quot; co-star Jennifer Love Hewitt. Her voice work in the second half of the decade included the roles of Princess Elise in the video game &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and Gwen Stacy in &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; animated series.

=== 2014–present: Focus on &quot;Hallmark&quot; films ===
From 2013 to 2014, Chabert had a recurring role on the ABC Family sitcom &quot;Baby Daddy&quot; as Dr. Amy Shaw. In 2015, she starred in the television film &quot;A Christmas Melody&quot; alongside Mariah Carey, Brennan Elliott, Kathy Najimy and Fina Strazza. It was viewed by 3.95 million people when it debuted on the Hallmark Channel on December 19, 2015. In 2017, she provided her voice to the animated film &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot;, based on the book of the same title, written by Carey and Colleen Madden. The film also stars the voices of Carey, Breanna Yde and Henry Winkler.
She began 2018 with another Hallmark Channel original movie as part of its Valentine&#x27;s Day Countdown.

A second commercial, titled &quot;Gretchen&#x27;s Wednesday&quot;, was entirely centered around Chabert&#x27;s character Gretchen Wieners and her family life. On November 27, 2023, it was announced that Chabert was working on an unscripted Hallmark project, &quot;Celebrations with Lacey Chabert&quot;, which premiered on Hallmark+ on September 10, 2024. She was also credited as an executive producer of the series. On May 13, 2024, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Chabert has a lead role in the Netflix holiday film &quot;Hot Frosty&quot;.

<doc id="512008" wikidata="Q5975567" url="?curid=512008" title="High-speed transport">
<text>High-speed transports were converted destroyers and destroyer escorts used in US Navy amphibious operations in World War II and afterward. They received the US Hull classification symbol APD; &quot;AP&quot; for transport and &quot;D&quot; for destroyer. In 1969, the remaining ships were reclassified as &quot;Fast Amphibious Transports&quot;, hull symbol LPR.

APDs were intended to deliver small units such as Marine Raiders, Underwater Demolition Teams, and United States Army Rangers onto hostile shores. An APD could carry up to 200 troops - a company-size unit - and approximately 40 tons of cargo. It could also provide gunfire support if needed. was officially designated the Navy&#x27;s first high-speed transport on 2 August 1940 when she became APD-1.

== Development ==
Before the United States entered World War II, as newer and more modern destroyers joined the fleet, some older destroyers were refitted for other duties: as seaplane tenders, destroyer minelayers, or destroyer minesweepers, and in an innovation, as fast transports carrying fully equipped troops for assault landings. During the war, newly built or unfinished destroyer escorts were converted to APDs.

===&quot;Flush-deck&quot; conversions===
The first group of APDs (APD-1 through APD-36) were converted from one , 17 , and 14 &quot;flush-deck&quot; destroyers built during and after World War I. Some of these had been previously converted to aircraft tenders or other uses.

In the conversion, the two forward boilers (out of four) were removed along with their smokestacks (reducing speed to ). Accommodation for 200 troops was installed in the former engine spaces. The original armament of four 4&quot;/50 low-angle guns, one 3&quot;/23 anti-aircraft gun, and twelve 21-inch torpedo tubes was replaced with three modern 3&quot;/50 dual-purpose guns, one 40 mm AA gun, and five 20 mm AA guns. Two depth charge racks and up to six K-gun depth charge throwers were carried. In place of the torpedo mounts, four davit-mounted LCPLs (Landing Craft Personnel, Large) were shipped. Later, the LCPLs were replaced by a version with a bow ramp, the LCPR (Landing Craft Personnel, Ramped).

===Destroyer Escort (DE) conversions===
====&quot;Buckley&quot;-class conversions====
The second group of APDs were converted from 43 s (DE)s built in 1943-1945. Two further planned conversions were canceled at the end of the war. 
These converted vessels were known as the &quot;Charles Lawrence&quot; class.

In the conversion, the superstructure was expanded to provide accommodation for 162 troops. The original gun armament of three 3&quot;/50 DP guns and two 40 mm AA guns in a twin mount was replaced with one 5&quot;/38 DP gun and six 40 mm AA guns in three twin mounts. The original six 20mm AA guns were retained. 
The &quot;Charles Lawrence&quot; class also had two depth charge racks and up to eight K-guns. Typically, the converted DEs carried four LCVPs (Landing Craft Vehicle and Personnel) in a stacked davit configuration.

====&quot;Rudderow&quot;-class conversions====
The third group of APDs were converted from 51 s built in 1943-1945. All but one of these were converted while under construction. These converted vessels were known as the .

This conversion was the same as the &quot;Buckley&quot; class, except that the original &quot;Rudderow&quot; low bridge was retained as compared with the higher bridge of the &quot;Buckley&quot; Destroyer Escorts.

==World War II service==
In the Guadalcanal Campaign, neither side enjoyed the overwhelming local naval and air supremacy which ensured victory in every other amphibious operation of the war. This necessitated an increase in the number of high-speed transports, hybrid warships which combined the functions of transports and destroyers. The concept of the high-speed transport embodied sufficient armament for the ship to defend herself against smaller warships and to support the troops she carried.

APDs performed arduous service. They transported troops to beachheads, served as escorts for transports and supply vessels, conducted anti-submarine patrols and survey duties, operated with Underwater Demolition Teams and commando units, performed messenger and transport duties, conveyed passengers and mail to and from forward units, and were involved in minesweeping operations. They were attacked by submarines, surface ships and aircraft (including kamikazes), and many were damaged or sunk.

== After World War II ==
Nine &quot;flush deck&quot; APDs were lost during the war. The remaining 23 were scrapped in 1945-1946.

Some of the &quot;Charles Lawrence&quot;-class and &quot;Crosley&quot;-class APDs saw service in the Korean War and Vietnam War.

One &quot;Charles Lawrence&quot;-class APD was lost during World War II. 14 were transferred to foreign navies in the 1960s. One was sold for commercial use as a floating power station. 26 were scrapped. On 1 January 1969, the remaining three were reclassified as &quot;Fast Amphibious Transports&quot; (LPR).

No &quot;Crosley&quot;-class APD was lost during World War II. 18 were transferred to foreign navies. One (APD-106) was lost in a collision in 1966. Eight were sold as floating power stations. 18 were scrapped. In 1969, the remaining eight were reclassified as &quot;Fast Amphibious Transports&quot; (LPR).

==Japanese WWII fast transports==
The Imperial Japanese Navy also built fast destroyer-transports. The Japanese had used unmodified destroyers to act as ad-hoc fast transports in the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot;, sailing down &quot;The Slot&quot; to drop supplies during the Guadalcanal campaign; these destroyers would tow supply barges or just drop supplies overboard in buoyant steel drums before racing back to their bases.
This method saw considerable wastage, and the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to order the design of the Number 1 (or T1) class of purpose-build fast destroyer transports (earlier, two Minekaze-class destroyers had been converted to fast destroyer transports). These new ships were based on the Matsu-class destroyer, with the stern sloping down to the waterline to allow fast deployment of Daihatsu landing craft or other boats, amphibious tanks, or cargo. However, by the time these were operational, they had limited use for a navy that was no longer involved in far-flung offensive operations.

<text>Gayle Kawaipuna Prejean (April 14, 1943 – April 14, 1992) 
was a Hawaiian nationalist, activist and advocate for the Hawaiian sovereignty movement. Prejean was founder of the Hawaiian Coalition of Native Claims, now known as the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation.

A pioneer of sovereignty during the &quot;Hawaiian Renaissance&quot; of the 1970s, Prejean was one of the first voices to advocate for Kanaka Maoli (native Hawaiian) independence at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. He was involved in the formation of the movement to stop the bombing of the island of Kahoolawe by the U.S. Navy; this was an issue which catalyzed the formation of the modern &quot;Hawaiian Movement&quot;.

Prejean was known for his music and &quot;stand-up&quot; comedy as well as for his unrelenting criticism of the U.S. military presence in Hawaii. It was Kawaipuna Prejean who originally proposed the convening of the 1993 Kanaka Maoli Tribunal, and other historical actions which were carried out after his death.

Kawaipuna Prejean died on his 49th birthday while fighting to stop the construction of Interstate H-3, which destroyed many ancient Hawaiian sites and substantially impacted native species along its path on the island of Oahu, including several probable extinctions.

<text>USS &quot;Gregory&quot; (DD-82/APD-3) was a in the United States Navy during World War I and, as APD-3 World War II. She was named for Admiral Francis Gregory USN (1780–1866). She was converted into a high-speed transport during World War II and was sunk by Japanese warships.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Gregory&quot; was laid down by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company at Quincy, Massachusetts, on 25 August 1917, launched on 27 January 1918 by Mrs. George S. Trevor, great-granddaughter of Admiral Gregory, and commissioned on 1 June 1918, Commander Arthur P. Fairfield in command.

==Service history==

===World War I===
Joining a convoy at New York, &quot;Gregory&quot; sailed for Brest, France, 25 June 1918. She spent the final summer of the war escorting convoys from the French port to various Allied ports in Britain and France. As the war neared its close, &quot;Gregory&quot; was assigned to the patrol squadron at Gibraltar 2 November 1918. In addition to patrolling in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, &quot;Gregory&quot; carried passengers and supplies to the Adriatic and aided in the execution of the terms of the Austrian armistice. After six months of this duty, the flush-deck destroyer joined naval forces taking part in relief missions to the western Mediterranean 28 April 1919. In company with the battleship , &quot;Gregory&quot; carried supplies and passengers to Smyrna, Constantinople, and Batum. She then sailed for Gibraltar with the American consul from Tiflis, Russia and some British army officers. She offloaded her passengers on the rocky fortress; &quot;Gregory&quot; sailed for New York reaching the United States 13 June 1919.

===Inter-War period===

After brief tours in reserve at Tompkinsville, New York, the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and the Philadelphia Navy Yard; &quot;Gregory&quot; sailed to Charleston, South Carolina, 4 January 1921. A year of local training operations out of the southern port ended 12 April 1922, when &quot;Gregory&quot; entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She decommissioned 7 July 1922 and went into reserve.

As war broke again over Europe, threatening to involve the United States, &quot;Gregory&quot; and three other four-stackers were taken out of mothballs for conversion to high-speed transports. The destroyers were stripped of virtually all their armament to make room for boats, while other important modifications were made for troops and cargo (such as removing two forward boiler rooms and their stacks). &quot;Gregory&quot; recommissioned 4 November 1940 as APD-3 and joined , , and to form Transport Division 12 (TransDiv 12). &quot;Gregory&quot; and her sister APDs trained along the East Coast for the following year perfecting landing techniques with various Marine divisions. None of these ships survived through the Pacific war, as all but &quot;McKean&quot; were lost during the Solomon Islands campaign.

===World War II===
On 27 January 1942 she departed Charleston for Pearl Harbor. Exercises in Hawaiian waters kept TransDiv 12 in the Pacific through the spring, after which they returned to San Diego for repairs. They sailed for the Pacific again on 7 June, reaching Pearl Harbor a week later to train for the upcoming invasion of Guadalcanal, America&#x27;s first offensive effort in the Pacific campaign.

Departing Nouméa on 31 July 1942, &quot;Gregory&quot; joined Task Force 62 (TF 62) (under Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher) and steamed for Guadalcanal. After sending her Marines ashore in the first assault waves 7 August, &quot;Gregory&quot; and her sister APDs remained in the area. The ships patrolled the waters around the hotly contested islands, waters which were to gain notoriety as &quot;Iron Bottom Sound&quot;, and brought up ammunition &amp; supplies from Espiritu Santo.

On 4 September, &quot;Gregory&quot; and &quot;Little&quot; were returning to their anchorage at Tulagi after transferring a Marine Raider Battalion to Savo Island. The night was inky-black with a low haze obscuring all landmarks, and the captains decided to remain on patrol rather than risk threading their way through the dangerous channel. As they steamed between Guadalcanal and Savo Island at , , and entered the Slot undetected to deliver a &quot;Tokyo Express&quot; package of troops and supplies to Guadalcanal. After completing the delivery, the crews prepared to bombard Henderson Field at Lunga Point. At 00:56 on 5 September, &quot;Gregory&quot; and &quot;Little&quot; saw flashes of gunfire which they assumed came from a Japanese submarine until radar showed four targets; apparently a cruiser had joined the three destroyers. While the two outgunned ships were debating whether to close for action or depart quietly and undetected, the decision was taken out of their hands.

A Navy pilot had also seen the gunfire and, assuming it came from a Japanese submarine, dropped a string of five flares almost on top of the two APDs. &quot;Gregory&quot; and &quot;Little&quot;, silhouetted against the blackness, were spotted immediately by the Japanese destroyers, which opened fire at 01:00. &quot;Gregory&quot; brought all her guns to bear but was overmatched and less than 3 minutes after the flares had been dropped was dead in the water and beginning to sink. Two boilers had burst and her decks were a mass of flames. Her skipper, Lieutenant Commander Harry F. Bauer, himself seriously wounded, gave the word to abandon ship, and &quot;Gregory&quot;″s crew took to the water. Bauer ordered two companions to aid another crewman yelling for help and was never seen again; for his conduct, he posthumously received the Silver Star. The U.S. Navy subsequently named a ship, , in recognition of his gallant action.

At 01:23, with all of &quot;Gregory&quot;″s and most of &quot;Little&quot;″s crew in the water, the Japanese ships began shelling again—aiming not at the crippled ships but at their helpless crews in the water. &quot;Gregory&quot; sank stern first some 40 minutes after the firing had begun, and was followed two hours later by &quot;Little&quot;. Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, in praising the courageous crews after their loss, wrote that &quot;both of these small vessels fought as well as possible against the overwhelming odds ... With little means, they performed duties vital to the success of the campaign.&quot; 24 officers and men, including the commanding officer, from &quot;Gregory&quot; were killed.

Petty Officer First Class Charles French swam 6–8 hours in shark-infested waters near Guadalcanal while towing a life raft with 15 of the &quot;Gregory&quot;″s survivors to avoid capture and possible execution by Japanese forces on land.

&quot;Gregory&quot;″s name was struck from the Navy List 2 October 1942.

==Awards==
&quot;Gregory&quot; received two battle stars for her World War II service.

<doc id="512029" wikidata="Q1281741" url="?curid=512029" title="Otis Blackwell">
<text>Otis Blackwell (February 16, 1931 – May 6, 2002) was an American songwriter whose work influenced rock and roll. His compositions include &quot;Fever&quot; (recorded by Little Willie John), &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot; and &quot;Breathless&quot; (recorded by Jerry Lee Lewis), &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, &quot;All Shook Up&quot;, and &quot;Return to Sender&quot; (with Winfield Scott; recorded by Elvis Presley), and &quot;Handy Man&quot; (recorded by Jimmy Jones).

== Biography ==
Blackwell was born in Brooklyn, New York. He learned to play the piano as a child and grew up listening to both R&amp;B and country music.

His first success was winning a local talent contest (&quot;Amateur Night&quot;) at the Apollo Theater in Harlem in 1952. This led to a recording contract with RCA and then with Jay-Dee. His first release was his own composition &quot;Daddy Rolling Stone&quot;, which became a favorite in Jamaica, where it was recorded by Derek Martin. The song later became part of The Who&#x27;s mod repertoire. Enjoying some early recording and performing success, he found his first love was songwriting and by 1955 had settled into the groove that he would ride for decades. His first successes as a songwriter came in 1956, when Little Willie John&#x27;s R&amp;B hit with the sultry &quot;Fever&quot; was an even bigger pop success for Peggy Lee, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; began a highly profitable association with Elvis Presley.

Blackwell was one of the leading figures of early rock and roll, although he was not well known by the public. His own records never cracked the Top 40, yet he wrote million-selling songs for Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Dee Clark and others. He also recruited other songwriters to write for Presley, such as Winfield Scott.

In the liner notes of &quot;Elvis&#x27; Golden Records&quot; (1958), Anne Fulchino of RCA Records, wrote,

While sipping coffee, Steve Sholes pulled out a demonstration record of &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; and told Elvis it was a new song written by Otis Blackwell, whom Elvis had long admired as a rhythm and blues artist. It took just a few bars to convince Presley that it was a perfect song for him, and he decided to cut it right away. Presley learned the song within minutes—he had an inherent musical sense—and in short order a great master was put on tape.

It is not often that the title of a song will create a whole new expression in Americana. &quot;All Shook Up&quot; did exactly that. Youngsters and adults alike have made the phrase a common part of everyday usage. The background to the song itself is a rather interesting one. Since the huge success of &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, Elvis had been anxious to record another song from the pen of Otis Blackwell. Eventually, Blackwell came around with &quot;All Shook Up&quot; (first recorded by David Hill on Aladdin). Presley was not completely satisfied with the song, and with Blackwell&#x27;s consent re-wrote part of the lyrics. Thus, as co-writer as well as artist, Presley produced his ninth consecutive gold record, his first in the year 1957.

During an appearance on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, Blackwell said he never met Presley in person. When he was having a contract dispute with his publishing company, he also wrote under the white-sounding pen name John Davenport. Blackwell composed more than a thousand songs, garnering worldwide sales of close to 200 million records. Presley&#x27;s manager, Colonel Tom Parker, asked Blackwell to appear in the Presley movie &quot;Girls! Girls! Girls!&quot;, for which he had written &quot;Return to Sender&quot;, but a superstition about meeting Presley kept him from accepting.

In 1956, Blackwell gave &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; to friend Frankie Valli&#x27;s group, &quot;The Four Lovers&quot;, but as they were recording it he asked to take it back and in turn gave it to the up-and-coming Presley. In exchange for this song, he gave them &quot;You&#x27;re the Apple of My Eye&quot;, which became a chart hit for the Four Lovers (Billboard number 64).

As the tide of Rock and roll receded, Blackwell recorded R&amp;B songs for numerous labels, including Atlantic, MGM and Epic. In later years, he was in semi-retirement, making only occasional live appearances.

In the 1980s, Blackwell toured and recorded with the Smithereens as his backing band for both live shows and studio recordings. The partnership produced two self-funded albums, &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Us&quot; and &quot;From the Beginning&quot;, which were released independently on Blackwell&#x27;s ROC-CO imprint.

In 1991, Blackwell was paralyzed by a stroke. Three years later, Shanachie released the album &quot;Brace Yourself! A Tribute to Otis Blackwell&quot;, containing 15 songs written by Blackwell and recorded by the likes of Kris Kristofferson (&quot;All Shook Up&quot;), Blondie&#x27;s Debbie Harry (&quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;), the Smithereens (&quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Us&quot;), Graham Parker (&quot;Paralyzed&quot;), and Ronnie Spector (&quot;Brace Yourself&quot;).

Blackwell died of a heart attack in 2002 in Nashville, Tennessee, and was interred in Woodlawn Memorial Park.

== Awards and recognition ==
Otis Blackwell was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1986 and in 1991 into the National Academy of Popular Music&#x27;s Songwriters Hall of Fame. Blackwell&#x27;s crowning moment came in the late 1980s when the Black Rock Coalition, a prominent organization of black rock musicians, led by Vernon Reid, the lead guitarist of the band, Living Colour, held a tribute for him at the Prospect Park Bandshell in his native Brooklyn. Many prominent musicians and singers took part including Blackwell himself, who performed an assortment of his best songs, including &quot;One Broken Heart for Sale&quot;, &quot;Back Trail&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; and &quot;Daddy Rolling Stone&quot;.

Blackwell was named one of the 2010 recipients of Ahmet Ertegun Award in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. This category encompasses those who primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry.

In 2022, Blackwell was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.

== Legacy ==
Blackwell is considered one of the greatest R&amp;B songwriters of all time. His songwriting style is as uniquely identifiable as that of Leiber and Stoller, Chuck Berry, or Willie Dixon and helped redefine popular music in America in the 1950s. This is true even though he often collaborated with such partners as Winfield Scott, Eddie Cooley, and Jack Hammer. Blackwell was one of the most important innovators who helped invent the musical vocabulary of rock and roll at its very beginning. His works have been recorded by a host of major artists, including Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Ray Charles, Otis Redding, James Brown, The Who, Johnny Thunders, Billy Joel, James Taylor, Dolly Parton, Conway Twitty, the Judds, Carl Perkins, Lonnie Lee, and Peggy Lee, among numerous others. At other times in his career, Blackwell was also successful as a record producer, having helped turn out hits for artists as diverse as Connie Francis, Mahalia Jackson, and Sal Mineo.

<text>Canadian Forces Base Borden (also CFB Borden, French: Base des Forces canadiennes Borden or BFC Borden), formerly RCAF Station Camp Borden, is a large Canadian Forces base located in Ontario. The historic birthplace of the Royal Canadian Air Force, CFB Borden is home to the largest training wing in the Canadian Armed Forces. The base is run by Canadian Forces Support Training Group (CFSTG) and reports to the Canadian Defence Academy (CDA) in Kingston.

==History==

At the height of the First World War, the Borden Military Camp opened at a location on a glacial moraine west of Barrie in 1916 to train units for the Canadian Expeditionary Force. It was named for Sir Frederick William Borden, former Minister of Militia. In May 1916, the Barrie and Collingwood companies of the 157th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF (perpetuated today by The Grey and Simcoe Foresters), under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel D.H. MacLaren, began construction of the camp. Camp Borden was selected in 1917 for a military aerodrome, becoming the first flying station of the Royal Flying Corps Canada. 

During the inter-war period, the aerodrome was used for veteran pilot refresher training by the Canadian Air Force (CAF), a part-time, non-permanent air militia. This militia training scheme began in July 1920 and ended in March 1922. Although this training had ended, the CAF continued, reorganized, and eventually evolved into the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Pilot training resumed in May 1923. The air force also conducted specialist courses. Other schools included an Army Co-operation School, an Air Armament &amp; Bombing School and a Technical Training School. When the air force became “royal” in 1924, the station was renamed RCAF Station Camp Borden.
Camp Borden&#x27;s training grounds were expanded in 1938 to house the Canadian Tank School. The Siskins were a RCAF aerobatic flying team that was established in 1929 at Camp Borden. 

During the Second World War, both Camp Borden and RCAF Station Camp Borden became the most important training facility in Canada, housing both army training and flight training, the latter under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP). The BCATP&#x27;s No. 1 Service Flying Training School (SFTS) was located here until 1946. Relief landing fields were located at Alliston and Edenvale. A third landing field, known locally as Leach&#x27;s Field, was operated by Camp Borden from the 1920s to the 1950s. The L-shaped airstrip was rudimentary; the &quot;runways&quot; at Leach&#x27;s Field utilized the existing ground surface. It was primarily used for touch-and-go flying.

During the Cold War, Borden&#x27;s importance as an RCAF facility in Ontario declined in favour of CFB Trenton, CFB Uplands and CFB North Bay. However, its use as an army facility stayed consistent until 1970 when a major reorganization of the combat arms&#x27; schools resulted in the transfer of the Infantry School and Armoured School to CFB Gagetown in New Brunswick. On the other hand, numerous &quot;purple&quot; (i.e. tri-service) schools were established or expanded from existing service training establishments, including the Canadian Forces School of Administration and Logistics, the School of Aerospace Ordnance Engineering and the Canadian Forces Health Service Training Centre. The February 1, 1968 unification of the RCAF with the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Army resulted in the creation of the Canadian Forces. The military facilities consisting of Camp Borden and RCAF Camp Station Borden were grouped under a new name, Canadian Forces Base Borden (CFB Borden). The aerodrome was closed in 1970 and the base saw use as a regular and reserve training facility for Canadian Forces Land Force Command (the army), as well as hosting various land-based training courses for Canadian Forces Air Command (the air force). 

In a 1990s reorganization of the Canadian Forces following the end of the Cold War, CFB Borden&#x27;s air force training facilities were grouped under the name 16 Wing Borden. The eight surviving Royal Flying Corps hangars at the base have been designated a National Historic Site of Canada.

==Plaque==
The Ontario Heritage Foundation, Ministry of Culture and Recreation erected a plaque in 1976. 
==Activities and facilities==
Although originally an air force training base, CFB Borden is now a training base for several elements of the Canadian Forces:
* 2 Canadian Air Division&#x27;s (2 Cdn Air Div) primary lodger unit, 16 Wing, commonly referred to as 16 Wing Borden, consists of 16 Wing Headquarters and three schools: the Canadian Forces School of Aerospace Technology and Engineering (CFSATE), the Royal Canadian Air Force Academy (RCAF Academy), and the Canadian Forces School of Aerospace Control (CFSACO), located in Cornwall, Ontario.
* The Canadian Army&#x27;s (CA) Regular Force and Primary Reserve army units use a number of training schools and large portions of the base&#x27;s training area for manoeuvres. In addition to these specific environmental element commands, CFB Borden houses a variety of other purple trades training facilities and headquarters within the Canadian Forces, including a fire-fighting school, Military Police (MP) school, a chaplaincy school, the Canadian Forces Recruiting Group, medical, dental and language schools, and supports local cadet and reserve units. The Toronto Police Service&#x27;s Emergency Task Force also trains there occasionally. CFB Borden hosts the Blackdown Cadet Training Centre, a facility established for training army cadets. This facility has also hosted air cadets and sea cadets since 2003, when the Borden Air Cadet Summer Training Centre was closed. CFB Borden&#x27;s residential area houses one regulation-sized golf course (Circled Pine Golf Course, par 72). Circled Pine Golf Course opened in 1952. The course is open to the public and serving Military. The base previously housed a 9-hole links style course, Anderson Park, which originally opened in 1917 but closed after the 2015 season. Base Borden has multiple facilities available to Canadian Armed Forces members that include the Terra theatre, Circled Pine Bowling Centre, two gyms (Buell Fitness &amp; Aquatic Centre and the sub gym, aka &#x27;the bubble&#x27;), multiple soccer fields, baseball diamonds, Andy Anderson arena and biking trails. The Base Borden Military Museum (combining four separate museums) has numerous items, equipment and vehicles from all eras of Canadian military history, including a large number of armoured vehicles and aircraft displayed outside in Worthington Park and around the headquarters area of the base. In December 2017, a military parade of the RCAF took place in honour of the anniversary of the Battle of Britain. In August 2010, the Canadian department of Defence announced a C$209 million series of projects to construct new facilities, and upgrade existing facilities, at CFB Borden.
* A voluntary Canadian military band is maintained at the base. A band at Borden was first formed in the late 1930s, before becoming the No. 6 Bomber Group Band under the leadership of Clifford Hunt. It was stationed in the United Kingdom from 1942-1946. The modern band is organized only during the summer and consists of reservists from all three services who serve at the Canadian Forces Logistics Training Centre.

In approximately 1942, the aerodrome was listed at with a variation of 8 degrees west and elevation of . Three runways were listed as follows:

At some point after the Second World War, runway 11/29 was abandoned and the other two runways were shortened. Just prior to 2004, the runways were listed as follows:

In 2004, the decision was made to close the remaining runways to all aircraft other than helicopters. Only the taxiway and a small section of runway 05/23 remain today (the rest is covered with grass). A helicopter pad is still active at the base of the former runway.

<doc id="512032" wikidata="Q1676970" url="?curid=512032" title="Virgin River">
<text>The Virgin River is a tributary of the Colorado River in the U.S. states of Utah, Nevada, and Arizona. The river is about long. It was designated Utah&#x27;s first wild and scenic river in 2009, during the centennial celebration of Zion National Park.

==History==
The first known Euro-American party to encounter the Virgin was led by Jedediah Smith in 1826. Smith named it &quot;Adams River&quot;, after then-president John Quincy Adams. Later explorer and mapmaker John C. Fremont reported that it was called &quot;Rio Virgen&quot; but did not state the origin of the name. Hiram Chittenden speculated that Smith had later renamed the river after Thomas Virgin, who was badly wounded in an 1827 attack by Mohave people during the crossing of the Mojave Desert. Virgin recovered from his wounds but was later killed, along with most of Smith&#x27;s companions, in an attack by Umpqua people (in present-day Oregon).

The Old Spanish Trail followed the Virgin River for part of its length from near St. George to the point it ascended the Mormon Plateau to cross to the Muddy River in present-day Nevada.

==Course==

Its origin is in Southwestern Utah, at the Navajo Reservoir in the Dixie National Forest, north of Zion National Park, and is formed by the confluence of the East Fork Virgin, that flows through Mount Carmel Junction on the east side of Zion National Park and Parunaweap Canyon, with the North Fork Virgin River, that flows from Navajo Lake through Zion Canyon in Zion National Park. The river flows in a southwesterly direction, passing south of the old townsite of St. George where the Fort Pearce Wash and the Santa Clara River both join the Virgin at a place the Paiutes called Tonaquint. The river then flows across the northwestern corner of Arizona through the Virgin River Gorge and past the towns of Beaver Dam and Littlefield. It enters southern Nevada near the town of Mesquite and empties into the Colorado at the Lake Mead reservoir, approximately east of Las Vegas. The last of the Virgin River forms the north arm of Lake Mead.

==Ecology==

Despite flowing through an arid region, the Virgin River is home to a surprisingly diverse array of plants and animals. Southwestern Utah is located at the intersection of three physiographic regions: the Colorado Plateau, the Great Basin, and the Mojave Desert. The exceptional landscapes and habitats of this region harbor unique plant and animal communities and species found nowhere else in the world. Without the water of the Virgin River system, these species could not exist. The Virgin River directly supports hundreds of wildlife species, including woundfin, Virgin River chub, Virgin spinedace, flannelmouth sucker, desert sucker, speckled dace, and Southwestern Willow Flycatcher. Many of these species are endangered or are considered sensitive species within the State of Utah. The Virgin River Program was established to balance increasing human demand and maintain this unique system.

Woundfin (&quot;Plagopterus argentissimus&quot;) Federally listed endangered species Size: &lt;br&gt;
One of the rarest species on earth, the endangered woundfin is found only in a small section of the Virgin River. Woundfin have large fins and scale-less, streamlined bodies that help them survive in swift, silty conditions. Although small, it is shark-like in both appearance and action as it feeds on small insects in shallow areas along the river. Woundfin live only one to two years, and their survival depends upon sufficient flow within the river, especially during hot summer months.

Virgin River chub (&quot;Gila seminuda&quot;) Federally listed endangered species Size: &lt;br&gt;
Rare and beautiful, this fish is the top native predator in the Virgin River. Chub is a fast, streamlined fish with a sloped forehead, humped back, and thin, rounded tail. The Virgin River chub feeds on small fish, insects, and plant matter. Chub prefer deep pools and runs with boulders and debris for cover. Virgin River chub were once an important food source for Native Americans and early pioneers. Listed as an endangered species, the Virgin River chub is found from Pah Tempe Hot Springs down to Halfway Wash, Nevada.

Desert sucker (&quot;Catostomus clarkii&quot;) State of Utah wildlife species of concern Size: &lt;br&gt;
The desert sucker gets its name from the way it feeds on aquatic vegetation and insects. It uses its thick cartilaginous lips to scrape and suck food from rocks and boulders along the bottom of the river. Desert Suckers are very colorful during the spring spawning season, developing bright orange and black &#x27;racing stripes&#x27; along their sides. Desert suckers are considered a sensitive species in Utah, where they are only found in the Virgin River and its tributaries.

Speckled dace (&quot;Rhinichthys osculus&quot;) Size: &lt;br&gt;
One of the most widespread species in western North America, the speckled dace is found in large numbers throughout the Virgin River and its tributaries. Speckled dace prefer rocky areas but are comfortable living in all habitats and stream sizes. Speckled dace exhibit a kaleidoscope of shapes and colors across their range. Males display bright red &quot;lipstick&quot; and red fins to attract mates during the breeding season.

Southwestern Willow Flycatcher (&quot;Empidonax traillii extimus&quot;) Federally listed endangered species&lt;br&gt;
The Willow in the Southwest In thick riparian environments around streams, rivers, and other wetlands, flycatchers can be found. The flycatcher breeds in dense, patchy environments made up of medium-sized to towering trees and shrubs at low elevations. It grows in dense populations of riparian bushes that range in height from low to moderate at higher elevations. In particular, the density of vegetation inside is significant. It is nearly usually the case that standing or slowly moving water is present in preferred environments. The destruction of riparian habitats has caused a severe decline in the populations of the southwestern willow flycatcher. Currently, this sub-species exists only in fragmented and scattered locations throughout its range. Historically, the breeding range reached from southern California, southern Nevada, southern Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, western Texas, southwestern Colorado, and northwestern Mexico. The flycatcher is a migratory bird that winters in Mexico, Central America, and northern South America. Currently, the breeding range for the flycatcher is similar to the historic range, though much of the riparian habitat in the southwest has been degraded by agricultural practices, invasion of non-native vegetation and urban development. The Southwestern Willow Flycatcher is an insectivore, taking insects from the air, or picking them from the foliage. The Southwestern Willow Flycatcher is present on breeding grounds by mid-May. By late May, nests are built, usually in a branched tree fork near the water. Typically, three eggs are laid and then incubated for 12–13 days.

Virgin spinedace (&quot;Lepidomeda mollispinis mollispinis&quot;) State conservation species Size: &lt;br&gt;
The Virgin spinedace looks, feeds, and behaves like a miniature trout. This silvery minnow gets its name from the sharp spiny rays in its dorsal fin. Virgin spinedace are found only in the Virgin River Basin. Unlike the woundfin and chub, which live only in the Virgin River, spinedace are also found throughout many tributary streams. Virgin Spinedace prefer deep pools and runs and are at home in both clear and turbid water.

Flannelmouth sucker (&quot;Catostomus latipinnis&quot;) State conservation species Size: &lt;br&gt;
The flannelmouth sucker is the largest native fish in the Virgin River, growing over two feet in length and weighing over six pounds. The flannelmouth&#x27;s thick fleshy lips contain taste buds that help it find food along the bottom of the River, including aquatic invertebrates, organic debris and algae. Flannelmouth suckers are usually found in deep sandy areas of the Virgin River, but large numbers congregate in shallow gravel areas for spawning in the spring.
Water in the river&#x27;s lower valley provides irrigation for the cultivation of cotton, pomegranates, and figs.

The Nevada river valley&#x27;s significance is commemorated by Nevada Historical Marker 56.

==Virgin River Gorge==
The scenic Virgin River Gorge is in northwest Arizona just south of the Utah state line. It is a popular winter rock climbing area noted for its steep and overhanging limestone walls. Interstate 15 follows the Virgin River for several miles through the Virgin River Gorge.

<doc id="512034" wikidata="Q282059" url="?curid=512034" title="Bananal Island">
<text>Bananal Island (, ) is a large river island formed from the bisection of the Araguaia River, in southwestern Tocantins, Brazil. The island is formed by a fork in a very flat section of the Araguaia; the western stream of the fork retains the name Araguaia and the eastern one is called the Javaés River. By reuniting later, both streams form Bananal Island, which is the second largest river island in the world and the largest without an ocean coastline, at long and wide. Its total area is . The Jaburu do Bananal is the largest of several rivers flowing within the island, parallel to the Araguaia.

==Environmental and cultural protection==
Bananal Island is a nature and culture preserve. In accordance with Article 28 of the Statute of Indian Law (Artigo 28 do Estatuto do Indío-lei) No. 6001 laid out on 19 December 1973, an area of is preserved as Araguaia National Park and further as cultural preserve for Brazilian Indigenous. The northern third of the island, which is designated as a national park, is a popular destination for ecotourism. The southern two-thirds are indigenous territories.

==Inhabitants==
Although Brazilians of non-native descent lived on the island in the past, today the entire population is indigenous.

At least four tribes live on Bananal Island: the Javaés, Karajá, Ava-Canoeiro, and Tuxá. There are sixteen &quot;aldeias&quot; or villages on the island: Barra do Rio, Barreira Branca, Boa Esperança, Boto Velho, Cachoeirinha, Fontoura, JK, Kanoanã, Kaxiwe, Macaúba, Santa Isabel, São João, Txoude, Txuiri, Wari-Wari, Watau.

There are no bridges to the island from the states of Tocantins to the east nor from Mato Grosso to the west. For the greater majority of the year, the only transport to the island is by boat. However, for a few weeks during the dry season (June – August) the river is low enough that it can be forded and the island can be reached by car. The villages have roads wide enough for cars and tractors, but most travellers walk or ride horses or bicycles.

==Municipalities==
From north to south, the island forms the western portions of the municipalities of Pium, Lagoa da Confusão, and Formoso do Araguaia, in southwestern Tocantins.

<doc id="512036" wikidata="Q1204617" url="?curid=512036" title="Ai Iijima">
<text>was a Japanese media personality, writer, activist and actress who was an AV idol early in her career, starring in more than 100 films. She later became the hostess on the nighttime television program, &quot;Gilgamesh Night,&quot; and transitioned away from AV work. After ending her career in adult videos, Iijima released a musical single in July 1993 and soon became a regular on daytime TV talk shows. Iijima became involved in campaigns to educate the public about HIV/AIDS, a cause that few Japanese celebrities were willing to undertake.

On December 24, 2008 at about 3:30 p.m. (JST), Iijima was found dead in her 21st floor Tokyo apartment. Pathology examination showed she had died of pneumonia shortly after retiring from the public eye.

== Life and career ==
Born as in Tokyo, Japan, Iijima described a troubled early life in her autobiography. She was raped in her early teens and had an abortion. She ran away from home as a teenager, later stating, &quot;I hated my parents, to the point where I would rather be coached by bums to sleep in parks wrapped in newspaper blankets.&quot; In order to make a living during this time, Iijima worked in karaoke establishments, snack bars, Ginza hostess clubs, and in &quot;enjo kōsai&quot; (paid dating).

=== Early career ===
Iijima&#x27;s adult video (AV) debut was &quot;All That Sexy Venus&quot; for the Tairiku Shobo Company&#x27;s FOXY label in April 1992. She quickly became the top AV actress of the time, appearing in over 100 films. She entered mainstream media as a hostess on the nighttime television program, &quot;Gilgamesh Night&quot;, where she became known as the &quot;T-Back Queen&quot;, for her practice of turning her rear to the camera, lifting her skirt and flashing her G-string, known in Japan as a &quot;T-Back&quot;. In addition to adult videos in the early 1990s, Iijima also acted in a number of softcore V-cinema works including the August 1992 comedy (with Hitomi Shiraishi), and the erotic suspense comedy , released in January 1993 by Japan Home Video. One of the top AV models by the age of 20, with admitted breast implants, a nose job, eyebrow work and bottom work as well, she decided to leave the porn business, intent on a career in mainstream entertainment.

After ending her career in adult videos, Iijima released a musical single in July 1993 and soon became a regular on daytime TV talk shows. Before long, she became one of the most successful &quot;tarento&quot; to make the transition from pornography into mainstream entertainment. In December 1993, she debuted in mainstream film playing an angel come down to Earth in the Toei Company fantasy . She even provided the story for her own manga series, &quot;Time Traveler Ai&quot;, in which she was featured as the main character. Publicly, Iijima became known for her outspokenness and ability to speak frankly about her past and her personal life. Privately, a friend says, &quot;At first glance, Ai appears really rough around the edges, but she&#x27;s actually really sensitive, and she always thinks of others in ways like giving them little presents. She&#x27;s that type.&quot;

Iijima also worked in video games as well. In 1995, she also voice acted for the main protagonist of the video game &quot;Magical Pop&#x27;n&quot;. In 1997, she released a video game for the Sega Saturn called &quot;Good Island Cafe&quot;. The game operates like an interactive movie, where players can make clips in black and white, and watch an interview with her. The game is entirely in Japanese.

=== &quot;Platonic Sex&quot; ===
In 2000, Iijima published &quot;Platonic Sex&quot;, a semi-autobiographical novel about a young girl who leaves home to escape her parents and ends up as an adult movie star. The book was a best-seller, selling over 1.7 million copies. By 2004, the book had been translated into Korean, Chinese, Spanish and Italian. She visited Taiwan where her book was a best-seller on a promotional tour in February 2001 and was &quot;besieged by journalists&quot; at the airport. Iijima had been popular in Taiwan since the early 1990s when her adult videos began to be imported and she remained a celebrity there for her entire career.

Her novel became the basis for a toned down three-hour television series starring Mari Hoshino which was broadcast by Fuji Television in two parts in September 2001. Another adaptation of the novel with Saki Kagami in the lead role was released as an R15 rated theatrical film by Toho in October 2001 titled &quot;Platonic Sex&quot;. This version had Iijima credited as and . Iijima&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;watashi teki ni&quot; (&quot;my way&quot;), became well known due to the popularity of the book and the movies.

It was also at this time that Iijima became involved in campaigns to educate the public about HIV/AIDS, a cause that few Japanese celebrities were willing to undertake. Iijima continued her activities for this cause in public forums and in her blog for the rest of her life.

=== Later career ===
By 2002, Iijima had become a regular on several TV shows. With her pornographic video past a decade away, Iijima was so well known as a mainstream TV celebrity that many younger members of her audience were unaware that she had once been one of the top AV actresses. Items from her early career began going for high prices, and an unauthorized 2002 box-set release of her adult videos sold very well, until her lawyers took it off the market.

Iijima&#x27;s acceptance into the mainstream gave her access to the highest levels of Japanese society, including once having dinner with Junichiro Koizumi, who was Japan&#x27;s Minister of Health and Welfare at the time. Iijima claims that on this occasion, the future Prime Minister discussed the sex life of dragonflies with her.

In November 2004, Iijima was invited to speak about her past at the Foreign Correspondents&#x27; Club of Japan. Later the same month, she participated in a United Nations program in Tokyo on AIDS awareness in the week leading up to World AIDS Day on December 1, 2004. She made cameo appearances in the 2005 horror film &quot;The Curse (Noroi)&quot; and the September 2006 police show parody.

=== Retirement ===
After the difficulties of her early life, Iijima&#x27;s career in mainstream entertainment had been remarkably free of trouble for over a decade until she was victimized by an embezzler at her talent agency, who took about 100 million yen from her. Late in 2006, she took two weeks off from her position as a panelist on the Sunday morning TV variety show, &quot;Sunday Japon&quot;. She later revealed in her blog that she was suffering from health problems, causing rumors of her possible retirement from show business to circulate in the press. In March 2007, when asked by the host of &quot;Sunday Japon&quot; whether rumors of her retirement were true, Iijima replied, &quot;Yes, I have been wanting to quit for some time. I will announce my future plans next week.&quot;

Iijima&#x27;s farewell appearance was at the end of March 2007 on the TV program KinSuma, on which she had been a regular for five years. It was described as &quot;a teary two-hour sayonara party complete with speeches, bouquets and lots of blubbering&quot;. However, when psychic Fujiko Kimura confronted Iijima on the program, telling her not to retire and suggesting that there was more behind the retirement announcement than had been made public, Iijima &quot;seemed to admit as much and was reduced to tears.&quot; Whatever the circumstances leading to the decision, Ai Iijima&#x27;s retirement at the age of 34 brought an end to what has been called &quot;one of the more remarkable careers in the cutthroat Japanese entertainment world&quot;.

=== Death ===
On December 24, 2008, at about 3:30 p.m. (JST), Iijima was found dead in her 21st floor Tokyo apartment, not far from Shibuya Crossing. She was found lying face-down on the floor when medics forced their way into her place. She had been dead for about seven days, police said. On March 3, 2007, &quot;Sports Nippon&quot; had reported that Ai Iijima was suffering from hay fever, pyelitis (ascending urinary tract infection that has reached the pyelum (pelvis) of the kidney), cystitis, and acute backache. She had written in her blog that she had kidney problems and inflammation of the urinary tract and bladder. In February 2009, police announced that the pathology examination showed she had died of pneumonia, and that there was no suggestion of either suicide or murder.

On March 1, 2009, a memorial service for Iijima was held at the Tokyo Prince Hotel with 700 friends and relatives attending. Later in the day, some 1500 people offered prayers as the service was opened to the public. All proceeds for the day went to the Japan Foundation for AIDS Prevention. Iijima was given a posthumous Special Award at the 9th Takeshi Kitano Entertainment Awards for 2009.

<text>Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Juzayy Al Gharnati (), better known as Ibn Juzayy () was an Andalusian Sunni Muslim scholar of Arab origin. He was a distinguished Maliki jurist, legal theoretician, Quran commentator, Quran reciter, hadith scholar, historian, scholar in Arabic, poet, preacher, orator, and a literary figure. He achieved notoriety at a young age, known as a major scholar of his day. He is famed for authoring classical works and for achieving martyrdom during his jihad against the Spanish Christian crusade.

==Lineage==
Ibn Juzayy Al-Kalbi ancestry is originally from Yemen. He is a member of the Yemeni tribe called Kalb al-Quda&#x27;iyya, and his tribe Banu Kalb reached Andalusia in two ways: The first category was that of governors, which led Anbasa bin Suhaim al-Kalbi to enter in 103 AH as a governor. The second category was that of the conquerors, which Abu all-Khattam Hussam bin Dirar Al-Kalbi entered in 125 AH. All these kinds belonged to a tribe called the Kalb, although Ibn Juzayy al-Kalbi&#x27;s forefathers were among the conquerors. His grandfather, Sultan Abu Bakr Abdul Rahman Ibn Juzayy, was given the position of president and exclusive management of Jaén in the year 539 AH.

==Early life==
===Birth===
He was born, on Thursday, the ninth of Rabi&#x27; al-Thani, in the year 693 AH corresponding to March 15, 1294 CE, in the city of Granada, the capital of Andalusia at that time.

===Education===
He came from an illustrious family renown for their knowledge and piety. His father Ahmad Ibn Juzayy (d. 710 AH approximately) was a scholar and a reciter. It was through his family&#x27;s influence that led him to crave for knowledge.

Ibn al-Khatib said: “He (may Allah have mercy upon him) was sincerely devoted to knowledge, studying, writing, and teaching, and he ventured into different areas of knowledge: Arabic language, Usool al-Fiqh, Quranic modes of recitation, Hadeeth, Arabic literature, and Tafseer. He memorized and comprehended the statements of the earlier scholars and studied many books and references.”

===Teachers===
His Famous Teachers are:

* Abu Jaʻfar ibn Az-Zubayr
* Abu Al-Hasan ibn Samʻoon
* Abu &#x27;Abdullaah ibn Al-ʻImaad

He also narrated from:

* Abu &#x27;Abdullaah ibn Abi ʻAamir ibn Rabi&#x27;
* Abu Al-Majd ibn Abi ʻAli ibn Abi Al-Ahwaz

==Scholarly life==
===Career===
After this stage, Ibn Juzayy devoted himself to teaching his students the Qur’an, the rules of its recitation, the readings with their narrations, and he taught them the Hadith, especially the six main Sunni Hadith collections (Kutub al-Sittah), including Muwatta Malik, the Arabic language, interpretation, legal theory and Maliki jurisprudence. He worked early on in writing and he mostly worked in issuing fatwas according to the Maliki school of thought. He was appointed as a preacher and led prayers in the Great Mosque in Granada, despite his young age; people commended his knowledge, righteousness and character.

===Students===
Many students graduated under him:

* Lisan al-Din Ibn al-Khatib (d. 776 AH),
* Muhammad bin Muhammad Al-Ansari, known as Ibn al-Khashab (d. 774 AH),
* Abu Abdullah Al-Shadid (d. after 776 AH),

And his three sons, they are:

* Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Muhammad Al-Katib (d. 757 AH),
* And Abu Bakr Ahmed bin Muhammad Al-Qadi (d. 758 AH),
* And Abu Muhammad Abdullah bin Muhamma

==Death==
On Jumada al-Awwal 9th, 741 AH corresponding to October 30, 1340 AD, Ibn Juzayy was killed in the Battle of Tarifa at the young age of 46, which took place in southern Andalusia between the Muslim army, consisting of an alliance of the Marinid Sultanate and the Emirate of Granada, and the Christian army, consisting of an alliance of the Kingdom of Castile and the Kingdom of Portugal. Ibn Juzay was participating with the Muslim army and he was the forefront in vocalizing jihad urging them to fight and stimulating their enthusiasm, but when the battle ended with the defeat of the Muslim armies, Ibn Juzayy was killed and died as martyr.

<text>USS &quot;Colhoun&quot; (DD-85/APD-2) was a in the United States Navy during World War I and later redesignated APD-2 in World War II. She was the first Navy ship named for Edmund Colhoun.

Launched in 1918, she remained on convoy duty for the final few months of World War I, and she then operated out of the Atlantic for several years until being decommissioned in 1922. Returning to service in 1940 as a high-speed troop transport, &quot;Colhoun&quot; was dispatched to support the Guadalcanal campaign early in World War II. While unloading supplies to the island on 30 August 1942, she was attacked by aircraft of the Empire of Japan, and sunk with the loss of 51 men.

== Design and construction ==
&quot;Colhoun&quot; was one of 111 s built by the United States Navy between 1917 and 1919. She, along with 25 of her sisters, were constructed at Fore River Shipyard shipyards in Quincy, Massachusetts, using specifications and detail designs drawn up by Bethlehem Steel.

She had a standard displacement of an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . On trials, &quot;Harding&quot; reached a speed of . She was armed with four /50 caliber guns and twelve torpedo tubes. She had a regular crew complement of 100 officers and enlisted men. She was driven by two Curtis steam turbines powered by four Yarrow boilers.

Specifics on &quot;Colhoun&quot;″s performance are not known, but she was one of the group of &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyers designed by Bethlehem Steel, built from a different design than the &#x27;Liberty type&#x27; destroyers constructed from detail designs drawn up by Bath Iron Works, which used Parsons or Westinghouse turbines. The non-&#x27;Liberty&#x27; type destroyers deteriorated badly in service, and in 1929 all 60 of this group were retired by the Navy. Actual performance of these ships was far below intended specifications especially in fuel economy, with most only able to make at instead of the design standard of at . The class also suffered problems with turning and weight.

&quot;Colhoun&quot; was the first commissioned in the U.S. Navy named for Edmund Colhoun. The second was a commissioned in 1944.

==Service history==

&quot;Colhoun&quot; was launched on 21 February 1918 from Fore River Shipyard and sponsored by Helen A. Colhoun, the daughter of Edmund Ross Colhoun. She was commissioned on 13 June 1918. Reporting to the United States Atlantic Fleet, she was assigned as a convoy escort between New York City and ports in Europe, escorting ships carrying troops and supplies supporting World War I from 30 June and 14 September 1918. On 18 November 1918, she reported to New London, Connecticut, to assist in tests of sound equipment which was under development at the time. On 1 January 1919, she was rushed to assist the troop transport which had run aground off Fire Island, New York. &quot;Colhoun&quot; assisted in transporting 194 of the troops off of the ship, who had been returning from Europe, to their destination port in Hoboken, New Jersey.

On 1 December 1919, she was placed in reduced commission at Philadelphia Navy Yard, and then underwent an overhaul at Norfolk Navy Yard. Between 1919 and 1922, &quot;Colhoun&quot; remained assigned to the Atlantic Fleet on reserve status, based out of Charleston, South Carolina. She took part in sporadic fleet exercises and large maneuvers, as well as taking several midshipman cruises through the Caribbean and along the east coast. In mid-1922, she returned to Philadelphia Naval Yard and was decommissioned on 28 June.

&quot;Colhoun&quot; was towed to Norfolk Navy Yard on 5 June 1940, and began conversion to a high-speed transport. She was recommissioned into the fleet on 11 December 1940, and received the hull classification symbol of APD-2. Following this, she underwent a year of training exercises between Norfolk and the Caribbean, where she was during the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the entry of the U.S. into World War II.

=== World War II ===

With the war underway, she sailed for the Pacific to join the U.S. Pacific Fleet. There, she joined Transport Squadron 12 based out of Pearl Harbor, and began conducting anti-submarine warfare exercises there for a time. She arrived in Nouméa, New Caledonia on 21 July 1942. With a shortage of combat ships at the beginning of the war, &quot;Colhoun&quot; served a dual role as both a high-speed transport and an anti-submarine warfare vessel. In this role, she began preparations for the invasion of the Solomon Islands. On 7 August 1942, she carried units of the 1st Marine Raider Battalion in the initial assault landings which began the Guadalcanal Campaign and continued to serve as both transport and antisubmarine vessel in support of the invasion.

On the morning of 30 August 1942, &quot;Colhoun&quot; ported at Kukum Point and unloaded stores for the U.S. Marine Corps garrison on Guadalcanal, and then exited the harbor to undertake anti-submarine patrols. Just before 12:00, an air raid siren was issued and &quot;Colhoun&quot; moved out to sea. A second alert was received at 14:00. Shortly thereafter, a lookout spotted a formation of Japanese aircraft approaching using the sun as cover. The Japanese aircraft, using clouds as cover, dove and released three bombs against &quot;Colhoun&quot;, two splashing nearby and one striking the after searchlight platform and a nearby boat. The bomb blew the after davits down and forward, blocking the after engine room hatches, and starting a fire from the diesel oil spilled by the boat.

&quot;Colhoun&quot; attempted to return fire with her anti-aircraft batteries, but the Japanese aircraft remained obscured by clouds. A second dive launched five or six bombs on her starboard side, knocking down the foremast and blowing two and one gun off the ship. A lubrication oil cooler pump in the after engine room was blown through the bulkhead into the forward engine room. Another two bombs scored direct hits on the after deck house, killing all of the men there. An order was given to abandon ship, and several tank lighters arrived quickly from Guadalcanal to assist in taking in survivors. &quot;Colhoun&quot; sank at . Fifty-one men were killed and 18 wounded in her sinking. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 September 1942. She received one battle star for her service in World War II.

<text>Matthew Chandler Fox (born July 14, 1966) is an American actor. He is known for his roles as Charlie Salinger on &quot;Party of Five&quot; (1994–2000) and Jack Shephard on the drama series &quot;Lost&quot; (2004–2010), the latter of which earned him Golden Globe Award and Primetime Emmy Award nominations. Fox has also performed in eleven feature films, including &quot;We Are Marshall&quot; (2006), &quot;Vantage Point&quot; (2008), &quot;Alex Cross&quot; (2012), &quot;Emperor&quot; (2012) and &quot;Bone Tomahawk&quot; (2015).

== Early life ==
Fox was born in Abington, Pennsylvania, the son of Loretta B. (née Eagono) and Francis G. Fox. He has two brothers, Francis, Jr. (b. 1961) and Bayard (b. 1969). One of his paternal great-great-great-grandfathers was Union General George Meade. His father was from a &quot;very blue-blood&quot; Pennsylvania family of mostly English descent, while his mother was of half Italian and half British ancestry. The second of three boys, Fox&#x27;s family moved to Wyoming when he was a year old. They settled in Crowheart, Wyoming, on the Wind River Indian Reservation. His mother was a teacher, and his father, who had been a consultant for an oil company, raised longhorn cattle and horses, and grew barley for Coors beer. Fox attended Wind River High School in Pavillion, Wyoming and transferred to Deerfield Academy during his senior year and graduated in 1985. He graduated from Columbia University with a B.A. in economics in 1989. While at Columbia, he was a wide receiver on the school&#x27;s football team.

== Career ==
At the age of 25, Fox made his debut on an episode of &quot;Wings&quot;. That same year, he also starred on a short-lived dramatic series, &quot;Freshman Dorm&quot;. Still not a familiar face on the small screen, he continued to be cast in supporting roles, including the role of Charlie in the CBS Schoolbreak Special series &quot;If I Die Before I Wake&quot;, before he made his big-screen debut in &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back&quot; (1993).

In 1994, Fox was cast in a starring role as Charlie Salinger, the eldest of five siblings who lose both parents in a car accident on the 1994–2000 teen drama &quot;Party of Five&quot;, co-starring with Scott Wolf, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Love Hewitt, and Lacey Chabert. In 1996, &quot;People Magazine&quot; named Fox one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the World. In 1999 he co-starred with Donald Sutherland in the true story-based film &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; (1999). After &quot;Party of Five&quot; was canceled following its sixth season, Fox starred in another TV series, &quot;Haunted&quot;, in 2002.

From September 2004 until May 2010, Fox played the role of the dedicated yet troubled surgeon, Dr. Jack Shephard, on &quot;Lost&quot;. He initially auditioned for the role of James &quot;Sawyer&quot; Ford. However, co-creator J. J. Abrams thought he would be better for the role of Jack, a role originally slated to be for the pilot episode only.
Fox was nominated for a Golden Globe in the category &quot;Best Actor – Television Series Drama&quot;, won the 2005 Satellite Award, and shared the 2006 Screen Actors Guild Award for &quot;Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series&quot;, for his role in &quot;Lost&quot;.

On December 2, 2006, Fox hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; with musical guests Tenacious D. In 2006, he co-starred with Matthew McConaughey in the sports drama &quot;We Are Marshall&quot;. He also played a bit part in the action film &quot;Smokin&#x27; Aces&quot; (along with Lost&#x27;s co-star Néstor Carbonell and future cast member Kevin Durand) and starred in the 2008 thriller &quot;Vantage Point&quot;. In May 2008, Fox starred as Racer X in the movie &quot;Speed Racer&quot;.

Fox has repeatedly stated that he is &quot;done with television&quot; after &quot;Lost&quot;.

In 2011, he starred in the stage play &quot;In a Forest, Dark and Deep&quot; with Olivia Williams in London&#x27;s West End.

Fox co-starred in &quot;Alex Cross&quot; (2012), as the villain, Michael &quot;The Butcher&quot; Sullivan, nicknamed &quot;Picasso&quot;. For the role, Fox developed an extremely muscular physique and shed most of his body fat. The film was a critical and commercial failure but Fox was praised for his transformation and credibility in a vastly different role from Lost&#x27;s Jack Shephard.

He appeared very briefly in the 2013 film &quot;World War Z&quot; which starred Brad Pitt.

He starred in the film &quot;Extinction&quot; that was released in July 2015. Directed by Miguel Ángel Vivas, the film is an adaptation of Juan de Dios Garduño&#x27;s bestselling novel, &quot;Y pese a todo&quot;.

That same year, Fox also co-starred in the critically acclaimed American horror Western &quot;Bone Tomahawk&quot;. He had always wanted to act in a Western.

From 2014 to 2021, Fox took a break from acting to spend time with his family. 

In 2021, Fox was cast in the lead role of a limited series &quot;Last Light&quot;, which was released on Peacock.

== Personal life ==

In 1992, Fox married his long-time girlfriend, Margherita Ronchi, a native of Italy. The couple met while Fox was a student at Columbia. The couple have two children. Fox is also a photographer. A bonus disc released with The Complete First Series of &quot;Lost&quot; features &quot;The Art of Matthew Fox&quot;, showing pictures he took of the cast and crew while on set.

Fox has a passion for flying airplanes, and owns a Bonanza G36. &quot;To be up there by yourself, and it&#x27;s all up to you whether it&#x27;s gonna be an amazing flight or it&#x27;s not gonna go as beautiful[ly]. I feel like I&#x27;m hyper-prepared when I fly. There is so much you don&#x27;t have control over.&quot;

===Legal issues and allegations of abuse===

On August 28, 2011, Fox was arrested for an alleged assault of a female bus driver in Cleveland, Ohio. Prosecutors decided not to charge Fox. In May 2012, the bus driver withdrew a civil suit after her lawyer departed and revealed that she &quot;intentionally failed and refused to provide full and timely cooperation and information&quot;. In October 2012, Fox appeared on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; and refuted the accusations. He stated that he was punched in the face by a man and retaliated and that the bus driver tried to extort him.

In May 2012, his &quot;Lost&quot; co-star Dominic Monaghan tweeted about Fox, &quot;He beats women. Not isolated incidents. Often.&quot; Fox called Monaghan&#x27;s claims &quot;a pile of bullshit&quot; and said he was not going to &quot;waste too much breath on that.&quot; He also told &quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot; in 2012 that he has &quot;never hit a woman before. Never have, never will.&quot;

That same year, Fox was arrested for driving under the influence.

<text>The African Great Lakes (; ) are a series of lakes constituting the part of the Rift Valley lakes in and around the East African Rift. The series includes Lake Victoria, the second-largest freshwater lake in the world by area; Lake Tanganyika, the world&#x27;s second-largest freshwater lake by volume and depth; Lake Malawi, the world&#x27;s eighth-largest freshwater lake by area; and Lake Turkana, the world&#x27;s largest permanent desert lake and the world&#x27;s largest alkaline lake. Collectively, they contain of water, which is more than either Lake Baikal or the North American Great Lakes. This total constitutes about 25% of the planet&#x27;s unfrozen surface fresh water. The large rift lakes of Africa are the ancient home of great biodiversity, and 10% of the world&#x27;s fish species live in this region.

Countries in the area which are bounded by the lakes of the Great Lakes region include Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Zambia, Tanzania, and Uganda.

==Lakes and drainage basins==
The following are included on most lists of the African Great Lakes, grouped by drainage basin. The exact number of lakes considered part of the African Great Lakes varies by list, and may include smaller lakes in the rift valleys, especially if they are part of the same drainage basin as the larger lakes, such as Lake Kyoga.

===Lakes that drain into the White Nile===
* Lake Victoria
* Lake Kyoga (part of the Great Lakes system but not itself a &quot;great lake&quot;)
* Lake Albert
* Lake Edward

===Lakes that drain into the Congo River===
* Lake Tanganyika
* Lake Kivu
* Lake Mweru
* Lake Bangweulu

===Lake that drains into the Zambezi===
* Lake Malawi, via the Shire River

===Lakes with closed basins===
* Lake Turkana
* Lake Rukwa

== African Great Lakes region ==
The Great Lakes region (rarely: &quot;Greater&quot; Lakes region) consists of ten riparian countries: Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.
The adjective &quot;&quot; (&quot;between lakes&quot;) can refer to the region,
or more specifically, the nations or area bounded by the lakes.

The Swahili language is the most commonly spoken language in the African Great Lakes region. It also serves as a national or official language of five nations in the region: Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Because of its high population—estimated to be 107 million people—and the agricultural surplus in the region, the area became organized into a number of small states. The most powerful of these monarchies were Buganda, Bunyoro, Karagwe, Rwanda, and Burundi.

Being the long-sought source of the Nile and the watershed triple point between the rivers Nile, Congo and Zambezi, the region had long been of interest to Europeans. The first Europeans to arrive in the region in any numbers were Christian missionaries who had limited success in converting the locals, but did open the region to later colonization. Increased contact with the rest of the world led to a series of devastating epidemics affecting both humans and livestock.

While seen as a region with great potential after independence, the Great Lakes region has suffered from civil war and conflict in the four decades around the turn of the 21st century (–2020). In 2022 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees commended Tanzania for consistently welcoming and aiding refugees from other countries in the region.

==Climate==
The highlands are relatively cool, with average temperatures ranging between and and abundant rainfall. Major drainage basins include those of the Congo-Zaire, Nile, and Zambezi rivers, which drain into the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and Indian Ocean, respectively.

Forests are dominant in the lowlands of the Congo-Zaire Basin, while grasslands and savannas (dry grasslands) are most common in the southern and eastern highlands. Temperatures in the lowlands average about . Around Lake Turkana, the climate is hot and very dry. A short rainy season in October is followed by a longer one from April to May.

==Flora and fauna==
The Western Rift Valley lakes are freshwater and home to an extraordinary number of endemic species. More than 1,500 cichlid fish species live in the lakes, as well as other fish families. The lakes are also important habitats for a number of amphibian species. Nile crocodiles are numerous. Mammals include elephants, gorillas and hippopotamus.

The Lake Turkana area is home to hundreds of species of birds endemic to Kenya. The flamingo wades in its shallows. The East African rift system also serves as a flyway for migrating birds, bringing in hundreds more. The birds are essentially supported by plankton masses in the lake, which also feed the fish there.

Vegetation ranges from rainforest to savanna grasses. In some lakes, rapidly growing invasive plants, like the surface-choking water hyacinth and shore-clogging papyrus, are problems. Water hyacinth have thus far affected only Lake Victoria.

==Geology==
Until 12 million years ago, the bountiful waters of the equatorial plateau either flowed west into the Congo River system or east to the Indian Ocean. This was changed by the formation of the Great Rift Valley. A rift is a weak place in Earth&#x27;s crust due to the separation of two tectonic plates, often accompanied by a graben, or trough, in which lake water can collect. This rift began when East Africa, impelled by currents in the mantle, began separating from the rest of Africa, moving to the northeast. The basins that resulted from the geological uplifts filled with water that now flowed north.

Lake Victoria is not actually within the Rift Valley. It occupies a depression between the Eastern and Western Rifts, formed by the uplift of the rifts to either of its sides.

==Archaeology==
Around two to three million years ago, Lake Turkana was larger and the area more fertile, making it a center for early hominids. Richard Leakey led numerous anthropological excavations in the area, which yielded many important discoveries of hominin remains. The two-million-year-old Skull 1470 was found in 1972. It was originally thought to be &quot;Homo habilis&quot;, but some anthropologists have assigned it to a new species, &quot;Homo rudolfensis&quot;, named after the lake (previously known as Lake Rudolf). In 1984, the Turkana Boy, a nearly complete skeleton of a &quot;Homo erectus&quot; boy was discovered. In 1999, a 3,500,000-year-old skull was discovered there, named &quot;Kenyanthropus platyops&quot;, which means &quot;flat-faced man of Kenya&quot;.

==Economy==
Fishing—primarily of tilapia species but also of Nile perch—provides the main livelihood for people in the region. With four Great Lakes on its borders, Uganda ranks as one of the world&#x27;s largest producers of freshwater fish. The climate and rich volcanic soils in the highlands also sustain intensely cultivated croplands.

The economies of the Great Lakes region states have different structures and are at various stages of development. The GDP real growth rate ranges from 1.8 percent in Burundi to 4.4 in the DRC. GDP per capita fluctuates between $600 in DRC and Burundi and $800 in Uganda.

<text>USS &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; (DD-130), named for Commodore Jacob Jones USN (1768–1850), was a . She was sunk by a German submarine in 1942 during World War II.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Jacob Jones&quot; was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden, New Jersey on 21 February 1918, launched on 20 November 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Cazenove Doughton, great-granddaughter of Commodore Jones, and commissioned on 20 October 1919.

==Service history==
&quot;Jacob Jones&quot; was decommissioned on 24 June 1922 and placed in reserve until recommissioned on 1 May 1930, and was assigned to Neutrality Patrol duties out of Charleston, South Carolina on 4 April 1940.

===Inter-war period===
After fitting out at Philadelphia, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; sailed 4 December for shakedown in the Atlantic Ocean. She arrived at Pensacola, Florida on 22 December to continue her training and departed on 3 January 1920 for the Pacific Ocean. Arriving at San Diego on 26 January, she operated along the California coast on anti-aircraft and firing exercises. She entered Mare Island Navy Yard 17 August for repairs and overhaul and assumed a reserve status. Returning to duty with Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet, 18 June 1921, she operated out of San Diego until decommissioning 24 June 1922.

Recommissioned 1 May 1930, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; trained in coastal waters from Alaska to Mexico as a plane guard for the Navy&#x27;s budding aircraft carriers. Following Battle Fleet maneuvers during August, she entered Mare Island in November for repairs. The destroyer sailed 4 February 1931 for Panama, where she resumed plane guard duty for . &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; transited the Panama Canal on 22 March, and sailed for maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea. She sailed for the United States on 1 May and took part in joint Army-Navy maneuvers in the Chesapeake Bay 26 to 29 May. During the remainder of the summer, she operated with Destroyer Division 7 along the New England coast before retiring to the Boston Navy Yard 2 October for overhaul.

&quot;Jacob Jones&quot; steamed from Boston on 1 December for maneuvers off Haiti. On 13 February 1932 she departed the Caribbean to begin 13 months of plane guard duty and torpedo practice along the California coast. She returned to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba on 1 May 1933 for general drill and battle problem exercises, and on 26 May she sailed for Norfolk, Virginia to undergo self-upkeep on rotating reserve.

Following two months of at Charleston, &quot;Jones&quot; returned to Guantanamo on 29 November for scouting and firing exercises. She interrupted her maneuvers on 29 June 1934, and sailed for Port-au-Prince, Haiti, where she served as an escort during President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Good Neighbor&quot; visit to Haiti. She resumed Caribbean operations in July and participated in landing force exercises at Guantanamo Bay during September. She retired from the Caribbean late in November and entered Norfolk Navy Yard 3 December 1934 for several months of upkeep.

In May 1935, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; embarked midshipmen from the Naval Academy for an Atlantic training cruise. She returned to Norfolk 7 June for three months of coastal patrols and maneuvers. She steamed to New York in September to participate in destroyer maneuvers and operated out of New York until entering Brooklyn Navy Yard in January 1936 for upkeep and inspection.

On 15 June 1936, the destroyer departed New York with reserve officers on board for training cruises in the Caribbean which continued through September. In October, she participated in joint Army-Navy coastal maneuvers; and, following her annual inspection at Norfolk, she participated in minesweeping training during February 1937. In March, she trained officers of the 5th Fleet Reserve and in June she resumed training cruises for midshipmen. She continued to operate as a practice ship for reserve officers until 15 January 1938, when she departed Norfolk for fleet landing exercises and battle maneuvers in waters off Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; returned to Norfolk on 13 March for overhaul. In June she resumed operations out of Norfolk, serving as a carrier plane guard and conducting torpedo and gunnery practice.

After attending the Presidential Regatta in September, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; prepared to sail for Europe to join Squadron 40-T in the Mediterranean Sea. Organized in September 1936 to protect and evacuate Americans from Spain during the civil war, the squadron remained in the western Mediterranean. Departing Norfolk 26 October, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; reached Gibraltar on 6 November, and arrived Villefranche on 17 November. She operated out of that French Mediterranean port on patrol until 20 March 1939. She visited Algiers from 24 to 25 March 1939 and, during the next seven months, steamed to various Atlantic European ports from Rotterdam to Lisbon. Departing Lisbon on 4 October, she sailed for the United States and anchored at Norfolk on 14 October.

Resuming her coastal operations, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; conducted plane screening patrols from Norfolk to Newport, Rhode Island and in December she escorted the submarine during its Caribbean shakedown.

===World War II===
After two months of upkeep and inspection at Norfolk, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; sailed for Charleston on 4 April 1940 to join the Neutrality Patrol. Organized in September 1939 as a response to the war in Europe, the Neutrality Patrol was ordered to track and report the movements of any warlike operations of belligerents in the waters of the Western Hemisphere. The basic purpose of the patrol &quot;was to emphasize the readiness of the United States Navy to defend the Western Hemisphere.&quot; In June, after two months of duty with the Neutrality Patrol, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; returned to training midshipmen.

In September, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; departed Norfolk for New London, Connecticut, where her crew underwent intensive ASW sound school training. Returning briefly to Norfolk on 6 December, she sailed to Key West for further anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training. She resumed her operations with the Neutrality Patrol in March 1941, patrolling the waters from Key West to Yucatán Channel. In May, she joined the ships which guarded the waters of Vichy-controlled islands, Martinique and Guadeloupe in the Lesser Antilles. &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; maintained her Caribbean operations throughout the summer.

On 30 September 1941, she departed Guantanamo with Destroyer Division 54 to prepare for escort duty in the North Atlantic. &quot;Jones&quot; received two months of upkeep and inspection at Norfolk and on 1 December 1941, departed for convoy escort training along the New England coast. Clearing Boston Harbor on 12 December, she sailed to Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, to begin her escort duty. On 16 December she escorted the submarines and through heavy seas to Boston and returned to Argentia on 24 December. &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; once again departed Argentia on 4 January 1942 escorting and . While steaming to join Convoy SC 63, bound for the British Isles, the destroyer made an underwater contact and commenced a depth charge attack. Losing contact with the submarine, she escorted her ships to the convoy and returned to Argentia on 5 January.

Sailing from Argentia on 14 January 1942, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; joined Convoy HX 169, which was headed for Iceland. The convoy encountered a violent storm; heavy seas and winds of force 9 scattered its ships&#x27; convoy. Separated from the convoy, the destroyer steamed independently for Hvalfjörður, Iceland. Though hampered by a shortage of fuel, an inoperable gyro compass, an erratic magnetic compass, and the continuous pounding of the storm, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; arrived on 19 January. Five days later, she escorted three merchant ships to Argentia. Once again heavy seas and fierce winds separated the ships, and &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; continued toward Argentia with one Norwegian merchantman. She detected and attacked another submarine on 2 February 1942, but her depth charges yielded no visible results.

Arriving at Argentia on 3 February, she departed the following day and rejoined Convoy ON 59, bound for Boston. Reaching Boston on 8 February, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; received a week of repairs. She sailed on 15 February for Norfolk and three days later steamed from Norfolk to New York.

In an effort to stem the losses to Allied merchant shipping along the Atlantic coast, Vice Admiral Adolphus Andrews, Commander of the Eastern Sea Frontier, established a roving ASW patrol. &quot;Jacob Jones&quot;, Lieutenant Commander Hugh Black in command, departed New York on 22 February for this duty. While passing the swept channel off Lightship Ambrose, &quot;Jones&quot; made a possible submarine contact and attacked immediately. For five hours, &quot;Jones&quot; ran twelve attack patterns, dropping some 57 depth charges. Oil slicks appeared during the last six attacks, but no other debris was detected. Having expended all her charges, &quot;Jones&quot; returned to New York to rearm. Subsequent investigation failed to reveal any conclusive evidence of a sunken submarine.

===Fate===
On the morning of 27 February 1942, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; departed New York harbor and steamed southward along the New Jersey coast to patrol and search the area between Barnegat Light and Five Fathom Bank. Shortly after her departure, she received orders to concentrate her patrol activity in waters off Cape May and the Delaware Capes. At 1530 she spotted the burning wreckage of tanker , torpedoed the previous day east of Barnegat Light; &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; circled the ship for two hours searching for survivors before resuming her southward course. Cruising at through calm seas, she last reported her position at 2000 and then commenced radio silence. A full moon lit the night sky and visibility was good; throughout the night the ship, completely darkened without running or navigation lights showing, kept her southward course.

At the first light of dawn 28 February 1942, the undetected fired a spread of torpedoes at the unsuspecting destroyer. The torpedoes were not detected and two or three struck the destroyer&#x27;s port side in rapid succession.

According to her survivors, the first torpedo struck just aft of the bridge and caused major damage. Apparently, it exploded the ship&#x27;s magazine; the resulting blast sheared off everything forward of the point of impact, destroying completely the bridge, the chart room, and the officers&#x27; and petty officers&#x27; quarters. As she stopped dead in the water, unable to signal a distress message, a second torpedo struck about forward of the fantail and carried away the after part of the ship above the keel plates and shafts and destroyed the after crew&#x27;s quarters. Only the midships section was left intact.

All but 25 or 30 officers and men, including Lieutenant Commander Black, were killed by the explosions. The survivors, including a badly wounded, &quot;practically incoherent&quot; signal officer, went for the lifeboats. Oily decks, fouled lines and rigging, and the clutter of the ship&#x27;s strewn twisted wreckage hampered their efforts to launch the boats. &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; remained afloat for about 45 minutes, allowing her survivors to clear the stricken ship in four or five rafts. Within an hour of the initial explosion &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; plunged bow first into the Atlantic; as her shattered stern disappeared, her depth charges exploded, killing several survivors on a nearby raft (as had happened to the previous &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; in 1917).

At 0810, an Army observation plane sighted the liferafts and reported their position to of the Inshore Patrol. By 1100, when strong winds and rising seas forced her to abandon her search, she had rescued 12 survivors, one of whom died en route to Cape May. The search for the other survivors of &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; continued by plane and ship for the next two days, but none were ever found.

<text>Richard James Overy (born 23 December 1947) is a British historian who has published on the history of World War II and Nazi Germany. In 2007, as &quot;The Times&quot; editor of &quot;Complete History of the World&quot;, he chose the 50 key dates of world history.

==Life and career==
Overy, after being educated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and becoming a research fellow at Churchill College, taught history at Cambridge from 1972 to 1979, as a fellow of Queens&#x27; College and from 1976 as a university assistant lecturer. He moved to King&#x27;s College London, where he became professor of modern history in 1994. He was appointed to a professorship at the University of Exeter in 2004.

Overy&#x27;s work on the Second World War has been praised as &quot;highly effective [in] the ruthless dispelling of myths&quot; (A. J. P. Taylor), &quot;original and important&quot; (&quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;) and &quot;at the cutting edge&quot; (&quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;).

In 2021, Overy helped to curate objects for displays in the Imperial War Museum&#x27;s Second World War galleries. Some of these objects included flight goggles and a leather helmet once used by Billy Strachan.

===Dispute with Timothy Mason===
In the late 1980s, Overy was involved in a historical dispute with Timothy Mason that mostly played out on the pages of &quot;Past &amp; Present&quot; over the reasons for the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. Mason had contended that a &quot;flight into war&quot; had been imposed on Adolf Hitler by a structural economic crisis, which confronted Hitler with the choice of making difficult economic decisions or aggression. Overy argued against Mason&#x27;s thesis by maintaining that though Germany was faced with economic problems in 1939, their extent cannot explain aggression against Poland and the outbreak of war was caused by the Nazi leadership. For Overy, the problem with Mason&#x27;s thesis was that it rested on assumptions that were not shown by records, information that was passed on to Hitler about Germany&#x27;s economic problems. 

Overy argued that there was a difference between economic pressures induced by the problems of the Four Year Plan and economic motives to seize raw materials, industry and foreign reserves of neighbouring states as a way of accelerating the Four Year Plan. Overy asserted that the repressive capacity of the German state as a way of dealing with domestic unhappiness was somewhat downplayed by Mason. Finally, Overy argued that there is considerable evidence that Germany felt that it could master the economic problems of rearmament; as one civil servant put it in January 1940, &quot;we have already mastered so many difficulties in the past, that here too, if one or other raw material became extremely scarce, ways and means will always yet be found to get out of a fix&quot;.

<doc id="512063" wikidata="Q469062" url="?curid=512063" title="Neutrality Patrol">
<text>On September 3, 1939, the British and French declarations of war on Germany initiated the Battle of the Atlantic. The United States Navy Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) established a combined air and ship patrol of the United States Atlantic coast, including the Caribbean, on 4 September, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared the United States&#x27; neutrality on 5 September, and declared the naval patrol a Neutrality Patrol. Roosevelt&#x27;s initiation of the Neutrality Patrol, which in fact also escorted British ships, as well as orders to U.S. Navy destroyers first to actively report U-boats, then &quot;shoot on sight&quot;, meant American neutrality was honored more in the breach than observance.

==Background==
Upon declaration of war, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany attempted to restrict their adversaries&#x27; ability to import raw materials and manufactured goods. The belligerent navies were deployed to intercept ships capable of carrying such imports. Ships evading enemy naval patrols in the open ocean faced a final gauntlet nearing the European Atlantic coast where belligerent warships and patrolling aircraft congregated around the United Kingdom adjacent to Germany&#x27;s oceanic trade routes. The United Kingdom and France controlled extensive overseas territories in 1939, while Germany had lost its colonial empire as war reparations in 1919. French and British empire seaports and airfields allowed Allied warships and aircraft to patrol around the world, while German warships controlled very few locations where they might safely refuel and resupply, and German military aircraft operations were effectively limited to occupied territory. The United Kingdom and France had more warships than Germany; so German warships relied upon concealment, speed, or disguise to avoid destruction. U-boats were most numerous and active in European coastal areas, while a few German cruisers, battleships, and merchant raiders intercepted Allied shipping on ocean trade routes.

During World War I, outnumbered German warships had shifted patrol areas away from the United Kingdom into the Atlantic to disperse opposing Allied naval forces. After refueling at Newport, Rhode Island on 7 October 1916, sank five Allied merchant ships the following day in international waters off the coast of the United States. Although K/L Hans Rose scrupulously followed international law, the loss of American export cargoes incensed Americans as neutral United States Navy destroyers were obliged to stand aside while observing nearby merchant ships being sunk, and taking aboard seamen from the sunken ships.

==Neutrality Zone==

On 4 September 1939, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) ordered the Atlantic Squadron to establish a combined air and ship patrol to observe and report the movements of ships of warring nations within a line extending east from Boston to 65 degrees west and thence south to the 19th parallel and seaward around the Leeward and Windward Islands. The concept of a naval Neutrality Patrol within that zone was presented to a Conference of Foreign Ministers of the American Republics convened in Panama on 25 September. After considerable debate, the conference agreed the Declaration of Panama on 2 October 1939, to extend the neutrality zone southwesterly parallel to the northeastern coast of South America approximately offshore.

The initial CNO orders of September 4 directed the patrols to report the movements of ships of warring nations in cipher. U.S. Navy ships were instructed to avoid making any report while in the vicinity of such ships to avoid performance of unneutral radio direction finding service or the impression that an unneutral service was being performed. However, on October 9, after discussion about delays in the process, President Roosevelt instructed the navy to transmit reports promptly in plain English; and the Neutrality Patrol began to do so on October 20.

The reporting of vessels by US forces gave a benefit to the British. While the Germans, operating out of European bases, could take little advantage of information on shipping in the Americas, the Royal Navy had far greater access to the Atlantic and could send vessels from the UK, Canada or its overseas possessions to intercept.

==Organization==
Battleships , , and with the aircraft carrier (with aircraft squadrons VB-4, VF-4, VS-41, and VS-42 embarked) formed a reserve force at Hampton Roads to support the following patrols:
* Patrol Zero: Destroyer division 18 of , , , and were assigned patrol station zero from Newfoundland south to the 40th parallel.
* Patrol One: Destroyers and were assigned patrol station one along a northwest-southeast line off Georges Bank.
* Patrol Two: Destroyers and , with aircraft of patrol squadron VP-54 and seaplane tender , operated from Newport, Rhode Island, between the 38th and 43rd parallels.
* Patrol Three: Destroyers , , , and patrolled between the 34th and 38th parallels with aircraft of VP-52 and VP-53.
* Patrol Six: Destroyers and patrolled the Florida Strait and Yucatán Channel.
* Patrols Seven and Eight: Cruisers and with destroyers , , , and patrolled the eastern Caribbean south of the 23rd parallel with aircraft of VP-33 and VP-51 supported by seaplane tenders , , and . &quot;Gannet&quot; and &quot;Thrush&quot; established a seaplane base in Puerto Rico.
* Patrol Nine: Cruisers and patrolled within of the coast between Newport and Cape Hatteras.

==New bases==
Neutrality Patrols began operating from Bermuda following the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. The base was commissioned on April 7, 1941; and Carrier Division 3 (USS &quot;Ranger&quot;, , and ) began using the base the following day. By mid-June cruisers , , and were patrolling from Trinidad south along the coast of Brazil.

==Convoy escort==
At the beginning of 1941, President Roosevelt secretly organized a protection-of-shipping task force 24, given the designation of Support Force, United States Atlantic Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Arthur L. Bristol. Ships, planes, funding, and personnel were assigned in January and February, and operations began in March. Admiral Bristol remained in Washington, but material for the various bases was assembled and shipped from Naval Air Station Quonset Point. Admiral Bristol insisted that all records be destroyed when an operation was completed. His staff believed he was following Presidential instructions to avoid revealing operations which might not have public-opinion approval. Efforts to document Support Force operations after the war were discouraged to avoid damaging world opinion as to the integrity of United States&#x27; neutrality.

To augment the fleet units already engaged in the Neutrality Patrol which President Roosevelt had placed around the eastern seaboard and Gulf ports, the United States Navy recommissioned 77 destroyers and light minelayers which had lain in reserve at either Philadelphia or San Diego. In Newfoundland on August 9, 1941, President Roosevelt agreed to provide American destroyers as escorts for the Canada to Iceland portion of HX convoys and westbound ON convoys. ineffectively engaged on September 4; and on September 11 President Roosevelt declared Axis ships entered the neutrality zone at their own risk, and ordered the U.S. Navy to attack any vessel threatening ships under American escort. HX 150 sailed September 16, 1941, as the first convoy with American escort. ON 18 sailed September 24 as the first westbound convoy with American escort. The was torpedoed while escorting Convoy SC 48 on October 17, 1941. The destroyer &quot;Reuben James&quot; was torpedoed and sunk on October 31, 1941, while escorting Convoy HX 156 with a loss of 100 lives.

==Results==
The Neutrality Patrol was a major focus of one of the world&#x27;s largest navies for the first third of the Second World War. The Atlantic Squadron in that period consisted of three battleships, four heavy cruisers, 29 destroyers, and one aircraft carrier; and their primary mission was confirmed by its being redesignated the Patrol Squadron on 1 November 1940. The Neutrality Patrol enhanced effectiveness of Allied patrols within the declared neutrality zone. On 12 July 1940, Assistant CNO Robert L. Ghormley was ordered to Britain to standardize shipboard communications between British and American warships.

The Royal Navy destroyer intercepted the German liner &quot;Columbus&quot; off Bermuda on December 19 after six days of radioed position reports by three relays of Neutrality Patrol destroyers shadowing the liner since it departed Veracruz. Roosevelt ordered all reports of the incident should indicate &quot;Hyperion&quot; encountered &quot;Columbus&quot; by chance. The Neutrality Patrol similarly radioed position reports of the British RFA tanker &quot;Patella&quot; a few days later, reasonably confident there were no German ships in position to intercept. The German freighter &quot;Konsul Horn&quot; left Aruba on January 7, 1940, posing as a Soviet ship to avoid identification by the Neutrality Patrol. The German freighter &quot;Helgoland&quot; sailed from Colombia on October 24, 1940, and evaded pursuit attempts by Neutrality Patrol destroyers. The German freighter &quot;Rio Grande&quot; similarly evaded the Neutrality Patrol by sailing from Rio de Janeiro on October 31; but prevented German ships &quot;Orinoco&quot; and &quot;Phrygia&quot; from leaving Tampico, Mexico on November 15.

For each incident of the neutrality patrol reporting a British ship in the Gulf of Mexico, several German ships were intercepted by Royal Navy units responding to the American reports. Of the 211 German merchant ships attempting return to Germany during the last four months of 1939, only 32 (37%) of the 85 ships leaving the western hemisphere through the declared neutrality zone were successful, while 100 (80%) of the 126 leaving other parts of the world successfully evaded Allied interception.
