<text>Hillah ( &quot;al-Ḥillah&quot;), also spelled Hilla, is a city in central Iraq. On the Hilla branch of the Euphrates River, it is south of Baghdad. The population was estimated to be about 455,700 in 2018. It is the capital of Babylon Province and is situated in a predominantly agricultural region which is extensively irrigated with water provided by the Hilla canal, producing a wide range of crops, fruit and textiles. Its name may be derived from the word &quot;beauty&quot; in Arabic. The river runs in the middle of the town, and it is surrounded by date palm trees and other forms of arid vegetation, reducing the harmful effects of dust and desert wind.

The city is located adjacent to the ancient city of Babylon, and close to the ancient cities of Borsippa and Kish. It was once a major centre of Islamic scholarship and education. The tomb of the Abrahamic prophet Ezekiel is reputed to be located in a nearby village, Al Kifl. It became a major administrative centre during the rule of the Ottoman and British Empires. In the 19th century, the Hilla branch of the Euphrates started to silt up and much agricultural land was lost to drought, but this process was reversed by the construction of the Hindiya Barrage in 1911–1913, which diverted water from the deeper Hindiya branch of the Euphrates into the Hilla canal. It saw heavy fighting in 1920 during an uprising against the British, when 300 men of the Manchester Regiment were defeated in the city.

==History==

===Early history===

Hillah is located near the ruins of ancient Babylon. It is likely that Babylon was founded in the third millennium BC and rose to prominence over the next thousand years. By the 18th century BC the city was the centre of the empire of Hammurabi. Various empires controlled Babylon over the following centuries. Babylon briefly regained independence during the Neo-Babylonian empire towards the end of the 7th century BC, most notably under the reign of king Nebuchadnezzar II, but came under Persian occupation in the 6th century BC.

The name &quot;Babylon&quot; translates to &quot;Gate of the God.&quot; Following the fall of the Sumerians, Babylon emerged as the center of the Babylonian Empire, established by King Hammurabi around 2100 BCE. The empire spanned from the Arabian Gulf in the south to the Tigris River in the north. Hammurabi&#x27;s rule lasted 43 years, during which the Babylonian civilization flourished, marking his reign as a golden age. Among Babylon&#x27;s wonders were the Hanging Gardens, considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, constructed by the Chaldean king Nebuchadnezzar II. 

The city featured eight gates, with the grandest being the massive Ishtar Gate, and housed the Temple of Marduk within its walls, located in the great religious festival area outside the city. Ancient sources refer to Babylon by various names, including &quot;Babylonia,&quot; meaning the land of Babylon, as well as &quot;Mesopotamia&quot; and &quot;the land of the two rivers.&quot;

The ruins of Babylon have suffered greatly due to looting and destructive policies. Parts of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s palace and some of the old city walls still remain. Saddam Hussein commissioned a restoration of ancient Babylon on part of the site. A modern palace was restored on Nebuchadnezzar ancient palace. A reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate is displayed in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.

=== Origin and foundation of Hillah ===
In the 10th century, the town of Al Jami&#x27;ayn was founded on the eastern bank of the Euphrates. The location of that town is in modern-day Hillah now. In 1101 AD a new town was founded near Al Jami&#x27;ayn. Bricks were taken from Babylon to build houses and so Hillah expanded. During the 18th century, the town became an administrative centre in the Ottoman Empire. In the 19th century, the flow in the al-Hillah stream decreased, and that led to worsening conditions for agriculture, which affected them greatly. To solve the problem, al-Hindiya Barrage was built.

According to some researchers, based on eyewitness accounts, the area where Hillah was established was not devoid of military and civilian construction for habitation. Instead, it was previously home to a city known as Al-Jamain. An eyewitness, who passed away about a century and a half before the founding of Hillah by Sadqa, described it as a small platform surrounded by a very fertile settlement. This description aligns with information from Ibn Hawqal, who lived in the 4th century AH (10th century CE), noting that the land of Al-Jamain stretched along both banks of the Hillah River. This area included the site of the ancient city of Nile, which was settled by the Banu Mazid tribe around 405 AH (1014 CE).

At that time, the land where the city of Nile was located was a large, populated village along the river, which had been excavated by Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf. In contrast, Al-Jamain was a thriving city during the 4th century AH, with notable leaders such as Ali ibn Dawood al-Tanukhi serving as judges. Throughout its history, Al-Jamain faced invasions, including attacks by the Qaramita in the 4th century AH and repeated raids by the Khafaja tribes in the early part of the 5th century AH. Historical texts confirm that Al-Jamain had a significant urban, economic, and social presence long before the establishment of Hillah.

Hillah was founded by Sayf al-Dawla Sadqa ibn Mansur in 495 AH (1101 CE) on the western bank of the Hillah River, having relocated from the city of Nile, which had been the residence of the Banu Mazid family since 405 AH (1014 CE). However, prior to Sadqa&#x27;s establishment of Hillah, the site had already been home to the city of Al-Jamain.

From the historical texts and information presented, it can be inferred that the site of Hillah on the right bank of the Hillah River witnessed the emergence of two adjacent cities, each differing in their founding dates and founders. One was Al-Jamain, whose founder remains unknown but is believed to have been established in the first half of the 1st century AH. The other was the city founded by Prince Sayf al-Dawla Sadqa in 495 AH, known as Hillah al-Sayfiyah, which became a significant center in its own right, encompassing a vast area of what is now Iraq, dominated politically and militarily by foreign elements at the time.

=== Caliphate and Ottoman rule ===
Following the fall of the Abbasid Caliphate and the Mongol invasion of Baghdad, the Mongols prepared to conquer other regions of Iraq. However, Hillah managed to avoid the devastation inflicted by the Mongols due to the wisdom of its scholars. They understood the catastrophic consequences that the Mongol forces would bring upon any city they entered, including destruction, pillaging, and violations of local laws.

In response, the prominent scholars of Hillah convened, including Sheikh Yusuf ibn Ali ibn Muthahir al-Hilli (father of the renowned scholar Al-Hilli), Sayyid Majd al-Din ibn Tawus, and Ibn Abi al-Ghar al-Hilli. They agreed to send a letter to Hulagu Khan, expressing their willingness to submit to his authority. This strategic decision preserved their city and the two holy shrines. Subsequently, Sayyid Majd al-Din Muhammad ibn Tawus authored a book titled &quot;Al-Bashara&quot;, which he presented to Hulagu. This action led Hulagu to restore local governance in the Euphrates region to Sayyid ibn Tawus and to ensure the safety of the two revered shrines and Hillah itself. As a result, Hillah continued to serve as a center of cultural and religious vitality, safeguarding treasures of Islamic knowledge and literary heritage without the upheaval experienced by other cities in Iraq. After Baghdad fell, the Jalairid state chose Hillah as its capital around 812 AH (1410 CE) during the reign of the Qarakarunlu dynasty.

During the Ottoman period, Hillah became a district (qaimmaqam) within the Diwaniya province, eventually being elevated to a mutasarrifate. Under the governance of the Ottoman official Yusuf Bey, the city underwent significant development, including the construction of public facilities, such as the Great Hillah Mosque, built in 1125 AH (1713 CE) in the Al-Jabran neighborhood, a notable historical landmark.

One of the most significant events in Hillah during the late Ottoman period, particularly during World War I, was the “Dakka Akif” uprising. Hillah raised the banner of rebellion against the oppressive Ottoman authority, leading to two assaults by the Turkish commander Akif Bey. His first campaign did not yield significant success; however, he returned with a larger force and more advanced weaponry in 1916 from his camp at Al-Kifl. During this second assault, he bombarded the city, resulting in the destruction of three neighborhoods: Al-Taq, Al-Jamain, and Al-Wardiya. The campaign led to the execution of 126 men from Hillah, while many women were captured and taken as slaves to Anatolia, forcing the remaining residents to flee.

=== Modern Iraq ===
The British occupied the city of Hillah on March 9, 1917 (15 Jumada al-Awwal, 1335 AH). Three years later, the famous 1920 Revolution erupted, in which prominent scholars and notables from Hillah played significant roles. After the 1920 Revolution, the literary sentiment evolved into a national political feeling against the British, leading to the establishment of various cultural and political associations. Hillah&#x27;s writers and intellectuals engaged in manuscript writing, as there were no opportunities for publishing or creating periodicals at that time. The events of the 1920 Revolution began on June 30, 1920, during a peak of conflict regarding governance with British occupying forces, who had abandoned their promises to the Iraqi people. Hillah was not isolated from the political climate in Iraq that preceded the uprising; the atmosphere was marked by widespread public rejection of the secretive referendum on the nature of governance held on November 30, 1918.

Hillah was among the few Iraqi cities to establish a branch of the Independence Guard Association shortly after its founding in Baghdad in late February 1919. It included prominent local figures in political activism, such as the poet Muhammad Mahdi al-Basir, who was appointed to lead the branch, along with Ra&#x27;uf al-Amin and Muhammad Baqir al-Hilli. A representative from Hillah attended a meeting in Baghdad with leaders of the movement on May 23, 1920, which served to prepare and gauge the sentiments of the Euphrates region regarding the impending revolution. The impact of these activities and the prevailing national sentiment among Hillah&#x27;s residents became clear during a large national meeting held at the Great Mosque (in Hillah&#x27;s market) just days before the revolution, on June 19, 1920, which was the second day of Eid al-Fitr. Sheikh Muhammad al-Shuhayb read a letter from religious authority Shirazi urging Iraqis to demand their legitimate rights peacefully. Following his reading, Ra&#x27;uf al-Amin and Sayyid Abdul Salam al-Hafiz addressed the crowd, delivering passionate speeches calling for Iraq&#x27;s independence and proclaiming Prince Abdullah as its king.

The British response to this public gathering was swift, resulting in the arrest of Ra&#x27;uf al-Amin, Sayyid Abdul Salam al-Hafiz, Sayyid Ahmad al-Salim al-Tawut, Baqir al-Ali al-Khafaji, Jabbar Ali al-Hassani, Ali al-Hammadi, and Khairi al-Hindawi. They were transported by train to Basra and subsequently exiled to Hengam Island in the Arabian Gulf, where they remained for five months; during this time, Sayyid Ahmad al-Salim al-Tawut passed away. In her memoirs, Miss Bell noted that the exiling of these individuals helped ease tensions in Hillah. It is noteworthy that prior to the outbreak of the 1920 Revolution, the British made Hillah a military center, reinforcing it with additional troops. Following a series of victories by the revolutionaries, most British forces stationed in the Euphrates region withdrew to Hillah, which became the last British stronghold in central Euphrates by August 1920.

Sheikh Abdul Karim al-Mashita and several family members were arrested amid the events of the revolution, facing accusations of inciting rebellion and firing at a British aircraft. They were detained until the intervention of Hajj Abdul Razzaq al-Sharif, a local dignitary and mayor of Hillah, secured their release. It was said that they faced the death penalty were it not for this intervention. Following the revolutionaries&#x27; victory at the Battle of Raranjah on July 24, which exemplified bravery and sacrifice, they launched an assault on Hillah at the end of July. However, this effort was ultimately unsuccessful due to various factors, including British superiority in numbers, equipment, and fortifications, as well as the reluctance of some tribal leaders to support the revolutionaries. One of the revolution&#x27;s leaders, Sayyid Muhammad Ali Kamal al-Din, expressed regret in his memoirs about the failure to achieve their goals, lamenting that the revolution&#x27;s direction had shifted, and the Euphrates was almost entirely under the control of British forces, as they sought to quash the uprising and dominate the rural areas of Hillah and central Euphrates. The last communiqué issued by the British High Commissioner in Iraq on November 26, 1920, announced the end of hostilities with the Shami tribes.

Following the conclusion of the Gulf War in 1991 and the withdrawal of the Iraqi army, the Popular Uprising erupted in the southern regions of Iraq, reaching the city of Hillah. The uprising began on March 3, when the insurgent forces managed to seize control of Hillah and expel members of the Ba&#x27;ath Party from the city. However, this control was short-lived, as the Republican Guard, supported by army units, launched a significant counter-offensive against Hillah. Utilizing air strikes and tank assaults, they ultimately regained full control of the city and quashed the rebellion.

===2003 US invasion===
Hillah was the scene of relatively heavy fighting in the 2003 invasion of Iraq on and around April 1, 2003. Iraqi casualties from the Medina Division of the Republican Guard were unknown but casualties reached in the several hundreds for the United States Army&#x27;s 2-70th Armor. Following the invasion, 1st Battalion 4th Marines had its headquarters at the abandoned Tariq Pistol Factory for 6 months in 2003.

In April 2003, following the fall of Baghdad to U.S. Forces, the Headquarters for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force (1st MEF) commanded by Lieutenant General James T. Conway, USMC established its command center on the adjacent grounds to Saddam Hussein’s palace in Babylon. From here General Conway coordinated all Marine Corps operations in southern Iraq. The 1st MEF was colocated adjacent to the ancient site of Babylon that included the ruins of Nebuchadnezzar’s palaces, the museum staff, the foundation for the Tower of Babylon, Marduk’s temple and a coliseum constructed by Alexander the Great.

In the first week of their encampment General Conway dispatched the Deputy MEF Chaplain, CDR Emilio Marrero, to establish contact with the staff at the Babylonian ruins site. The staff conveyed a need for assistance and requested protection against looters. General Conway approved a plan, derived by his Chief of Staff Colonel John C. Coleman, to incorporate the ancient site into the encampments perimeter in order to protect the ancient site and to support the local curators and archaeological staff. This included making Chaplain Marrero the official point of contact for all matters thus earning him the moniker, “Mayor of Babylon” amongst the staff. 

Chaplain Marrero authored a personal memoir of his experiences in Babylon, “A Quiet Reality: A Chaplains Journey with the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force in Iraq.” His book was later used for an opinion piece by Melli Kaylan in the Wall Street Journal to counter charges that the Marines contributed to the destruction of ancient Babylon (https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704013004574519354014954972) NMCB 15 was assigned duties by 1st MEF to secure and repair some of the buildings until private contracts were initiated to begin renovating the damage done by looters.

Shortly after the invasion a mass grave site was reported by locals to be in the area around Hillah. Local citizens and members of ORHA, and NMCB-15 (Naval Mobile Construction Battalion) worked together to exhume thousands of Iraqis who had been killed by Iraq&#x27;s security forces during the uprising against the government in 1991. The 1st Marine Division had established a base at one of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s palaces about one mile north of Hillah. The 372nd Military Police Company had performed law and order and Iraqi Police training in the city from June 2003 to October 2003 prior to moving on to Abu Ghraib prison. The city was part of the Polish military zone after the US Marines left in August 2003 and turned control over to the Iraq MultiNational Force during the occupation of Iraq

After the initial invasion, Hilla was relatively peaceful, but it then became the scene of numerous bomb attacks. In February, 2004, insurgents tried but failed to blow up a camp run by Hungarian troops with truck bombs. February 28, 2005 saw the deadliest single insurgent attack up till then, when a car bomb killed 125 people outside a medical clinic. On May 30, 2005, two suicide bombers killed 31, and wounded 108, Shia police. On September 30, 2005, a car bomb exploded in a vegetable market in Hilla, killing 10 and wounding 30 others. On January 2, 2007, at least 73 people were killed and more than 160 were injured when two suicide bombers blew up themselves at a gathering of Shia militias. On February 1, 2007, a pair of suicide bombers detonated explosives among shoppers at a crowded outdoor market, killing at least 45 people and wounding approximately 150. On March 6, 2007, 114 people were killed and at least 147 people were wounded in two car bomb attacks targeting Shia pilgrims. On May 10, 2010, a series of three to four suicide car bombs at the &#x27;State Company for Textile Industries&#x27; in the city killed a total of 45 people and left 140 wounded. On March 6, 2016, a truck bomb hit a military checkpoint in Hillah, killing at least 60 people and wounding more than 70. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the bombing.

It was located in the top floor of the Grand Mosque and the first director of it was Mr. Abdul Mahdi al-Hilali. Later the school moved to a building on the Shatt al-Hilla with four classes, but this school was not stable because the majority of students leave these schools to study at the seminary. The first secondary school in Hillah, established in 1927, was Al-Hillah Secondary School. Another school was Moderiat Alm&#x27;arif, founded in year 1931.

==Archaeological sites==

===Babylon ruins===

Located just 5 km (3.1 mi) north of the city of Hillah, Babylon was a marveled city of the ancient world, especially under the rule of king Nebuchadnezzar (605–562 BC). It was the capital of the Neo-Babylonian Empire and its walls and hanging gardens were considered one of the seven wonders of the world.

===Kish ruins (Tell Uhaimir)===
Kish is located 13 km (8 mi) from city of Hillah and 6 km (3.7 mi) east of the ancient city of Babylon. The large site comprises several dozen ruin mounds, the largest being Tell Uhaimir (ancient Kish) and Tell Ingharra (ancient Hursagkalama). Both mounds feature the remains of a ziggurat, or temple tower, and associated temple complexes. The god Zababa was worshipped in Kish itself, and the goddess Inana or Ishtar in Hursagkalama. The site was first occupied in at least the fourth millennium BC, and the latest archaeological remains found there date to the late Abbasid period.

===Alberes===
Alberes is situated south of Hillah, approximately 24 km (14.9 mi) away. It has a tower found between Hillah and Al-Khifil. Its current name is a distortion of the name Old Babylonian &quot;بورسيا&quot; (which is now a newspaper) and its Sumerian meaning is &quot;sword of the sea&quot;, because it was located on the Ghadeer edge along the banks of the Sea of Najaf.

<text>IXI Limited was a British software company that developed and marketed windowing products for Unix, supporting all the popular Unix platforms of the time. Founded in 1987, it was based in Cambridge. The product it was most known for was X.desktop, a desktop environment graphical user interface built on the X Window System. IXI was acquired by the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) in February 1993.

==Origins in the Cambridge hi-tech cluster==
In the beginning of the 1970s, the so-called Cambridge hi-tech cluster became the site of a network of new firms in the rapidly growing computer field, many of which featured founders and employees who had studied at the University of Cambridge.
And in particular, as an article in the journal &quot;Regional Studies&quot; has noted, IXI was one of many companies started by founders or employees or those in the nexus of Cambridge-based Acorn Computers, the most noted of which is ARM Holdings.

IXI founder Ray Anderson was a graduate of the university who had become director of research and development at Torch Computers, a computer systems firm located in the Cambridge area that was most known for making peripherals for the BBC Micro made by Acorn. Torch built workstations among its products, and also had a license agreement to provide NeXT with aspects of workstation technology.

In the end, Torch was not successful, but its work inspired Anderson to carry the idea on.

==Independent company==
IXI Limited was founded by Ray Anderson in 1987 as a private company. Anderson originally had a former colleague as a partner, but the partner decided a start-up was too uncertain and pulled out within a year or so. Anderson found funding for IXI from sources in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, and Japan, but avoiding US investors as his prior experiences had made him leery of them.

As one former SCO UK employee has succinctly summarised, &quot;IXI specialised in software that ran on Unix and made Unix easier to use.&quot; In particular, a goal was to make Unix workstations as easy to use as a Macintosh, which would allow non-technical people to use such platforms.
IXI&#x27;s best-known product was X.desktop, an X11-based graphical desktop environment with finder and file management capabilities for Unix systems. There was an opportunity for such a product because when the X11 version of the X Window System came out in 1987, it made a point of separation of mechanism and policy (indeed, it has been termed a canonical example of that design philosophy). Consequently, while it supported the ability to provide such things, it contained no specification for application user-interface design such as buttons, menus, or window title-bar styles, nor did it provide a standard window manager, file manager, or desktop.

The initial unreleased version of X.desktop, intended as a proof of concept, was programmed to the Xlib level; the first version that saw public release, 1.3, was based on the Xt library and Athena widgets. The X.desktop product then came to be based on Motif toolkit from the Open Software Foundation (OSF), a switch that happened in 1989 with release 2.0.

The first customers for IXI came in the financial industry, who were early adopters of Unix-based workstations. These were generally American companies, with sales to the Japanese market coming soon thereafter.
Indeed, IXI has been characterized as an example of a &quot;global start-up&quot;, in that instead of following the expected route for a start-up of establishing a domestic business first and then slowly expanding into international operations, it worked to establish an international business right away.

A crucial part of IXI&#x27;s standard was to capitalize on standards and thus defeat competitors who were based more upon proprietary solutions. This later paid benefits when X.desktop proved cost-effective to internationalize to other languages.

X.desktop was sold as both shrink-wrapped software for end users, at a price of $495 for any platform. But it was also sold on an OEM basis to system manufacturers. Early OEM customers included Locus Computing Corporation, BiiN, Olivetti, Acorn Computers and Compaq. An OEM sale was to IBM in 1989 for its RS/6000 and IBM AIX proved to be a turning point in IXI&#x27;s fortunes. The SCO OpenDesktop product was another early adopter, and was another key usage of the product for the company. OEM customers gained by 1990 included NCR Corporation, Dell, Uniplex, Parallel Systems International, and Network Computing Devices.

As an &quot;InfoWorld&quot; article from 1990 stated, the ability to have OEM customers was a key factor in IXI Limited being successful. Part of this success was due to X.desktop coming with a customization toolkit that allowed system manufacturers to modify the appearance and functionality of the desktop environment to match their needs. The customization took the form not just of customizing icons, but the ability to tie icons to arbitrary series of commands.

The X.desktop product was stated as being ported to, and sold on, over a dozen different Unix variants. And as a paper published for a 1994 USENIX conference detailed, versions of X.desktop were actually built for over 30 different Unix platforms. The ability to maintain the portability of the X.desktop code base became a key factor in IXI&#x27;s success with the product.

The primary competitor of X.desktop was the Looking Glass product from the American company Visix Software, Inc. Trade publications ran comparisons of the two desktop environments, and detailed cases where one beat another for an account.

Eventually over a million instances of X.desktop were in use. In 1992 IXI released Deskworks, a suite of productivity tools that included such things as a clock, a text editor, a mail client, a time management tool, and the like.

For 1992, IXI Ltd had revenues of about $6 million. By early 1993, the firm employed around 50 people, and in addition to its Cambridge headquarters, it also had offices in San Ramon, California, in the US and in Tokyo in Japan. According to a later article in &quot;MoneyWeek&quot;, by this time IXI had some 70% of the workstation market.

==Acquisition by SCO==

IXI was acquired by the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), in an announcement made on 25 February 1993. Terms of the purchase were not publicly disclosed, but did involve an exchange of stock. As mentioned, SCO had previously licensed IXI technology in its operating system product, and there were existing ties between the engineering and marketing functions of both companies. Anderson later said of his motivation to sell, that having gotten a 70% share, &quot;getting the remaining 30% of the market would have required heavy reinvestment. I felt ready to move on.&quot;

The IXI brand continued on for the next couple of years as a relatively independent subsidiary of SCO. The announcement in mid-1993 by several major Unix vendors of the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) project posed a competitive threat to X.desktop, but it took two years of further development until CDE actually came out.

Several new products were introduced during this time. IXI Panorama, introduced about a month after the acquisition, was a Motif-based window manager, that could run with or without X.desktop; it had the ability to plot and manage a virtual space much greater than the physical space of the monitor itself. Panorama was extended in March 1994 with IXI Mosaic, reflecting the incorporation of the first popular web browser, Mosaic, into the SCO Global Access product, a modified version of SCO Open Desktop that served as an Internet gateway. In doing this, SCO and IXI put out the world&#x27;s first commercial web browser based on Mosaic, and, according to Anderson, the first commercial web browser of any kind.

IXI Premier Motif was a product that came from IXI taking the OSF-released Motif source code and applying a set of bug fixes and enhancements and then porting it such that it would give identical behavior across platforms. IXI also offered some twenty different Motif training courses for users. The IXI Wintif product, which became available in 1994, built further upon Premier Motif to create a version of Motif that had the look-and-feel of Microsoft Windows 3.1 and thus would enable Windows users to operate Unix applications without confusion or need for additional training. A later version extended this capability to Windows 95.

Then in 1995, the IXI business unit of SCO was merged with another SCO acquisition, the Leeds-based Visionware, to form IXI Visionware. (IXI had previously collaborated with Visionware, going back to 1988 when the Visionware technologies were first being developed within Systime Computers Ltd.) Later in 1995 the merged business unit was subsumed more fully into its parent and became the Client Integration Division of SCO, which put out products from both former companies under the &quot;Vision&quot;-branded family name. This included the creation of VisionFS, an SMB server that could do network installs of the Windows components of the Vision family from a Unix server with minimal user configuration needed. This division then developed and released the Tarantella terminal services application in 1997 and that became the core of Tarantella, Inc. in 2001. Tarantella, Inc. struggled and following company-wide layoffs, the Cambridge development site closed in the summer of 2003.

==Fates==
The X.desktop code gradually went into maintenance mode as X.desktop OEM providers migrated to CDE and many end-users abandoned Unix-based workstations altogether and switched to Wintel platforms. Ray Anderson left SCO after several years there, and in 1999 founded Bango plc, a mobile commerce company based in Cambridge.

<doc id="530537" wikidata="Q572111" url="?curid=530537" title="Anterograde amnesia">
<text>In neurology, anterograde amnesia is the inability to create new memories after an event that caused amnesia, leading to a partial or complete inability to recall the recent past, while long-term memories from before the event remain intact. This is in contrast to retrograde amnesia, where memories created prior to the event are lost while new memories can still be created. Both can occur together in the same patient. To a large degree, anterograde amnesia remains a mysterious ailment because the precise mechanism of storing memories is not yet well understood, although it is known that the regions of the brain involved are certain sites in the temporal cortex, especially in the hippocampus and nearby subcortical regions.

==Signs and symptoms==
People with anterograde amnesic syndromes may present widely varying degrees of forgetfulness. Some with severe cases have a combined form of anterograde and retrograde amnesia, sometimes called global amnesia.

In the case of drug-induced amnesia, it may be short-lived and patients can recover from it. In another case, which has been studied extensively since the early 1970s, patients often have permanent damage, although some recovery is possible, depending on the nature of the pathophysiology. Usually, some capacity for learning remains, although it may be very elementary. In cases of pure anterograde amnesia, patients have recollections of events prior to the injury, but cannot recall day-to-day information or new facts presented to them after the injury occurred.

In most cases of anterograde amnesia, patients lose declarative memory, or the recollection of facts, but they retain nondeclarative memory, often called procedural memory. For instance, they are able to remember, and in some cases learn how to do things, such as talking on the phone or riding a bicycle, but they may not remember what they had eaten earlier that day for lunch. One extensively studied anterograde amnesiac patient, codenamed H.M., demonstrated that despite his amnesia preventing him from learning new declarative information, procedural memory consolidation was still possible, albeit severely reduced in power. He, along with other patients with anterograde amnesia, were given the same maze to complete day after day.

Despite having no memory of having completed the maze the day before, unconscious practice of completing the same maze over and over reduced the amount of time needed to complete it in subsequent trials. From these results, Corkin et al. concluded despite having no declarative memory (i.e. no conscious memory of completing the maze exists), the patients still had a working procedural memory (learning done unconsciously through practice). This supports the notion that declarative and procedural memory are consolidated in different areas of the brain. Patients have a diminished ability to remember the temporal context in which objects were presented. Certain authors claim the deficit in temporal context memory is more significant than the deficit in the semantic learning ability (described below).

==Causes==
This disorder is usually acquired in one of four ways: One cause is benzodiazepine drugs such as midazolam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, temazepam, nitrazepam, triazolam, clonazepam, alprazolam, diazepam, and nimetazepam. All of these are known to have powerful amnesic effects. This has also been recorded in non-benzodiazepine sedatives or &quot;z-drugs&quot; which act on the same set of receptors, such as zolpidem (also known as Ambien), eszopiclone (also known as Lunesta), and zopiclone (also known by brand names Imovane and Zimovane). A second cause is a traumatic brain injury in which damage is usually done to the hippocampus or surrounding cortices. It may also be caused by PTSD, a shocking event, or an emotional disorder.
Illness, though much rarer, can also cause anterograde amnesia if it causes encephalitis, which is the inflammation of brain tissue. There are several types of encephalitis: one such is herpes simplex encephalitis (HSV), which, if left untreated, can lead to neurological deterioration. How HSV gains access to the brain is unknown. The virus shows a distinct predilection for certain parts of the brain. Initially, it is present in the limbic cortices. It may then spread to the adjacent frontal and temporal lobes. Damage to specific areas can result in reduced or eliminated ability to encode new explicit memories, giving rise to anterograde amnesia. 

Patients with anterograde amnesia may have episodic, semantic, or both types of explicit memory impaired for events after the trauma that caused the amnesia. This suggests that memory consolidation for different types of memory takes place in different regions of the brain. Despite this, current knowledge on human memory is still insufficient to &quot;map out&quot; the wiring of a human brain to discover which parts of which lobe are responsible for the various episodic and semantic knowledge within a person&#x27;s memory.

Amnesia is seen in patients who, for the reason of preventing another more serious disorder, have parts of their brains known to be involved in memory circuits removed, the most notable of which is known as the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system, described below. Patients with seizures originating in the MTL may have either side or both structures removed (there is one structure per hemisphere). Patients with tumors who undergo surgery will often sustain damage to these structures, as is described in a case below. Damage to any part of this system, including the hippocampus and surrounding cortices, results in amnesic syndromes. This is why after a stroke people have a chance of developing cognitive deficits that result in anterograde amnesia, since strokes can involve the temporal lobe in the temporal cortex, and the temporal cortex houses the hippocampus.

Anterograde amnesia can be the first clinical sign that Alzheimer&#x27;s disease is developing within the brain. Although later the complications can be much more widespread and strongly impair cognitive processes, at the initial stage of Alzheimer&#x27;s the changes observed can be restricted to anterograde amnesia and a mild deficit in retaining newly learnt sequences. This is explained by the fact that the disease is initiated within the medial temporal lobe and first affects the entorhinal cortex that directly sends and receives information from the hippocampal formation.

===Alcohol intoxication===
Anterograde amnesia can also be caused by alcohol intoxication, a phenomenon commonly known as a blackout. Studies show rapid rises in blood alcohol concentration over a short period of time severely impair or in some cases completely block the brain&#x27;s ability to transfer short-term memories created during the period of intoxication to long-term memory for storage and later retrieval. Such rapid rises are caused by drinking large amounts of alcohol in short periods of time, especially on an empty stomach, as the dilution of alcohol by food slows the absorption of alcohol. Alcohol-related anterograde amnesia is directly related to the rate of consumption of alcohol, and is often associated with binge drinking, and not just the total amount of alcohol consumed in a drinking episode.

Test subjects have been found not to experience amnesia when drinking slowly, despite being heavily intoxicated by the end of the experiment. When alcohol is consumed at a rapid rate, the point at which most healthy people&#x27;s long-term memory creation starts to fail usually occurs at approximately 0.20% BAC, but can be reached as low as 0.14% BAC for infrequent drinkers. The exact duration of these blackout periods is hard to determine, because most people fall asleep before they black out. Upon reaching sobriety, usually after waking, long-term memory creation is completely restored.

Chronic alcoholism often leads to a thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency in the brain, causing Korsakoff&#x27;s syndrome, a neurological disorder which is generally preceded by an acute neurological condition known as Wernicke&#x27;s encephalopathy (WE). 
The memory impairment that is pathognomonic to Korsakoff&#x27;s syndrome predominantly affects the declarative memory, leaving non-declarative memory that is often procedural in nature relatively intact. The disproportionate severity in anterograde episodic memory processes in contrast to other cognitive processes is what differentiates Korsakoff syndrome from other conditions such as alcohol-related dementia. Evidence for the preservation of certain memory processes in the presence of severe anterograde episodic memory serve as an experimental paradigm to investigate the components of human memory.

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology of anterograde amnesic syndromes varies with the extent of damage and the regions of the brain that were damaged. The most well-described regions indicated in this disorder are the medial temporal lobe (MTL), basal forebrain, and fornix. Beyond the details described below, the precise process of how we remember – on a micro scale – remains a mystery. Neuropsychologists and scientists are still not in total agreement over whether forgetting is due to faulty encoding, accelerated forgetting, or faulty retrieval, although a great deal of data seem to point to the encoding hypothesis. 

Neuroscientists are in disagreement about the length of time involved in memory consolidation. Though most researchers, including Hasselmo et al., have found the consolidation process is spread out over several hours before transitioning from a fragile to a more permanent state, others, including Brown et al., posits that memory consolidation can take months or even years in a drawn-out process of consolidation and reinforcement. Further research into the length of time of memory consolidation will shed more light on why anterograde amnesia sometimes affects some memories gained after the event(s) that caused the amnesia, but does not affect other such memories.

===Medial temporal lobe===

The MTL memory system includes the hippocampal formation (CA fields, dentate gyrus, subicular complex), perirhinal, entorhinal, and parahippocampal cortices. It is known to be important for the storage and processing of declarative memory, which allows for factual recall. It is also known to communicate with the neocortex in the establishment and maintenance of long-term memories, although its known functions are independent of long-term memory. Nondeclarative memory, on the other hand, which allows for the performance of different skills and habits, is not part of the MTL memory system. Most data point to a &quot;division of labor&quot; among the parts of this system, although this is still being debated and is described in detail below.

In animal models, researchers have shown monkeys with damage to both the hippocampus and its adjacent cortical regions were more severely impaired in terms of anterograde amnesia than monkeys with damage localized to hippocampal structures. However, conflicting data in another primate study points to the observation that the amount of tissue damaged does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the memory loss. The data does not explain the dichotomy that exists in the MTL memory system between episodic memory and semantic memory (described below).

An important finding in amnesic patients with MTL damage is the impairment of memory in all sensory modalities – sound, touch, smell, taste, and sight. This reflects the fact that the MTL is a processor for all of the sensory modalities, and helps store these kind of thoughts into memory. In addition, subjects can often remember how to perform relatively simple tasks immediately, in the order of 10 seconds. When the task becomes more difficult, even on the same time scale, subjects tend to forget. This demonstrates the difficulty of separating procedural memory tasks from declarative memory; some elements of declarative memory may be used in learning procedural tasks.

MTL amnesic patients with localized damage to the hippocampus retain other perceptual abilities, such as the ability to intelligently function in society, to make conversation, to make one&#x27;s bed, etc. Anterograde amnesics without combined retrograde disorders (localized damage to the MTL system) have memories prior to the traumatic event. For this reason, the MTL is not the storage place of all memories; other regions in the brain also store memories. The key is the MTL is responsible for the learning of new materials.

===Other memory systems===
A limited number of cases have been described in which patients with damage to other parts of the brain acquired anterograde amnesia. Easton and Parker observed damage to either the hippocampus or the surrounding cortices does not seem to result in severe amnesia in primate models. They suggested damage to the hippocampus and surrounding structures alone does not explain the amnesia they saw in patients, or increasing damage does not correlate with the degree of impairment. 

The data does not explain the dichotomy that exists in the MTL memory system between episodic and semantic memory. To demonstrate their hypothesis, they used a primate model with damage to the basal forebrain. They proposed that the disruption of neurons that project from the basal forebrain to the MTL are responsible for some of the impairment in anterograde amnesia. Easton and Parker also reported MRI scans of patients with severe anterograde amnesia showed damage beyond to cortical areas around the hippocampus and amygdala (a region of brain involved in emotions) and to surrounding white matter. White matter in the brain consists of axons, long projections of neuronal cell bodies.

Another case described the onset of anterograde amnesia as a result of cell death in the fornix, another structure that carries information from the hippocampus to the structures of the limbic system and the diencephalon. The patient in this case did not show any disconnection syndrome, which is unexpected since the structures involved divide the brain hemispheres. Both sides of her brain were able to communicate. Instead, she showed signs of amnesia. The final diagnosis was made by MRI. This particular amnesic syndrome is difficult to diagnose and is often misdiagnosed by physicians as an acute psychiatric disorder.

==Reorganization of memory==
When there is damage to just one side of the MTL, there is opportunity for normal functioning or near-normal function for memories. Neuroplasticity describes the ability of the cortex to remap when necessary. Remapping can occur in cases like the one above and with time the patient can recover and become more skilled at memory retention. A case report describing a patient who had two lobectomies – in the first, doctors removed part of her right MTL first because of seizures originating from the region, and later her left because she developed a tumor – demonstrates this.

This case is unique because it is the only one in which both sides of the MTL were removed at different times. The authors observed that the patient was able to recover some ability to learn when she had only one MTL, but observed the deterioration of function when both sides of the MTL were affected. The reorganization of brain function for epileptic patients has had limited investigation, but imaging results show that it may occur.

==Rehabilitation==
Approaches used to treat those with anterograde amnesia often use interventions which focus on compensatory techniques, such as beepers, written notes, diaries or through intensive training programs involving the active participation of the individual concerned, along with their supporting network of family and friends. In this perspective, environmental adaptation techniques are used, such as the compensatory technique education to training (exercise), organizational strategies, visual imagery and verbal labeling. Other techniques are used in rehabilitation, such as implicit tasks, speech and mnemotechnic methods.

So far, it has been proven that education techniques of compensatory strategies for memory disorders are effective in individuals with minor traumatic brain injuries. In moderately or severely injured individuals, effective interventions are those appealing to external aids, such as reminders in order to facilitate particular knowledge or skill acquisition. In reality, orientation techniques are also considered; their purpose is to enhance orientation using stimulation and repetition of the basic orientation information. These techniques are regularly applied in populations of patients primarily presenting dementia and head injuries.

==Controversies==
===Episodic versus semantic memory===
As described above, patients with anterograde amnesia have a wide range of forgetfulness. Declarative memory can be further subdivided into episodic and semantic memory. Episodic memory is the recollection of autobiographical information with a temporal and/or spatial context, whereas semantic memory involves recall of factual information with no such association (language, history, geography, etc.). In a case study of a girl who developed anterograde amnesia during childhood, it was determined that the patient (&quot;C.L.&quot;) retained semantic memory while having an extreme impairment of episodic memory.

One patient, known by the codename &quot;Gene&quot;, was involved in a motorcycle accident that damaged significant portions of his frontal and temporal lobes, including his left hippocampus. As a result, he could not remember any specific episode in his life, such as a train derailment near his house. However, his semantic memory was intact; he remembered that he owned a car and two motorcycles, and he could even remember the names of his classmates in a school photograph. 

In stark contrast, a woman whose temporal lobes were damaged in the front due to encephalitis lost her semantic memory. She lost her memory of many simple words, historical events, and other trivial information categorized under semantic memory. Her episodic memory was left intact. She could recall episodes such as her wedding and her father&#x27;s death with great detail. 

Vicari et al. describe that it remains unclear whether neural circuits involved in semantic and episodic memory overlap partially or completely, and this case seems to suggest that the two systems are independent. Both of the patient&#x27;s hippocampal and diencephalic structures on the right and left sides were disconnected. When C.L. came to Vicari et al.&#x27;s office, her chief complaint was forgetfulness involving both semantic and episodic memory. After administering a battery of neuropsychological tests, Vicari determined that C.L. performed well in tests of visual naming and sentence comprehension, visual-spatial ability, and &quot;general semantic knowledge about the world&quot;. They also noted an improved vocabulary and general knowledge base after 18 months. 

C.L.&#x27;s episodic memory, on the other hand, was far below expectations: She could not retain daily events, where she had gone on vacation, the names of places she had been, and other such information. However, this study and others like it are susceptible to subjectivity, since it is not always possible to clearly distinguish between episodic and semantic memory. For this reason, the topic remains controversial and debated.

===Familiarity and the fractionation of memory===
The right hippocampus is clearly necessary for familiarity in spatial tasks, whereas the left hippocampus is necessary for familiarity-based recollection in verbal tasks. Some researchers claim the hippocampus is important for the retrieval of memories, whereas adjacent cortical regions can support familiarity-based memories. These memory decisions are made based on matching already-existing memories, before the onset of pathology, to the current situation. According to Gilboa et al., patients with localized hippocampal damage can score well on a test if it is based on familiarity.

Poreh et al. describe a case study of patient A.D., whose damage to the fornix rendered the hippocampus useless, but spared adjacent cortical areas – a fairly rare injury. When the patient was given a test with something with which he had some familiarity, the patient was able to score well. In general, A.D. had severely impaired episodic memory, but had some ability to learn semantic knowledge. Other studies show animals with similar injuries can recognize objects with which they are familiar, but, when the objects are presented in an unexpected context, they do not score well on recognition tests.

===Islands of memory===
Patients with anterograde amnesia have trouble recalling new information and new autobiographical events, but the data is less consistent in regard to the latter. Medveds and Hirst recorded the presence of islands of memory – detailed accounts – that were described by such patients. The island memories were a combination of semantic and episodic memories. The researchers recorded patients giving long narratives with a fair amount of detail that resembled memories that the patients had prior to the trauma. The appearance of islands of memory could have something to do with the functioning of adjacent cortical areas and the neocortex. In addition, the researchers suspect that the amygdala played a role in the narratives.

==Notable cases==
The most famous case reported is that of patient Henry Molaison, known as H.M., in March 1953. Molaison&#x27;s chief complaint was the persistence of severe seizures and therefore had a bilateral lobectomy, with both his medial temporal lobes removed. As a result, Molaison had bilateral damage to both the hippocampal formation and the perirhinal cortex. Molaison had average intelligence and perceptual ability, and a decent vocabulary. However, he could not learn new words or remember things that had happened more than a few minutes earlier. He could remember anything from his childhood. If the memory was created from before his lobectomy, he still had the ability to retrieve it and remember. However, he was able to learn some new skills. He was the first well-documented case of severe anterograde amnesia, and was studied until his death in 2008.

A similar case involved Clive Wearing, an accomplished musicologist who contracted a cold sore virus that attacked his brain, causing herpes simplex encephalitis. As a result, Wearing developed both anterograde and retrograde amnesia. He has little memory of what happened before the virus struck him in 1985, and cannot learn new declarative knowledge after the virus struck him. As a result of anterograde amnesia, Wearing repeatedly &quot;wakes up&quot; every day, usually in 30-second intervals. He has a history of repeatedly recording these moments of waking up in his journal (e.g., On Sept 2, 2013, I woke up, etc. etc.) and crossing out prior entries, as if the other moments of waking up were not real. His episodic memory is nonfunctional, so he does not consciously recall having woken up 30 seconds prior.

Clive is often elated to see his wife, as if he has not seen her for a while. Despite this, Wearing maintained his ability to play the piano and conduct choirs. This case is significant because it demonstrates declarative and procedural memory are separate. Therefore, despite anterograde amnesia preventing Wearing from learning new bits of information that can be explained in words (declarative memory), and preventing him from storing new memories of events or episodes (also part of declarative memory), he has little trouble in retaining his musical abilities (procedural memory), though he has no conscious memory of having learned music.

Another case in the literature is Eugene Pauly, known as E.P., a severely amnesic patient, owing to viral encephalitis, who was able to learn three-word sentences. He performed better on consecutive tests over a 12-week period, of 24 study sessions. However, when asked how confident he was about the answers, his confidence did not appear to increase. Bayley and Squire proposed his learning was similar to the process required by procedural memory tasks. E.P. could not get the answers right when one word in the three-word sentence was changed, or the order of words was changed. His ability to answer correctly, thus, became more of a &quot;habit&quot;. Bayley and Squire claim the learning may have happened in the neocortex, and it happened without the conscious knowledge of E.P. They hypothesized the information may be acquired directly by the neocortex (to which the hippocampus projects) when there is repetition. This case illustrates the difficulty in separating procedural from declarative tasks. This adds another dimension to the complexity of anterograde amnesia.

==In film==
Notable examples include Lucy Whitmore in &quot;50 First Dates&quot;, Joseph Gordon-Levitt in &quot;The Lookout,&quot; Kaori Fujimiya in &quot;One Week Friends&quot;, Chihiro Shindou in &quot;&quot;, Christine Lucas in &quot;Before I Go to Sleep&quot;, Gus in &quot;Remember Sunday&quot;.

Christopher Nolan&#x27;s psychological crime film &quot;Memento&quot; (2000) contains a distinguished depiction of anterograde amnesia, in that the memory-impaired protagonist Leonard Shelby is trying to identify and kill the man who raped and murdered his wife, and does so through a system of writing crucial details related to the search on his body and on the blank spaces of Polaroid photographs. Mental health experts have described &quot;Memento&quot; as one of the most accurate depictions of amnesia in film history, an accuracy that was enhanced by the film&#x27;s fragmented, non-linear structure that mimics the protagonist&#x27;s memory problems.

Dory, the happy-go-lucky Regal Blue Tang from &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003) and &quot;Finding Dory&quot; (2016), suffers from anterograde amnesia. While Dory forgets conversations within minutes of having them, she never quite forgets who she is, or the fact that she has short-term memory loss, and can therefore explain her bizarre behavior to those around her.

&quot;Ghajini&quot; (2008), a Hindi language film from India based on &quot;Memento&quot;, in which the main protagonist Sanjay Singhania played by Amir Khan has short-term memory loss, a variant of amnesia. In the film he is the one behind Ghajini, the killer of his fiancée Kalpana.
In the TV series &quot;Perception&quot;, an episode revolved around a crime victim with this condition. The main character Latro in Gene Wolfe&#x27;s novels &quot;Soldier of the Mist&quot;, and the anime characters Vash the Stampede from Trigun and Index and Tōma from &quot;A Certain Magical Index&quot; had both retrograde and anterograde amnesia. The disorder has also been portrayed in music by English musician the Caretaker in &quot;Theoretically Pure Anterograde Amnesia&quot; (2005) and Additional Amnesiac Memories (2006).

In the 1964 film &quot;36 Hours&quot;, Rod Taylor plays Nazi Major Walter Gerber, a psychiatrist who has developed an effective method for treating German soldiers with what is now known as PTSDand for painlessly extracting information from Allied prisoners. The technique involves convincing patients that years have passed, the war is over, and that they have anterograde amnesia, which supposedly can be cured with talk therapy. A few days before D-Day, U.S. Army Major Jeff Pike (James Garner) is drugged, kidnapped and taken to what appears to be a hospital run by American Occupation Forces, where his appearance is altered overnight. Pike knows that the invasion is aimed at Normandy, not Pas de Calais, as the Nazi high command expects. He buys Gerber&#x27;s explanation of anterograde amnesiausing the double doors of a wardrobe as illustrationand speaks casually of Normandy. Salt in a papercut alerts him to the horrible truth, and the drama proceeds from there.

== In television ==
In the episode &quot;Pimemento&quot; of &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;, Adrian Pimento develops an artificial form of anterograde amnesia after being drugged by his therapist, which is the main plot point of the episode.

In the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;Twilight&quot;, Jonathan Archer develops anterograde amnesia.

== In books ==
In the 2011 the light novel &quot;Danganronpa Zero&quot;, the protagonist and &quot;Ultimate Analyst&quot; Ryoko Otonashi has anterograde amnesia as a result of &quot;The Tragedy&quot;. She keeps note of her memories by writing into a journal at all times and using her speedreading to keep herself up to date. Seen to be her boyfriend and &quot;Ultimate Neurologist&quot; Yasuke Matsuda, Ryoko witnesses a murder committed by Junko Enoshima, before being mistaken for wanted murderer and Tragedy perpetrator Izuru Kamukura by the &quot;Ultimate Bodyguard&quot; Madarai octuplets. After teaming up with the perverted &quot;Ultimate Secret Agent&quot; Yuto Kamishiro in an attempt to discover the perpetrator behind the Tragedy, Ryoko learns that she herself was personally involved in the event as the true Junko. The Junko she met was her non-identical twin sister Mukuro Ikusaba, with whom she shared Matsuda as a boyfriend, attempting to trigger her memories, which Matsuda had been suppressing on Junko&#x27;s own request, both to clear her of suspicion in the events of the Tragedy, attempt to cure her depression, and a test to wipe the memories of others. Attempting to subdue Ryoko, Matsuda accidentally restores her memories of being Junko and being fatally stabbed, before wishing Junko success in her planned actions with Izuru and Mukuro: a collapsing world society and launching a &quot;killing game&quot;.

In the 2003 novel The Housekeeper and the Professor by Yōko Ogawa, the Professor suffers from anteretograde amnesia following a traffic accident and is unable to store memories for more than eighty minutes.

== In video games ==
In the 2016 video game &quot;Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Spirit of Justice&quot;, the character Sorin Sprocket is eventually revealed to have anterograde amnesia, which he developed after unintentionally causing a car accident which killed his sister. This causes his memories to completely reset every time he wakes up from sleeping, to the day after this accident. This depiction is notable for demonstrating the relationship issues that arise between Sorin and his fiancée, Ellen Wyatt, as a result of this disorder, most noticeably with how Sorin&#x27;s feelings towards her comes across as distant and cold.

As the storyline continues, the player comes to uncover that Sorin in fact deeply loves his fiancée, and is able to maintain this love despite his disorder, but in fact feels a sense of guilt over the fact that he has to constantly remind himself of the fact that this love exists inside of him every day, due to his disorder. It is also noticeable that it depicts how Sorin deals with his disorder, by keeping a journal where he writes down every detail of every day after his sister&#x27;s death. He carries this journal around everywhere he goes as a substitute to his memories, and uses what is written in the notebook to become aware each time he wakes up of the fact that he has this condition, what the current date apparently is, and everything important that have apparently occurred on every day since he first developed the condition.

The episode also deals with legal issues concerning the disorder, when it is debated during Ellen Wyatt&#x27;s trial as to whether Sorin&#x27;s journal can be considered a proper substitution to his memories for the sake of viable witness testimony. Dangers imposed by this also come into play when it is revealed that a page in Sorin&#x27;s journal had been altered by someone, which causes him to go into a mental collapse, afraid that any of his other memories and thoughts could also have arisen from someone else&#x27;s manipulation.

<text>Basiliximab, sold under the brand name Simulect, is a monoclonal antibody used to prevent rejection in kidney transplants. It is a chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody to the α chain (CD25) of the IL-2 receptor of T cells. It is used in combination with other medicines used to prevent organ rejection.

The most common side effects (seen in more than 20% of patients) include constipation, urinary tract infections (infection of the structures that carry urine), pain, nausea (feeling sick), peripheral oedema (swelling), hypertension (high blood pressure), anemia (low red blood cell counts), headache, hyperkalaemia (high blood potassium levels), hypercholesterolaemia (high blood cholesterol levels), surgical wound complication, weight increase, increased serum creatinine (a marker of kidney problems), hypophosphataemia (low blood phosphate levels), diarrhea and upper respiratory tract infection (colds).

Basiliximab was approved for medical use in the United States and in the European Union in 1998.

== Medical uses ==
Basiliximab is indicated for the prophylaxis of acute organ rejection in de-novo allogeneic renal transplantation. It is to be used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion- and corticosteroid-based immunosuppression, in people with panel reactive antibodies less than 80%, or in a triple maintenance immunosuppressive regimen containing ciclosporin for microemulsion, corticosteroids and either azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil.

Basiliximab is an immunosuppressant agent used to prevent immediate transplant rejection in people who are receiving kidney transplants, in combination with other agents. It has been reported that some cases of lichen planus have been successfully treated with basiliximab as an alternative therapy to cyclosporin. No short-term side effects have been reported.

==Mechanism of action==
Basiliximab competes with IL-2 to bind to the alpha chain subunit of the IL2 receptor on the surface of the activated T lymphocytes and thus prevents the receptor from signaling. This prevents T cells from replicating and also from activating B cells, which are responsible for the production of antibodies, which would bind to the transplanted organ and stimulate an immune response against the transplant.

==Chemistry==
It is a chimeric CD25 monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 isotype.

==History==
It is a Novartis product and was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998.

<doc id="530541" wikidata="Q412920" url="?curid=530541" title="Daclizumab">
<text>Daclizumab (trade name Zinbryta) is a therapeutic humanized monoclonal antibody which was used for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Daclizumab works by binding to CD25, the alpha subunit of the IL-2 receptor of T-cells.

In March 2018, it was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by Biogen and Abbvie after reports of autoimmune encephalitis in Europe.

==Medical uses==
Daclizumab was used to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. It is administered subcutaneously.

In clinical trials, decreases of 45% in annualized relapse rate have been reported, as well as a 41% reduction in the proportion of patients who relapsed, and a 54% reduction in the number of new lesions. A 2013 Cochrane systematic review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of daclizumab relative to placebo in people with relapsing-remitting MS and, prior to its being discontinued, the need to investigate longer lengths of treatment and follow-up.

===Discontinued use===
Daclizumab was approved and used to prevent acute rejection of kidney transplant, along with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. For that indication, side effects with a frequency of at least 10% included sleeplessness, tremor, headache, arterial hypertension, dyspnoea, gastrointestinal side effects and oedema. In rare cases, the drug could cause severe anaphylaxis.

==Contraindications==
In the US, daclizumab (while approved) was contraindicated in people with liver impairment, including significantly elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST) and autoimmune hepatitis.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) originally approved the drug without any contraindications apart from known hypersensitivity, but required Biogen to implement a hepatic risk management guide for physicians. In July 2017, the EMA has issued a provisional contraindication for patients with pre-existing liver disease or liver impairment. The marketing authorisation was withdrawn in the EU on 27 March 2018. An EMA review concluded that the medicine poses a risk of serious and potentially fatal immune reactions affecting the brain, liver and other organs.

==Adverse effects==
In clinical trials for MS, there were no treatment-related deaths or increased risk of cancer; side effects that occurred more frequently with daclizumab versus interferon included infections (65% versus 57%), skin rashes (37% versus 19%) and liver complications (approximately 18% versus 12%).

== Interactions ==

As an antibody, daclizumab is expected to have a very low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Daclizumab blocks IL-2 receptors containing the alpha subunit (CD25), which include the high-affinity receptors. Medium-affinity receptors, on the other hand, consist of two beta subunits (CD122) and are not affected by daclizumab. While the exact mechanism is unknown, the net effect is a reduction of T-cell responses and expansion of CD56bright natural killer cells.

===Pharmacokinetics===
After subcutaneous injection of a single dose, daclizumab has a bioavailability of about 90% and reaches highest blood plasma levels after 5 to 7 days. Given every four weeks, steady state concentrations are found after the fourth dose. It is expected that daclizumab, like other antibodies, is degraded by proteases to peptides and finally amino acids, and that it does not interact with cytochrome P450 liver enzymes.

The biological half-life is 21 days. Patients who developed antibodies against daclizumab eliminated it 19% faster.

==History==
Daclizumab was created by scientists at PDL BioPharma (called &quot;Protein Design Labs&quot; at that time) by humanizing the mouse mAb called anti-Tac, which targets CD25, the IL-2 receptor α chain; it blocks the interaction of IL-2 with the IL-2 receptor and prevents activation of T cells. Anti-Tac had been discovered by Thomas A. Waldmann, M.D., chief of the Metabolism Branch at the National Cancer Institute and his team, and they had conducted animal studies and a small clinical trial of anti-Tac in people with T-cell leukemia, with promising results, but people quickly developed their own antibodies rejecting the mouse protein; Waldman, and his colleagues then approached Protein Design Labs to humanize the antibody. PDL and the NIH scientists then approached Roche, a leader in transplant medicine development, to get the drug developed and approved, as PDL didn&#x27;t have the resources to actually bring the product to market. In March 2018 the drug was removed from the market worldwide.

In December 1997 daclizumab was approved by the FDA for use in preventing acute rejection of kidney transplants, in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids; it was the first humanized antibody approved anywhere in the world. At launch, the average wholesale price for the drug was estimated to be $6,800 for five doses and it was estimated that annual sales would be between $100 million and $250 million within five years of the launch and it was thought that the drug&#x27;s use would be expanded for use in other organ transplants. It was approved in Europe in 1999.

PDL began clinical trials of daclizumab on its own, and in September 2004 after the drug had shown promise in a Phase II trial, PDL and Roche agreed to expand their relationship to include codevelopment of daclizumab for asthma and other respiratory conditions. In August 2005, PDL and Biogen Idec agreed to collaborate to develop daclizumab in indications outside the fields of organ rejection and respiratory disease. In November 2005 Roche and PDL agreed to try to develop a formulation of daclizumab that would be useful as a subcutaneous injection for longterm maintenance in organ transplant. The next year Roche and PDL announced that the collaboration for all indications was ending, and in 2009 it announced that it was discontinuing Zenapax worldwide &quot;in view of available alternative treatments and the diminishing market demand&quot; and &quot;not due to any safety issue.&quot;

in 2008 PDL spun out its active development programs into a company called Facet Biotech and development of daclizumab for multiple sclerosis and the partnership with Biogen was included in that spinout. In 2009 Biogen attempted a hostile buy out of Facet for $350M; Facet rejected that offer and was purchased by Abbvie for $450 million in cash the next year. In May 2016 the FDA approved daclizumab for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis in adults in 2016 under the trade name Zinbryta, with requirements for postmarketing studies and to submit a formal Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy.

==Research==
Daclizumab has been studied in a small clinical trial of people with birdshot chorioretinopathy.

<doc id="530543" wikidata="Q3694662" url="?curid=530543" title="Walled City of Lahore">
<text>The Walled City of Lahore (; ; ), also known as the Old City, forms the historic core of the city of Lahore in Punjab, Pakistan. The city was established around 1000 CE in the western half of the Walled City, which was fortified by a mud wall during the medieval era. It has been the primary cultural centre of the Punjab region since the late-medieval era.

The Walled City rose in prominence after being selected as the Mughal capital, which resulted in the construction of the Lahore Fort – now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as the city&#x27;s new reinforced walls. The Walled City was bestowed with numerous monuments during the Mughal era, with some of Lahore&#x27;s most iconic structures being located in the Walled City, such as the lavishly decorated Wazir Khan Mosque, the massive Badshahi Mosque, and the Shahi Hammam. Under Sikh rule, the city was again selected as the capital, and the Walled City again rose in prominence with numerous religious buildings built in the Walled City at the time, including the Samadhi of Ranjit Singh, and the Gurdwara Janam Asthan Guru Ram Das.

The Walled City today remains the cultural heart of Lahore, and is home to many of its tourist attractions. In 2012, the &quot;Pilot Urban Conservation and Infrastructure Improvement Project—the Shahi Guzargah Project&quot; was launched to restore a section of &quot;Shahi Guzargah&quot; (&quot;Royal Passage&quot;) between the Wazir Khan Mosque and Delhi Gate under the management of the Walled City of Lahore Authority. The first phase of the project was completed in 2015 with support from the governments of Norway and the United States of America.

==History==

===Founding===
The origins of Lahore are vague. According to carbon dating evidence from archaeological finds in the Lahore Fort, settlements in the region have existed as early as 2,000 BCE. Lahore had many names throughout its history. Mohallah Maulian represents one of the two most probable sites of first the &quot;original&quot; Lahore.

===Medieval period===

Though the modern city&#x27;s founding may have been as early as 1000 CE, Lahore gained prominence only with the invasion of Muslim rulers from Central Asia. The city served as a capital during the Ghaznavid, Ghorid, and Delhi Sultanate periods, but was not widely mentioned until around 1400. Ibn Battuta knew of the city, but chose not to visit it, while Tamerlane spared the city destruction in his 1398 invasion, and delegated its sacking to a subordinate.

The entire city of Lahore during the medieval Ghaznavid era was probably located west of the modern Shah Alami, and north of the Bhatti Gate. Many of the city&#x27;s pre-Mughal tombs were built along the perimeter of this outline, including the Data Darbar shrine, the Tomb of Malik Ayaz, and the Aybak tomb. The modern &quot;Gumti&quot; Bazaar forms an arc along what may have been the southern boundary of the pre-Mughal city.

===Mughal period===

By the time of Mughal rule, a majority of its residents did not live within the walled city itself, but instead lived in suburbs that had spread outside of the city&#x27;s walls. Only 9 of the 36 urban quarters around Lahore, known as &quot;guzars&quot;, were located within the city&#x27;s walls during the Akbar period. During this period, Lahore was closely tied to smaller market towns known as &quot;qasbahs&quot;, such as Kasur, Eminabad, and Batala in modern-day India. These, in turn, linked Lahore&#x27;s markets to supply chains starting in villages surrounding each &quot;qasbah&quot;.

Urban administration under the Mughals was minimal, and most streets aside from major thoroughfares were privately maintained. The &quot;kotwal&quot; was imbued with the responsibility to manage day-to-day affairs in the city, and was subordinate to a &quot;Qazi&quot; judge. The local &quot;Mohalladar&quot; would surveil individual mohalla neighbourhoods, and register births and deaths within his mohallah. The positions were also maintained later during Sikh and British rule.

====Akbar====
Lahore&#x27;s eminence largely began after 1584, when the Emperor Akbar ordered a palace to be built at what is now the Lahore Fort after shifting his capital to Lahore from Fatehpur Sikri. He also ordered rebuilt and fortified the city&#x27;s walls, and ordered their extension east of the modern Shah Alami Bazaar to encompass an open plain known as the &quot;Rarra Maidan.&quot; Lahore&#x27;s old gates were also built around this time. Akbar also established the &quot;Akbari Mandi&quot; as a grain market at the city&#x27;s easternmost edge - a grain market that still exists in the present day. During his reign, Mughal nobles were encouraged to build palaces and gardens in and around Lahore, and many of Lahore&#x27;s first haveli mansions date from this period.

European visitors in the 16th and 17th centuries described the city as populous, with bazaars stocking valuable goods. Akbar&#x27;s court chronicler, Abu&#x27;l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, described the city as a &quot;grand resort of all countries&quot; with manufacturers that produced an astonishing variety of items. The Venetian traveler, Niccolao Manucci, described the city&#x27;s bazaars as being packed with foreigners.

====Jahangir====

During the reign of Emperor Jahangir, Lahore was still considered less important than the old Mughal capital of Agra, as evidenced by the construction of the Tomb of I&#x27;timād-ud-Daulah there rather than in Lahore. However, the importance of the city grew drastically with the presence of the Mughal Court, and the city&#x27;s suburbs spread out more than 5 kilometres beyond the Walled City. The Emperor Jahangir was later buried in an extravagant tomb in the Shahdara Bagh across the River Ravi, whose construction was overseen by his wife, Nur Jahan. The family of Nur Jahan built several garden-residences within and around the Walled City, and was later buried in Shahdara Bagh.

====Shah Jahan====

The Emperor Shah Jahan was born in Lahore in 1592, and bestowed the city with its famous Shalimar Gardens. By the time of his reign, six times as many Lahoris lived outside of the city walls than within. 
As a nobleman under Shah Jahan, Wazir Khan embarked on a program of architectural patronage. His first monumental project in the city was the Wazir Khan Mosque, built at the site of a simple pre-Mughal shrine. As Lahore&#x27;s first monumental mosque, it is lavishly embellished with extensive fresco-work that synthesizes Mughal and Punjabi influences. It is now considered to be the most ornately decorated Mughal-era mosque. He also built two other mosques in the Walled City, as well as the Shahi Hammam - famous for its lavish use of frescoes as a decorative element. He built for himself a haveli in the old city near the Shah Alami Bazaar called the &quot;Peri Mahal&quot;, or &quot;Fairy Palace.&quot; He also laid a pleasure garden south of the Walled City known as &quot;Nakhla Bagh&quot;, where he also built for himself a baradari.

====Aurangzeb====
Shah Jahan&#x27;s son, Emperor Aurangzeb, built the largest Mughal monument in Lahore, the iconic Badshahi Mosque. Emperor Aurangzeb also ordered the construction of the massive Alimgiri Gate at the Lahore Fort. He also improved civil infrastructure, and ordered the construction of the &quot;Alamgiri Bund&quot; - a channel built to divert the flow of the River Ravi.

===Sikh period===

Following the collapse of Mughal rule, Lahore ceased to function as an imperial city. Trade abruptly stopped, and large areas of the city&#x27;s suburbs were abandoned. By 1780, the city had fallen under the rule of small Sikh states known as &quot;Misls&quot;. The city and its revenues were partitioned among 3 Sikh chiefs - Gujjar Singh, Lahna Singh, and Sobha Singh. Instability during the &quot;Misl&quot; period contributed to the rise of nearby Amritsar as a commercial centre. The city&#x27;s population rapidly declined during this era, and the entire population of the city was said to live within the confines of the Walled City, with numerous citadels and suburbs depopulated.

Instability hindered Lahore&#x27;s progress until the arrival of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, who in 1799 made Lahore the Sikhs&#x27; administrative capital for the next 50 years, ruling from the Old City&#x27;s Lahore Fort. Though the city&#x27;s urban fabric lay in ruins by 1799, Sikh reconstruction from this era were based upon Mughal precedent. In 1812, they refurbished the city&#x27;s defenses and added a second circuit of walls around the city that largely followed the outline of walls from the Akbari period. Numerous Mughal monuments were damaged, desecrated, or destroyed during this period.

Ranjit Singh and his descendant bestowed the Walled City with religious monuments such as the Gurdwara Dera Sahib, Gurdwara Janam Asthan Guru Ram Das, and Samadhi of Ranjit Singh, and numerous Hindu temples, as well as secular buildings such as the Haveli of Nau Nihal Singh, and Hazuri Bagh Baradari. They also refurbished the nearby Shalimar Gardens, while numerous gardens were laid outside the city walls by Sikh nobles.

By the end of Sikh rule, most of Lahore&#x27;s massive Mughal haveli compounds had been occupied by settlers. New neighbourhoods occasionally grew up entirely within the confines of an old Mughal haveli, such as the Mohallah Pathran Wali, which grew within the ruins of a haveli of the same name that was built by Mian Khan. By 1831, all Mughal havelis in the Walled City had been encroached upon by the surrounding neighbourhood, leading to the modern-day absence of any Mughal havelis in Lahore.

===British period===

After the British captured Lahore from the Sikhs in 1846, annexation of the Punjab in 1849, the Walled City&#x27;s administrative practices were largely maintained. By the early 20th century, the Walled City&#x27;s mohallahs were incorporated into a new municipal administrative system. Several of the city&#x27;s older Mughal and Sikh monuments were repurposed by British authorities during their early rule, as resources for planning and building new administrative buildings were scarce. The Tomb of Anarkali, for example, was appropriated first for office space, before its conversion in 1851 into an Anglican church until 1891. It thereafter was used once again for civil purposes as a document repository - a function which it serves until present day. Chauburji was used as a police station during British rule. Several other Mughal tombs were used as residences by high ranking British administrators.

Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, British colonialists destroyed Lahore&#x27;s city walls, as well as its gateways, though several were later rebuilt. The British built the Lahore Junction railway station outside the city&#x27;s former walls, in a unique fortified style complete with turrets and crenellations, and loopholes for directing rifle fire. The Circular Garden which once encompassed the Walled City on three sides was established by 1892. The Walled City&#x27;s &quot;Rang Mahal&quot; was used first as a school for the American Presbyterian Mission, before being used as the first location of Lahore&#x27;s prestigious Forman Christian College in 1896.

The British regarded the Walled City as a potential hotbed for disease and social instability, and instead focused development away from the Walled City, and into suburban areas to the south and east, where numerous British-era buildings now stand, along with the Lahore Cantonment - originally laid by British administrators. By the early 20th century, the Walled City&#x27;s mohallahs came under the administration of British municipal laws which had only previously applied in Civil Station.

==Urban form ==
The city of Lahore during the Ghaznavid era was probably located in the southwest portion of today&#x27;s Walled City, with several of the city&#x27;s pre-Mughal tombs built along the perimeter of this area. The &quot;Gumti&quot; Bazaar forms an arc along what may have been the southern boundary of the pre-Mughal city. A mud fort is believed to have surrounded the medieval city, and may have been built by Malik Ayaz, the first Muslim governor of Lahore.

As late as 1864, the Lahori Mandi area had been known as &quot;kacha kot&quot;, meaning &quot;the mud fort,&quot; a name derived from the gradient of the land, the water flow, and the formation of &quot;mohallahs&quot;, &quot;kuchas&quot;, and &quot;kattrahs&quot;. The curve of &quot;Kucha Pir Bola&quot;. for example, merges with &quot;Waachowali&quot; Bazaar, the Lahori Bazaar merges with Chowk Lahori Mandi, and Chowk &quot;Mati&quot; merges with &quot;Papar Mandi&quot;, which may outline the old fort.

The Mughal period beginning in the Akbari period until the early 18th century most decisively determined the city&#x27;s character. Mughal Emperors embellished the city with monuments, and the city accumulated monuments from several different periods - in contrast to Fatehpur Sikri or Old Delhi which were largely built during the reign of a single Mughal Emperor. The Mughal city was divided into urban quarters known as &quot;guzārs&quot;. During the Akbari period, only 9 of Lahore&#x27;s 26 &quot;guzārs&quot; were located within the boundaries of Lahore&#x27;s city walls. Suburbs grew around the Walled City in areas to its east and south, and most was done in an &quot;ad hoc&quot; manner with concern paid to the developments immediate environment, rather than a larger masterplan.

During the Jahangir period, the city grew rapidly. Lahore&#x27;s suburban areas extended up to 5 kilometres from the Walled City. Empress Nur Jahan and her family built a number of residences and gardens within the Walled City, and outside of the city walls in the suburbs during this period. Her practice of building garden-residences successfully wove a culture of gardens into the rapidly urbanizing city.

Properties in the Walled City were often carved into smaller pieces over time. Inhabitants of the same building, and mohallah, were inhabited by members of different religions and castes. Though some neighbourhoods in the Walled City are named after individual groups, these areas did not remain homogeneous.

During the British era, the city&#x27;s eastern walls were shifted about 100 metres further east. Whereas Chitta Gate had served as the city&#x27;s original &quot;Delhi Gate&quot;, and previously opened directed onto Wazir Khan Chowk. During the British era, a new gate was built next to the Shahi Hammam, and new streets built in that area.

The Shah Alami Bazaar area was once a largely Hindu quarter of the Walled City, and was the busiest and most densely populated part of the city where sunlight would rarely reach the street below. During the 1947 riots that accompanied the Partition of British India, much of the area was burnt down, with rebuilding of the area beginning in 1949. Rebuilding was done in a contemporary style, rather than the historic style of the rest of the city, in order to widen streets and to create more commercial space.

The convoluted and picturesque streets of the inner city remain almost intact, but the rapid demolition and frequently illegal rebuilding taking place throughout the city is causing the historic fabric to be eroded and replaced by inferior constructions.

== Demographics ==

The Walled City of Lahore covers an area of 256 ha with a population of 200,000. Before partition, in 1947, the Walled City had a concentration of 48% Hindus, 38% Muslims and 12% Sikhs. Once Pakistan and India were formed - the area saw a mass exodus of Hindus and Sikhs, with the area now being populated primarily by the Punjabis from West Pakistan, immigrants from East Punjab (Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, of India) and Pashtuns. As of now, the population is 99% Muslims, comprising Punjabis, mostly.

In the past two decades, there has been an ever-increasing Pashtun population, with traders arriving and settling from the KPK, and parts of Afghanistan. This part of Lahore is a bustling community, with history etched in every corner of its streets, and attracts people from all across Pakistan, both for tourism and business purposes.

== Heritage sites ==

=== Lahore Fort ===

The Lahore Fort (Punjabi and : &quot;Shahi Qila&quot;, or &quot;Royal Fort&quot;) is a citadel at the northern end of Lahore&#x27;s Walled City that spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares. It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar. Some of its monuments are famous sites themselves, including the white marble Naulakha Pavilion, the Sheesh Mahal (&quot;Palace of Mirrors&quot;), Pearl Mosque, and the fort&#x27;s massive Picture Wall.

The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century, when the Mughal Empire was at the height of its splendour and opulence. In 1981, the fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its &quot;outstanding &quot; of Mughal monuments dating from the era when the empire was at its artistic and aesthetic .

=== Mosques===

==== Badshahi Mosque ====
The Badshahi Mosque (, or &quot;Imperial Mosque&quot;) is a Mughal era mosque built in 1671-73 that is located west of Lahore Fort, and fronts the fort across the Hazuri Bagh quadrangle. The architecture and design of the Badshahi Masjid is closely related to the Jama Masjid in Delhi, India, which was built in 1648 by Aurangzeb&#x27;s father and predecessor, Shah Jahan.

Badshahi Mosque was commissioned by Emperor Aurangzeb in 1671, with construction of the mosque lasting for two years until 1673. The mosque is an important example of Mughal architecture, with an exterior that is decorated with carved red sandstone with marble inlay. It is the largest and most recent of the grand imperial mosques of the Mughal-era, and is the second-largest mosque in Pakistan. The mosque is now widely considered to be one of Lahore&#x27;s most iconic landmarks.

==== Wazir Khan Mosque ====
The Wazir Khan Mosque (; &quot;Masjid Wazīr Khān&quot;) is a 17th-century mosque near the Delhi Gate and Chitta Gate that was commissioned during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as part of an ensemble of buildings that also included the nearby Shahi Hammam baths. Construction of Wazir Khan Mosque began in 1634 C.E., and was completed in 1641.

Considered to be the most ornately decorated Mughal-era mosque, Wazir Khan Mosque is renowned for its intricate faience tile work known as &quot;kashi-kari&quot;, as well as its interior surfaces that are almost entirely embellished with elaborate Mughal-era frescoes. The mosque has been under extensive restoration since 2009 under the direction of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the Government of Punjab, with contributions from the governments of Germany, Norway, and the United States.

====Begum Shahi Mosque====

The Begum Shahi Mosque () is an early 17th-century mosque that was built between 1611 and 1614 during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir in honour of his mother. It is Lahore&#x27;s earliest surviving example of a Mughal-era mosque, and influenced construction of the larger Wazir Khan Mosque a few decades later.

====Sunehri Mosque====
The Sunheri Mosque (, or &quot;Golden Mosque&quot;), also known as the Talai Mosque, is a late Mughal architecture-era mosque in Lahore&#x27;s walled city that is named in honour of its gilded domes. Unlike the Wazir Khan Mosque and Badshahi Mosque which were built at the zenith of the Mughal Empire in the 17th century, the Sunehri Mosque was built in 1753 when the empire was in decline.

During Sikh rule, the mosque was seized by Sikh authorities and converted into a gurdwara, after a copy of the Guru Granth Sahib was installed in the mosque following Sikhs complaints that the Muslim call to prayer from the mosque was disturbing their religious ceremonies at a newly constructed &quot;baoli&quot; (stepped well) nearby.

====Neevin Mosque====

The Neevin Mosque (), is a 15th-century mosque built during the Lodi dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. Neevin Mosque is notable for its foundation 25 feet below street level. The mosque is further noted for being one of Lahore&#x27;s few remaining pre-Mughal monuments.

===Gurdwaras===
====Samadhi of Ranjit Singh ====

The Samadhi of Ranjit Singh () is a 19th-century shrine that houses the funerary urns of the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh (1780 - 1839). It is located adjacent the Lahore Fort and Badshahi Mosque, as well the Gurdwara Dera Sahib which marks the spot where the 5th guru of Sikhism, Guru Arjan Dev, died.

====Gurdwara Dera Sahib ====
Gurdwara Dera Sahib () commemorates the spot where the 5th guru of Sikhism, Guru Arjan Dev, died in 1606. Construction of the building was started by Kharak Singh on the spot where he was cremated, and was completed by his youngest son, Duleep Singh in 1848. The gurdwara combines elements of Sikh, Hindu, and Islamic architecture. Portions of the building are believed to have been plundered from the adjacent Lahore Fort.

====Janam Asthan Guru Ram Das ====

The Gurdwara Janam Asthan Guru Ram Das () is a gurdwara built atop the site traditionally believed to be the location of the birthplace and childhood home of Guru Ram Das, the 4th Sikh gurus. The gurdwara is located in the &quot;Chuna Mandi&quot; Bazaar in the Walled City of Lahore, near the Lahore Fort, and Begum Shahi Mosque. The shrine is located along the &quot;Shahi Guzargah&quot;, or &quot;Royal Passage&quot; that began at Delhi Gate, and terminated at the Lahore Fort.

=== Havelis ===

There are many havelis inside the Walled City of Lahore, some in good condition while others need urgent attention. Many of these havlis are fine examples of Mughal and Sikh Architecture. Some of the havelis inside the Walled City include:

====Haveli of Nau Nihal Singh====
The Haveli of Nau Nihal Singh () is considered to be one of the finest examples of Sikh architecture in Lahore, and is the only Sikh-era haveli that preserves its original ornamentation and architecture. The haveli is noted for its lavishly decorated western façade, displaying vivid Kangra-style painting. The site has been used as a girls&#x27; school since the British colonial-era.

* Nisar Haveli
* Mubarak Haveli
* Haveli Barood Khana
* Mubarak Begum Haveli
* Salman Sirhindi&#x27;s Haveli
* Haveli of Dina Nath

=== Other landmarks ===
====Royal baths====

The Shahi Hammam (; &quot;Royal Baths&quot;), is a Persian-style bath which was built in 1635 C.E. during the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan. The Shahi Hammam is noted for its extensive embellishment with Mughal-era frescoes that have recently been restored. The baths were built to serve as a &quot;waqf&quot;, or endowment, for the maintenance of the Wazir Khan Mosque.

No longer used as a hammam, the baths were restored between 2013 and 2015 by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the Walled City of Lahore Authority. The restoration project was given an Award of Merit by UNESCO in 2016 for the hammam&#x27;s successful conservation which returned it to its &quot;former prominence.&quot;

====Hazuri Bagh Baradari====

The Hazuri Bagh Baradari () is a baradari of white marble located in the Hazuri Bagh quadrangle, which forms the space between the Alamgiri Gate of the Lahore Fort, and the Badshahi Mosque. It was built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, Sikh ruler of Punjab in 1818. The pavilion consisted of two storeys until it was damaged by lightning in 1932.

====Fort Road Food Street====
The Fort Road Food Street () is a pedestrianised area located on the Fort Road within the walled city that is dedicated to culinary stalls and restaurants specialising Lahori cuisine. The street has colourful lights and views of Badshahi Mosque and is near the Roshnai Gate

==== Gates ====
The Walled City of Lahore once had 13 gates. All survived until the 1857 Uprising when in an effort to de-fortify the city, all but one of the gates were destroyed by the British. Three were rebuilt as simpler structures, while the Delhi Gate, Shah Alami Gate, and Lohari Gate were built in a more elaborate style. The Shah Alami Gate was destroyed during riots following the Partition of British India.

=====Former gates=====

== Conservation ==
===&quot;Shahi Guzargah&quot; Project===
In 2012, the &quot;Pilot Urban Conservation and Infrastructure Improvement Project—the Shahi Guzargah Project&quot; was launched by the Government of Punjab and the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (an agency of the AKDN) which restored a section of &quot;Shahi Guzargah&quot; (&quot;Royal Passage&quot;) between the Wazir Khan Mosque and Delhi Gate under the management of the Walled City of Lahore Authority. The project was completed in 2015 with support from the governments of Norway and the United States of America.

Prior to completion of the project&#x27;s first phase, the vicinity around the Wazir Khan Mosque had been encroached upon by illegally erected shops which blocked off much of the mosque from the surrounding neighborhood. Tangled power lines further spoiled views of the mosque, and the Wazir Khan Chowk had been badly neglected and had shrunk in size due to illegally constructed shops. The first phase of the project removed illegally constructed shops, restoring views of the mosque. Wazir Khan Chowk was extensively rehabilitated by the removal of encroachments, while the well of &quot;Dina Nath&quot; was restored. Power lines along the project corridor were also placed underground, and the Chitta Gate at the eastern entrance to Wazir Khan Chowk was rehabilitated.

<text>Großauheim (13,369 inhabitants, without Wolfgang 11,669) is the largest district of Hanau, Hesse, Germany, on the north bank of the Main. It was first mentioned in 806 under the name &quot;Ewichheim&quot;. It was a farming village until the end of the 19th century but during the 20th century, numerous branches of industry settled there. The Hanau Port built in 1924 is mainly in Großauheim. In 1956, Großauheim was made a free town. In 1972, Großauheim included Wolfgang but due to the Hessian regional reform, Großauheim and Wolfgang were incorporated into Hanau in July 1974. In the 1970s, the industry began to migrate and it has almost vanished today. It was the site of multiple American military bases until 2008.

A well-known &quot;Auheim Child&quot; is the famous German sculptor August Gaul.

In honor of Saint Rochus, who was beseeched for relieving the town from pestilence, a yearly procession is done to a central place &quot;Rochusplatz&quot; in the town, where a memorial of the Saint Rochus stands today. The &quot;Rochusmarkt&quot; (&quot;Rochus market&quot;) takes place every year in September in the town center of Großauheim.

Großauheim&#x27;s twin town is the French town Conflans-Sainte-Honorine which is located near Paris on the river Seine.

<text>Jaan Einasto (born 23 February 1929) is an Estonian astrophysicist and one of the discoverers of the large-scale structure of the Universe.

==Family and early life==
Born Jaan Eisenschmidt in Tartu, the name &quot;Einasto&quot; is an anagram of &quot;Estonia&quot; (it was chosen by his patriotic father in the 1930s to replace the family&#x27;s German name). 

Einasto married and had 3 children, 2 daughters and the youngest, a son. His daughter, Maret, is also an astrophysicist, who collaborates with her father.

==Education and career==
He attended the University of Tartu, where he received the Ph.D. equivalent in 1955 and a senior research doctorate in 1972. From 1952, he has worked as a scientist at the Tartu Observatory (1977–1998) Head of the Department of Cosmology; from 1992–1995, he was Professor of Cosmology at the University of Tartu. For a long time, he was Head of the Division of Astronomy and Physics of the Estonian Academy of Sciences in Tallinn. Einasto is a member of the Academia Europaea, the European Astronomical Society and the Royal Astronomical Society; he has received three Estonian National Science Awards.

*1947 Tartu Secondary School No. 1
*1952 University of Tartu
*1955 Cand.Sc. in physics and mathematics
*1972 D.Sc. in physics and mathematics
*1992 Professor

Since 1991 he is member of Academia Europaea. Since 1994 he is member of the Royal Astronomical Society.

In 1974, in a seminal work with Kaasik and Saar at the Tartu Observatory, Einasto argued that &quot;it is necessary to adopt an alternative hypothesis: that the clusters of galaxies are stabilised by hidden matter.&quot; This was a key paper in recognizing that a hidden matter, i.e., dark matter, could explain observational anomalies in astronomy.

Einasto showed in 1977 at a Symposium in Tallinn (Estonia) that the universe has a cell structure, in which the observed matter surrounds huge empty voids.

==Awards, honours, legacy==
The asteroid 11577 Einasto, discovered in 1994, is named in his honour.

The Einasto Supercluster, a galaxy supercluster discovered in 2024, is named in his honour.

<doc id="530559" wikidata="Q1656686" url="?curid=530559" title="Ideal (order theory)">
<text>In mathematical order theory, an ideal is a special subset of a partially ordered set (poset). Although this term historically was derived from the notion of a ring ideal of abstract algebra, it has subsequently been generalized to a different notion. Ideals are of great importance for many constructions in order and lattice theory.

== Definitions==

A subset of a partially ordered set formula_1 is an ideal, if the following conditions hold:

# is non-empty,
# for every &quot;x&quot; in and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;P&quot;, implies that &quot;y&quot; is in  ( is a lower set),
# for every &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in , there is some element &quot;z&quot; in , such that and  ( is a directed set).

While this is the most general way to define an ideal for arbitrary posets, it was originally defined for lattices only. In this case, the following equivalent definition can be given:
a subset of a lattice formula_1 is an ideal if and only if it is a lower set that is closed under finite joins (suprema); that is, it is nonempty and for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in , the element formula_3 of &quot;P&quot; is also in .

A weaker notion of order ideal is defined to be a subset of a poset that satisfies the above conditions 1 and 2. In other words, an order ideal is simply a lower set. Similarly, an ideal can also be defined as a &quot;directed lower set&quot;.

The dual notion of an ideal, i.e., the concept obtained by reversing all ≤ and exchanging formula_4 with formula_5 is a filter.

Frink ideals, pseudoideals and Doyle pseudoideals are different generalizations of the notion of a lattice ideal.

An ideal or filter is said to be proper if it is not equal to the whole set &quot;P&quot;.

The smallest ideal that contains a given element &quot;p&quot; is a and &quot;p&quot; is said to be a of the ideal in this situation. The principal ideal formula_6 for a principal &quot;p&quot; is thus given by .

== Terminology confusion ==
The above definitions of &quot;ideal&quot; and &quot;order ideal&quot; are the standard ones, but there is some confusion in terminology. Sometimes the words and definitions such as &quot;ideal&quot;, &quot;order ideal&quot;, &quot;Frink ideal&quot;, or &quot;partial order ideal&quot; mean one another.

==Prime ideals==

An important special case of an ideal is constituted by those ideals whose set-theoretic complements are filters, i.e. ideals in the inverse order. Such ideals are called s. Also note that, since we require ideals and filters to be non-empty, every prime ideal is necessarily proper. For lattices, prime ideals can be characterized as follows:

A subset of a lattice formula_1 is a prime ideal, if and only if

# is a proper ideal of &quot;P&quot;, and
# for all elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; of &quot;P&quot;, formula_8 in implies that or .

It is easily checked that this is indeed equivalent to stating that formula_9 is a filter (which is then also prime, in the dual sense).

For a complete lattice the further notion of a is meaningful.
It is defined to be a proper ideal with the additional property that, whenever the meet (infimum) of some arbitrary set is in , some element of &quot;A&quot; is also in .
So this is just a specific prime ideal that extends the above conditions to infinite meets.

The existence of prime ideals is in general not obvious, and often a satisfactory amount of prime ideals cannot be derived within ZF (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice).
This issue is discussed in various prime ideal theorems, which are necessary for many applications that require prime ideals.

==Maximal ideals==

An ideal is a if it is proper and there is no &quot;proper&quot; ideal &quot;J&quot; that is a strict superset of . Likewise, a filter &quot;F&quot; is maximal if it is proper and there is no proper filter that is a strict superset.

When a poset is a distributive lattice, maximal ideals and filters are necessarily prime, while the converse of this statement is false in general.

Maximal filters are sometimes called ultrafilters, but this terminology is often reserved for Boolean algebras, where a maximal filter (ideal) is a filter (ideal) that contains exactly one of the elements {&quot;a&quot;, ¬&quot;a&quot;}, for each element &quot;a&quot; of the Boolean algebra. In Boolean algebras, the terms &quot;prime ideal&quot; and &quot;maximal ideal&quot; coincide, as do the terms &quot;prime filter&quot; and &quot;maximal filter&quot;.

There is another interesting notion of maximality of ideals: Consider an ideal and a filter &quot;F&quot; such that is disjoint from &quot;F&quot;. We are interested in an ideal &quot;M&quot; that is maximal among all ideals that contain and are disjoint from &quot;F&quot;. In the case of distributive lattices such an &quot;M&quot; is always a prime ideal. A proof of this statement follows.

However, in general it is not clear whether there exists any ideal &quot;M&quot; that is maximal in this sense. Yet, if we assume the axiom of choice in our set theory, then the existence of &quot;M&quot; for every disjoint filter–ideal-pair can be shown. In the special case that the considered order is a Boolean algebra, this theorem is called the Boolean prime ideal theorem. It is strictly weaker than the axiom of choice and it turns out that nothing more is needed for many order-theoretic applications of ideals.

==Applications==

The construction of ideals and filters is an important tool in many applications of order theory.
* In Stone&#x27;s representation theorem for Boolean algebras, the maximal ideals (or, equivalently via the negation map, ultrafilters) are used to obtain the set of points of a topological space, whose clopen sets are isomorphic to the original Boolean algebra.
* Order theory knows many completion procedures to turn posets into posets with additional completeness properties. For example, the ideal completion of a given partial order &quot;P&quot; is the set of all ideals of &quot;P&quot; ordered by subset inclusion. This construction yields the free dcpo generated by &quot;P&quot;. An ideal is principal if and only if it is compact in the ideal completion, so the original poset can be recovered as the sub-poset consisting of compact elements. Furthermore, every algebraic dcpo can be reconstructed as the ideal completion of its set of compact elements.

==History==

Ideals were introduced by Marshall H. Stone first for Boolean algebras, where the name was derived from the ring ideals of abstract algebra. He adopted this terminology because, using the isomorphism of the categories of Boolean algebras and of Boolean rings, the two notions do indeed coincide.

Generalization to any posets was done by Frink.

<doc id="530563" wikidata="Q645107" url="?curid=530563" title="Argentavis">
<text>Argentavis is an extinct genus of teratornithid known from three sites in the Epecuén and Andalhualá Formations in central and northwestern Argentina dating to the Late Miocene (Huayquerian). The type species, A. magnificens, is sometimes called the giant teratorn. &quot;Argentavis&quot; was among the largest flying birds to ever exist, holding the record for heaviest flying bird, although it was surpassed in wingspan after the 2014 description of &quot;Pelagornis sandersi,&quot; which is estimated to have possessed wings some 20% longer than those of &quot;Argentavis&quot;.

== Discovery and naming ==
In the 1970s while on an expedition by the Museo de La Plata, paleontologists Rosendo Pascual and Eduardo Tonni unearthed a fragmentary skeleton consisting of a partial skull, right coracoid, left humerus, portions of the left ulna, left radius, and left metacarpals, and shafts of the right tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus. Later restudy of the specimen also found an incomplete ungual phalanx with the skeleton. These fossils had been exposed in brown-red silt and clay sediments from the Epecuén Formation in Salinas Grandes de Hidalgo in Atreucó, Argentina. These outcrops derive from the Huayquerian stage of the upper Miocene (9.0-6.8 mya). This specimen was deposited at the Museo de La Plata under catalogue number MLP 65-VII-29-49 and cast at the Los Angeles County Museum.

These fossils were described by paleontologists Kenneth Campbell Jr. and Eduardo Tonni in 1980, who named the new genus and species &quot;Argentavis magnificens&quot; with MLP 65-VII-29-49 as the holotype specimen. The generic name &quot;Argentavis&quot; is derived from the Latin root &quot;argentum&quot;, “silver”, after the country of origin, and &quot;avis&quot;, “bird”, while the specific name &quot;magnificens&quot;, “magnificent”, refers to its size. In the description, &quot;Argentavis&quot; was classified as a member of Teratornithidae and was the first described from South America. Since &quot;Argentavis&quot;&#x27; description, &quot;Taubatornis&quot; was named and a multitude of specimens described from the continent. Later in 1995, Campbell described three additional &quot;Argentavis&quot; specimens that had been discovered in other sites in Argentina. One, an ungual phalanx, was unearthed in an Epecuén Formation outcrops around 60 km northeast of the holotype locality. Campbell assigned it to &quot;A. magnificens&quot; based on the development of grooves and tubercles on the bone, however due to the lack of overlap with the holotype and its robust morphology a 2011 article classified it as phorusrhacid. Additionally, a fragmentary coracoid and the distal end of a tibiotarsus were collected from sediments of the Huayquerian-aged Andalhualá Formation in Valle de Santa María in Catamarca Province, northwest Argentina.

== Description ==
The single known humerus (upper arm bone) of &quot;Argentavis&quot; is somewhat damaged. Even so, it allows a fairly accurate estimate of its length in life. &quot;Argentavis&quot;&#x27; humerus was only slightly shorter than an entire human arm. The species had stout, strong legs and large feet which indicate decent terrestrial capabilities. The bill was large, rather slender, and had a hooked tip with a wide gape.

=== Size ===
Estimates for &quot;Argentavis&#x27;&quot; wingspan vary widely depending on the method used for scaling, i.e. regression analyses or comparisons with the California condor. At one time, published wingspans for the species measured up to in width, but more recent estimates put the wingspan within the range of . Recent studies present doubts on the wingspan of the species reaching or exceeding . At the time of description, &quot;Argentavis&quot; was the largest flying bird known to have existed but it has since been exceeded by another extinct species, &quot;Pelagornis sandersi&quot;, in wingspan, which the 2014 description estimated at . For comparison, the living bird with the largest wingspan is the wandering albatross, averaging and spanning up to . When grounded, &quot;Argentavis&quot;&#x27; height has been estimated at , roughly equivalent to that of an adult human. Furthermore, its total length (from bill tip to tail tip) was approximately .

Prior publications estimated the body mass of &quot;Argentavis&quot; at , but more refined techniques show a more typical mass would likely have been somewhere between , although weights could have varied depending on conditions. &quot;Argentavis&quot; still retains the title of the heaviest known flying bird by a considerable margin, with the aforementioned &quot;P. sandersi&quot; being estimated to have weighed no more than . Since &quot;A. magnificens&quot; is known to have lived in terrestrial environments, another good point of comparison is the Andean condor, the largest extant flighted land bird both in average wingspan and weight, with the former spanning up to with an average of around , and the latter reaching a maximum of up to . New World vultures such as the condor are thought to be the closest living relatives to &quot;Argentavis&quot; and other teratorns. Average weights are much lower in both the wandering albatross and Andean condor than in &quot;Argentavis&quot;, at approximately and , respectively.

As a rule of thumb, a wing loading of 25 kg/m2 is considered the limit for avian flight. A number of estimates related to wing loading have been produced for &quot;Argentavis&quot;, most notably the wing area, estimated at , and the wing loading, estimated at 84.6 N/m2 (1.77 lb/ft2), or about 8.64 kg/m2. The heaviest extant flying birds are known to weigh up to a maximum of (there are several contenders, among which are the European great bustard and the African kori bustard). An individual mute swan, which may have lost the power of flight due to extreme weight, was found to have weighed . Meanwhile, the sarus crane is the tallest flying bird alive, at up to tall, standing about as high as &quot;Argentavis&quot; due to its long legs and neck.

== Paleobiology ==
=== Life history ===
Comparison with extant birds suggests &quot;Argentavis&quot; laid one or two eggs with a mass of around every two years. Climate considerations make it likely that the birds incubated during the winter, with members of a mated pair alternating between incubating and procuring food every few days. The young are thought to have been independent after some 16 months, but to not reach full maturity until they reached roughly twelve years of age. To maintain a viable population, no more than 2% of birds could have died each year. Because of its large size and ability to fly, &quot;Argentavis&quot; suffered hardly any predation, and mortality was mainly related to old age and disease in adults.

=== Flight ===
From the size and structure of its wings, it is inferred that &quot;A. magnificens&quot; flew mainly by soaring, using flapping flight only during short periods. This is further supported by skeletal evidence, which suggests that its breast muscles were not powerful enough to enable flapping of the wings for extended periods. Studies on condor flight indicate that &quot;Argentavis&quot; was fully capable of flight in normal conditions, as modern large soaring birds spend very little time flapping their wings regardless of environment.

Although its legs were strong enough to provide it with a running or jumping start, the wings were simply too long to flap effectively until the bird had gained some vertical distance, meaning that, especially for takeoff, &quot;Argentavis&quot; would have depended on the wind. &quot;Argentavis&quot; may have used mountain slopes and headwinds to take off, and probably could manage to do so even from gently sloped terrain with little effort. It may have flown and lived much like the modern Andean condor, scanning large areas of land for carrion. It is probable that it utilised thermal currents to stay aloft, and it has been estimated that the minimal velocity for &quot;A. magnificens&quot; is about or . The climate of the Andean foothills in Argentina during the late Miocene was warmer and drier than today, which would have further aided the bird in staying aloft atop thermal updrafts.

=== Food ===
&quot;Argentavis&quot;″ territories probably measured more than , which the birds screened for food, possibly utilizing a north–south flying pattern to avoid being slowed by adverse winds. This species seems less aerodynamically suited for predation than its relatives and probably preferred to scavenge for carrion. &quot;Argentavis&quot; may have used its wings and size to intimidate metatherian mammals and small phorusrhacids to take over their kills. Phorusrhacids were the largest land predators in Miocene South America, and probably the biggest threats that &quot;Argentavis&quot; faced, with the largest species that coexisted with &quot;Argentavis&quot;, &quot;Devincenzia&quot;, weighing up to .

<doc id="530566" wikidata="Q546302" url="?curid=530566" title="Wish (The Cure album)">
<text>Wish is the ninth studio album by English rock band the Cure, released on 21 April 1992 by Fiction Records in the United Kingdom and Elektra Records in the United States. &quot;Wish&quot; was the most commercially successful album in the band&#x27;s career, debuting at number one in the UK and number two in the US.

On 25 November 2022, a remastered 30th-anniversary deluxe edition of &quot;Wish&quot; was released, containing four previously unreleased demos with vocals, instrumental demos, the &quot;Lost Wishes&quot; instrumental cassette and remix versions.

== Recording ==
The record is the final studio album by the Cure to feature drummer Boris Williams and the first to feature guitarist/keyboardist Perry Bamonte, who previously worked as a roadie for the band, as well as being the last album to feature guitarist Porl Thompson for sixteen years.

Whilst retaining their trademark gothic rock sound and mood on some tracks, &quot;Wish&quot; often found the band emphasizing the lighter, broader guitar-driven alternative rock direction that was hinted on their previous three records. According to Thompson, &quot;Wish&quot; was recorded on 48 tracks and &quot;almost everything was used&quot;. Robert Smith also revealed the hit song &quot;Friday I&#x27;m in Love&quot; was accidentally sped up a quarter-tone sharp on the tape, halfway between D and E-flat. Smith commented on the speeding up of the tape of the song in a 1993 interview: &quot;[…] that was an accident. I was playing with the vari-speed and forgot to turn it off. But the whole feel changed, and the fact that it&#x27;s the only song on Wish that&#x27;s not in concert pitch really lifts it out and makes it sound different. After working on the record for months, hearing something a quarter-tone off makes your brain take a step backwards.&quot; Smith also revealed that the &quot;detuning&quot; of the guitars played a role in the unique &quot;sound&quot; of the album, as did the subliminal overdubs and the extensive use of feedback. &quot;A lot of things on our record that sound like heavy chorusing are actually just detuned instruments. The only drawback to that is onstage it&#x27;s very confusing sometimes, especially with lots of phasing effects going on. It turns into this overwhelming pulsing sound, and you can&#x27;t hear anything.&quot; &quot;From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea&quot; is considered by many to be their greatest track and a live anthem.

Smith also revealed that the songs &quot;Mesmerise&quot; by Chapterhouse, and &quot;Human&quot; by The Human League were an influence on the album, he commented on both songs in 1993: &quot;For every album we do, I assemble a bunch of songs that have something that I&#x27;m trying to capture. For &quot;Wish&quot;, I would listen to &#x27;Mesmerise&#x27; by Chapterhouse for its feeling of abandon and &#x27;Human&#x27; by The Human League. You couldn&#x27;t spot anything sonically or structurally that would influence anything we did, but there&#x27;s an indefinable something that I&#x27;m trying to capture. One night I must have played &#x27;Mesmerise&#x27; 20 times, drinking and turning it louder and louder, putting myself into a trance.&quot;

== Release ==
The album&#x27;s lead single was &quot;High&quot;, released on 16 March 1992. The single peaked at number eight on the UK Singles Chart, number 42 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Friday I&#x27;m in Love&quot;, was released on 15 May 1992, a Friday, later reaching number six on the UK Singles Chart, number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number one on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The final single was &quot;A Letter to Elise&quot;, issued on 5 October 1992. This song reached number twenty-eight in the UK and number two on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.

&quot;Wish&quot; was released on 21 April. It received positive reviews upon release, including a four-star review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that stated: &quot;For its cult of millions, the Cure offers the only kind of optimism that makes sense.&quot; &quot;Wish&quot; was also the band&#x27;s overall highest-charting album, and most commercially successful in the band&#x27;s career. Upon release, &quot;Wish&quot; would soon debut at number one on the UK Albums Chart, and number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It also reached number one on &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 200 Pop Albums chart in the US on 16 May 1992. &quot;Wish&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1993.

On 16 November 1993, a limited-edition EP titled &quot;Lost Wishes&quot; was released on cassette with four new tracks on it. In 1995, &quot;Q&quot; included &quot;Wish&quot; in its publication &quot;In Our Lifetime: &quot;Q&quot;″s 100 Best Albums 1986–94&quot;, a list compiled to celebrate its 100th issue. In 2000 it was voted number 646 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

==Reissues==
On 13 April 2018, in an interview with BBC Radio 6 Music, Robert Smith confirmed that the deluxe edition of &quot;Wish&quot; had been finished. On 28 July 2022, the band announced a remastered and expanded 30th-anniversary deluxe edition of &quot;Wish&quot;, releasing it on 25 November 2022. The 30th-anniversary edition contains 24 previously unreleased demos, out-takes, the &quot;Lost Wishes&quot; EP and a collection of 12-inch remixes of all three singles from the &quot;Wish&quot; period. The recordings were remastered by Smith and Miles Showell at Abbey Road Studios.

<doc id="530567" wikidata="Q297173" url="?curid=530567" title="Bam Margera">
<text>Brandon Cole &quot;Bam&quot; Margera ( ; born September 28, 1979) is an American former professional skateboarder, stunt performer, television personality, and filmmaker. He rose to prominence in the early 2000s as one of the stars of the MTV reality stunt show &quot;Jackass&quot; and subsequent films. He also created the spin-off shows &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; (2003–2006), &quot;Bam&#x27;s Unholy Union&quot; (2007), &quot;Bam&#x27;s World Domination&quot; (2010), and &quot;Bam&#x27;s Bad Ass Game Show&quot; (2014), and co-wrote and directed the films &quot;&quot; (2003), and &quot;&quot; (2009).

Since the mid-2000s, Margera has struggled with alcoholism and subsequent legal troubles. He first entered rehab in 2009 but left after four days and has since had at least seven subsequent attempts at rehab without completing the program. Following the death of childhood friend Ryan Dunn and the end of his television projects in 2011–12, Margera&#x27;s drinking and drug use intensified. In 2020, he was fired from the production of &quot;Jackass Forever&quot; (2022) due to his drug and alcohol issues.

==Early life and &quot;CKY&quot; videos==
Margera was born on September 28, 1979, and raised in West Chester, Pennsylvania, the son of April and Phil Margera. He is the younger brother of rock musician Jess Margera and nephew of television personality Vincent &quot;Don Vito&quot; Margera. His grandfather nicknamed him &quot;Bam Bam&quot; at the age of three after noticing his habit of purposely running into walls; over time, that nickname was shortened to &quot;Bam&quot; by his schoolmates. Before their television fame, Margera&#x27;s parents April and Phil worked as a hairdresser and baker respectively.

Margera got his first video camera from his father in 1993 after he enrolled in a digital media class with childhood friend Chris Raab, where they also met future collaborators Art Webb, Brandon DiCamillo, and Ryan Dunn. They began shooting videos of Margera and his friends skateboarding and doing stunts, which eventually turned into the &quot;CKY&quot; video series. CKY stands for &quot;Camp Kill Yourself&quot;, a name shared with his brother Jess Margera&#x27;s band, CKY, which was named as a tribute to the film &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; (1983). 

In 1994, Margera dropped out of school after Chris Raab was expelled, but was homeschooled by his mother and received his GED. On September 21, 1995, Margera, his brother Jess, Dunn and Raab were involved in a serious car accident near their home town. In later interviews, Margera revealed that Raab had &quot;forced him&quot; to wear a seatbelt as the car was going nearly 100mph, and that this probably saved his life. Other than his brother Jess suffering a broken arm, none of the four were seriously injured.

Following years of recording and editing, Margera independently released the first &quot;CKY&quot; film, then titled &quot;&quot;, in 1999. The film is a collection of stunts and pranks interspersed with skateboarding tricks and footage set to music by CKY. Subsequent releases of the film removed the &quot;Landspeed&quot; subtitle. In the following years, the sequels &quot;CKY2K&quot;, &quot;CKY3&quot; and &quot;CKY4: The Latest and Greatest&quot; were released. These early videos feature many of Margera&#x27;s friends, including Dunn, Raab, DiCamillo, Rake Yohn and Brandon Novak, who formed a loose collective known as the CKY crew. During this period, the videos and band projects were heavily interlinked, with two of the band&#x27;s albums being unofficial soundtracks to the videos.

==Career==

===Television and film===
Following CKY&#x27;s success, former &quot;Big Brother&quot; editor Jeff Tremaine noticed Margera&#x27;s videos and drafted him into the team that would eventually become MTV&#x27;s &quot;Jackass&quot;. Margera and Ryan Dunn became mainstays of the cast while other CKY crew members played supporting roles to various degrees. In the original series, several of the features stunts were taken directly from the CKY videos. Margera went on to appear in &quot;&quot; (2002), &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot; (2006), &quot;Jackass 2.5&quot; (2007), &quot;Jackass 3D&quot; (2010), and &quot;Jackass 3.5&quot; (2011), with a minor appearance in &quot;Jackass Forever&quot; (2022). Several skits in the first &quot;Jackass&quot; movie were CKY-style pieces filmed in and around West Chester, while similar scenes in the second movie were removed after the arrest and conviction of Margera&#x27;s uncle Vincent Margera (also known as Don Vito) inappropriately touching two minors.

After the &quot;Jackass&quot; series ended in 2002, Margera was given a follow-up, &quot;Viva La Bam&quot;, which ran for five seasons from 2003 to 2005. A mixture of stunts and reality, the show followed Margera and his crew as they performed various stunts and missions, but also offered insight into their daily lives. The show was primarily filmed in West Chester but also visited New Orleans, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Brazil, Finland, Mexico, Netherlands, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Monaco, and Transylvania. In addition to the regular series, special episodes have included &quot;Viva La Spring Break&quot; and a &quot;lost&quot; episode included on the &quot;Viva La Bands&quot; CD, which was originally filmed in Iceland for the first season. A two-part special episode, &quot;Viva La Spring Break&quot;, aired in 2006.

In 2003, Margera played himself in the movie &quot;Grind&quot;, which portrays four young men following a professional skateboarder from Chicago to California. The film contains numerous cameos by &quot;Jackass&quot; members, as well as many professional skateboarders and other celebrities. Upon release, it was met with generally unfavorable reviews from critics, but was rated much higher by the general public.

In 2007, Margera&#x27;s engagement and wedding planning was filmed for &quot;Bam&#x27;s Unholy Union&quot; as a follow-up to &quot;Viva la Bam&quot;. The show follows Margera, his then-fiancée Missy Rothstein, and their friends in the lead-up to their wedding. In 2008, Margera had a &quot;prominent, non-sex role&quot; in a pornographic film by Gina Lynn, &quot;The Fantasstic Whores 4&quot;, with Brandon Novak. In 2009, Margera appeared on &quot;Nitro Circus&quot;, and the following year Margera starred alongside Dunn and skateboarder Tim O&#x27;Connor in the one-off special &quot;Bam&#x27;s World Domination&quot; on Spike TV, which showcased Margera and his friends&#x27; attempt to conquer an obstacle course race in the Tough Guy Competition, held in Staffordshire, England.

In March 2016, Bam and his parents appeared on the VH1 reality television show &quot;Family Therapy with Dr. Jenn&quot; to address Bam&#x27;s self-destructive behavior.

===Skateboarding career===

Margera started skateboarding at age 7, and by the time he entered high school it had developed into a full-time hobby. His brother Jess later described his abilities as &quot;a natural talent&quot; and noted that their parents had been very supportive of Margera&#x27;s decision to go into skateboarding &quot;from day one&quot;, and revealed that he used to travel with Bam to Love Park in Philadelphia as early as 1991, when they were 12 and 13 years old. In 1992, Margera got his first sponsorship from Fairman&#x27;s Skate Shop and began appearing in skate videos. In 1994, Margera dropped out of high school to pursue a full-time skateboarding career.

Early in his professional career, Margera was sponsored by Toy Machine Skateboards, Speed Metal Bearings, Adio Footwear, Electric Sunglasses, Volcom, Landspeed Wheels, Destroyer Trucks, Destructo Trucks, and Fairman&#x27;s Skateshop. In 2001, Margera became a member of Team Element, the demonstration team for Element Skateboards, which he remained affiliated with for the rest of his professional career.

In 2012, Margera was forced to put his skating career on hold due to bone spurs and worsening alcoholism. After a five-year hiatus, he returned to skateboarding casually, resulting in a renewed partnership with Element Skateboards to celebrate the brand&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 2017, by re-releasing a series of ten of his most memorable deck designs. The boards were released weekly between September 6 and November 8, 2017; each deck is signed by Margera and limited to 50 units. 

As of 2024, Margera is without any major sponsorships.

=== Independent films ===
Margera has written, produced and starred in three independent films as of 2024, with a fourth scheduled but on hold since 2017. He co-wrote, directed and starred in &quot;&quot; (2003), an independent film based on real events in the life of his friend Ryan Dunn. Dunn played himself as the main character while Margera played &quot;Valo&quot;, a character based on himself and elements of HIM singer and friend Ville Valo.

Margera also directed &quot;&quot;, formerly titled &quot;Kiss a Good Man&#x27;s Ass&quot;. The film is a loose sequel to &quot;Haggard&quot; and features the &quot;garbage juicer&quot; invention from that film. Filming started April 5, 2007. On an episode of &quot;Radio Bam&quot;, Margera said that they were trying to make the movie PG-13 rated, but with the amount of swearing and a shot of nudity, an R rating could not be avoided. The first viewing of the rough version of the film was on August 7, 2007, at Sikes Hall. The movie was released straight to DVD in December 2008.

Also in December 2008, Margera released a Christmas-themed movie, &quot;Bam Margera Presents: Where the#$&amp;% Is Santa?&quot;. The movie is about Bam and his friends going to the Arctic Circle in Finland on a quest to find Santa Claus. The film features Ville Valo from HIM, the Dudesons, Hanoi Rocks, and Mark the Bagger.

In January 2015, Margera announced that he had been working on an autobiographical documentary film which he hoped to premiere in the near future. The film will deal primarily with Margera&#x27;s life after the death of his close friend and co-star, Ryan Dunn, who died in a car crash in 2011. According to Margera the film has been three years in the making, and will give viewers a glimpse into his childhood, career and rise to fame, while focusing mainly on his recovery from the death of Dunn. Musician Brent Hinds of the band Mastodon will play Dunn in what has been described as &quot;dramatic fantasy interludes&quot; that ties the film together while also re-enacting what Margera considers his &quot;darkest moments&quot; after Dunn&#x27;s death. 

During a Facebook Q&amp;A on December 7, 2015, Margera stated that the name of the film would change from &quot;I Need Time to Stay Useless&quot; to &quot;Earth Rocker&quot; and that it would be released February 2016. In a 2017 episode of Vice&#x27;s &quot;Epicly Later&#x27;d&quot;, Margera stated that after working on the film for four years straight, sometimes for weeks at a time, he had reached the point where he had had enough of doing so. Margera stated that he had approximately eleven terabytes worth of video footage and that editing it down into a two-hour film was impossible. When asked if the project was on pause for the moment, he responded that it was.

As of 2024, the documentary remains unreleased, with no scheduled release date.

===&quot;Radio Bam&quot; and music===
Margera began a weekly Sirius Satellite Radio show on Sirius channel 28 Faction on November 24, 2004, called &quot;Radio Bam&quot;. The show initially featured Margera and his friends from the &quot;CKY&quot; and &quot;Jackass&quot; crews, while later shows featured less of the two crews and more of Margera&#x27;s newer friends. In 2005, Margera formed a music label, Filthy Note Records, and has since directed music videos for Clutch, Turbonegro, Viking Skull, Vains of Jenna and several for CKY. He also directed four music videos, &quot;Buried Alive by Love&quot;, &quot;The Sacrament&quot;, &quot;And Love Said No&quot;, and &quot;Solitary Man&quot;, for the Finnish band HIM, and three for The 69 Eyes, &quot;Lost Boys&quot;, &quot;Dead Girls Are Easy&quot; and &quot;Dead N Gone&quot;. 

A competent amateur musician, Margera also played keyboards in a novelty band called Gnarkill along with his brother Jess Margera, Brandon DiCamillo, Rich Vose and Matt Cole. The group released two albums, &quot;Gnarkill&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Gnarkill vs. Unkle Matt and the Shitbirdz&quot; in 2006. Margera also plays guitar, frequently seen doing so in episodes of &quot;Viva La Bam&quot;. 

Since 2013, he has featured in two musical projects; Fuckface Unstoppable, which was written about in 2013 on the &quot;Buddyhead&quot; website in an article questioning the seriousness of the band (&quot;a joke band(?)&quot;). The band featured Margera, Jess Margera, his then-partner Nikki Boyd, and Brandon Novak. Chad Ginsburg, of CKY, was the band&#x27;s guitarist before quitting. Matt Deis, also of CKY, performed with the band as well. The band released their debut album &quot;FFU&quot; in May 2014 through Artery Records. 

A second project, The Evesdroppers, featuring Bam, Jess, Nikki, Mike Nappi, and Chad I Ginsburg, released a self-titled album in September 2016 through Casual Madness.

===Other projects===
Margera has been animated as a character in the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; video game franchise, specifically &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot;, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot;, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot;, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2&quot;, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot;, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Project 8&quot; and &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Proving Ground&quot;. He also voiced a character in the video game &quot;&quot;. He made cameo appearances in the movies &quot;Grind&quot; and &quot;Destroying America.&quot;

In late September 2008, Margera opened a bar/theater called &quot;The Note&quot;, in his hometown of West Chester, Pennsylvania. Serious restrictions from West Chester Borough Council caused a multitude of issues for Margera and the bar, and The Note closed its doors in January 2014.

In late 2009, Margera released a book containing private writings and pictures titled &quot;Serious as Dog Dirt&quot;.

In 2020, Margera started appearing in YouTube videos including a viral water balloon fight video with model Jeb Carty.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
Margera was engaged to Jenn Rivell, who played a prominent part in several of his projects. The couple appeared to be cohabiting in various episodes of &quot;Viva La Bam&quot;. Their seven-year relationship ended in 2005. In November 2006, Margera filed for &quot;protection from abuse&quot; from Rivell after she allegedly broke into his house.

In 2006, Margera became engaged to childhood friend Melissa &quot;Missy&quot; Rothstein. The events leading up to their wedding (with about 350 friends and family in attendance) on February 3, 2007, in downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, were chronicled on the MTV series &quot;Bam&#x27;s Unholy Union&quot;. The couple&#x27;s honeymoon was in Dubai. In 2008, during an appearance on &quot;LA Ink&quot;, Margera told Kat Von D about $13,000 in damage that occurred during his wedding celebration, explaining, &quot;I was kind of ready for it, though. I was like, &#x27;I&#x27;m inviting the &quot;Jackass&quot; crew. If something doesn&#x27;t get broken then that&#x27;s not right.&#x27;&quot;
 In October 2010, Margera told Howard Stern that he and Rothstein were living in separate cities, they meet once a week, and that Rothstein knew that he had girlfriends. The couple divorced in November 2012.

On October 5, 2013, Margera married Nicole Boyd in Reykjavík, Iceland. In June 2017, Margera announced that Boyd was pregnant with the couple&#x27;s first child. In September 2017, it was announced that the child, a boy, would be named Phoenix Wolf. Margera&#x27;s son was born in December 2017. 

On September 16, 2021, Boyd filed for child custody of their son Phoenix Wolf. However, she did not file a divorce petition to end their eight-year marriage. On February 15, 2023, Boyd filed for legal separation and spousal support, citing irreconcilable differences. The couple has been living separately since 2021. Legal documents state that Boyd is seeking physical and legal custody and that Margera can have parental visitation as long as he and his son remain within Los Angeles County. It further details that her reasoning for filing for separation was based on Margera behaving inappropriately while spending time with their son, leading Boyd to believe Margera was under the influence.

He started dating model Dannii Marie in July 2023. He proposed to her in October 2023. They were officially married on May 28, 2024.

===Name and residence===
Margera owns two houses in the West Chester area – his present residence and his former home, known as Castle Bam, which he bought in 2004. Castle Bam is a large house in Pocopson Township, Pennsylvania, that was often featured on &quot;Viva La Bam&quot;. The house has a gothic theme, a skatepark in the driveway, and is situated on of land. In January 2007, Margera built a ramp in the backyard which caused trouble with the township. 

In 2018, April Margera began renovating the home in order for it to be used for short-term rentals via Airbnb. Margera has made it known that the home will not look the way it did on &quot;Viva La Bam&quot;. Rentals of the home were expected to be made available in 2018.

In an October 24, 2007, interview with the &quot;Cleveland Free Times&quot;, Margera stated that although he had completed paperwork that would legally change his first name to Bam, he was &quot;still debating&quot; filing it after a conversation with his father.

===Health and alcoholism ===
Margera has had a history of alcohol abuse since his early twenties, and was frequently seen drinking and/or intoxicated on-camera in &quot;Viva La Bam&quot;, &quot;Bam&#x27;s Unholy Union&quot;, and in behind-the-scenes footage from the &quot;Jackass&quot; films. In July 2009, Margera was taken to the hospital by paramedics and state troopers after a four-day alcohol binge. His drinking habits had worsened after his previous shows ended in 2007. In December 2009, he entered rehab for the first time after an intervention from his friends and family, but did not complete the program, leaving after only four days. Following close friend Ryan Dunn&#x27;s death in 2011, Margera&#x27;s drinking intensified further, and by Margera&#x27;s own account, he considers 2012 as the year he lost control of his drinking, both due to Dunn&#x27;s death, but also because bone spurs forced him to put his skating career on hold, and he began binge drinking &quot;to kill the boredom&quot;.

In 2015, Margera entered rehab for a second time for alcoholism, but again left shortly after without finishing the program. Later that year, he took part in &quot;Family Therapy with Dr. Jenn&quot; on VH1 with his mother, April Margera, after which he remained sober for several months. and revealed how his unhealthy lifestyle had forced him to relearn skating after five years, and had also left him overweight. He then moved to Tallinn, Estonia, for five months to get in better shape. After getting in better shape, he relocated to Barcelona, Spain, with his family to focus on his skating career in late 2016, but moved back to Pennsylvania in 2017, before his son was born. In a 90-minute interview with YouTube series &quot;The Nine Club&quot; recorded and released in November 2017, Margera discussed his health issues and alcoholism, claiming that he had been &quot;mostly sober&quot; since 2015.

In January 2018, Margera entered rehab for the third time after a DUI, and remained sober for seven months. Later that year, he relapsed after being robbed at gunpoint during a vacation in Colombia. In January 2019, one year after his previous attempt, Margera entered rehab once more, but left after ten days, stating that he &quot;didn&#x27;t belong there&quot;, and was planning on beating his alcoholism on his own. In March 2019, TMZ released a video showing Margera screaming at and threatening his manager at West Side Comedy Club in New York City. Additionally, Margera made Instagram posts in which he insulted his wife and damaged his own home, leading to friends and family members coming together to have Margera committed to a mental health treatment facility. Margera was released from treatment and returned home after one week.

On August 3, 2019, a drunken Margera was removed from a commercial airline flight following an altercation with an airport police officer, who told him he was too intoxicated to fly. The following day, Margera posted a chain of videos on his Instagram account, publicly pleading for Dr. Phil&#x27;s help. He directed a lengthy tirade towards his mother April, wife Nikki Margera, and childhood friend Brandon Novak, candidly stating his relationship with his family is broken. Dr. Phil responded to Margera&#x27;s pleas the next morning, referring him to a treatment center following a one-on-one session.

On May 17, 2022, Margera announced that he had completed one year of sobriety treatment. He relapsed less than a month later, and on June 15, Margera was reported missing after fleeing his rehab center. He was found and voluntarily returned to rehab after being gone for a week. He was returned with police escort since he was in the rehabilitation facility under court order. On June 26, 2022, he was reported missing again after fleeing his rehab center for the second time. He was found and checked in to a new treatment facility on June 27, 2022. He was spotted at a bar after fleeing rehab once again on September 4, 2022. On September 25, 2022, it was reported that he was caught intoxicated in a bar in Atlanta, Georgia, amid rehab problems. 

On December 9, 2022, it was reported that Margera was hospitalized and put on a ventilator in a San Diego ICU due to pneumonia and COVID-19. He was released from the hospital the next day. On &quot;Steve-O&#x27;s Wild Ride!&quot; podcast, he said that he also suffered from four seizures before he got to the hospital, and another one during his stay at the hospital.

On February 15, 2023, his wife Nikki filed for legal separation and spousal support, citing irreconcilable differences. Legal documents detailed that her reasoning for filing for separation was based on Margera behaving inappropriately while spending time with their son, leading Boyd to believe Margera was under the influence of alcohol.

On March 29, 2023, Margera was arrested for public intoxication.

On May 26, 2023, it was reported that Margera wants a judge to dismiss his divorce with his wife Nikki, as she is not allowing him to see their son. On June 1, 2023, he posted a video on Instagram threatening to smoke crack until he&#x27;s dead unless he sees his son. By June 4 police had located and taken custody of Margera in Los Angeles, California, after which he was involuntarily committed to a mental health facility for evaluation via a 5150 hold.

On September 23, 2024, it was reported that he was arrested again after he allegedly violated his probation. He was put in the Chester County Prison, and was ordered to undergo a drug and alcohol evaluation.

=== Legal issues ===
On June 12, 2010, Margera was allegedly attacked with a baseball bat outside his bar, The Note. Margera spent the night at Crozer-Chester Medical Center, where he was treated for head injuries. According to the alleged assailant, Elizabeth Ray, it was because Margera allegedly called her a &quot;nigger&quot;. Ray denies attacking Margera. Margera denies having said the word, claiming &quot;I called her a crazy bitch and an idiot, but I definitely didn&#x27;t use the n-word&quot;.

In July 2013, Margera was arrested at Keflavík Airport in Iceland, having left the country without paying damages following a rental car dispute the year before. Margera had rented a Toyota Land Cruiser during a vacation in Iceland in 2012, which he had returned in &quot;terrible shape&quot; five days later, but left the country before paying for the damage. Margera was released later the same day after paying the outstanding fees, and admitted in an interview that he had trashed the car in a drunken stupor.

On March 2, 2023, Margera was arrested for domestic violence, after he allegedly kicked a woman. He was released from custody after he posted a $50,000 bail the next day. On April 23, 2023, police were dispatched to Margera&#x27;s home after he allegedly made death threats to his brother and subsequently punched him in the face. Margera reportedly fled on foot into the woods when police arrived. After being on the run for three days and allegedly making several threatening phone calls to his family, Margera surrendered to Pennsylvania Police. He also released a statement saying the allegations made by his brother were false.

Around June 7, 2023, Margera was placed on 5150 psychiatric hold at a Los Angeles mental health facility, following disturbing text messages Margera had been sending family members, and erratic speech and behavior when he was located by police.

Additionally, Margera encountered further legal issues in Delaware County when he was arrested for public intoxication and disorderly conduct. Prosecutors questioned whether his bail should be revoked due to these incidents, prompting Margera to appear before Judge Patrick Carmody and pledge his commitment to sobriety. The judge allowed Margera to remove his ankle bracelet temporarily to assess his alcohol use, with a warning of consequences for any future violations.

==== &quot;Jackass&quot; firing ====
During a January 2021 interview, Margera revealed that owing to his behavior over the last few years, &quot;Jackass&quot; co-creator Jeff Tremaine had to fight with the studio to keep Margera in the next &quot;Jackass&quot; film, &quot;Jackass Forever&quot; (2022), and that Margera still was not certain that Paramount Pictures was ultimately going to allow him to partake in the filming of the movie, and that it depended on his sobriety and behaviour. On February 11, 2021, Margera posted several videos to his Instagram account, in which he admitted to breaking his sobriety, and indicated that he had officially been fired from the filming of &quot;Jackass Forever&quot;, which was officially confirmed soon after. Throughout the video, he could be seen crying, vomiting, and alluding to having looked up &quot;how to tie a noose&quot; before his move to Oceanside, California.

Margera alleged that Paramount had been forcing him to take antidepressants, submit to random urine tests, and to check in to two different rehabilitation facilities using his own money. He also expressed disdain for Tremaine, Johnny Knoxville, and Spike Jonze, before asking his fans to boycott &quot;Jackass Forever&quot;. He then solicited his followers to send him money to film his own movie to compete with &quot;Jackass Forever&quot;. The videos were removed from Margera&#x27;s Instagram account soon after being posted.

On May 25, 2021, it was reported that Tremaine had filed a temporary restraining order against Margera, due to Margera&#x27;s harassment of both Tremaine and Knoxville via Instagram. Tremaine was granted an additional three-year restraining order, extended to Tremaine&#x27;s wife and children, after Margera allegedly sent the family death threats. On August 9, 2021, Margera filed a lawsuit against Tremaine, Knoxville, and Jonze, as well as against Paramount Pictures, MTV, Dickhouse Entertainment, and Gorilla Flicks, alleging that he was wrongfully fired from the production of &quot;Jackass Forever&quot;. 

On January 12, 2022, Knoxville said that one scene Margera filmed for &quot;Jackass Forever&quot; would still be in the film, despite the ongoing lawsuit. They came with a settlement after Margera asked to dismiss the lawsuit on April 14, 2022. The terms of the settlement remain private. Margera eventually appeared in the film in one scene filmed before his termination and in archival footage. 

Following the settlement, Margera ruled out any future involvements with his former &quot;Jackass&quot; colleagues, stating Knoxville and Tremaine “ruined the legacy of &quot;Jackass&quot;”, although he remains friends with Steve-O.

<doc id="530572" wikidata="Q3409007" url="?curid=530572" title="Non-heart-beating donation">
<text>Prior to the introduction of brain death into law in the mid to late 1970s, all organ transplants from cadaveric donors came from non-heart-beating donors (NHBDs).

Donors after brain death (DBD) (beating heart cadavers), however, led to better results as the organs were perfused with oxygenated blood until the point of perfusion and cooling at organ retrieval, and so NHBDs were generally no longer used except in Japan, where brain death was not legally or culturally recognized, until very recently.

However, a growing discrepancy between demand for organs and their availability from DBDs has led to a re-examination of using non-heart-beating donations, DCD (Donation after Circulatory Death, or Donation after Cardiac Death), and many centres are now using such donations to expand their potential pool of organs.

Tissue donation (corneas, heart valves, skin, bone) has always been possible for NHBDs, and many centres now have established programmes for kidney transplants from such donors. A few centres have also moved into DCD liver and lung transplants. Many lessons have been learnt since the 1970s, and results from current DCDs transplants are comparable to transplants from DBDs.

==Maastricht classification==
Non-heart-beating donors are grouped by the Maastricht classification: developed at Maastricht in the Netherlands. in 1995 during the first International Workshop on Non-Heart‐Beating donors.
Categories I, II, IV and V are termed &quot;uncontrolled&quot; and category III is &quot;controlled&quot;.

As of yet, only tissues such as heart valves, skin and corneas can be taken from category I donors. Category II donors are patients who have had a witnessed cardiac arrest outside hospital, have cardiopulmonary resuscitation by CPR-trained providers commenced within 10 minutes but who cannot be successfully resuscitated. Category III donors are patients on intensive care units with nonsurvivable injuries who have treatment withdrawn; where such patients wished in life to be organ donors, the transplant team can attend at the time of treatment withdrawal and retrieve organs after cardiac arrest has occurred.

Maastricht definitions were reevaluated after the 6th International Conference in Organ Donation held in Paris in 2013 and a consensus agreement of an established expert European Working Group on the definitions and terminology were standardized, and later the word &quot;retrieved&quot; (organ) was substituted for &quot;recovered&quot; throughout the text.

==Organs that can be used==
Kidneys can be used from category II donors, and all organs except the heart can potentially be used from category III, IV and V donors. An unsuccessful kidney recipient can remain on dialysis, unlike recipients of some other organs, meaning that a failure will not result in death.

Kidneys from uncontrolled (category II) donors must be assessed with care as there is otherwise a high rate of failure. Many centres have protocols for formal viability assessment. Relatively few centres worldwide retrieve such kidneys, and leaders in this field include the transplant units in Maastricht (the Netherlands), Newcastle upon Tyne and Leicester (United Kingdom), Madrid and Barcelona (Spain), Pavia (Italy) and Washington, DC (United States).

Livers and lungs for transplant can only be taken from controlled donors, and are still somewhat experimental as they have only been performed successfully in relatively few centres. In the United Kingdom, NHBD liver transplants are currently performed in Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital Cambridge, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, King&#x27;s College Hospital London, St. James&#x27;s University Hospital, Leeds, Newcastle upon Tyne and the Scottish Liver Transplant Unit in Edinburgh. In other countries such as Spain, currently up to one-third of transplants are performed with NHBD. The International Meeting on Transplantation from Non-Heart-Beating Donors is organised in the UK every two years and brings together specialists in transplantation including transplant physicians, surgeons, fellows, nurses, coordinators, intensive care physicians, perfusion technicians, ethicists, and researchers interested in the aspects of retrieval, preservation and transplantation of DCD thoracic and abdominal organs and cells.

Lectures are held by experts on the most challenging themes such as clinical outcomes of transplantation of controlled and uncontrolled DCD organs, progress made on machine perfusion of kidneys, livers, lungs and hearts and ethics and legal issues regarding donation after cardiac death.

==Procedure for uncontrolled donors==
Following declaration of death, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is continued until the transplant team arrive. A &quot;stand-off&quot; period is observed after cessation of CPR to confirm that death has occurred; this is usually from 5 to 10 minutes in length and varies according to local protocols.

Once the stand-off period has elapsed, a cut down is performed over the femoral artery, and a double-balloon triple-lumen (DBTL) catheter is inserted into the femoral artery and passed into the aorta. The balloons are inflated to occlude the aorta above and below the renal arteries (any donor blood specimens required can be taken before the top balloon is inflated). A pre-flush with streptokinase or another thrombolytic is given through the catheter, followed by 20 litres of cold kidney perfusion fluid; the opening of the lumen is between the balloons so that most of the flush and perfusion fluid goes into the kidneys. Another catheter is inserted into the femoral vein to allow venting of the fluid.

Once full formal consent for organ donation has been obtained from relatives, and other necessary formalities such as identification of the deceased by the police and informing the Coroner (in the UK), the donor is taken to the operating room, and the kidneys and heart valves retrieved.

==Procedure for controlled donors==
If the liver or lungs are felt to be suitable for transplantation, then the donor is usually taken directly to the operating room after cardiac arrest, and a rapid retrieval operation is performed once a 10-minute stand-off period has elapsed. It seems this stand-off period has been reduced to as short as 75 seconds based on a recent article by the CBC. This is now causing an ethical debate as to whether physicians will declare death sooner than is currently required. This is similar to a normal multi-organ retrieval, but prioritises rapid cannulation, perfusion and cooling with ice, with dissection following later.

If only the kidneys are suitable for retrieval, either rapid retrieval or cannulation with DBTL catheter can be used. Use of a DBTL catheter allows relatives of the deceased to see them after death, but the donor must be taken to the operating room as soon as possible.

Category IV donors (who are already brain-stem dead), should either proceed as for a normal multi-organ retrieval—if this has already started—or should be managed as a category II or III as appropriate to the circumstances of cardiac arrest.

==Ethical issues==

Certain ethical issues are raised by NHBD transplantation such as administering drugs which do not benefit the donor, observance of the Dead-donor Rule, the decision-making surrounding resuscitation, the withdrawal of life-support, the respect for a dying patient and the dead body, as well as proper information for the family. In 2016 author Dale Gardiner issued a report called &quot;How the UK Overcame the Ethical, Legal and Professional Challenges in Donation After Circulatory Death&quot;.

==Actions prior to consent==

In category II uncontrolled donors, the donor may die and the transplant team arrive before the donor&#x27;s next-of-kin can be contacted. It is controversial whether cannulation and perfusion can be started in these circumstances. On one hand, it can be considered a violation of the potential donor&#x27;s autonomy to cannulate before their in-life wishes are known. On the other hand, delay in cannulation may mean that a patient&#x27;s strongly held wish to be donor cannot be respected. Many ethicists also feel that a doctor&#x27;s duty of care to the still living outweighs any duty of care to the dead. The compromise reached is usually to cannulate if there is any evidence of a wish to donate (such as a donor card or registration as a donor) even in the absence of next-of-kin.

For category III donors, treatment is being withdrawn from a living person, who will then die and become a donor. Important factors for assessment include A) that the decisions regarding nonsurvivable injuries are correct, B) continued treatment is futile and C) that withdrawal is in the patient&#x27;s best interests be made completely independently of any consideration of suitability as an organ donor. Only after such decisions have been firmly made should a patient be considered as a potential organ donor. Although such treatment can be continued until the transplant team arrives, no additional treatment should be started to improve the organs—until the point of death, the patient should be treated exactly as any other dying patient.

The standard recommendation to ensure this is to require a complete separation of the treatment and organ procurement teams. It is not, however, clear how complete this separation can be in those jurisdictions that require hospitals to report the names of candidates for organ donation to an Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) &quot;before&quot; life support has been withdrawn so that organ donation can be discussed with surrogates. This forces treating physicians to view their patients partly as potential organ donors, and even absent an OPO, it is unrealistic to think treating physicians are not aware of benefits to others of transplantation, and sometimes weigh this against the benefit of continued treatment to the patient. As one author puts it: &quot;If the person in need of organ transplantation is younger, more attractive, or in some way more deserving than another critically ill patient&quot;—and there are always such patients awaiting transplants—&quot;then the conclusion that one patient&#x27;s condition is hopeless can be tainted by an understanding of the tremendous hope organ availability holds for another.&quot;

Factored into this is the element of judgement that physicians bring to evaluating the &quot;best interest&quot; of patients. There is considerable variability among physicians in determining from whom to withdraw life-sustaining treatments in the ICU. Bias has been demonstrated on the part of medical professionals against patients who are perceived as disabled or are otherwise stigmatized. Studies have shown that, when evaluating the quality of life of severely disabled patients, physicians consistently apply much poorer rating than do the patients themselves. This raises the question: Would prejudice about vulnerable patients, such as disabled people, lead medical professionals to approach such individuals and families for NHBD more than others with higher &quot;quality of life&quot; ratings? Thus, as Doig puts it: &quot;…the possibility of conflicted decision-making in a controlled DCD program is more than a theoretical possibility.&quot; The upshot is that the mere existence of a NHBD program in a hospital potentially compromises the care of patients. Few have rejected those programs on this basis, but the question of how to protect against it is ongoing.

==Dead donor rule==
The so-called &quot;dead donor rule&quot; (DDR) requires that persons be dead before their organs can be taken, and this rule is basic to all DCD programs. Also common to all DCD programs is that death is determined by cardiocirculatory criteria according to which life-support is withdrawn, an interval of the monitored absence of pulse, blood pressure, and respiration observed, and then death declared. Programs differ, however, on the length of the interval. The Pittsburgh Protocol requires 2 minutes, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and Canadian Council for Donation and Transplantation (CCDT) 5 minutes, the 1981 President&#x27;s Commission 10 minutes, and recently Boucek et al. have proposed that it can be shortened to 75 seconds.

These times are based on estimates of when autoresuscitation (i.e., the spontaneous recovery of circulatory activity) becomes impossible. The scientific validity of all these times, however, has been questioned. The IOM in 2000 concluded that &quot;existing empirical data cannot confirm or disprove a specific interval at which the cessation of cardiopulmonary function becomes irreversible.&quot; In addition, none of these intervals precludes the possibility of CPR restoring cardiocirculatory activity. To preclude that, brain death is required. The exact interval at which that occurs is likewise not known, but it is known to be more than 10 minutes.
In light of this we can now raise the question of whether patients declared dead by cardiocirculatory criteria are really dead. It is generally agreed that death occurs when the patient is in an irreversible state. Whether patients declared dead by cardiocirculatory criteria are really dead thus depends on what is meant by &quot;irreversible,&quot; and the term is open to a stronger and weaker interpretation.

On the stronger interpretation &quot;irreversibility&quot; means that spontaneous cardiocirculation &quot;cannot be restored no matter what intervention is done, including CPR.&quot; On the weaker interpretation it means that spontaneous cardiocirculation &quot;cannot be restored because CPR efforts have been refused by the patient (as a DNR order in an advance directive), by a surrogate decision-maker or by the medical team because it is not medically indicated.&quot; Thus the person need not be in a physically irreversible state, but only in a morally or legally irreversible state.

On the weaker interpretation, persons declared dead by DCD cardiocirculatory criteria cannot be known to be dead, as it is not always physically impossible to restore circulation by vigorous CPR. The weaker interpretation, however, does allow persons declared dead by DCD criteria to be counted as dead. It is often objected that this interpretation does not accord with the everyday meaning of death. Ordinarily we do not think that persons are dead when we have reasons not to revive them, but only when they cannot physically be revived. Nonetheless, declaring persons dead for purposes of transplantation by DCD criteria is &quot;accepted medical practice&quot; in many parts of the world, and where it is (as in Canada, for example) the legal standard for declaring death is met.

The upshot is that we cannot straightforwardly say whether DCD violates the DDR. Whether it does or not depends on whether we think this requires that people be dead in the ordinary sense of the word or in a legal or some other understanding of it, and writers are lined up on both sides of this issue.

==Pain and suffering==
Controlled DCD may involve interventions such as vessel cannulation before life-sustaining therapy is withdrawn and death is declared, and may also involve post-mortem interventions such as in situ preservation. Uncontrolled DCD may additionally involve chest compressions and mechanical ventilation both before and after consent for DCD is obtained and typically requires the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. We know that all of these interventions cause distress to conscious patients who are not taking palliative medications. Thus, because patients who are candidates for DCD are not known to be brain dead either before or shortly after they are declared dead by cardiocirculatory criteria, the possibility that they may experience distress must be considered.

There are three approaches that have been taken to this possibility of pain and suffering: (1) provide palliative medications where there are physical signs compatible with distress; (2) withhold all such medications on the ground that even if signs of distress are occurring, the patient does not have sufficient cognition to interpret any sensations as noxious; or (3) provide palliative medications prophylactically to prevent any possible distress. Whichever approach is adopted, worries have been expressed over whether patients can be guaranteed not to experience any distress. Re: (1) providing medication only on signs compatible with distress does not prevent the possibility of distress. Re: (2), since patients declared dead by cardiocirculatory criteria cannot be known to be brain dead, dismissing signs compatible with distress as not being distress again does not prevent the possibility of distress. Re: (3) physicians may inappropriately withhold sufficient sedative or analgesic medication to avoid the appearance of euthanasia or in order to improve organ viability.

There is also the question of whether DCD patients receive compromised end of life (EOL) care. The President&#x27;s Council for Bioethics has warned that DCD can transform EOL care from a &quot;peaceful dignified death&quot; into a profanely &quot;high-tech death&quot; experience for donors and donor&#x27;s families. ICUs are not typically set up to provide optimum palliative care. The process of obtaining donation consent and subsequent donor management protocols for DCD deviate from some of the quality indicators recommended for optimal EOL care. Organ-focused behaviour by professionals requesting consent for organ donation and ambivalent decision making by family members increase the risk of relatives of deceased donors subsequently developing traumatic memories and stress disorders. The processes required for the successful accomplishment of donation consent and subsequent organ recovery can interfere with many of the interventions that lessen the burden of bereavement of relatives of ICU decedents.

==Informed consent==
The standard consent for DCD goes like this. Patients or families are told that they will have a chance to say their goodbyes, the patient will then be taken to the operating room, life support will be removed, and after 2–10 minutes of continuously observed absence of pulse, blood pressure, and respiration, death will be declared and the removal of organs begin. Consent to this is taken to be consent to organ donation at death determined by cardiocirculatory criteria, i.e., to DCD. The problem is that death is commonly understood as an irreversible state in the strong sense. The commonsense understanding of death is that it is a permanent state, and that if a person has truly died then life cannot be restored to the individual. Death understood as an irreversible state in the weak sense—as one that will not be, or ought not to be, or cannot legally or morally be reversed—is on this view a revisionist account of how death can be best conceived rather than an accurate descriptive account of how it actually is commonly understood. Given this, when donors consent to donation at death they can only be presumed to be consenting to organ donation when their loved one is in a physically irreversible state. Since, however, death determined by cardiocirculatory criteria is not necessarily a physically irreversible state, consent to organ donation at death is not consent to organ donation at death determined by cardiocirculatory criteria.

Menikoff criticizes the IOM for not routinely disclosing to prospective donors and families that and how death determined by cardiocirculatory criteria differs from death in the ordinary sense. In particular, he faults the IOM for not telling them that donors will be declared dead before brain death is known to have occurred, and hence they may have their organs removed when portions of the brain (including the higher brain) are still functional. Potts et al. on behalf of the IOM reply that informed consent does not require this level of disclosure: &quot;Reviewing with interested family members that all brain activity may not have ceased at the exact moment that death is pronounced may be appropriate in some circumstances, but, for many families confronted with such overwhelming emotional matters, knowledge that death has been pronounced is what is paramount. The sensitivity and skill of the physicians and nurses to the individual needs of families is the key factor whether or not organ donation is involved.&quot;

Behind this disagreement on what disclosure is required is a larger one that Brock has characterized as a choice between &quot;truth or consequences&quot;. In Brock&#x27;s view, public policy cannot centre in on the unqualified and unconstrained search for the truth without concern for the consequences of that search. On some occasions &quot;the likely effects on the well-being and rights of the public of exposing the full complexity, ambiguity, uncertainty, and controversy surrounding a particular public policy could be sufficiently adverse and serious to justify not exposing them and presenting the issue in misleading or oversimplified terms instead.&quot; Brock concludes that &quot;No general answer can be given to truth-or-consequences choices that will hold for all cases. In any particular instance of this choice, we must instead weigh the policy gains against the moral and political risks, and how that balances out will often be empirically uncertain and morally controversial.&quot;

On the issue at hand, Menikoff and Brock think that the importance of informed consent should put us on the &quot;truth&quot; side of the question. Menikoff writes: &quot;Deceiving prospective organ donors about relevant truths concerning their condition is likely, ultimately, to lead to diminished public confidence and to fewer organ donations. But even if it did not reduce the number of donated organs, in a system that is allegedly based on freely given consent, we must recognize that obtaining such consent by telling less than the truth is fundamentally wrong.&quot; And Brock contends that in a democratic state there is a presumption that the citizens will be informed about all relevant information of public policy, and thinks that DCD involves such a radical change in the timing of death from what people ordinarily think, that it is something that they should be informed about. By contrast, the IOM took itself to have the task of addressing the question: &quot;Given a potential donor in an end-of-life situation, what are the alternative medical approaches that can be used to maximize the availability of organs from that donor without violating prevailing ethical norms regarding the rights and welfare of donors?&quot; And it replied: &quot;Our goal was to support both the interests of patients and families regarding nature and time of death and the public&#x27;s interests in increased organ procurement. In striking the balance, the expert panel strictly adhered to widely endorsed principles of ethics and established legal and legal guidelines.&quot; In thus balancing what is disclosed to the family against what is in the interest of organ procurement, the IOM comes down on the &quot;consequences&quot; side of the &quot;truth or consequences&quot; debate.

==DCD and the future==
DCD is a procedure that operates in an area set by two rules. The first is the DDR, which says that no vital organs can be taken before the patient is dead. The second, a corollary of this, prohibits killing patients by or for organ procurement.

It is not, however, always clear how procedures that are beneficial to transplantation can be fit under those rules. For example, providing ECMO (Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation) to donors immediately after death is declared by cardiocirculatory criteria can keep organs in their freshest possible condition. If, however, ECMO provides circulation and oxygenation to the entire body, can the donor really be declared dead by those criteria? The rules can also generate other puzzle cases. If a donor is declared dead by cardiocirculatory criteria, can the heart be transplanted, or does the fact that the heart is started in another negate the determination of death in the first?

Further such problems are bound to arise in the future. To handle them Bernat recommends that a committee be set up: &quot;A consensus-driven oversight process should determine whether investigational protocols reflect appropriate medical treatment and whether their translation into accepted clinical practice is sound public policy. Leaders of the critical care, neurology, and transplantation communities need to jointly draft practice guidelines for organ donation after circulatory death that establish acceptable boundaries of practice. These boundaries should be based on scientific data and accepted principles and should be demarcated conservatively to maintain public confidence in the integrity of the transplantation enterprise.&quot;

Others, however, argue that rather than having to either provide answers to these problems that square with the rules in question or forgo advantageous procedures, it would be best to reject those rules. Instead of making the question &quot;When is the patient dead?&quot; the central question to trigger organ retrieval, the proposal is to shift the focus to obtaining valid consent from patients or surrogates and the principle of nonmaleficence. As Truog explains the proposal: &quot;On this view, policies could be changed such that organ procurement would be permitted only with the consent of the donor or appropriate surrogate and only when doing so would not harm the donor. Individuals who could not be harmed by the procedure would include those who are permanently and irreversibly unconscious (patients in a persistent vegetative state or newborns with anencephaly) and those who are imminently and irreversibly dying. Qualified individuals who had given their consent could simply have their organs removed under general anesthesia without first undergoing an orchestrated withdrawal of life support. Anencephalic newborns whose parents requested organ donation could likewise have the organs removed under general anesthesia without the need to wait for the diagnosis of brain death.&quot;

This approach has conceptual and pragmatic advantages. On the conceptual side, securing organs at optimum times does not require us to constantly redefine death and when it occurs so that persons who are alive may have their organs taken. It would also allow us to say that when a physician removes life-support and the patient dies that the physician caused patient&#x27;s death. Many think this is more natural than saying that all the physician did was to return the patient to an untreated disease state and that state caused the death. Finally, we thereby avoid the proliferation of definitions of death with differing times in different jurisdictions, different definitions of death for different purposes (the cardiocirculatory definition of death discussed in this article is only valid for DCD), and arbitrary rulings such as declaring anencephalic infants with heartbeat dead.

On the pragmatic side, rejecting the rules in question would have advantages for recipients and donors in transplant programs. Because there will now be no necessary interval between pulselessness and the declaration of death, there can be a reduction in warm ischemia time, and so an improvement in the quality and quantity of transplantable organs. It will also be possible to give the donor drugs such as heparin and phentolamine, which can hasten death but also maximize organ preservation. Finally, it will eliminate the possibility that patients will experience discomfort as they are withdrawn from ventilator support by allowing potentially fatal doses of morphine that are not titrated to signs of distress.

The main obstacle to accepting the proposal is securing the acceptance of the public to allow physicians to cause the death of (which is to say kill) patients to obtain transplantable organs. Proponents of the proposal contend that robust consent requirements can provide the public with the assurance against exploitation that the dead donor rule and the prohibition on killing are designed to provide. Others deny this. Thus the question can be posed: &quot;Given the difficulties our society is likely to experience in trying to openly adjudicate these disparate views [of accepting or rejecting the prohibition on physicians killing for transplantation], why not simply go along with the quieter strategy of policy creep? It seems to be getting us where we want to go, albeit slowly. Besides, total candor is not always compatible with public policy (Calabresi G and Bobbitt P. &quot;Tragic Choices&quot;. New York: Norton,1978).&quot; The debate continues unresolved.

<text>In an English-speaking country, Standard English (SE) is the variety of English that has undergone codification to the point of being socially perceived as the standard language, associated with formal schooling, language assessment, and official print publications, such as public service announcements and newspapers of record, etc. All linguistic features are subject to the effects of standardisation, including morphology, phonology, syntax, lexicon, register, discourse markers, pragmatics, as well as written features such as spelling conventions, punctuation, capitalisation and abbreviation practices. SE is local to nowhere: its grammatical and lexical components are no longer regionally marked, although many of them originated in different, non-adjacent dialects, and it has very little of the variation found in spoken or earlier written varieties of English. According to Peter Trudgill, Standard English is a social dialect pre-eminently used in writing that is distinguishable from other English dialects largely by a small group of grammatical &quot;idiosyncrasies&quot;, such as irregular reflexive pronouns and an &quot;unusual&quot; present-tense verb morphology.

The term &quot;Standard&quot; refers to the regularisation of the grammar, spelling, usages of the language and not to minimal desirability or interchangeability (e.g., a standard measure). For example, there are substantial differences among the language varieties that countries of the Anglosphere identify as &quot;standard English&quot;: in England and Wales, the term &quot;Standard English&quot; identifies Proper English, the Received Pronunciation accent, and the grammar and vocabulary of United Kingdom Standard English (UKSE); in Scotland, the variety is Scottish English; in the United States, the General American variety is the spoken standard; and in Australia, the standard English is General Australian. By virtue of a phenomenon sociolinguists call &quot;elaboration of function&quot;, specific linguistic features attributed to a standardised dialect become associated with nonlinguistic social markers of prestige (like wealth or education). The standardised dialect itself, in other words, is not linguistically superior to other dialects of English used by an Anglophone society.

Unlike with some other standard languages, there is no national academy or international academy with ultimate authority to codify Standard English; its codification is thus only by widespread prescriptive consensus. The codification is therefore not exhaustive or unanimous, but it is extensive and well-documented.

== Definitions ==
Although standard English is usually associated with official communications and settings, it is diverse in registers (stylistic levels), such as those for journalism (print, television, internet) and for academic publishing (monographs, academic papers, internet). This diversity in registers also exists between the spoken and the written forms of SE, which are characterised by degrees of formality; therefore, Standard English is distinct from formal English, because it features stylistic variations, ranging from casual to formal. Furthermore, the usage codes of nonstandard dialects (vernacular language) are less stabilised than the codifications of Standard English, and thus more readily accept and integrate new vocabulary and grammatical forms. Functionally, the national varieties of SE are characterised by generally accepted rules, often grammars established by linguistic prescription in the 18th century.

English originated in England during the Anglo-Saxon period, and is now spoken as a first or second language in many countries of the world, many of which have developed one or more &quot;national standards&quot; (though this does not refer to published standards documents, but to the frequency of consistent usage). English is the first language of the majority of the population in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas and Barbados and is an official language in many others, including India, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa and Nigeria; each country has a standard English with a grammar, spelling and pronunciation particular to the local culture.

As the result of colonisation and historical migrations of English-speaking populations, and the predominant use of English as the international language of trade and commerce (a &quot;lingua franca&quot;), English has also become the most widely used second language. Countries in which English is neither indigenous nor widely spoken as an additional language may import a variety of English via instructional materials (typically British English or American English) and consider it &quot;standard&quot; for teaching and assessment purposes. Typically, British English is taught as standard across Europe, the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia, and American English is taught as standard across Latin America and East Asia. This does, however, vary between regions and individual teachers. In some areas a pidgin or creole language blends English with one or more native languages.

== Grammar ==

Although the standard Englishes of the anglophone countries are similar, there are minor grammatical differences and divergences of vocabulary among the varieties. In American and Australian English, for example, &quot;sunk&quot; and &quot;shrunk&quot; as past-tense forms of &quot;sink&quot; and &quot;shrink&quot; are acceptable as standard forms, whereas standard British English retains only the past-tense forms of &quot;sank&quot; and &quot;shrank&quot;. In Afrikaner South African English, the deletion of verbal complements is becoming common. This phenomenon sees the objects of transitive verbs being omitted: &quot;Did you get?&quot;, &quot;You can put in the box&quot;. This kind of construction is infrequent in most other standardised varieties of English.

== Origins ==
In the past, different scholars have meant different things by the phrase &#x27;Standard English&#x27;, when describing its emergence in medieval and early modern England. In the nineteenth century, it tended to be used in relation to the wordstock. Nineteenth-century scholars Earle and Kington-Oliphant conceived of the standardisation of English in terms of ratios of Romance to Germanic vocabulary. Earle claimed that the works of the poets Gower and Chaucer, for instance, were written in what he called &#x27;standard language&#x27; because of their amounts of French-derived vocabulary.

Subsequently, attention shifted to the regional distribution of phonemes. Morsbach, Heuser and Ekwall conceived of standardisation largely as relating to sound-change, especially as indicated by spellings for vowels in stressed syllables, with a lesser emphasis on morphology.

Mid-twentieth-century scholars McIntosh and Samuels continued to focus on the distribution of spelling practice but as primary artefacts, which are not necessarily evidence of underlying articulatory reality. Their work led to the publication of the &quot;Linguistic Atlas of Late Mediaeval English,&quot; which aims to describe dialectal variation in Middle English between 1350 and 1450. The final date was chosen to reflect the increasing standardisation of written English. Although as they note, &quot;The dialects of the spoken language did not die out, but those of the written language did&quot;.

A number of late-twentieth-century scholars tracked morphemes as they standardised, such as auxiliary &quot;do&quot;, third-person present-tense &quot;-s&quot;, &quot;you/thou&quot;, the &quot;wh-&quot; pronouns, and single negation, multiple negations being common in Old and Middle English and remaining so in spoken regional varieties of English.

=== Present-day investigations ===
In the twenty-first century, scholars consider all of the above and more, including the rate of standardisation across different text-types such as administrative documents; the role of the individual in spreading standardisation; the influence of multilingual and mixed-language writing; the influence of the Book of Common Prayer; standardisation of the wordstock; evolution of technical registers; standardisation of morphemes; standardisation of letter-graphs, and the partial standardisation of Older Scots.

=== Late West Saxon ===
After the unification of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms by Alfred the Great and his successors, the West Saxon variety of Old English began to influence writing practices in other parts of England. The first variety of English to be called a &quot;standard literary language&quot; was the West Saxon variety of Old English.

However, Lucia Kornexl defines the classification of Late West Saxon Standard as rather constituting a set of orthographic norms than a standardised dialect, as there was no such thing as standardisation of Old English in the modern sense: Old English did not standardise in terms of reduction of variation, reduction of regional variation, selection of word-stock, standardisation of morphology or syntax, or use of one dialect for all written purposes everywhere.

The Norman Conquest of 1066 decreased the usage of Old English, but it was still used in parts of the country for at least another century.

=== Mixed language ===
Following the changes brought about by the Norman Conquest of 1066, England became a trilingual society. Literate people wrote in Medieval Latin and Anglo-Norman French more than they wrote in monolingual English. In addition, a widely used system developed which mixed several languages together, typically with Medieval Latin as the grammatical basis, adding in nouns, noun-modifiers, compound-nouns, verb-stems and -&quot;ing&quot; forms from Anglo-Norman French and Middle English. This mixing of the three in a grammatically regular system is known to modern scholars as &quot;mixed-language&quot;, and it became the later fourteenth and fifteenth-century norm for accounts, inventories, testaments and personal journals.

The mixed-language system was abandoned over the fifteenth century, and at different times in different places, it became replaced by monolingual supralocal English, although it was not always a straightforward exchange. For example, Alcolado-Carnicero surveyed the London Mercers&#x27; Livery Company Wardens&#x27; Accounts and found that they switched back and forth for over seventy years between 1390 and 1464 before finally committing to monolingual English.

Individual scribes spent whole careers in the mixed-language stage, with no knowledge that monolingual English would be the eventual outcome and that it was in fact a stage of transition. For much of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, writing in mixed-language was the professional norm in money-related text types, providing a conduit for the borrowing of Anglo-Norman vocabulary into English.

=== Middle English ===
From the 1370s, monolingual Middle English was used increasingly, mainly for local communication. Up until the later fifteenth century, it was characterised by great regional and spelling variation. After the middle of the fifteenth century, supralocal monolingual varieties of English began to evolve for numerous pragmatic functions.

Supralocalisation is where &quot;dialect features with a limited geographical distribution are replaced by features with a wider distribution&quot;.

Over the later fifteenth century, individuals began to restrict their spelling ratios, selecting fewer variants.

However, each scribe made individual selections so that the pool of possible variants per feature still remained wide at the turn of the sixteenth century.

Thus, the early stage of standardisation can be identified by the reduction of grammatical and orthographical variants and loss of geographically marked variants in the writing of individuals.

=== Demise of Anglo-Norman ===
The rise of written monolingual English was due to the abandonment of Anglo-Norman French between 1375 and 1425, with subsequent absorption into supralocal varieties of English of much of its wordstock and many of its written conventions. Some of these conventions were to last, such as minimal spelling variation, and some were not, such as digraph and trigraph .

Anglo-Norman was the variety of French that was widely used by the educated classes in late medieval England. It was used, for example, as the teaching language in grammar schools. For example, the Benedictine monk Ranulph Higden, who wrote the widely copied historical chronicle &quot;Polychronicon&quot;, remarks that, against the practice of other nations, English children learn Latin grammar in French. Ingham analysed how Anglo-Norman syntax and morphology written in Britain began to differ from Anglo-Norman syntax and morphology written on the Continent from the 1370s onwards until the language fell out of use in Britain in the 1430s.

After the last quarter of the fourteenth century Anglo-Norman written in England displayed the kind of grammatical levelling which occurs as the result of language acquired in adulthood, and deduces that the use of Anglo-Norman in England as a spoken vehicle for teaching in childhood must have ceased around the end of the fourteenth century. An examination of 7,070 Hampshire administrative (episcopal, municipal, manorial) documents written 1399–1525 showed that Anglo-Norman ceased to be used after 1425.

The pragmatic function for which Anglo-Norman had been used – largely administering money – became replaced by monolingual English or Latin. Anglo-Norman was abandoned towards the end of the fourteenth century, though the consequent absorption of many of its written features into written English paralled the socio-economic improvement of the poorer, monolingually English-speaking classes over that century.

=== Supralocal varieties ===
When monolingual English replaced Anglo-Norman French, it took over its pragmatic functions too. A survey of the Middle English Local Documents corpus, containing 2,017 texts from 766 different locations around England written 1399–1525, found that language choice was conditioned by the readership or audience: if the text was aimed at professionals, then the text was written in Latin; if it was aimed at non-professionals, then the text was written in Anglo-Norman until the mid-fifteenth century and either Latin or English thereafter. More oral, less predictable texts were aimed at non-professionals as correspondence, ordinances, oaths, conditions of obligation, and occasional leases and sales.

The supralocal varieties of English which replaced Anglo-Norman in the late fifteenth century were still regional, but less so than fourteenth-century Middle English had been, particularly with regard to morphemes, closed-class words and spelling sequences. As some examples: less regionally-marked features &quot;urban-hopped&quot; in texts from Cheshire and Staffordshire (&quot;urban-hopping&quot; refers to texts copied in cities being more standardised than those copied in smaller towns and villages, which contained more local dialect features); a lower frequency of regionally-marked spellings were found in wills from urban York versus those from rural Swaledale; and texts from Cambridge were less regionally marked than those from the surrounding Midlands and East Anglian areas.

However, these late fifteenth- and sixteenth-century supralocal varieties of English were not yet standardised. Medieval Latin, Anglo-Norman and mixed-language set a precedent model, as Latin and French had long been conventionalised on the page and their range of variation was limited. Supralocal varieties of English took on this uniformity by reducing more regionally-marked features and permitting only one or two minor variants.

=== Transition to Standard English ===
Later fifteenth- and sixteenth-century supralocalisation was facilitated by increased trade networks.

As people in cities and towns increasingly did business with each other, words, morphemes and spelling-sequences were transferred around the country by means of speaker-contact, writer-contact and the repeat back-and-forth encounters inherent in trading activity, from places of greater density to those of lower. Communities of practice such as accountants auditing income and outgoings, merchants keeping track of wares and payments, and lawyers writing letters on behalf of clients, led to the development of specific writing conventions for specific spheres of activity. English letter-writers 1424–1474 in one community of practice (estate administrators) reduced spelling variation in words of Romance origin but not in words of English origin, reflecting the pragmatics of law and administration, which had previously been the domain of Anglo-Norman and mixed-language.

This shows that the reduction of variation in supralocal varieties of English was due to the influence of Anglo-Norman and mixed-language: when English took over their pragmatic roles, it also took on their quality of spelling uniformity. Members of the gentry and professionals, in contradistinction to the nobility and lower commoners, were the main users of French suffixes in a survey of the Parsed Corpus of Early English Correspondence, 1410–1681.

This finding that the middling classes uptook French elements into English first is in keeping with estate administrators&#x27; reduction of spelling variation in words of French origin: in both cases, the literate professional classes ported Anglo-Norman writing conventions into their English.

Standard English was not to settle into its present form until the early nineteenth century. It contains elements from different geographical regions, &quot;an urban amalgam drawing on non-adjacent dialects&quot;.

Examples of multiregional morphemes are auxiliary &quot;do&quot; from south-western dialects and third-person present tense &quot;-s&quot; and plural &quot;are&quot; from northern ones. An example of multiregional spelling is provided by the reflex of Old English /y(:)/ – Old English /y(:)/ was written as in the north and north-east Midlands, in the south and south-west Midlands, and in the south-east and south-east Midlands. Standard English retains multiregional spellings such as &quot;cudgel&quot; (Old English ), &quot;bridge&quot; (Old English ), &quot;merry&quot; (Old English ).

Unlike earlier twentieth-century histories of standardisation , it is no longer felt necessary to posit unevidenced migrations of peoples to account for movement of words, morphemes and spelling conventions from the provinces into Standard English. Such multiregionalisms in Standard English are explained by the fifteenth-century countrywide expansion of business, trade and commerce, with linguistic elements passed around communities of practice and along weak-tie trade networks, both orally and in writing.

== Superseded explanations ==

Although the following hypotheses have now been superseded, they still prevail in literature aimed at students. However more recent handbook accounts such as those of Ursula Schaeffer and Joan C. Beal explain that they are insufficient.

=== A. East Midlands ===
Bror Eilert Ekwall hypothesised that Standard English developed from the language of upper-class East Midland merchants who influenced speakers in the City of London.

By &quot;language&quot;, Ekwall stipulated just certain graphs and letter-graphs in stressed syllables, present plural suffix &quot;-e(n&quot;, present participle suffix &quot;-ing&quot;, and pronoun &quot;they&quot;, which he thought could not be East Saxon and so must be from eastern Anglian territory. He, therefore, examined locative surnames in order to discover whether people bearing names originating from settlements in the East Midlands (in which he included East Anglia) migrated to London between the Norman Conquest of 1066 and 1360. By this method, he found that most Londoners who bore surnames from elsewhere indicated an origin in London&#x27;s hinterland, not from East Anglia or the East Midlands. Nevertheless, he hypothesised that East Midlands upper-class speakers did affect the speech of the upper classes in London. He thought that upper-class speech would have been influential, although he also suggested influence from the Danelaw in general. Thus his dataset was very limited, by &#x27;standard&#x27; he meant a few spellings and morphemes rather than a dialect per se, his data did not support migration from the East Midlands, and he made unsupported assumptions about the influence of the speech of the upper classes (details in Laura Wright 2020).

=== B. Central Midlands ===
Michael Louis Samuels criticised Ekwall&#x27;s East Midlands hypothesis.

He shifted Ekwall&#x27;s hypothesis from the East to the Central Midlands, he classified late medieval London and other texts into Types I-IV, and he introduced the label &#x27;&quot;Chancery Standard&#x27;&quot; to describe writing from the King&#x27;s Office of Chancery, which he claimed was the precursor of Standard English. Samuels did not question Ekwall&#x27;s original assumption that there must have been a migration from somewhere north of London to account for certain graphs and letter-graphs in stressed syllables, present plural suffix &quot;-e(n&quot;, present participle suffix &quot;-ing&quot;, and pronoun &quot;they&quot; in fifteenth-century London texts, but his work for the &quot;Linguistic Atlas of Late Mediaeval English&quot; did not support the possibility of an East Anglian or East Midland migration, and he replaced it by hypothesising a migration of people from the Central Midlands, although without historical evidence. Like Ekwall, Samuels was not dogmatic and presented his work as preliminary.

=== C. Types I-IV ===
Samuels classified fifteenth century manuscripts into four Types.

These divisions have subsequently proved problematical, partly because Samuels did not specify exactly which manuscripts fall into which class, and partly because other scholars do not see inherent cohesiveness within each Type. Matti Peikola examining Type 1, (&#x27;Central Midland Standard&#x27;) spelling ratios in the orthography of 68 hands who wrote manuscripts of the Later Version of the Wycliffite Bible, concluded: &quot;it is difficult to sustain a &#x27;grand unifying theory&#x27; about Central Midland Standard&quot;.

Jacob Thaisen analysing the orthography of texts forming Type 2 found no consistent similarities between different scribes&#x27; spelling choices and no obvious overlap of selection signalling incipient standardisation, concluding &quot;it is time to lay the types to rest&quot;.

Simon Horobin examining spelling in Type 3 texts reported &quot;such variation warns us against viewing these types of London English as discrete … we must view Samuels&#x27; typology as a linguistic continuum rather than as a series of discrete linguistic varieties&quot;.

=== D. Chancery Standard ===
Samuels&#x27;s Type IV, dating after 1435, was labelled by Samuels &#x27;Chancery Standard&#x27; because it was supposedly the dialect in which letters from the King&#x27;s Office of Chancery supposedly emanated.

John H. Fisher and his collaborators asserted that the orthography of a selection of documents including Signet Letters of Henry V, copies of petitions sent to the Court of Chancery, and indentures now kept in The National Archives, constituted what he called &quot;Chancery English&quot;. This orthographical practice was supposedly created by the government of Henry V, and was supposedly the precursor of Standard English. However, this assertion attracted strong objections, such as those made by Norman Davis, T. Haskett, R. J. Watts, and Reiko Takeda. Takeda points out that &quot;the language of the documents displays much variation and it is not clear from the collection what exactly &#x27;Chancery English&#x27; is, linguistically&quot; (for a critique of Fisher&#x27;s assertions, see Takeda.) For a critique of Fisher&#x27;s philological work, see Michael Benskin 2004, who calls his scholarship &quot;uninformed not only philologically but historically&quot;.

Gwilym Dodd has shown that most letters written by scribes from the Office of Chancery were in Medieval Latin and that petitions to the Crown shifted from Anglo-Norman French before to monolingual English around the middle of the century. Scribes working for the Crown wrote in Latin, but scribes working for individuals petitioning the king – it is likely that individuals engaged professionals to write on their behalf, but who these scribes were is not usually known – wrote in French before the first third of the fifteenth century, and after that date in English. As with mixed-language writing, there followed decades of switching back and forth before the Crown committed to writing in monolingual English so that the first English royal letter of 1417 did not signal a wholesale switchover.

Latin was still the dominant language in the second half of the fifteenth century. As Merja Stenroos put it, &quot;the main change was the reduction in the use of French, and the long-term development was towards more Latin, not less. On the whole, the output of government documents in English continued to be small compared to Latin.&quot;

== Spelling ==

With rare exceptions, Standard Englishes use either American or British spelling systems, or a mixture of the two (such as in Australian English and Canadian English). British spellings usually dominate in Commonwealth countries.

<text>Mustafa Ali Zabri (; 1938 – 27 August 2001), better known by his kunya Abu Ali Mustafa (; ) and also known as Mustafa Alhaj, was a Palestinian militant who served as the General Secretary of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) from July 2000 until he was assassinated by Israeli forces in a targeted killing on 27 August 2001. Mustafa was succeeded as Secretary General by Ahmad Saadat, and the PFLP subsequently renamed their armed wing in the Palestinian territories the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades.

==Biography==
Mustafa Zabri was born in 1938, in the northern West Bank town of Arrabah, the son of a farmer. In 1955 he joined the Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM), and two years later was arrested by the Jordanian authorities for his political activities. On his release in 1961, he took charge of the ANM&#x27;s military operations in the northern West Bank. Following the Israel Defense Forces&#x27; capture of the West Bank in the Six-Day War, he left the West Bank and spent 32 years mainly in Damascus and Jordan.

Mustafa joined George Habash and other left-wing members of the ANM in establishing the Marxist–Leninist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in 1967, and became a leading member of the new organization. He was also a prominent member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, rising to become a member of its ruling Executive Committee. He was for a long time deputy to Habash&#x27;s leadership of the PFLP.

In September 1999 he returned to the West Bank under a deal struck between Yasser Arafat and Israel&#x27;s Prime Minister, Ehud Barak. In July 2000 he was elected as the new general secretary of the PFLP after Habash retired. The PFLP is designated a terrorist organization by Israel and many western states. Israel held Mustafa personally responsible for 10 different car-bomb attacks undertaken by the PFLP during his time as general secretary (in Jerusalem, Or Yehuda, Yehud, and Haifa) and other shootings.

== Assassination ==
Mustafa was killed by two rockets fired from two Israeli Apache helicopters through his two office windows, as he sat at his desk in his office in Al-Bireh city, in a targeted killing on 27 August 2001.

Thousands of mourners attended his funeral. Associated Press said, &quot;Marching in the Ramallah funeral procession were the leaders of Palestinian factions that have been riven by rivalries in the past&quot;. The mourners included ministers from Yasser Arafat&#x27;s Cabinet, other members of the Palestinian legislature, and high-ranking representatives of radical groups including Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

In an interview with Al Jazeera shortly before his death, Mustafa repeated his belief that the Palestinian people have the right to struggle using all means, including the armed struggle. Asked about the risk of targeted killing at Israeli hands he said: &quot;We all are targeted as soon as we begin to be mobilised. We do our best to avoid their guns, but we are living under the brutal Zionist occupation of our lands, and its army is only a few metres away from us. Of course we must be cautious, but we have work to do, and nothing will stop us.&quot; He also rejected anything less than Israel&#x27;s &quot;destruction&quot;, saying &quot;we do not make deals or truces with Israel.&quot;

Israeli tourist minister Rehavam Ze&#x27;evi, leader of the far-right nationalist Moledet party, was subsequently assassinated on 17 October 2001 by PFLP member Hamdi Quran in revenge for Israel&#x27;s killing of Mustafa&#x27;s. Ze&#x27;evi had been a strong supporter of Israel carrying out targeted killing of Palestinian militants. He and his party also supported the ethnic cleansing of the Occupied Palestinian Territories, by under the euphemism &quot;population transfer&quot;.

<text>Witch&#x27;s broom or witches&#x27; broom is a deformity in a woody plant, typically a tree, where the natural structure of the plant is changed. A dense mass of shoots grows from a single point, with the resulting structure resembling a broom or a bird&#x27;s nest. It is sometimes caused by pathogens.

Diseases with symptoms of witches&#x27; broom, caused by phytoplasmas or basidiomycetes, are economically important in a number of crop plants, including the cocoa tree &quot;Theobroma cacao&quot;, jujube (&quot;Ziziphus jujuba&quot;) and the timber tree &quot;Melia azedarach&quot;.

==Causes==
A tree&#x27;s characteristic shape, or habit, is in part the product of auxins, hormones which control the growth of secondary apices. The growth of an offshoot is limited by the auxin, while that of the parent branch is not. In cases of witch&#x27;s broom, the normal hierarchy of buds is interrupted, and apices grow indiscriminately. This can be caused by cytokinin, a phytohormone which interferes with growth regulation. The phenomenon can also be caused by other organisms, including fungi, oomycetes, insects, mites, nematodes, phytoplasmas, and viruses. The broom growths may last for many years, typically for the life of the host plant. If twigs of witch&#x27;s brooms are grafted onto normal rootstocks, freak trees result, showing that the attacking organism has changed the inherited growth pattern of the twigs.

==Ecological role==
Witches&#x27; brooms provide nesting habitat for birds and mammals, such as the northern flying squirrel, which nests in them.

<doc id="530593" wikidata="Q3482609" url="?curid=530593" title="Shriekback">
<text>Shriekback are an English rock band formed in 1981 in Kentish Town by Barry Andrews, formerly of XTC and the League of Gentlemen (keyboards/synthesizers/vocals), and Dave Allen, formerly of Gang of Four (bass guitar), with Carl Marsh, formerly of Out on Blue Six (guitars/vocals) soon added to the line-up. The band&#x27;s early music was a funk-influenced version of new wave and post-punk, later moving towards art rock and always featuring &quot;insidiously weird vocals&quot;.

==History==
The band enjoyed some success on the dance chart on its original Y Records label and had a string of hits on the UK Indie Chart, while its first album, &quot;Care&quot; (1983), was picked up by Warner in the United States. The band left Y for Arista Records for &quot;Jam Science&quot; (1984), also recruiting the drummer Martyn Barker. The album reached number 85 on the UK Albums Chart and &quot;Hand on my Heart&quot; was a number 52 UK single. The 1985 album &quot;Oil and Gold&quot; was recorded on Arista (released by Island Records in the US). Marsh left Shriekback during the recording of &quot;Oil and Gold&quot; and was replaced on guitar by Mike Cozzi, with Andrews taking over lead vocals. Shriekback also left Arista and signed to Island Records for whom they recorded &quot;Big Night Music&quot; (1986), after which Allen left to rejoin Gang of Four, and Shriekback remained a collaborative centred on Andrews. Allen also went on to play in King Swamp and The Elastic Purejoy. Marsh was also in the band Happyhead.

After another album in 1988, &quot;Go Bang!&quot;, the band split up. Andrews continued working on other projects before re-forming Shriekback in 1992, although after the single &quot;The Bastard Sons of Enoch&quot; and album &quot;Sacred City&quot;, there were no further releases until &quot;Naked Apes and Pond Life&quot; (2000). Both Allen and Marsh returned to the studio to contribute to the recording of the 2003 release &quot;Having a Moment&quot;. After &quot;Having a Moment&quot;, Andrews recorded three albums for Malicious Damage (Killing Joke&#x27;s original label) under the Shriekback name.

Shriekback are still actively producing music and released the studio album, &quot;Why Anything? Why This?&quot;, in May 2018. The same line-up of Andrews, Barker and Marsh self-released a 15th studio album, &quot;Some Kinds of Light&quot;, on 6 December 2019. &quot;1000 Books&quot; and &quot;Bowlahoola&quot; followed in 2021 and 2022.

==Members==
Other than those listed above, Shriekback members or contributors have included Luc van Acker, Linda Nevill, Emma Burnham, Brian Nevill, Pedro Ortiz, Clare Hirst, Lu Edmonds, Wendy and Sarah Partridge (from Electric Guitars), Steve Halliwell, Eve Moon, Ivan Julian, Mike Cozzi and Jessica Palin/Jose Fina Cupido.

==In other media==
The film director Michael Mann was a fan of the band and used several Shriekback songs in his films &quot;Manhunter&quot; and &quot;Band of the Hand&quot; and in his television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. Music composed by Shriekback is used as the theme song for the &quot;Squaring the Strange&quot; podcast hosted by Benjamin Radford and Pascual Romero. They selected it because of their fondness for music from the 1980s.

<text>St Margarets is an affluent suburb and neighbourhood in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, about west-southwest of central London. It is bounded by the Thames Tideway to the north-east, and the River Crane to the north-west and north where the land tapers between those rivers. Land and buildings closer to Richmond Bridge than the eponymous railway station are, traditionally distinctly, known as East Twickenham. Both places go by their post town and traditional parish, Twickenham quite often; in the 19th century the south of St Margarets was marked on maps as Twickenham Park.

The area hosts a house that J. M. W. Turner saw built during his painting career and St Margarets railway station is within of Marble Hill House.

Uniquely in London among the few places prefixed &quot;Saint&quot; it is named after a house. Specifically it is named after a large house together with appurtenant land of an 18th-century Scottish-New Jerseyan aristocrat, rather than a church which began in 1930.

==History==

The place hosted, in the south-east, remnants of the site of an encampment of the barons and their men in 1261. This refers to a minor civil war of the last three weeks of June or so – a power struggle between the crown (ministry of Henry III of England) and the aristocracy, a few uprisings later cemented into constitutional change led by de Montford. The net result of the uprisings was a settled parliamentary system enabling limits to the monarch&#x27;s powers to tax and departure from such edicts as the Provisions of Oxford and Westminster.

 takes its name from the former Saint Margaret&#x27;s House, the second guise of which stood from 1827 to 1853. It was the country house of Archibald Kennedy, 1st Marquess of Ailsa (12th Earl of Cassilis), and for a few final decades became the home of the Earl of Kilmorey. Their names can be found in such streets as Kilmorey Gardens and Ailsa Road.

Victorian and Edwardian houses dominate the housing stock. In 1854 the St Margaret&#x27;s Estate was laid out for building family houses, becoming one of the first garden suburbs.

Today&#x27;s developed suburb dates from the arrival of the railway. The new railway station was preliminarily &quot;Ailsa Crossing&quot; as it passed through the estate, but it became &quot;St Margarets&quot; before opening.

A memorial was unveiled in April 2017 to the 6000 Belgian refugees many of the adults of whom lived and worked locally during the First World War. It is on the west bank of the Thames at Warren Gardens, next to the site of the Pelabon Munitions Works.

==Annual events==
St Margarets Fair is held each July in Moormead Park by the River Crane, a channel from its larger stream, on the western limits.

==Buildings==

In 1814 the painter J. M. W. Turner had built Solus Lodge in Sandycoombe Road. The house survives as Sandycombe Lodge.

&quot;Gordon House&quot; is a Grade II-listed Georgian mansion on the river Thames at St Margarets. Like St Margaret&#x27;s House it was owned by Lord Kilmorey. The house has a Robert Adam wing, added in 1738. For many years, it was used as part of Brunel University. In recent years the house has been redeveloped by Octagon Developments, with the former chapel and coachhouse converted to private homes.

The Kilmorey Mausoleum has been moved several times, and is now on the northern edge of St Margarets. It was built in the 1850s by the 2nd Earl of Kilmorey and contains the bodies of the Earl and his mistress, Priscilla Anne Hoste. Now a Grade II* listed building, it was built to resemble an ancient Egyptian monument. It is jointly maintained by Richmond upon Thames Council and English Heritage. The mausoleum is occasionally open to the public.

The Roman Catholic Church of St Margaret of Scotland on St Margarets Road was built to a modern design of the architect Austin Winckley and opened in 1969. In 1999 it became a Grade II listed building. Its forerunner stood on site from 1938, after the relevant mission begun in an adjoining house in 1930. Twickenham and Isleworth as broad encompassing areas have had no other churches named after the saint.

In Anglicanism, two late-19th-century-founded Anglican church parishes serve the area. The place represents the north-west third of Saint Stephen&#x27;s and the eastern two-fifths of All Souls, if the Crane is taken as the northern limit.

== Education==

There are three main schools nearby, in Twickenham: Orleans Park School (secondary), St. Stephen&#x27;s Primary School (primary) and Orleans Primary School (primary).

==Local commerce and townscape==
Two main streets have a range of shops, cafés and bars/pubs serving food. Twickenham Studios are at the heart of the village and have recently announced plans to expand their presence in St Margarets.

The high street has well-frequented local, independent businesses.

Most roads are residential, some of which tree-lined. The most common house type is semi-detached; some detached, mainly those of three or four storeys have been subdivided. To the east of the &quot;village&quot; is the relatively verdant-setting houses and many classical flats (apartment buildings) of Twickenham Park.

==Neighbouring areas==
Direct neighbours comprise: 
*East Twickenham/Cambridge Park to the south-east.
*Richmond across the river to the east (accessible across Twickenham Bridge, Richmond Bridge and Richmond Lock Footbridge)
*Twickenham from the west through to the south. 
*Old Isleworth and the Ivybridge estate, Isleworth is to the north and northwest in the adjoining London Borough of Hounslow.

Between Richmond Lock and Kew Bridge is the first reach of the Thames proceeding upstream out of Central London with green, wooded expanses on both sides: Kew Gardens, associated golf course, and Syon Park which are all lightly wooded.

Marble Hill House and Marble Hill Park are immediately to the south.

==Transport==
===Road===
In modern station-centric terms St Margarets is quite narrowly cut through, as to about , by the busy Chertsey Road (A316), which connects central London to the M3 motorway. Much of south St Margarets is in a controlled parking zone (CPZ), which restricts parking to residents and holders of vouchers.

===Rail===
The normal service from St Margarets station is four stopping-service trains per hour to and from Waterloo. Both Richmond and Twickenham stations are a short bus journey from most parts of the suburb and have status as major stops on the transport network – meaning semi-fast and somewhat fast services call at those stations.

===Bus===
Two bus routes run through St Margarets: the 110 (Hounslow – Hammersmith) and the H37 (Hounslow – Richmond). Other nearby bus routes are 33, R68, R70 and 490 coming from central Twickenham along Richmond Road; all of these, except 33, go past Richmond station.

<text>Charles Frédéric Gerhardt (21 August 1816 – 19 August 1856) was a French chemist, born in Alsace and active in Paris, Montpellier, and his native Strasbourg.

==Biography==
He was born in Strasbourg, which is where he attended the gymnasium (an advanced academic secondary school). He then studied at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where Friedrich Walchner&#x27;s lectures first stimulated his interest in chemistry. Next he attended the school of commerce in Leipzig, where he studied chemistry under Otto Linné Erdmann, who further developed his interest into a passion for questions of speculative chemistry.

Returning home in 1834, he entered his father&#x27;s white lead factory, but soon found that business was not to his liking, and after a sharp disagreement with his father in his 20th year he enlisted in a cavalry regiment. In a few months military life became equally distasteful, and he purchased his discharge with the assistance of the German chemist Justus von Liebig. After a short period of living in Dresden, he went to the University of Giessen in central Germany in 1836 to study and work in Liebig&#x27;s laboratory. His stay at Giessen lasted 18 months, and in 1837 he re-entered the factory. Again, however, he quarrelled with his father, and in 1838 he went to Paris with introductions from Liebig.

In Paris, he attended Jean Baptiste Dumas’ lectures and worked with Auguste Cahours (1813–1891) on essential oils, especially cumin, in Michel Eugène Chevreul’s laboratory at the Jardin des Plantes, meanwhile earning a precarious living by teaching and making translations of some of Liebig’s writings. In 1841, through the influence of Dumas, he was charged with the duties of chemistry professor at the Montpellier faculty of sciences, becoming titular professor in 1844.

In 1842 he annoyed his friends in Paris by the matter and manner of a paper on the classification of organic compounds. Later, he published &quot;Précis de chimie organique&quot; (1844–1845). In 1845 he and his opinions were the subject of an attack by Liebig, unjustifiable in its personalities but not altogether surprising in view of his wayward disregard of his patron’s advice. The two were reconciled in 1850, but his faculty for disagreeing with his friends did not make it easier for him to get another appointment after resigning the chair at Montpellier in 1851, especially as he was unwilling to go into the provinces.

He obtained leave of absence from Montpellier in 1848 so that he could pursue without interruption his special investigations, and from that year until 1855 he resided in Paris. During that period he established an &quot;École de chimie pratique&quot; (&quot;School for practical chemistry&quot;) for which he had great hopes. However, these hopes were disappointed, and in 1855, after refusing the offer of a chair of chemistry at the new Zürich Polytechnic in 1854, he accepted the professorships of chemistry at the Faculty of Sciences and the École Polytechnique at Strassburg, where he died the following year, having just completed checking the proofs for the final volume of his &quot;Traité de chimie organique&quot; (4 vols., Paris, 1853–56), his magnum opus. This latter work embodies all his ideas and his discoveries.

==Work==

Gerhardt is known for his work on reforming the notation for chemical formulas (1843–1846). He also worked on acid anhydrides, and synthesized acetylsalicylic acid, albeit in an unstable and impure form.

Gerhardt is usually linked with his contemporary, Auguste Laurent, with whom he shared a strong and influential interest in theories of chemical combination.

The rare mineral gerhardtite is named after him.

==Death==
He died on August 19, 1856, two days short of his 40th birthday, of a sudden fever.

<text>Jajce () is a town and municipality in the Central Bosnia Canton of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to the 2013 census, the town has a population of 7,172 inhabitants, with 27,258 inhabitants in the municipality, It is situated in the region of Bosanska Krajina, on the crossroads between Banja Luka, Mrkonjić Grad and Donji Vakuf, on the confluence of the rivers Pliva and Vrbas.

==History==
===Ancient times===

Jajce Mithraeum is a temple dedicated to the God of the Sun, Mithra. The god was worshiped and the cult spread to other parts of the Roman Empire throughout the Mediterranean basin by slaves and merchants from the Orient, and by Roman soldiers who came into contact with the followers of the cult in the East. The temple is dated to the 2nd century AD and was renovated sometime during the 4th century AD. This particular Mithraeum is renowned as one of the best preserved in Europe. It was discovered accidentally during the construction of a private house. The temple is protected by glass walls so that visitors can see inside even without entering the facility. However, for entry and a closer look, visitors need to give notice of their visit in advance by contacting the Ethnological Museum of Jajce.

The Jajce Mithraeum has been declared a National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

===Bosnian Kingdom===

Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, at the height of his power, founded the town of Jajce, and built a fortress on the site of an earlier fort. It is assumed that one of the locations of his death could be Jajce, where he built his tomb, known as the Catacombs of Jajce. However, another location of his burial is possibly believed to be Zgošća near Kakanj, where the Zgošća Stećak, a burial megalith, had been found.
Jajce was first built in the 14th century and served as the capital of the independent Kingdom of Bosnia during its time. The first references to the name of Jajce in written sources is from the year 1396, but the fortress already existed before this. The town has gates as fortifications, as well as a castle with walls which lead to the various gates around the town. About 10–20 kilometres from Jajce lies the Komotin Castle and town area which is older but smaller than Jajce. It is believed the town of Jajce was established after Komotin was struck by the Black Death.

===Banate of Jajce===

Jajce was the final residence of the last Bosnian king Stjepan Tomašević where he received the royal crown from Pope Pius II as &quot;by grace of God, the King of Serbs, Bosnia, Littoral, Hum, Dalmatia, Croats, etc.&quot;. The king was slain in the town after the Ottoman conquests.

The Ottomans besieged the town and executed Tomašević in 1463, but held it only for six months. What was left of the Kingdom of Bosnia was annexed by the Kingdom of Hungary, who looked to seize the opportunity to hinder the Ottoman expansion in the Balkans. With the Bosnian King&#x27;s death, an opportunity arose for the Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus to try and capture Bosnia before the Ottomans, which consequentially lead to the Siege of Jajce and suppression of the Ottoman forces&#x27; advancement. This derailed Ottoman plans for nearly half a century.

Later in the year 1463, king Matthias Corvinus established the .

Before her death in 1478 Queen Catherine restored the Saint Mary&#x27;s Church in Jajce, nowadays the oldest church in the town.

Skenderbeg Mihajlović besieged Jajce again in 1501, which, although the siege was unsuccessful, marked the approaching demise of the town and the Hungarian rule in Bosnia. Mihajlović was repelled by Ivaniš Korvin, who was assisted by the Zrinski, Frankopan, Karlović and Cubor families.in 1520 Petar Keglević became the Ban of Jajce.

====Jajce inscription====
In 1866, a Glagolitic inscription was discovered on the road from Jajce to Brod with the text &quot;ⰂⰀ ⰂⰓⰋⰮⰅ ⰖⰈⰮⰑⰆⰐⰑⰃ ⰍⰐⰅⰈⰀ ⰗⰅⰓⰅⰐⰜⰀ ⰁⰅⰓⰋⰔⰀⰎⰋⰛⰀ&quot;, &quot;In the time of knez Ferenac Berisalić&quot;, referring to Doborski/Grabarski of the Berislavić family of Grabarje, who was Ban of Jajce on multiple occasions around the turn of the 16th century. Its discovery was first published in 1885 by or possibly earlier, but was little known except to historians of that family such as Josip Koprivčević, because Jajce was so far away from where most Glagolitic inscriptions were made. It has appeared in several lists of Glagolitic inscriptions, but the inscription itself is thought to have be lost.

===Ottoman period===
In 1527, Jajce fell to the Ottomans. Under the Ottomans, the town lost its strategic importance, as the border moved further north.

There are several churches and mosques built at different times during different reigns, making Jajce a rather diverse town in this aspect.

===Austria-Hungary period===
Jajce was ruled together with the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the administration of Austria-Hungary from 1878 to 1918. The Franciscan monastery of Saint Luke was completed in 1885.

===World War II===

From 1929–1941, Jajce was part of the Vrbas Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. 
During the Second World War, Jajce gained importance as centre of a large swath of free territory, and on 29 November 1943 it hosted the second convention of the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ). There, representatives from throughout Yugoslavia decided to establish a federal Yugoslavia, one that would have equality between its ethnic groups, and established that Bosnia and Herzegovina would be one of its constitutive republics. The post-war economy of Jajce in socialist times was based on industry and tourism.

===Bosnian War===
At the beginning of the Bosnian War, Jajce was inhabited by people from all ethnic groups, and was situated at a junction between areas of the Bosnian Serb majority to the north, Bosniak majority areas to the southeast and Bosnian Croat majority areas to the southwest.

At the end of April and the beginning of May 1992, almost all ethnic Serbs fled or were expelled to the territory under Republika Srpska control. In the summer of 1992, the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) started heavy bombardment of the town. Jajce was defended by Croat (HVO) and Bosniak (ARBiH) forces with two separate command lines, but fell to Serb forces on 29 October. Retreating forces were joined by a column of 30,000 to 40,000 civilian refugees, stretching towards Travnik, under VRS sniping and shelling. Shrader defined it as &quot;the largest and most wretched single exodus&quot; of the Bosnian War.

Bosniak refugees resettled in Central Bosnia, while Croats moved either to Croatia or closer to the Croatian border due to rising tensions. By November 1992 the pre-war population of Jajce had shrunk from 45,000 to just several thousand.

In the following weeks, all mosques and Catholic churches in Jajce were demolished. It is presumed that the Orthodox church was demolished on 10–11 October by members of the so-called &quot;Krajina Brigade&quot; within the Army of BiH. The VRS converted the town&#x27;s Franciscan monastery into a prison and its archives, museum collections and artworks were looted; the monastery church was completely destroyed. By 1992, all religious buildings in Jajce had been destroyed, except for two mosques whose perilous positioning on a hilltop had made them unsuitable for demolition.

Jajce was re-captured together with Bosanski Petrovac in mid-September 1995 during Operation Mistral 2 by the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), after VRS forces had evacuated the Serb population. Jajce became part of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina according to the Dayton Agreement. Returning Bosniaks were at first blocked by a mob of Croats in early August 1996, which according to US diplomat Robert Gelbard was personally led by convicted Bosnian Croat war criminal Dario Kordić. Bosniak refugees were able to return peacefully only a few weeks after, being accompanied by many more. Dario Kordić surrendered and was flown to the Hague following political pressure on Zagreb, particularly by the United States.

A significant number of Serb refugees settled in Brčko while the rest settled in Mrkonjić Grad, Šipovo, and Banja Luka.

== Economy and tourism ==
=== National Monument and UNESCO Tentative List ===
The economy of the Jajce municipality is nowadays weak. UNESCO, with a Swedish organisation &quot;Kulturarv utan gränser&quot; (), initiated a project of the renovation of the historical core of the town. The main project of the company was to renovate old traditional houses which symbolize the panoramic view of the town with the waterfall. As of 2006, most of the houses were rebuilt.

The old Jajce walled city core, including the waterfall, and other individual sites outside the walled city perimeter, such as the Jajce Mithraeum, is designated as &quot;The Natural and Architectural Ensemble of Jajce&quot; and proposed for the inscription into the UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Site list. The bid for the inscription is currently placed on the UNESCO Tentative list.

===Tourism===
Jajce was a popular tourist destination in Yugoslav times, mostly due to the historical importance of the AVNOJ session. Tourism has restarted, and its numbers (20-55,000 tourists in 2012–2013) are relevant in relation to the municipality&#x27;s population (25,000). Tourists from across the former Yugoslavia still make up most of the visitors to Jajce, but Middle Eastern tourists have also increased since the early 2000s. Organised school trips also make up a significant portion of tourists. Spring and autumn are the main tourist seasons.

The town is famous for its beautiful high waterfall where the Pliva River meets the river Vrbas. It was damaged during the Bosnian War by high waters and severe flooding, as the area of the Jajce-1 Hydroelectric Power Station was at the battlefront and out of service; the sudden rise in water levels and discharge created a tidal wave which damaged the travertine body of the waterfall.

Jajce is situated in the mountains; there is beautiful countryside near the town, rivers such as the Vrbas and Pliva, and lakes such as Pliva lake, which is also a popular destination for the local people and tourists. Not far from Jajce there are mountains that are over 2,000 metres high, such as Vlašić near the town of Travnik. Travelling through the mountain roads to the town may not be pleasant for some visitors, because the roads are in poor condition, but the scenery is picturesque.
==Demographics==
In 1931 the municipality of Jajce was part of the much bigger Jajce County (together with today&#x27;s municipalities of Jezero, Dobretići and Šipovo).

266 Serbs from Jajce are documented to have been murdered at the Jasenovac concentration camp during World War II.

<text>Whitecross is an American Christian metal band from Illinois, formed in 1985 by singer Scott Wenzel and guitarist Rex Carroll, and re-formed in 2000. The band won three Dove Awards in the 1990s.

==History==
Whitecross formed in 1985 in Waukegan, Illinois, releasing their first recording in 1987. Their early albums, which often invite comparisons to Ratt, are laced with fast, technical guitar work. In 1994, Rex Carroll split with lead vocalist Scott Wenzel. Wenzel retained the name &quot;Whitecross&quot; while Carroll went on to form King James with Jimi Bennett (see below). At this point, the band&#x27;s sound underwent a drastic change.

Whitecross has won three Dove Awards with &quot;Triumphant Return&quot; (in 1990) and &quot;In the Kingdom&quot; (in 1992) winning &quot;Metal Album of the Year&quot; and &quot;Come unto the Light&quot; from the &quot;Unveiled&quot; album winning &quot;Hard Music Recorded Song of the Year&quot; at the 25th GMA Dove Awards in 1994.

In 1994 before work starting on the &quot;Unveiled&quot; album, guitarist Rex Carroll left to form the band King James and pursue other musical ventures. In 1998, singer Scott Wenzel took a two-year break to do mission work in Paraguay, South America. During this time, Whitecross went on hiatus before re-emerging at Cornerstone Festival in 2000 when Carroll and Wenzel re-formed the band with Carroll, Wenzel, Michael Feighan, and newcomer Benny Ramos providing bass, keyboards, and vocals. Finally having achieved a long-sought lineup stability, the band started performing regularly.

In 2005, the band went back into the studio to record &quot;Nineteen Eighty Seven&quot;, which featured re-recordings of nine of the ten songs from the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album (&quot;You&#x27;re Mine&quot; being the exclusion), as well as a re-recording of the song &quot;Love on the Line&quot; (previously unavailable on CD) and a new guitar instrumental by Rex Carroll.

On April 5, 2008, they played at the Legends of Rock festival in Ennepetal, Germany. Beginning in July 2008, they played the first of several short tours in Guatemala featuring shows in Guatemala City, Panajachel, Huehuetenango, and other cities. 

In 2017, Carroll and Feighan joined with David Bach and Jamie Rowe of Guardian to record &quot;Revival&quot;, a new compilation of Whitecross and Guardian tracks, and went on a short tour to promote the project.

<text>Viscount Harcourt, of Stanton Harcourt in the County of Oxford, was a title created twice for members of the Harcourt family, once in the Peerage of Great Britain and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

It was first created in the Peerage of Great Britain for Lord Chancellor Simon Harcourt, who was created Baron Harcourt in 1711, Viscount Harcourt in 1721, and Earl Harcourt and Viscount Nuneham in 1749. For more information on these titles, which all became extinct in 1830, see Earl Harcourt.
The viscountcy was revived in 1917 in favour of Lewis Vernon Harcourt,
 also created Baron Nuneham, of Nuneham Courtenay in the County of Oxford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Harcourt was the son of Sir William Vernon Harcourt, son of William Vernon Harcourt, son of the Honourable and Right Reverend Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt, son of George Venables-Vernon, 1st Baron Vernon, by his third wife, Martha Harcourt, daughter of Simon Harcourt, son of Simon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt.

After the death of the first viscount in 1922, the second viscount succeeded his father while still a student at Eton College. He married twice but left no sons; the title became extinct upon his own death in 1979.

<doc id="530619" wikidata="Q15054996" url="?curid=530619" title="John Robert Dunn">
<text>John Robert Dunn (1834 – 5 August 1895) was a South African settler, hunter, and diplomat of British descent. Born in Port Alfred in 1834, he spent his childhood in Port Natal/Durban. He was orphaned as a teenager, and lived in native dress on the land near the Tugela River. His conversance with Zulu customs and language allowed his increasing influence among Zulu princes.

He was able to identify and exploit various opportunities for trade. He represented both colonial and Zulu interests, and rose to some influence and power when King Cetshwayo became the Zulu sovereign. He acted as Cetshwayo&#x27;s secretary and diplomatic adviser and was rewarded with chieftainship, land, livestock and two Zulu virgins. 

In the run-up to the Zulu War, he was served with an ultimatum by the British at the same time as Cetshwayo. He had to forgo any position of neutrality and sided with the British. In the aftermath, he was allocated land in a buffer zone between the colony and Zululand. Besides his first wife Catherine, he took many Zulu women as wives and left a large Christian progeny when he died at age 60 or 61.

==Early life==
Dunn was born in Port Alfred in 1834. He was the son of Robert Newton Dunn. Resident of Port Elizabeth, Robert Dunn was one of the early settlers at Port Natal. On his mother&#x27;s side, he was the grandson of Alexander Biggar. Robert Dunn worked as a trader, owned land at Sea View and became wealthy trading hides and ivory.

Dunn lost his parents early. When he was 14, his father was trampled to death by an elephant. His mother Anne died three years later. He started to earn a living by working for transport riders and hunters. His love of hunting and his skill with a rifle took him across the Tugela River into Zululand on a regular basis, where he became fluent in the language and was befriended by local chiefs.

In 1853, after a failure of payment for a transport to the Transvaal, due to being not of age and the lack of a contract, he wandered disillusioned around Zululand. Here he eventually met the Natal agent Captain Joshua Walmsley and returned to Natal with him, acting as his interpreter until 1856.

==Cetshwayo==
In 1856, Zulu prince Mbuyasi, outnumbered by his brother Cetshwayo&#x27;s forces, had requested help from Walmsley, which was refused. Dunn was sent instead to negotiate peace terms between the two warring Zulu brothers, which failed. With a small force of Native Police, Dunn supported the Zulu king Mpande&#x27;s son Mbuyasi in the bloody battle of succession fought between him and the king&#x27;s oldest son Cetshwayo. On 2 December 1856, at the Battle of Ndondakusuka, Mbuyazi&#x27;s forces lost and he was killed, forcing Dunn and other white settlers to flee back to Natal. 

After the battle, Cetshwayo then clashed with two English traders and took 1,000 head of cattle. His involvement in the battle led to resentment towards Dunn by the white settlers of Natal, so on his own account he re-crossed the Tugela to ask the winner, Cetshwayo, to return the cattle that had belonged to the traders. Cetshwayo agreed, and requested that Dunn become his advisor in matters related to the British. The cattle were returned. He resigned his position in Natal and settled in Zululand in June/July 1857 and was allocated land on the coast of southern Zululand at oNgoya.

With use of his land, Zulu marriages and the loaning of cattle, Dunn built a network of clients and contacts along the Zululand coast that allowed him to exploit the region&#x27;s wealth. During the 1860s, he was involved in the trade of firearms into Zululand with the exchange of cattle for rifles via Lourenço Marques along the Zululand coast, as well as the flow of Tsonga workers to Natal for the agricultural industry, from the former. He would later be appointed as Protector of Immigrants for Zululand in 1874 by Theophilus Shepstone. Another important business income for Dunn was hunting. Organising his Zulu subjects as hunters, guides and porters, they successfully hunted for ivory, hides and skins, but by 1880, game had become scarce in Zululand.

On 18 October 1872, King Mpande died at the age of 74 and Cetshwayo became king. Dunn&#x27;s power and influence rose; he handled nearly all of Cetshwayo&#x27;s foreign correspondence. Though Mpande and Cetshwayo had successfully resisted attempts by the Boers and the British to encroach on their territory, the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879 forced John Dunn to pick sides, and he sided with the British.

==Anglo-Zulu War and its aftermath==
On 11 January 1879, British troops crossed the Tugela, near Fort Pearson, to present Cetshwayo with an ultimatum that amongst other things, included the disbandment of the Zulu Army and the age-group system within twenty days, which he could not and would not accept. Dunn accompanied the Zulu &quot;Indunas&quot; to Fort Pearson to receive Bulwer&#x27;s ultimatum for Cetshwayo. Fearing for his life, he did not deliver the ultimatum to Cetshwayo and retired to Emangete, wanting to remain neutral in the conflict between the British and the Zulu. 

So began the Anglo-Zulu War. He was persuaded to take part on the British side by Lord Chelmsford and was in charge of the Intelligence Department. He and his scouts provided excellent service to the British forces and took part in the Battle of Gingindlovu and in the relief of Eshowe. After the Zulu&#x27;s early success at the Battle of Isandlwana where they soundly defeated the British, they were themselves defeated at the Battle of Ulundi, which resulted in the eventual capture of Cetshwayo.

On 1 September 1879, Zululand was annexed and incorporated in Natal. In the Ulundi Settlement of 1879, Dunn was given the largest piece of land of all thirteen rulers in the subdivision of Zululand, which was also closest to Durban, placing him in charge of a buffer zone between the British and the less-trusted rulers. These subdivisions would last until Cetshwayo returned from exile in January 1883. Then the thirteen chiefs were disposed, Dunn lost his power and income and was included in a large native reserve under the control of the British Commander Sir Garnet Wolseley.

==Marriage==

Though he was already married to Catherine Pierce - daughter of a white settler father and mother of Cape Malay ancestry - he accepted a total of 48 Zulu wives during his lifetime, much to Catherine&#x27;s disapproval. Apart from two wives presented to him by Cetshwayo after a gift of two firearms, he followed Zulu custom and paid &quot;lobola&quot; of nine to fifteen cattle for each of the other forty-six wives. The Zulu wives came from twenty-three different clans mostly from the southern and central coastal regions. All were married in the native custom, though some were baptised, converting as Roman Catholics or Anglicans, with all his children brought up as Christians and given some schooling.

Dunn&#x27;s residences were constructed in the form of traditional Zulu kraals. His western style house stood at its centre, with separate beehive huts for his wives, soldiers, servants and Zulu visitors, cattle kraals, stables and food storage pits, all surrounded by a hedge of thorns. He maintained kraals at Mangete, Emoyeni and Ngoya with wives at each place. He
banished several wives for breaching his household rules and executed at least two for adultery. His wives and children were not allowed to interact socially with his white guests and his coloured children were discouraged from any serious interaction with their black siblings.

==Later years and heritage==
John Dunn died on 5 August 1895 of dropsy and heart disease and was buried at Emoyeni in the Colony of Natal, having married 48 wives and fathered 117 children. He was survived by 23 wives including Catherine, besides 33 sons and 46 daughters. Catherine died on 27 January 1905, at age 72. All of Dunn&#x27;s dependents were settled on a 40 km2 reserve near the Tugela River. Their ownership of the land was confirmed by the John Dunn Land Distribution Acts of 1902 and 1935.

It was however only by 1974, during the Apartheid years and 84 years since the death of John Dunn, that the Dunn family was able to obtain title deeds for Dunnsland, i.e. Mangete and Emoyeni. This process, complicated by racial legislation, was driven by Daniel Dunn, great-grandson of John and the then chairman of the Dunn&#x27;s Descendants Association.

Starting 1971 however, a neighbouring Zulu chief laid claim to the 68 farms. The situation escalated from 1996 onwards when chief Nkosi Mathaba began settling his Macambini clan members on the Dunn farms, and some 2,000 squatters built their shacks on the cane plantations. In 2004, after an eight-year court battle, the land was restored to the Dunn family, of whom almost 1,000 were still resident on the farms.

<doc id="530620" wikidata="Q16011858" url="?curid=530620" title="Henry Herbert, 6th Earl of Carnarvon">
<text>Henry George Alfred Marius Victor Francis Herbert, 6th Earl of Carnarvon (7 November 1898 – 22 September 1987), was a British peer. He was the son of George, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, and Almina Wombwell.

==Life==
Styled Lord Porchester from birth, he described in his memoirs an unloving upbringing by his parents, spending much of his time with his grandmother Marie &quot;Mina&quot; Wombwell (). He was educated at Ludgrove School, Eton and Sandhurst. During the First World War he served with the 7th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars in India and Mesopotamia, remaining in the army after the war. 

He inherited the Earldom of Carnarvon in April 1923 on the death of his father – who had funded archaeologist Howard Carter&#x27;s search for the tomb of Tutankhamun. The new earl&#x27;s view of the suggested &#x27;Curse of Tutankhamun&#x27; was that &quot;however sceptical I might have been, I could not dismiss the matter out of hand&quot;, claiming that the moment his father died on 5 April in Egypt, the family dog howled and died a sympathetic death at Highclere Castle, the family seat. On becoming Earl, he took on responsibility for the upkeep of Highclere Castle and its 4,000 acre estate. His mother remarried only eight months after the death of her first husband.

In March 1940, Lord Carnarvon re-joined the 7th Hussars as a lieutenant. During the War he held a number of staff positions in England, rising to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. In 1948 he was awarded the US Bronze Star Medal. 

While Lord Carnarvon&#x27;s pursuits included fox hunting, grouse shooting, and polo, his foremost interest was horse racing. He declared that &quot;racing and breeding is a way of life and I expect I shall continue to the end of my days.&quot; He had owned racehorses continuously since the age of 15. He also owned and ran the Highclere Stud, established by his father, which bred many winners, including the 1930 Epsom Derby winner Blenheim. He regularly rode as an amateur rider on the flat. His son, the 7th Earl, having inherited the family love of horses and their breeding, became Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s racing manager.

His obituary by Hugh Massingberd described him as a &quot;most uncompromisingly direct ladies&#x27; man&quot;.

==Marriages and issue==
Henry Herbert, 6th Earl of Carnarvon married Anne &quot;Catherine&quot; Tredick Wendell, of New York City, on 17 July 1922 at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster. The daughter of actor Jacob Wendell and sister of Philippa Stewart, Countess of Galloway, they divorced in 1936 after having had two children:
*Henry George Reginald Molyneux Herbert, 7th Earl of Carnarvon (19 January 1924 – 11 September 2001). He married Jean Margaret Wallop, daughter of Hon. Oliver Malcolm Wallop and Jean Moore, on 7 January 1956. They have three children:
**George Herbert, 8th Earl of Carnarvon (10 November 1956)
**The Hon. Henry &quot;Harry&quot; Herbert (2 March 1959)
**Lady Carolyn Herbert (27 January 1962).
*Lady Anne &quot;Penelope&quot; Marian Herbert (3 March 1925 – 1990). She married her second cousin Captain Reinier Gerrit Anton van der Woude, son of R.A.G van der Woude and his wife Mary Wendell, daughter of Harvard professor Barrett Wendell, on 21 April 1945. They had three children:
**Michael Gerrit van der Woude (25 March 1946 – 14 January 2008)
**David Anthony van der Woude (7 November 1947)
**Penelope Catherine Mary van der Woude (19 August 1952 – 1978).

Following his divorce from Catherine, Lord Carnarvon married Ottilie Ethel Leopoldine Losch, an Austrian dancer with the stage name Tilly Losch, on 1 September 1939. They divorced in 1947.

On his death on 22 September 1987 aged 88, he was succeeded by his son, Henry George Reginald Molyneux Herbert, 7th Earl of Carnarvon. 

The 6th Earl had a younger sister, who became Lady Evelyn Beauchamp.

==Publications==
Late in life he published two books of memoirs:
* &quot;No Regrets: Memoirs of the Earl of Carnarvon&quot; (1976) Weidenfeld and Nicolson. () 
* &quot;Ermine Tales: More Memoirs of the Earl of Carnarvon&quot; (1980) Weidenfeld and Nicolson. ()

<doc id="530622" wikidata="Q7439100" url="?curid=530622" title="Screw sloop">
<text>A screw sloop is a propeller-driven sloop-of-war. They were popularized in the mid-19th century, during the introduction of the steam engine and the transition of fleets to this new technology.

== The sailing sloop ==

=== The British sloop in the Age of Sail ===
In the Age of Sail, there was a large variety of terms to describe sailing vessels. In British English, the meaning of the term &#x27;sloop&#x27; depends on the context. The main source of confusion about the term sloop, is that for commercial vessels, &#x27;sloop&#x27; referred and refers to a vessel with a single mast rigged fore-and-aft. If the term referred to a British warship, its meaning was heavily dependent on the number of officers and men on the vessel. Under the rating system of the Royal Navy, any vessel that did not require a post-captain as commander was a sloop. This generally referred to all vessels with fewer than 20 guns. By this system, small frigates that lost most of their guns and sailors so they could be used as transports would be reclassified as sloops. The same logic also applied to fireships, which were typically made by converting fifth- or sixth-rate ships.

In the late 17th century, sloops were generally ketch-rigged bomb vessels or generally ship-rigged fireships. After the start of the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1756, most sloops were designed to have three masts.

== Under steam ==

Steam vessels driven by propellers were differentiated from those driven by paddle-wheels by referring to the ship&#x27;s &quot;screws&quot; (propellers). Other propeller-driven warships included the heavier steam corvette and the lighter gun vessel.

=== The United Kingdom ===
By 1833, the Royal Navy&#x27;s vessels fell into three classes:
# Rated ships and yachts, commanded by captains
# Sloops and bomb vessels, commanded by commanders.
# All other smaller vessels, commanded by lieutenants and inferior officers.

At the time, sloops could be ships (with three masts) or brigs (with two masts) or be corvette-built (also with three masts) or otherwise. The term sloop referred to a sailing vessel. Small paddle steamers like HMS &quot;Rhadamanthus&quot;, &quot;Meteor&quot;, and &quot;Firebrand&quot; were listed as &#x27;steam vessels&#x27;.

In 1840, the steam vessels of the Royal Navy were also divided into classes:
* First class: commanded by captains, e.g. HMS &quot;Cyclops&quot; and HMS &quot;Gorgon&quot;
* Second class: commanded by commanders, e.g. HMS &quot;Rhadamanthus&quot; and the &quot;Hydra&quot;-class sloop
* Third class: commanded by lieutenants and masters, e.g. &quot;Meteor&quot; and &quot;Firebrand&quot; 

By 1845, the List of the Royal Navy referred to dozens of &#x27;steam sloops&#x27;. Most of these were commanded by a commander, many others had a lieutenant commander. &quot;Cyclops&quot; was still a steam frigate. &quot;Gorgon&quot; was now a steam sloop commanded by a captain. &quot;Hydra&quot; was a steam sloop. &quot;Meteor&quot; was a steam vessel. 

In 1845, the first screw sloop appeared in the Royal Navy. The first four &quot;Alecto&quot;-class sloops had been launched in 1839–1841. The fifth unit of this class, &quot;Rattler&quot;, was reordered as a screw-propelled vessel. In spring 1845, comparative trials were held between &quot;Rattler&quot; and &quot;Alecto&quot;. The most famous of these was that in which the sloops towed stern to stern, with &quot;Rattler&quot; towing &quot;Alecto&quot; backwards at 2.8 knots.

=== In the USA ===
In the 1860s American context, the general meaning of the word &#x27;sloop&#x27; was a three-masted square-rigged ship with a full broadside on a single deck. In a looser sense, it could also refer to a three-masted vessel like CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;, which was a barque and lacked a full broadside.

USS &quot;Princeton&quot; launched in September 1843, was the first world&#x27;s screw steam vessel of war. She had been designed by John Ericsson, who had previously applied the screw to commercial boats. &quot;Princeton&quot; was also revolutionary because it had its engines under the waterline and had an armament that included a very high-caliber wrought-iron gun. This gun proved able to penetrate of armor. The success of &quot;Princeton&quot; led the United States Navy to slowly shift to the propeller as means of propulsion. 

In 1857 the United States ordered 5 large screw sloops. USS &quot;Hartford&quot; was a good example of these. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; also belonged to this order that made the screw sloop popular. In 1858, seven smaller screw sloops were ordered. USS &quot;Mohican&quot; and &quot;Narragansett&quot; were examples of these seven.

*USS &quot;Alaska&quot;
*USS &quot;Contoocook&quot;
*HMS &quot;Gannet&quot;, now a museum ship.

<doc id="530628" wikidata="Q5722880" url="?curid=530628" title="Henry Herbert, 7th Earl of Carnarvon">
<text>Henry George Reginald Molyneux Herbert, 7th Earl of Carnarvon, (19 January 1924 – 11 September 2001),
was a British peer and racing manager to Queen Elizabeth II from 1969 until his death.
From his birth until September 1987, he was known by the courtesy title Lord Porchester.

A member of Hampshire County Council for 24 years, he was its chairman from 1973 to 1977 and also served on other public bodies, including the Sports Council and the Agricultural Research Council.

He owned the Highclere Castle estate.

==Life and career==
Carnarvon was born in Lancaster Gate, west London, the only son of Catherine Herbert, Countess of Carnarvon, from New York, and Henry Herbert, 6th Earl of Carnarvon, who had recently inherited the family peerages. He was educated at Eton College, and during the Second World War was commissioned into the Royal Horse Guards, serving in Egypt and Italy. He left the army as a lieutenant in 1947, after which he studied at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, with a view to farming and managing the stud on his father&#x27;s Highclere estate.

Carnarvon was a personal friend of Princess Elizabeth, later Queen Elizabeth II, from their teenage years. She often visited Highclere Castle and – like his other friends – called him &#x27;Porchey&#x27;, after his courtesy title. In 1969, Carnarvon was appointed the Queen&#x27;s racing manager, a position he held until his death in 2001. His son the 8th Earl, who is the Queen&#x27;s godson, observed that

[I]t was a very equal friendship ranging over many interests. They were from the same generation. They had been through the war. They shared a great love of the countryside and wildlife as well as horses. He and the Queen had a similar passion for every aspect and detail of horse breeding.

The Queen attended the Earl&#x27;s funeral, and remained a friend of his widow, Jeanie.

As Lord Porchester, Carnarvon became an influential figure in British horseracing, establishing a reputation as a successful breeder at the Highclere Stud. He played a leading role in the administration and restructuring of the racing industry. In 1964 he was elected to the Jockey Club and was Chairman of the club&#x27;s race planning committee (1967–1985) and, as well as being the Queen&#x27;s racing manager, he was an active member of several other racing committees. He was appointed President of Newbury Racecourse in 1985.

Carnarvon was an independent member of the Hampshire County Council for 24 years and served as its chairman from 1973 to 1977. He also served on a number of public bodies, including the Sports Council (1965–1970), Agricultural Research Council (1978–1982) and was Chairman of the South East Economic Planning Council (1971–1979). He served as President of Hampshire County Cricket Club (1966–1968) and became Honorary Colonel of the 115th (Hampshire Fortress) Engineer Regiment (Territorial Army) in 1963.

He succeeded as Earl of Carnarvon in 1987, and sat in the House of Lords as a crossbencher, using his position to promote the interests of horseracing. He also inherited the family seat, Highclere Castle.

He was invested as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1976 Birthday Honours and Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in the 1982 Birthday Honours.

The Earl of Carnarvon died from a myocardial infarction at Highclere on 11 September 2001, at the age of 77. Earlier in the day he had watched television coverage of the September 11 attacks on the United States. Carnarvon was succeeded as the Queen&#x27;s racing manager by his son-in-law John Warren, a former stable boy who had worked at the Highclere Stud and married his daughter Carolyn.

==Marriage and children==
On 7 January 1956, Carnarvon (then known by his courtesy title Lord Porchester) married Jean Margaret Wallop (1935–2019) of Big Horn, Wyoming, in St. James&#x27; Episcopal Church in New York City. She was a granddaughter of Oliver Wallop, 8th Earl of Portsmouth. Carnarvon&#x27;s father, the 6th Earl had also married an Anglo-American.

The Earl and Countess of Carnarvon had three children:
* George Herbert, 8th Earl of Carnarvon (born 10 November 1956). Married Jayne Wilby on 16 December 1989, had two children, and divorced in January 1998. He then married Fiona Aitken on 18 February 1999 with whom he had one son:
** Lady Saoirse Herbert (born 2 June 1991)
** George Kenneth Oliver Molyneux Herbert, Lord Porchester (born 13 October 1992), the heir to the titles
** Hon. Edward Herbert (born 10 October 1999)
* The Hon. Henry &quot;Harry&quot; Malcolm Herbert (2 March 1959), who married Francesca &quot;Chika&quot; Vaughan Bevan (Francesca Herbert, now wife of Edward Fitzalan-Howard, 18th Duke of Norfolk). They married in 1992 and had three children. He married Clodagh McKenna, a TV chef and broadcaster and daughter of the late James J. McKenna and his wife Irene, on 14 August 2021 at the Church of Saint Michael and All Angels, Highclere.
** Chloe Victoria Herbert (born 1994)
** Francesca Jeanie Herbert (born 21 November 1995)
** William Henry Herbert (born 14 November 1999)
* Lady Carolyn Herbert, (born 27 January 1962), who married John Warren, racing manager to Queen Elizabeth II, in 1985. They have three children:

** Susanna Warren (born 1988)

<text>In electronics, the dynatron oscillator, invented in 1918 by Albert Hull at General Electric, is an obsolete vacuum tube electronic oscillator circuit which uses a negative resistance characteristic in early tetrode vacuum tubes, caused by a process called secondary emission. It was the first negative resistance vacuum tube oscillator. The dynatron oscillator circuit was used to a limited extent as beat frequency oscillators (BFOs), and local oscillators in vacuum tube radio receivers as well as in scientific and test equipment from the 1920s to the 1940s but became obsolete around World War 2 due to the variability of secondary emission in tubes.

Negative transconductance oscillators, such as the transitron oscillator invented by Cleto Brunetti in 1939, are similar negative resistance vacuum tube oscillator circuits which are based on negative transconductance (a fall in current through one grid electrode caused by an increase in voltage on a second grid) in a pentode or other multigrid vacuum tube. These replaced the dynatron circuit and were employed in vacuum tube electronic equipment through the 1970s.

==How they work==

The dynatron and transitron oscillators differ from many oscillator circuits in that they do not use feedback to generate oscillations, but negative resistance. A tuned circuit (resonant circuit), consisting of an inductor and capacitor connected together, is &quot;almost&quot; an oscillator: it can store electric energy in the form of oscillating currents, &quot;ringing&quot; analogously to a tuning fork. If a tuned circuit could have zero electrical resistance, once oscillations were started it would function as an oscillator, producing a continuous sine wave. But because of the inevitable resistance inherent in actual circuits, without an external source of power the energy in the oscillating current is dissipated as heat in the resistance, and any oscillations decay to zero.

In the dynatron and transitron circuits, a vacuum tube is biased so that one of its electrodes has negative differential resistance. This means that when the voltage on the electrode with respect to the cathode is increased, the current through it decreases. A tuned circuit is connected between the electrode and the cathode. The negative resistance of the tube cancels the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, creating in effect a tuned circuit with zero AC resistance. A spontaneous continuous sinusoidal oscillating voltage at the resonant frequency of the tuned circuit is generated, started by electrical noise in the circuit when it is turned on.

An advantage of these oscillators was that the negative resistance effect was largely independent of frequency, so by using suitable values of inductance and capacitance in the tuned circuit they could operate over a wide frequency range, from a few hertz to around 20 MHz. Another advantage was that they used a simple single LC tuned circuit without the taps or &quot;tickler&quot; coils required by oscillators such as the Hartley or Armstrong circuits.

==Dynatron oscillator==
In the dynatron a tetrode tube is used. In some tetrodes the plate (anode) has negative differential resistance, due to electrons knocked out of the plate when electrons from the cathode hit it, called &quot;secondary emission&quot;. This causes a downward &quot;kink&quot; in the plate current vs. plate voltage curve &quot;(graph below, grey region)&quot; when the screen grid is biased at a higher voltage than the plate, as described below. This negative resistance was mostly a feature of older tubes, of 1940s or earlier vintage. In most modern tetrodes, to prevent parasitic oscillations the plate is given a coating which drastically reduces the unwanted secondary emission, so these tubes have virtually no negative resistance &quot;kink&quot; in their plate current characteristic, and cannot be used in dynatron oscillators.

The tetrode wasn&#x27;t the only tube which could generate dynatron oscillations. Early triodes also had secondary emission and thus negative resistance, and before the tetrode was invented they were used in dynatron oscillators by biasing the control grid more positive than the plate. Hull&#x27;s first dynatron oscillator in 1918 used a special &quot;dynatron&quot; vacuum tube of his own design &quot;(shown above)&quot;, a triode in which the grid was a heavy plate perforated with holes which was robust enough to carry high currents. This tube saw little use as standard triode and tetrodes could function adequately as dynatrons. The term &quot;dynatron&quot; came to be applied to all negative resistance oscillations in vacuum tubes; for example the split-anode magnetron was said to work by &quot;dynatron oscillation&quot;.

An advantage of the dynatron circuit was that it could oscillate over a very wide frequency range; from a few hertz to 20 MHz. It also had very good frequency stability compared to other LC oscillators of that time, and was even compared to crystal oscillators. The circuit became popular after the advent of cheap tetrode tubes such as the UY222 and UY224 around 1928. It was used in beat frequency oscillators (BFOs) for code reception and local oscillators in superheterodyne receivers as well as in laboratory signal generators and scientific research. RCA&#x27;s 1931 prototype television used two UY224 tubes as dynatron oscillators to generate the vertical deflection (28 Hz) and horizontal deflection (2880 Hz) signals for the CRT&#x27;s deflection coils.

However the dynatron had some drawbacks. It was found that the amount of secondary emission current from the plate varied unpredictably from tube to tube, and also within a single tube over its operating life; eventually it would stop oscillating. When replacing the tube, several might have to be tried to find one that would oscillate in a circuit. In addition, since dynatron oscillations were a source of instability in amplifiers, the tetrode&#x27;s main application, tube manufacturers began applying a graphite coating to the plate which virtually eliminated secondary emission. By 1945 the use of the dynatron circuit was declining.

===Secondary emission===

In an electron tube, when electrons emitted by the cathode strike the plate, they can knock other electrons out of the surface of the metal, an effect called &quot;secondary emission&quot;. In a normal tetrode amplifier this is an unwanted effect, and the screen grid next to the plate is biased at a lower potential than the plate, so these &quot;secondary electrons&quot; are repelled and return to the plate due to its positive charge.

However, if the screen grid is operated at a higher potential than the plate, the secondary electrons will be attracted to it, and return to ground through the screen grid supply. This represents a current of electrons &quot;I&quot;G2 &quot;away&quot; from the plate, which reduces the net plate current &quot;I&quot;P below the cathode current &quot;I&quot;C
:formula_1
Higher plate voltage causes the primary electrons to hit the plate with more energy, releasing more secondary electrons. Therefore, starting at the voltage at which the primary electrons have enough energy to cause secondary emission, around &quot;V&quot;P = 10V, there is an operating region &quot;(grey)&quot; in which an increase in plate voltage causes more electrons to leave the plate than the additional electrons arriving at the plate, and therefore a net reduction in plate current.

===Negative resistance===
Since in this region an increase in plate voltage causes a decrease in plate current, the AC plate resistance, that is the differential output resistance of the tube, is negative:
:formula_2
As with other negative differential resistance devices like the tunnel diode, this negative resistance can be used to create an oscillator. A parallel tuned circuit is connected in the plate circuit of the tetrode. The circuit will oscillate if the magnitude of the negative plate resistance is less than the parallel resistance R of the tuned circuit, including any load connected to the oscillator.
:formula_3
The frequency of oscillation is close to the resonant frequency of the tuned circuit.
:formula_4

===Design===
As can be seen from the graphs, for dynatron operation the screen grid had to be biased at a considerably higher voltage than the plate; at least twice the plate voltage. The plate voltage swing is limited to the negative resistance region of the curve, the downward &quot;kink&quot;, so to achieve the largest output voltage swing, the tube should be biased in the center of the negative resistance region.

The negative resistance of older tetrode tubes was around 10kΩ - 20kΩ, and can be controlled by varying the control grid bias. If the magnitude of the negative resistance |r&quot;P| is just small enough to start oscillation, just a little smaller than the positive resistance R&quot; of the tuned circuit, the oscillation frequency will be very stable, and the output waveform will be almost sinusoidal. If the negative resistance is made significantly smaller than the positive resistance, the voltage swing will extend into the nonlinear part of the curve, and the peaks of the sine wave output will be flattened (&quot;clipped&quot;).

==Transitron oscillator==

The transitron oscillator, invented by Cledo Brunetti in 1939, (although a similar effect was observed in tetrodes by Balthasar van der Pol in 1926, and Edward Herold described a similar oscillator in 1935) is a negative resistance oscillator circuit using a pentode vacuum tube, in which, instead of the plate, the screen grid has negative resistance due to being coupled to the suppressor grid. See the circuit at right. In the transitron, the screen grid is biased at a positive voltage &quot;(battery B1)&quot; above the plate voltage while the suppressor grid is biased negatively &quot;(battery B2)&quot;, at or below the cathode voltage. Therefore, all the electrons will be reflected by the negative suppressor grid and none will get through to the plate. The reflected electrons will instead be attracted to the screen grid, so the screen current will be high while the plate current will be zero. However, if the suppressor grid voltage is increased, as it approaches zero (the cathode voltage) electrons will begin to pass through it and reach the plate, so the number diverted to the screen grid, and thus the screen current, will decrease. Since the other grids don&#x27;t take significant current the cathode current formula_5 is split between the plate formula_6 and the screen grid formula_7: 
:formula_8
The division of current between the screen grid and plate is controlled by the suppressor voltage. This inverse relationship is indicated by saying the transconductance between the screen and suppressor grid (the change in screen current Δ&quot;I&quot;G2 divided by the change in suppressor voltage Δ&quot;V&quot;G3) is negative.

Since the suppressor grid voltage and not the screen grid voltage controls the screen current, if the suppressor and screen grid are coupled together with a capacitor (&quot;C2&quot;) so there is a constant potential difference between them, increasing the screen grid voltage will increase the suppressor voltage, resulting in a decrease in screen current. This means the screen grid has negative differential resistance with respect to the cathode, and can be used to create oscillations.

In the transitron circuit, the screen and suppressor grids are coupled with a bypass capacitor (&quot;C2&quot;) which has a low impedance at the oscillation frequency, so they have a constant potential difference. The parallel tuned circuit (&quot;C1-L&quot;) is connected between the screen grid and the cathode (through battery &quot;B1&quot;). The negative resistance of the screen grid cancels the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, causing oscillations. As in the dynatron oscillator the control grid can be used to adjust the negative resistance.

Since the transitron oscillator didn&#x27;t depend on secondary emission it was far more reliable than the dynatron. However, because the screen grid is not designed to handle high power, the oscillator&#x27;s output power is limited. Other tubes with multiple grids beside the pentode, such as the hexode and pentagrid converter tube, have been be used to make similar negative transconductance oscillators. Pentode tubes used in this circuit have a negative transconductance of only around −250 microsiemens, giving a negative resistance of −4000Ω. Tubes with more grids, such as the pentagrid converter, can be used to make transitron oscillators with higher transconductance, resulting in smaller negative resistance.

<doc id="530639" wikidata="Q6607791" url="?curid=530639" title="List of birds of South Asia">
<text>The birds of South Asia include the species found in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

This is not only a huge geographical area, but has a range of habitats extending from deserts to rainforest, and from the world&#x27;s highest mountains to coastal mangrove swamps.

These factors, coupled with the tropical climate, result in a large numbers of bird species, some 1300. As would be expected in the tropics, most of these, more than 1,000 species, are resident within the South Asia. The rest are mainly winter visitors from further north in Eurasia. Only eighteen species are purely summer visitors to the subcontinent.

141 species are endemic to the region, and 26 of these are endemic to Sri Lanka.

Because of the large number of species, the lists are divided into four parts.
* part 1 – Megapodes, Galliformes, Gruiformes and near passerines
* part 2 – remainder of non-passerines
* part 3 – passerines from pittas to cisticolas
* part 4 – passerines from Old World warblers to buntings

<doc id="530640" wikidata="Q5097687" url="?curid=530640" title="Childline">
<text>Childline is a British counselling service for children and young people under 19 in the United Kingdom provided by The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. They deal with any issues which cause distress or concern; some of the most common issues include child abuse, bullying, mental illness, parental separation and or divorce, teenage pregnancy, substance misuse, neglect, and psychological abuse.

==Confidentiality==
ChildLine Counsellors will not record calls but write down case notes of calls and sometimes counselling supervisors may also listen in to calls to make sure that they can help the best they can. If there is an immediate serious concern for someone&#x27;s welfare or they are worried a child&#x27;s life is in danger, notes may be passed on to relevant bodies, including the Police and the NHS. Callers are not required to provide their name; they can give as little or as much personal information as they wish.

==History==

In 1986 Esther Rantzen, presenter of consumer television show &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot;, suggested to the BBC that they create &quot;Childwatch&quot;, a programme about child abuse that was screened on 30 October 1986 on BBC1, the aim being to try to detect children at risk before their lives were in danger. Viewers were asked if they would take part in the survey in an edition of &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot;. A helpline was opened after the programme so that any child currently suffering abuse could call for help. Rantzen, together with her BBC producers Sarah Caplin and Ritchie Cogan, therefore suggested they should create a helpline specifically for children in danger or distress, to be open throughout the year, 24/7, and launch it on the programme. The project was made possible by a benefactor Ian Skipper who underwrote the charity for the first three years.

Childline joined the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) in February 2006, and extra resources were pledged in an attempt to ensure that no child&#x27;s call goes unanswered.

==UK operations==
Childline has 12 counselling centres around the UK and one home based team, staffed largely by volunteers. The bases are located in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Manchester, Liverpool, Prestatyn, Birmingham, Nottingham, London, Belfast and Foyle, supported by the online only centres at Leeds and Cardiff and the Virtual Base. A restructure in 2011 saw the closure of the Childline bases in Exeter and Edinburgh, with Swansea relocating to Cardiff. As many as 4,500 phone Childline every day, though only 2,500 of these callers can be answered due to lack of resources. Since the merger with the NSPCC the service has expanded, and depends on public generosity to pay for the phone calls.

Childline raises funds through several channels, including direct donations through the NSPCC, partnerships, events such as The X Factor Childline Ball and through third-party fundraising organisations such as Justgiving.

==Virtual Base==
Childline&#x27;s virtual base was started in April 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Counsellors in the virtual base answer emails sent by children and young people from their Childline accounts from their own home. 

==Childline Scotland==
Following Childline&#x27;s merger with NSPCC in 2006, Childline Scotland was run by Children 1st under contract, available to all young people in Scotland up to 18 years of age. It had at that time bases in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. The Edinburgh base has since closed.
As of March 2012, Childline Scotland is run directly by the NSPCC. In 2011 the NSPCC in Scotland began to work with partners to introduce new services for children and families.
==International==
Similar helplines using the name Childline have been formed in a number of countries. As of May 2013 these included Childline Botswana, Childline India, Childline Ireland (Leanbh), チャイルドライン (Japan), (Lithuania), Childline South Africa, National Child Protection Authority of Sri Lanka, Child Helpline Tanzania, Childline Trinidad and Tobago, as well as organizations in Namibia, Trinidad and Tobago, Gibraltar, Kenya, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Some of these are independent charities; others have been set up by existing children&#x27;s charities or more general helplines.

Childline in Ireland is run by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC). It was set up in 1989. In 2006 a text and online service, in association with Zamano, was established to increase the availability of the listening service for children in Ireland.

Childline Uganda helps people infected and affected by HIV/AIDS live a better life.

==Telephone number==
The freephone number, 0800 1111, was one of the first 0800 numbers to be issued in the United Kingdom. Before BT allocated this number to Childline, 0800 1111 was used as a test line number by technicians. Other early allocated 0800 numbers were 10 digit, including the prefix. Childline&#x27;s number is one of only a handful of 8 digit 0800 UK numbers to ever have been allocated and the only one still in use. Calls to the number do not appear on the phone bill.

Childline is also available on the harmonised European number for child helplines, 116111.
Young people can also contact Childline through their website, via 1-2-1 counsellor chat, SignVideo, Ask Sam and the &#x27;write an email&#x27; feature.

<doc id="530642" wikidata="Q584065" url="?curid=530642" title="Anti-thymocyte globulin">
<text>Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is an infusion of horse or rabbit-derived antibodies against human T cells and their precursors (thymocytes), which is used in the prevention and treatment of acute rejection in organ transplantation and therapy of aplastic anemia due to bone marrow insufficiency.

==Uses==
Two antithymocyte globulin (ATG) agents licensed for clinical use in the United States are Thymoglobulin (rabbit ATG, rATG, Genzyme) and Atgam (equine ATG, eATG, Pfizer). Thymoglobulin and Atgam are currently licensed for use in the treatment of renal allograft rejection; Atgam is additionally licensed for use in the treatment of aplastic anemia. Both drugs are used in off-label applications, especially as immunosuppression induction agents before and/or during kidney transplantation. A rabbit anti-T lymphocyte globulin made by Neovii Pharmaceuticals is marketed outside of the United States under the name Grafalon.

ATG administration very substantially reduces immune competence in patients with normal immune systems, through a combination of actions, some explicitly understood and some more hypothetical. rATG in particular effects large reductions (through cell lysis) in the number of circulating T lymphocytes, hence preventing (or at least delaying) the cellular rejection of transplanted organs. However, medical opinion remains divided as to when the benefit of this profound reduction in T cells outweighs the concomitant increased risks of infection and malignancy.

In the United States it is frequently given at the time of the transplant to prevent graft-versus-host disease, although many European centers prefer to reserve its use for the treatment of steroid-resistant acute rejection, as European centres generally serve more homogeneous populations and rejection tends to be less of a problem. 

==Complications and alternatives==
ATG use can induce cytokine release syndrome, and has been thought to increase the risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD); however, this association may not apply when lower dosing regimens are used. There is some evidence to suggest that inducing immunosuppression with rATG at organ transplantation may create conditions in the patient&#x27;s immune system favorable to the development of immunological tolerance, but the exact basis for such a development remains largely speculative. Temporary depletion of the T-cell population at the time of the transplant also risks delayed acute rejection, which may be missed and cause severe damage to the graft.

Anti-IL-2Rα receptor antibodies such as basiliximab and daclizumab are increasingly being used in place of ATG as an induction therapy, as they do not cause cytokine release syndrome and (theoretically) improve the development of tolerance.

The cytokine release syndrome associated with ATG administration frequently causes high grade fevers (over 39 °C), chills, and possibly rigors during administration, for which reason steroids (normally methylprednisolone), diphenhydramine 25–50 mg, and acetaminophen 650 mg are usually co-administered. Such adverse reactions can often be controlled by slowing the infusion rate.

==History==

The first report of immunizing an animal of one species (guinea pig) against the immune cells of another species (mouse lymphocytes) was by Élie Metchnikoff in 1899. He reported injecting cells recovered from mouse lymph nodes into Guinea pigs and waiting for the immunization to result in the accumulation of anti-mouse antibodies in the Guinea pig blood. When he subsequently collected serum from these Guinea pigs and injected it into normal mice he observed a marked depletion in the number of circulating mouse lymphocytes.

=== Status in graft-versus-host disease ===

Rabbit ATG has been used in two randomised trials to reduce acute graft versus host disease in recipients receiving progenitor cell transplants.
While higher doses (15 mg/kg) reduced acute graft versus host this was offset by increased infections. However a long term follow up showed that at both high and low (7.5 mg/kg) doses chronic graft versus host was reduced.
A similar trial of anti-lymphocyte globulin showed a trend in reduction of acute graft versus host that was not statistically significant, but a reduction in chronic graft versus host.
The Canadian Blood and Marrow Transplant Group is currently conducting the first randomised trial in chronic graft versus host using an even lower dose of rabbit ATG (4.5 mg/kg) in an attempt to confirm these observations. The endpoint is the reduction in the proportion of patients with chronic graft versus host at 1 year, off immunosuppressants.

<doc id="530643" wikidata="Q2212983" url="?curid=530643" title="Saint Michael's College">
<text>Saint Michael&#x27;s College (St. Mikes) is a private Catholic college in Colchester, Vermont, founded in 1904 by the Society of Saint Edmund. It grants Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in more than 40 majors to about 1,200 undergraduate students. Housing availability is guaranteed for all four years, and 92% of students live on campus.

==History==

In 1889, priests from the Society of Saint Edmund fled to the United States after widespread anti-clericalism swept France. In 1904, they opened Saint Michael&#x27;s Institute with an initial investment of $5,000. Thirty-four students aged 10 to 22 enrolled, with a tuition and board fee of $105. Slowly, the school discontinued its high school program. Gradually, the school transitioned from an academy to a traditional residential college. In 1939, graduate programs were offered for the first time.

Saint Michael&#x27;s Playhouse was opened in 1947, bringing professional summer theater to Vermont, and giving students the chance to work behind the scenes.

Before the 1950s, classes at Saint Michael&#x27;s were small, with just a few dozen Michaelmen in any class. In the 1950s, the college expanded to hundreds of students per class. To manage the influx of GI Bill students after World War II, Saint Michael&#x27;s acquired temporary housing in the form of military barracks from Fort Ethan Allen in Colchester. 

In the 1950s, freshmen were required to wear a dress shirt, coat, and tie to every class and for the evening meal. All dorm students said the rosary before retiring.

About 130 refugees from the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 came to the college. Most of them, already well-educated, came to learn English.

In April 1970, the Board of Trustees approved a proposal by then-president Bernard Boutin to become a co-educational institution. In 1972, the first four female graduates of Saint Michael&#x27;s received their degrees.

==Campus==
The college consists of two campuses, the Main (also called South) and the North.

The main campus is the original and largest, with most of the classrooms, administration buildings, and residence halls. The Quad is anchored by Durick Library to the west and the Chapel of Saint Michael the Archangel to the east. The three academic halls, Cheray Hall, Jeanmarie Hall, and Saint Edmund&#x27;s Hall, along with the McCarthy Arts Center line the Quad to the south. The Alliot Student Center and the four underclass residence halls wall the Quad on the north.

===Sustainability===
Saint Michael&#x27;s has taken many steps towards sustainability over the years. It was named the first fair trade school in Vermont. Along with the initiatives in the cafeteria, Saint Michael&#x27;s has an organic garden that started in 2008 and has grown into a huge project for students and faculty alike. The garden utilizes student volunteers through the Mobilization of Volunteer Efforts (MOVE) program and also works with summer interns and crew members to prepare the vegetables for Farm Stands that run from mid-summer through the beginning of fall. The school also provides a free CCTA (Chittenden County Transportation Authority Bus Route) commuter pass to all students, staff, and faculty. To improve water conservation, dual-flush handles for toilets have begun to be installed in various buildings around campus. All campus showerheads and sink aerators are low-flow. Saint Michael&#x27;s College also took the St. Francis Pledge, a promise, and commitment by Catholic individuals, families, parishes, organizations, and institutions to live their faith by protecting the environment and advocating on behalf of people in poverty who face the harshest impacts of global climate change. As part of the college&#x27;s ban on bottled water, the Office of Sustainability has installed several water bottle fill stations throughout campus, allowing students to more easily use their reusable water bottles. 

===Housing===

Students at Saint Michael&#x27;s College live in a variety of different housing facilities. Freshmen typically live in one of four double-style dorm buildings and share communal spaces, while sophomores and juniors usually live in one of three suite-style dorms and share a living room and bathroom with 3-7 other students. Seniors have the opportunity to live in one of four townhouse communities on campus where they will share a four-bedroom townhome with three other students.

<doc id="530655" wikidata="Q176235" url="?curid=530655" title="Tunnel diode">
<text>A tunnel diode or Esaki diode is a type of semiconductor diode that has effectively &quot;negative resistance&quot; due to the quantum mechanical effect called tunneling. It was invented in August 1957 by Leo Esaki and Yuriko Kurose when working at Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo, now known as Sony. In 1973, Esaki received the Nobel Prize in Physics for experimental demonstration of the electron tunneling effect in semiconductors. Robert Noyce independently devised the idea of a tunnel diode while working for William Shockley, but was discouraged from pursuing it. Tunnel diodes were first manufactured by Sony in 1957, followed by General Electric and other companies from about 1960, and are still made in low volume today.

Tunnel diodes have a heavily doped positive-to-negative (P-N) junction that is about 10 nm (100 Å) wide. The heavy doping results in a broken band gap, where conduction band electron states on the N-side are more or less aligned with valence band hole states on the P-side. They are usually made from germanium, but can also be made from gallium arsenide, gallium antimonide (GaSb) and silicon materials.

==Uses==
The negative differential resistance in part of their operating range allows them to function as oscillators and amplifiers, and in switching circuits using hysteresis. They are also used as frequency converters and detectors. Their low capacitance allows them to function at microwave frequencies, far above the range of ordinary diodes and transistors.
Due to their low output power, tunnel diodes are not widely used: Their radio frequency output is limited to a few hundred milliwatts due to their small voltage swing. In recent years, however, new devices that use the tunneling mechanism have been developed. The &quot;resonant-tunneling diode&quot; (RTD) has achieved some of the highest frequencies of any solid-state oscillator.

Another type of tunnel diode is a &quot;metal-insulator-insulator-metal&quot; (MIIM) diode, where an additional insulator layer allows &quot;step tunneling&quot; for more precise control of the diode. There is also a &quot;metal-insulator-metal&quot; (MIM) diode, but due to inherent sensitivities, its present application appears to be limited to research environments.

==Forward bias operation==
Under normal forward bias operation, as voltage begins to increase, electrons at first tunnel through the very narrow P-N junction barrier and fill electron states in the conduction band on the N-side which become aligned with empty valence band hole states on the P-side of the P-N junction. As voltage increases further, these states become increasingly misaligned, and the current drops. This is called &quot;negative differential resistance&quot; because current &quot;decreases&quot; with &quot;increasing&quot; voltage. As voltage increases beyond a fixed transition point, the diode begins to operate as a normal diode, where electrons travel by conduction across the P-N junction, and no longer by tunneling through the P–N junction barrier. The most important operating region for a tunnel diode is the &quot;negative resistance&quot; region. Its graph is different from normal P-N junction diode.

==Reverse bias operation==
When used in the reverse direction, tunnel diodes are called back diodes (or backward diodes) and can act as fast rectifiers with zero offset voltage and extreme linearity for power signals (they have an accurate square law characteristic in the reverse direction). Under reverse bias, filled states on the P-side become increasingly aligned with empty states on the N-side, and electrons now tunnel through the P-N junction barrier in reverse direction.

==Technical comparisons==

In a conventional semiconductor diode, conduction takes place while the P-N junction is forward biased and blocks current flow when the junction is reverse biased. This occurs up to a point known as the &quot;reverse breakdown voltage&quot; at which point conduction begins (often accompanied by destruction of the device). In the tunnel diode, the dopant concentrations in the P and N layers are increased to a level such that the reverse breakdown voltage becomes zero and the diode conducts in the reverse direction. However, when forward-biased, an effect occurs called quantum mechanical tunneling which gives rise to a region in its voltage vs. current behavior where an &quot;increase&quot; in forward voltage is accompanied by a &quot;decrease&quot; in forward current. This &quot;negative resistance&quot; region can be exploited in a solid state version of the dynatron oscillator which normally uses a tetrode thermionic valve (vacuum tube).

==Applications==
The tunnel diode showed great promise as an oscillator and high-frequency threshold (trigger) device since it operated at frequencies far greater than the tetrode could: well into the microwave bands. Applications of tunnel diodes included local oscillators for UHF television tuners, trigger circuits in oscilloscopes, high-speed counter circuits, and very fast-rise time pulse generator circuits. In 1977, the Intelsat V satellite receiver used a microstrip tunnel diode amplifier (TDA) front-end in the 14–15.5 GHz frequency band. Such amplifiers were considered state-of-the-art, with better performance at high frequencies than any transistor-based front end. The tunnel diode can also be used as a low-noise microwave amplifier. Since its discovery, more conventional semiconductor devices have surpassed its performance using conventional oscillator techniques. For many purposes, a three-terminal device, such as a field-effect transistor, is more flexible than a device with only two terminals. Practical tunnel diodes operate at a few milliamperes and a few tenths of a volt, making them low-power devices. The Gunn diode has similar high frequency capability and can handle more power.

Tunnel diodes are also more resistant to ionizing radiation than other diodes. This makes them well suited to higher radiation environments such as those found in space.

===Longevity===
Tunnel diodes are susceptible to damage by overheating, and thus special care is needed when soldering them.

Tunnel diodes are notable for their longevity, with devices made in the 1960s still functioning. Writing in &quot;Nature&quot;, Esaki and coauthors state that semiconductor devices in general are extremely stable, and suggest that their shelf life should be &quot;infinite&quot; if kept at room temperature. They go on to report that a small-scale test of 50 year-old devices revealed a &quot;gratifying confirmation of the diode&#x27;s longevity&quot;. As noticed on some samples of Esaki diodes, the gold-plated iron pins can in fact corrode and short out to the case. This can usually be diagnosed and treated with simple peroxide / vinegar technique normally used for repairing phone PCBs and the diode inside normally still works.

Surplus Russian components are also reliable and often can be purchased for a few pence, despite original cost being in the £30–50 range.
The units typically sold are GaAs based and have a ratio of 5:1 at around 1–20 mA pk, and so should be protected against overcurrent.

<doc id="530656" wikidata="Q7570604" url="?curid=530656" title="Southern Vermont College">
<text>Southern Vermont College was a private college on the former Edward Everett Estate (originally The Orchards) near Bennington, Vermont. The college closed in 2019.

==History==
Southern Vermont College was founded in 1926 as St. Joseph Business School, an institution offering certificates of proficiency in secretarial accounting, finance, shorthand and typewriting. Eleven students were in the first graduating class. In 1962, it became an accredited junior college, St. Joseph College, awarding associate degrees in business and secretarial science.

Twelve years later, in 1974, the college moved to the Edward Hamlin Everett Estate and became Southern Vermont College, a nonsectarian college. In the years immediately following this change of location, the college earned bachelor&#x27;s degree authority from the Vermont Department of Education and full accreditation with the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE).

In 2019, NECHE placed the college on &quot;show-cause&quot; status and asked the college to provide additional information about its financial stability to retain its accreditation. The college&#x27;s only alternative was to lower the admission numbers of its incoming freshman class. This option would leave the school with a financial deficit. The college&#x27;s president, David Rees Evans, announced the closure in March 2019, and the college closed after finishing the academic year in May 2019.

==Campus==
The 27-room Everett Mansion, listed (along with most of the campus) on the National Register of Historic Places, served as the college&#x27;s primary administrative and academic building. It was built 1911–14 for Edward H. Everett, a successful businessman from Cleveland, Ohio, and is architecturally a distinctive combination of Beaux-Arts and Norman Revival styles. The architect, George Oakley Totten Jr., also designed Everett&#x27;s Washington, DC residence, (formerly the Turkish embassy and now the Residence of the Ambassador of Turkey). It hosts the library, theatre, Center for Teaching and Learning (academic support), Burgdorff Gallery, eight classrooms, plus administrative offices. From 1977 to 1994, the theatre served as the residence for the regionally acclaimed Oldcastle Theatre Company.

The college had five residence halls, as well as a residence hall complex, Hunter Hall, that was completed in 2009 and accommodates 110 residential students. This residence hall, situated on the slopes of Mt. Anthony with views of the Green Mountains, is both a living and learning facility, with science and computer labs, study rooms, and an atrium overlooking a pond. Other buildings include the Dining Hall, Mountaineer Athletic Center with Fitness Center, and a 24-hour computer lab.

==Academics==
Southern Vermont College offered 16 academic degree programs in five academic divisions: The McCormick Division of Business, The Hunter Division of Humanities, The Division of Nursing, The John Merck Division of Science and Technology, and The Donald Everett Axinn Division of Social Sciences.

It was a member of the Association of Vermont Independent Colleges (AVIC) and the Vermont Campus Compact, affiliated with the national association of colleges that include community service, hands-on learning and civic engagement as part of their academic requirements. All first-year students at Southern Vermont College took &quot;Quest for Success,&quot; a course that combined classroom instruction with off-campus community projects in such fields as environmental restoration, research on historic objects in the local museum work with a local theater company, and media studies with Community Access Television.

In the fall of 2013, Southern Vermont College partnered with the College Steps Program, joining two other Vermont colleges engaged in this program aimed at supporting students with cognitive impairments (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities). It provided them with an opportunity to participate in a modified two-year college experience.

In January 2014, Southern Vermont College established the Veterans&#x27; Scholar Program (VSP). The program worked with veterans and military-connected family members.

==Athletics==
The Southern Vermont athletic teams were called the Mountaineers. The college was a member of the NCAA Division III ranks, primarily competing in the New England Collegiate Conference (NECC) from 2008–09 to 2018–19. The Mountaineers previously competed in the Great Northeast Athletic Conference (GNAC) from 1998–99 to 2007–08.

Southern Vermont competed in 13 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports included baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer, track &amp; field (outdoor) and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports included basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, softball, track &amp; field (outdoor) and volleyball.

===Accomplishments===
In the fall of 2012, the women&#x27;s volleyball team won the NECC Championship for the third consecutive year.

In 2015, their Men&#x27;s basketball team went undefeated in NECC regular season play before losing to Regis College in the NECC championship game 74-72. However, the Mountaineers came back with another undefeated regular season in 2016 and went on to win the NECC championship against Becker College.

<doc id="530657" wikidata="Q3961647" url="?curid=530657" title="Cytokine release syndrome">
<text>In immunology, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a form of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that can be triggered by a variety of factors such as infections and certain drugs. It refers to cytokine storm syndromes (CSS) and occurs when large numbers of white blood cells are activated and release inflammatory cytokines, which in turn activate yet more white blood cells. CRS is also an adverse effect of some monoclonal antibody medications, as well as adoptive T-cell therapies. When occurring as a result of a medication, it is also known as an infusion reaction.

The term cytokine storm is often used interchangeably with CRS but, despite the fact that they have similar clinical phenotype, their characteristics are different. When occurring as a result of a therapy, CRS symptoms may be delayed until days or weeks after treatment. Immediate-onset CRS is a cytokine storm, although severe cases of CRS have also been called cytokine storms.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms include fever that tends to fluctuate, fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, fast breathing, rapid heartbeat, low blood pressure, seizures, headache, confusion, delirium, hallucinations, tremor, and loss of coordination.

Lab tests and clinical monitoring show low blood oxygen, widened pulse pressure, increased cardiac output (early), potentially diminished cardiac output (late), high levels of nitrogen compounds in the blood, elevated D-dimer, elevated transaminases, factor I deficiency and excessive bleeding, higher-than-normal level of bilirubin.

==Cause==
CRS occurs when large numbers of white blood cells, including B cells, T cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and monocytes are activated and release inflammatory cytokines, which activate more white blood cells in a positive feedback loop of pathogenic inflammation. Immune cells are activated by stressed or infected cells through receptor-ligand interactions.

This can occur when the immune system is fighting pathogens, as cytokines produced by immune cells recruit more effector immune cells such as T-cells and inflammatory monocytes (which differentiate into macrophages) to the site of inflammation or infection. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines binding their cognate receptor on immune cells results in activation and stimulation of further cytokine production.

Adoptive cell transfer of autologous T-cells modified with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR-T cell therapy) also causes CRS. Serum samples of patients with CAR-T associated CRS have elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-8 (CXCL8), IL-10, GM-CSF, MIP-1α/β, MCP-1 (CCL2), CXCL9, and CXCL10 (IP-10). The most predictive biomarkers 36h after CAR-T infusion of CRS are a fever ≥38.9 °C (102 °F) and elevated levels of MCP-1 in serum. Many of the cytokines elevated in CRS are not produced by CAR-T cells, but by myeloid cells that are pathogenically licensed through T-cell-mediated activating mechanisms. For example, in vitro co-culture experiments have demonstrated IL-6, MCP-1, and MIP-1 are not produced by CAR-T cells, but rather by inflammatory myeloid lineage cells. In vivo models have demonstrated NSG (NOD/SCID/γ-chain deficient mice) with defects of both lymphocyte and myeloid lineage compartments do not develop CRS after CAR-T cell infusion.

In addition to adoptive T-cell therapies, severe CRS or cytokine reactions can occur in a number of infectious and non-infectious diseases including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, Ebola, avian influenza, smallpox, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is sufficiently cleared by the early acute phase anti-viral response in most individuals, some progress to a hyperinflammatory condition, often with life-threatening pulmonary involvement. This systemic hyperinflammation results in inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart, causing ARDS and cardiac failure. Patients with fulminant COVID-19 and ARDS have classical serum biomarkers of CRS including elevated CRP, LDH, IL-6, and ferritin.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and Epstein-Barr virus-related hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis are caused by extreme elevations in cytokines and can be regarded as one form of severe cytokine release syndrome.

===Medications===
Cytokine reaction syndrome may also be induced by certain medications, such as the CD20 antibody rituximab and the CD19 CAR T cell tisagenlecleucel. The experimental drug TGN1412—also known as Theralizumab—caused extremely serious symptoms when given to six participants in a Phase I trial. A controlled and limited CRS is triggered by active fever therapy with mixed bacterial vaccines (MBV) according to Coley; it is used for oncological and certain chronic diseases. CRS has also arisen with biotherapeutics such as COVID-19 vaccines (Frontiers of Immunology 2022 13: 967226) and monoclonal antibodies intended to suppress or activate the immune system through receptors on white blood cells. Muromonab-CD3, an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody intended to suppress the immune system to prevent rejection of organ transplants; alemtuzumab, which is anti-CD52 and used to treat blood cancers as well as multiple sclerosis and in organ transplants; and rituximab, which is anti-CD20 and used to treat blood cancers and auto-immune disorders, all cause CRS.

==Diagnosis==
CRS needs to be distinguished from symptoms of the disease itself and, in the case of drugs, from other adverse effects—for example tumor lysis syndrome requires different interventions. As of 2015, differential diagnoses depended on the judgement of doctor as there were no objective tests.

===Classification===
CRS is a form of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and is an adverse effect of some drugs.

The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events classifications for CRS as of version 4.03 issued in 2010 were:

==Prevention==
Severe CRS caused by some drugs can be prevented by using lower doses, infusing slowly, and administering anti-histamines or corticosteroids before and during administration of the drug.

&quot;In vitro&quot; assays have been developed to understand the risk that pre-clinical drug candidates might cause CRS and guide dosing for Phase I trials, and regulatory agencies expect to see results of such tests in investigational new drug applications.

A modified Chandler loop model can be used as a preclinical tool to assess infusion reactions.

==Management==
Treatment for less severe CRS is supportive, addressing the symptoms like fever, muscle pain, or fatigue. Moderate CRS requires oxygen therapy and giving fluids and antihypotensive agents to raise blood pressure. For moderate to severe CRS, the use of immunosuppressive agents like corticosteroids may be necessary, but judgment must be used to avoid negating the effect of drugs intended to activate the immune system.

Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody, was FDA approved for steroid-refractory CRS based on retrospective case study data.

Lenzilumab, an anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, is also clinically proven to be effective at managing cytokine release by reducing activation of myeloid cells and decreasing the production of IL-1, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1, and IP-10. Additionally, as a soluble cytokine blockade, it will not increase serum levels of GM-CSF (a phenomenon seen with tocilizumab and IL-6).

Although frequently used to treat severe CRS in people with ARDS, corticosteroids and NSAIDs have been evaluated in clinical trials and have shown no effect on lung mechanics, gas exchange, or beneficial outcome in early established ARDS.

==Epidemiology==
Severe CRS is rare. Minor and moderate CRS are common side effects of immune-modulating antibody therapies and CAR-T therapies.

==Research==
Key therapeutic targets to abrogate hyper-inflammation in CRS are IL-1, IL-6, and GM-CSF. An in vivo model found that GM-CSF knockout CAR-T cells do not induce CRS in mice. However, IL-1 knockout and IL-6 knockout hosts (whose myeloid cells are deficient in IL-1 and IL-6, respectively) were susceptible to CRS after the administration of wild-type CAR-T cells. It is thought this may be because while blockade of IL-1 and IL-6 are myeloid-derived cytokines are thus too far downstream of the inflammatory cascade. Moreover, while tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody) may have an anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effect, it has been shown to increase serum levels of IL-6 by saturating the receptor, thus driving the cytokine across the blood brain barrier (BBB) and worsening neurotoxicity. Monoclonal antibody blockade of GM-CSF with lenzilumab has been demonstrated to protect mice from CAR-T associated CRS and neurotoxicity while maintaining anti-leukemic efficacy.

<text>Máni (Old Norse: ; &quot;Moon&quot;) is the Moon personified in Germanic mythology. Máni, personified, is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Both sources state that he is the brother of the personified sun, Sól, and the son of Mundilfari, while the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; adds that he is followed by the children Hjúki and Bil through the heavens. As a proper noun, Máni appears throughout Old Norse literature. Scholars have proposed theories about Máni&#x27;s potential connection to the Northern European notion of the Man in the Moon, and a potentially otherwise unattested story regarding Máni through skaldic kennings.

==Attestations==

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===

In the poem &quot;Völuspá&quot; Odin recounts the history of the universe and foretells the future. In doing so, he recounts the early days of the universe:


In stanza 23 of the poem &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, the god Odin (disguised as &quot;Gagnráðr&quot;) tasks the jötunn Vafþrúðnir with a question about the origins of the Sun and the Moon, whom he describes as journeying over mankind. Vafþrúðnir responds that Mundilfari is the father of both Sól and Máni, and that they must pass through the heavens every day to count the years for mankind:


In stanza 39 of the poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, Odin (disguised as &quot;Grímnir&quot;) says that both the Sun and the Moon are pursued through the heavens by wolves; the Sun, referred to as the &quot;shining god&quot; is pursued by Sköll to the &quot;protecting woods&quot;, while the moon is pursued by Hati Hróðvitnisson. In stanza 13 of the poem &quot;Alvíssmál&quot;, the god Thor questions the dwarf Alvíss about the Moon, asking him what the Moon is called in each of the worlds. Alvíss responds that it is called &quot;moon&quot; by mankind, &quot;fiery one&quot; by the gods, &quot;the whirling wheel&quot; in Hel, &quot;the hastener&quot; by the jötnar, &quot;the shiner&quot; by the dwarves, and &quot;the counter of years&quot; by the elves.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===

In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Máni is referenced in three chapters. In chapter 8, the enthroned figure of High quotes stanza 5 of &quot;Völuspá&quot;, and the figure of Third, also enthroned, adds that this occurred prior to the creation of the Earth. In chapter 11, High says that Máni and his sister Sól are the children of a man by the name of Mundilfari. The children were so fair that Mundilfari named them &quot;moon&quot; and &quot;sun&quot;. Perceiving this as arrogance, the gods were so angered that they placed the brother and sister in the heavens. There, Máni &quot;guides the path of the moon and controls its waxing and waning.&quot;

Additionally, Máni is followed through the heavens by the brother and sister children Hjúki and Bil &quot;as can be seen from the earth&quot;, whom he took from the Earth while they fetched water from a well. In chapter 51, High foretells the events of Ragnarök, including that Máni will be consumed by one of two wolves chasing the heavenly bodies.

In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Sól is referred to in chapter 26 as &quot;sister of Máni&quot;, and in chapter 55 names are given for the Moon: &quot;lune&quot;, &quot;waxer&quot;, &quot;waner&quot;, &quot;year-counter&quot;, &quot;clipped&quot;, &quot;shiner&quot;, &quot;gloam&quot;, &quot;hastener&quot;, &quot;squinter&quot; and &quot;gleamer&quot;.

==Theories==

Kennings in the skaldic corpus for female jötnar have been identified (such as &quot;desired woman of Máni&quot; used by the 10th century skald Guthormr sindri) as pointing to a potential marriage or sexual union between Máni and a female jötunn. John Lindow states that if a story about Máni having such a relationship with a female jötunn existed, then &quot;it has left no other trace in the extant mythology. Rudolf Simek states that in two skaldic kennings &quot;Máni is apparently a gigantic being in a myth of which we otherwise know nothing&quot;.

John Lindow theorizes on Máni&#x27;s fate at Ragnarök in that &quot;as part of the creation of the æsir, that is, the cosmos, Máni must be destroyed at Ragnarök, but this is not explicitly stated, except perhaps by Snorri, who tells about Mánagarm, who will swallow a heavenly body that may be the moon&quot;.

Rudolf Simek connects the account of Máni, and Hjúki and Bil (featuring, as Simek states, &quot;a man with a pole and a woman with a bushel&quot;) found in chapter 11 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; with modern accounts of the Man in the Moon found in modern folklore in Scandinavia, England, and North Germany. Simek additionally points out that a stanza appearing early in the poem &quot;Völuspá&quot; states that the Æsir had set up the Moon &quot;in order to be able to reckon the year&quot;, which Simek connects with Germanic computation of time having been directed towards the Moon rather than the Sun, and that shorter amounts of time were given in nights rather than days.

<text>William Dodd Hathaway (February 21, 1924June 24, 2013) was an American politician and lawyer from Maine. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a United States senator for Maine from 1973 to 1979, as the U.S. representative for Maine&#x27;s 2nd congressional district from 1965 to 1973, and as the commissioner of the Federal Maritime Commission from 1990 to 1999.

==Early life==
Hathaway was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He served in World War II in the United States Army Air Corps, where he was shot down while bombing the Ploiești, Romania oil fields during Operation Tidal Wave and was a prisoner of war for over two months. He was awarded the Air Medal, the Purple Heart, and the Distinguished Flying Cross.

After the war he attended Harvard University, graduating in 1949, and Harvard Law School, graduating in 1953. He then moved to Maine and practiced law in Lewiston.

==Political career==

He served as Assistant County Attorney for Androscoggin County from 1955 to 1957, and he was a Hearing Examiner for the State Liquor Commission from 1957 to 1961.

===U. S. Representative===
A Democrat, in 1964 he was elected to the U.S. House from the 2nd District after incumbent Republican Clifford McIntire ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate, and he served from 1965 until 1973. This was a time of resurgence for Democrats in Maine, at that time a traditionally Republican state. The same period saw the growth of the political careers of Edmund S. Muskie and Kenneth M. Curtis. as a congressman Hathaway supported President Johnson&#x27;s Great Society, he also helped lay groundwork to establish the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 

===U. S. senator===
In 1972 Hathaway ran for the United States Senate and defeated four-term Republican incumbent Margaret Chase Smith by 27,230 votes. In 1973, Hathaway was one of the three senators who opposed the nomination of Gerald Ford to be Vice President. (The other two were fellow Democrats Thomas Eagleton of Missouri and Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin.) One of his Senate aides was future Maine Governor and Senator Angus King. in 1973 Hathaway, received a letter from a woman complaining that she had been rejected by the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., because she was female. He then introduced legislation that led to the admission of women at West Point and other military academies in 1976. Hathaway was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1978, losing to his successor in the 2nd District, and future Secretary of Defense William Cohen, by 84,967 votes.

==Later life==
Hathaway resided in the Washington, D.C., area after leaving the Senate and worked as a lobbyist and lawyer. In 1990 he was appointed by President George H. W. Bush to the Federal Maritime Commission, and he served as chairman from 1993 to 1996.

Hathaway was known and well-liked by the employees of the U.S Senate, especially the Senate elevator operators. He was a constant source of humor and good will to those that worked on the Capitol elevators. &quot;Going Up&quot; is an unpublished manuscript by Kerry Whitney, US Senate Elevator Operator.

He retired in 1996 and continued to live in the Washington, DC, area.

In June 2002, at the age of 78, Hathaway was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism during Operation Tidal Wave.

Hathaway was married to Mary Lee Bird of Horse Shoe, North Carolina, and Akron, Ohio, for over 61 years until her death, in 2007. Hathaway had two children, Susan and Fred.

Hathaway died of pulmonary fibrosis exactly 69 years to the day after he was shot down during World War II.

<text>Anti-lymphocyte globulin (ALG) is an infusion of animal- antibodies against human T cells which is used in the treatment of acute rejection in organ transplantation. Its use was first reported by Thomas Starzl in 1966. Its use in transplant was supplanted by thymoglobulin between 1984 and 1999.

It has also been used in the treatment of aplastic anemia.

It is less commonly used than the similar anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), and like ATG it is associated with cytokine release syndrome in the short term and an increased risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder in the long term. ALG is more likely to cause side effects than ATG, but is safer than OKT3.

The product was manufactured by Upjohn and Merieux, as well as the Schweizerisches Serum- und Impfinstitut in Bern, the latter of which was made by injecting horses with human thoracic duct lymphocytes and was called &quot;Lymphoser Berna&quot;.

<text>Vermont Law and Graduate School (VLGS) is a private law and public policy graduate school in South Royalton, Vermont. It is the only ABA-accredited law school in the state. It offers several degrees, including Juris Doctor (JD), Master of Laws (LLM) in Environmental Law, Master of Environmental Law and Policy (MELP), Master of Food and Agriculture Law and Policy (MFALP), Master of Energy Regulation and Law (MERL), and dual degrees with a diverse range of institutions. According to the school&#x27;s 2018 ABA-required disclosures, 61.5% of the Class of 2018 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation.

==History==
=== Founding ===
Vermont Law School was founded in 1972 by Anthony Doria and held its first classes in the summer of 1973 with 113 students in what was then known as the old South Royalton schoolhouse. One of the founding professors was Alan Weinberger. In December 1973, VLS was certified by the Vermont State Board of Education as an institution of higher learning. Doria resigned as dean of the school in 1974, after it emerged that he had been convicted of embezzlement by a Pennsylvania court in 1960, though the charges were later vacated. A full complement of classes were offered in the fall of 1975 after provisional ABA accreditation. The Law School&#x27;s first class graduated in spring 1976. 

=== Since 2000 ===
From 1982 until 2011, Vermont Law School, along with William Mitchell College of Law, was one of two law schools in the U.S. to decline to receive federal funding under the Solomon Amendment. That statute passed by Congress required colleges and universities to allow military recruitment on campus or risk losing federal funding. The school is also part of FAIR Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, a consortium of 38 law schools and law faculties that challenged the Solomon Amendment in &quot;Rumsfeld v. FAIR&quot; and lost. Following the repeal of &#x27;Don&#x27;t Ask Don&#x27;t Tell&#x27; in 2011, the school has allowed military recruitment on campus.

In 2018, the law school controversially stripped tenure from 75% of its faculty, citing financial exigencies. Vermont Law School was subsequently sanctioned by the American Association of University Professors for &quot;serious departures by the administration and/or governing board from generally accepted standards of college and university government&quot;. Vermont Law and Graduate School has challenged many of the findings of the report. 

In 2022, the school added graduate programs and was renamed Vermont Law and Graduate School. It also added a hybrid JD program.

==Academics==
Vermont Law School was provisionally ABA accredited in 1975, and full approval in 1978. It has also been accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) since 1980. VLS became a member of the Association of American Law Schools (AALS) in 1981.

Vermont Law School also offers an Accelerated Juris Doctor program that allows JD students to graduate in just two years (as opposed to the traditional three-year JD program), through the completion of two full-time academic semesters during the summer.
As well as the Juris Doctor (JD), the Law School offers several degrees and joint-degrees, as well as degrees with other universities. Degrees include Master of Laws (LLM) in American Legal Studies, Environmental Law, Food and Agriculture Law, and in Energy Law

There is also a Master of Environmental Law and Policy (MELP), Master of Energy Regulation and Law (MERL), and Master of Food and Agriculture Law and Policy (MFALP). 

In 2022, the ABA&#x27;s Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar determined VLGS had failed to significantly comply with Standard 316, which was revised in 2019 to provide that at least 75% of an accredited law school&#x27;s graduates who took a bar exam must pass one within two years of graduation. Graduates in 2019 had a 67.54% bar pass rate. However, VLGS had an 82.84% pass rate in 2018, and the school described the 2019 results as an anomaly. The ABA determined the school was back in compliance by March of 2023.

===Joint programs===
The Law School has partnered with different domestic and international universities to offer dual-degree programs. Domestic schools include: Yale School of the Environment (JD/Master of Environmental Management), Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth (MELP/Master of Business Administration), the University of Vermont Rubenstein School of Natural Resources (MELP/Master of Science in Natural Resources), Thunderbird School of Global Management (JD/Masters of Business Administration), the University of South Carolina (MELP/JD), University of South Dakota (MELP/JD), and Northeastern University School of Law (MELP/JD). International universities include the University of Cambridge (JD/Master of Philosophy), Cergy-Pontoise University (France), and the University of Seville (Spain).

=== Julien and Virginia Cornell Library ===
The Julien and Virginia Cornell Library opened in 1991. The library contains over 250,000 print volumes, including primary and secondary legal materials focusing on state, national, and international law. The library also possesses a collection of microforms including congressional documents, state session laws, and briefs. The library&#x27;s electronic collection includes access to LexisNexis and Westlaw and other online gateways and databases, as well as a large catalog of full-text electronic journals and books and databases offering primary legal materials.

Vermont Law School maintains &quot;an extensive interdisciplinary environmental collection, including journals, monographs, electronic resources, and other material related to the study of the environment and environmental law and policy.&quot;

==Campus==
Vermont Law and Graduate School&#x27;s campus is located in South Royalton in central Vermont. The campus is set just above the broad banks of the White River.

The oldest and centermost classroom building on the campus is Debevoise Hall, the town&#x27;s original schoolhouse, built in 1892. In 2005 the former town schoolhouse (the original Law School building in 1973) was renovated and renamed after one of the first deans of the Law School, Thomas M. Debevoise. Practicing what it preaches, the Law School emphasized environmental concerns in the renovation, as well as historical preservation and design efficiency. Debevoise Hall was the only LEED Silver Certified renovation building project in the state of Vermont. Debevoise Hall continues to serve as classroom space and now also houses administration offices, the Environmental Law Center, and the Yates Common Room.

The James L. and Evelena S. Oakes Hall building was constructed and dedicated in 1998. Oakes Hall incorporates &quot;green building&quot; techniques along with the latest classroom technology.

Jonathon Chase, the late former dean of the Law School, liked to joke that South Royalton was the only town in America &quot;with a law school and no stop light.&quot; Vermont Law School holds the distinction of being the law school farthest from a traffic light. As of January 2021, South Royalton does not have a stoplight.

In January 2020, VLGS opened a new satellite office in Burlington, which hosts the school&#x27;s immigration law clinic and an additional admissions office.

<doc id="530691" wikidata="Q422549" url="?curid=530691" title="Glucocorticoid">
<text>Glucocorticoids (or, less commonly, glucocorticosteroids) are a class of corticosteroids, which are a class of steroid hormones. Glucocorticoids are corticosteroids that bind to the glucocorticoid receptor that is present in almost every vertebrate animal cell. The name &quot;glucocorticoid&quot; is a portmanteau (glucose + cortex + steroid) and is composed from its role in regulation of glucose metabolism, synthesis in the adrenal cortex, and its steroidal structure (see structure below).

Glucocorticoids are part of the feedback mechanism in the immune system, which reduces certain aspects of immune function, such as inflammation. They are therefore used in medicine to treat diseases caused by an overactive immune system, such as allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases, and sepsis. Glucocorticoids have many diverse effects such as pleiotropy, including potentially harmful side effects. They also interfere with some of the abnormal mechanisms in cancer cells, so they are used in high doses to treat cancer. This includes inhibitory effects on lymphocyte proliferation, as in the treatment of lymphomas and leukemias, and the mitigation of side effects of anticancer drugs.

Glucocorticoids affect cells by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor. The activated glucocorticoid receptor-glucocorticoid complex up-regulates the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins in the nucleus (a process known as transactivation) and represses the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins in the cytosol by preventing the translocation of other transcription factors from the cytosol into the nucleus (transrepression).

Glucocorticoids are distinguished from mineralocorticoids and sex steroids by their specific receptors, target cells, and effects. In technical terms, &quot;corticosteroid&quot; refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (as both are mimics of hormones produced by the adrenal cortex), but is often used as a synonym for &quot;glucocorticoid&quot;. Glucocorticoids are chiefly produced in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex, whereas mineralocorticoids are synthesized in the zona glomerulosa.

Cortisol (or hydrocortisone) is the most important human glucocorticoid. It is essential for life, and it regulates or supports a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic, and homeostatic functions. Increases in glucocorticoid concentrations are an integral part of stress response and are the most commonly used biomarkers to measure stress. Glucocorticoids have numerous non-stress-related functions as well, and glucocorticoid concentrations can increase in response to pleasure or excitement. Various synthetic glucocorticoids are available; these are widely utilized in general medical practice and numerous specialties, either as replacement therapy in glucocorticoid deficiency or to suppress the body&#x27;s immune system.

==Effects==
Glucocorticoid effects may be broadly classified into two major categories: immunological and metabolic. In addition, glucocorticoids play important roles in fetal development and body fluid homeostasis.

===Immune===
Glucocorticoids function via interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor:
* Upregulate the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins.
* Downregulate the expression of proinflammatory proteins.

Glucocorticoids are also shown to play a role in the development and homeostasis of T lymphocytes. This has been shown in transgenic mice with either increased or decreased sensitivity of T cell lineage to glucocorticoids.

===Metabolic===
The name &quot;glucocorticoid&quot; derives from early observations that these hormones were involved in glucose metabolism. In the fasted state, cortisol stimulates several processes that collectively serve to increase and maintain normal concentrations of glucose in the blood.

Metabolic effects:
* Stimulation of gluconeogenesis, in particular, in the liver: This pathway results in the synthesis of glucose from non-hexose substrates, such as amino acids and glycerol from triglyceride breakdown, and is particularly important in carnivores and certain herbivores. Enhancing the expression of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis is probably the best-known metabolic function of glucocorticoids.
* Mobilization of amino acids from tissues: These serve as substrates for gluconeogenesis.
* Inhibition of glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue: A mechanism to conserve glucose
* Stimulation of fat breakdown in adipose tissue: The fatty acids released by lipolysis are used for production of energy in tissues like muscle, and the released glycerol provide another substrate for gluconeogenesis.
* Increase in sodium retention and potassium excretion leads to hypernatremia and hypokalemia
* Increase in hemoglobin concentration, likely due to hindrance of the ingestion of red blood cell by macrophage or other phagocyte.
* Increased urinary uric acid
* Increased urinary calcium and hypocalcemia
* Alkalosis
* Leukocytosis

Excessive glucocorticoid levels resulting from administration as a drug or hyperadrenocorticism have effects on many systems. Some examples include inhibition of bone formation, suppression of calcium absorption (both of which can lead to osteoporosis), delayed wound healing, muscle weakness, and increased risk of infection. These observations suggest a multitude of less-dramatic physiologic roles for glucocorticoids.

===Developmental===
Glucocorticoids have multiple effects on fetal development. An important example is their role in promoting maturation of the lung and production of the surfactant necessary for extrauterine lung function. Mice with homozygous disruptions in the corticotropin-releasing hormone gene (see below) die at birth due to pulmonary immaturity. In addition, glucocorticoids are necessary for normal brain development, by initiating terminal maturation, remodeling axons and dendrites, and affecting cell survival and may also play a role in hippocampal development. Glucocorticoids stimulate the maturation of the Na+/K+/ATPase, nutrient transporters, and digestion enzymes, promoting the development of a functioning gastro-intestinal system. Glucocorticoids also support the development of the neonate&#x27;s renal system by increasing glomerular filtration.

===Arousal and cognition===
Glucocorticoids act on the hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal lobes. Along with adrenaline, these enhance the formation of flashbulb memories of events associated with strong emotions, both positive and negative. This has been confirmed in studies, whereby blockade of either glucocorticoids or noradrenaline activity impaired the recall of emotionally relevant information. Additional sources have shown subjects whose fear learning was accompanied by high cortisol levels had better consolidation of this memory (this effect was more important in men). The effect that glucocorticoids have on memory may be due to damage specifically to the CA1 area of the hippocampal formation.

In multiple animal studies, prolonged stress (causing prolonged increases in glucocorticoid levels) have shown destruction of the neurons in the hippocampus area of the brain, which has been connected to lower memory performance.

Glucocorticoids have also been shown to have a significant impact on vigilance (attention deficit disorder) and cognition (memory). This appears to follow the Yerkes–Dodson curve, as studies have shown circulating levels of glucocorticoids vs. memory performance follow an upside-down U pattern, much like the Yerkes–Dodson curve. For example, long-term potentiation (LTP; the process of forming long-term memories) is optimal when glucocorticoid levels are mildly elevated, whereas significant decreases of LTP are observed after adrenalectomy (low-glucocorticoid state) or after exogenous glucocorticoid administration (high-glucocorticoid state). Elevated levels of glucocorticoids enhance memory for emotionally arousing events, but lead more often than not to poor memory for material unrelated to the source of stress/emotional arousal. In contrast to the dose-dependent enhancing effects of glucocorticoids on memory consolidation, these stress hormones have been shown to inhibit the retrieval of already stored information. Long-term exposure to glucocorticoid medications, such as asthma and anti-inflammatory medication, has been shown to create deficits in memory and attention both during and, to a lesser extent, after treatment, a condition known as &quot;steroid dementia&quot;.

===Body fluid homeostasis===
Glucocorticoids could act centrally, as well as peripherally, to assist in the normalization of extracellular fluid volume by regulating body&#x27;s action to atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Centrally, glucocorticoids could inhibit dehydration-induced water intake; peripherally, glucocorticoids could induce a potent diuresis.

==Mechanism of action==
===Transactivation===
Glucocorticoids bind to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor, a type of nuclear receptor that is activated by ligand binding. After a hormone binds to the corresponding receptor, the newly formed complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to glucocorticoid response elements in the promoter region of the target genes resulting in the regulation of gene expression. This process is commonly referred to as transcriptional activation, or transactivation.

The proteins encoded by these up-regulated genes have a wide range of effects, including, for example:
* Anti-inflammatory – lipocortin I, p11/calpactin binding protein, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor 1 (SLPI), and Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase (MAPK phosphatase)
* Increased gluconeogenesis – glucose 6-phosphatase and tyrosine aminotransferase

===Transrepression===
The opposite mechanism is called transcriptional repression, or transrepression. The classical understanding of this mechanism is that activated glucocorticoid receptor binds to DNA in the same site where another transcription factor would bind, which prevents the transcription of genes that are transcribed via the activity of that factor. While this does occur, the results are not consistent for all cell types and conditions; there is no generally accepted, general mechanism for transrepression.

New mechanisms are being discovered where transcription is repressed, but the activated glucocorticoid receptor is not interacting with DNA, but rather with another transcription factor directly, thus interfering with it, or with other proteins that interfere with the function of other transcription factors. This latter mechanism appears to be the most likely way that activated glucocorticoid receptor interferes with NF-κB – namely by recruiting histone deacetylase, which deacetylate the DNA in the promoter region leading to closing of the chromatin structure where NF-κB needs to bind.

===Nongenomic effects===
Activated glucocorticoid receptor has effects that have been experimentally shown to be independent of any effects on transcription and can only be due to direct binding of activated glucocorticoid receptor with other proteins or with mRNA.

For example, Src kinase which binds to inactive glucocorticoid receptor, is released when a glucocorticoid binds to glucocorticoid receptor, and phosphorylates a protein that in turn displaces an adaptor protein from a receptor important in inflammation, epidermal growth factor, reducing its activity, which in turn results in reduced creation of arachidonic acid – a key proinflammatory molecule. This is one mechanism by which glucocorticoids have an anti-inflammatory effect.

==Pharmacology==
A variety of synthetic glucocorticoids, some far more potent than cortisol, have been created for therapeutic use. They differ in both pharmacokinetics (absorption factor, half-life, volume of distribution, clearance) and pharmacodynamics (for example the capacity of mineralocorticoid activity: retention of sodium (Na) and water; renal physiology). Because they permeate the intestines easily, they are administered primarily &quot;per os&quot; (by mouth), but also by other methods, such as topically on skin. More than 90% of them bind different plasma proteins, though with a different binding specificity. Endogenous glucocorticoids and some synthetic corticoids have high affinity to the protein transcortin (also called corticosteroid-binding globulin), whereas all of them bind albumin. In the liver, they quickly metabolize by conjugation with a sulfate or glucuronic acid, and are secreted in the urine.

Glucocorticoid potency, duration of effect, and the overlapping mineralocorticoid potency vary. Cortisol is the standard of comparison for glucocorticoid potency. Hydrocortisone is the name used for pharmaceutical preparations of cortisol.

The data below refer to oral administration. Oral potency may be less than parenteral potency because significant amounts (up to 50% in some cases) may not reach the circulation. Fludrocortisone acetate and deoxycorticosterone acetate are, by definition, mineralocorticoids rather than glucocorticoids, but they do have minor glucocorticoid potency and are included in this table to provide perspective on mineralocorticoid potency.

==Therapeutic use==
Glucocorticoids may be used in low doses in adrenal insufficiency. In much higher doses, oral or inhaled glucocorticoids are used to suppress various allergic, inflammatory, and autoimmune disorders. Inhaled glucocorticoids are the second-line treatment for asthma. They are also administered as post-transplantory immunosuppressants to prevent the acute transplant rejection and the graft-versus-host disease. Nevertheless, they do not prevent an infection and also inhibit later reparative processes. Newly emerging evidence showed that glucocorticoids could be used in the treatment of heart failure to increase the renal responsiveness to diuretics and natriuretic peptides. Glucocorticoids are historically used for pain relief in inflammatory conditions. However, corticosteroids show limited efficacy in pain relief and potential adverse events for their use in tendinopathies.

===Replacement===
Any glucocorticoid can be given in a dose that provides approximately the same glucocorticoid effects as normal cortisol production; this is referred to as physiologic, replacement, or maintenance dosing. This is approximately 6–12 mg/m2/day of hydrocortisone (m2 refers to body surface area (BSA), and is a measure of body size; an average man&#x27;s BSA is 1.9 m2).

===Therapeutic immunosuppression===
Glucocorticoids cause immunosuppression, and the therapeutic component of this effect is mainly the decreases in the function and numbers of lymphocytes, including both B cells and T cells.

The major mechanism for this immunosuppression is through inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). NF-κB is a critical transcription factor involved in the synthesis of many mediators (i.e., cytokines) and proteins (i.e., adhesion proteins) that promote the immune response. Inhibition of this transcription factor, therefore, blunts the capacity of the immune system to mount a response.

Glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and IFN-γ, the most important of which is IL-2. Smaller cytokine production reduces the T cell proliferation.

Glucocorticoids, however, not only reduce T cell proliferation, but also lead to another well known effect – glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. The effect is more prominent in immature T cells still inside in the thymus, but peripheral T cells are also affected. The exact mechanism regulating this glucocorticoid sensitivity lies in the Bcl-2 gene.

Glucocorticoids also suppress the humoral immunity, thereby causing a humoral immune deficiency. Glucocorticoids cause B cells to express smaller amounts of IL-2 and of IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clone expansion and antibody synthesis. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also cause fewer T lymphocyte cells to be activated.

The effect of glucocorticoids on Fc receptor expression in immune cells is complicated. Dexamethasone decreases IFN-gamma stimulated Fc gamma RI expression in neutrophils while conversely causing an increase in monocytes. Glucocorticoids may also decrease the expression of Fc receptors in macrophages, but the evidence supporting this regulation in earlier studies has been questioned. The effect of Fc receptor expression in macrophages is important since it is necessary for the phagocytosis of opsonised cells. This is because Fc receptors bind antibodies attached to cells targeted for destruction by macrophages.

===Anti-inflammatory===
Glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatories, regardless of the inflammation&#x27;s cause; their primary anti-inflammatory mechanism is lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis. Lipocortin-1 both suppresses phospholipase A2, thereby blocking eicosanoid production, and inhibits various leukocyte inflammatory events (epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst, etc.). In other words, glucocorticoids not only suppress immune response, but also inhibit the two main products of inflammation, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. They inhibit prostaglandin synthesis at the level of phospholipase A2 as well as at the level of cyclooxygenase/PGE isomerase (COX-1 and COX-2), the latter effect being much like that of NSAIDs, thus potentiating the anti-inflammatory effect.

In addition, glucocorticoids also suppress cyclooxygenase expression.

Glucocorticoids marketed as anti-inflammatories are often topical formulations, such as nasal sprays for rhinitis or inhalers for asthma. These preparations have the advantage of only affecting the targeted area, thereby reducing side effects or potential interactions. In this case, the main compounds used are beclometasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone and ciclesonide. In rhinitis, sprays are used. For asthma, glucocorticoids are administered as inhalants with a metered-dose or dry powder inhaler. In rare cases, symptoms of radiation induced thyroiditis has been treated with oral glucocorticoids.

===Hyperaldosteronism===
Glucocorticoids can be used in the management of familial hyperaldosteronism type 1. They are not effective, however, for use in the type 2 condition.

===Heart failure===
Glucocorticoids could be used in the treatment of decompensated heart failure to potentiate renal responsiveness to diuretics, especially in heart failure patients with refractory diuretic resistance with large doses of loop diuretics.

== Resistance ==
Resistance to the therapeutic uses of glucocorticoids can present difficulty; for instance, 25% of cases of severe asthma may be unresponsive to steroids. This may be the result of genetic predisposition, ongoing exposure to the cause of the inflammation (such as allergens), immunological phenomena that bypass glucocorticoids, pharmacokinetic disturbances (incomplete absorption or accelerated excretion or metabolism) and viral and/or bacterial respiratory infections.

== Side effects ==
Glucocorticoid drugs currently being used act nonselectively, so in the long run they may impair many healthy anabolic processes. To prevent this, much research has been focused recently on the elaboration of selectively acting glucocorticoid drugs. Side effects include:
* Immunodeficiency (see section below)
* Hyperglycemia due to increased gluconeogenesis, insulin resistance, and impaired glucose tolerance (&quot;steroid diabetes&quot;); caution in those with diabetes mellitus
* Increased skin fragility, easy bruising
* Negative calcium balance due to reduced intestinal calcium absorption
* Steroid-induced osteoporosis: reduced bone density (osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, higher fracture risk, slower fracture repair)
* Weight gain due to increased visceral and truncal fat deposition (central obesity) and appetite stimulation; see corticosteroid-induced lipodystrophy
* Hypercortisolemia with prolonged or excessive use (also known as, exogenous Cushing&#x27;s syndrome)
* Impaired memory and attention deficits See steroid dementia syndrome.
* Adrenal insufficiency (if used for long time and stopped suddenly without a taper)
* Muscle and tendon breakdown (proteolysis), weakness, reduced muscle mass and repair
* Expansion of malar fat pads and dilation of small blood vessels in skin
* Lipomatosis within the epidural space
* Excitatory effect on central nervous system (euphoria, psychosis)
* Anovulation, irregularity of menstrual periods
* Growth failure, delayed puberty
* Increased plasma amino acids, increased urea formation, negative nitrogen balance
* Glaucoma due to increased ocular pressure
* Cataracts
* Topical steroid withdrawal

In high doses, hydrocortisone (cortisol) and those glucocorticoids with appreciable mineralocorticoid potency can exert a mineralocorticoid effect as well, although in physiologic doses this is prevented by rapid degradation of cortisol by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoenzyme 2 () in mineralocorticoid target tissues. Mineralocorticoid effects can include salt and water retention, extracellular fluid volume expansion, hypertension, potassium depletion, and metabolic alkalosis.

===Immunodeficiency===
Glucocorticoids cause immunosuppression, decreasing the function and/or numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes (including both B cells and T cells), monocytes, macrophages, and the anatomical barrier function of the skin. This suppression, if large enough, can cause manifestations of immunodeficiency, including T cell deficiency, humoral immune deficiency and neutropenia.

===Withdrawal===
In addition to the effects listed above, use of high-dose glucocorticoids for only a few days begins to produce suppression of the patient&#x27;s adrenal glands suppressing hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) leading to suppressed production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the anterior pituitary. With prolonged suppression, the adrenal glands atrophy (physically shrink), and can take months to recover full function after discontinuation of the exogenous glucocorticoid.

During this recovery time, the patient is vulnerable to adrenal insufficiency during times of stress, such as illness. While suppressive dose and time for adrenal recovery vary widely, clinical guidelines have been devised to estimate potential adrenal suppression and recovery, to reduce risk to the patient. The following is one example:
* If patients have been receiving daily high doses for five days or less, they can be abruptly stopped (or reduced to physiologic replacement if patients are adrenal-deficient). Full adrenal recovery can be assumed to occur by a week afterward.
* If high doses were used for six to 10 days, reduce to replacement dose immediately and taper over four more days. Adrenal recovery can be assumed to occur within two to four weeks of completion of steroids.
* If high doses were used for 11–30 days, cut immediately to twice replacement, and then by 25% every four days. Stop entirely when dose is less than half of replacement. Full adrenal recovery should occur within one to three months of completion of withdrawal.
* If high doses were used more than 30 days, cut dose immediately to twice replacement, and reduce by 25% each week until replacement is reached. Then change to oral hydrocortisone or cortisone as a single morning dose, and gradually decrease by 2.5 mg each week. When the morning dose is less than replacement, the return of normal basal adrenal function may be documented by checking 0800 cortisol levels prior to the morning dose; stop drugs when 0800 cortisol is 10 μg/dl. Predicting the time to full adrenal recovery after prolonged suppressive exogenous steroids is difficult; some people may take nearly a year.
* Flare-up of the underlying condition for which steroids are given may require a more gradual taper than outlined above.

<text>Within personality psychology, personal construct theory (PCT) or personal construct psychology (PCP) is a theory of personality and cognition developed by the American psychologist George Kelly in the 1950s. The theory addresses the psychological reasons for actions. Kelly proposed that individuals can be psychologically evaluated according to similarity–dissimilarity poles, which he called personal constructs (schemas, or ways of seeing the world). The theory is considered by some psychologists as forerunner to theories of cognitive therapy.

From the theory, Kelly derived a psychotherapy approach, as well as a technique called &quot;the repertory grid interview&quot;, that helped his patients to analyze their own personal constructs with minimal intervention or interpretation by the therapist. The repertory grid was later adapted for various uses within organizations, including decision-making and interpretation of other people&#x27;s world-views. The UK Council for Psychotherapy, a regulatory body, classifies PCP therapy within the experiential subset of the constructivist school.

== Principles ==
A main tenet of PCP theory is that a person&#x27;s unique psychological processes are channeled by the way they anticipate events. Kelly believed that anticipation and prediction are the main drivers of our mind. &quot;Every man is, in his own particular way, a scientist&quot;, said Kelly: people are constantly building up and refining theories and models about how the world works so that they can anticipate future events. People start doing this at birth (for example, a child discovers that if they start to cry, their mother will come to them) and continue refining their theories as they grow up.

Kelly proposed that every construct is bipolar, specifying how two things are similar to each other (lying on the same pole) and different from a third thing, and they can be expanded with new ideas. (More recent researchers have suggested that constructs need not be bipolar.) People build theories—often stereotypes—about other people and also try to control them or impose on others their own theories so as to be better able to predict others&#x27; actions. All these theories are built up from a system of constructs. A construct has two extreme points, such as &quot;happy–sad,&quot; and people tend to place items at either extreme or at some point in between. People&#x27;s minds, said Kelly, are filled up with these constructs at a low level of awareness.

A given person, set of persons, any event, or circumstance can be characterized fairly precisely by the set of constructs applied to it and by the position of the thing within the range of each construct. For example, Fred may feel as though he is not happy or sad (an example of a construct); he feels as though he is between the two. However, he feels he is more clever than he is stupid (another example of a construct).  A baby may have a preverbal construct of what behaviors may cause their mother to come to them. Constructs can be applied to anything people put their attention to, and constructs also strongly influence what people fix their attention on. People can construe reality by constructing different constructs. Hence, determining a person&#x27;s system of constructs would go a long way towards understanding them, especially the person&#x27;s essential constructs that represent their very strong and unchangeable beliefs and their self-construal.

Kelly did not use the concept of the unconscious; instead, he proposed the notion of &quot;levels of awareness&quot; to explain why people did what they did. He identified &quot;construing&quot; as the highest level and &quot;preverbal&quot; as the lowest level of awareness.

Some psychologists have suggested that PCT is not a psychological theory but a metatheory because it is a theory about theories.

== Therapy approach ==
Kelly believed in a non-invasive or non-directive approach to psychotherapy. Rather than having the therapist interpret the person&#x27;s psyche, which would amount to imposing the doctor&#x27;s constructs on the patient, the therapist should just act as a facilitator of the patient finding their own constructs. The patient&#x27;s behavior is then mainly explained as ways to selectively observe the world, act upon it and update the construct system in such a way as to increase predictability. To help the patient find their constructs, Kelly developed the repertory grid interview technique.

Kelly explicitly stated that each individual&#x27;s task in understanding their personal psychology is to put in order the facts of their own experience. Then the individual, like the scientist, is to test the accuracy of that constructed knowledge by performing those actions the constructs suggest. If the results of their actions are in line with what the knowledge predicted, then they have done a good job of finding the order in their personal experience. If not, then they can modify the construct: their interpretations or their predictions or both. This method of discovering and correcting constructs is roughly analogous to the general scientific method that is applied in various ways by modern sciences to discover truths about the universe.

== The repertory grid ==

The repertory grid serves as part of various assessment methods to elicit and examine an individual&#x27;s repertoire of personal constructs. There are different formats such as card sorts, verbally administered group format, and the repertory grid technique.

The repertory grid itself is a matrix where the rows represent constructs found, the columns represent the elements, and cells indicate with a number the position of each element within each construct. There is software available to produce several reports and graphs from these grids.

To build a repertory grid for a patient, Kelly might first ask the patient to select about seven elements (although there are no fixed rules for the number of elements) whose nature might depend on whatever the patient or therapist are trying to discover. For instance, &quot;Two specific friends, two work-mates, two people you dislike, your mother and yourself&quot;, or something of that sort. Then, three of the elements would be selected at random, and then the therapist would ask: &quot;In relation to ... (whatever is of interest), in which way are two of these people alike but different from the third?&quot; The answer is sure to indicate one of the extreme points of one of the patient&#x27;s constructs. He might say for instance that Fred and Sarah are very communicative whereas John isn&#x27;t. Further questioning would reveal the other end of the construct (say, introvert) and the positions of the three characters between extremes. Repeating the procedure with different sets of three elements ends up revealing several constructs the patient might not have been fully aware of.

In the book &quot;Personal Construct Methodology&quot;, researchers Brian R. Gaines and Mildred L.G. Shaw noted that they &quot;have also found concept mapping and semantic network tools to be complementary to repertory grid tools and generally use both in most studies&quot; but that they &quot;see less use of network representations in PCP studies than is appropriate&quot;. They encouraged practitioners to use semantic network techniques in addition to the repertory grid.

=== Organizational applications ===
PCP has always been a minority interest among psychologists. During the last 30 years, it has gradually gained adherents in the US, Canada, the UK, Germany, Australia, Ireland, Italy and Spain. While its chief fields of application remain clinical and educational psychology, there is an increasing interest in its applications to organizational development, employee training and development, job analysis, job description and evaluation. The repertory grid is often used in the qualitative phase of market research, to identify the ways in which consumers construe products and services.

<text>Mineralocorticoids are a class of corticosteroids, which in turn are a class of steroid hormones. Mineralocorticoids are produced in the adrenal cortex and influence salt and water balances (electrolyte balance and fluid balance). The primary mineralocorticoid is aldosterone.

==Physiology==
The name mineralocorticoid derives from early observations that these hormones were involved in the retention of sodium, a mineral. The primary endogenous mineralocorticoid is aldosterone, although a number of other endogenous hormones (including progesterone and deoxycorticosterone) have mineralocorticoid function.

Aldosterone acts on the kidneys to provide active reabsorption of sodium and an associated passive reabsorption of water, as well as the active secretion of potassium in the principal cells of the cortical collecting tubule and active secretion of protons via proton ATPases in the lumenal membrane of the intercalated cells of the collecting tubule. This in turn results in an increase of blood pressure and blood volume.

Aldosterone is produced in the zona glomerulosa of the cortex of the adrenal gland and its secretion is mediated principally by angiotensin II but also by adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and local potassium levels.

==Mode of action==
The effects of mineralocorticoids are mediated by slow genomic mechanisms through nuclear receptors as well as by fast nongenomic mechanisms through membrane-associated receptors and signaling cascades.

===Genomic mechanisms===
Mineralocorticoids bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor in the cell cytosol, and are able to freely cross the lipid bilayer of the cell. This type of receptor becomes activated upon ligand binding. After a hormone binds to the corresponding receptor, the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many hormone response elements (HREs) in the promoter region of the target genes in the DNA.

The opposite mechanism is called transrepression. The hormone receptor without ligand binding interacts with heat shock proteins and prevents the transcription of targeted genes.

Aldosterone and cortisol (a glucosteroid) have similar affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor; however, glucocorticoids circulate at roughly 100 times the level of mineralocorticoids. An enzyme exists in mineralocorticoid target tissues to prevent overstimulation by glucocorticoids. This enzyme, 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II (), catalyzes the deactivation of glucocorticoids to 11-dehydro metabolites. Licorice is known to be an inhibitor of this enzyme and chronic consumption can result in a condition known as pseudohyperaldosteronism.

==Pathophysiology==
Hyperaldosteronism (the syndrome caused by elevated aldosterone) is commonly caused by either idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia or by an adrenal adenoma. The two main resulting problems:

# Hypertension and edema due to excessive Na+ and water retention.
# Accelerated excretion of potassium ions (K+). With extreme K+ loss there is muscle weakness and eventually paralysis.

Hypoaldosteronism (the syndrome caused by underproduction of aldosterone) leads to the salt-wasting state associated with Addison&#x27;s disease, although classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia and other disease states may also cause this situation. Acute underproduction (hemorrhagic adrenalitis) is often life-threatening.

==Pharmacology==
An example of a synthetic mineralocorticoid is fludrocortisone (Florinef).

Important antimineralocorticoids are spironolactone and eplerenone.

<text>Harald Tandrup (31 January 1874 in Copenhagen – 10 May 1964) was a Danish writer. He used the pseudonyms &quot;Claus Colding&quot; or &quot;Klavs Kolding&quot;.

His first novel was entitled &quot;Ain-Mokra&quot; and appeared 1900. He also wrote &quot;Reluctant Prophet&quot; (first U.S. edition in 1939).

His novella &quot;En Eneste Natt&quot; was adapted into the Swedish 1939 film &quot;En Enda Nataa&quot;, starring Ingrid Bergman.

In 1946 he was excluded from the Danish Writer&#x27;s Association (&quot;Danske Dramatikeres Forbund&quot;), possibly for his Nazi collaboration. He had written for a Nazi newspaper and &quot;scandalously&quot; asserted that the Soviet Army had perpetrated the Katyn massacre, rather than the popular assumption in the 1940s that the Nazis were responsible; decades later he was proven correct.

<text>Muscle memory is a form of procedural memory that involves consolidating a specific motor task into memory through repetition, which has been used synonymously with motor learning. When a movement is repeated over time, the brain creates a long-term muscle memory for that task, eventually allowing it to be performed with little to no conscious effort. This process decreases the need for attention and creates maximum efficiency within the motor and memory systems. Muscle memory is found in many everyday activities that become automatic and improve with practice, such as riding bikes, driving motor vehicles, playing ball sports, typing on keyboards, entering PINs, playing musical instruments, poker, martial arts, swimming, dancing, and drawing.

== History ==

The origins of research for the acquisition of motor skills stem from philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle and Galen. After the break from tradition of the pre-1900s view of introspection, psychologists emphasized research and more scientific methods in observing behaviours. Thereafter, numerous studies exploring the role of motor learning were conducted. Such studies included the research of handwriting, and various practice methods to maximize motor learning.

=== Retention ===
The retention of motor skills, now referred to as muscle memory, also began to be of great interest in the early 1900s. Most motor skills are thought to be acquired through practice; however, more observation of the skill has led to learning as well. Research suggests we do not start off with a blank slate with regard to motor memory although we do learn most of our motor memory repertoire during our lifetime. Movements such as facial expressions, which are thought to be learned, can actually be observed in children who are blind; thus there is some evidence for motor memory being genetically pre-wired.

In the early stages of empirical research of motor memory Edward Thorndike, a leading pioneer in the study of motor memory, was among the first to acknowledge learning can occur without conscious awareness. One of the earliest and most notable studies regarding the retention of motor skills was by Hill, Rejall, and Thorndike, who showed savings in relearning typing skills after a 25-year period with no practice. Findings related to the retention of learned motor skills have been continuously replicated in studies, suggesting that through subsequent practice, motor learning is stored in the brain as memory. This is why performing skills such as riding a bike or driving a car are effortlessly and &#x27;subconsciously&#x27; executed, even if someone had not performed these skills in a long period of time.

==Physiology==

===Motor behavior===
When first learning a motor task, movement is often slow, stiff and easily disrupted without attention. With practice, execution of motor task becomes smoother, there is a decrease in limb stiffness, and muscle activity, necessary to the task, is performed without conscious effort.

===Muscle memory encoding===

The neuroanatomy of memory is widespread throughout the brain; however, the pathways important to motor memory are separate from the medial temporal lobe pathways associated with declarative memory. As with declarative memory, motor memory is theorized to have two stages: a short-term memory encoding stage, which is fragile and susceptible to damage, and a long-term memory consolidation stage, which is more stable. 
The memory encoding stage is often referred to as motor learning, and requires an increase in brain activity in motor areas as well as an increase in attention. Brain areas active during motor learning include the motor and somatosensory cortices; however, these areas of activation decrease once the motor skill is learned. The prefrontal and frontal cortices are also active during this stage due to the need for increased attention on the task being learned.

The main area involved in motor learning is the cerebellum. Some models of cerebellar-dependent motor learning, in particular the Marr-Albus model, propose a single plasticity mechanism involving the cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) of the parallel fiber synapses onto Purkinje cells. These modifications in synapse activity would mediate motor input with motor outputs critical to inducing motor learning. However, conflicting evidence suggests that a single plasticity mechanism is not sufficient and a multiple plasticity mechanism are needed to account for the storage of motor memories over time. Regardless of the mechanism, studies of cerebellar-dependent motor tasks show that cerebral cortical plasticity is crucial for motor learning, even if not necessarily for storage.

The basal ganglia also play an important role in memory and learning, in particular in reference to stimulus-response associations and the formation of habits. The basal ganglia-cerebellar connections are thought to increase with time when learning a motor task.

===Muscle memory consolidation===
Muscle memory consolidation involves the continuous evolution of neural processes after practicing a task has stopped. The exact mechanism of motor memory consolidation within the brain is controversial. However, most theories assume that there is a general redistribution of information across the brain from encoding to consolidation. Hebb&#x27;s rule states that &quot;synaptic connectivity changes as a function of repetitive firing.&quot; In this case, that would mean that the high amount of stimulation coming from practicing a movement would cause the repetition of firing in certain motor networks, presumably leading to an increase in the efficiency of exciting these motor networks over time.

While the exact location of muscle memory storage is not known, studies have suggested that it is the inter-regional connections that play the most important role in advancing motor memory encoding to consolidation, rather than decreases in overall regional activity. These studies have shown a weakened connection from the cerebellum to the primary motor area with practice, it is presumed, because of a decreased need for error correction from the cerebellum. However, the connection between the basal ganglia and the primary motor area is strengthened, suggesting the basal ganglia play an important role in the motor memory consolidation process.

===Strength training and adaptations===

When participating in any sport, new motor skills and movement combinations are frequently being used and repeated. All sports require some degree of strength, endurance training, and skilled reaching in order to be successful in the required tasks. Muscle memory related to strength training involves elements of both motor learning, described below, and long-lasting changes in the muscle tissue.

Evidence has shown that increases in strength occur well before muscle hypertrophy, and decreases in strength due to detraining or ceasing to repeat the exercise over an extended period of time precede muscle atrophy. To be specific, strength training enhances motor neuron excitability and induces synaptogenesis, both of which would help in enhancing communication between the nervous system and the muscles themselves. However, neuromuscular efficacy is not altered within a two-week time period following cessation of the muscle usage; instead, it is merely the neuron&#x27;s ability to excite the muscle that declines in correlation with the muscle&#x27;s decrease in strength. This confirms that muscle strength is first influenced by the inner neural circuitry, rather than by external physiological changes in the muscle size.

Previously untrained muscles will acquire newly formed nuclei through the fusion of satellite cells preceding hypertrophy. Subsequent detraining will result in atrophy and the loss of myo-nuclei. While it was long believed that a muscle memory effect related to myo-nuclei permanence existed, current studies establish that during detraining, myo-nuclei will be lost.

Reorganization of motor maps within the cortex are not altered in either strength or endurance training. However, within the motor cortex, endurance induces angiogenesis within as little as three weeks to increase blood flow to the involved regions. In addition, neurotropic factors within the motor cortex are upregulated in response to endurance training to promote neural survival.

Skilled motor tasks have been divided into two distinct phases: a fast-learning phase, in which an optimal plan for performance is established, and a slow-learning phase, in which longer-term structural modifications are made on specific motor modules. Even a small amount of training may be enough to induce neural processes that continue to evolve even after the training has stopped, which provides a potential basis for consolidation of the task. In addition, studying mice while they are learning a new complex reaching task, has found that &quot;motor learning leads to rapid formation of dendritic spines (spinogenesis) in the motor cortex contralateral to the reaching forelimb&quot;. However, motor cortex reorganization itself does not occur at a uniform rate across training periods. It has been suggested that the synaptogenesis and motor map reorganization merely represent the consolidation, and not the acquisition itself, of a specific motor task. Furthermore, the degree of plasticity in various locations (namely motor cortex versus spinal cord) is dependent on the behavioural demands and nature of the task (i.e., skilled reaching versus strength training).

Whether strength or endurance related, it is plausible that the majority of motor movements would require a skilled moving task of some form, whether it be maintaining proper form when paddling a canoe, sitting with a neutral posture, or bench pressing a heavier weight. Endurance training assists the formation of these new neural representations within the motor cortex by up regulating neurotropic factors that could enhance the survival of the newer neural maps formed due to the skilled movement training. Strength training results are seen in the spinal cord well before any physiological muscular adaptation is established through muscle hypertrophy or atrophy. The results of endurance and strength training, and skilled reaching, therefore, combine to help each other maximize performance output.

More recently, research has suggested that epigenetics may play a distinct role in orchestrating a muscle memory phenomenon Indeed, previously untrained human participants experienced a chronic period of resistance exercise training (7 weeks) that evoked significant increases in skeletal muscle mass of the vastus lateralis muscle, in the quadriceps muscle group. Following a similar period of physical in-activity (7 weeks), where strength and muscle mass returned to baseline, participants performed a secondary period of resistance exercise. Importantly, these participants adapted in an enhanced manner, whereby the amount of skeletal muscle mass gained was greater in the second period of muscle growth than the first, suggesting a muscle memory concept. The researchers went on to examine the human epigenome in order to understand how DNA methylation may aid in creating this effect. During the first period of resistance exercise, the authors identify significant adaptations in the human methylome, whereby over 9,000 CpG sites were reported as being significantly hypomethylated, with these adaptations being sustained during the subsequent period of physical in-activity. However, upon secondary exposure to resistance exercise, a greater frequency of hypomethylated CpG sites was observed, where over 18,000 sites reported as being significantly hypomethylated. The authors went on to identify how these changes altered the expression of relevant transcripts, and subsequently correlated these changes with adaptations in skeletal muscle mass. Collectively, the authors conclude that skeletal muscle mass and muscle memory phenomenon is, at least in part, modulated due to changes in DNA methylation. Further work is now needed to confirm and explore these findings.

==Fine motor memory==

Fine motor skills are often discussed in terms of transitive movements, which are those done when using tools (which could be as simple as a tooth brush or pencil). Transitive movements have representations that become programmed to the premotor cortex, creating motor programs that result in the activation of the motor cortex and therefore the motor movements. In a study testing the motor memory of patterned finger movements (a fine motor skill) it was found that retention of certain skills is susceptible to disruption if another task interferes with one&#x27;s motor memory. However, such susceptibility can be reduced with time. For example, if a finger pattern is learned and another finger pattern is learned six hours later, the first pattern will still be remembered. But attempting to learn two such patterns one immediately after the other could cause the first one to be forgotten. Furthermore, the heavy use of computers by recent generations has had both positive and negative effects. One of the main positive effects is an enhancement of children&#x27;s fine motor skills. Repetitive behaviors, such as typing on a computer from a young age, can enhance such abilities. Therefore, children who learn to use computer keyboards at an early age could benefit from the early muscle memories.

===Music memory===
Fine motor skills are very important in playing musical instruments. It was found that muscle memory is relied on when playing the clarinet, specifically to help create special effects through certain tongue movements when blowing air into the instrument.

Certain human behaviours, especially actions like the finger movements in musical performances, are very complex and require many interconnected neural networks where information can be transmitted across multiple brain regions. It has been found that there are often functional differences in the brains of professional musicians, when compared to other individuals. This is thought to reflect the musician&#x27;s innate ability, which may be fostered by an early exposure to musical training. An example of this is bimanual synchronized finger movements, which play an essential role in piano playing. It is suggested that bimanual coordination can come only from years of bimanual training, where such actions become adaptations of the motor areas. When comparing professional musicians to a control group in complex bimanual movements, professionals are found to use an extensive motor network much less than those non-professionals. This is because professionals rely on a motor system that has increased efficiency, and, therefore, those less trained have a network that is more strongly activated. It is implied that the untrained pianists have to invest more neuronal activity to have the same level of performance that is achieved by professionals. This, yet again, is said to be a consequence of many years of motor training and experience that helps form a fine motor memory skill of musical performance.

It is often reported that, when a pianist hears a well-trained piece of music, synonymous fingering can be involuntarily triggered. This implies that there is a coupling between the perception of music and the motor activity of those musically trained individuals. Therefore, one&#x27;s muscle memory in the context of music can easily be triggered when one hears certain familiar pieces. Overall, long-term musical fine motor training allows for complex actions to be performed at a lower level of movement control, monitoring, selection, attention, and timing. This leaves room for musicians to focus attention synchronously elsewhere, such as on the artistic aspect of the performance, without having to consciously control one&#x27;s fine motor actions.

===Puzzle cube memory===
Speed cubers use muscle memory when attempting to solve puzzle cubes, such as the Rubik&#x27;s Cube, in the fastest possible time. Solving these puzzles in an optimally efficient manner requires the cube to be manipulated according to a set of complex algorithms. By building their muscle memory of each algorithm&#x27;s movements, speed cubers can implement them at very fast speeds without conscious effort. This plays a role in major speedcubing methods such as Fridrich for the 3×3×3 Rubik&#x27;s Cube and EG for the 2×2×2 Pocket Cube.

== Gross motor memory ==
Gross motor skills are concerned with the movement of large muscles, or major body movements, such as those involved in walking or kicking, and are associated with normal development. The extent to which one exhibits gross motor skills depends largely on their muscle tone and the strength. In a study looking at people with Down Syndrome, it was found that the pre-existing deficits, with regard to verbal-motor performance, limits the individual&#x27;s transfer of gross motor skills following visual and verbal instruction to verbal instruction only. The fact that the individuals could still exhibit two of the three original motor skills may have been a result of positive transfer in which previous exposure allows the individual to remember the motion, under the visual and verbal trial, and then later perform it under the verbal trial.

=== Learning in childhood ===
The way in which a child learns a gross motor skill can affect how long it takes to consolidate it and be able to reproduce the movement. In a study with preschoolers, looking at the role of self-instruction on acquiring complex gross motor chains using ballet positions, it was found that the motor skills were better learned and remembered with the self-instruction procedure over the no-self-instruction procedure. This suggests that the use of self-instruction will increase the speed with which a preschooler will learn and remember a gross motor skill. It was also found that once the preschoolers learned and mastered the motor chain movements, they ceased the use of self-instruction. This suggests that the memory for the movements became strong enough that there was no longer a need for self-instruction and the movements could be reproduced without it.

=== Effect of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ===
It has been suggested that consistent practice of a gross motor skill can help a patient with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease learn and remember that skill. It was thought that the damage to the hippocampus may result in the need for a specific type of learning requirement. A study was created to test this assumption in which the patients were trained to throw a bean bag at a target. It was found that the Alzheimer&#x27;s patients performed better on the task when learning occurred under constant training as opposed to variable. Also, it was found that gross motor memory in Alzheimer&#x27;s patients was the same as that of healthy adults when learning occurs under constant practice. This suggests that damage to the hippocampal system does not impair an Alzheimer&#x27;s patient from retaining new gross motor skills, implying that motor memory for gross motor skills is stored elsewhere in the brain. However there isn&#x27;t much evidence provided on this.

== Impairment ==
It is difficult to display cases of &quot;pure&quot; motor memory impairment because the memory system is so widespread throughout the brain that damage is not often isolated to one specific type of memory. Likewise, diseases commonly associated with motor deficits, such as Huntington&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s disease, have a wide variety of symptoms and associated brain damage that make it impossible to pinpoint whether or not motor memory is in fact impaired. Case studies have provided some examples of how motor memory has been implemented in patients with brain damage.

As Edward S. Casey notes in Remembering, Second Edition: A Phenomenological Study, declarative memory, a process that involves an initial fragile learning period. &quot;The activity of the past, in short, resides in its habitual enactment in the present.&quot;

=== Consolidation deficit ===
A recent issue in motor memory is whether or not it consolidates in a manner similar to declarative memory, a process that involves an initial fragile learning period that eventually becomes stable and less susceptible to damage over time. An example of stable motor memory consolidation in a patient with brain damage is the case of Clive Wearing. Clive has severe anterograde and retrograde amnesia owing to damage in his temporal lobes, frontal lobes, and hippocampi, which prevents him from storing any new memories and making him aware of only the present moment. However, Clive still retains access to his procedural memories, to be specific, the motor memories involved in playing the piano. This could be because motor memory is demonstrated through savings over several trials of learning, whereas declarative memory is demonstrated through recall of a single item. This suggests that lesions in certain brain areas normally associated with declarative memory would not affect motor memory for a well-learned skill.

=== Dysgraphia for the alphabet ===
Case study: 54-year-old man with known history of epilepsy
This patient was diagnosed with a pure form of dysgraphia of letters, meaning he had no other speech or reading impairments. His impairment was specific to letters in the alphabet. He was able to copy letters from the alphabet, but he was not able to write these letters. He had previously been rated average on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale&#x27;s vocabulary subtest for writing ability comparative to his age before his diagnosis. His writing impairment consisted of difficulty remembering motor movements associated with the letters he was supposed to write. He was able to copy the letters, and also form images that were similar to the letters. This suggests that dysgraphia for letters is a deficit related to motor memory. Somehow there is a distinct process within the brain related to writing letters, which is dissociated from copying and drawing letter-like items.

<text>Rafael Joseffy (July 3, 1852 – June 25, 1915) was a Hungarian Jewish pianist, teacher and composer.

==Life==

Rafael Joseffy was born in Hunfalu, Szepes County
(now Huncovce, Slovakia) in 1852. His youth was spent in Miskolc, and he began his study of the piano there at the age of eight. He studied in Budapest with Friedrich Brauer, the teacher of Stephen Heller. In 1866, he went to Leipzig, where his teachers were Ignaz Moscheles and Ernst Ferdinand Wenzel. In 1868, he became a pupil of Karl Tausig in Berlin, remaining with him for two years. Later he spent two summers with Franz Liszt in Weimar. He made his debut in Berlin in 1872 and was immediately acclaimed as a master pianist of great brilliance.

He moved to the United States in 1879, where he lived in New York City. Joseffy made his American debut in New York in 1879, with an orchestra under Leopold Damrosch. He soon after played with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, and subsequently made many appearances in New York and other American cities with Theodore Thomas and the Theodore Thomas Orchestra. 

Joseffy was soloist for the inaugural concerts of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on October 16 and 17, 1891, performing Tchaikovsky&#x27;s First Piano Concerto with Thomas conducting at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago.

Joseffy produced numerous popular compositions for the piano as well as editing works of Frédéric Chopin and other composers for G. Schirmer music publishers. Several of his songs were translated from German to English by Helen Tretbar. 

Later in life he virtually retired from the concert platform and devoted his attention to teaching His students included the American composer and singer Florence Turner-Maley. He was a very reserved man. Henry Wolfsohn claimed to have offered Joseffy huge sums for concert tours but the pianist found concert life so severe upon his nerves that he would not accept. He preferred the smaller income of a teacher to the glare of the footlights. While in New York, he spent his summers in Tarrytown. He died in New York City in 1915, aged 62.

<text>A residual-current device (RCD), residual-current circuit breaker (RCCB) or ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) is an electrical safety device, more specifically a form of Earth-leakage circuit breaker, that interrupts an electrical circuit when the current passing through and neutral conductors of a circuit is not equal (the term &quot;residual&quot; relating to the imbalance), therefore indicating current leaking to ground, or to an unintended path that bypasses the protective device. The device&#x27;s purpose is to reduce the severity of injury caused by an electric shock. This type of circuit interrupter cannot protect a person who touches both circuit conductors at the same time, since it then cannot distinguish normal current from that passing through a person.

A [[Residual-current device|residual-current circuit breaker with integrated overcurrent protection]] ([[Residual-current device|RCBO]]) combines RCD protection with additional overcurrent protection into the same device.

These devices are designed to quickly interrupt the protected circuit when it detects that the electric current is unbalanced between the supply and return conductors of the circuit. Any difference between the currents in these conductors indicates leakage current, which presents a shock hazard. Alternating 60 Hz current above 20 mA (0.020 amperes) through the human body is potentially sufficient to cause cardiac arrest or serious harm if it persists for more than a small fraction of a second. RCDs are designed to disconnect the conducting wires (&quot;trip&quot;) quickly enough to potentially prevent serious injury to humans, and to prevent damage to electrical devices.

==Purpose and operation==

RCDs are designed to disconnect the circuit if there is a leakage current. In their first implementation in the 1950s, power companies used them to prevent electricity theft where consumers grounded returning circuits rather than connecting them to neutral to inhibit electrical meters from registering their power consumption.

The most common modern application is as a safety device to detect small leakage currents (typically 5–30mA) and disconnecting quickly enough (&lt;30 milliseconds) to prevent device damage or electrocution. They are an essential part of the automatic disconnection of supply (ADS), i.e. to switch off when a fault develops, rather than rely on human intervention, one of the essential tenets of modern electrical practice.

To reduce the risk of electrocution, RCDs should operate within 25–40 milliseconds with any leakage currents (through a person) of greater than 30mA, before electric shock can drive the heart into ventricular fibrillation, the most common cause of death through electric shock. By contrast, conventional circuit breakers or fuses only break the circuit when the total current is excessive (which may be thousands of times the leakage current an RCD responds to). A small leakage current, such as through a person, can be a very serious fault, but does not increase the total current enough for a fuse or overload circuit breaker to isolate the circuit.

RCDs operate by measuring the current balance between two conductors using a differential current transformer. This measures the difference between current flowing through and neutral. If these do not sum to zero, there is a leakage of current to somewhere else (to Earth/ground or to another circuit), and the device will open its contacts. Operation does not require a fault current to return through the earth wire in the installation; the trip will operate just as well if the return path is through plumbing or contact with the ground or anything else. Automatic disconnection and a measure of shock protection is therefore still provided even if the earth wiring of the installation is damaged or incomplete.

RCDs are testable and resettable devices—a test button safely creates a small leakage condition, and another button, or switch, resets the conductors after a fault condition has been cleared. Some RCDs disconnect both the and neutral conductors upon a fault (double pole), while a single pole RCD only disconnects the conductor. If the fault has left the neutral wire &quot;floating&quot; or not at its expected ground potential for any reason, then a single-pole RCD will leave this conductor still connected to the circuit when it detects the fault.

For an RCD used with three-phase power, all three conductors and the neutral (if fitted) must pass through the current transformer.

==Application==
Electrical plugs with incorporated RCD are sometimes installed on appliances that might be considered to pose a particular safety hazard, for example long extension leads, which might be used outdoors, or garden equipment or hair dryers, which may be used near a bath or sink. Occasionally an in-line RCD may be used to serve a similar function to one in a plug. By putting the RCD in the extension lead, protection is provided at whatever outlet is used even if the building has old wiring, such as knob and tube, or wiring that does not contain a grounding conductor. The in-line RCD can also have a lower tripping threshold than the building to further improve safety for a specific electrical device.

In North America, GFI receptacles can be used in cases where there is no grounding conductor, but they must be labeled as &quot;no equipment ground&quot;. This is referenced in the National Electric Code section 406 (D) 2, however codes change and someone should always consult a licensed professional and their local building and safety departments. The code is An ungrounded GFI receptacle will trip using the built-in &quot;test&quot; button, but will not trip using a GFI test plug, because the plug tests by passing a small current from to the non-existent ground. It is worth noting that despite this, only one GFCI receptacle at the beginning of each circuit is necessary to protect downstream receptacles. There does not appear to be a risk of using multiple GFI receptacles on the same circuit, though it is considered redundant.

In Europe, RCDs can fit on the same DIN rail as the miniature circuit breakers; much like in miniature circuit breakers, the busbar arrangements in consumer units and distribution boards provides protection for anything downstream.

==RCBO==
A pure RCD will detect imbalance in the currents of the supply and return conductors of a circuit. But it cannot protect against overload or short circuit like a fuse or a miniature circuit breaker (MCB) does (except for the special case of a short circuit from to ground, not to neutral).

However, an RCD and an MCB often come integrated in the same device, thus being able to detect both supply imbalance and overload current. Such a device is called an &quot;RCBO&quot;, for &quot;residual-current circuit breaker with overcurrent protection&quot;, in Europe and Australia, and a &quot;GFCI breaker&quot;, for &quot;ground fault circuit interrupter&quot;, in the United States and Canada.

==Typical design==
The diagram depicts the internal mechanism of a residual-current device (RCD). The device is designed to be wired in-line in an appliance power cord. It is rated to carry a maximal current of 13A and is designed to trip on a leakage current of 30mA. This is an active RCD; that is, it latches electrically and therefore trips on power failure, a useful feature for equipment that could be dangerous on unexpected re-energisation. Some early RCDs were entirely electromechanical and relied on finely balanced sprung over-centre mechanisms driven directly from the current transformer. As these are hard to manufacture to the required accuracy and prone to drift in sensitivity both from pivot wear and lubricant dry-out, the electronically-amplified type with a more robust solenoid part as illustrated are now dominant.

In the internal mechanism of an RCD, the incoming supply and the neutral conductors are connected to the terminals at (1), and the outgoing load conductors are connected to the terminals at (2). The earth conductor (not shown) is connected through from supply to load uninterrupted.
When the reset button (3) is pressed, the contacts ((4) and another, hidden behind (5)) close, allowing current to pass. The solenoid (5) keeps the contacts closed when the reset button is released.

The sense coil (6) is a differential current transformer which surrounds (but is not electrically connected to) the and neutral conductors. In normal operation, all the current flows in and out of the and neutral conductors. The amount of current in the two conductors is equal and opposite and cancel each other out.

Any fault to earth (for example caused by a person touching a live component in the attached appliance) causes some of the current to take a different path, with some of the neutral current diverted, which means that there is then an imbalance in the current between the and neutral conductors (single-phase), or, more generally a nonzero sum of currents from among various conductors (for example, three phase conductors and one neutral conductor), within the RCD.

This difference causes a magnetic flux in the toroidal sense coil (6), which, if sufficiently large, activates the relay (5), causing the switch to activate forcing the contacts (4) apart and thus cutting off the electricity supply to the appliance. In some designs a power failure may also cause the switch contacts to open, causing the safe trip-on-power-failure behaviour mentioned above.

The test button (8) allows the correct operation of the device to be verified by passing a small current through the orange test wire (9). This simulates a fault by creating a deliberate imbalance in the sense coil. If the RCD does not trip when this button is pressed, then the device must be replaced.
=== RCD with integral overcurrent protection (RCBO) ===

Residual-current and over-current protection may be combined in one device. Such a device is termed an RCBO (residual-current circuit breaker with over-current protection). In the US and Canada such devices (in the form of circuit breakers) are known by the term &quot;GFCI circuit breaker&quot; (lacking an American-specific acronym for this combination and seemingly taking for granted the presence of over-current protection in any circuit breaker type device). They are effectively a combination of a RCD and a MCB.

As well as requiring both and neutral inputs and outputs (or, full three-phase), some RCDs/GFCIs require a functional earth (FE) connection. This serves to provide both EMC immunity and to reliably operate the device if the input-side neutral connection is lost but and earth remain.

For reasons of space, many devices, especially in DIN rail format, use flying leads rather than screw terminals, especially for the neutral input and FE connections. Additionally, because of the small form factor, the output cables of some models (Eaton/MEM) are used to form the primary winding of the RCD part, and the outgoing circuit cables must be led through a specially dimensioned terminal tunnel with the current transformer part around it. This can lead to incorrect failed trip results when testing with meter probes from the screw heads of the terminals, rather than from the final circuit wiring.

Having one RCD feeding another is generally unnecessary, provided they have been wired properly. One exception is the case of a TT earthing system, where the earth loop impedance may be high, meaning that a ground fault might not cause sufficient current to trip an ordinary circuit breaker or fuse. In this case a special 100mA (or greater) trip current time-delayed RCD is installed, covering the whole installation, and then more sensitive RCDs should be installed downstream of it for sockets and other circuits that are considered high-risk.

===RCD with additional arc fault protection circuitry===

In addition to ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs), arc-fault circuit interrupters (AFCI) are important as they offer added protection from potentially hazardous arc faults resulting from damage in branch circuit wiring as well as extensions to branches such as appliances and cord sets. By detecting arc faults and responding by interrupting power, AFCIs help reduce the likelihood of the home&#x27;s electrical system being an ignition source of a fire. Dual function AFCI/GFCI devices offer both electrical fire prevention and shock prevention in one device making them a solution for many rooms in the home.

==Characteristics==

===Differences in disconnection actions===
Major differences exist regarding the manner in which an RCD unit will act to disconnect the power to a circuit or appliance.

There are four situations in which different types of RCD units are used:

# At the consumer power distribution level, usually in conjunction with an RCBO resettable circuit breaker;
# Built into a wall socket;
# Plugged into a wall socket, which may be part of a power-extension cable; and
# Built into the cord of a portable appliance, such as those intended to be used in outdoor or wet areas.

The first three of those situations relate largely to usage as part of a power-distribution system and are almost always of the &quot;passive&quot; or &quot;latched&quot; variety, whereas the fourth relates solely to specific appliances and are always of the &quot;active&quot; or &quot;non-latching&quot; variety. &quot;Active&quot; means prevention of any &quot;re-activation&quot; of the power supply after any inadvertent form of power outage, as soon as the mains supply becomes re-established; &quot;latch&quot; relates to a &quot;switch&quot; inside the unit housing the RCD that remains as set following any form of power outage, but has to be reset manually after the detection of an error condition.

In the fourth situation, it would be deemed to be highly undesirable, and probably very unsafe, for a connected appliance to automatically resume operation after a power disconnection, without having the operator in attendanceas such, manual reactivation of the RCD is necessary.

The difference between the modes of operation of the essentially two different types of RCD functionality is that the operation for power distribution purposes requires the internal latch to remain set within the RCD after any form of power disconnection caused by either the user turning the power off, or after any power outage; such arrangements are particularly applicable for connections to refrigerators and freezers.

Situation two is mostly installed just as described above, but some wall socket RCDs are available to fit the fourth situation, often by operating a switch on the fascia panel.

RCDs for the first and third situation are most commonly rated at 30mA and 40ms. For the fourth situation, there is generally a greater choice of ratings availablegenerally all lower than the other forms, but lower values often result in more nuisance tripping. Sometimes users apply protection in addition to one of the other forms, when they wish to override those with a lower rating. It may be wise to have a selection of type four RCDs available, because connections made under damp conditions or using lengthy power cables are more prone to trip-out when any of the lower ratings of RCD are used; ratings as low as 10mA are available.

===Number of poles and pole terminology===
The number of poles represents the number of conductors that are interrupted when a fault condition occurs. RCDs used on single-phase AC supplies (two current paths), such as domestic power, are usually one- or two-pole designs, also known as single- and double-pole. A single-pole RCD interrupts only the energized conductor, while a double-pole RCD interrupts both the energized and return conductors. (In a single-pole RCD, the return conductor is usually anticipated to be at ground potential at all times and therefore safe on its own).

RCDs with three or more poles can be used on three-phase AC supplies (three current paths) or to disconnect the neutral conductor as well, with four-pole RCDs used to interrupt three-phase and neutral supplies. Specially designed RCDs can also be used with both AC and DC power distribution systems.

The following terms are sometimes used to describe the manner in which conductors are connected and disconnected by an RCD:
:* Single-pole or one-pole – the RCD will disconnect the energized wire only.
:* Double-pole or two-pole – the RCD will disconnect both the energized and return wires.
:* 1+N and 1P+N – non-standard terms used in the context of RCBOs, at times used differently by different manufacturers. Typically these terms may signify that the return (neutral) conductor is an isolating pole only, without a protective element (an unprotected but switched neutral), that the RCBO provides a conducting path and connectors for the return (neutral) conductor but this path remains uninterrupted when a fault occurs (sometimes known as &quot;solid neutral&quot;), or that both conductors are disconnected for some faults (such as RCD detected leakage) but only one conductor is disconnected for other faults (such as overload).

===Sensitivity===
RCD sensitivity is expressed as the rated residual operating current, noted &quot;IΔn&quot;. Preferred values have been defined by the IEC, thus making it possible to divide RCDs into three groups according to their &quot;IΔn&quot; value:
* High sensitivity: 5, 10 and 30mA (for direct-contact or life injury protection),
* Medium sensitivity: 100, 300, 500 and 1000mA (for fire protection),
* Low sensitivity: 3, 10 and 30A (typically for protection of machines).

The 5mA sensitivity is typical for GFCI outlets.

===Trip time===
Trip times are how quickly the device reacts to a fault. Devices must meet specific trip times when leakage current is sensed, with times ranging from tens to hundreds of milliseconds, as defined in national and international standards. The amount of time may vary depending upon the amount of current sensed, potentially having to react quicker to larger amounts, and to not react at all if the amount is sufficiently below the device rating.

In contrast to &quot;general&quot; types, &quot;S-type&quot; (aka &quot;time delayed&quot;) RCDs include a time delay — a minimum amount of time during which the device will not react — and typically higher maximum reaction time limits. This time delay allows for &quot;discrimination&quot; (aka &quot;selectivity&quot;) which is the principle that where two RCDs are installed in series, in the even of a fault it is desirable for the downstream device (which would typically cover a smaller portion of the installation) to trigger rather than the upstream in order to minimise how much of the electrical installation is disconnected. The upstream device should only trigger if the downstream device fails to react or if the fault is located between the two devices.

&quot;Programmable&quot; devices may be available for industrial use that can be adjusted to a range of sensitivity values and possibly response times.

===Type (types of leakage current detected)===
IEC Standard 60755 (&quot;General requirements for residual current operated protective devices&quot;) defines the following types of RCD depending on the waveforms and frequency of the fault current:
* Type AC RCDs trip on alternating sinusoidal residual current, suddenly applied or smoothly increasing.
* Type A RCDs trip on alternating sinusoidal residual current and on residual pulsating direct current, suddenly applied or smoothly increasing.
* Type F RCDs trip in the same conditions as Type A and in addition: 
** For composite residual currents, whether suddenly applied or slowly rising, intended for circuit supplied between and neutral or and earthed middle conductor;
** For residual pulsating direct currents superimposed on smooth direct current.
* Type B RCDs trip in the same conditions as Type F and in addition:
** For residual sinusoidal alternating currents up to 1kHz;
** For residual alternating currents superimposed on a smooth direct current;
** For residual pulsating direct currents superimposed on a smooth direct current;
** For residual pulsating rectified direct current which results from two or more phases; 
** For residual smooth direct currents, whether suddenly applied or slowly increased, independent of polarity.

The BEAMA RCD Handbook notes that types F and B have been introduced because some designs of types AC and A can be disabled if a DC current is present that saturates the core of the detector.

===Directionality===
RCDs may be uni-directional or bi-directional. Bi-directional devices have recently been introduced to address the problem of traditional uni-directional devices being unsuitable for certain configurations of home generation systems (PV).

===Surge current resistance===
The surge current refers to the peak current an RCD is designed to withstand using a test impulse of specified characteristics. The IEC 61008 and IEC 61009 standards require that RCDs withstand a 200A &quot;ring wave&quot; impulse. The standards also require RCDs classified as &quot;selective&quot; to withstand a 3000A impulse surge current of specified waveform.

==Testing of correct operation==

RCDs can and should be tested with a built-in test button to confirm basic functionality on a regular basis. If the switch mechanism is not operated for a long period then they can become liable to getting stuck. This is not generally a problem for an overcurrent circuit breaker because the force from the amount of current involved with those when they trip can be sufficient to break them free if stuck, however an RCD is designed to trip on a very small amount of current which can excerpt far too weak a force to break a stuck switch free, thus failing to operate the safety device. By operating the test button on a regular basis it can be seen whether or not a device is getting stuck. If so then manually operating the switch a few times may free it up temporarily and replacement can be considered. More thorough testing performed by a suitably competent person as part of a periodic test of an electrical installation might include checking what amount of current is required to make each device trip, and how quickly they trip, to check that they are performing within specification.

==Limitations==
A residual-current circuit breaker cannot remove all risk of electric shock or fire. In particular, an RCD alone will not detect overload conditions, phase-to-neutral short circuits or phase-to-phase short circuits (see three-phase electric power). Over-current protection (fuses or circuit breakers) must be provided. Circuit breakers that combine the functions of an RCD with overcurrent protection respond to both types of fault. These are known as RCBOs and are available in 2-, 3- and 4-pole configurations. RCBOs will typically have separate circuits for detecting current imbalance and for overload current but use a common interrupting mechanism. Some RCBOs have separate levers for residual-current and over-current protection or use a separate indicator for ground faults.

An RCD helps to protect against electric shock when current flows through a person from a phase ( / hot) to earth. It cannot protect against electric shock when current flows through a person from phase to neutral or from phase to phase, for example where a finger touches both and neutral contacts in a light fitting; a device cannot differentiate between current flow through an intended load from flow through a person, though the RCD may still trip if the person is in contact with the ground (earth), as some current may still pass through the persons finger and body to earth.

Whole installations on a single RCD, common in older installations in the UK, are prone to &quot;nuisance&quot; trips that can cause secondary safety problems with loss of lighting and defrosting of food. Frequently the trips are caused by deteriorating insulation on heater elements, such as water heaters and cooker elements or rings. Although regarded as a nuisance, the fault is with the deteriorated element and not the RCD: replacement of the offending element will resolve the problem, but replacing the RCD will not.

RCDs are not selective, for example when a ground fault occurs on a circuit protected by a 30 mA IΔn RCD in series with a 300 mA IΔn RCD either or both may trip. Special time-delayed types are available to provide selectivity in such installations.

In the case of RCDs that need a power supply, a dangerous condition can arise if the neutral wire is broken or switched off on the supply side of the RCD, while the corresponding conductor remains uninterrupted. The tripping circuit needs power to work and does not trip when the power supply fails. Connected equipment will not work without a neutral, but the RCD cannot protect people from contact with the energized wire. For this reason circuit breakers must be installed in a way that ensures that the neutral wire cannot be switched off unless the conductor is also switched off at the same time. Where there is a requirement for switching off the neutral wire, two-pole breakers (or four-pole for 3-phase) must be used. To provide some protection with an interrupted neutral, some RCDs and RCBOs are equipped with an auxiliary connection wire that must be connected to the earth busbar of the distribution board. This either enables the device to detect the missing neutral of the supply, causing the device to trip, or provides an alternative supply path for the tripping circuitry, enabling it to continue to function normally in the absence of the supply neutral.

Related to this, a single-pole RCD/RCBO interrupts the energized conductor only, while a double-pole device interrupts both the energized and return conductors. Usually this is a standard and safe practice, since the return conductor is held at ground potential anyway. However, because of its design, a single-pole RCD will not isolate or disconnect all relevant wires in certain uncommon situations, for example where the return conductor is not being held, as expected, at ground potential, or where current leakage occurs between the return and earth conductors. In these cases, a double-pole RCD will offer protection, since the return conductor would also be disconnected.

==History and nomenclature==
The world&#x27;s first high-sensitivity earth leakage protection system (i.e. a system capable of protecting people from the hazards of direct contact between a conductor and earth), was a second-harmonic magnetic amplifier core-balance system, known as the magamp, developed in South Africa by Henri Rubin. Electrical hazards were of great concern in South African gold mines, and Rubin, an engineer at the company C.J. Fuchs Electrical Industries of Alberton Johannesburg, initially developed a cold-cathode system in 1955 which operated at 525V and had a tripping sensitivity of 250mA. Prior to this, core balance earth leakage protection systems operated at sensitivities of about 10A.

The cold cathode system was installed in a number of gold mines and worked reliably. However, Rubin began working on a completely novel system with greatly improved sensitivity, and by early 1956, he had produced a prototype second-harmonic magnetic amplifier-type core balance system (South African Patent No. 2268/56 and Australian Patent No. 218360). The prototype magamp was rated at 220V, 60A and had an internally adjustable tripping sensitivity of 12.5–17.5mA. Very rapid tripping times were achieved through a novel design, and this combined with the high sensitivity was well within the safe current–time envelope for ventricular fibrillation determined by Charles Dalziel of the University of California, Berkeley, United States, who had estimated electrical shock hazards in humans. This system, with its associated circuit breaker, included overcurrent and short-circuit protection. In addition, the original prototype was able to trip at a lower sensitivity in the presence of an interrupted neutral, thus protecting against an important cause of electrical fire.

Following the accidental electrocution of a woman in a domestic accident at the Stilfontein gold mining village near Johannesburg, a few hundred F.W.J. 20mA magamp earth leakage protection units were installed in the homes of the mining village during 1957 and 1958. F.W.J. Electrical Industries, which later changed its name to FW Electrical Industries, continued to manufacture 20mA single phase and three phase magamp units.

At the time that he worked on the magamp, Rubin also considered using transistors in this application, but concluded that the early transistors then available were too unreliable. However, with the advent of improved transistors, the company that he worked for and other companies later produced transistorized versions of earth leakage protection.

In 1961, Dalziel, working with Rucker Manufacturing Co., developed a transistorized device for earth leakage protection which became known as a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), sometimes colloquially shortened to ground fault interrupter (GFI). This name for high-sensitivity earth leakage protection is still in common use in the United States.

In the early 1970s most North American GFCI devices were of the circuit breaker type. GFCIs built into the outlet receptacle became commonplace beginning in the 1980s. The circuit breaker type, installed into a distribution panel, suffered from accidental trips mainly caused by poor or inconsistent insulation on the wiring. False trips were frequent when insulation problems were compounded by long circuit lengths. So much current leaked along the length of the conductors&#x27; insulation that the breaker might trip with the slightest increase of current imbalance. The migration to outlet-receptacle–based protection in North American installations reduced the accidental trips and provided obvious verification that wet areas were under electrical-code–required protection. European installations continue to use primarily RCDs installed at the distribution board, which provides protection in case of damage to fixed wiring. In Europe socket-based RCDs are primarily used for retrofitting. 

==Regulation and adoption==

Regulations differ widely from country to country. A single RCD installed for an entire electrical installation provides protection against shock hazards to all circuits, however, any fault may cut all power to the premises. A solution is to create groups of circuits, each with an RCD, or to use an RCBO for each individual circuit.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, residual current devices have been mandatory on power circuits since 1991 and on light circuits since 2000. In Queensland specifically, residual power devices have been compulsory for all new homes since 1992.

A minimum of two RCDs is required per domestic installation. All socket outlets and lighting circuits are to be distributed over circuit RCDs. A maximum of three subcircuits only, may be connected to a single RCD. In Australia, the RCD testing procedure must meet a set standard – this is the AS/NZS 3760:2010 in-service safety inspection and testing of electrical equipment.

=== Austria ===
Austria regulated residual current devices in the ÖVE E8001-1/A1:2013-11-01 norm (most recent revision). It has been required in private housing since 1980. The maximum activation time must not exceed 0.4 seconds. It needs to be installed on all circuits with power plugs with a maximum leakage current of 30mA and a maximum rated current of 16A.

Additional requirements are placed on circuits in wet areas, construction sites and commercial buildings.

=== Belgium ===
Belgian domestic installations are required to be equipped with a 300mA residual current device that protects all circuits. Furthermore, at least one 30mA residual current device is required that protects all circuits in &quot;wet rooms&quot; (e.g. bathroom, kitchen) as well as circuits that power certain &quot;wet&quot; appliances (washing machine, tumble dryer, dishwasher). Electrical underfloor heating is required to be protected by a 100mA RCD. These RCDs must be of type A.

=== Brazil ===
Since NBR 5410 (1997) residual current devices and grounding are required for new construction or repair in wet areas, outdoor areas, interior outlets used for external appliances, or in areas where water is more probable like bathrooms and kitchens.

=== Denmark ===
Denmark requires 30mA RCDs on all circuits that are rated for less than 20 A (circuits at greater rating are mostly used for distribution). RCDs became mandatory in 1975 for new buildings, and then for all buildings in 2008.

=== France ===
According to the NF C 15-100 regulation (1911 -&gt; 2002), a general RCD not exceeding 100 to 300mA at the origin of the installation is mandatory. Moreover, all circuits must also include 30mA protections in the user&#x27;s distribution board, with each RCD protecting up to 8 circuit breakers, usually on the same DIN rail (electric panels of 1 to 4 DIN rails are the norm for residential). Before 1991, this 30mA protection was mandatory only in rooms where there is water, high power or sensitive equipment (bathrooms, kitchens, IT...). The type of RCD required (A, AC, F) depends upon the type of the equipment that will be connected and the maximum power of the socket outlet. Minimal distances between electrical devices and water or the floor are described and mandatory.

=== Germany ===
Since 1 May 1984, RCDs are mandatory for all rooms with a bath tub or a shower. Since June 2007 Germany requires the use of RCDs with a trip current of no more than 30mA on sockets rated up to 32A which are for general use. (DIN &quot;Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik&quot; (VDE) 0100-410 Nr. 411.3.3). It is not allowed to use type &quot;AC&quot; RCDs since 1987, to be used to protect humans against electrical shocks. It must be Type &quot;A&quot; or type &quot;B&quot;.

=== India ===
According to Regulation 36 of the Electricity Regulations 1990

a) For a place of public entertainment, protection against earth leakage current must be provided by a residual current device of sensitivity not exceeding 10mA.

b) For a place where the floor is likely to be wet or where the wall or enclosure is of low electrical resistance, protection against earth leakage current must be provided by a residual current device of sensitivity not exceeding 10mA.

c) For an installation where hand-held equipment, apparatus or appliance is likely to be used, protection against earth leakage current must be provided by a residual current device of sensitivity not exceeding 30mA.

d) For an installation other than the installation in (a), (b) and (c), protection against earth leakage current must be provided by a residual current device of sensitivity not exceeding 100mA.

=== Italy ===
The Italian law (n. 46 March 1990) prescribes RCDs with no more than 30mA residual current (informally called &quot;salvavita&quot;—life saver, after early BTicino models, or differential circuit breaker for the mode of operation) for all domestic installations to protect all the lines. The law was recently updated to mandate at least two separate RCDs for separate domestic circuits. Short-circuit and overload protection has been compulsory since 1968.

=== Malaysia ===
In the latest guidelines for electrical wiring in residential buildings (2008) handbook, the overall residential wiring need to be protected by a residual current device of sensitivity not exceeding 100mA. Additionally, all power sockets need to be protected by a residual current device of sensitivity not exceeding 30mA and all equipment in wet places (water heater, water pump) need to be protected by a residual current device of sensitivity not exceeding 10mA.

=== New Zealand ===
From January 2003, all new circuits originating at the switchboard supplying lighting or socket outlets (power points) in domestic buildings must have RCD protection. Residential facilities (such as boarding houses, hospitals, hotels and motels) will also require RCD protection for all new circuits originating at the switchboard supplying socket outlets. These RCDs will normally be located at the switchboard. They will provide protection for all electrical wiring and appliances plugged into the new circuits.

=== North America ===
In North America socket-outlets located in places where an easy path to ground exists—such as wet areas and rooms with uncovered concrete floors—must be protected by a GFCI. The US &quot;National Electrical Code&quot; has required devices in certain locations to be protected by GFCIs since the 1960s. Beginning with underwater swimming pool lights (1968) successive editions of the code have expanded the areas where GFCIs are required to include: construction sites (1974), bathrooms and outdoor areas (1975), garages (1978), areas near hot tubs or spas (1981), hotel bathrooms (1984), kitchen counter sockets (1987), crawl spaces and unfinished basements (1990), near wet bar sinks (1993), near laundry sinks (2005), in laundry rooms (2014) and in kitchens (2023).

GFCIs are commonly available as an integral part of a socket or a circuit breaker installed in the distribution panelboard. GFCI sockets invariably have rectangular faces and accept so-called Decora face plates, and can be mixed with regular outlets or switches in a multi-gang box with standard cover plates. In both Canada and the US older two-wire, ungrounded NEMA 1 sockets may be replaced with NEMA 5 sockets protected by a GFCI (integral with the socket or with the corresponding circuit breaker) in lieu of rewiring the entire circuit with a grounding conductor. In such cases the sockets must be labeled &quot;no equipment ground&quot; and &quot;GFCI protected&quot;; GFCI manufacturers typically provide tags for the appropriate installation description.

GFCIs approved for protection against electric shock trip at 5mA within 25ms. A GFCI device which protects equipment (not people) is allowed to trip as high as 30mA of current; this is known as an Equipment Protective Device (EPD). RCDs with trip currents as high as 500mA are sometimes deployed in environments (such as computing centers) where a lower threshold would carry an unacceptable risk of accidental trips. These high-current RCDs serve for equipment and fire protection instead of protection against the risks of electrical shocks.
In the United States the American Boat and Yacht Council requires both GFCIs for outlets and Equipment Leakage Circuit Interrupters (ELCI) for the entire boat. The difference is GFCIs trip on 5mA of current whereas ELCIs trip on 30mA after up to 100ms. The greater values are intended to provide protection while minimizing nuisance trips.

=== Norway ===
In Norway, it has been required in all new homes since 2002, and on all new sockets since 2006. This applies to 32A sockets and below. The RCD must trigger after a maximum 0.4 seconds for 230V circuits, or 0.2 seconds for 400V circuits.

=== South Africa ===
South Africa mandated the use of Earth Leakage Protection devices in residential environments (e.g. houses, flats, hotels, etc.) from October 1974, with regulations being refined in 1975 and 1976.
Devices need to be installed in new premises and when repairs are carried out. Protection is required for power outlets and lighting, with the exception of emergency lighting that should not be interrupted. The standard device used in South Africa is indeed a hybrid of ELPD and RCCB.

=== Switzerland ===
According to the NIBT regulation, the use of RCD type AC is forbidden (since 2010).

=== Taiwan ===
Taiwan requires circuits of receptacles in washrooms, balconies, and receptacles in kitchen no more than 1.8 metres from the sink the use of earth leakage circuit breakers. This requirement also apply to circuit of water heater in washrooms and circuits that involves devices in water, lights on metal frames, public drinking fountains and so on. In principle, ELCBs should be installed on branch circuits, with trip current no more than 30mA within 0.1 second according to Taiwanese law.

=== Turkey ===
Turkey requires the use of RCDs with no more than 30mA and 300mA in all new homes since 2004. This rule was introduced in RG-16/06/2004-25494.

=== United Kingdom ===

The current (18th) edition of the IET Electrical Wiring Regulations requires that all socket outlets in most installations have RCD protection, though there are exemptions. Non armoured cables buried in walls must also be RCD protected (again with some specific exemptions). Provision of RCD protection for circuits present in bathrooms and shower rooms reduces the requirement for supplementary bonding in those locations. Two RCDs may be used to cover the installation, with upstairs and downstairs lighting and power circuits spread across both RCDs. When one RCD trips, power is maintained to at least one lighting and power circuit. Other arrangements, such as the use of RCBOs, may be employed to meet the regulations. The new requirements for RCDs do not affect most existing installations unless they are rewired, the distribution board is changed, a new circuit is installed, or alterations are made such as additional socket outlets or new cables buried in walls.

RCDs used for shock protection must be of the &#x27;immediate&#x27; operation type (not time-delayed) and must have a residual current sensitivity of no greater than 30mA.

If spurious tripping would cause a greater problem than the risk of the electrical accident the RCD is supposed to prevent (examples might be a supply to a critical factory process, or to life support equipment), RCDs may be omitted, providing affected circuits are clearly labelled and the balance of risks considered; this may include the provision of alternative safety measures.

The previous edition of the regulations required use of RCDs for socket outlets that were liable to be used by outdoor appliances. Normal practice in domestic installations was to use a single RCD to cover all the circuits requiring RCD protection (typically sockets and showers) but to have some circuits (typically lighting) not RCD protected. This was to avoid a potentially dangerous loss of lighting should the RCD trip. Protection arrangements for other circuits varied. To implement this arrangement it was common to install a consumer unit incorporating an RCD in what is known as a split load configuration, where one group of circuit breakers is supplied direct from the main switch (or time delay RCD in the case of a TT earth) and a second group of circuits is supplied via the RCD. This arrangement had the recognised problems that cumulative earth leakage currents from the normal operation of many items of equipment could cause spurious tripping of the RCD, and that tripping of the RCD would disconnect power from all the protected circuits.

<text>Lucius Lyon (February 26, 1800September 24, 1851) was a U.S. statesman from the state of Michigan. Along with Louis Campau, Lucius Lyon is remembered as one of the founding fathers of Grand Rapids, Michigan, the state&#x27;s second-largest city. A Democrat, he served as a Delegate to the U.S. House from Michigan Territory (1833–1835), a U.S. Senator from Michigan (1837–1839), and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Michigan&#x27;s second congressional district (1843–1845).

==Early life==
Lyon was born in Shelburne, Vermont, on February 26, 1800, a son of Asa Lyon and Sarah (Atwater) Lyon. He received a common school education in Shelburne and then worked with his father on the family farm. At age 18, Lyon began attendance at academies in Shelburne and Burlington, and he taught school in between academy terms. He studied engineering and surveying with John Johnson of Burlington, and moved to Detroit, Michigan Territory, in 1821. Lyon initially worked in Michigan as a teacher, then took up surveying, and was eventually appointed Deputy Surveyor General of Michigan Territory.

==Early career==
During the summers of the mid-1820s, Lyon surveyed areas that are now parts of Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa. In the winters, he often visited family in Vermont and studied scientific subjects including geology at Middlebury College. These studies enabled him to develop superior knowledge of Michigan Territory, including land and lakes, flora and fauna, and natural resources. In 1829, he was commissioned to rebuild the Fort Gratiot Lighthouse at the entrance to the St. Clair River from Lake Huron. In the 1830s, he surveyed a portion of what would become the boundary between Illinois and Wisconsin. Lyon placed the initial point of the Fourth Principal Meridian on December 10, 1831. He also participated in the survey parties which established the baseline and meridian used to define townships in Wisconsin. His field notebooks recorded considerable detail about the land he surveyed, providing a rich source of information for later researchers.

When Michigan applied for statehood in the 1830s, action was delayed in Congress because Ohio objected to surrendering the Toledo Strip, which resulted in a conflict known as the Toledo War. Lyon&#x27;s detailed knowledge of Michigan&#x27;s geography enabled him to make a persuasive argument to residents of Michigan that accepting the Upper Peninsula in lieu of the Toledo Strip was an equitable solution. The compromise caused Ohio to withdraw its objections to Michigan statehood, and Michigan joined the Union in 1837.

==Continued career==
Lyon was elected as a non-voting Delegate to the U.S. Congress for the Michigan Territory, serving from 1833 to 1835. On December 11, 1833, he presented a formal petition to Congress requesting Michigan&#x27;s admission into the Union. Congress delayed consideration of statehood, in part due to a dispute with Ohio over the Toledo Strip and also in part due to opposition from southern states to admit another free state.

From May 11 to June 24, 1835, he was a member of the convention that drafted the first Michigan Constitution, which voters adopted in October, 1835. In November 1835, Lyon was elected as U.S. Senator. However Michigan&#x27;s delegation to Congress was seated as &quot;spectators&quot;, pending Michigan&#x27;s admission as a state. Upon Michigan&#x27;s admission as a state on January 26, 1837, Lyon served as a full U.S. Senator until 1839.

On March 28, 1836, Lyon was a witness to the Treaty of Washington of 1836, in which the Ottawa and Chippewa nations of Indians ceded much of the land in the northern portion of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. He was also witness to a separate treaty on May 9, 1836, with the Chippewa in which additional land was ceded.

He did not run for reelection in 1839 and moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan. He was a member of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan from 1837 to 1839, and was appointed Indian commissioner at La Pointe, Wisconsin, in 1839. He was elected as a Democrat from the newly formed 2nd district in Michigan to the 28th Congress, serving one term from March 4, 1843, to March 3, 1845. He was the first person to represent Michigan in both the U.S. Senate and U.S. House. In both houses of Congress he served on the Committee on Public Lands. He did not run for reelection to the U.S. House in 1844.

==Later career==
After leaving Congress, Lyon was appointed by President James K. Polk as U.S. Surveyor General for Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. He moved the office for this post from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Detroit, Michigan, and served from 1845 to 1850.

Lyon was also a major financial backer of Hiram Moore, an inventor and a founder of the village of Climax, Michigan. Moore reportedly invented a working farm machine in the 1830s and 1840s that &quot;combined&quot; the functions of a threshing machine and a reaper, decades before combines were commonly available. Moore&#x27;s designs were allegedly copied by Cyrus McCormick and despite many years of legal wrangling, Moore was unsuccessful in pursuing his patent claims.

He also owned a large tract of land in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and engaged in a feud over platting the area with the other major land owner, Louis Campau. Lyon wanted to call it the village of Kent rather than Grand Rapids. Lyon is also remembered in Grand Rapids for attempting to commercialize salt deposits in the city by boring a hole and extracting salt from the brine water below.

Lyon professed the Swedenborgian religious faith and was an active advocate for temperance until he later became affiliated with the Washingtonian movement, which advocated the total abstinence from consuming alcohol.

==Death and burial==
Lyon never married, and had no children. He died at the Detroit home of his nephew George W. Thayer on September 24, 1851. Lyon was buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit.

==Legacy==
The Michigan locales South Lyon; Lyon Township, Oakland County; Lyon Township, Roscommon County; Lyon Lake; and Lyons Township are all named after Lyon. Notably, in 1836, Lucius Lyon purchased much of the property in a small village in Ionia County, Michigan, and renamed it Lyons. He platted the village, established the first post office and installed his brother, Truman, as the first postmaster, although he never lived in the village.

Lyon Street and Lyon Square, both located in downtown Grand Rapids, Michigan, are named after him. In 2008, city leaders erected a bronze statue of Lyon&#x27;s likeness downtown, as part of a &quot;Community Legends&quot; initiative intended to pay tribute to pivotal figures in Grand Rapids history.

<doc id="530719" wikidata="Q347871" url="?curid=530719" title="Sigismond Thalberg">
<text>Sigismond Thalberg (8 January 1812 – 27 April 1871) was an Austrian composer and one of the most distinguished virtuoso pianists of the 19th century.

==Family==
Thalberg was born in Pâquis near Geneva on 8 January 1812. Thalberg asserted that he was the illegitimate son of Moritz, Prince of Dietrichstein and Maria Julia Bydeskuty von Ipp, from a Hungarian family of lower nobility. In 1820, Julia married Baron Alexander Ludwig (from an ennobled Jewish Viennese family). According to Thalberg&#x27;s birth certificate, he was the son of Joseph Thalberg and Fortunée Stein, both from Frankfurt-am-Main.

==Early life==
Little is known about Thalberg&#x27;s childhood and early youth. It is possible that his mother had brought him to Vienna at the age of 10 (the same year in which the 10-year-old Franz Liszt arrived there with his parents). According to Thalberg&#x27;s own account, he attended the first performance of Beethoven&#x27;s 9th Symphony on 7 May 1824, in the Kärntnerthortheater.

There is no evidence as to Thalberg&#x27;s early teachers. Baroness von Wetzlar, his putative mother, who according to Wurzbach was occupied with his education during his childhood and early youth, was a brilliant amateur pianist. It may be therefore that she gave him his first instruction at the piano.
In spring 1826, Thalberg studied with Ignaz Moscheles in London. Moscheles, according to a letter to Felix Mendelssohn dated 14 August 1836, had the impression that Thalberg had already reached a level at which no further help would be needed in order to become a great artist. Thalberg&#x27;s first public performance in London was on 17 May 1826. In Vienna, 6 April 1827, he played the first movement of Hummel&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3 in B minor, later playing the &quot;Adagio&quot; and the &quot;Rondo&quot; on 6 May 1827. After this, Thalberg performed regularly in Vienna. His repertoire was mainly classical, including concertos by Hummel, Mozart and Beethoven. He also performed chamber music. In the year 1827, his Op. 1, a fantasy and variations on melodies from Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s &quot;Euryanthe&quot;, was published by Tobias Haslinger.

In 1830, Thalberg met Mendelssohn and Frédéric Chopin in Vienna. Their letters show their opinion that Thalberg&#x27;s main strength was his astonishing technical skills. Further information can be found in the diary of the 10-year-old Clara Wieck. She had heard Thalberg on 14 May 1830 at a concert which he gave in the theatre of Leipzig. He had played his own &quot;Piano Concerto&quot; in F minor, Op. 5 and a fantasy that he had also composed. Two days before, Clara had played the first solo of John Field&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 to Thalberg, and, together with him, the first movement of Hummel&#x27;s &quot;Sonata for Piano 4-Hands&quot;, Op. 51. Her diary, edited by her father Friedrich Wieck, notes Thalberg as &quot;very accomplished&quot;. His playing was clear and precise, also being very strong and expressive.

In the early 1830s, Thalberg studied counterpoint under Simon Sechter. As a result, passages of canon and fugue can be found in some of Thalberg&#x27;s fantasies of this time. An example is his &quot;Grande fantaisie et variations sur &#x27;Norma&quot;&#x27;, Op. 12, which contains a march-theme and variations (one of them a canon), and a fugue on a lyrical theme. The fantasy was published in 1834 and became very popular; but on publication, it was criticised by some—for example, by Robert Schumann.

Thalberg successfully changed his composing style, reducing the counterpoint. Several works in his new style, among them the &quot;2 Airs russes variés&quot;, Op. 17, were even enthusiastically praised by Schumann.

==Early virtuoso career==
In November 1835, Thalberg arrived in Paris. He performed on 16 November 1835 at a private concert of the Austrian ambassador Count Rudolph Apponyi. On 24 January 1836, he took part in a concert of the &quot;Society of the Paris Conservatoire concerts&quot;, playing his &quot;Grande fantaisie&quot;, Op. 22. Thalberg was praised by many of the most prominent artists, among them Rossini and Meyerbeer.

Chopin didn&#x27;t share his fellow artists&#x27; enthusiasm. After hearing Thalberg play, in Vienna, Chopin wrote:He plays splendidly, but he&#x27;s not my man. He&#x27;s younger than I and pleases the ladies—makes &quot;potpourris&quot; on &quot;La Muette&quot;—produces his &quot;piano&quot; and &quot;forte&quot; with the pedal, not the hand—takes tenths as I do octaves and wears diamond shirt studs.

His début at the Conservatoire concert was in the &quot;Revue et gazette musicale&quot; of 31 January 1836, enthusiastically reviewed by Hector Berlioz. &quot;Le&quot; &quot;Ménestrel&quot; of 13 March 1836 wrote:Moscheles, Kalkbrenner, Chopin, Liszt and Herz are and will always be for me great artists, but Thalberg is the creator of a new art which I do not know how to compare to anything that existed before him . . . Thalberg is not only the premier pianist of the world, he is also an extremely distinguished composer.On 16 April 1836, Thalberg gave his first solo concert in Paris, and the success was again sensational. According to Apponyi&#x27;s diary, Thalberg made a profit of 10,000 francs (say 5000 bottles of fine Burgundy wine of €12 or US$13 a bottle in 2024 money), a sum that no virtuoso had gained before from a single concert.

Liszt had heard of Thalberg&#x27;s successes during the winter 1835–36 in Geneva, in spring 1836 in Lyon, and in Paris. In his letter to Marie d&#x27;Agoult of 29 April 1836, he compared himself to the exiled Napoleon. In a review of 8 January 1837, in the &quot;Revue et Gazette musicale&quot;, Liszt controversially denigrated Thalberg&#x27;s compositions.

After Thalberg returned to Paris in the beginning of February 1837, a rivalry developed between him and Liszt. On 4 February, Thalberg heard Liszt play in concert for the first time in his life. Thalberg was stupefied. While Liszt then gave over a dozen concerts, Thalberg gave only one concert on 12 March 1837 in the Paris Conservatoire, and a further concert on 2 April 1837. In addition, on 31 March 1837, both Liszt and Thalberg played at a benefit concert to raise money for Italian refugees.

In May 1837, Thalberg gave a concert in London, following which &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; gave an enthusiastic review. Such enthusiasm followed Thalberg throughout the following years. His &quot;Fantasia on Rossini&#x27;s &#x27;Moses&quot;&#x27;, Op. 33 became one of the most famous concert pieces of the 19th century, and was still praised by Berlioz in his &quot;Mémoires&quot; (1870). The fantasy was published at end of March 1839; in May 1839, Clara Schumann studied and was delighted by it. In 1848, the fantasy was played by Liszt&#x27;s daughter Blandine.

==European tours==
===First steps===
After Thalberg&#x27;s stay in London in May 1837, he made a first, short tour, giving concerts in several towns in Great Britain, but he became ill and soon returned to Vienna. In spring 1838, he gave concerts in Paris again. A note in the &quot;Revue et Gazette musicale&quot; of 4 March 1838 shows that Thalberg&#x27;s fame had in the meantime grown. He was now called &quot;the most famous of our composers&quot;. Thalberg left Paris on 18 April 1838, travelling to Vienna, the very same day that Liszt gave there a charity concert for the benefit of the victims of a flood in Hungary. Thalberg invited Liszt for dinner, and the two great pianists dined together on the 28th with Prince Moritz Dietrichstein, who told Liszt that he was delighted to have &quot;Castor and Pollux&quot; together in his home. During the evening, Thalberg remarked to Liszt with admirable candour: &quot;In comparison with you, I have never enjoyed more than a &quot;succes d&#x27;estime&quot; in Vienna&quot;. They dined again the next day, after Liszt&#x27;s concert on 29 April 1838. Liszt and Thalberg were both dinner guests of Metternich. During Liszt&#x27;s stay in Vienna, Thalberg did not perform at all.

In October 1838, Thalberg became acquainted with Schumann. According to Schumann&#x27;s diary, Thalberg played from memory études by Chopin, Joseph Christoph Kessler, and Ferdinand Hiller. He also played with great skill and inspiration works by Beethoven, Schubert, and Dussek, as well sight-reading Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Kreisleriana&quot;, Op. 16. On 27 November 1838, Thalberg took part in a charity concert, playing his new &quot;Fantasia on Rossini&#x27;s &#x27;La Donna del Lago&quot;&#x27;, Op. 40 (&quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; after Walter Scott). At one of his own &quot;Farewell concerts&quot; on 1 December 1838, he played three of his &quot;12 Etudes&quot;, Op. 26; his Op. 33 (&quot;Moses&quot;); and his &quot;Fantasia on Beethoven&#x27;s 7th Symphony&quot;, Op. 39. As a result, in the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot; of 8 March 1839, an enthusiastic review by Schumann of the second book (likely Nos. 6–12) of Thalberg&#x27;s Op. 26 appeared, concluding &quot;He is a God when sitting at the piano.&quot;

===First extended tour===
After Thalberg&#x27;s &quot;Farewell concert&quot; in Vienna, he began his first extended European tour. On 19 and 21 December 1838, he gave two concerts in Dresden, and he performed twice at the Court. Receiving honours from the King of Saxony, he told him, &quot;Wait until you have heard Liszt!&quot; In Leipzig, he gave a concert on 28 December 1838, attended by Mendelssohn, who, on the following day—in a letter to his sister Fanny—gave an enthusiastic account. Mendelssohn became a friend and admirer of Thalberg.

After a second concert in Leipzig on 30 December 1838, Thalberg travelled to Berlin to give a series of concerts there. Via Danzig, Mitau, and other places, he performed at St. Petersburg, receiving excellent reviews. From St. Petersburg, he went on a steamboat to London where he gave further concerts. He then journeyed to Brussels to meet his violinist friend Charles de Bériot. There, he gave several private performances.

After Brussels, Thalberg arrived in the Rhineland, where he gave a series of concerts with Bériot. He returned to London at the beginning of February 1840, and then travelled from London to Paris together with Baroness Wetzlar, his mother, awaiting the arrival of Liszt.

===Interlude===
Thalberg had already announced in December 1838—during his stay in Leipzig—that he would take time off at the end of his tour, and did not perform at any concert during his stay in spring 1840 in Paris.

At this time Mendelssohn, after meeting Liszt, compared him to Thalberg in a letter to his mother:Thalberg, with his composure, and within his more restricted sphere, is more nearly perfect as a real virtuoso; and after all this is the standard by which Liszt must also be judged, for his compositions are inferior to his playing, and, in fact, are calculated solely for virtuosi.After the end of the Parisian concert season, Thalberg travelled as tourist in the Rhineland. In the beginning of June 1840, he attended a music festival directed by Louis Spohr in Aachen. He got an invitation from the Russian Tsarina and performed at a court-concert in Bad Ems, but this was his only concert during his stay in the Rhineland. According to a note in the &quot;Revue et Gazette musicale&quot; of 2 August 1840, Bériot would get married two days later in Elsene (Ixelles). His bride was a young lady Maria Huber, born in Vienna, from Germany. She was an orphan and had been adopted by Prince von Dietrichstein, Thalberg&#x27;s father. It may therefore be presumed that Thalberg wanted to take part in the wedding celebration. During previous visits to the Rhineland, he wanted only to relax. He also taught Bériot&#x27;s son, the pianist Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot.

In the &quot;Revue et Gazette musicale&quot; of 9 May 1841, an essay by Fétis appeared—&quot;Études d&#x27;exécution transcendente&quot;—in which he praised Liszt for a new composing style which had been stimulated by Thalberg&#x27;s challenge. In letters to Fétis of 17 May 1841, and to Simon Löwy of 20 May 1841, Liszt agreed with this analysis.

===1840–1848===
Thalberg performed in Brussels in fall 1840. He then travelled to Frankfurt-am-Main, where he stayed until January 1841. It had been announced that Thalberg would give concerts in Paris again in spring 1841, but he changed his plans. In Frankfurt, he only took part in a charity concert on 15 January 1841, playing his fantasies on &quot;La Donna del Lago&quot; and &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;. He was busily composing new works; his &quot;Grande fantaisie sur la Sérénade et le Menuet de &#x27;Don Juan&#x27;&quot;, Op. 42 and his &quot;Fantasia on Rossini&#x27;s &#x27;Semiramide&quot;&#x27;, Op. 51 date from this time.

In the second half of January 1841, Thalberg travelled from Frankfurt to Weimar, where he performed three times at the Grand Duke&#x27;s court and also in the Theatre. He then went to Leipzig, where he visited Mendelssohn and Schumann. On 8 February 1841, he gave a solo concert in Leipzig, enthusiastically reviewed by Schumann, playing his Op. 42 (&quot;Don Juan&quot;); his &quot;Andante final de &#x27;Lucia di Lammermoor&#x27;&quot;, Op. 44; his &quot;Theme and Etude&quot;, Op. 45; and his &quot;Grand Caprice on Bellini&#x27;s &#x27;La Sonnambula&quot;&#x27;, Op. 46.

Clara Schumann (&quot;née&quot; Wieck) noted in her diary:On Monday Thalberg visited us and played to the delightment beautiful on my piano. An even more accomplished mechanism than his does not exist, and many of his piano effects must ravish the connoisseurs. He does not fail a single note, his passages can be compared to rows of pearls, his octaves are the most beautiful ones I ever heard.Mendelssohn&#x27;s student Horsley wrote of the meeting of his teacher and Thalberg:We were a trio, and after dinner Mendelssohn asked Thalberg if he had written anything new, whereupon Thalberg sat down to the piano and played his Fantasia from the &quot;Sonnambula&quot; . . . At the close there are several runs of Chromatique Octaves, which at that time had not previously heard, and of which peculiar passages Thalberg was undoubtedly the inventor. Mendelssohn was much struck with the novel effect produced, and greatly admired its ingenuity . . . he told me to be with him the next afternoon at 2 o&#x27;clock. When I arrived at his study door I heard him playing to himself, and practising continually this passage which had so struck him the previous day. I waited for at least half an hour listening in wonderment to the facility with which he applied his own thoughts to the cleverness of Thalberg&#x27;s mechanism, and then went into the room. He laughed and said: &#x27;Listen to this, is it not almost like Thalberg?&#x27;After his stay in Leipzig, Thalberg gave concerts in Breslau and Warsaw. He then travelled to Vienna and gave two successful concerts there. In a review in the &quot;Leipziger Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot;, Thalberg was described as Liszt&#x27;s only rival.

In winter 1841–1842, Thalberg gave concerts in Italy, while Liszt, from end of December 1841 until beginning of March 1842, gave a series of concerts in Berlin. Thalberg matched Liszt&#x27;s successes in Berlin. He then returned via Marseilles, Toulon, and Dijon, arriving on 11 April 1842, in Paris. On the next day, he gave his first—and on 21 April, his second—concert. According to an account by Berlioz, Thalberg made a profit of 12,000 francs from his first concert, and one of 13,000 francs from his second. The concerts were reviewed in the &quot;Revue et Gazette musicale&quot; by Henri Blanchard who—two years before, in his review of Liszt&#x27;s concert on 20 April 1840—had nominated Thalberg as Cesar, Octavian or Napoleon of the piano. In spring 1842, Blanchard reached for new superlatives even surpassing his former ones. In his review of Thalberg&#x27;s second concert, he wrote that Thalberg would in 100 years have been canonized—and by all coming pianists, be invoked with—the name of Holy Thalberg. According to the account by Berlioz, at the end of Thalberg&#x27;s second concert, a golden crown was thrown onto the stage.

In addition to his own concerts, Thalberg took part in a concert of Émile Prudent. He then travelled via Brussels to London. Later, in 1842, Thalberg was decorated with the Cross of the French Legion of Honour. He travelled to Vienna where he stayed until fall 1842. In the second half of November until 12 December 1842, he made a further tour in Great Britain, and in January 1843, he returned to Paris. At the end of March 1843, he performed at a private concert of Pierre Erard (nephew of the piano and harp maker Sébastien Érard), but this was his only concert appearance during that season.=

In March 1843, Heinrich Heine wrote about Thalberg:His performance is so gentlemanly, so entirely without any forced acting the genius, so entirely without that well-known brashness that makes a poor cover for inner insecurity. Healthy women love him. So do sickly women, even though he does not engage their sympathy by epileptic seizures at the piano, even though he does not play at their overstrung, delicate nerves, even though he neither electrifies them nor galvanizes them.In winter 1843–44, Thalberg gave concerts in Italy again. At the end of March 1844, he returned to Paris, where—at the same time—Liszt was also expected. Liszt arrived on April 8 and gave on 16 April a first concert, at which he played his &quot;Réminiscences de Norma&quot;, S. 394, published shortly before. When composing this fantasy, Liszt had put many Thalbergian effects into it. In his later years, he told August Göllerich, one of his pupils:As I met Thalberg, I said to him: &#x27;Here I have cribbed everything from you.&#x27; &#x27;Yes,&#x27; he replied, &#x27;there are Thalberg-passages included which are indeed indecent.&#x27;Shortly after Liszt&#x27;s concert on 11 May 1844, Thalberg left Paris. He travelled to London and gave a concert there on 28 May 1844. At a further concert in London, he played a concerto for three pianos by J. S. Bach together with Moscheles and Mendelssohn. He also took part in a concert of Julius Benedict. In August 1844, Thalberg returned to Paris, where he stayed until 1845. During the winter 1844–45, he gave a piano course for selected students at the Paris Conservatoire. On April 2, 1845, he gave a concert in Paris, playing his &quot;Fantasia&quot; on Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Barber of Seville&quot;, Op. 63; his &quot;Grande fantaisie sur les motifs de &#x27;Don Pasquale&quot;&#x27;, Op. 67; and his &quot;Fantasia on Auber&#x27;s &#x27;La Muette de Portici&#x27;&quot;, Op. 52—as well as his &quot;Marche funèbre&quot;, Op. 59 and his &quot;Barcarolle&quot;, Op. 60.

In spring 1848, in Vienna, Liszt met Thalberg once more. On 3 May 1848, Thalberg gave a benefit concert which Liszt attended. According to an account by his pupil , Liszt was sitting on the stage, carefully listening, and loudly applauding. It had been 11 years since he had first heard his rival&#x27;s playing.

== Concerts in America ==

On 22 July 1843, Thalberg married Francesca (&quot;Cecchina&quot;), the eldest daughter of Luigi Lablache, first bass at the &quot;Théâtre des Italiens&quot; in Paris. Thalberg went with his wife to Italy where they stayed for the winter 1843–44.

In 1855, after Thalberg&#x27;s operas &quot;Florinda&quot;, Op. 71 and &quot;Cristina di Svezia&quot; had failed, he realized his ambition to give concerts in America. From July to December 1855, he performed with overwhelming success in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires. He returned to Europe, but—after a stay of several months in Paris—went on the steamboat &quot;Africa&quot; to North America, where he arrived on 3 October 1856, in New York. After Thalberg&#x27;s debut there on 10 November 1856, a performance marathon ensued, during which he spent eight months giving concerts five or six days a week. Occasionally, he gave two or even three concerts a day. On Sundays, concerts were generally only allowed if they presented &quot;sacred music&quot;, but several times Thalberg performed anyhow, playing pieces like his Op. 33 (&quot;Moses&quot;), based on a prayer from Rossini&#x27;s opera, or his Huguenots-fantasy with the chorale &quot;Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott&quot; as main subject. His &quot;Andante&quot;, Op. 32 and his Op. 59 (&quot;Marche funèbre&quot;) were also allowed.

Thalberg&#x27;s first American season ended with a concert on 29 July 1857 in Saratoga Springs. On 15 September 1857, he gave another concert in New York, starting his second season. With very few intermissions, he was busy until his last concert on 12 June 1858, in Peoria. By then, he had visited nearly 80 cities and given more than 320 regular concerts in the United States, and 20 concerts in Canada. In addition, he gave at least 20 free concerts for many thousands of schoolchildren. Thalberg also gave a series of solo matinées in New York and in Boston at which he played own works as well as chamber music. From 1857, the violinist Henri Vieuxtemps toured with Thalberg. They played works by Beethoven and duos composed by Thalberg.
Thalberg&#x27;s financial success on these tours was immense. He got an average of about $500 per concert and probably made more than $150,000 during his two seasons—the equivalent today of about $3 million. A large part of his appeal on these tours was his unpretentious and unassuming personality; he did not resort to advertising gimmicks or cheap crowd-pleasing tricks—instead, he offered superbly polished renditions of his own compositions, which had already been well known in America. Upon rising from the piano after such performances, he was always the same quiet, respectable, self-possessed, middle-aged gentleman that he was at the dinner table of his hotel. He played works by Beethoven, among them the sonatas Nos. 12 (&quot;Funeral March&quot;) and 14 (&quot;Moonlight&quot;), as well as the first movements of the Third and Fifth Piano Concertos. His cadenza to Beethoven&#x27;s third concerto was admired. He also played works by J. S. Bach, Chopin, Hummel, Mendelssohn, and several other composers. The &quot;New-York Musical Review and Gazette&quot; of July 24, 1858, wrote:Thalberg . . . quite unexpectedly closed what has been a most brilliant career—completely successful, musically, giving to the talented and genial artist abundance of both fame and money. There is probably not another virtuoso, whether with instrument or voice (Liszt alone excepted), who could have excited a moiety of the enthusiasm, or gathered a fragment of the dollars, which Thalberg has excited and gathered.The unexpected close referred to the announcement in June 1858 in Chicago that Thalberg would make only one of three scheduled appearances before immediately returning to Europe. In fact, Thalberg did not even perform at &quot;that&quot; concert, but very hastily left instead. His wife, Francesca, had arrived from Europe following reports that Thalberg had an extra-marital liaison. This caused further confusion when the opera singer Zare Thalberg debuted at Covent Garden in 1875. She had been one of his students, but she was misidentified as his daughter.

== Later years ==
The reason as to why Francesca had left for America and returned, with her husband, to Europe is unknown. The death of Thalberg&#x27;s father-in-law, Lablache, on 23 January 1858, could be one reason. A further possibility is that there may have been consideration of legitimizing Thalberg to enable him to succeed his natural father, Prince Franz Joseph von Dietrichstein.

There are unsubstantiated reports that, after his return to Europe, Thalberg settled in Posillipo, near Naples, in a villa that had belonged to Lablache. The reality is that he dwelled at Viale Calascione, 5 in the Pizzofalcone section of Naples, not far from the elite Nunziatella Military School. Thalberg&#x27;s residence at Viale Calascione, 5 is confirmed both by a plaque on the building and by a monument to him in the courtyard. 

For the following four years, Thalberg lived there in silence. In spring 1862, he gave concerts in Paris and London once again, and was as successful as ever. After a last tour in Brazil in 1863, he put an end to his career. He considered taking up a position as a piano professor at the conservatory in Naples, but he did not have the prerequisite of having an Italian nationality. One year later, he received an offer from the same conservatory, but he refused. The claim of Italian pianist and music teacher that Thalberg published instructive editions of J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; and Muzio Clementi&#x27;s &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot; has been recently disputed by Italian pianist and musicologist . When Thalberg died on 27 April 1871, he left behind a collection of several hundred autographs by famous composers, among them J. S. Bach, Handel, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, and others; even Liszt. The collection was sold after Thalberg&#x27;s death. He is buried at Naples&#x27; Poggioreale cemetery.

== Composer ==

In the 1830s and the 1840s, Thalberg&#x27;s style was a major force in European piano playing. He was greatly in fashion and was imitated by others. In 1852, Wilhelm von Lenz wrote:The piano playing of the present day, to tell the truth, consists only of Thalberg simple, Thalberg amended, and Thalberg exaggerated; scratch what is written for the piano, and you will find Thalberg.Ten years later, on 13 June 1862, a London correspondent of the &quot;Revue et gazette musicale&quot; wrote:Thalberg was indeed imitated like no other; his manner was parodied, exaggerated, turned upside down, tortured, and it may have happened to all of us to curse more than once this Thalbergian school which brought us this avalanche of notes, these arpeggios up and down, with, or more often than not without the slightest song in the middle. The apostles have altered the word of the master. But when we return to the source, we are reconciled with him and we prostrate ourselves again, as twenty years ago, as in the time of youth and enthusiasm.
In the late 19th century, Thalberg&#x27;s fame had come to depend on his association with a single piano technique: the &quot;three-hand effect&quot;. Carl Friedrich Weitzmann, in his &quot;Geschichte des Klavierspiels&quot; (1879), wrote:His bravura pieces, fantasies on melodies from Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Mosè&quot; and &quot;La donna del lago&quot;, on motifs from Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot; and on Russian folk-songs, became extraordinarily popular through his own, brilliant execution; however, they treat their subjects always in one and the same way, [namely] . . . to let the tones of a melody be played in the medium octave of the keyboard now by the thumb of the right, now of the left hand, while the rest of the fingers are executing arpeggios filling the whole range of the keyboard.

<text>George L. Spaulding (December 26, 1864 – June 1, 1921) was an American composer, songwriter, and a successful publisher of music. He also composed operettas for children, and easy piano pieces and technical books for elementary level students.

==Family and early life==
Spaulding was born in Newburgh, New York. His full name was George Lawson Spaulding. Spaulding&#x27;s mother was Mary Spaulding, née Lee. William Douglas Spaulding, his father, was a pattern maker by trade and also a well known singer in the local area who appeared in amateur comic opera productions. George was a paternal grandson of John D. Spaulding, the founder of the &quot;Newburgh Gazette&quot;, and the &quot;Newburgh Journal&quot;. At around the age of eleven, he used to create rhymes to songs known by his father. Spaulding studied piano with local teachers, and became proficient enough to accompany his father&#x27;s singing. When he became old enough to leave school, Spaulding worked in the local music store at Newburgh.

==Career==
At the age of sixteen he moved to Brooklyn, where he worked in the music store of the Oliver Ditson Company, and studied harmony for a short time with an organist. 

He began to develop a talent for writing lyrics and composing. Spaulding composed the song &quot;Home would be lonely without thee mother&quot;, in 1883, with Mary Lee as the lyricist. Also in 1883, one of Spaulding&#x27;s composed songs appeared in a book, with lyrics by his father. This song was called &quot;Sail Ho! (A Sea Song)&quot;. Between 1884 and 1885, several other songs were published with George Spaulding as the composer and his father as the lyricist. A piano piece by Spaulding was published in 1884, titled &quot;Jim Blaine&#x27;s Galop&quot;. On the front cover of the sheet music was written &quot;Jim Blaine of Maine. His Galop To The White House&quot;. It referred to James G. Blaine, who ended up being narrowly defeated in the 1884 United States presidential election. His piano pieces &quot;Rapido Polka&quot;, and &quot;Ocean Beauties: Waltzes&quot;, were published in 1884 and 1885 respectively. George Spaulding was the composer and lyricist of &quot;Her Parting Words To Me&quot;, in 1885. Also in 1885, he composed the song &quot;He&#x27;s English And So Sweet&quot;, with words by J. W. Turner, and was the composer of a separate piano arrangement of it.

He left the Oliver Ditson Company, and opened a music shop in Brooklyn with George A. Kornder under the firm name of Spaulding &amp; Kornder. The store was located at 487 Fulton Street. By 1888, Spaulding &amp; Kornder had also become music publishers operating from that address. They had success with the publishing of the song &quot;Down Went McGinty&quot;, in 1889.

In 1891, under the pseudonym of Henry Lamb, he was the lyricist and composer of &quot;My Mary Green&quot;. George sold all the rights of this song to a music publisher named Frank Harding for only $15. It was very popular all over the United States, and also in England. 

In 1893 George Spaulding formed a music publishing partnership with William B. Gray. The address of the business was at 16 West 27th Street, New York. Their first success came with the song &quot;Two Little Girls In Blue&quot;. Gray purchased the rights of the song from its composer Charles Graham, for just ten dollars, changed the music and words of the original song, but still credited Graham with being the author. Spaulding and Gray published it in 1893 and the song made $35,000. In the same year, Gray bought the rights to the song &quot;The Fatal Wedding&quot; from Gussie Davis, for just $25 and rewrote it. Spaulding and Gray published it, crediting Davis as the composer and the money generated from the sales of that song, was also extremely high. Among songs that they each composed together and were popular included &quot;The Volunteer Organist&quot;, &quot;Carrie (That&#x27;s My Darling Carrie)&quot;, &quot;Take Back the Engagement Ring&quot;, and &quot;When You Know The Girl You Love, Loves You&quot;.

At Gilsey House on 11 June 1895, at the inaugural meeting of the Music Publishers&#x27; Association of the United States, he was elected as their vice-president. He was elected again to that position on 9 June 1896.

By 1897, Spaulding had set up a business as a music publisher under his own name at 29 East 20th Street, New York. Songs that were written, composed, and published by himself from that address between 1897 and 1900, included &quot;Somebody Has My Heart&quot;, &quot;In An Old New England Village By The Sea&quot;, and &quot;Pretty Jessie Moore&quot;.

George Spaulding also had a great talent for writing simple piano pieces with effective harmony and well defined melodies. Some of the most popular examples of these were:
&quot;Sing, Robin&quot;, &quot;Sing - Pretty Little Song Bird&quot;, &quot;Airy Fairies&quot;, &quot;Child&#x27;s Good Night&quot;, &quot;Dollie&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;June Roses&quot;, &quot;Just a Bunch of Flowers&quot;, &quot;Mountain Pink&quot; and &quot;Dreaming Poppies&quot;.

Spaulding&#x27;s &quot;Tunes and Rhymes for the Playroom&quot;, &quot;Souvenirs of the Masters&quot;, and &quot;Well Known Fables Set to Music&quot; were among the most widely used collections of easy piano pieces in book form. &quot;A Day in Flowerdom&quot; and The &quot;Isle of Jewels&quot;, which were two little operettas for children, written by Spaulding, were also very popular. His easy piano pieces, and elementary technical books, played an important role in developing music education for children.

==Marriage and personal life==
He married Eva Bronson Wood, on 2 July 1889 in New York. They were introduced via his business partner, Kornder, as she was a friend of Kornder&#x27;s sister. Spaulding and his wife had two children.

==Death==
George Spaulding died at Roselle Park, New Jersey.

<text>Emmy Destinn ( (); 26 February 1878 – 28 January 1930) was a Czech operatic dramatic soprano. She had a career both in Europe and at the New York Metropolitan Opera. She was one of the greatest opera singers of the 19th and 20th centuries.

==Biography==

Destinn was born Emilie Pavlína Věnceslava Kittlová in Prague, in what was then Austria-Hungary. Her family soon left Prague and until the age of 14, Emmy grew up in Milešov, where her father owned mines. In 1892, she was sent to a German boarding school in Prague to learn German, playing the piano and the violin, but Anna Adamcová, a member of the National Theatre, advised her to improve her singing.

Her voice teacher since age thirteen had been Marie von Dreger Loewe-Destinn, and the young singer began using her teacher&#x27;s surname as a tribute. She was let go after the short engagement at the Dresden Opera and declined by Prague National Theatre in 1897. She debuted on 19 July 1898 at the Berlin Court Opera as Santuzza in &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;. She made such progress that the intendant of the Berlin Court Opera engaged her at once when she was brought to intendant&#x27;s notice. She was only nineteen at the time, but her voice and her acting soon won the Berlin public. Her engagement in Berlin lasted until 27 October 1909. She sang in 54 operas, including 12 premieres.

Her fame became international in 1901 when she was invited to sing the part of Senta in &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; at Germany&#x27;s Bayreuth Festspielhaus. She returned to sing the same role the next year.

Destinn made her London debut at Covent Garden&#x27;s Royal Opera House on 2 May 1904, as Donna Anna in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. She appeared there in several operas for the next two seasons, including the London premiere of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; with Caruso. Her Metropolitan Opera debut came in 1908 with an acclaimed performance of &quot;Aida&quot;, after she was released from her contract with the Berlin Court Opera. Two years later at the Met, she created the role of Minnie in the premiere of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot;, again opposite Caruso, and under the direction of Arturo Toscanini.

While she was highly successful in the lighter roles of Wagner&#x27;s operas, her &quot;spinto&quot; voice—although large in size, with a ringing top register—was better suited to German music of a less declamatory type. She also excelled in the French part of Carmen, in which she was said to rival Calvé, and in the Italian roles of Aida, Madama Butterfly and Leonora (in &quot;Il trovatore&quot;).

Destinn&#x27;s career suffered a fatal blow in World War I. She returned to her homeland after the start of the war in 1914, but her links with the patriotic Czech resistance caused her passport to be revoked. She was interned at her chateau for the remainder of the conflict. By the time that she returned to the Met in 1919, her voice had become rusty and she had been replaced in the hearts of New York audiences by a new generation of singers, although she did still continue to sing with the company until 1921.

==Last years and death==
Destinn returned to Czechoslovakia, where she married Joseph Halsbach, a Czech air-force officer, in 1923. She retired from the stage in 1926 and died from a stroke in České Budějovice, Czechoslovakia, a month before her 52nd birthday. She is interred in the Vyšehrad cemetery in Prague.

==Legacy==

Her likeness appeared in 1996 on the 2,000 Czech koruna banknote. The main-belt asteroid 6583 Destinn is named after her.

<doc id="530735" wikidata="Q4154961" url="?curid=530735" title="The Tao of Pooh">
<text>The Tao of Pooh is a 1982 book written by Benjamin Hoff. The book is intended as an introduction to the Eastern belief system of Taoism for Westerners. It allegorically employs the fictional characters of A. A. Milne&#x27;s &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; stories to explain the basic principles of philosophical Taoism. The book was on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for 49 weeks. Hoff later wrote &quot;The Te of Piglet&quot;, a companion book.

==Background==
Hoff wrote the book at night and on weekends while working as a tree pruner in the Portland Japanese Garden in Washington Park in Portland, Oregon.
==Synopsis==
The book starts with a description of the vinegar tasters, which is a painting portraying the three great eastern thinkers, Confucius, the Buddha, and Laozi over a vat of vinegar. Each tasting the vinegar of &quot;life,&quot; Confucius finds it sour, the Buddha finds it bitter, but Laozi, the traditional founder of Taoism, finds it satisfying. Then the story unfolds backing up this analogy.

Hoff presents Winnie-the-Pooh and related others from A. A. Milne&#x27;s stories as characters that interact with him while he writes &quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot;, but also quotes excerpts of their tales from Milne&#x27;s actual books &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; and &quot;The House at Pooh Corner,&quot; in order to exemplify his points to the reader and the characters. Hoff uses many of Milne&#x27;s characters to symbolize ideas that differ from or accentuate Taoist tenets. Winnie-the-Pooh himself, for example, personifies the principles of &quot;wu wei&quot;, the Taoist concept of &quot;effortless doing,&quot; and &quot;pu,&quot; the concept of being open to, but unburdened by, experience, and it is also a metaphor for natural human nature. In contrast, characters like Owl and Rabbit over-complicate problems, often over-thinking to the point of confusion, and Eeyore pessimistically complains and frets about existence, unable to just &quot;be&quot;. Hoff regards Pooh&#x27;s simpleminded nature, unsophisticated worldview and instinctive problem-solving methods as conveniently representative of the Taoist philosophical foundation. The book also incorporates translated excerpts from various prominent Taoist texts, from authors such as Laozi and Zhuang Zhou. However, one poem included in the book attributed to Lu Yu of the Tang Dynasty was actually written by Song Dynasty poet Lu You.

==Reception==
The book was on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for 49 weeks. 

It has been used as required reading in certain college courses.

==Copyright recapturing==
In April 2018, Hoff wrote a letter to his publisher informing them that he planned to recapture the copyright for &quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot; on December 15, 2018. He cited revised U.S. copyright law and explained that his reasoning for wanting to recapture the copyright was what he deemed general mistreatment by the publisher and a lack of acknowledgement of his accomplishments by them. He was able to successfully recapture the copyright. Hoff published all of the correspondence about this process on his personal website.

<doc id="530745" wikidata="Q5608390" url="?curid=530745" title="Greyfriars School">
<text>Greyfriars School is a fictional English public school used as a setting in the long-running series of stories by the writer Charles Hamilton, who wrote under the pen-name of Frank Richards. Although the stories are focused on the Remove (or lower fourth form), whose most famous pupil was Billy Bunter, other characters also featured on a regular basis.

Time is frozen in the Greyfriars stories; although the reader sees the passing of the seasons, the characters&#x27; ages do not change and they remain in the same year groups.

From 1908 to 1940, the stories appeared in &quot;The Magnet&quot;, in a total of 1,683 weekly issues. After 1940, the stories continued to appear in book form until Hamilton&#x27;s death in 1961. &quot;Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School&quot; was broadcast as a BBC television series from 19 February 1951 to 22 July 1961. A comic strip was published in &quot;Knockout&quot; (drawn by Frank Minnitt) from 1939 to 1958, and then drawn by various other artists until &quot;Knockout&quot; merged with &quot;Valiant&quot;, in which comic strips continued to appear from 23 February 1963 to 16 October 1976.

== Location ==

Greyfriars School is in the county of Kent, southeast England. The school lies on the fictional river Sark, upstream of the nearby village of Friardale and downstream of the market town of Courtfield. It is near the coast: the fishing village of Pegg is described as being within a mile (1.6 km). There are two other public schools nearby, Cliff House girls school and Highcliffe. Farther away are the towns of Lantham and Wapshott.

== Organisation ==
The school consists of seven forms, loosely based on age groups. Each form has its own Form Master, who takes the majority of the lessons. Specialist masters are used for French, sports and mathematics.

The Headmaster appoints a Head Prefect, who is responsible for leading the other Prefects and supporting the Headmaster in matters of school discipline. There is also a School Captain, who is head of school games. The School Captain is elected by a democratic vote of all members of the school. In the great majority of the stories, both positions were held by George Bernard Wingate. Similarly, each Form has a Head Boy, appointed by the Form Master and a Form Captain, elected by the Form.

Unusually, both in terms of real-life public schools and their fictional counterparts, Greyfriars School does not have a house system. In the early Magnet stories, this created a problem for the author in that inter-house rivalries are a useful source of plot conflicts in many fictional school stories. To compensate for this, Frank Richards created three separate forms of similar age groups at Greyfriars (the Lower Fourth, the Fourth and the Upper Fourth) as well as rival characters in the neighbouring Highcliffe School. As the stories developed, the time would come when plot conflicts would arise naturally from the minutely detailed characters that were fleshed out over the years.

The school is supervised by a Board of Governors, whose members include the short-tempered local landowner, Sir Hilton Popper, as well as Colonel Wharton and Major Cherry, both relatives of prominent characters in the Greyfriars Remove (Lower Fourth) form.

Boys spend most of the day in class, or in their spare time either in a common room, on the sports fields, or in shared studies; they sleep in shared dormitories. Breakfast and lunch are taken communally. A modest high tea in hall is also provided (disparagingly known as &quot;doorsteps and dishwater&quot;), but most of the boys prefer to make their own arrangements in their studies, funds permitting.

== Ethos ==
While the masters naturally emphasise scholastic matters, for the pupils (and readership) it is physical activities that are at the heart of the school&#x27;s ethos. Prowess at sports is the best route to popularity and respect, while over-attainment at study is something of lesser, if not negative, importance. Disputes are often settled by fights, with the invariable, if unrealistic, outcome that virtue triumphs over vice. Corporal punishment is widely used by the masters and by the Sixth Form prefects. The ultimate punishment, short of expulsion, is a birching administered by the saintly headmaster, Dr Locke. Lesser punishments are lines (copying out a hundred lines from a Latin text by the classical author Virgil), or for really serious infractions among the older forms a &quot;book&quot; (copying out a complete Latin text by Virgil, which might be up to 952 lines). There is also a Punishment Room (&quot;Punny&quot;) which, in rare and particularly serious cases, may be used to keep an offender in solitary confinement for a number of days.

== Style and themes ==
Hamilton&#x27;s writing style has been compared with that of his contemporary P G Wodehouse. A light and distinctive prose style combines with a strong comedic element and a large ensemble of strongly-drawn characters. The exceptional volume of material produced by Hamilton over his writing career allowed both characters and locations to be developed in great depth.

Observations of contemporary life and satire are found in Hamilton&#x27;s work, and he frequently uses his characters as mouthpieces to make telling ironic points:

In particular, he had little respect for professions or pretensions, and politicians, lawyers and stockbrokers are regularly at the sharp end of his cynical prose.

Time is frozen in the Greyfriars stories; although the reader sees the passing of the seasons, the characters&#x27; ages do not change and the students remain in the same year groups.

The style of the stories evolved over the years. For the first decade, the stories tended to be complete episodes. This was also a development period in which the author established his style. During the 1920s, the format gradually changed to serials; this was also a period of character development in which many of the large cast of characters were given their own storylines in turn. Many commentators agree that the &quot;golden age&quot; of Greyfriars stories was in the period 1930 to 1934, when the standard of plotlines and mellow humour reached its peak; while after 1934, the high standard of plot construction continued, but plots and themes were increasingly repeated.

Hamilton&#x27;s work has attracted criticism, most notably from George Orwell in a 1940 essay published in &quot;Horizon&quot; magazine. Orwell described Hamilton&#x27;s style as easily imitated (to facilitate substitute writers), plagiarist, and largely comprising shallow right wing content. He also expressed incredulity that stories spanning 30 years could have been authored by the same individual. The key passage in his essay, which was to provoke a strong response from Hamilton, is reproduced below.

Hamilton&#x27;s response to this criticism was presented in an article published in the same magazine shortly afterwards, in which he rebutted each of Orwell&#x27;s points.

Other commentators have challenged the view that Hamilton&#x27;s work can be narrowly categorised as right wing, drawing attention to examples of his output that demonstrate strong independent views. Over the years, Hamilton was ever ready to air unfashionable causes to his young audience, but did so in a way that did not attract controversy or jeopardise publication of his stories. Anti-capitalism, early Socialism, the Suffragette movement and conscientious objectors during World War I all received sympathetic treatment in Hamilton&#x27;s work. In an age when the word &quot;nigger&quot; was not yet regarded in the same pejorative sense that applies today, Hamilton&#x27;s work consistently emphasised the offensive nature of the term from as early as 1922; and his output even included unfashionable anti-British sentiments in stories set against the background of imperial India.

== Main recurring characters ==
Although the full ensemble of recurring characters in the Greyfriars world is in the hundreds, a smaller group of fewer than 20 recurring characters, along with guest characters, drive the majority of the stories. Each of the following characters appears in more than 800 Magnet stories (approximately half of the total of 1,683).

===Lower Fourth Form (Remove)===
The main characters in the stories are to be found in the Lower Fourth Form, known as the Remove.
* William George Bunter – known as Billy Bunter, is the best known character in the stories. He was initially conceived as a minor character, but developed into one of the principal characters of the stories as his comic potential was realised. His big round spectacles and rolling gait earned him the nickname the &quot;&#x27;Owl of the Remove&#x27;&quot;. Foolish, greedy, deceitful, comically conceited, but essentially harmless. Among his few virtues are an occasional tendency to display courage for the sake of others (invariably while being terrified himself); a genuine love and concern for his mother; and, oddly enough, generosity, on the rare occasions when he is in possession of food or cash. Appears in 1,670 stories and introduced in Magnet No. 1 &quot;The Making of Harry Wharton&quot; (15 February 1908).
* The Famous Five – a quintet of friends comprising Harry Wharton (Remove Head Boy and Form Captain), his closest friend Frank Nugent , cheery and boisterous Bob Cherry , Indian Prince Hurree Jamset Ram Singh and plain-speaking Johnny Bull from Yorkshire. All strong sportsmen, they are the &quot;de facto&quot; leaders of the Greyfriars Remove. Wharton and Nugent were both introduced in Magnet No. 1 &quot;The Making of Harry Wharton&quot; (15 February 1908) and are the only two characters to appear in all 1,683 Magnet stories; while Cherry was introduced in Magnet No. 2 &quot;The Taming of Harry&quot; (22 February 1908) and appears in 1,682 Magnet stories.
* Percival Bolsover - originally introduced as an unpleasant bully, though has calmed over time. Now shares a study with French junior Napoleon Dupont, his one true friend, whom he protects from bullying. Appears in 856 stories and first introduced in Magnet No. 182 &quot;The Cock of the Walk&quot; (5 August 1911).
* Peter Hazeldene - weak and vacillating, earning him the early nickname of &quot;Vaseline&quot;. Later known simply as &quot;Hazel&quot;. His sister is schoolgirl Marjorie Hazeldene, whose popularity among many Greyfriars boys leads them to show more patience towards her brother than he perhaps deserves. Appears in 834 stories and first introduced in Magnet No. 2 &quot;The Taming of Harry&quot; (22 February 1908).
* Lord Mauleverer – outwardly, a languid aristocratic millionaire with a sleepy demeanour. But there are hidden depths to “Mauly” - his keen judgement of human character and simple faith in human nature have led him more than once to show loyalty to friends in adverse circumstances. On such occasions he reveals an astute mind and considerable leadership qualities, along with a talent for boxing that is a match for anyone in the form. Appears in 922 stories and first introduced in Magnet No. 184 &quot;The Schoolboy Millionaire&quot; (19 August 1911).
* Harold Skinner – one of the most unpleasant characters at Greyfriars – cowardly, malicious and with unwholesome vices such as smoking and gambling. The perpetrator of cruelly accurate cartoons and malicious practical jokes. Appears in 1,232 stories and first introduced in Magnet No. 1 &quot;The Making of Harry Wharton&quot; (15 February 1908).
* Sidney James Snoop - a weak character, very much under Skinner&#x27;s unhealthy influence. Appears in 887 stories and first introduced in Magnet No. 45 &quot;A Lad from Lancashire&quot; (19 December 1908).
* Peter Hastings Todd – a tall, thin, budding lawyer who is the son of a Clerkenwell solicitor. Devotes much of his time to improving Bunter: a futile, fruitless and frustrating occupation. Appears in 1,039 stories and first introduced in Magnet No. 205 &quot;The Duffer&#x27;s Double&quot; (13 January 1912).
* Herbert Tudor Vernon-Smith– a charismatic but reckless and quick-tempered character who features prominently in the stories. A natural leader, both on and off the sports field, but with a hard and selfish streak. Has too much money, thanks to the indulgence of his millionaire father, which allows him to follow a rebellious lifestyle that has earned him the nickname &quot;The Bounder&quot;. Much improved by his friendship with Tom Redwing who was introduced in 1918. Appears in 1,279 stories and first introduced in Magnet No. 119 &quot;The Bounder of Greyfriars&quot; (21 May 1910).

===Other Greyfriars characters===
* The Reverend Dr. Herbert Henry Locke - venerable Headmaster of Greyfriars School. Wise, respected, but sometimes unworldly. Appears in 970 stories and first introduced in Magnet No. 1 &quot;The Making of Harry Wharton&quot; (15 February 1908).
* Horace Coker - clumsy, loud and opinionated Fifth Former. Convinced of his intellectual superiority and sporting prowess, an opinion that is strangely shared by nobody except his adoring Aunt Judy, who keeps him well supplied with cash and food hampers. Appears in 882 stories and first introduced in Magnet No. 143 &quot;The Head of Study 14&quot; (5 November 1910).
* Henry Samuel Quelch - the Remove Form Master, and as such the most prominent Master in the Greyfriars stories. A scholarly gentleman, a confirmed bachelor, and a man of strong character respected by the boys in his Form. A strict disciplinarian and frequently described as &quot;a beast, but a just beast.&quot; A keen walker, spends much of his spare time working on his monumental work, &quot;The History of Greyfriars&quot;. Appears in 1,383 stories and first introduced in Magnet No.1 &quot;The Making of Harry Wharton&quot; (15 February 1908).
* George Wingate - popular and highly respected Greyfriars Head Prefect and School Captain. Appears in 1,112 stories and first introduced in Magnet No.1 &quot;The Making of Harry Wharton&quot; (15 February 1908).

== Storylines ==
The extraordinary volume of output of Greyfriars stories inevitably meant that plotlines and themes were repeated, though usually involving different characters and novel twists. In the early years, this often meant stories that were resolved across 1–2 issues; but by the early 1930s a series would typically take 8–12 weekly issues to play out.

=== Characters with double lives ===
An oft-repeated theme involves the arrival of a new character at the school who turns out to be not quite what he seems.
Dick Lancaster joins the Greyfriars Sixth form in 1931 (Magnets Nos. 1209 to 1219) and immediately becomes one of the most popular men in the school: handsome, easy going and a fine cricketer. Unknown to his schoolfellows though, he is also the “Wizard” – a member of a criminal gang of burglars who is particularly skilled at safe-cracking.

Greyfriars turns out to be highly popular as a base for disguised burglars. The “Courtfield Cracksman” (Magnets Nos. 1138 to 1151) conceals himself by finding employment on the Greyfriars staff in 1930; as does “Jimmy the One” (Magnets Nos.1247 to 1255) in 1931, and “Slim Jim” (Magnets Nos. 1660 to 1675) in 1939. In two of these cases Herbert Vernon-Smith has his suspicions – in one case he is proved right, and ends up in danger as a result; in the other case he is disastrously wrong, suspecting the undercover detective assigned to the case and befriending the real villain.

=== Rivals for a fortune ===
A variation on the former theme was the arrival of a new boy who turns out to be the secret enemy of an established Greyfriars character. Usually this involved a rivalry over an inheritance. An early example was the “Da Costa” series of 1928 (Magnets Nos. 1059 to 1067), when new arrival Arthur Da Costa attempts to disgrace Harry Wharton in an attempt to disinherit him of a large fortune. This plotline was repeated a number of times.

Coker&#x27;s younger cousin, Edgar Caffyn, one of the most unpleasant characters ever to appear in the stories, arrives at the school in 1935 (Magnets Nos. 1404 to 1412) with the intention of getting Coker expelled and replacing him as Aunt Judy&#x27;s heir. It is Billy Bunter&#x27;s turn in 1938, when his relation Arthur Carter, having been expelled from his previous school, has been disinherited by a wealthy uncle. He comes to Greyfriars with the intention of disgracing Bunter, his uncle&#x27;s new adopted heir (Magnets Nos. 1561 to 1572). In all of these storylines, the rascally newcomer is aided and abetted by an even more rascally lawyer.

Finally, in 1939, Herbert Vernon-Smith&#x27;s relative Bertie Vernon arrives at the school. Vernon is startlingly similar to Vernon-Smith in appearance, which allows a number of dramatic situations to develop before Vernon&#x27;s real purpose in coming to Greyfriars is revealed.

===Doppelgängers===
Many storylines have involved the arrival at Greyfriars of a relative who bears a startling resemblance to an existing character. Usually, the two doppelgängers are of opposite character types, and are continuously mistaken for each other, enabling a number of plot conflicts to develop. As well as the Bertie Vernon series, mentioned above, other doppelgängers have included Billy Bunter&#x27;s cousin Wally, Peter Todd&#x27;s cousin Alonzo and Harry Wharton&#x27;s relative Ralph Stacey (Magnets Nos. 1422 to 1433). The Stacey series, in particular, is rated by many commentators as being among the finest Greyfriars series written by Hamilton.

=== The rebellious Remove ===
The Remove included a number of naturally rebellious characters and several plotlines exploited this to the full. A typical storyline would involve an act of injustice or tyranny resulting in the juniors rising up in open rebellion against authority.

One of the first examples was the &quot;Judge Jeffreys&quot; series of 1917 (Magnets Nos. 501 to 505), in which a new head master, Mr Jeffreys, institutes a severe punishment regime, causing the Remove to lead a rebellion against his rule that ends in Mr Jeffreys being driven out by the whole school.

The “High Oaks Rebellion” series of 1928 (Magnets Nos. 1043 to 1049) sees Mr Quelch, the Remove Master, unjustly dismissed from the school through a malicious trick by Skinner. Led and financed by Lord Mauleverer, the Remove walk out of Greyfriars, set up their own school at High Oaks and defend it against a number of attempts to forcibly return them to Greyfriars.

The &quot;Brander&quot; series, from 1930 (Magnets Nos. 1169 to 1174) is a particularly notable example of this story type. Newcomer Otto van Tromp grievously injures Dr. Locke in an unscrupulous scheme to install his uncle, Mr. Brander, as the new headmaster of Greyfriars. In this, the pair enlist the assistance of the debt-laden chairman of the Greyfriars governors, Sir Hilton Popper, who owes money to Brander. Van Tromp becomes head prefect and abuses his position to such an extent that the Remove rise up in open rebellion and barricade themselves in the Remove passage. They are eventually joined by characters from other forms in the school, including fifth formers and prefects. Mr. Quelch, meanwhile, is dismissed by Brander, but invokes the school statutes that allow a dismissed master of long standing to remain at the school until his appeal is heard by the governors.

In 1934, Billy Bunter is expelled after being unjustly blamed for drenching Mr Prout in ink (Magnets Nos. 1374 to 1382). The Remove rise up in his support and build a fortified camp on Popper Island, which they successfully defend against a number of assaults by the prefects and other seniors.

Later in the same year, Headmaster Dr Locke and several senior prefects are hospitalised following a motor accident. Fifth form master Mr Prout takes over as temporary headmaster and appoints the bullying Gerald Loder as Head Prefect; as a result, a tyrannical regime develops at the school. Prompted by Vernon-Smith, the juniors form a secret society, the Secret Seven, to fight back. Although the Secret Seven has over 30 members, only 7, wearing masks, are ever seen to take part in active operations at any one time. The Magnet gave away a number of detective-themed promotional gifts over the course of the series which were featured in the narrative of the stories.

After Dr Locke is again incapacitated in 1937, the temporary headmastership passes this time to Mr Hacker, unpopular Master of the Shell, who is supported by Sixth form bully Arthur Carne. The resultant tyranny again prompts the Remove to fight back; this time, they march out of the school and barricade themselves in the tuckshop (Magnets Nos. 1510 to 1515).

=== Travel series ===
The summer holiday break, between the summer and Michaelmas terms, saw the Greyfriars juniors depart on a number of adventures away from the school. Frequently, this involved travel overseas.

The early Magnets saw some short trips to Europe, but it was not until 1922 that the first proper foreign travel series appeared. In Magnets Nos. 768 to 774 the juniors travel with Bob Cherry&#x27;s cousin to Africa in search of buried ivory. The juniors revisited Africa with Mr Vernon-Smith in 1931 (Magnets Nos. 1228 to 1236).

In the India series of 1926 (Magnets Nos. 960 to 970) the juniors travel to Bhanipur with Colonel Wharton to ensure Hurree Singh&#x27;s throne is kept safe against the machinations of foreign spies.

In 1927, the juniors visit the South Seas in Mr Vernon-Smith&#x27;s yacht (Magnets Nos. 1017 to 1026), in search of Black Peter&#x27;s treasure, which will make Redwing financially independent. The juniors revisited the Southern seas in 1938 (Magnets Nos. 1588 to 1598)

The longest foreign travel series came in 1929 (Magnets Nos. 1092 to 1107), when Mr Fish took a party of juniors and seniors all the way across the United States to Hollywood to make a school film. Though the trip was sold to the school and parents as educational, the primary purpose of the trip was to make films with real schoolboys without paying them Hollywood rates. The juniors went to the US for a second time in 1938 (Magnets Nos.1573 to 1582), this time to Texas, where they encountered another of Charles Hamilton&#x27;s characters, the Rio Kid.

The Egypt series of 1932 (Magnets Nos. 1277 to 1284) follows the adventures of Billy Bunter, accompanied by Lord Mauleverer and the Famous Five, across Europe and the Mediterranean Sea to the North African deserts (a locale previously visited in the Sahara series of 1925). They are pursued by the villain Konstantine Kalizelos, who is convinced the schoolboys have a clue to the whereabouts of a fabulous lost jewel. Author Charles Hamilton never visited Egypt, and the authenticity of many of the descriptions and scenes in this series is remarkable. In particular, the characterisation of two Egyptians, the millionaire Hilmi Maroudi and the lower caste guide, Hassan the Dragoman, has won acclaim. These stories were partially reprinted in the Schoolboys Own Libraries before World War II and again by Armada in the 1970s, but both omitted the conclusion of the series.

The China Series of 1930 begins with the Remove junior, Wun Lung, menaced by the distant Chinese mandarin Tang Wang. Accompanied by Billy Bunter, the Famous Five and the detective Ferrers Locke, he returns to China via Hong Kong and Singapore. A series of adventures ensues. The author draws a vivid picture of a very different China ruled by Mandarins – a colourful land rich in history and ancient customs.

== In other fiction ==
Greyfriars, and some of its (by then) former pupils, appeared in &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: The Black Dossier&quot;.

George Harbinger is a fictional civil servant in &quot;The Secret Servant&quot; by Gavin Lyall. He refers to the intelligence services of Warsaw Pact member states using language in the style of Charles Hamilton, such as &quot;cads and rotters&quot; to indicate their agents in the UK, and &quot;Greyfriars&quot; to indicate their various headquarters (particularly the Lubyanka Building as the activities of the satellite states&#x27; services are assumed to be directed by the KGB).

<doc id="530756" wikidata="Q194536" url="?curid=530756" title="Desert bandicoot">
<text>The desert bandicoot (Perameles eremiana) is an extinct bandicoot of the arid country in the centre of Australia.

==Taxonomy==
The description by Walter Baldwin Spencer was published in 1897, using a specimen provided by a European correspondent, Mr. Gillen, who had settled at Alice Springs. The holotype was placed at the National Museum in Melbourne. 
The type location was determined as the Burt Plain, an area north of Alice in South Australia.

The status as species is uncertain: it was proposed by L. Freedman in 1967 to represent a clinal form of a &quot;P. bougainville&quot; population, yet recognised in a revision of &quot;Perameles&quot; phylogeny in 2012. Names of the species by indigenous peoples of the central desert were reported by Spencer as &quot;mulgaruquirra&quot; at Alice Springs and &quot;iwurra&quot; at Charlotte Waters. 
Common names for the species also include orange-backed bandicoot and &quot;waliya&quot;, the latter adopted from a traditional name at the Warburton region.

==Description==
A species of &quot;Perameles&quot; which, like the &quot;Isoodon&quot; of the bandicoot family Peramelidae, are terrestrial and somewhat quadrupedal foragers that use short forelimbs to excavate the ground. The hind limbs resemble the macropods, roos and wallabies, and the syndactyly that is typical of diprotodonts, the combined second and third toes of the hindfeet. The body is small and head that is proportionally long, narrow and pointed to suit its use in investigating the sand while digging. Like other peramelids, the pelage of &quot;Perameles eremiana&quot; is composed of coarse and stiff hair, the coloration of this species is a dull orange with darker bands over the rump. They most closely resemble the western barred bandicoot &quot;Perameles bougainville&quot;, most readily distinguished by a rufous-orange coloration at the flanks, face and rump. dark brown fur covered most of the upper and lower parts of the feet at the front and hind limbs. The tails of &quot;Perameles&quot; are comparatively short, but in this species it was relatively longer, measuring 77–135 millimetres, and fur at the upper-side was dark brown; the end of the tail tapers to a point.

The range of measurements for specimens of &quot;P. eremiana&quot; are 180 to 285 mm for head and body length combined, and their weight is estimated to be around 205 grams.
Like other peramelids, the females have a rear facing pouch and possessed eight teats, the number of young may also have been as many as four although the only reports are of a female bearing two young. The distinctive characters of &quot;P. eremiana&quot;, the coloration, hair on the lower surface of the foot and longer pointed ears are thought to be adaptations suited to its arid environment of central Australian deserts. 
Its diet is not known with certainty, but has been reported to include ants, beetle larvae, and termites.

==Distribution and habitat==
The last known specimen was collected in 1943 on the Canning Stock Route in Western Australia, and the species is presumed to be extinct.
Their first specimens, from the Alice Springs area, were described in 1897. It appears to have been common in the remote north-west of South Australia, the south-west of the Northern Territory, and the central part of Western Australia at least until the 1930s. Unconfirmed reports suggest that its range may have extended to the Tanami Desert and the arid Western Australian coast between Broome and Port Hedland.

Favoured habitat was sandy desert dominated by spinifex vegetation, &quot;Triodia&quot; species and other tussock grasses, on dunes or sand-plains. It appears to have disappeared between about 1943 and 1960. While the cause of its decline remains uncertain, it is thought to be related to the changed burning regimes that followed the removal of Aboriginal people from the central Australian deserts. Another factor may have been the introduction of the red fox in Australia.
The species succumbed to the variety of threatening factors associated with the collapse of mammal populations in Western Australia (1875–1925). A study that modelled its decline when attributed to an epizootic event, an unknown disease that was reported at the time, found that &quot;Perameles eremiana&quot; would have had no immunity to its impact.

The detailed habits of the species are unknown, but assumed to be similar to the extant western barred bandicoot. 
They were found in areas also inhabited by the golden bandicoot &quot;Isoodon auratus&quot;.

A simple burrow was lined with sticks and leaves, scraped or dug at the ground beneath a shrub or spinifex tussock, and this provided refuge while it rested during the day. Foraging activity was nocturnal, and like other bandicoots, left a conical hole as it dug and investigated an area with its claws and long snout. This bandicoot was eaten by indigenous peoples, who captured the animal by blocking the entrance of its nest with one foot and removing the trapped animal by hand.

<text>Joseph Edward Brennan (November 2, 1934 – April 6, 2024) was an American lawyer and politician from Maine. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 70th governor of Maine from 1979 to 1987 and in the United States House of Representatives for from 1987 to 1991. Brennan was a commissioner on the Federal Maritime Commission during the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama administrations.

== Early life ==
Brennan was born on November 2, 1934, in Portland, Maine. He lived on Kellogg Street, on the third floor of tenement housing on Munjoy Hill. He was raised in a family of eight children, with his parents being Irish immigrants. Brennan graduated from Cheverus High School, Boston College, and the University of Maine School of Law. Brennan served in the United States Army from 1953 to 1955.

== Government service ==
=== Early career ===
Brennan won election to the Maine House of Representatives in 1964, and served three terms. When first elected to the Maine House he did not own a car and hitchhiked up from Portland. In 1970, he was elected county attorney for Cumberland County. When he was District Attorney, his Munjoy Hill house was shot up, with bullets landing by his infant daughter. This led Brennan to support the ban on assault-style weapons in the United States. He was elected to the Maine Senate in 1972.

=== Attorney General and Governor of Maine ===

Brennan ran for governor of Maine in 1974; he lost the Democratic nomination to George J. Mitchell. The Maine Legislature selected Brennan to be the Maine Attorney General on January 2, 1975. As attorney general, Brennan took part in negotiations with both Wabanaki tribes and the federal government on what became the Maine Indian Land Claims Settlement Act of 1980, a federal law enacted during the presidency of Jimmy Carter. Brennan ran for governor again in 1978, winning the primary and general elections by 49,631 votes. Brennan was reelected in 1982 by 108,117 votes, serving as governor from 1979 to 1987. As governor, Brennan launched education reforms, pressed for tough highway safety measures, and helped to establish the Finance Authority of Maine. Among the notable people Brennan appointed as governor were renowned Maine U.S. Senator George J. Mitchell and future Governor of Maine Janet T. Mills, whom Brennan appointed as the first female district attorney in the New England region.

=== U. S. Representative ===
In 1986, Brennan ran for the U.S. House in and defeated Republican Rollin Ives with 53% of the vote. in 1988 Brennan was reelected by a margin of 63% to 37%. 

=== Later gubernatorial and Senate camp === 
Brennan ran for governor again in 1990, losing to Republican John McKernan. He ran again in 1994, losing to Independent Angus King, but placing second, ahead of Republican Susan Collins. He faced Collins in another statewide election in 1996, running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Bill Cohen, which Collins won.

=== Later career ===
In 1999, President Bill Clinton nominated Brennan to serve as a commissioner on the Federal Maritime Commission, a small independent agency that regulates shipping between the U.S. and foreign countries. He was re-nominated by President George W. Bush and confirmed for a second term at the FMC in 2004.

==Personal life and death==
Joe married Connie LaPointe Brennan in 1994. Joe had two children :J. B. Brennan, who is a 25-year veteran of the United States Secret Service, and Dr. Tara Brennan, who holds a Doctorate of Psychology from LIU Brooklyn.

Brennan died of natural causes at his home in Munjoy Hill, on the night of April 6, 2024, at the age of 89.

<doc id="530768" wikidata="Q277074" url="?curid=530768" title="Earth-leakage circuit breaker">
<text>An earth-leakage circuit breaker (ELCB) is a safety device used in electrical installations to prevent shock. It consists of either a current sensing mechanism, or a voltage sensing mechanism. Such a protection mechanism may be found in the form of distribution board modules, standalone devices, and special sockets (aka &quot;receptacles&quot;).

Voltage-operated ELCBs can still be found in the wild, though these largely fell out of favour after the invention of the current-sensing based RCD (aka GFCI) technology.

==History==
Early ELCBs, first introduced about sixty years ago, were voltage operated devices (VO-ELCBs), detecting a voltage rise between installation metalwork and an external electrode.

If the wrong type was used on an installation, the level of protection given could be substantially less than that intended, in particular the voltage operated type can only protect against faults or shocks to metalwork connected to the circuit ground, connected to the VO-ELCB, it cannot detect current leaving a live wire and running to ground by another path, such as via a person standing on the Earth.

These were later replaced by current sensing devices about forty years ago. For some time afterwards both forms were referred to as ELCBs which brought some confusion. To address this the IEC introduced the term &quot;residual current device (RCD)&quot;. Residual current refers to any residue when comparing current in the outbound and return currents in the circuit. In single phase circuits this is simply the or phase current minus the neutral current. In a 3 phase circuit all current carrying conductors must be sensed.

In modern literature the term ELCB is sometimes incorrectly used to specifically refer to VO-ELCBs, while almost never used to refer to current sensing devices, which are almost exclusively referred to instead by terms such as RCD, RCCB and GFCI.

==Operation==
An ELCB is a specialised type of latching relay that has a building&#x27;s incoming mains power connected through its switching contacts so that the ELCB disconnects the power when earth leakage is detected.

The ELCB detects fault currents between and earth (ground) conductors within the portion of the installation it protects. If sufficient characteristics of a fault appear across the ELCB&#x27;s sensing mechanism, then it will switch off the power, and remain off until manually reset.

===Voltage-operated devices===

A voltage-operated ELCB detects a rise in potential between the protected interconnected metalwork (equipment frames, conduits, enclosures) and a distant isolated Earth reference electrode. They operate at a detected potential of around 50 volts to open a main breaker and isolate the supply from the protected premises.

A voltage-operated ELCB has a second terminal for connecting to the remote reference Earth connection.

The Earth circuit is modified when an ELCB is used; the connection to the Earth rod is passed through the ELCB by connecting to its two Earth terminals. One terminal goes to the installation Earth CPC (circuit protective conductor, aka Earth wire), and the other to the Earth rod (or sometimes other type of Earth connection).

===Current sensing devices===

RCDs exist in multiple sub-types, but the most basic form simply consists of a current transformer, in which the and neutral conductors for the circuit are wound around a toroidal transformer core, and should there be a current leak between and earth (ground), bypassing neutral, the imbalance in current flow between the and neutral will cause a magnetic flux in the core, which then, if strong enough, activates a relay that opens the switch.

==Comparison==
Advantages of voltage-sensing devices over current-sensing: 
* They are less sensitive to fault conditions, and therefore have fewer nuisance trips. (This does not mean they always do, as practical performance depends on installation details and the discrimination enhancing filtering in the devices.) Therefore, by electrically separating cable armour from the cable circuit protective conductor, a devices can be arranged to protect against cable damage only, and not trip on faults in downstream installations. 
* Voltage sensing devices will also trip on DC current faults to ground which a transformer interfaced RCD/RCCB is unable to sense, with similar issues with frequencies significantly above mains frequency. This may lead to ground faults on variable speed drives between the drive electronics and motor not being detected for example.

Disadvantages of voltage-sensing devices over current-sensing: 
* A wire break in the fault to load section, or in the earth to ground section, will disable operation of the devices.
* Requirement of an additional third wire from the load to the devices.
* Separate devices cannot be grounded individually.
* Any additional connection to Earth on the protected system can disable the detector.
* Additional resistance and an additional point of failure added into the Earthing system.
* The devices senses equipment faults and cannot detect if a person accidentally touches an energized part of the devices.

==Earth bypassing==
It is not unusual for an ELCB protected installation to have a second unintentional connection to Earth somewhere, one that does not pass through the ELCB sense coil. This can occur via metal pipework in contact with the ground, metal structural framework, outdoor home appliances in contact with soil, and so on.

When such a secondary connection is present, fault current may pass to Earth without being sensed by the ELCB. Despite this, perhaps counter-intuitively, the operation of the ELCB is not compromised. The purpose of the ELCB is to prevent Earthed metalwork rising to a dangerous voltage during fault conditions, and the ELCB continues to do this just the same, the ELCB will still cut the power at the same CPC voltage level. (The difference is that higher fault current is then needed to reach this voltage.)

==Nuisance trips==
While voltage and current on the protective earth conductor is usually fault current from a live wire, this is not always the case, thus there are situations in which an ELCB can nuisance trip.

When an installation has two connections to Earth, a nearby high current lightning strike will cause a voltage gradient in the soil, presenting the ELCB sense coil with enough voltage to cause it to trip.

If the installation&#x27;s Earth rod is placed close to the Earth rod of a neighbouring building, a high Earth leakage current in the other building can raise the local ground potential and cause a voltage difference across the two Earths, again tripping the ELCB. Close Earth rods are unsuitable for ELCB use for this reason, but in real life such installations are sometimes encountered.

Both RCDs and ELCBs are prone to nuisance trips from normal harmless Earth leakage to some degree. On one hand ELCBs are on average older, and hence tend to have less well developed filtering against nuisance trips, and on the other hand ELCBs are inherently immune to some of the causes of false trips RCDs suffer, and are generally less sensitive than RCDs. In practice RCD nuisance trips are much more common.

Another cause of nuisance tripping is due to accumulated or burden currents caused by items with lowered insulation resistance. This may occur due to older equipment, or equipment with heating elements, or even wiring in buildings in the tropics where prolonged damp and rain conditions can cause the insulation resistance to lower due to moisture tracking. If there is a 30 mA protective device in use and there is a 10 mA burden from various sources then the unit will trip at 20 mA. The individual items may each be electrically safe but a large number of small burden currents accumulates and reduces the tripping level. This was more a problem in past installations where multiple circuits were protected by a single ELCB.

Heating elements of the tubular form are filled with a very fine powder that can absorb moisture if the element has not be used for some time. In the tropics, this may occur, for example if a clothes drier has not been used for a year or a large water boiler used for coffee, etc. has been in storage. In such cases, if the unit is allowed to power up without RCD protection then it will normally dry out and successfully pass inspection. This type of problem can be seen even with brand new equipment.

==Failure to respond==
Some ELCBs do not respond to rectified fault current. This issue is the same in principle with VO-ELCBs and RCDs, but VO-ELCBs are on average much older and specifications have improved considerably over the years, so an old VO-ELCB is more likely to have some fault current waveform that it will not respond to.

With any mechanical device, failures occur, and ELCBs should ideally be tested periodically to ensure they still work.

If either of the Earth wires become disconnected from the VO-ELCB, it will no longer trip and the installation will often no longer be properly Earthed.

<text>The Subaru B9 Scrambler (also known as the Subaru B9SC) is an open two-seat concept sports car from Subaru featuring classic styling. It is long and powered by a gasoline-electric hybrid engine. It was designed by Andreas Zapatinas.

==Design==

This concept car was first shown in 2003 at the Tokyo Motor Show. It was designed with influence from Subaru&#x27;s aircraft heritage, with the front end appearing to look like the cross section of an airliner, with a central jet intake and wings. This theme was originally developed for the Subaru B11S which had been exhibited in Spring 2003. The lower panels of the B9 are dent resistant. 

&quot;Car and Driver&quot; speculated the Pontiac Solstice roadster could have been based on the same platform as the B9 Scrambler, as General Motors held a minority stake in Subaru&#x27;s parent company, Fuji Heavy Industries, from 1999 to 2005.

==Technical==

The automobile features a 2.0 litre flat-4 cylinder hybrid powertrain, which Subaru calls the Sequential Series Hybrid Electric Vehicle (SSHEV). In the SSHEV, the electric motor alone is used to move the car up to , at which point the gasoline engine takes over. Under , the gasoline engine may be used to charge the battery or under heavy acceleration. It is Subaru&#x27;s first hybrid powertrain, and Subaru president Kyoji Takenaka stated that existing conventionally-powered Subaru models required &quot;no modification&quot; to install the SSHEV.

The ride height can be adjusted through a self-leveling air suspension. Front and rear-facing cameras, coupled with a radar system are used in an intelligent cruise control and lane departure warning system.

<text>Fritz the Cat is a comic strip created by Robert Crumb. Set in a &quot;supercity&quot; of anthropomorphic animals, it focused on Fritz, a tabby cat who frequently went on wild adventures that sometimes involved sexual escapades. Crumb began drawing the character in homemade comic books as a child, and Fritz would become one of his best-known characters.

The strip first appeared in &quot;Help!&quot; and &quot;Cavalier&quot; magazines, and subsequently in publications associated with the underground comix scene between 1965 and 1972; &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; comic compilations elevated it to one of the underground scene&#x27;s most iconic features.

&quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; received further attention when it was adapted into a 1972 animated film of the same name. The directorial debut of animator Ralph Bakshi, it was the first animated feature film to receive an X rating in the United States, and the most successful independent animated feature to date. Crumb ended the strip later that year due to disagreements with the filmmakers.

&quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; was created in 1959 by Robert Crumb in a homemade comic book story called &quot;Cat Life&quot;, based on the experiences of Fred, the family cat. The character&#x27;s next appearance was in a 1960 story entitled &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. By this point, the cat had become anthropomorphic and had been renamed Fritz, a name derived from a minor unrelated character who appeared briefly in &quot;Cat Life&quot;. Fritz appeared in the early 1960s &quot;Animal Town&quot; strips drawn by Charles and Robert Crumb. Sometimes Fritz was accompanied by Fuzzy the Bunny, who served as an alter ego for Charles, his creator.

&quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; is set in a &quot;modern &#x27;supercity&#x27; of millions of animals.&quot; Stories begin simply and become increasingly chaotic and complex as the narrative responds to uncontrollable forces. The look of &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; comics was characterized by the use of the Rapidograph technical pen and a simple drawing style Robert Crumb used to facilitate his storytelling. Crumb states that much of the comic books he enjoyed as a child were talking animal comics, particularly those of Carl Barks. Crumb was later influenced by Walt Kelly&#x27;s daily anthropomorphic animal comic strip &quot;Pogo&quot;; Crumb did not copy Kelly&#x27;s comics directly, but states that he imitated his drawing style closely; Crumb admired Kelly&#x27;s storytelling style, which &quot;seemed [to be] plotless and casually done. The characters talked to each other and nothing much happened. Just a lot of foolishness takes place&quot;. Crumb said of his anthropomorphic work:

I can express something [with animals] that is different from what I put into my work about humans ... I can put more nonsense, more satire and fantasy into the animals ... they&#x27;re also easier to do than people ... With people I try more for realism, which is probably why I&#x27;m generally better with animals.

In 1964, when he was not working at American Greetings, Crumb drew many &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; strips for his own amusement. Some of them were later published in &quot;Help!&quot; and &quot;Cavalier&quot; magazines and in underground comix. Fritz also appears briefly in Crumb&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Big Yum Yum Book: The Story of Oggie and the Beanstalk&quot;, drawn in 1964, but not published until 1975. Several characters from the anthropomorphic universe of &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; appeared in another Crumb comic strip, &quot;The Silly Pigeons&quot;, drawn in 1965 and intended for &quot;Help!&quot; In 1970, Crumb redrew an early Fuzzy the Bunny story written by Charles Crumb in 1952; it was published in &quot;Zap Comix&quot; #5.

==Characters==
Marty Pahls, Crumb&#x27;s childhood friend, describes Fritz as &quot;a poseur&quot;, whose posturing was taken seriously by everyone around him. Fritz is self-centered and hedonistic, lacking both morals and ethics. Thomas Albright describes Fritz as &quot;a kind of updated Felix with overtones of Charlie Chaplin, Candide, and Don Quixote.&quot; Fritz had a &quot;glib, smooth and self-assured&quot; personality, characteristics Crumb felt he himself lacked. According to Pahls, &quot;To a great extent, Fritz was his wish-fulfillment ... [the character allowed Robert to] do great deeds, have wild adventures, and undergo a variety of sex experiences, which he himself felt he couldn&#x27;t. Fritz was bold, poised, had a way with the ladies—all attributes which Robert coveted, but felt he lacked.&quot;

Crumb denied any personal attachment to the character, stating, &quot;I just got into drawing him ... He was fun to draw.&quot; As Crumb&#x27;s personal life changed, Fritz&#x27;s did too. According to Pahls, &quot;For years, [Crumb] had few friends and no sex life; he was forced to spend many hours at school or on the job, and when he came home he &#x27;escaped&#x27; by drawing home-made comics. When he suddenly found a group of friends that would accept him for himself, as he did in Cleveland in 1964, the &#x27;compensation&#x27; factor went out of his drawing, and this was pretty much the end of Fritz&#x27;s .&quot;

An early untitled 10-page story, drawn in 1964 and released in 1969 as part of &quot;R. Crumb&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; (Rip Off Press), depicts Fritz as a beatnik caricature who has an incestuous tryst with his sister. In &quot;Fred, the Teen-Age Girl Pigeon,&quot; Fritz is portrayed as a pop music star. The strips &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; and &quot;Fritz Bugs Out&quot; portray him as a hip poet and college dropout in the hippie scene. &quot;Fritz Bugs Out&quot; uses anthropomorphic characters to comment on race relations, with crows representing African Americans. Fritz is portrayed as a self-conscious hypocrite, obsessed with his racism and associated guilt, while crows are portrayed as &quot;hip innocents&quot;. &quot;Fritz the Cat, Secret Agent for the C.I.A.,&quot; inspired by the popularity of the James Bond series, portrays Fritz as a member of the Central Intelligence Agency. &quot;Fritz the No-Good&quot; depicts him becoming involved with terrorist revolutionaries; he also abuses and rapes one of the group members’ girlfriends.

Fritz has an on-again/off-again relationship with a female fox named Winston; they break up at the beginning of &quot;Fritz Bugs Out&quot;. Later in the story, she attempts to convince him not to &quot;bug out&quot;, but eventually agrees to go on a road trip with him. When her car overheats and stalls in the desert, Fritz abandons her. Winston is also a character featured in the 1972 film, as is this storyline—Fritz&#x27;s Volkswagen Beetle dodging big rig trucks on the highway in the middle of the night and later running out of gas in the middle of nowhere. She reappears in &quot;Fritz the Cat Doubts His Masculinity&quot; and in &quot;Fritz the No-Good&quot;, where they reunite after Fritz is thrown out of his wife&#x27;s apartment. Fuzzy the Bunny, who appeared in the early &quot;Animal Town&quot; strips, reappears as a college student in &quot;Fritz Bugs Out&quot; and as a revolutionary in &quot;Fritz the No-Good&quot;.

==Publication history==
&quot;Help!&quot;, a magazine published by former &quot;Mad&quot; editor Harvey Kurtzman, published two stories featuring Fritz, including the character&#x27;s first public appearance in January 1965, &quot;Fritz Comes on Strong&quot;. In this debut story, Fritz brings a young female cat home and strips all her clothes off before getting on top of her to pick fleas off of her. Preceding the publication of the story, Kurtzman sent Crumb a letter which read, &quot;Dear R. Crumb, we think the little pussycat drawings you sent us were just great. Question is, how do we print them without going to jail?&quot;

Although Kurtzman agreed to publish the story, he requested that Crumb alter the final two panels; the published version depicted Fritz standing next to her. Crumb later recalled that the original ending &quot;wasn&#x27;t that dirty ... only slightly risque by today&#x27;s standards&quot;. In May 1965, &quot;Help!&quot; published a second Fritz story, &quot;Fred, the Teen-Age Girl Pigeon&quot;. In this episode Fritz is a guitar-playing pop idol and he brings Fred, a female pigeon groupie, to his hotel room and proceeds to eat her. John Canaday&#x27;s &quot;New York&quot; magazine review of &quot;Head Comix&quot; describes this punch line as &quot;outrageous brilliance [that] is rivaled only by Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s last lines in &quot;The Loved One&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Fritz Bugs Out&quot; was serialized in &quot;Cavalier&quot; from February to October 1968. In the summer of 1968, &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; strips appeared in the Viking Press compilation titled &quot;Head Comix&quot;, which focused exclusively on Crumb&#x27;s material. In 1969, Ballantine Books paid Crumb a $5,000 advance for the publication rights to a compilation of three stories featuring Fritz. Crumb used the money to purchase a three-acre lot. In 2017, Crumb&#x27;s original cover art for the Ballantine collection sold at auction for $717,000, the highest sale price to that point for any piece of American cartoon art.

Crumb abandoned the character the same year as the Ballantine collection, but previously unpublished stories appeared in &quot;Promethean Enterprises&quot; No. 3 and 4 in 1971 and &quot;Artistic Comics&quot; (Golden Gate Publishing Company) in 1973. &quot;Fritz the Cat &#x27;Superstar&#x27;&quot; — featuring the death of the character — was the last new story released; it was published in &quot;The People&#x27;s Comics&quot; (Golden Gate) in 1972.

In 1978, Bélier Press published &quot;The Complete Fritz the Cat&quot;, which brought together all the published stories featuring Fritz, as well as previously unpublished drawings and unfinished comics. At the artist&#x27;s request, a 10-page story drawn in 1964 and previously published in &quot;R. Crumb&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; (Rip Off Press) in 1969 was excluded from this collection. In April 1993, Fantagraphics Books published &quot;The Life &amp; Death of Fritz the Cat&quot;, compiling nine major strips, including the 1964 story previously excluded from &quot;The Complete Fritz the Cat&quot;. &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; strips also appear in &quot;The Complete Crumb Comics&quot; series. An unpublished page featuring Fritz that had been intended for &quot;Help!&quot;, as well as comics featuring other characters related to the anthropomorphic universe of &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;, appeared in &quot;The R. Crumb Coffee Table Art Book&quot; in 1998.

==Cultural impact==
Following the publication of the compilations &quot;Head Comix&quot; and &quot;R. Crumb&#x27;s Fritz the Cat&quot;, Crumb received increased attention and &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; became one of the most familiar features on the underground comix scene and Crumb&#x27;s most famous creation. The strip&#x27;s association with the 1960s counterculture is so strong that for example the 1975 song &quot;Motorcycle Mama&quot;, being a nostalgic remembrance of the 1960s, by Swedish singer-songwriter Harpo mentions Fritz the Cat among other cultural icons of the decade such as &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, Jimi Hendrix, Ravi Shankar, &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, Woodstock, Bob Dylan, and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and according to Dez Skinn, author of &quot;Comix: The Underground Revolution&quot;, the strip served as an inspiration for &quot;Omaha the Cat Dancer&quot;.

Like many other of Crumb&#x27;s creations, Fritz the Cat has remained not without detractors. In &quot;Graphic Novels: A Bibliographic Guide to Book-Length Comics&quot;, D. Aviva Rothschild criticized the stories printed in the collection &quot;The Life &amp; Death of Fritz the Cat&quot; as being misogynist, racist, and violent. He felt that, &quot;They also tend to ramble, as if Crumb were making them up as he went along.&quot; Rothschild concluded that, &quot;Even though &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; is a classic, there are better, more coherent Crumb books around.&quot;

The stories served as the basis for a pair of film adaptations produced by Steve Krantz, &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; (1972), directed by Ralph Bakshi, and &quot;The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat&quot; (1974), directed by Robert Taylor. The first film adaptation of &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; was ranked 51st on the Online Film Critics Society&#x27;s list of the top 100 greatest animated films of all time and 56th on Channel 4&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Cartoons&quot;.

===Animated adaptations===
In 1969, New York animator Ralph Bakshi came across a copy of &quot;R. Crumb&#x27;s Fritz the Cat&quot; and suggested to producer Steve Krantz that it would work as a film. After meeting with Bakshi, Crumb loaned him one of his sketchbooks as a reference, but was unsure of the film&#x27;s production and refused to sign the contract. Bakshi and Crumb were unable to reach an agreement after two weeks of negotiations but Krantz secured the film rights from Crumb&#x27;s wife, Dana, who had a power of attorney. Crumb received $50,000, distributed over the course of production, and ten percent of Krantz&#x27;s proceeds.

&quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; was the first animated feature film to receive an X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The film&#x27;s distributor capitalized on the rating in the film&#x27;s advertising material, which touted the film as being &quot;X rated and animated!&quot; Released on 12 April 1972, it opened simultaneously in Hollywood and Washington, D.C. The film became a worldwide hit, grossing over $100 million (USD) and was the most successful independent animated feature ever. Crumb disliked how the film presented the sexual content and politics, denouncing Fritz&#x27;s dialogue in the final sequences of the film, which includes a paraphrased quote from The Beatles song &quot;The End&quot;, as &quot;red-neck and fascistic.&quot; Nonetheless, the film is credited with extending Crumb&#x27;s reputation beyond the underground comix scene.

Following the film&#x27;s release, Crumb quickly produced the story &quot;Fritz the Cat &#x27;Superstar&#x27;,&quot; in which he satirized Bakshi and Krantz. Crumb portrayed Fritz in a script conference for &quot;Fritz Goes to India&quot;, a fictional sequel to the film. Crumb&#x27;s story ends with a neurotic ex-girlfriend killing Fritz. She murders him by stabbing him in the back of the head with an ice pick due to Fritz&#x27;s overt sexism.

After the film&#x27;s release, the American humor magazine the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; published a comics story written by mordant humorist Michael O&#x27;Donoghue, and drawn by Randall Enos in a parody of Crumb&#x27;s style, called &quot;Fritz the Star in &#x27;Kitty Glitter.&#x27;&quot; The four-page piece portrayed the Fritz character as a jaded and complacent Hollywood star going through the motions of celebrities of the day: appearing on talk shows, commercials, and telethons mouthing vaguely liberal platitudes, before cynically guiding the conversation over to promoting his next movie. Other comics cats make appearances, including Felix the Cat, Krazy Kat, and underground comix cats Pat (from Jay Lynch&#x27;s Nard n&#x27; Pat) and Kim Deitch&#x27;s Waldo. The strip ends with a nightmarish full-page vista of &quot;Crumbland&quot;, where all of Crumb&#x27;s countercultural icons have been turned into commercial commodities.

In 1974, Krantz produced a sequel, &quot;The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat&quot;, without participation from either Bakshi or Crumb.

<text>Charles Krauthammer (; March 13, 1950 – June 21, 2018) was an American political columnist. A moderate liberal who turned independent conservative as a political pundit, Krauthammer won the Pulitzer Prize for his columns in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1987. His weekly column was syndicated to more than 400 publications worldwide. While in his first year studying medicine at Harvard Medical School, Krauthammer became permanently paralyzed from the waist down after a diving board accident that severed his spinal cord at cervical spinal nerve 5. After spending 14 months recovering in a hospital, he returned to medical school, graduating to become a psychiatrist involved in the creation of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III&quot; in 1980. He joined the Carter administration in 1978 as a director of psychiatric research, eventually becoming the speechwriter to Vice President Walter Mondale in 1980.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Krauthammer embarked on a career as a columnist and political commentator. In 1985, he began writing a weekly column for &quot;The Washington Post,&quot; which earned him the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for his &quot;witty and insightful columns on national issues&quot;. He was a weekly panelist on the PBS news program &quot;Inside Washington&quot; from 1990 until it ceased production in December 2013. Krauthammer had been a contributing editor to &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, a Fox News contributor, and a nightly panelist on &quot;Special Report with Bret Baier&quot; on Fox News.

Krauthammer received acclaim for his writing on foreign policy, among other matters. He was a leading conservative voice and proponent of United States military and political engagement on the global stage, coining the term &quot;Reagan Doctrine&quot; and advocating both the Gulf War and the Iraq War.

In August 2017, due to his battle with cancer, Krauthammer stopped writing his column and serving as a Fox News contributor. He died on June 21, 2018.

==Early life and career==
Krauthammer was born on March 13, 1950, in the New York City borough of Manhattan. His father, Shulim Krauthammer (November 23, 1904 – June 1987), was from Bolekhiv, Ukraine (then the Austro-Hungarian Empire), and later became a naturalized citizen of France. His mother, Thea (née Horowitz; July 28, 1921 – February 14, 2019), was from Antwerp, Belgium. The Krauthammer family was a French-speaking household. When he was 5, the Krauthammers moved to Montreal. Through the school year, they resided in Montreal and spent the summers in Long Beach, New York. Both of his parents were Orthodox Jews, and he graduated from Herzliah High School.

Krauthammer attended McGill University in Montreal, graduating in 1970 with first-class honours in economics and political science. At that time, McGill University was a hotbed of radical sentiment, something that Krauthammer said influenced his dislike of political extremism. &quot;I became very acutely aware of the dangers, the hypocrisies, and sort of the extremism of the political extremes. And it cleansed me very early in my political evolution of any romanticism.&quot; He later said: &quot;I detested the extreme Left and extreme Right, and found myself somewhere in the middle.&quot; The following year, after graduating from McGill, he studied as a Commonwealth Scholar in politics at Balliol College, Oxford, before returning to the United States to attend medical school at Harvard.

A diving accident during his first year of medical school left Krauthammer paralyzed from the waist down. He remained with his Harvard Medical School class during his hospitalization, graduating in 1975. He credited Hermann Lisco, associate dean of students, for making it happen.

From 1975 through 1978, Krauthammer was a resident in psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, serving as chief resident his final year. During his time as chief resident, he noted a variant of manic depression (bipolar disorder) that he identified and named &quot;secondary mania&quot;. He published his findings in the Archives of General Psychiatry. He also co-authored a path-finding study on the epidemiology of mania.

In 1978, Krauthammer relocated to Washington, D.C., to direct planning in psychiatric research under the Carter administration. He began contributing articles about politics to &quot;The New Republic&quot; and, in 1980, served as a speechwriter to Vice President Walter Mondale. He contributed to the third edition of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;. In 1984, he was board certified in psychiatry by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology.

==Career as columnist and political commentator==
In 1979, Krauthammer joined &quot;The New Republic&quot; as both a writer and editor. In 1983, he began writing essays for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, including one on the Reagan Doctrine, which first brought him national acclaim as a writer. Krauthammer began writing regular editorials for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1985 and became a nationally syndicated columnist. Krauthammer coined and developed the term &quot;Reagan Doctrine&quot; in 1985, and he defined the U.S. role as sole superpower in his essay &quot;The Unipolar Moment&quot;, published shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

In 1990, Krauthammer became a panelist for the weekly PBS political roundtable &quot;Inside Washington&quot;, remaining with the show until it ceased production in December 2013. Krauthammer also appeared on Fox News Channel as a contributor for many years.

Krauthammer&#x27;s 2004 speech &quot;Democratic Realism&quot;, which was delivered to the American Enterprise Institute when Krauthammer won the Irving Kristol Award, set out a framework for tackling the post-9/11 world, focusing on the promotion of democracy in the Middle East.

In 2013, Krauthammer published &quot;Things That Matter: Three Decades of Passions, Pastimes and Politics&quot;. An immediate bestseller, the book remained on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list for 38 weeks and spent 10 weeks in a row at number one.

His son Daniel is responsible for the final edits on a book that was posthumously released, &quot;The Point of It All: A Lifetime of Great Loves and Endeavors,&quot; that was published in December 2018.

==Personal life==
In 1974, Krauthammer married his wife, Robyn, a lawyer who stopped practicing law in order to focus on her work as an artist. They had one child, Daniel Krauthammer. Charles Krauthammer&#x27;s brother, Marcel, died in 2006.

Krauthammer was Jewish, raised largely in the Orthodox tradition, but in his adult life he variously described himself as &quot;not religious&quot; and &quot;a Jewish Shinto&quot; who engaged in &quot;ancestor worship&quot;. At the same time, while he considered himself a skeptic regarding religious fanaticism and those claiming to hold certainty of any particular theological dogma, he was also quite scornful of atheism, once being quoted as saying that of all the belief systems he was aware of, &quot;the only one I know is NOT true is atheism.&quot; His beliefs were sometimes described as a version of the &quot;ceremonial Deism&quot; exhibited by some of the U.S. Founding Fathers, particularly Thomas Jefferson. He was also influenced by his study of Maimonides at McGill University with Rabbi David Hartman, the head of Jerusalem&#x27;s Shalom Hartman Institute and professor of philosophy at McGill during Krauthammer&#x27;s student days.

Krauthammer was a member of both the Chess Journalists of America and the Council on Foreign Relations. He was co-founder of Pro Musica Hebraica, a not-for-profit organization devoted to presenting Jewish classical music, much of it lost or forgotten, in a concert hall setting.

Krauthammer was a big baseball fan. He enjoyed chess to a point that he gave it up later in life, fearing he was addicted.

In the final presidential election of his life, that of 2016, he openly refused to support either candidate and declared his intention to cast a write-in vote after giving extensive explanations for why he could support neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump.

== Death ==
In August 2017, Krauthammer had a cancerous tumor removed from his abdomen. The surgery was thought to have been successful; however, on June 8, 2018, Krauthammer announced that his cancer had returned and that doctors had given him only weeks to live. On June 21, he died of small intestine cancer in an Atlanta, Georgia hospital. He was 68. Krauthammer was survived by his wife and son. Mitch McConnell, Chris Wallace, David Nakamura, Megyn Kelly, John Roberts, Bret Baier, Mike Pence, and others paid tribute to him.

==Views and perspectives==

===Bioethics and medicine===
Krauthammer was a supporter of abortion legalization (although he believed &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was wrongly decided) and opposed to euthanasia.

Krauthammer was appointed to President George W. Bush&#x27;s Council on Bioethics in 2002. He supported relaxing the Bush administration&#x27;s limits on federal funding of discarded human embryonic stem cell research. Krauthammer supported embryonic stem cell research using embryos discarded by fertility clinics with restrictions in its applications. However, he opposed human cloning. He warned that scientists were beginning to develop the power of &quot;creating a class of superhumans&quot;. A fellow member of the council, Janet D. Rowley, insists that Krauthammer&#x27;s vision was still an issue far in the future and not a topic to be discussed at the present time.

In March 2009, Krauthammer was invited to the signing of an executive order by President Barack Obama at the White House but declined to attend because of his fears about the cloning of human embryos and the creation of normal human embryos solely for purposes of research. He also contrasted the &quot;moral seriousness&quot; of Bush&#x27;s stem cell address of August 9, 2001, with that of Obama&#x27;s address on stem cells.

Krauthammer was critical of the idea of living wills and the current state of end-of-life counseling and feared that Obamacare would just worsen the situation:

===Energy and global warming===
Krauthammer was a longtime advocate of radically higher energy taxes to induce conservation.

Krauthammer wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on February 20, 2014, &quot;I&#x27;m not a global warming believer. I&#x27;m not a global warming denier.&quot; Objecting to declaring global warming settled science, he contended that much that is believed to be settled turns out not to be so.

===Foreign policy===
Krauthammer first gained attention in 1985 when he first used the phrase &quot;Reagan Doctrine&quot; in his &quot;Time&quot; magazine column. The phrase was a reference to the American foreign policy of supporting anti-communist insurgencies around the globe (most notably Nicaragua, Angola, and Afghanistan) as a response to the Brezhnev Doctrine and reflected a U.S. foreign policy that went beyond containment of the Soviet Union to rollback of recent Soviet influence in the Third World. The policy, which was strongly supported by Heritage Foundation foreign policy analysts and other conservatives, was ultimately embraced by Reagan&#x27;s senior national security and foreign policy officials. Krauthammer&#x27;s description of it as the &quot;Reagan Doctrine&quot; has since endured.

In &quot;The Poverty of Realism&quot; (&quot;New Republic&quot;, February 17, 1986), he asserted:
The foreign policy, he argued, should be both &quot;universal in aspiration&quot; and &quot;prudent in application&quot;, thus combining American idealism and realism. Over the next 20 years these ideas developed into what is now called &quot;democratic realism&quot;.

In 1990, at the end the Cold War, Krauthammer wrote several articles entitled &quot;The Unipolar Moment&quot;. Krauthammer used the term &quot;unipolarity&quot; to describe the world structure that was emerging with the fall of the Soviet Union, with world power residing in the &quot;serenely dominant&quot; Western alliance led by the United States. Krauthammer predicted that the bipolar world of the Cold War would give way not to a multipolar world in which the U.S. was one of many centers of power, but a unipolar world dominated by the United States with a power gap between the most powerful state and the second most powerful state that would exceed any other in history. He also suggested that American hegemony would inevitably exist for only a historical &quot;moment&quot; lasting at most three or four decades.

Hegemony gave the United States the capacity and responsibility to act unilaterally if necessary, Krauthammer argued. Throughout the 1990s, however, he was circumspect about how that power ought to be used. He split from his neoconservative colleagues who were arguing for an interventionist policy of &quot;American greatness&quot;. Krauthammer wrote that in the absence of a global existential threat, the United States should stay out of &quot;teacup wars&quot; in failed states, and instead adopt a &quot;dry powder&quot; foreign policy of nonintervention and readiness. 
Krauthammer opposed purely &quot;humanitarian intervention&quot; (with the exception of overt genocide). While he supported the 1991 Gulf War on the grounds of both humanitarianism and strategic necessity (preventing Saddam Hussein from gaining control of the Persian Gulf and its resources), he opposed American intervention in the Yugoslav Wars on the grounds that America should not be committing the lives of its soldiers to purely humanitarian missions in which there is no American national interest at stake.

Krauthammer&#x27;s major 2004 monograph on foreign policy, &quot;Democratic Realism: An American Foreign Policy for a Unipolar World&quot;, was critical both of the neoconservative Bush doctrine for being too expansive and utopian, and of foreign policy &quot;realism&quot; for being too narrow and immoral; instead, he proposed an alternative he called &quot;Democratic Realism&quot;.

In a 2005 speech later published in &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine, Krauthammer called neoconservatism &quot;a governing ideology whose time has come.&quot; He noted that the original &quot;fathers of neoconservatism&quot; were &quot;former liberals or leftists&quot;. More recently, they have been joined by &quot;realists, newly mugged by reality&quot; such as Condoleezza Rice, Richard Cheney, and George W. Bush, who &quot;have given weight to neoconservatism, making it more diverse and, given the newcomers&#x27; past experience, more mature&quot;.

In a 2008 column entitled &quot;Charlie Gibson&#x27;s Gaffe&quot;, Krauthammer elaborated on the changing meanings of the Bush Doctrine in light of Gibson&#x27;s questioning of Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin regarding what exactly the Bush Doctrine was, which resulted in criticism of Palin&#x27;s response. Krauthammer states that the phrase originally referred to &quot;the unilateralism that characterized the pre-9/11 first year of the Bush administration,&quot; but elaborates, &quot;There is no single meaning of the Bush doctrine. In fact, there have been four distinct meanings, each one succeeding another over the eight years of this administration.&quot;

====Israel====
Krauthammer has been described as &quot;predictably tak[ing] Israel&#x27;s side and devot[ing] a significant amount of his... writing to defending steadfast U.S. support for Israel&quot;. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described his relationship with Krauthammer as &quot;like brothers&quot;.

Krauthammer strongly opposed the Oslo accords and said that Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasir Arafat would use the foothold it gave him in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to continue the war against Israel that he had ostensibly renounced in the Israel–Palestine Liberation Organization letters of recognition. In a July 2006 essay in &quot;Time&quot;, Krauthammer wrote that the Israeli–Palestinian conflict was fundamentally defined by the Palestinians&#x27; unwillingness to accept compromise.

During the 2006 Lebanon War, Krauthammer wrote a column, &quot;Let Israel Win the War&quot;: &quot;What other country, when attacked in an unprovoked aggression across a recognized international frontier, is then put on a countdown clock by the world, given a limited time window in which to fight back, regardless of whether it has restored its own security?&quot; He later criticized Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert&#x27;s conduct, arguing that Olmert &quot;has provided unsteady and uncertain leadership. Foolishly relying on air power alone, he denied his generals the ground offensive they wanted, only to reverse himself later.&quot;

Krauthammer supported a two-state solution to the conflict. Unlike many conservatives, he supported Israel&#x27;s Gaza withdrawal as a step toward rationalizing the frontiers between Israel and a future Palestinian state. He believed a security barrier between the two states&#x27; final borders will be an important element of any lasting peace.

When Richard Goldstone retracted the claim years after the issuance of the UN report on the 2008 Gaza war that Israel intentionally killed Palestinian civilians, including children, Krauthammer strongly criticized Goldstone, saying that &quot;this weasel-y excuse-laden retraction is too little and too late&quot; and called &quot;the original report a blood libel ranking with the libels of the 19th century in which Jews were accused of ritually slaughtering children in order to use the blood in rituals&quot;. Krauthammer thought that Goldstone &quot;should spend the rest of his life undoing the damage and changing and retracting that report&quot;.

====9/11, Iraq, and the War on Terror====
Krauthammer laid out the underlying principle of strategic necessity restraining democratic idealism in his controversial 2004 Kristol Award Lecture: &quot;We will support democracy everywhere, but we will commit blood and treasure only in places where there is a strategic necessity—meaning, places central to the larger war against the existential enemy, the enemy that poses a global mortal threat to freedom.&quot;

The 9/11 attacks, Krauthammer wrote, made clear the new existential threat and the necessity for a new interventionism. On September 12, 2001, he wrote that, if the suspicion that bin Laden was behind the attack proved correct, the United States had no choice but to go to war in Afghanistan. He supported the Second Iraq War on the &quot;realist&quot; grounds of the strategic threat the Saddam regime posed to the region as UN sanctions were eroding and of his alleged weapons of mass destruction and on the &quot;idealist&quot; grounds that a self-sustaining democracy in Iraq would be a first step toward changing the poisonous political culture of tyranny, intolerance, and religious fanaticism in the Arab world that had incubated the anti-American extremism from which 9/11 emerged.

In October 2002, he presented what he believed were the primary arguments for and against the war, writing, &quot;Hawks favor war on the grounds that Saddam Hussein is reckless, tyrannical, and instinctively aggressive, and that if he comes into possession of nuclear weapons in addition to the weapons of mass destruction he already has, he is likely to use them or share them with terrorists. The threat of mass death on a scale never before seen residing in the hands of an unstable madman is intolerable—and must be preempted. Doves oppose war on the grounds that the risks exceed the gains. War with Iraq could be very costly, possibly degenerating into urban warfare.&quot;

He continued: &quot;I happen to believe that the preemption school is correct, that the risks of allowing Saddam Hussein to acquire his weapons will only grow with time. Nonetheless, I can both understand and respect those few Democrats who make the principled argument against war with Iraq on the grounds of deterrence, believing that safety lies in reliance on a proven (if perilous) balance of terror rather than the risky innovation of forcible disarmament by preemption.&quot;

On the eve of the invasion, Krauthammer wrote, &quot;Reformation and reconstruction of an alien culture are a daunting task. Risky and, yes, arrogant.&quot; In February 2003, Krauthammer cautioned that &quot;it may yet fail. But we cannot afford not to try. There is not a single, remotely plausible, alternative strategy for attacking the monster behind 9/11. It&#x27;s not Osama bin Laden; it is the cauldron of political oppression, religious intolerance, and social ruin in the Arab-Islamic world—oppression transmuted and deflected by regimes with no legitimacy into virulent, murderous anti-Americanism.&quot; Krauthammer in 2003 wrote that the reconstruction of Iraq would provide many benefits for the Iraqi people, once the political and economic infrastructure destroyed by Saddam was restored: &quot;With its oil, its urbanized middle class, its educated population, its essential modernity, Iraq has a future. In two decades Saddam Hussein reduced its GDP by 75 percent. Once its political and industrial infrastructures are reestablished, Iraq&#x27;s potential for rebound, indeed for explosive growth, is unlimited.&quot;

On April 22, 2003, Krauthammer predicted that he would have a &quot;credibility problem&quot; if weapons of mass destruction were not found in Iraq within the next five months.

In a speech to the Foreign Policy Association in Philadelphia, he argued that the beginnings of democratization in the Arab world had been met in 2006 with a &quot;fierce counterattack&quot; by radical Islamist forces in Lebanon, Palestine, and especially Iraq, which witnessed a major intensification in sectarian warfare. In late 2006 and 2007, he was one of the few commentators to support the troop surge in Iraq.

In 2009, Krauthammer argued that the use of torture against enemy combatants was impermissible except in two contexts: (a) when &quot;[an] innocent&#x27;s life is at stake,&quot; &quot;[the] bad guy you have captured possesses information that could save this life, [and he] refuses to divulge&quot;; and (b) when torture may lead to &quot;the extraction of information from a high-value enemy in possession of high-value information likely to save lives&quot;.

===Ideology===
Meg Greenfield, editorial page editor for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; who edited Krauthammer&#x27;s columns for 15 years, called his weekly column &quot;independent and hard to peg politically. It&#x27;s a very tough column. There&#x27;s no &#x27;trendy&#x27; in it. You never know what is going to happen next.&quot; Hendrik Hertzberg, also a former colleague of Krauthammer while they worked at &quot;The New Republic&quot; in the 1980s, said that when the two first met in 1978, Krauthammer was &quot;70 percent Mondale liberal, 30 percent &#x27;Scoop Jackson Democrat&#x27;, that is, hard-line on Israel and relations with the Soviet Union&quot;; in the mid-1980s, he was still &quot;50–50: fairly liberal on economic and social questions but a full-bore foreign-policy neoconservative&quot;. Hertzberg in 2009 called Krauthammer a &quot;pretty solid 90–10 Republican&quot;. Krauthammer was described by some as having been a conservative.

===Presidential elections===
A few days before the 2012 United States presidential election, Krauthammer predicted it would be &quot;very close&quot; with Republican candidate Mitt Romney winning the &quot;popular [vote] by, I think, about half a point, Electoral College probably a very narrow margin&quot;. Although admitting his incorrect prediction, Krauthammer maintained, &quot;Obama won but had no mandate. He won by going very small, very negative.&quot;

Before the 2016 United States presidential election, Krauthammer stated that &quot;I will not vote for Hillary Clinton, but, as I&#x27;ve explained in my columns, I could never vote for Donald Trump&quot;.

In July 2017 following the release by Donald Trump Jr. of the email chain about the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016, Krauthammer opined that even bungled collusion is still collusion.

===Religion===
Krauthammer received a rigorous Jewish education. He attended a school where half the day was devoted to secular studies and half the day was devoted to religious education conducted in Hebrew. By the time he graduated from high school at the age of 16, Krauthammer was able to write philosophical essays in Hebrew. His father demanded that he learn Talmud; in addition to his school&#x27;s required Talmud studies, Krauthammer took extra Talmud classes three days a week. This was not enough for his father who hired a rabbi to provide private instruction on the Talmud three nights a week.

Krauthammer&#x27;s attachment to Judaism was strengthened through his study of Maimonides at McGill University under Rabbi David Hartman. Krauthammer said, &quot;I had discovered the world, and was going to leave all of this [Judaism] behind, because I was too sophisticated for it. And then in my third year I took Hartman&#x27;s course in Maimonides, and I&#x27;m thinking this is pretty serious stuff. It stands up to the Greeks, stands up to the philosophers of the age, and it gave me sort of a renewed commitment to and respect for my own tradition, which I already knew, but was ready to throw away. And I didn&#x27;t throw it away as a result of that encounter.&quot;

Krauthammer stated that &quot;atheism is the least plausible of all theologies. I mean, there are a lot of wild ones out there, but the one that clearly runs so contrary to what is possible, is atheism&quot;.

Krauthammer opposed the Park51 project in Manhattan for &quot;reasons of common decency and respect for the sacred. No commercial tower over Gettysburg, no convent at Auschwitz, and no mosque at Ground Zero. Build it anywhere but there.&quot;

Krauthammer was critical of intelligent design, &quot;a self-enclosed, tautological &#x27;theory&#x27; whose only holding is that when there are gaps in some area of scientific knowledge — in this case, evolution — they are to be filled by God. It is a &#x27;theory&#x27; that admits that evolution and natural selection explain such things as the development of drug resistance in bacteria and other such evolutionary changes within species, but that every once in a while God steps into this world of constant and accumulating change and says, &#x27;I think I&#x27;ll make me a lemur today.&#x27; A &#x27;theory&#x27; that violates the most basic requirement of anything pretending to be science — that it be empirically disprovable.&quot; Of &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot;, he wrote: &quot;Dover distinguished itself this Election Day by throwing out all eight members of its school board who tried to impose &#x27;intelligent design&#x27; — today&#x27;s tarted-up version of creationism — on the biology curriculum.&quot; Of the Kansas evolution hearings, he wrote: &quot;In order to justify the farce that intelligent design is science, Kansas had to corrupt the very definition of science, dropping the phrase &#x27;natural explanations for what we observe in the world around us,&#x27; thus unmistakably implying — by fiat of definition, no less — that the supernatural is an integral part of science. This is an insult both to religion and to science.&quot; He concluded: How ridiculous to make evolution the enemy of God. What could be more elegant, more simple, more brilliant, more economical, more creative, indeed more divine than a planet with millions of life forms, distinct and yet interactive, all ultimately derived from accumulated variations in a single double-stranded molecule, pliable and fecund enough to give us mollusks and mice, Newton and Einstein? Even if it did give us the Kansas State Board of Education, too. He noted the scientific consensus on evolution, arguing that the religion–science controversy was a &quot;false conflict&quot;.

===Supreme Court nominations===
Krauthammer criticized President George W. Bush&#x27;s 2005 nomination of Harriet Miers to succeed Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor. He called the nomination of Miers a &quot;mistake&quot; on several occasions. He noted her lack of constitutional experience as the main obstacle to her nomination.

On October 21, 2005, Krauthammer published &quot;Miers: The Only Exit Strategy&quot;, in which he explained that all of Miers&#x27;s relevant constitutional writings are protected by both attorney–client privilege and executive privilege, which presented a unique face-saving solution to the mistake: &quot;Miers withdraws out of respect for both the Senate and the executive&#x27;s prerogatives.&quot; Six days later, Miers withdrew, employing that argument:

The same day, NPR noted, &quot;Krauthammer&#x27;s scenario played out almost exactly as he wrote.&quot; Columnist E. J. Dionne wrote that the White House was following Krauthammer&#x27;s strategy &quot;almost to the letter&quot;. A few weeks later, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Krauthammer&#x27;s &quot;exit strategy&quot; was &quot;exactly what happened&quot; and that Krauthammer &quot;had no prior inkling from the administration that they were taking that route; he was later given credit for giving the Bush administration a plan.&quot;

===Other issues===
Krauthammer was an opponent of capital punishment, writing: &quot;there is no convincing evidence that the death penalty deters. Murder rates in states with the death penalty are just as high as in neighboring states without it. In states where the death penalty has been introduced, murder rates do not, on average, go down. And in states where the death penalty has been abolished, murder rates do not go up. When something as barbaric as cold-blooded execution by the state makes no appreciable contribution to public safety, it deserves abolition.&quot;

In 2017, Krauthammer argued in favor of a border wall at the Mexico–United States border.

==Awards and accolades==
Krauthammer&#x27;s &quot;New Republic&quot; essays won him the &quot;National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism&quot;. The weekly column he began writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1985 won him the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1987. On June 14, 1993, he was awarded the Honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from McGill University.

In 1999, Krauthammer received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. His acceptance speech at the 1999 Summit in Washington, D.C., is included in his book, &quot;The Point of It All: A Lifetime of Great Loves and Endeavors,&quot; published after his death.

In 2006, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; named Krauthammer the most influential commentator in America, stating that &quot;Krauthammer has influenced US foreign policy for more than two decades.&quot;

In 2009, &quot;Politico&quot; columnist Ben Smith wrote that Krauthammer had &quot;emerged in the Age of Obama as a central conservative voice, the kind of leader of the opposition that economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman represented for the left during the Bush years: a coherent, sophisticated and implacable critic of the new president.&quot; In 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist David Brooks said Krauthammer was &quot;the most important conservative columnist.&quot; In 2011, former congressman and MSNBC host Joe Scarborough called him &quot;without a doubt the most powerful force in American conservatism. He has [been] for two, three, four years.&quot;

In a December 2010, press conference, former president Bill Clinton – a Democrat – called Krauthammer &quot;a brilliant man&quot;. Krauthammer responded, tongue-in-cheek, that &quot;my career is done&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m toast.&quot; Krauthammer also received the William F. Buckley Award for Media Excellence in 2013.

Krauthammer&#x27;s other awards included the People for the American Way&#x27;s First Amendment Award, the Champion Media Award for Economic Understanding from Amos Tuck School of Business Administration, the first annual Bradley Prize, the 2002 &quot;Mightier Pen&quot; award from the Center for Security Policy, the 2004 Irving Kristol Award, and the 2009 Eric Breindel Award for Excellence in Opinion Journalism, an annual award given by the Eric Breindel Foundation.
