<text>A designated marksman (DM), squad advanced marksman (AD) or squad designated marksman (SDM) is a military marksman role in an infantry squad. The term &quot;sniper&quot; was used in Soviet doctrine although the soldiers using the Dragunov SVD were the first to use a specifically designed designated marksman rifle.

The DM&#x27;s role is to supplement the attached squad by providing accurate fire upon enemy targets at distances up to . Due to the need for repeated effective fire, the DM is usually equipped with a scoped semi-automatic rifle called a designated marksman rifle (DMR). Like snipers, DMs are trained in scouting and precise shooting, but unlike the more specialized &quot;true&quot; sniper (who often operate independently), they operate as an intrinsic part of an infantry fireteam and are tasked to lay down accurate support fire at valuable targets as per tactical necessity, thus extending the reach of the fireteam.

The growth of the DM rifle can be attributed to two main influences; the near-universal adoption of intermediate cartridges, such as 5.56×45mm, 5.45×39mm, and 7.62×39mm for standard service rifles, which limit the typical effective range of a standard infantryman to within ; and the increasing specialization over the last 15 years (mid-2000s to late 2010s) of Western sniper rifles and their employment of more powerful rounds, such as .300 Winchester Magnum and .338 Lapua Magnum, which are more suitable for targets beyond . These two influences have left a gap in the firepower of the rifle platoon that a more accurate optic-equipped service rifle derivative can usefully fulfill, especially in theaters such as Afghanistan where the shortcomings of standard 5.56mm service rifles at ranges over 300 meters became apparent.

== DM/sniper differences ==

The DM role differs significantly from that of a specially trained sniper. A sniper is a specialist highly trained in fieldcraft, who carries out a range of ISTAR-specific missions independent of others, and more specialized than standard infantry tasks. In contrast, a DM is a soldier who has received additional marksmanship training. Within a fireteam, the DM&#x27;s role is to provide an additional capability to the infantry platoon, which is the ability to engage targets at greater ranges than the other members of the squad or section.

The DM operates as an integral member of the infantry platoon, providing a niche capability contributing to the overall firepower of the platoon in the same way as a grenadier with a rifle-mounted grenade launcher, allowing the team to engage more numerous targets and vehicles; or the automatic rifleman who employs the squad/section machine gun to lay down suppressing fire for area denial to the enemy. The DM weapon provides a capability to the infantry platoon in the shape of increased precision at a greater range than that provided by the standard infantry rifle, by virtue of its sighting system and/or larger caliber. By comparison, the sniper role is much more specialized, with very comprehensive selection, training and equipment.

Snipers are ordinarily equipped with specialized, purpose-built bolt-action or semi-automatic sniper rifles or anti-materiel rifles; while DMs are often equipped with accurized battle rifles or assault rifles fitted with optical sights and heavy barrels.

Snipers are mainly employed for targets at ranges from up to more than . In the UK, US, and other Western countries over the last 15 years, sniper rifles chambered for standard military calibers, such as 7.62×51mm, have been replaced with those that employ larger, more specialized rounds, such as .300 Winchester Magnum or .338 Lapua Magnum, which give better accuracy at longer ranges than the standard military rifle calibers. An example of this is the British Army&#x27;s replacement of the Accuracy International L96A1 in 7.62×51mm with the similar but larger and more powerful Accuracy International L115A3 rifle chambered in .338 Lapua Magnum.

DMs are utilized for targets at ranges between approximately using a rifle chambered with standard-issue rifle ammunition, usually either 5.56×45mm or 7.62×51mm. While snipers often take a fixed strategic position and camouflage themselves (e.g. with a Ghillie suit), a DM will tactically move with his unit and is otherwise equipped in the same way as other members of the infantry platoon.

== Equipment ==

=== Rifles ===
The designated marksman is intended to fill the gap between the typical infantry rifle and longer-range sniper rifles. The typical service rifle is intended for use at ranges up to a maximum of 300 meters, while sniper rifles are generally optimized for ranges of 600 meters and greater. Designated marksman rifles are designed to fill this gap, typically being employed at ranges of .

In some cases, the designated marksman rifle is simply an accurized version of the standard service rifle, such as the Mk 12 SPR (which is built on an M16 platform), while in other cases the rifle is a larger caliber rifle design, such as the British L129A1, Soviet SVD, or US rifles based on the M14, AR-10, or HK417.

Whether a modified existing service rifle or a specific design, the DM rifle will be chambered for a round already used in the infantry battalion, such as 5.56×45mm or 7.62×51mm, and it will retain semi-automatic firing capability with a magazine capacity of 10, 20, or 30 rounds, depending on the firearm in question.

=== Sidearm ===
Designated marksmen will carry whichever service pistol is specified in their unit&#x27;s TOE for their billet or Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), if one is specified or available at all.

== Worldwide use ==
===Australian Army===
A typical Australian Army fireteam of four soldiers will include a scout employing an F88S Austeyr (5.56 NATO) fitted with an enhanced optic device, usually either an ACOG or ELCAN C79. Additionally, 7.62 mm marksman rifles (SR-25s) are employed by the maneuver support teams in the platoon. However, HK417 rifles have been procured by the Army as a substitute for the F88S during operations in Afghanistan and possibly thereafter. The SASR also uses the Mk 14 EBR amongst its four-man infantry sections.

=== British Army ===
Recently, the L86A2 Light Support Weapon was used in the designated marksman role due to its longer barrel compared to the standard L85A2 service rifle, which gives an increased range of up to 1000 m (1094 yd) while also capable of giving accurate automatic fire; the automatic fire role is now usually delivered by the Minimi. The Parachute Regiment, Royal Marines and United Kingdom Special Forces also use the HK417 rifle in the designated marksman role.

On 28 December 2009, the UK Ministry of Defence announced the adoption of the L129A1 Sharpshooter rifle made by Lewis Machine and Tool Company of the US for use as a semi-automatic DM rifle, firing the 7.62×51mm NATO round, providing accurate fire of up to 1000m as an urgent operational requirement (UOR) in Afghanistan.

=== Indian Army ===
The Indian Army uses a locally manufactured licensed variant of the SVD Dragunov in the Designated Marksman role. The Dragunov is used in conjunction with the INSAS family of weapons to give flexibility and striking power, in short to mid range firefights, to Indian Army infantry units engaged with opposing forces.

=== Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ===
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) implemented significant changes to sharpshooting doctrine in the 1990s. Doctrine, training program, and courseware were completely rewritten and snipers were issued the bolt-action M24 SWS instead of the M14 rifle. A major change was the introduction of a new battle profession – the &quot;designated marksman&quot; (קלע סער, &quot;kala sa&#x27;ar&quot; in Hebrew) – intended to improve the accuracy and firepower of an infantry platoon and compromise between the role of a sniper and an assault rifleman. These soldiers were generally called &quot;squad snipers&quot; to describe their role. They are armed with SR-25 rifle and sharpshooter variations of the IMI Tavor TAR-21 (STAR-21), M16A2E3 and M4 carbine.

===United States Armed Forces===
==== United States Marine Corps ====
The U.S. Marines use M14s that have been rebuilt at Marine Corps Base Quantico and designated as Designated Marksman Rifles, which are being replaced by the M39 Enhanced Marksman Rifle. The Corps also utilizes two different adaptations of the M16 assault rifle: the Squad Advanced Marksman Rifle (SAM-R), and the Mk 12 Mod 1 SPR. They also utilize the M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle.

==== United States Army ====
The United States Army 101st Airborne Division recognized the need for a Squad Designated Marksman when they encountered fires beyond the 300-600m range. In 2004, they began issuing M14s to specially trained soldiers for Designated Marksman work. The 82nd Airborne Division deployed with designated marksmen, trained on the M-4 using ACOGs with great success out to 600m, some 82nd Airborne units were issued M14s. The 3rd Infantry Division saw limited use of a modified M16, which was accurized in a manner similar to the U.S. Marines SAM-R, unofficially designated the AMU Squad Designated Marksman Rifle (SDM-R). This rifle was designed for engagements up to 1000m.

The U.S. Army DM also uses the predecessor of the M16 rifle, the M14, in certain infantry line units. These are commonly equipped with Leupold optics, a Sage stock and are designated the M14SE Crazy Horse.

==== United States Navy ====
The United States Navy SEAL Teams employs SDM rifles in roughly the same manner as the Marine Corps and Army, although there is no specific &quot;Designated Marksman&quot; role in a SEAL platoon. Known used weapons include, but are not limited to, the Mk 14 Mod 0 Enhanced Battle Rifle, M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System, MK11/SR-25, the MK12 Mod X, the &quot;SEAL Recon Rifle&quot; and in some cases even regular M14 Rifles fitted with optical scopes. 

The United States Navy Naval Expeditionary Combat Command employ Expeditionary Designated Marksman to support COCOM / DOD tasking as required. Known used weapons are the Mk 14 Mod 0 Enhanced Battle Rifle or M4 Rifle with fitted optical scopes. Previously, Designated Marksman assigned to NECC&#x27;s Helicopter, Visit, Search, and Seizure teams were equipped with the M21 (SWS) w/ Leupold Mk4 LR/T after training with the USMC, US Army, and training organizations to deploy the rifle from various platforms (helicopter, ship, ground).

=== Soviet snipers ===

Although referred to as &quot;snipers&quot;, the Soviet Union and its allies have since World War II employed specially-equipped and trained &quot;sharpshooting&quot; soldiers at a section (&quot;squad&quot;) and platoon level to increase the range of their section to . This is commonly accepted as the first example of what came to be known as a &quot;designated marksman&quot; as opposed to a true sniper.

Since 1963, these soldiers have been equipped with the Dragunov SVD rifle that shares all the characteristics typical of a designated marksman rifle (Semi-automatic fire, telescopic sight, chambered for standard military rifle cartridge).

<text>Need for Speed (NFS) is a racing game franchise published by Electronic Arts and currently developed by Criterion Games (the developers of the &quot;Burnout&quot; series). Most entries in the series are generally arcade racing games centered around illegal street racing, and tasks players to complete various types of races, while evading the local law enforcement in police pursuits. Some entries also do not follow the basic setup of most titles and are instead simulation racers, focus on legal circuit races, feature kart racing game elements, or feature illegal street racing but not feature police pursuits. &quot;Need for Speed&quot; is one of EA&#x27;s oldest franchises not published under their EA Sports brand. 

The series&#x27; first title, &quot;The Need for Speed&quot;, was released in 1994. The latest installment, &quot;Need for Speed Unbound&quot;, was released on December 2, 2022. Additionally, a free-to-play mobile installment released in 2015, &quot;Need for Speed: No Limits&quot;, is actively developed by Firemonkeys Studios (the developers of &quot;Real Racing 3&quot;).

The series titles have been overseen and developed by multiple notable teams over the years, including EA Canada, EA Black Box, Slightly Mad Studios, and Ghost Games. Several &quot;Need for Speed&quot; games have been well-received critically, and the franchise has been one of the most successful of all time, selling over 150 million copies as of October 2013. The franchise has expanded into other forms of media, including a film adaptation and licensed Hot Wheels toys.

==History==
The &quot;Need for Speed&quot; series was originally developed by Distinctive Software, a video game studio based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Prior to Electronic Arts&#x27; purchase of the company in 1991, it had created popular racing games such as &quot;Stunts&quot; and &quot;Test Drive II: The Duel&quot;. After the purchase, the company was renamed Electronic Arts (EA) Canada. The company capitalized on its experience in the domain by developing the &quot;Need for Speed&quot; series in late 1992. EA Canada continued to develop and expand the &quot;Need for Speed&quot; franchise up to 2002, when another Vancouver-based developer, named Black Box Games, was acquired by EA and contracted to continue the series with &quot;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2&quot;. Meanwhile, Slightly Mad Studios would develop the 2009 sim racing title, &quot;Need for Speed: Shift&quot;, and its 2011 sequel, &quot;Shift 2: Unleashed&quot;. 

The UK-based Criterion Games would develop the 2010 &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot; title; a successor to 1998&#x27;s &quot;Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit&quot;. The game introduced a social platform, titled Autolog, which allows players to track game progress, view leaderboards, share screenshots with friends, among other features. The 2010 &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot; game would be well-received; a remastered version was released ten years later in 2020. As a result of &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot;″s critical success, in-contrast to the mixed reception of the Black Box-developed installments since 2007&#x27;s &quot;Need for Speed: ProStreet&quot;, Criterion would become the lead developer of the franchise going forward. At E3 2012, Criterion Games vice president Alex Ward announced that random developers would no longer be developing &quot;NFS&quot; titles. Ward wouldn&#x27;t confirm that all &quot;Need for Speed&quot; games in the future would be developed entirely by Criterion, but he did say the studio would have &quot;strong involvement&quot; in them and would have control over which &quot;NFS&quot; titles would be released in the future. 

In August 2013, following the downsizing of Criterion Games, EA Swedish developer Ghost Games would become the main studio for the franchise, and oversee its future development. At the time, 80% of Ghost Games&#x27; work force consisted of former Criterion Games employees. From 2013 to 2019, Ghost Games would develop &quot;Need for Speed Rivals&quot;, the 2015 franchise reboot, 2017&#x27;s &quot;Need for Speed Payback&quot;, and 2019&#x27;s &quot;Need for Speed Heat&quot;. While &quot;Rivals&quot; was positively-received, the 2015 reboot and its follow-ups received more mixed reviews.

In February 2020, Criterion regained oversight of the franchise, with its first release since then being 2022&#x27;s &quot;Need for Speed Unbound&quot;. Meanwhile, several past entries (namely &quot;Need for Speed: Carbon&quot;, &quot;Need for Speed: Undercover&quot;, &quot;Shift&quot;, &quot;Shift 2&quot; and &quot;Need for Speed: The Run&quot;), with the exception of 2010&#x27;s &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot;, and 2012&#x27;s &quot;Need for Speed: Most Wanted&quot;, became delisted from online stores. Their respective online servers were shut down on August 31, 2021.

==Gameplay==
Almost all of the games in the &quot;NFS&quot; series employ the same fundamental rules and similar mechanics: the player controls a race car in a variety of races, the goal being to win the race. In the tournament/career mode, the player must win a series of races in order to unlock vehicles and tracks. Before each race, the player chooses a vehicle and has the option of selecting either an automatic or manual transmission. All games in the series have some form of multiplayer mode allowing players to race one another via a split screen, a LAN or the Internet. Since &quot;Need for Speed: High Stakes&quot;, the series has also integrated car body customization into gameplay.

Although the games share the same name, their tone and focus can vary significantly. For example, in some games the cars can suffer mechanical and visual damage, while in other games the cars cannot be damaged at all; in some games, the software simulates real-car behavior (physics), while in others there are more forgiving physics.

With the release of &quot;Need for Speed: Underground&quot;, the series shifted from racing sports cars on scenic point-to-point tracks to an import/tuner subculture involving street racing in an urban setting. To date, this theme has remained prevalent in most of the following games.

&quot;Need for Speed: Shift&quot; and its sequel took a simulator approach to racing, featuring closed-circuit racing on real tracks like the Nürburgring and Laguna Seca, as well as the fictional street circuits in various cities like London and Chicago. The car lists include a combination of exotics, sports cars, and tuners in addition to special race cars.

Most of the games in the franchise include police pursuits in some form or other. In some of the games featuring police pursuit (e.g. &quot;Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit&quot;), the player can play as either the felon or the cop. The concepts of drifting and dragging were introduced in &quot;Need for Speed: Underground&quot;. These new mechanics are included in the tournament/career mode aside from the regular street races. In drift races, in games like &quot;Underground&quot; and &quot;Need for Speed (2015)&quot;, the player must defeat other racers by totaling the most points, earned by the length and timing of the drift made by the player&#x27;s vehicle. In drag races, the player must finish first to win the race, though if the player crashes into an obstacle or wall, the race ends. In &quot;Need for Speed Payback&quot;, the player has to earn a certain number of points to win; increase their multiplier based on how many points they get, whilst passing through a limited number of checkpoints.

The concept of car tuning evolved with each new game, from focusing mainly on the mechanics of the car to including how the car looks. Each game except &quot;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit&quot; has car tuning which can set options for items like ABS, traction control, or downforce, or for upgrading parts like the engine or gearbox. Visual tuning of the player&#x27;s car becomes important in tournament/career mode after the release of &quot;Need for Speed: Underground 2&quot;, when the appearance is rated from zero to ten points. When a car attains a high enough visual rating, the vehicle is eligible to be on the cover of a fictional magazine.

Like all racing games, the &quot;Need for Speed&quot; series features a list of cars, modeled and named after actual cars. Cars in the franchise are divided into four categories: exotic cars, muscle cars, tuners, and special vehicles. Exotic cars feature high performance, expensive cars like the Lamborghini Murciélago, Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, Chevrolet Corvette and the Ford GT; muscle cars refer to the Ford Mustang, Dodge Challenger and the Chevrolet Camaro; while tuner cars are cars like the Nissan Skyline and the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. The special vehicles are civilian and police cars that are available for use in some games, such as the Ford Crown Victoria in &quot;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit&quot; and garbage trucks, fire engines and taxis in &quot;Need for Speed: Carbon&quot;.

Originally the series took place in international settings, such as race tracks in Australia, Europe, and Africa. Beginning with &quot;Underground&quot;, the series has taken place in fictional metropolitan cities. The first game featured traffic on &quot;head to head&quot; mode, while later games traffic can be toggled on and off, and starting with &quot;Underground&quot;, traffic is a fixed obstacle. Most of the recent &quot;Need for Speed&quot; games are set in fictional locations of our world, in a number of different time periods. These include, but are not limited to, Olympic, Bayview, Rockport, Palmont City, Tri-City Bay, Seacrest County, Fairhaven City, Redview County, Ventura Bay, Fortune Valley, Palm City and Lakeshore City.

==Games==


===Primary installments===
====&quot;The Need for Speed&quot; (1994)====

The original &quot;Need for Speed&quot; was released for 3DO in 1994 with versions released for the PC (DOS) (1995), PlayStation and Saturn (1996) following shortly afterwards. &quot;The Need for Speed&quot; and its &quot;Special Edition&quot; were the only games in the series to support DOS, with subsequent releases for the PC running only on Windows (excluding &quot;Need for Speed: Carbon&quot; which was also released on Mac OS X).

The first installment of &quot;The Need for Speed&quot; was the only serious attempt by the series to provide a realistic simulation of car handling elements through the direct collaboration of Staff members from &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot;. Electronic Arts left the handling dynamics tuning with the automotive magazine&#x27;s seasoned drivers to match vehicle behavior including realistic over and understeer that remains impressive decades later, as well as sounds made by the vehicles&#x27; gear control levers and other functions. The game contained vehicle data with spoken commentary, several &quot;magazine-style&quot; images of each car, and short video clips highlighting the vehicles set to music. Most cars and tracks are available at the beginning of the game, and the objective is to unlock the remaining locked content by winning tournaments. This version featured chases by police cars, a popular theme throughout the series.

Another version called &quot;The Need for Speed: Special Edition&quot;, was released only for the PC in 1996. It featured support for DirectX 2 and TCP/IP networking, two new tracks, but dropped the ever-popular flip and go in favor of the more generic scene reset after an accident, a portents of the arcade-style gaming that would dominate the series ever after.

====&quot;Need for Speed II&quot; (1997)====

&quot;Need for Speed II&quot; (&quot;NFS II&quot;) featured some rare and exotic vehicles, including the Ford Indigo concept vehicle, and featured country-themed tracks from North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. A new racing mode was also introduced, dubbed &quot;Knockout&quot;, where the last racers to finish laps will be eliminated. In addition, track design was more open-ended; players could now &quot;drive&quot; off the asphalt, and cut across fields to take advantage of shortcuts. &quot;Need for Speed II: Special Edition&quot; includes one extra track, extra cars, and support for Glide. The PlayStation port of &quot;NFS II&quot; also took advantage of the NeGcon controller, and the Dual Analog and DualShock controllers as well.

====&quot;Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit&quot; (1998)====

&quot;Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit&quot; added &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot; mode, where the player either attempted to outrun the police or be the cop, arresting speeders. &quot;NFS III&quot; took advantage of the multimedia capabilities by featuring audio commentary, picture slideshows, and music videos. This game was the first in the series to allow the downloading of additional cars from the official website. As a result, modding communities sprang up to create vehicles. The PC version was also the first game in the series to support Direct3D hardware.

====&quot;Need for Speed: High Stakes&quot; (1999)====

&quot;High Stakes&quot;, developed by EA Canada and EA Seattle, was released in 1999. The game features more realistic elements than its predecessors and introduced a damage system that allows cars to take damage when colliding with objects, affecting their appearance and performance. It also introduced a series of economy-based tournaments, awarding players with a cash prize that can be spent on repairing, purchasing, or upgrading cars for subsequent races. The game&#x27;s Hot Pursuit mode, which was introduced in &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot;, was expanded with more options, allowing players to control police pursuits attempting to stop racers.

====&quot;Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed&quot; (2000)====

&quot;Porsche Unleashed&quot; (North America and Latin America title), &quot;Porsche 2000&quot; (European and Australian title), or simply &quot;Porsche&quot; (in Germany) is different from the previous versions because it featured only Porsches.

The vehicle handling in the PC version was said to be the most realistic in any &quot;NFS&quot; game, but the PSX (PS1) version had very simplified arcade handling that fell woefully short of the hallmark handling offered in the first game. The player had to win races to unlock cars in chronological order from 1950 to 2000. &quot;Porsche Unleashed&quot; also featured a Factory Driver mode, where the player had to test Porsches to move forward in the game and did not feature a split-screen mode.

====&quot;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2&quot; (2002)====

&quot;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2&quot; was the debut NFS title from EA Black Box, and the first &quot;NFS&quot; for the sixth generation consoles. Different versions of the game were produced for each platform. The Xbox, GameCube, and Microsoft Windows versions were developed by EA Seattle, while the PS2 version was developed by Black Box Games in Vancouver.

&quot;Hot Pursuit 2&quot; draws primarily from the gameplay and style of &quot;NFS III&quot;, putting emphasis on evading the police and over-the-top tracks. Although the game allowed players to play as the police, the pursuit mode was less realistic than preceding versions of &quot;NFS&quot;; players merely needed to &quot;tap&quot; a speeder to arrest them, as opposed to using simulated police tactics to immobilize a speeding vehicle. This was the first version since the start of the series not to feature an &quot;in the driving seat&quot; (cockpit) camera view, transitioning EA from realistic racing to arcade street racing. It was the last game in the series for the PC version to feature the split-screen two-player mode introduced in &quot;Need for Speed II&quot;. For the multiplayer mode of the PC version, GameSpy&#x27;s internet matchmaking system was used in place of Local Area Network (LAN) play. &quot;Hot Pursuit 2&quot; was the first &quot;NFS&quot; game to use songs sung by licensed artists under the EA Trax label.

====&quot;Need for Speed: Underground&quot; (2003)====

&quot;Need for Speed: Underground&quot; was developed by EA Black Box and released in 2003. On PC, this was the first &quot;NFS&quot; game to require Hardware Transform and Lighting in graphics cards. Most of the new elements in &quot;Underground&quot; became defining marks of later installments in the &quot;Need for Speed&quot; series.

&quot;Underground&quot; shifted from semi-professional racing and isolated circuits to the street racing style of other arcade racing series: all circuits became part of a single map, Olympic City, except for drifts. &quot;Underground&quot; introduced two new play modes (Drag and Drift) and more tuning options than in the earlier &quot;High Stakes&quot;. &quot;Underground&quot; was also the first game in the series to feature a story, told via pre-rendered videos. &quot;Underground&quot; features tuner cars and has a wide variety of tuning options such as widebody kits, bumpers, spoilers, as well as performance upgrades such as engines and nitrous. City street racing is the primary focus of the game. There are no police in &quot;Underground&quot; and &quot;Underground 2&quot;, which drew criticism as police had been an important part of previous titles.

====&quot;Need for Speed: Underground 2&quot; (2004)====

&quot;Need for Speed: Underground 2&quot;, was developed by EA Black Box and released in 2004. A demo of the game was placed as a bonus in copies of the EA/Criterion collaboration &quot;Burnout 3: Takedown&quot;.

In &quot;Underground 2&quot;, the story mode continued, but there were new racing modes such as Underground Racing League and Street X, more tuning options, and a new method of selecting races. Also included was an &quot;outrun&quot; mode where a player can challenge random opponents on the road (similar to &quot;Tokyo Xtreme Racer&quot;). &quot;Underground 2&quot; also introduced several SUVs, used to race against other SUVs. The most significant change vs. the original &quot;Underground&quot; was the introduction of its open world (free roam) environments, setting the tone for numerous NFS games to come. This was also the publisher&#x27;s most marketed feature at launch. In addition, the game featured actresses/models Brooke Burke and Kelly Brook as in-game characters to help guide the player through the campaign.

The customization features were significantly expanded on modifications that did not affect vehicle performance. Players were required to customize their car to a certain numerical value in order to be offered DVD and magazine covers, the only way to advance to higher game levels. The game featured more extensive product placement for companies with no connection to auto racing. This game also had extensive customization options in the form of suspension upgrades, nitrous systems, and engine mods.

&quot;Need for Speed: Underground Rivals&quot; was the first &quot;Need for Speed&quot; game released on the PlayStation Portable. Different from &quot;Need for Speed: Underground 2&quot; as it had no free roam and the cars were very limited, it was released in 2005.

====&quot;Need for Speed: Most Wanted&quot; (2005)====

&quot;Need for Speed: Most Wanted&quot; was developed by EA Black Box, released in 2005, and was one of the first games released for the Xbox 360. The PlayStation Portable port of &quot;Most Wanted&quot; is titled &quot;Need for Speed: Most Wanted 5-1-0&quot;.

Police chases represent a significant body of the gameplay, and includes the free-roaming aspect of &quot;Underground 2&quot;, but with less extensive vehicle customization features. The story mode is a different style from &quot;Underground&quot;, with CGI effects mixed with live-action. The game featured the Blacklist, a crew consisting of 15 racers that the player must beat one-by-one to unlock parts, cars, tracks, and to complete career mode. The player had to meet certain requirements before they could take on the next Blacklist rival, such as races completed, milestones achieved, and bounty earned.

A special &quot;Black Edition&quot; of &quot;Most Wanted&quot; was also released, featuring additional races, challenges, and a few bonus cars; it also included a behind-the-scenes DVD. Both versions were available for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Windows-based PCs, while only the standard edition was available for GameCube, Nintendo DS, and Xbox 360.

&quot;Most Wanted&quot; had extremely positive reviews and received universal acclaim from reviewers in many gaming websites and magazines, praising the graphics, sound effects, and general gameplay. With 16 million copies sold worldwide, &quot;Most Wanted&quot; is the best-selling game in the franchise. A game, also named &quot;Need for Speed: Most Wanted&quot;, was released in 2012 with British developer Criterion Games responsible for the development.

====&quot;Need for Speed: Carbon&quot; (2006)====

&quot;Need for Speed: Carbon&quot; was developed by EA Black Box in 2006. It was the first &quot;NFS&quot; game for the PlayStation 3 and the Wii and the last &quot;NFS&quot; game for the GameCube, the Game Boy Advance, and the Xbox. &quot;Carbon&#x27;s&quot; handheld port is known as &quot;Need for Speed: Carbon – Own the City&quot;. The Wii port lacked online but made full use of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk.

&quot;NFS: Carbon&quot; continued the story from &quot;Most Wanted&quot;, but the game has far less emphasis on the police. &quot;Carbon&quot; saw the return of nighttime-only racing, with a selection of cars similar to that of &quot;Most Wanted&quot;. &quot;Carbon&quot; introduced a new feature wherein the player is allowed to form a &quot;crew&quot; that aids the player in races. Drift events returned to the series in &quot;Carbon&quot;. Drag racing was removed from the series, but a new type of race called &quot;Canyon Duel&quot; was added, where the closer the player is to the leader, the more points they accrue. If the player overtakes the leader and remains in front for 10 seconds, they win automatically. Another new feature is &quot;Autosculpt&quot;, which allows players to custom-fabricate their own auto parts.

The Collector&#x27;s Edition features three new cars, ten specially tuned cars, six new races, and a bonus DVD with behind-the-scenes footage on the making of the game.

====&quot;Need for Speed: ProStreet&quot; (2007)====
&quot;Need for Speed: ProStreet&quot;, developed by EA Black Box, was released in 2007. Key features of the game included realistic damage, a return to realistic racing, modeling, and burnouts. The game lacked the free roam mode found in earlier releases, instead, all of the races were on closed race tracks that took place on organized race days. The game consisted of drag races, speed challenges (essentially sprint races and speed traps), grip races (circuit racing), and drift races.

====&quot;Need for Speed: Undercover&quot; (2008)====
&quot;Need for Speed: Undercover&quot;, developed by EA Black Box, was released in 2008. The game had a significantly longer development cycle than previous games, taking 16 months to develop. EA ported &quot;Undercover&quot; to various mobile devices. It was the last &quot;Need for Speed&quot; game for PlayStation 2. EA Games president Frank Gibeau stated that since sales of &quot;ProStreet&quot; did not live up to EA&#x27;s projections, the franchise would go back to its &quot;roots&quot;. However, the game received lower scores on aggregate than &quot;ProStreet&quot;.

The game focused on tuning and police chases, featured over 50 cars, and took place in a fictional city called Tri-City Bay. The player&#x27;s role was as an undercover cop, trying to stop street racers. Containing live-action cutscenes that feature the actress Maggie Q, the game also featured a damage system where parts could break off after a crash.

The &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 added another five new cars, twelve new circuits, and sprint and checkpoint track configurations. Also included were specially tuned versions of ten existing cars, plus 35 exclusive vinyls for adding a unique visual style.

====&quot;Need for Speed: Shift&quot; (2009)====

&quot;Need for Speed: Shift&quot;, developed by Slightly Mad Studios, was released in 2009. It features over 60 cars and 19 tracks, some of which are licensed tracks while others are fictional. The improved driving simulation was accompanied by an adaptive difficulty, while it reintroduced a cockpit view. &quot;NFS: Shift&quot; focused on racing simulation rather than the arcade racing of previous titles.

&quot;NFS: Shift&quot; received better reviews than the prior three games in the series. The &quot;Special Edition&quot; contained a specially-tuned BMW M3 GT2, and an Elite Series track. Two items of downloadable content were released for the game.

====&quot;Need for Speed: Nitro&quot; (2009)====

&quot;Need for Speed: Nitro&quot; is the first &quot;NFS&quot; game made exclusively for Nintendo DS and Wii, featuring arcade-style gameplay and targeting a casual audience, released in 2009. &quot;Need for Speed: Nitro&quot; was also available as a social multiplayer game on Facebook.

&quot;Need for Speed: Nitro-X&quot; (2010) is a newer installment for use with the DSi/XL and the 3DS system. Essentially the original release, it was updated with several updates: 18 licensed vehicles; new police units; custom tags; 16 updated tracks; a revised career mode; local multiplayer matches for up to four players; and new rewards and unlockables. The game was released as a digital download only, released in 2010.

====&quot;Need for Speed: World&quot; (2010)====
&quot;Need for Speed: World&quot; was a free-to-play MMO racing game for Windows-based PCs. It took on the gameplay style of &quot;Most Wanted&quot; and &quot;Carbon&quot;, focusing on illegal street racing, tuning and police chases, and adding classic MMO elements to the mix. &quot;World&quot; incorporated almost exact replicas of the cities of Rockport and Palmont, the cities of &quot;Most Wanted&quot; and &quot;Carbon&quot; respectively, into its map design. &quot;World&quot; was originally scheduled for an Asian release in the summer of 2009, but the game was not released at that time and it was released worldwide in 2010. The game was in public beta-testing limited to residents of Taiwan in October 2009

&quot;Need for Speed World&quot; closed its servers in July 2015. They soon after removed the ability to create new accounts for the game and began winding down their support for it. Leading up to closure, there were several &quot;end of the world&quot; promotions and in-game events held.

====&quot;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit&quot; (2010)====
&quot;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit&quot; was developed by British games developer Criterion Games and published by Electronic Arts in 2010. It focuses on racing and police chases rather than car customization. The game won many awards at the E3 2010, including &quot;Best Racing Game&quot;, becoming the first game in the &quot;NFS&quot; series since the original &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot; to win an E3 award.

There were over 60 cars, most available to both racers and cops, but a few were exclusive to either side. Unlike previous &quot;NFS&quot; titles, there was no customization, and the game takes place in a fictional rural area called Seacrest County, which the &quot;free roam&quot; feature lets you explore. &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot; allows play as either police or racer. The game also features many weapons, with some exclusive to the cops or racers. The biggest feature introduced was Autolog, which tracked player progressions and recommended events to play. In addition to its statistical system, Autolog also features Facebook-like speedwalls where players can post their comments and photos while in the game. &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot; has received some of the best reviews of the series.

The &quot;Limited Edition&quot; gives players exclusive access to the Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione and Ford Shelby GT500. Various downloadable content was released for the game.

A remastered version of the game, &quot;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered&quot;, was released in November 2020 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Microsoft Windows. It features cross-platform multiplayer, enhanced visuals, quality-of-life improvements, all main DLC from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, the return of Autolog, and 4K support for PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox One X, and Windows.

====&quot;Shift 2: Unleashed&quot; (2011)====

The sequel to &quot;Need for Speed: Shift&quot;, &quot;Shift 2: Unleashed&quot; was developed by Slightly Mad Studios, and released in 2011. &quot;Shift 2&quot; includes the Autolog feature introduced in &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot;. It also includes features such as night racing, an in-helmet camera, and a more in-depth career mode. &quot;Shift 2&quot; features more than 140 vehicles available for racing and tuning, a smaller number compared with other racing games such as &quot;Forza Motorsport 3&quot; and &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot;. There are also 40 real-world locations including Bathurst, Spa-Francorchamps and Suzuka as well as fictional circuits.

The &quot;Limited Edition&quot; features three unlocked cars, and an additional 37 career race events. Two downloadable contents were released for &quot;Shift 2&quot;.

====&quot;Need for Speed: The Run&quot; (2011)====
&quot;Need for Speed: The Run&quot; was developed by EA Black Box, and released in 2011. The game continued the street-racing gameplay of Black Box&#x27;s previous titles, with a story based on a race across the United States from San Francisco to New York.

The game featured quick time events with the player, for the first time in &quot;NFS&quot; history, exiting their car and traveling on foot. &quot;The Run&quot; was powered by DICE&#x27;s Frostbite 2 engine, making the game the first non-shooter and one of the first console titles to use the engine. Additionally, the &quot;NFS&quot; Autolog was also used in the game.

&quot;The Run&quot; employs a large range of real-world vehicles, which can be altered with visual upgrades. An XP (Experience points) system is used for unlocking cars and events. The &quot;Limited Edition&quot; features three exclusive cars and five exclusive challenges with bonus rewards and achievements.

====&quot;Need for Speed: Most Wanted&quot; (2012)====
&quot;Need for Speed: Most Wanted&quot; was developed by British games developer Criterion Games, and released in 2012. The game picked up on the &quot;Most Wanted&quot; IP, as opposed to the &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot; extension. This was the first game made subsequent to Criterion Games taking over the &quot;NFS&quot; series from Black Box.

It features open-world racing, and most of the cars in the game are available from the start, hidden in different locations. It also features a blacklist of 10 instead of 15, and there is no story or visual customization for the game. It is powered by Autolog 2.0. Performance upgrades are available for all the cars in the game, such as chassis, tires, nitrous, and bodywork. Milestones and achievements are unlocked through a variety of ways, e.g. completion of races and breaking through billboards.

====&quot;Need for Speed Rivals&quot; (2013)====
&quot;Need for Speed: Rivals&quot; was developed by Ghost Games (formerly EA Gothenburg) in association with Criterion Games, and was released in 2013 for the PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Xbox One. It runs on DICE&#x27;s Frostbite 3 Engine. It has the same basic concept as &quot;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit&quot;, but with new features like the AllDrive system, and several pursuit techs.

====&quot;Need for Speed: No Limits&quot; (2015)====
&quot;Need for Speed: No Limits&quot; was released in 2015 for iOS and Android, and a mobile installment in the &quot;Need for Speed&quot; video game series, developed by Firemonkeys Studios and published by Electronic Arts. It is the franchise&#x27;s first original title made exclusively for mobile devices, unlike past mobile games in the series that were simply adaptations of various &quot;Need for Speed&quot; games.

====&quot;Need for Speed&quot; (2015)====
A full reboot of the franchise developed by Ghost Games, the game was released in 2015 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with a release for Microsoft Windows via Origin in 2016.

Set in Ventura Bay, the game has five different gameplay styles in which points are collected in order to progress through five overlapping storylines, in addition having a redesigned &#x27;Wrap Editor&#x27; and body car modifications.

The PC version was released in 2016 via Origin in two different editions. The Standard Edition is the base edition, whereas the Deluxe Edition has the styling pack, performance pack, tricked-out starter car, exclusive wraps, unique identifying stickers, VIP icons, and a lifetime discount on all items using the in-game currency.

====&quot;Need for Speed Payback&quot; (2017)====
EA and Ghost Games released &quot;Need for Speed Payback&quot; in 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The game has an offline single-player mode unlike the previous title. &quot;Payback&quot; is set in Fortune Valley. The game is focused on &quot;action driving&quot; and has three playable characters (each with different sets of skills) working together to pull off action movie-like sequences, in addition having a 24-hour day-night cycle.

====&quot;Need for Speed Heat&quot; (2019)====
&quot;Need for Speed Heat&quot; was released in 2019 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game is set in Palm City. Unlike the previous title, which featured a full day-night cycle, the time of day can be switched when needed between a day and night period, with each period offering different races and payouts. &quot;Heat&quot; is similar to other titles and features a &quot;Heat&quot; system in which players earn rep when participating in police pursuits, with greater amounts offered during night than in the day. This was the last title released by Ghost Games before its dissolvement in 2020, after which Criterion took full creative oversight of the franchise.

====&quot;Need for Speed Unbound&quot; (2022)====

Revealed by EA in October 2022, &quot;Need for Speed Unbound&quot; is developed by Criterion with assistance from Codemasters. The game features a cel-shaded art style for its characters and vehicle effects while retaining the photo-realistic look of the cars from previous games. The map is based in a fictional city inspired by Chicago called Lakeshore City. The game was released on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC on December 2, 2022. American rapper ASAP Rocky appears as a character in the storyline, driving a modified Mercedes 190E.

===Other games===
====&quot;Need for Speed: V-Rally&quot; (1997)====

When &quot;V-Rally&quot; was released in 1997, it was developed by Infogrames Multimedia and had no connection with the &quot;Need for Speed&quot; games. Electronic Arts acquired the rights to publish the PlayStation version of the game in the United States in order to help sales of the game, due to the fact that rally racing held little support in the U.S. The game was not originally intended to be part of the &quot;Need for Speed&quot; series; neither the game&#x27;s development was done by Electronic Arts Canada (which at the time was the primary developer of the &quot;Need for Speed&quot; series), nor was it developed in as association with Electronic Arts in any way. Later versions of the game were solely published by Infogrames and were released under their original names.

====&quot;Need for Speed 64&quot; (canceled)====
In the late 1990s, EA Canada partnered with Paradigm to work on an entry in the series for the Nintendo 64. It was described in the &quot;Next Generation&quot; magazine as having exclusive tracks and vehicles, Rumble Pak support and the series&#x27; trademark gameplay mechanics. The game was ultimately canceled between late 1998 and early 1999. Electronic Arts had signed a deal with Volkswagen to make a game around the New Beetle, thus altering the &quot;Need for Speed 64&quot; project into &quot;Beetle Adventure Racing&quot;.

====&quot;Need for Speed: V-Rally 2&quot; (1999)====

Much like with the original &quot;V-Rally&quot;, EA purchased the rights to publish the PlayStation version of &quot;V-Rally 2&quot; in North America. Infogrames published the Dreamcast version of the game in North America as &quot;Test Drive: V-Rally&quot;. Later games in the series would have no connections to either &quot;Need for Speed&quot; or &quot;Test Drive&quot;.

====&quot;Need for Speed: Web Racing&quot; (2001)====
&quot;Need for Speed: Web Racing&quot; was an online-only conversion of &quot;Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit&quot; made available in 2001 as part of EA.com&#x27;s Platinum service. 11 cars and various courses from &quot;Need for Speed III&quot; were included, as well as one course from the first &quot;Need for Speed&quot;. Single-player and Multiplayer modes were made available.

====&quot;Motor City Online&quot; (2001)====

Originally conceived as part of the &quot;Need for Speed&quot; series under the title &quot;Need for Speed: Motor City&quot;, during development all single-player elements would be discarded in favor of an online-only model. The result, &quot;Motor City Online&quot;, was a racing MMO game released by EA on October 29, 2001. The point of the game was to buy classic cars, tune them, and race them against other players. The game went offline less than two years later to enable EA to focus on &quot;The Sims Online&quot;. Later, EA would develop a new online racing game, called &quot;Need for Speed: World&quot;.

====&quot;Need for Speed: Top Speed&quot; (2002)====
&quot;Need for Speed: Top Speed&quot; was an online-only promotional racing game released on October 1, 2002, as part of EA Pogo and America Online&#x27;s online-only AOL Games&#x27; First Play programming initiative. Made to promote both MacGillivray Freeman&#x27;s 2002 IMAX film &quot;Top Speed&quot; and the then-new Porsche Cayenne Turbo, the game uses three existing courses from &quot;Porsche Unleashed&quot; renamed to refer to Canadian locations due to the sponsorship of Travel Alberta Canada.

====&quot;Need for Speed 10: TerrorFive&quot; (canceled)====
&quot;Need for Speed 10: TerrorFive&quot; was a concept pitched to Electronic Arts around 2008. The portfolio page of a former presentation director of EA Black Box says the &quot;goal&quot; of the game was to answer the question &quot;How can large scale street races take place in a post 911 US city?&quot; Concept art depicts a group of street racers named &quot;TerrorFive&quot;, alongside a mockup of gameplay in which players seemingly hack into police cars.

==== &quot;Need for Speed: Millionaire&quot; (canceled) ====
&quot;Need for Speed: Millionaire&quot; was a canceled online-only entry developed by Criterion Games, which started development around 2008 after the release of &quot;Burnout Paradise&quot; and &quot;Need For Speed: Undercover&quot;. It would have seen the player and friends go on adventures after a lottery win and the purchase of many supercars, described by Criterion director Alex Ward as &quot;Freeburn meets Top Gear challenges&quot;. The game was worked on for six months and had a playable version, but was canceled in favor of &quot;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit&quot;.

====&quot;Need for Speed: Edge&quot; (canceled)====
&quot;Need for Speed: Edge&quot; was a free-to-play MMO racing game developed by EA Spearhead (formerly EA Korea) and published by Nexon from South Korea and Tencent Interactive Entertainment (known as &quot;Need for Speed Online&quot;) from China. It is the third free-to-play game in the franchise overall, along with being the only free-to-play racing game that runs on the Frostbite 3 game engine. The PC version is based on the 2013 title &quot;Need for Speed Rivals&quot;, while the mobile version (sometimes referred to as &quot;Need for Speed: Duel&quot;) is based on &quot;Need for Speed: No Limits&quot;. The open beta was released on December 10, 2017. Nexon shut down the game on May 30, 2019.

====&quot;Need for Speed Mobile&quot; (upcoming)====
&quot;Need for Speed Mobile&quot; (known as &quot;Need for Speed: Assemble&quot; in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau) is an upcoming free-to-play Open world racing mobile game developed by TiMi Studios and published by Electronic Arts for worldwide and Tencent Interactive Entertainment for China and Garena for Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. The game runs on the Unreal Engine 4, this is the first and also only game which runs on Unreal Engine in the series. The game released on July 11, 2024 in China, and released on October 31, 2024 in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.

==Film adaptation==

EA worked with DreamWorks Pictures to create a film version of &quot;Need for Speed&quot; starring Aaron Paul as Tobey Marshall, a mechanic and street racer who was framed by a wealthy business associate. The movie was released by Disney&#x27;s Touchstone Pictures on March 14, 2014, months before the franchise&#x27;s 20th anniversary. Despite receiving negative reviews, the film ended up grossing over $200 million at the worldwide box office.

In April 2015, a sequel was reported to be produced by China Movie Channel, Jiaflix, and 1905.com in association with EA Games.

<text>Axiomatic semantics is an approach based on mathematical logic for proving the correctness of computer programs. It is closely related to Hoare logic.

Axiomatic semantics define the meaning of a command in a program by describing its effect on assertions about the program state. The assertions are logical statements—predicates with variables, where the variables define the state of the program.

<doc id="518200" wikidata="Q1968342" url="?curid=518200" title="Official scorer">
<text>In the game of baseball, the official scorer is a person appointed by the league to record the events on the field, and to send the official scoring record of the game back to the league offices. In addition to recording the events on the field such as the outcome of each plate appearance and the circumstances of any baserunner&#x27;s advance around the bases, the official scorer is also charged with making judgment calls that do not affect the progress or outcome of the game. Judgment calls are primarily made about errors, unearned runs, fielder&#x27;s choice, the value of hits in certain situations, and wild pitches, all of which are included in the record compiled. This record is used to compile statistics for each player and team. A box score is a summary of the official scorer&#x27;s game record.

Newspaper writers initially performed this function in the early days of Major League Baseball (MLB). As the importance of baseball player statistics increased, teams began to pressure writer-scorers for favorable scoring decisions for their players in games played at home stadiums, and a home team scoring bias was perceived by many coaches, players, and writers. Controversies related to perceived bias or errors in scoring have led to questions about important baseball records, including several no-hitters and Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s 56-game hitting streak of 1941. By 1979, many major newspapers decided to ban their writers from scoring baseball games due to conflict-of-interest concerns, and in 1980 MLB began to hire independent official scorers.

Since 1980, some reforms have been suggested to improve the performance of official scorers. In 2001, MLB formed a scoring committee to review their performance, and by 2008 the committee was given the authority to overturn scoring decisions. This authority was used by the scoring committee three times during the 2009 season. In 2006, an academic study seemed to confirm the historical existence of a home-team bias in scoring decisions, but this measurable bias decreased after 1979.

==History==

Henry Chadwick is generally credited with the invention of scorekeeping in baseball. Chadwick was also the inventor of the modern box score and the writer of the first rule book for the game of baseball. Since baseball statistics were initially a subject of interest to sportswriters, the role of the official scorer in Major League Baseball (MLB) in the early days of the sport was performed by newspaper writers. A judgment call that is required by the official scorer does not alter the outcome of a game, but these judgments impact the statistical records of the game. As the subjective scoring decisions which are used to calculate baseball statistics began to be used to determine the relative value of baseball players, MLB began to require approval from the league before a writer-scorer could be assigned to produce the scoring report for a game. By the 1970s, writers who were willing to score games for MLB were required to have attended 100 or more games per year in the prior three years and to be chosen by the local chapter chairman of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA). Qualified candidates for scoring were submitted to the leagues for approval.

===Early controversies===

Baseball writer-scorers usually worked at the games played at the home stadium of the team which they covered for their newspaper. The writer-scorers were tasked with making objective decisions that could impact the statistics of the team they were writing about. Because of this affiliation, the official scorer was often presumed by the baseball players and managers to favor the home team when making the required judgment calls during the course of a game.

Criticism of scoring decisions date to the earliest days of the game. Some historians claim that Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s record 56-game hitting streak in 1941 was made possible by several generous rulings at Yankee Stadium. In 1953, Al Rosen narrowly missed being recognized for achieving a rare &quot;triple crown&quot; in hitting after a questioned error caused him to finish the season one hit short of winning the American League batting title.

Although scoring decisions were widely believed to favor the hitter over the defense, many players believed this bias shifts in favor of the pitcher when he carries a no-hitter (where a pitcher throws a complete game without giving up a hit) into the late innings. Infielder Davey Johnson said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been involved in five or six no-hit games, and all of them were suspected of being helped by hometown scoring.&quot; One of the last controversies of the writer-scorer era was seen in a 1978 game at St. Louis. In that game, St. Louis pitcher Bob Forsch was pitching a no-hitter in the 8th inning against Philadelphia when a hard ground ball hit into the hole between shortstop and third was narrowly missed by third baseman Ken Reitz. The official scorer Neal Russo (who was a writer for a local newspaper) judged the play to be an error rather than a hit, and Forsch went on to pitch the first no-hitter of the 1978 season.

===Newspaper reaction===

A player&#x27;s baseball statistics can increase or reduce the leverage which he may have in future contract negotiations. Many players also have monetary incentives written in their contracts which are based on statistical measurements, and official scorers have the option to reverse a scoring decision within 24 hours of the conclusion of a game. Because of this, baseball writer-scorers were often subject to pressure from the players they were covering in their newspaper. After a game in 1962, infielder Jerry Adair asked for a meeting with local writer Neal Eskridge after learning that he was the scorer for the game. Angry about an error he had received in the game, Jerry &quot;cursed [Neal] thoroughly and imaginatively, and told him, &#x27;Never talk to me again. They reportedly did not speak to each other for almost four years. In the early days of baseball, a disagreement over a scoring decision occasionally led to physical altercations between the player and the writer. Confrontational incidents decreased after 1974 following a warning from MLB.

The pressure and the perceived conflict of interest faced by the baseball writers who scored games for MLB eventually led many major newspapers to end the practice for their employees. In 1958, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; prohibited their writers from scoring baseball games. Over the next two decades other major newspapers joined in the writer-scorer ban, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, and the major daily newspapers published in Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia. In 1980, MLB resolved the conflict by directly hiring official scorers for each stadium.

===After 1980===
Today, the MLB commissioner&#x27;s office directly employs the official scorers who are responsible for producing score reports, although most scorers are hired on the recommendation of the public relations directors of baseball teams. Official scorers are typically retired writers, coaches, and umpires. Unlike umpiring teams, MLB official scorers do not typically travel between stadiums. Each official scorer is assigned to a stadium for the season, with each stadium having one or more scorers. Scorers now have access to replay video from different angles which they can review before making a decision. As of 2012, MLB official scorers earned $150 per game. Official scorers are not required to meet the old BBWAA requirements, and are also no longer required to pass a written test, which was once administered by the National League before it was phased out in the mid-1990s. Potential scorers are generally required to briefly apprentice under an existing scorer before they are allowed to work alone.

Official scorers are only occasionally terminated, but there have been cases when a scorer was replaced after making decisions which displeased the home team. In 1992 the Seattle Mariner players signed a petition to have their official scorer replaced, and in 2001 the management of the Boston Red Sox ordered that a rookie scorer not be allowed to score another game after pitcher Hideo Nomo lost a no-hitter on a close play in right field that was ruled a hit rather than an error.
In 2001, MLB formed a scoring committee to evaluate the performance of official scorers. In 2008, the scoring committee was given the authority to enforce the portion of rule 10.01(a) which allows the league to change a scoring decision that is &quot;clearly erroneous&quot;. The committee has used this authority on a few occasions, having overturned three scoring decisions in the 2009 season. The scoring committee came under some scrutiny after a game on August 31, 2008. Milwaukee pitcher CC Sabathia threw a disputed 7–0 one-hit shutout against Pittsburgh. Milwaukee manager Ned Yost argued that the hit recorded by Pittsburgh should have been recorded as an error by the pitcher, but Pittsburgh official scorer Bob Webb disagreed. Yost commented, &quot;That&#x27;s a joke. That wasn&#x27;t even close. Whoever the scorekeeper was absolutely denied major league baseball a nice no-hitter right there.&quot; The official scorer had argued that the batter was too close to first base to be put out by a clean play. Milwaukee appealed the ruling to the scoring committee, but on September 3 the committee reviewed the footage and supported the ruling by Webb, saying the ruling was not &quot;clearly erroneous&quot; as required by rule 10.01(a).

===Outside MLB===
Official scorers in the minor leagues are generally hired by the teams to score games at their stadium. Some minor league scorers have a history or connection with the team, including former players, former coaches, and local writers. Official scorers for international baseball competitions are generally selected by the organizer of the competition.

==Analysis and proposed changes==
Baseball players, managers, and writers have speculated about bias by the official scorer for decades, but this subject has been objectively studied only recently. In 2006, the rate at which errors have been recorded in MLB by the official scorer was investigated under many situations. The rate at which errors are called is higher when the quality of fielding is suspect and is lower when playing conditions are better, but these factors do not fully explain variations in error rate. After other known factors are accounted for, evidence was found that official scorers are biased toward the home team, but that this bias was reduced after the end of the writer-scorer era in 1979. Further, errors are significantly more likely to be called in the National League than in the American League.

Changes have been proposed over the years to reduce possible inconsistencies between scorers and possible mistakes made by the official scorer, especially as the end of the writer-scorer era began to seem likely in the late 1970s. The BBWAA and professional baseball umpires have suggested the creation of a &quot;fifth umpire&quot;. Four-man umpire crews rotate officiating responsibilities after each game, and travel to several stadiums per year. This new fifth umpire would travel with the umpiring crew to score games and take his turn on the bases, but MLB has been reluctant to incur the increased cost. More recently, there have been suggestions to move the official scorer out of the press box and closer to the field behind the plate to get the best view of the game. MLB has conceded that this could be a good idea, but it is not currently feasible because of the design of most stadiums in the league.

==Responsibilities==
The rules which govern the official scorer are spelled out in Rule 10 of the official rules of baseball. The fundamental responsibilities of the official scorer are explained in rule 10.01.

===Rule 10.01===
The rules of baseball require that the official scorer views the game only from the press box, for two basic reasons. First, this ensures that every scorer has nearly the same perspective of the game. One of the intentions of this rule is to improve consistency in scorekeeping decisions between different official scorers working on different games at the same stadium, and between scorers in different stadiums. Second, the press box is the most neutral position within the stadium. Seated in the press box, the official scorer is surrounded by writers and broadcasters who are ostensibly neutral, and the scorer is less likely to be unduly influenced by the players, the coaches, and the crowd.

Rule 10.01 states that the scorer is never allowed to make scorekeeping decisions that conflict with the official rules governing scorekeeping. The official scorer is permitted to view available replays and to solicit the opinions of others, but the official scorer is given the sole authority to make the judgment calls that are required in the score report. When a judgment call is made, the official scorer is obligated to immediately communicate that decision to the media in the press box and to the broadcasters, usually through a microphone. The official scorer has up to 24 hours to reconsider or reverse a judgment call that was made during the game. In rare circumstances, MLB&#x27;s scoring committee may reverse a scoring decision that is &quot;clearly erroneous&quot;.

Finally, within 36 hours of a game&#x27;s conclusion (including the conclusion of a suspended game), the official scorer is required to create a summary of the game using a form established by the league. This task is performed for each game that is scored, including called games which must be completely replayed at a later date, and games that end in forfeit. The information in the score report includes the date, location of the game, the names of the teams, the names of the umpires who officiated the game, the final score, and the data that is required in rule 10.02.

===Judgment calls===
Most plays in the game are resolved in such a way that the scorer is not given multiple choices when recording the outcome of the play, but several types of plays are open to the interpretation of the official scorer. In any judgment call where the official scorer is required to decide whether to credit a hit to the batter, the scorer is guided by rule 10.05. This rule directs the official scorer to &quot;give the benefit of the doubt to the hitter when the scorer believes that the decision to credit the batter with a hit is equally valid to an alternative scoring decision&quot;. In a similarly difficult judgment call where the official scorer believes that an earned run or an unearned run are equally valid scoring decisions, rule 10.16 directs the official scorer to &quot;give the benefit of the doubt to the pitcher&quot;.

====Errors====
The decision to charge an error to the defense is the most well-known responsibility of the official scorer. Some situations automatically call for an error to be charged to the defense, but most charged errors are the result of a play that requires a judgment call. Broadly speaking, an error is charged to the defense when an &quot;ordinary effort&quot; by the defense would have either recorded an out or prevented a runner from advancing, but the defense fails to do so. When an error is charged, the official scorer must charge the error to one of the fielders who were involved in the play. Errors are primarily discussed in rule 10.12.

One exception in this rule occurs when the defense makes at least one out and attempts to complete a double play or triple play. An error is not charged in that situation if a wild throw allows the runner to reach safely. If a wild throw allows the runner to advance an additional base, an error may then be charged for the additional advance. However, if an accurate throw is made in time to complete a double play or triple play, but the fielder on the base fails to make the catch, an error may be charged.

Rule 10.12 also states that an error should not be charged for a &quot;mental mistake&quot; by the defense. Rather, errors are charged when the defense attempts to make a logical play against the offense, but fails to record an out or prevent an advance due to a mechanical misplay. There is one rare exception to this rule against charging an error for a &quot;mental mistake&quot;. If a fielder fails to tag the runner, batter, or a base in a force situation in time to record an out when he could have done so, that fielder is charged with an error.

The most common judgment call involving an error occurs when the defense fails to put out a batter-runner who puts the ball in play. If the out is not recorded and the official scorer believes that an &quot;ordinary effort&quot; by the defense would have resulted in an out, the defense is charged with an error, and the batter is not credited with a hit. Other common situations requiring a judgment call include unintentionally dropped foul balls that allow the batter to continue his at-bat, and poor throws to the next base when a runner attempts to advance.

One of the most controversial and poorly understood situations related to the charging of an error occurs when an outfielder misjudges the flight of a ball and allows the ball to drop out of his reach. This is usually considered to be a &quot;mental mistake&quot; by the outfielder, so the batter is usually credited with a hit. On that topic Bill Shannon, who was an official scorer for the New York Yankees, said &quot;That&#x27;s a base hit whether we like it or not. As a practical matter, we don&#x27;t charge errors on those plays. No one says that baseball is entirely fair.&quot; Outfielders are generally charged with an error on a fly ball when they arrive at the ball&#x27;s destination with sufficient time to make a catch with an ordinary effort, but simply miss the catch or drop the ball.

====Unearned runs====
Earned runs are runs that are directly attributable to a pitcher&#x27;s efforts without a lapse by the defense. An unearned run does not adversely impact a pitcher&#x27;s earned run average (ERA), and is only possible when an error (including catcher&#x27;s interference) or a passed ball occurs earlier in the inning. Unearned runs are primarily discussed in rule 10.16 and often require a judgment call by the official scorer.

At the conclusion of an inning during which runs are scored after an error or passed ball, the official scorer attempts to recreate the events of the inning without the errors or passed balls. If in the official scorer&#x27;s opinion a run would not have scored without the defensive lapses, then the run is unearned. If the scorer believes that a run would have scored anyway, the run is earned and charged to the pitcher. In one basic example, if the first batter reaches by an error, the second batter hits a home run, and the next three batters strike out, then one of the two runs scored was unearned. There are rules and restrictions which govern this general guideline.

When reconstructing an inning without errors or passed balls:

* Potential outs that were not recorded because of an error are presumed to be an out when the inning is reconstructed by the official scorer.
* Intentional walks which were issued are still presumed to be walks.
* Runs that are scored after what should have been the third out are automatically considered to be unearned.
* When the batter is given first base because of catcher&#x27;s interference or obstruction, the official scorer does not presume that an out would have been recorded on that runner, but if that runner later scores the run is unearned.
* A run scored by a runner who advances due to an error or passed ball is unearned, unless it would not have made a difference in the reconstruction of the inning.

Most of the above rules are straightforward, but some judgment is required by the official scorer when a baserunner advances due to a defensive lapse and later scores. In this situation, the official scorer must decide what would have happened if the runner had not advanced. This is often an easy decision, but it can occasionally be difficult. In one difficult example with a runner on first and two outs, the batter hits a single but a defensive error allows an advance by the lead runner from second to third, and a soft run-scoring single is hit followed by an out. In that situation, the offense &quot;should&quot; have had runners on first and second with 2 outs when the run-scoring single was hit. Since the next batter was put out, the official scorer must decide based on the hit, the speed of the baserunner, and the positioning of the defense whether the runner would have been able to score from second in the reconstruction of the inning without the error.

====Fielder&#x27;s choice====
In the rules of baseball, aside from the rare case of interference or obstruction, a batter who puts a ball into play and safely reaches first base is ruled to have reached in one of three possible ways: a hit, an error, or by fielder&#x27;s choice. Fielder&#x27;s choice is primarily discussed in rules 10.05 and 10.06, and it generally occurs when it is judged that a batter-runner would have been put out had the defense chosen to do so.

Most judgment calls made by the official scorer under this rule occur in three situations: when an infielder, pitcher, or catcher attempts to put out an unforced preceding runner who is attempting to advance one base, when any fielder attempts and fails to put out a forced preceding runner, and when any fielder attempts and fails to put out an unforced preceding runner who returns to their original base. In these situations, the official scorer is required to determine whether the batter-runner would have safely reached first base if the defense made an ordinary effort to put him out. If the defense could not be reasonably expected to make the play, the batter is credited with a hit, otherwise he is ruled to have reached by fielder&#x27;s choice. If an error is made on the attempt to put out a preceding runner, that has no impact on this decision. It is instead noted to have occurred in addition to the hit or fielder&#x27;s choice.

In some cases the official scorer is not given the discretion to decide between awarding a hit to the batter or ruling that he safely reached first base by fielder&#x27;s choice. If a preceding runner is forced out or if an unforced preceding runner is put out while attempting to return to their original base, a hit is automatically not credited and the batter by rule is judged to have reached by a fielder&#x27;s choice. In some situations this rule may appear unfair to the batter. For example, if the batter is a fast runner, the ball is slowly hit to the third baseman, and an unforced runner from second realizes (too late) that he can not safely advance, the batter-runner will lose the potential hit on a fielder&#x27;s choice by the third baseman. This occurs regardless of whether the batter-runner would have reached first base with an ordinary effort to put him out.

====Value of hits====
In cases where a batter indisputably gets a hit and is able to safely advance past first base on the play, the value of that hit may be adjusted by the official scorer because of an error or a fielder&#x27;s choice.

If the defense attempts to put out a preceding runner during the play, the official scorer must determine whether the batter would have reached second or third base safely had the defense attempted to limit the batter&#x27;s advance. For example, if a runner on second attempts to score after a soft hit to center field and the center fielder chooses to throw to home while the batter advances to second, the official scorer must decide the value of the hit. In this situation, the scorer may either choose to credit the batter with a double, or the scorer may rule that the batter hit a single with an advance to second by fielder&#x27;s choice. This is often referred to as &quot;an advance on the throw&quot;.

If an error occurs during the play when a batter records a hit, the official scorer must determine whether the batter would have advanced as far as he did had the error not occurred. For example, if a batter hits a ball into an outfield gap, the ball is badly misplayed by an outfielder attempting to retrieve and throw the ball back into the infield, and the batter is able to reach all four bases to score, then the official scorer must decide whether an error should be charged to the outfielder. If no error is charged, then the batter would be credited with an &quot;inside the park&quot; home run. If an error is charged to the outfielder, then the batter would likely be credited with either a double or triple.

====Wild pitch====
When a baserunner is able to advance after a pitch is not caught or controlled by the catcher, the official scorer must determine whether the advance was due to a wild pitch or a passed ball. The pitch is never considered to be an error. If a pitch is thrown so high, wide, or low in relation to the strike zone that a catcher is not able to catch or control the ball with ordinary effort before a runner can advance, the advance is ruled to have occurred by a wild pitch. Any such pitch which strikes the ground before it reaches home plate is automatically considered to be a wild pitch. However, a pitch is not a wild pitch merely because it is off-target. If the official scorer determines that the catcher should have been able to control the pitch and prevent an advance with ordinary effort, then the catcher is charged with a passed ball on the advance.

One exception to this rule occurs when a baserunner attempts to steal a base. If the runner &quot;starts for the next base&quot; before the pitcher delivers the pitch, the runner is credited with a stolen base and a wild pitch or passed ball is not charged. If a wild pitch or passed ball allows a runner to advance beyond the base that is stolen, the scorer may rule that the further advance occurred by a wild pitch or passed ball.

====Other judgment calls====
Some relatively uncommon situations may also require a judgment call by the official scorer.

When a defensive player has the ball and can end the play by preventing further advance, but fails to do so because of a mental mistake (not an error) and a runner subsequently scores, the official scorer must decide whether to credit the batter with a run batted in (RBI). If the runner recognized the mistake after slowing or pausing his advance, an RBI is not credited. If the runner was oblivious to the mistake or runs home without slowing, the batter is credited with an RBI.

If a runner advances because the defense does nothing to try to stop the advance, the scorer may rule that the advance was due to defensive indifference and no stolen base is credited. However, a throw is not required for a stolen base. If a fielder begins to visibly make an attempt to prevent an advance but then elects not to throw, the advance is not due to defensive indifference.

When a batter attempts a sacrifice bunt and the resulting bunt is so well-placed that he safely reaches first base, the official scorer may elect to credit the batter with a hit instead of a sacrifice if there is no error on the play and an ordinary effort by the defense would not have recorded an out.

Finally, when the starting pitcher of the winning team does not qualify for the win under rule 10.17, and the relief pitcher who would otherwise qualify for the win pitches &quot;ineffectively&quot; in a &quot;brief appearance&quot;, the official scorer may choose to credit a &quot;succeeding relief pitcher&quot; with the win.

<text>Norbert of Xanten, O. Praem (c. 1075 – 6 June 1134) (Gennep-Magdeburg), also known as Norbert Gennep, was Archbishop of Magdeburg, founder of the Premonstratensian order of canons regular, and is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church. Norbert was canonized by Pope Gregory XIII in the year 1582, and his statue appears above the Piazza colonnade of St. Peter&#x27;s Square in Rome.

== Early life ==
St. Norbert pursued worldly pleasures in the early part of his life. Even after he was ordained a subdeacon, he continued to live in a state of worldliness. He declined higher religious roles because he didn&#x27;t want the restraints that came with the positions.

He later underwent a profound conversion after he was thrown from a horse when a bolt of lightning frightened the animal. Following this incident, he went to Xanten and pursued a devout, penitent life.

== Early priesthood ==
He adopted such strict discipline that it killed his first three disciples. This may be why he failed to reform the canons of Xanten, who denounced him as an innovator at the Council of Fritzlar in 1118. He then resigned his benefice, sold all his property and gave the proceeds to the poor. He visited Pope Gelasius II, who gave him permission to become an itinerant preacher and he preached throughout lands in what is now western Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and northern France, being credited with a number of miracles. In settlement after settlement he encountered a demoralized clergy, lonely, often practicing concubinage and feeling that the official Church cared little about them.

In Paris he would have witnessed the Canons of St. Victor, who had adopted the ascetic ideals of William of Champeaux. At Clairvaux and Citeaux he would have seen the Cistercian reforms among the monks. He also became acquainted with the Cistercian administrative system that created an international federation of monasteries with fair amount of centralized power, though local houses had a certain amount of independence. These reforms, written up in their “Charter of Charity” would affect him significantly in his own future work.

==Canons Regular of Prémontré==
At the Council of Reims in October 1119, Pope Calixtus II requested Norbert to found a religious order in the Diocese of Laon in France. On Christmas Day, 1120, Norbert established the Canons Regular of Prémontré.

For a Rule of life, Norbert chose the Rule of St. Augustine as was common among communities of priests -‘canons’. In addition he adapted some of the customs of the Cistercians. Even more of these would be brought in later by Norbert&#x27;s successor, Abbot Hugh of Fosse. In effect he produced a community that would be somewhat monastic as far as house ministry. The whole idea was that his active priests needed an ascetic and contemplative haven and that was the purpose of the abbey discipline.

Norbert chose a valley in the Forest of Coucy (a grant from Barthélemy de Jur, the Bishop of Laon), about 10 miles from Laon, named Prémontré. Hugh of Fosses, Evermode of Ratzeburg, Antony of Nivelles, seven students of the celebrated school of Anselm, and Ralph of Laon were among his first thirteen disciples. By the next year the community had grown to 40. They all took their vows and the Order of Canons Regular of Prémontré was founded. The young community at first lived in huts of wood and clay, arranged like a camp around the chapel of Saint John the Baptist, but they soon built a larger church and a monastery for the religious who joined them in increasing numbers. Going to Cologne to obtain relics for their church, Norbert is said to have discovered, through a dream, the spot where those of Ursula and her companions, of Gereon, and of other martyrs lay hidden. In 1125/6, the constitution for the order was approved by Pope Honorius II.

Norbert gained adherents in Germany, France, Belgium and Hungary, and houses of his order were founded in Floreffe, Viviers, St-Josse, Ardenne, Cuissy, Laon, Liège, Antwerp, Varlar, Kappenberg, Nagyvárad (Oradea/Großwardein) and elsewhere. Count Theobald II of Champagne wanted to enter the new order, but Norbert counseled him to remain a layman and marry. Norbert prescribed a few rules and invested Theobald with the white scapular of the order, and thus, in 1122, the Third Order of St. Norbert was instituted. He continued to preach throughout France, Belgium and Germany and was successful in combatting a eucharistic heresy in Antwerp proposed by one Tanchelm. In commemoration of this, Norbert has been proclaimed the &quot;Apostle of Antwerp&quot;.

==Archbishop of Magdeburg==
In 1126 Pope Honorius II appointed Norbert to the Archbishopric of Magdeburg, where he put into practice the precepts he instituted at Prémontré. Several assassination attempts were made as he began to reform the lax discipline of his see. He was instrumental in protecting the Church&#x27;s rights against the secular power during the Investiture Controversy. 

In the schism following the election of Pope Innocent II in 1130, Norbert supported Innocent and resisted Antipope Anacletus II. In Norbert&#x27;s last years, he was chancellor and adviser to Lothair II, the Holy Roman Emperor, persuading him to lead an army in 1133 to Rome to restore Innocent to the papacy.

==Veneration==
When Norbert died in Magdeburg on 6 June 1134, both the canons at the cathedral and the canons at St. Mary&#x27;s Abbey claimed the body. The two parties resorted to Lothair III who decreed the body should be buried in the Norbertine Abbey. In 1524, Martin Luther preached in the city and, as a result, Magdeburg became a Protestant city. Numerous attempts were made over the centuries by the Abbey of Strahov in Prague to retrieve Norbert&#x27;s body. Only after several military defeats at the hand of Emperor Ferdinand II was the abbot of Strahov able to claim the body. On 2 May 1627 the body was finally brought to Prague where it remains to this day, displayed as an auto-icon in a glass-fronted tomb.

Norbert was canonized by Pope Gregory XIII in the year 1582, and his statue appears above the Piazza colonnade of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome.

==Legacy== 
Premonstratensian (or Norbertine) Canons in Europe, the US, Canada, the United Kingdom, South America, Zaire, South Africa, India and Australia are involved in education, parochial ministry, university chaplaincy also youth work. St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin, is the first institution of higher education to be founded by the Norbertine order. St. Norbert College also houses the Center for Norbertine Studies, a collaborative partnership between the college and the Premonstratensian order.

<text>Midnight Club II is a 2003 racing video game developed by Rockstar San Diego and published by Rockstar Games. It is the sequel to &quot;Midnight Club: Street Racing&quot;, published for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows and first in series to feature motorcycles. Players can race through cities such as Los Angeles, Paris, and Tokyo. It is the second game in &quot;Midnight Club&quot; franchise, followed by &quot;Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition&quot;.

==Gameplay==

Races (Career and Arcade) consist of a series of checkpoints, represented by columns of light. In most races, the order in which the checkpoints must be cleared is prescribed. In this case, a transparent, glowing arrow points to the next checkpoint. In a few other races, the checkpoints may be cleared in any order. In that case, the arrow spins randomly without pointing in any particular direction. It is up to the player which route to take from one checkpoint to the next. There are no artificial barriers in the game&#x27;s open world environment that force the player to stay on a specific course. Any area that is drivable or jumpable in the free-roaming cruise mode between races may be used to get to the next checkpoint.

Some areas can be driven upon that are not intended for such use outside of a computer game. Examples are escalators, roofs, railways and riverbeds and many ramps. However, many areas that would be drivable in reality, for example entrances and some stairs, are fenced off with invisible barriers. In some areas, the player can jump or drop down. Using this to the player&#x27;s advantage can be necessary in order to win a race. If the car falls into deep water, the damage meter goes to its maximum stage and the car is instantly totaled, the race being immediately lost.
Various details have been improved compared to its predecessor &quot;Midnight Club: Street Racing&quot;. Vehicles and cities have been developed from scratch, but many new features were added as well. 2-Wheel drive, Burnout, Weight Balance (for motorbikes) were all unique to the game. The game also features damage models. The amount of damage inflicted upon a car is indicated by both an HUD indicator and visual damage to the car. The performance of a car does not degrade with damage like some other racing games. When the damage limit of a car is exceeded, the car explodes or stalls. After a delay of a few seconds, the player can continue with an undamaged version of the same car.

Dry, hilly suburbs and congested interstates can be found throughout Los Angeles, and just like its predecessor, the city contains many landmarks, as well as numerous shortcuts and jumps. Paris is the home to cobblestone alleyways, monumental roundabouts, and the Paris Catacombs, as well as jumps across the river Seine and into alleyways. Tokyo is a city of neon-glittering avenues and tight alleyways, and contains an equal array of tourist sights and attractions.

The vehicles in &quot;Midnight Club II&quot; all resemble real-life vehicles but have subtle differences to their counterparts, such as different headlamps or tail lights. Also, most of them have aesthetical modifications commonly found in street racing and import scenes, such as spoilers, hood scoops, and body kits.

In the car selection menu, descriptions and stats of each vehicle can be seen, along with the option to choose among 4 colors. Once a car is viewed, a sound effect unique to that car is played in the background.
Each character will cruise around the city, waiting for a challenge. This excludes Moses, who helps the player begin the Career Mode, as well as the four champions who will seek the player out after all predecessors are beaten. They will talk to the player or &quot;think loudly&quot; during pre-race cut-scenes, during which the player can discover their motives, see the statistics of their vehicle, and learn each character&#x27;s unique theme song.

&quot;Midnight Club II&quot; also features an online multiplayer component. The Xbox version was supported through Xbox Live which was shut down on April 15, 2010. &quot;The game&quot; is now supported online with replacement online servers for the Xbox called Insignia.

==Development==
The game had a marketing budget of $6.1 million.

==Soundtrack==
The album was released at E3 in 2003 as a promotional gift. It consisted of mainly techno and trance music along with rap music. The soundtrack contains 38 tracks produced by various artists. The tracks &quot;Outrun&quot; and &quot;Extra Dry&quot; were featured from the 2002 film &quot;Irreversible&quot; and produced by Thomas Bangalter.

==Reception==

The game was met with positive reception. Metacritic gave it a score of 85 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version 86 out of 100 for the Xbox version, and 81 out of 100 for the PC version.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a B+ and stated that &quot;whether racing against the clock or attempting to beat the other drivers in checkpoint contests, memorizing the maps and finding the many shortcuts is crucial&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the PS2 version a score of eight out of ten and wrote that &quot;the only way [Rockstar] could make [the game] better would be to set it in Boston, where drunks get kicked out of the bars long after the T has shut down, flooding construction-choked highways&quot;. &quot;Maxim&quot; also gave the game a score of eight out of ten and said that &quot;it may not boast garages bloated with the usual name-brand chick magnets you find in other racing games, but the dark racing underbelly of &quot;Midnight Club II&quot; has every bit as many thrills as the leading grease monkey autopia&quot;. &quot;Playboy&quot; gave it 75% and noted its controls as &quot;touchy&quot; and imprecise.

<doc id="518211" wikidata="Q19035" url="?curid=518211" title="Cloaca">
<text>A cloaca ( ), : cloacae ( or ), or vent, is the rear orifice that serves as the only opening for the digestive (rectum), reproductive, and urinary tracts (if present) of many vertebrate animals. All amphibians, reptiles, birds, cartilaginous fish and a few mammals (monotremes, afrosoricids, and marsupial moles, etc.) have this orifice, from which they excrete both urine and feces; this is in contrast to most placental mammals, which have separate orifices for evacuation and reproduction. Excretory openings with analogous purpose in some invertebrates are also sometimes called cloacae. Mating through the cloaca is called cloacal copulation and cloacal kissing.

The cloacal region is also often associated with a secretory organ, the cloacal gland, which has been implicated in the scent-marking behavior of some reptiles, marsupials, amphibians, and monotremes.

== Etymology ==
The word is from the Latin verb &quot;cluo&quot;, &quot;(I) cleanse&quot;, thus the noun &quot;cloaca&quot;, &quot;sewer, drain&quot;.

==Birds==

Birds reproduce using their cloaca; this occurs during a cloacal kiss in most birds. Birds that mate using this method touch their cloacae together, in some species for only a few seconds, sufficient time for sperm to be transferred from the male to the female. For palaeognaths and waterfowl, the males do not use the cloaca for reproduction, but have a phallus.

One study has looked into birds that use their cloaca for cooling.

Among falconers, the word vent is also a verb meaning &quot;to defecate&quot;.

==Fish==
Among fish, a true cloaca is present only in elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) and lobe-finned fishes. In lampreys and in some ray-finned fishes, part of the cloaca remains in the adult to receive the urinary and reproductive ducts, although the anus always opens separately. In chimaeras and most teleosts, however, all three openings are entirely separated.

==Mammals==
With a few exceptions noted below, mammals have no cloaca. Even in the marsupials that have one, the cloaca is partially subdivided into separate regions for the anus and urethra.

===Monotremes===
The monotremes (egg-laying mammals) possess a true cloaca.

===Marsupials===

In marsupials, the genital tract is separate from the anus, but a trace of the original cloaca does remain externally. This is one of the features of marsupials (and monotremes) that suggest their basal nature, as the amniotes from which mammals evolved had a cloaca, and probably so did the earliest mammals.

Unlike other marsupials, marsupial moles have a true cloaca. This fact has been used to argue that they are not marsupials.

===Placentals===
Most adult placentals have no cloaca. In the embryo, the embryonic cloaca divides into a posterior region that becomes part of the anus, and an anterior region that develops depending on sex: in males, it forms the penile urethra, while in females, it develops into the vestibule or urogenital sinus that receives the urethra and vagina. However, some placentals retain a cloaca as adults: those are members of the order Afrosoricida (small mammals native to Africa) as well as pikas, beavers, and some shrews.

Being placental animals, humans have an embryonic cloaca which divides into separate tracts during the development of the urinary and reproductive organs. However, a few human congenital disorders result in persons being born with a cloaca, including persistent cloaca and sirenomelia (mermaid syndrome).

==Reptiles==
In reptiles, the cloaca consists of the &quot;urodeum&quot;, &quot;proctodeum&quot;, and &quot;coprodeum&quot;. Some species have modified cloacae for increased gas exchange (see reptile respiration and reptile reproduction). This is where reproductive activity occurs.

==Cloacal respiration in animals==
Some turtles, especially those specialized in diving, are highly reliant on cloacal respiration during dives. They accomplish this by having a pair of accessory air bladders connected to the cloaca, which can absorb oxygen from the water.

Sea cucumbers use cloacal respiration. The constant flow of water through it has allowed various fish, polychaete worms and even crabs to specialize to take advantage of it while living protected inside the cucumber. At night, many of these species emerge through the anus of the sea cucumber in search of food.

<doc id="518215" wikidata="Q1814666" url="?curid=518215" title="Jaywalking">
<text>Jaywalking is the act of pedestrians walking in or crossing a roadway if that act contravenes traffic regulations. The term originated in the United States as a derivation of the phrase &quot;jay-drivers&quot; (the word &quot;jay&quot; meaning &#x27;a , or rube&#x27;), people who drove horse-drawn carriages and automobiles on the wrong side of the road, before taking its current meaning. Jaywalking was coined as the automobile arrived in the street in the context of the conflict between pedestrian and automobiles (also then known as horseless carriages), more specifically the nascent automobile industry.

Jaywalking laws vary widely by jurisdiction. In many countries, the word is not generally used and, with the exception of certain high-speed roads such as motorways, there are no laws limiting how pedestrians are allowed to cross public highways. Thus, globally speaking, legal texts use different concepts, one of which is &quot;Rules applicable to pedestrians&quot;, put forward by the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. As an example of the subtleties and discrepancies of the laws governing pedestrian road traffic, even as a signing member of the Vienna convention, the United Kingdom does not have jaywalking laws: its Highway Code relies on the pedestrians making their own judgment on whether it is safe to cross based on the Green Cross Code.

==Origin of the term==

While jaywalking is associated with pedestrians today, the earliest references to &quot;jay&quot; behavior in the street were about horse-drawn carriages and automobiles in 1905 Kansas: &quot;jay drivers&quot; who did not drive on the correct side of the street. The term swiftly expanded to pedestrians, and by 1909, &quot;The Chanute Daily Tribune&quot; warned &quot;The jay walker needs attention as well as the jay driver, and is about as big a nuisance.&quot; No historical evidence supports an alternative folk etymology by which the word is traced to either the letter &quot;J&quot; (characterizing the route a jaywalker might follow), or &quot;jake walk&quot; (an early term related to a drunkard&#x27;s walk).

The automobile lobby in the US took up the cause of labeling and scorning jaywalkers in the 1910s and early 1920s. In 1912, for instance, &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; magazine reported that the term was current in Kansas City: &quot;The city pedestrian who cares not for traffic regulations at street corners, but strays all over the street, crossing in the middle of the block, or attempting to save time by choosing a diagonal route across a street intersection instead of adhering to the regular crossing, is designated as a &quot;jay walker,&quot; in Kansas City.&quot; The earliest citation in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates to 1917. The word was promoted by the pro-automobile lobby in the 1920s, according to historian and alternative transportation advocate Peter D. Norton. Today, in the US, the word is often used synonymously with its current legal definition, crossing the street illegally.

Originally in the US, the legal rule was that &quot;all persons have an equal right in the highway, and that in exercising the right each shall take due care not to injure other users of the way&quot;. In time, however, streets became the province of vehicular traffic, both practically and legally.

==Causes==

People jaywalk for various reasons, including convenience, the expectation of the right to free movement of individuals, and sometimes even personal safety, generally to cross the street. Going to a crosswalk can require a long detour.

Although cultural norms about jaywalking vary by locality, the practice cannot simply be explained by corresponding differences in law. For example, Copenhagen and New York City have historically had similar restrictions on jaywalking at signalised crosswalks, but the practice is far more common in New York.

Pedestrians are often forced to walk outside crosswalks, when they are blocked by cars due to traffic congestion or drivers stopping too far forward. The common practice of car-centric traffic-signal synchronisation produces green waves for motorists but not necessarily for pedestrians, who may encounter little or no conflicting traffic at cross streets where signals instruct them to wait.

Pedestrians may dislike crossing at intersections for other reasons, such as discomfort dealing with traffic from several directions (whereas a jaywalker at a location distant from an intersection only needs to observe at most two directions of traffic), or wanting to avoid the extra air emissions generated by vehicles stopping and starting (given that vehicular emissions are significantly less when vehicles are moving at steady speeds). In rural and suburban areas, people may jaywalk due to a lack of sidewalks. Some pedestrians are unwilling to observe lengthy wait times at signals. They are also more likely to make &quot;informal crossings&quot; at wide roads, or at locations where formal crosswalks are too distant to be practical for them to use.

Some crosswalk signals that require a pedestrian to push a button are unusable for orthodox Jews on the Shabbat.

==Safety==
Unsignalised marked crosswalks where drivers are more likely to yield to pedestrians are not necessarily safer than their unmarked counterparts, where pedestrians behave more cautiously, not expecting motorists to yield.

Many American newspapers publish stories that are critical of pedestrian road users&#x27; safety practices, while police departments often instigate education and enforcement campaigns to curb jaywalking. While nearly 60% of American pedestrian deaths occur outside of crosswalks, fewer than 20% occur in close proximity to a crosswalk.

== Legal view by jurisdiction ==
When used in the technical sense, jaywalking specifically refers to violation of pedestrian traffic regulations and laws and is therefore illegal. In many countries, such regulations do not exist and jaywalking is an unknown concept.

=== Africa ===
==== Zimbabwe ====
In Zimbabwe, jaywalking is illegal, according to the traffic laws gazetted in 2013 by the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure Development. Disregarding designated crossing points or passing through red traffic lights carries a punishment of up to six months in jail or a US$20 fine, as part of the new Highway Code. The code also deals with all road users; it used to emphasise rules for motorists and cyclists.

=== Asia ===
In many Asian countries, the low level of traffic control means that jaywalking is often more of a necessity to a pedestrian and is rarely punished except in major commercial hubs such as Singapore. In many countries like India and Vietnam, the amount of traffic and the lack of knowledge and obedience to traffic safety rules makes it common for pedestrians to walk out into oncoming traffic and effectively &quot;carve out&quot; a route to the other side of the road.

====Mainland China====

In recent years, jaywalking has become more strictly controlled in China as car traffic increased. Police have tested facial recognition to identify jaywalkers. The authorities applied a new method to deter jaywalkers by displaying their photo on large public screens in the area where the jaywalking occurred, to publicly shame any violator of pedestrian street rules. The system has flaws: the photo of the businesswoman Dong Mingzhu was displayed on those screens after the AI systems misinterpreted her appearance on a passing bus advertisement as a real person crossing the street in an illegal fashion.

==== Hong Kong ====
In Hong Kong, it is an offence to cross roads within the zigzag area around zebra crossings, or within 15 m of other crossing points (including signal-controlled crossings, footbridges and subways) without using the crossing, or climb over fences to cross the road. It is also an offence to cross the road at a signalled crossing when it is red.

====Israel====
Israeli transit regulations section 110 states a person shall not cross a road unless they have checked to make sure it is safe to do so. Where there is a &quot;nearby&quot; pedestrian crossing, a pedestrian shall not cross the road except at the pedestrian crossing. Where there isn&#x27;t one nearby but there&#x27;s a &quot;nearby&quot; intersection, the pedestrian shall cross &quot;near&quot; the intersection. In any case, the pedestrian shall cross at a reasonable speed and in the shortest straight line across the road, without spending undue time on the road.

Israeli courts have ruled that the legislature left the term &quot;nearby&quot; deliberately vague and it must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

==== South Korea ====
In Korea, it is illegal to cross the road outside of the crosswalk mark on a road with a crosswalk or to cross without following traffic lights on the crosswalk. On a crossing controlled by traffic light, pedestrians can cross only on green. Except for persons with physical disabilities, pedestrians must use the facilities to cross the roads with overpasses or underground sidewalks. Jaywalking is naturally prohibited on roads with pedestrian prohibition signs such as expressways.

The fine for jaywalking is 20,000 won.

However, pedestrians can cross a road which doesn&#x27;t have any crosswalk. They also cross the intersection and near part of intersections without traffic lights at the shortest distance. The standard for not having a crosswalk is usually 200 meters. In addition, on roads that do not have a distinction between center lines or lanes, pedestrians can occupy the entire road, walk and cross. This is entirely legal and pedestrians are legally protected from cars.

==== India ====
In India, jaywalking is not explicitly included in the law as an offence but is covered under the broader term &#x27;obstruction of traffic&#x27; in state and metropolitan laws. Examples include section 28B of the Delhi Police Act, 33B of the Bombay Police Act and 92G of the Karnataka Police Act. However, jaywalking is common in cities because of the lack of regulated crossings and footpaths, ignorance of safety rules, and the poor regulation of related laws by authorities. Drives against jaywalking are conducted by the police departments from time to time and offenders are given fines of 100 to 500 Indian rupees, depending upon the jurisdictions. Drivers must yield the right of way for pedestrians at unsignalled crossings and marked pedestrian crossings.

==== Iran ====
In Iran, crossing outside crossing points within 150 of one or if the pedestrian light is red, as well as starting to cross when the light is flashing, has been prohibited since the 1970s. If in an intersection there is no pedestrian light, traffic lights would be considered and so it is illegal when it is red or orange. As of November, 2009, jaywalking carries fines from 300,000 up to 2,000,000 rials (US$9 to US$60). The law has almost never been enforced.

====Kazakhstan====
In Kazakhstan, jaywalking is illegal and punishable by a fine. This is enforced on major streets in large cities. 

====Philippines====

In the Philippines, jaywalking is not illegal. The Land Transportation and Traffic Code, which was passed in 1964, states that within commercial or residential areas, drivers of vehicles must yield the right of way to pedestrians crossing public roads on pedestrian crossings, except when traffic movement is regulated by traffic enforcers. Likewise, pedestrians must yield their right of way to motor vehicles when crossing a public road at any point other than a pedestrian crossing. It is however, illegal to cross or traverse an expressway on foot based on the Revised Rules and Regulations Governing Limited Access Highways.

Local government units may explicitly prohibit jaywalking in their localities through local ordinances, such as Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Ordinance No. 1 series of 1995, which supplements city and municipal anti-jaywalking ordinances in Metro Manila on major roads.

In 2007, the Supreme Court of the Philippines exemplified Article 2179 of the Civil Code of the Philippines in the context of jaywalking, ruling that a pedestrian who is injured as a result of jaywalking may forfeit the right to recover damages if their own negligence contributed to the injury. Alternatively, the pedestrian may only recover partial damages if the vehicle driver is found to have contributory negligence.

====Singapore====

In Singapore, jaywalking (not using a traffic crossing while within 50m of it) is an offence. A fine of $50 is payable for the first offence. Repeat offenders can be charged $1000 and a jail term of 3 months, but the latter is rarely imposed. In 2011, 8,650 people were caught jaywalking and fined in Singapore. Between January and March 2012, Singapore prosecuted 1,758 for jaywalking, and between January and March 2013, 2,409 jaywalkers were fined.

===Europe===

In many European countries, pedestrians are banned from high speed roads such as motorways or expressways, but they are generally permitted on regular rural and urban roads. That is done in compliance with the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which also contains concepts addressing the question of the usage of the road or street by pedestrians for walking or crossing. Some countries like Ireland do not comply with the convention as rigorously as others. Laws and traditions vary from country to country.

Pedestrians account for 10% of motorway fatalities: 217 pedestrian fatalities on EU motorways in 2012 and 847 between 2010 and 2012. The rate is 20% in Poland, 17% in Great Britain, 15% in Spain and 10% in France. These include vehicle users who leave their vehicles after they have broken down, workers in work zones and individuals who illegally enter the motorway on foot.

==== Belgium ====
Pedestrians must use marked crossings within 20 m if the speed limit is above 30 km/h. However, any physical injury to a pedestrian caused by a traffic accident is compensated by the insurance of the drivers involved, regardless of the responsibility of the pedestrian, unless the pedestrian is over 14 and wanted the accident and its consequences to occur.

====Finland====
It is legal to cross all roads except motorways in Finland. Crossing a road must be done in a perpendicular direction, without undue delay, and must use a zebra crossing if one is nearby. Cars are required by law to give way to pedestrians at zebra crossings unless there is a traffic light.

====France====
Pedestrians are required to use sidewalks (if any), and zebra crossings for crossing a street if one is within 50 m; they must also
* cross at right angles to the road axis,
* only cross a &quot;place&quot; (including a market/town square in which motor vehicles are permitted) or any intersection on a formal crossing
* cross only at the green pedestrian light if in situ, and
* obey a police officer, if one regulates crossing.

More rules apply at night, on countryside roads, to groups of marching people, etc. Disregarding those rules may be punished by a fine of the lowest grade (&quot;contravention de première classe&quot;: 11 to 17€, or 33€ if paid late) but few people were ever fined for such behavior; any actual fines were usually because they showed contempt instead of apologising or providing some valid safety reason. On the other hand, drivers must always let pedestrians cross if they have already started or if they clearly demonstrate the intention to do so, even when the pedestrian is disregarding the rules, and will bear full responsibility if an accident occurs. These rules are often not respected; most pedestrians would cross anywhere (including at a red pedestrian light) when no car can be seen nearby on the road, but would not take the risk of trying to cross even on a zebra crossing when a car is coming, until it stops.

On French motorways, pedestrians are banned; in case of breakdown motorists are required to leave the car and walk away to safety, behind fences or lines marking the road boundaries, where no car can hit them. Nonetheless, some pedestrians are injured on motorways: in 2016, on the tolled motorway network:
* 16% of fatalities were pedestrians, an average of 23 pedestrian fatalities per year on the network.
* 69% of pedestrian motorway fatalities occurred on motorway lanes, 28% occurred on emergency lanes, and 3% in rest areas.
* injured pedestrians&#x27; presence on the motorway was due to breakdowns, stopping in emergency lanes (40%), accidents (28%), motorway staff (3%), providing assistance (2%), or other reasons (27%).

==== Germany ====
Pedestrians must follow rules when crossing the street. Even so, Section 1 of the Road Traffic Regulation ( [StVO]), the most important section, requires the road user not to endanger anybody. Car drivers must always be prepared to brake for pedestrians, especially for children and elderly people. On the other hand, pedestrians, according to Section 25 § 25, Abs. 3, StVO (VwV), must watch the vehicular traffic carefully and cross a street quickly and using the shortest way across the driving lanes.

Depending on the situation on the street, pedestrians may not cross the street except at intersections or within the markings of traffic signals or crosswalks. Pedestrians who cross the street at intersections or crossings must use existing traffic signals or crosswalks. Cars and bikes are required by law to give way to pedestrians (but not bicycle riders) at zebra crossings unless there is a traffic light. If one wants to cross the street outside the markings of traffic lights or crosswalks, one must carefully observe before and during the crossing that the road is clear, and wait before crossing if a vehicle approaches. A pedestrian may not interrupt the flow of traffic.

Although being within 15 meters is not considered &quot;at&quot; the crosswalk or traffic light, pedestrians may not cross the street within 30 meters of a crosswalk or 40 meters of a traffic light. During heavy traffic, pedestrians may not cross the street, as they might have to stop on a traffic lane. Typical fines for not using existing crosswalks or traffic lights in Germany are between 5€ and 10€.

==== Hungary ====
Whilst jaywalking is not specifically defined by the Hungarian Highway Code (KRESZ) as an offence, various restrictions and prohibitions apply for pedestrians crossing or walking along roads. Fines are applied at the discretion of the police of up to 30,000 forint for each offence, according to Section 21 (1-13) of the code. Pedestrians have the right of way on crosswalks and may cross the road at certain specified points such as at intersections if crosswalks are not available.

==== Ireland ====
Ireland maintains a jaywalking law, which requires a pedestrian to use a pedestrian crossing if they are within of one. When crossing a road, pedestrians are advised to wait until it is safe to cross. Vehicles should give way to the pedestrian who uses a zebra crossing. Irish children are taught the Road Safety Authority safe cross code in schools where it teaches them to stop, listen, and look out for any oncoming traffic whilst crossing a road and only cross a road if safe to do so. It also advises them to use traffic lights and zebra crossings to cross a road rather than jaywalk. The Garda Síochána usually do not take action on jaywalkers unless they caused possible harm to drivers or others.

==== Italy ====
Pedestrians are allowed to cross a street without any recognised crossing point only if there are no zebra crossings within a range of 100 m, but they should be careful anyway. If pedestrians cross a street at a crosswalk, drivers must yield.&lt;br&gt;
Walking on highways (&quot;autostrade&quot;) and main suburban roads (&quot;strade extraurbane principali&quot;) is always forbidden.

====Netherlands====
There is no concept of jaywalking in the Netherlands&#x27; traffic laws, so it is not an offence as such. Without zebra stripes, pedestrians must yield, but at a zebra, road traffic must slow down and yield as soon as pedestrians &quot;seem about to&quot; cross.

====Poland====
Jaywalking is an offence. One must cross only at recognised crossing points if there is one within 100 m (including pedestrian tunnels and footbridges). Otherwise, regular roads may be crossed with due care. Crossing dual carriageways (except motorways) is allowed only outside towns. Crossing tram and train tracks that are separate and parallel to street is always prohibited. Crossing on red lights is prohibited and considered to be an offence. According to regulations of &quot;Prawo o Ruchu Drogowym&quot; (Traffic Regulations Act) crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing is allowed only if it does not endanger traffic safety or obstruct traffic. The pedestrian is not obliged to give priority to vehicles and should follow the shortest line to the opposite edge of the road, perpendicular to the road axis. Crossing the track separated from the road is only allowed in designated locations.

====Portugal====
It is illegal to cross the road except when the nearest zebra crossing is more than 50 m away. Any crossing above that distance is legal. Pedestrians have priority over cars.

==== Romania ====
Jaywalking can be fined, but you are still permitted to cross the street on the corner of the street if no crosswalk exists but you don&#x27;t have priority over the cars.

==== Russia ====
Pedestrians must cross all roads at defined crossing points such as zebra crossings, pedestrian tunnels, footbridges, or unmarked crossings. Pedestrians are free to cross all roads without safety barriers, or a median if there is no crossing point in sight. Jaywalkers may be fined 500 rubles at the discretion of the police, or 1000-1500 rubles if intoxicated.

====Scandinavia====
It is legal to cross all roads except motorways in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. Cars and bikes are required by law to give way to pedestrians (but not bicycle riders) at zebra crossings unless there is a traffic light with a green light and it is green for the cars or bikes and no pedestrians are currently using the crossing. Pedestrians are encouraged to cross the road at zebra crossings if there is one nearby and are discouraged from crossing at a red light.

In Norway, a red man at the crossing is the signal for pedestrians not to begin crossing if it would impede cars or entail danger, but a person may walk across if there are no cars nearby. Risking oneself by running across in front of cars is not legal. Cyclists are required to stop at red lights, but because not everyone is aware of that, the Norwegian national cyclists&#x27; organisation has proposed to end confusion by prohibiting all people from crossing at red lights.

In Denmark, it is illegal to cross the road outside of a pedestrian crossing if one is nearby.

In Sweden, it is illegal, but not punishable, for a pedestrian to cross at a red light. However, if doing this causes a traffic accident, the pedestrian could be convicted of negligence in traffic.

====Serbia====
In Serbia, it is illegal to cross roads other than at pedestrian crossings if there is a zebra crossing within 100 m.

====Slovakia====
In Slovakia, it is illegal to cross roads other than at pedestrian crossings if there is a zebra crossing within , or for certain types of road. If not regulated by traffic lights, pedestrians have priority on pedestrian crossings over cars but not trams. However, pedestrians must wait for a safe moment to cross and so cars usually fail to stop if there are pedestrians around, unlike in other European countries where pedestrians may cross immediately.

====Slovenia====
In Slovenia, pedestrians must use zebra crossings and obey traffic signals. They may cross elsewhere only if the nearest zebra crossing is at least away and the lanes are not divided by a solid center line or median. Pedestrians have priority only at zebra crossings; elsewhere, vehicles are not required to yield. Violations are punishable by a fine of 40 euros.

====Switzerland====
In Switzerland, pedestrians are generally allowed to cross the street everywhere. They have priority on zebra crossings but should cross with care. However, they must use a pedestrian crossing, bridge or underpass if it is within 50 m. Certain types of roads must not be entered by pedestrians, such as highways and motorways. Failure to comply is subject to a fine of 20 Swiss Francs. Likewise, crossing or bypassing of closed railway gates is prohibited.

On motorways, fines may vary based on the situation. A driver driving at 100 km/h on a road with a 120 km/h speed limit, if the light visibility is 60 m and the braking distance is 65 m, may be fined for not noticing a person on the road. Even if that person is suicidal, as in a court case in 2017, that fact does not matter. A fine of 210 Swiss francs fine is cheaper than the court costs. However, such circumstances may also be considered to be exceptional and unpredictable.

==== United Kingdom ====
In England, Wales and Scotland (Great Britain) it is not illegal to cross or walk on all roads except motorways (where pedestrians and slow vehicles are not permitted), and roads with the &quot;No Pedestrians&quot; sign displayed. The Highway Code contains rules for crossing a road safely, but these are recommendations and not legally directly enforceable, though branches of the highway code may be used as supporting evidence in prosecutions. As with other advisory parts of the Highway Code, compliance and non-compliance can be used to claim/counterclaim/defend against liability in civil law claims such as insurance claims.

The term &quot;jaywalking&quot; can be obscure to those not exposed to American culture. There is no law preventing such an act. British citizens, like citizens from other countries where it is not an offence, are more prone to infringe jaywalking laws abroad. Transport for London identified tourists visiting London as being particularly vulnerable due to the personal assessment of risk expected of all pedestrians who cross roads. Some tourists copy locals&#x27; most risky crossing stunts, falsely assuming there was no advanced risk assessment involved or a higher right-of-way to vehicles, without understanding they have less right-of-way in all but a few places and times. A third reason is that many visitors are not used to all traffic driving on the left. Recent changes to the Highway Code have given priority to pedestrians waiting to cross a road.

A 2014 Yougov poll found 77% of Britons believed walking on roads when it is safe to do so should remain legal; 14% favored making it illegal. A similar US Yougov poll found 30% believed &quot;jaywalking&quot; should be legal—in most settlements, there is next to no centuries-old societal norm of specific roads on which it may in daytime be safe to walk, such as horse-frequented, cobbled or hump-calmed rural village.

When crossing, pedestrians are expected to use their judgement and wait until it is safe to cross. Under Rule 170 of the Highway Code, if a pedestrian is waiting to cross or has already started crossing the road (from either side) across a side street into which a car is about to turn, vehicles should always give way and let them leave the road safely. (Prior to January 2022 this only applied for pedestrians who had already started to cross the road). In UK schools children are taught to cross roads safely through the Green Cross Code. British children are taught to &quot;Stop, Look and Listen&quot; before crossing a road, as demonstrated in the &quot;Think!&quot; campaign.

Unlike the rest of the UK, in Northern Ireland jaywalking is an offence. This is through article 38 of the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1995, which states &quot;If a pedestrian through his own negligence on a road endangers his own safety, or that of any other person, he is guilty of an offence.&quot; In both 2005 and 2006, hundreds of fines were issued for jaywalking, however from 2018 onwards this had reduced to approximately 50 per year.

===North America===
====Canada====

Jaywalking is not in the Criminal Code and is not considered a criminal offence in Canada. No law on jaywalking exists at the federal level, although several provinces, territories, and municipalities have enacted regulations or by-laws that restrict when a pedestrian may cross a roadway. Enforcement of these provincial regulations and municipal by-laws remains extremely rare. 

Section 144 of Ontario&#x27;s &quot;Highway Traffic Act&quot; permits pedestrians to cross a roadway when they are not adjacent to a marked crosswalk and they yield to oncoming traffic, although the same section also requires them to use a marked crosswalk to cross the roadway when they are near one. Similar traffic regulations also exist in Quebec&#x27;s highway safety code, and Saskatchewan&#x27;s &quot;Traffic Safety Act&quot;. Most of these provincial regulations, in addition to municipal by-laws, do not use the term jaywalking to describe when a pedestrian unlawfully crosses a roadway.

As a result of differing provincial/territorial regulations and/or municipal by-laws, the fine that is charged for crossing a motorway varies across the country, from C$30 in Quebec, to C$697.50 in Nova Scotia. In Ontario, motorway crossing related fines are typically charged under section 144 of the &quot;Highway Traffic Act&quot;, or a municipal by-law, with an average fine of C$35; although the maximum fine a pedestrian can be charged under the Ontario&#x27;s &quot;Highway Traffic Act&quot; is C$50.

====Mexico====
Jaywalking is not illegal in Mexico. However, on the Paseo de la Reforma, one of Mexico City&#x27;s longest and most important avenues, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, then the city&#x27;s mayor, commissioned the installation of concrete prisms along the avenue&#x27;s central crrb, to discourage pedestrians from crossing the road.

==== United States ====
State road rules in the United States usually require a driver to yield the right of way to a pedestrian crossing a road when the pedestrian crosses at a marked crosswalk or an unmarked crosswalk. Unmarked crosswalks generally exist as the logical extensions of sidewalks at intersections with approximately right angles. Following the Uniform Vehicle Code, state codes often do not prohibit a pedestrian from crossing a roadway between intersections if at least one of the two adjacent intersections is not controlled by a signal, but they stipulate that a pedestrian not at a crosswalk must yield the right of way to approaching drivers. State codes often permit pedestrians to use roads that are not controlled access facilities and without sidewalks but such use is usually regulated. For example, in Florida they must keep to the shoulder of the leftmost side of the road and yield to any oncoming traffic.

State codes may include provisions that allow local authorities to prohibit pedestrian crossing at locations outside crosswalks, but since municipal pedestrian ordinances are often not well known to drivers or pedestrians and can vary from place to place in a metropolitan area that contains many municipalities, obtaining compliance with local prohibitions of pedestrian crossings much more restrictive than statewide pedestrian regulations can be difficult. Signs, fences, and barriers of various types (including planted hedges) have been used to prohibit and prevent pedestrian crossing at some locations. If the detour to a legal crossing would be highly inconvenient, even fences are sometimes not effective. Street design, traffic design, and locations of major building entrances that make crosswalks the most logical and practical locations to cross streets are usually more effective than police enforcement to reduce illegal or reckless pedestrian crossings.

At a signaled crossing, a pedestrian is subject to the applicable pedestrian traffic signal or, if no pedestrian signal is displayed, the signal indications for the parallel vehicular movement. A pedestrian signal permits a pedestrian to begin crossing a street during the &quot;Walk&quot; display; pedestrians are usually considered to be &quot;jaywalking&quot; only if they enter the crosswalk some other time. The meanings of pedestrian signal indications are summarised in Section 4E.02 of the national Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

Jaywalking is considered an infraction, but in some jurisdictions, it is a misdemeanor or requires a court appearance. The penalty is usually a fine. In some cities, such as New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Boston, although prohibited, &quot;jaywalking&quot; has been so common that police generally cite or detain jaywalkers only if their behavior is considered excessively dangerous or disruptive, such as running out in front of a moving vehicle or crossing after the light is about to change to allow cross traffic to proceed. Penalties for jaywalking vary by state, and, within a state, may vary by county or municipality. A sampling of US cities found fines ranging from $1 to $1,000.

In May 2017, a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reporter spent the day attempting to get a $1 citation for jaywalking in downtown traffic. The reporter walked against lights, crossed in the middle of streets, and across the middle of blocks and did not receive a ticket, even when committing infractions in front of police officers.

Jaywalking at a signalised intersection may carry higher fines in some jurisdictions for disobeying the signalised controls. Many jurisdictions have a separate law defining the difference between jaywalking, or &quot;disobedience of traffic signal controls.&quot; Some jurisdictions may fine pedestrians up to the same amount as a vehicle running a red light, but no driving points are issued, as the pedestrian was not driving at the time.

=====California=====
On 30 September 2022, California governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill decriminalizing jaywalking in the state of California. The bill, 2022 AB-2147, known as The Freedom to Walk Act, was initially introduced by Assembly member Phil Ting (D-19). It bars law enforcement from stopping and citing a pedestrian for &quot;safe mid-block crossings&quot; except in the circumstances where &quot;a reasonably careful person would realize there is an immediate danger of a collision&quot;. This bill amended Section 21955 of the California Vehicle Code to include this provision. It also states that it does not relieve a pedestrian from the duty of using due care for his or her safety.

=====Safety considerations=====
In the United States, jaywalking is linked to pedestrian injuries and fatalities,
but no available data provide an exact risk rate because of missing jaywalking frequency data.

In the United States, jaywalking is mainly an urban issue (71%), but it can also be a suburban or rural issue when no pavement is available.

In the United States, jaywalking might be understood as:
* walking against a pedestrian walk signal,
* crossing a street where there is no crosswalk (midblock crossing),
* crossing a street outside of a marked crosswalk where one is present, and
* walking on a street along with the traffic flow (ignoring designated pedestrian pathways).

However other pedestrian behavior might be considered as unsafe while not qualified of jaywalking, for instance, failure of drivers to yield for pedestrians, jogging/walking in the wrong direction, working on a parked car, leaning on a parked car, pushing a disabled car, standing between parked cars, and standing in a road.

Some pedestrian factors that lead to a jaywalking behavior were found to be pedestrian perceptions of risk, consumption of alcohol, perceptions of crossing devices, speed and pace of life, speed versus crossing-device speed, perceptions of enforcement risk, unawareness of pedestrian laws and safety, following the leader.

Some known environmental factors include absence of midblock crosswalks, width of roads, poor timing of crossing signals, poor conditions of sidewalks, absence of sidewalks in certain areas, capacity of sidewalks, weather, people with limited mobility, people with occupational risks, children and teens, parking areas near shopping centers, street repair and construction sites, major highways, one-way streets, location of attractions, and unlawful street-vending.

=====Racial bias=====

In California, differences by race in charging of pedestrians for jaywalking has led to assertions of racial bias and proposals to end considering jaywalking to be an offense.

California Assembly member Phil Ting proposed decriminalizing jaywalking. The bill, AB 2147, The Freedom To Walk Act, passed by the legislature and signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, took effect on January 1, 2023.

Seattle City Council members Bruce Harrell and Lorena González raised issues of bias in jaywalking tickets in that city as well.

===Oceania===
==== Australia ====
In Australia, it is illegal to start crossing the road at an intersection if a pedestrian light is red or flashing red. If no such pedestrian light exists, the traffic lights are used, making it illegal to proceed on red or orange. Furthermore, it is illegal to cross any road within 20 m of an intersection with pedestrian lights or within 20 m of any pedestrian crossing (including a zebra crossing, school crossing, or any other pedestrian crossing).

However, laws against jaywalking are rarely enforced, with the exception of the occasional police &quot;blitz&quot; on jaywalking for a week or so at a time, when the laws are enforced more stringently. Some roads with a record of pedestrian accidents feature fences in the center to discourage pedestrians, but there is no law against crossing them. States set their own fines for jaywalking. The fine in Victoria is 2 penalty units. The fine is $50 in Western Australia.

==== New Zealand ====
Pedestrians in New Zealand must, if possible, cross at right angles to the curb or side of the roadway unless they use pedestrian crossings or school crossing points. Pedestrians must use a pedestrian crossing, footbridge, underpass or traffic signal within 20 m. At intersections controlled by signals, pedestrians should wait for the green man to display and may not begin crossing when the static or the flashing red man is displayed. The fine for jaywalking is up to $35.

=== South America ===
==== Argentina ====
In Argentina, jaywalking is legal.
==== Brazil ====
In Brazil, it is illegal to cross the road if the nearest zebra crossing is within 50 m. Pedestrians have priority over cars. According to CONTRAN resolution 706/17 from April 25, 2018, violators could pay a fine up to 44.19 Brazilian reals; however, the measure is rarely enforced.

<doc id="518228" wikidata="Q4944072" url="?curid=518228" title="Bootsauce">
<text>Bootsauce was a Canadian rock band based in Montreal. The band was composed of Drew Ling (real name Drew Thorpe) (vocals), Pere Fume (real name Perry Johnson) (guitar), Sonny Greenwich Jr. (guitar), Alan Baculis (bass guitar), and John &quot;Fatboy&quot; Lalley (drums). Their style combined soul, funk and metal sounds. Two of their albums, &quot;The Brown Album&quot; and &quot;Bull&quot; achieved Gold status in Canada. Their style was sometimes compared favorably to the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

==History==
Bootsauce was founded in 1989 in Montreal. The band was nominated for a Juno Award as Most Promising Group in 1991, and received a Juno in 1992 for their 1991 single &quot;Everyone&#x27;s a Winner&quot;, a Hot Chocolate cover. Their songs were played on MuchMusic.

In 1992, Bootsauce was part of the cross-Canada Big, Bad &amp; Groovy tour organized by MCA Concerts, along with Art Bergman. That year they released an album, &quot;Bull&quot; on the band&#x27;s own label. In 1993, the band released the album &quot;Sleeping Bootie&quot;. The song &quot;Sorry Whole&quot; was released as a single and reached #1 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Cancon chart. Touring for the Sleeping Bootie album, Bootsauce played the Commodore Ballroom in Vancouver for the first time on February 4th 1994.

<text>Ellis O&#x27;Neal Knox (1898–1975) was the first African American to be awarded a PhD in California. Knox received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1922 from the University of California, Berkeley and his doctorate in the history and philosophy of education from the University of Southern California in the 1931.

==Biography==
Knox was born in Northern California on July 6, 1898. The son of a Latin teacher, Albert P. Knox, and homemaker, Addie Knox, Ellis always had a love of education. As a young boy in the public schools of Lake County, California at the turn of the century, Ellis, the only black student in his classroom, excelled.

In 1923, shortly after graduation from UC Berkeley, Knox accepted a position on the staff of Phoenix Union High School. Soon he met his wife Lois Wynne. The couple moved to Los Angeles in 1926, where Knox began his studies at USC.

With his doctorate in hand, Knox moved to the District of Columbia to accept a position on the staff of Howard University in 1931. (In the 1940s and 1950s, Knox served as an adjunct professor at the American University, an adjunct lecturer at Yale University, and as a member of the Evaluation Committee of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, while retaining full professor status at Howard.)

By 1955, Knox was appointed to the President&#x27;s White House Conference on Education. A decade later, he began work as a consultant to both the Peace Corps and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. In the tradition of his philosophical and academic focus of promoting civil rights in education, Knox worked alongside Thurgood Marshall in the campaign that led to the desegregation of the schools in the District of Columbia and also served as the Chairman of Education for the NAACP from 1945 to 1962.

In 1967, Knox ended his tenure at Howard University and retired in Los Angeles, where he served as Professor Emeritus at the University of Southern California and the University of California Los Angeles until his death in 1975.

During his lifetime, Knox published several studies on the philosophy of education. His PhD dissertation dealt with the trend of philosophical doctrines in their relation to African-American youth in the United States. Knox was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, and was one of the founders of Alpha Epsilon chapter at the University of California, Berkeley.

<text>The Daniels &amp; Fisher Tower is a distinctive historic landmark located in Denver, Colorado.

== Description and history ==

Built as part of the Daniels &amp; Fisher department store in 1910, it was the tallest building between the Mississippi River and the state of California at the time of construction, at a height of 325 feet (99 m). The building was designed by the architect Frederick Sterner and modeled after The Campanile (St. Mark&#x27;s Bell Tower) at the Piazza San Marco in Venice, Italy. The 20-floor clock tower has clock faces on all four sides. May Company purchased Daniels &amp; Fisher in 1958, and the store vacated the tower. When the store was demolished (ca. 1971), the tower was saved and renovated into residential and office space in 1981. A 2½ ton bell occupies the top two floors of the building, above the observation deck.

The tower is located within Denver&#x27;s &quot;Skyline Park&quot; and the basement level has been home to the &quot;Clocktower Cabaret&quot; entertainment venue since 2006.

The tower was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 3, 1969.

<doc id="518249" wikidata="Q7874904" url="?curid=518249" title="USS Tuna (SS-203)">
<text>USS &quot;Tuna&quot; (SS-203) was a United States Navy , serving in the Pacific during World War II and earning seven battle stars for her service. After the war, she participated in the Bikini Atoll atomic testing in 1946.

&quot;Tuna&quot; was the second ship of the U.S. Navy to be named for the tuna, a vigorous, spiny-finned fish highly esteemed for sport and food.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Tuna&quot;&#x27;s keel was laid down on 19 July 1939 by the Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California. She was launched on 2 October 1940, sponsored by Mrs. Wilhelm L. Friedell, and commissioned on 2 January 1941.

==Pre-World War II==

&quot;Tuna&quot; departed San Diego, California, on 19 May 1941 for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and shakedown training. Operations in Hawaiian waters revealed that her torpedo tubes were misaligned. This problem necessitated her returning to the Mare Island Navy Yard for repairs.

==Wartime operations==
During the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, &quot;Tuna&quot; lay in drydock at Mare Island. She set out for Pearl Harbor on 7 January 1942.

===Initial patrols===
The first of &quot;Tuna&quot;’s 13 war patrols lasted from 26 January to 21 March 1942, as she roved the waters of the East China Sea. On 4 March off Kyūshū, sank one enemy freighter of about 6,000 tons, damaged and probably sunk one enemy destroyer, and damaged two other ships of undetermined type of about 2,000 tons each.

Standing out of Pearl Harbor on 14 April, &quot;Tuna&quot; once again set her course towards the Japanese home islands and the hunting off Honshū. She added another score to her tally by sinking the 805-ton cargo ship &quot;Toyohara Maru&quot; on 15 May before returning to Pearl Harbor on 16 June.

Following refit, &quot;Tuna&quot; became Task Unit 8.5.12, with orders to proceed to the Aleutian Islands. This third war patrol commenced on 13 July, but her only contact with the Japanese came on 9 August, when &quot;Tuna&quot; sighted a Japanese I-boat on the surface. She lost it shortly thereafter in heavy weather. Later in the month, she supported the Army occupation of Adak Island by transporting a colonel and six enlisted men from Dutch Harbor, Alaska, to Kuluk Bay between 25 August and 27 August. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 5 September.

===Patrolling New Guinea waters===
After routine overhaul, &quot;Tuna&quot; set out from Pearl Harbor on 9 November. She made only one contact during her fourth war patrol, firing two torpedoes at a Japanese destroyer operating off New Georgia Island on 12 December. Both missed their mark. Three days after Christmas 1942, &quot;Tuna&quot; arrived at her new base, Brisbane, Australia.

Setting out again on 18 January 1943 to begin patrol number five, she arrived in waters off the east coast of Vella LaVella six days later. Expending 16 torpedoes in five futile daylight attacks, &quot;Tuna&quot; pressed home determined forays only to be driven deep by intense enemy antisubmarine countermeasures. Kept on station between New Ireland and Buka after 11 February, &quot;Tuna&quot; launched further attacks – but from excessive ranges – which only resulted in still more frustration for her crew. Dispatched next to interdict traffic from reinforcing Vila Plantation and Munda, &quot;Tuna&quot; remained luckless and was forced deep and endured depth-charge attacks before ending the patrol on 7 February.

After refitting at Brisbane, &quot;Tuna&quot; set out on her sixth war patrol on 4 March to take up a position in the Bismarck Archipelago, off Lyra Reef, on the northeast side of New Ireland. En route, she patrolled west of Bougainville. On 16 March, she received orders to shift her position to a point southeast of a line between Mussau Island and Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands. Late in the afternoon of 29 March, she sighted a convoy of four merchantmen, with two escort ships and two aircraft. After stalking the convoy all night, &quot;Tuna&quot; attacked the following morning, firing three torpedoes at the largest vessel. Two hits, and the 4697-ton &quot;Kurohime Maru&quot; plunged to the bottom.

On 4 April, &quot;Tuna&quot; changed patrol zones, prowling now to the northwest of the Manus-Mussau line in the East Caroline Basin on the traffic lanes to Rabaul. After no further attack opportunities developed, &quot;Tuna&quot; returned to Brisbane on 20 April.

On 19 May, en route to her war patrol station for the seventh patrol, &quot;Tuna&quot; came under attack by a Japanese submarine which fired one torpedo at the American ship before breaking off the attack. After that brush with destruction, &quot;Tuna&quot; prepared to bombard Wakde Island with her deck guns, but the presence of Japanese subchasers forced a change in plans.

===Friendly fire===
On 29 July 1943, as &quot;Tuna&quot; set out from Brisbane on her eighth patrol, a Royal Australian Air Force Catalina flying boat patrol bomber attacked her, dropping four depth charges close aboard while &quot;Tuna&quot; was in the Solomon Sea east-northeast of Kiriwina Island and north of Woodlark Island at . After &quot;Tuna&quot; crash-dived, the depth charges exploded as she passed a depth between and , and she plunged to a depth of before her crew regained control of her. She surfaced with a port list of 18 degrees. The damage she sustained necessitated 17 days of major repairs at Brisbane, delaying her departure for her eighth war patrol until 21 August. Once on station for that patrol, two attack opportunities presented themselves, but neither one bore fruit.

Arriving back at Fremantle on 14 October, &quot;Tuna&quot; refitted alongside submarine tender before proceeding on her ninth patrol which commenced on 7 November. After transiting the Molucca Strait, &quot;Tuna&quot; prowled in the Java Sea and Flores Sea. Attacking a freighter in a rain squall on 21 November, &quot;Tuna&quot; launched four torpedoes, but only one hit the enemy merchantman. On 12 December, the submarine had better luck. The 5484-ton cargo ship &quot;Tosei Maru&quot; fell victim to her torpedoes, becoming the largest kill in &quot;Tuna&quot;’s war career to date.

Following her ninth patrol, &quot;Tuna&quot; proceeded across the Pacific to Hunters Point Navy Yard in California, where she arrived on 6 April 1944 for a major overhaul. After refitting, she returned to Hawaii to begin her tenth war patrol. Departing Pearl Harbor on 24 April, she surveilled the Palau Islands.

===The &quot;Takima Maru&quot;===
On 4 May 1944, &quot;Tuna&quot; sighted a 100-ton trawler. Bound for Wake Island with classified documents on board, &quot;Takima Maru&quot; put up a fight when taken under fire by the submarine&#x27;s two 20-millimeter guns. In the face of the returned fire, &quot;Tuna&quot; opened up with her three-inch deck gun and scored a hit on the first salvo, holing &quot;Takima Maru&quot; near the stern. Ten minutes later, the trawler settled beneath the waves, stern first, leaving the waters littered with secret papers and the surviving Japanese.

Meanwhile, submarine arrived on the scene and assisted in the pickup of confidential documents and prisoners. Each submarine picked up 30 documents; &quot;Tuna&quot; fished out three prisoners, one of whom died later. The two remaining prisoners were transferred to &quot;Haddock&quot;. &quot;Tuna&quot; lost her senior enlisted man, the Chief of the Boat, who was swept overboard and drowned while recovering material from the sea.

Ten days later, &quot;Tuna&quot; bombarded the phosphate works on Fais Island with 24 rounds from her deck gun. After the remainder of her patrol proved fruitless, the submarine returned to the Marshall Islands arriving at Majuro Atoll on 21 June.

===Final war patrols===
After commencing her 11th patrol upon departing Majuro Atoll on 15 July 1944, &quot;Tuna&quot; roamed the sea lanes of the Japanese home islands, off Shikoku and Kyūshū. Her radar picked up tempting targets, but bad luck continued to dog the ship&#x27;s efforts to make contact and launch attacks. On occasion, the superior surface speed of the hunted enabled it to easily outrun the hunter, and good antisubmarine measures by the Japanese escort ships forced &quot;Tuna&quot; to proceed cautiously. On 5 September, she arrived at Pearl Harbor empty-handed.

Following refit, &quot;Tuna&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 8 October, bound for the western Pacific. In conjunction with Operation &quot;King Two,&quot; the invasion and liberation of the Philippines, &quot;Tuna&quot; operated in a wolf pack, &quot;Roach&#x27;s Raiders,&quot; in company with &quot;Haddock&quot; and . During this 12th patrol, &quot;Tuna&quot; contacted seven ships; but made only one unsuccessful attack before arriving at Saipan on 2 December.

&quot;Tuna&quot;’s final war patrol began on 6 January as she left Saipan to take position off the west coast of Borneo. From 28 January to 30 January 1945, &quot;Tuna&quot; conducted a special mission, reconnoitering the northeast coast of Borneo. She did not attempt a landing due to enemy activity. From 2 March to 4 March, &quot;Tuna&quot; accomplished her second special mission of the patrol, landing personnel and of stores near Labuk Bay. During the patrol, she sighted no contacts deemed worthy of torpedo fire, and &quot;Tuna&quot; returned to Fremantle on 13 March 1945.

==Post-war assignments==
Thereafter, based at Fremantle, &quot;Tuna&quot; operated on training duty until she sailed for Leyte in the Philippines on 13 April. The submarine touched at Subic Bay and Saipan before returning to Pearl Harbor on 5 September. From there, she proceeded to San Francisco, California, arriving on 14 September.

After moving through the Panama Canal to the East Coast, &quot;Tuna&quot; remained in commission, in the inactive fleet, to assist in the maintenance and security of other submarines sent to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for tests. In this capacity, she served with Submarine Division 162, Submarine Squadron 16, Inactive Fleet, New London Group, until she was selected as a target vessel for the upcoming atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands.

==Atomic testing==
After once again transiting the Panama Canal, &quot;Tuna&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 2 March 1946 and reported for duty with Commander, Joint Task Force 1. In company with submarines , , and , &quot;Tuna&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 21 May 1946.

Upon her arrival at Bikini Atoll, nine days later, &quot;Tuna&quot; was assigned a place among the target vessels anchored in the atoll. The first atomic bomb was detonated on 1 July 1946, and the second followed 24 days later. Receiving only superficial damage, &quot;Tuna&quot; departed for Kwajalein on 22 August 1946 en route to Pearl Harbor and the West Coast. On 5 September, she arrived in Hawaiian waters, mooring at the submarine base.

==Decommissioning==
Underway for the United States West Coast on 7 October 1946, &quot;Tuna&quot; arrived at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard a week later where she moored with the 19th Fleet. Scheduled for decommissioning on 11 December 1946, she was retained as a radiological laboratory unit and subjected to numerous radiological and structural studies while remaining at Mare Island. No preservation work was undertaken on the ship, and she was decommissioned on 11 December 1946. On 20 September 1948, fleet ocean tug towed &quot;Tuna&quot; from Mare Island for the submarine&#x27;s &quot;last patrol.&quot; On 24 September 1948, &quot;Tuna&quot; was sunk in of water in the Pacific Ocean off the U.S. West Coast. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 21 October 1948.

<doc id="518251" wikidata="Q7869576" url="?curid=518251" title="USS Gar">
<text>USS &quot;Gar&quot; (SS-206) was the first of the &quot;Gar&quot; subclass of the &quot;Tambor&quot;-class submarines to be commissioned for the United States Navy just prior to the country&#x27;s 7 December 1941 entry into World War II. These submarines were a slightly improved version of preceding submarines of the &quot;Tambor&quot; class. While &quot;Gar&quot; survived the war, all of her sister ships — , &#x27;, , , and — were lost. She is the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the gar, a fish of the family Lepisosteidae.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Gar&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 7 November 1940, sponsored by Mrs. Leila P. Pettengill, wife of Rear Admiral George T. Pettengill, and commissioned at New London, Connecticut, on 14 April 1941.

==Depth charge tests and other operations, April 1941–January 1942==
&quot;Gar&quot; conducted shakedown training along the New England seaboard from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and New London, Connecticut.

During 1941, &quot;Gar&quot;, along with the submarines and , was used as a target in the study of the effectiveness of depth charges. She submerged to periscope depth and was subjected to explosions of of TNT set at various distances from her. The data these tests generated influenced the design of shock proofing in later submarines.

&quot;Gar&quot; departed New London on 24 November and transited the Panama Canal on 3 December 1941 en route to San Diego, California, where she arrived on 10 December 1941, three days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into World War II. She prepared for combat in the Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Mare Island, California, then departed San Francisco, California, on 15 January 1942 bound for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

==First war patrol==
&quot;Gar&quot;&#x27;s maiden patrol, from 2 February to 28 March 1942, was conducted around Nagoya and the Kii Channel entrance to the Inland Sea of Japan. She torpedoed and sank the Japanese 1,520-gross register ton cargo ship &quot;Chichibu Maru&quot; on 13 March 1942.

==Second, third, and fourth war patrols==
During her second war patrol, from 19 April to 8 June, she fired on a freighter off Kwajalein atoll, which her commanding officer believed was hit, but the ship did not sink. West of Truk Lagoon, she fired on a supposed Q-ship, which was not one in fact. &quot;Gar&quot; terminated her patrol at Fremantle, Australia. No sinkings were confirmed by JANAC postwar.

Her third war patrol, from 3 July to 21 August, took her to the South China Sea and the Gulf of Siam, where her only contact was a hospital ship. Her fourth war patrol, from 17 September to 7 November, took her to the northernmost waters in the Gulf of Siam, where on 19 October she laid 32 mines in the entrances to Bangkok. This was one of the strategic plants covering important Japanese shipping lanes previously patrolled by American submarines. Both patrols produced few contacts, thanks to timid patrolling, and no sinkings. &quot;Gar&quot;″ executive officer and third officer both requested transfers on her return, while her commanding officer received a &quot;blistering&quot; endorsement from his squadron commander and was relieved.

==Fifth, sixth, and seventh war patrols==

&quot;Gar&quot;″s fifth, sixth and seventh war patrols were conducted largely in approaches to Manila, Philippine Islands, via Borneo. During her fifth, from 28 November to 19 January 1943, she drove freighter &quot;Heinan Maru&quot; onto the beach with six torpedo hits and scored hits on a seaplane tender. (&quot;Gar&quot; was credited with one ship of 600 tons by JANAC postwar.) Her sixth, from 9 February to 2 April, brought numerous contacts with targets which could not be closed to firing range because of vigilant enemy aircraft and antisubmarine patrol ships. During her seventh war patrol, from 23 April to 27 May 1943 off Manila, she sank five small craft with gunfire; torpedoed and sank the 703-ton Japanese freighter/converted gunboat south of the Negros Islands on 9 May, then six days later attacked a convoy west of Mindoro, sinking the 3197-ton passenger-cargo ship &quot;Meikai Maru&quot; and the 4361-ton &quot;Indus Maru&quot;.

Captain Philip D. Quirk served on numerous ships and submarines in World War II and was also the commanding officer on following the outbreak of the Korean War. Quirk was awarded six Bronze Star Medals. As commanding officer of , his first award was for assisting in the rescue of RM1/c George R. Tweed from the Japanese-held island of Guam. Tweed had been marooned there since the Japanese invasion, and later wrote a book about his adventures titled &quot;Robinson Crusoe, USN&quot;. Quirk then commanded , before transferring to the Submarine Service and assuming command of USS &quot;Gar&quot;. He was awarded his fifth Bronze Star Medal in 1946 for &quot;Gar&quot;″s fifth patrol. Quirk was awarded the Silver Star for the seventh patrol, which sank three Japanese ships totaling 8000 tons.

Quirk complained loudly about the Navy&#x27;s faulty torpedoes, and was assigned to shore duty in July 1943. This scandal was soon proven all too true and corrected. Quirk was restored to grace, but transferred back to destroyer commands.

==Eighth and ninth war patrols==
Her eighth war patrol, from 18 June to 23 July, was spent patrolling the Flores Sea, where she torpedoed a 500-ton motorship which ran itself aground, the crew escaping into the jungle. (&quot;Gar&quot; was not given credit for it by JANAC.) En route from Fremantle to Pearl Harbor on her ninth war patrol, from 8 August to 13 September, &quot;Gar&quot; scouted off Timor and scored hits on a freighter in Makassar Strait. She then went in for overhaul and modernization in the Mare Island Navy Yard.

&quot;Gar&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor 30 November 1943, now in the hands of George W. Lautrup, Jr. (class of 1934), to resume combat duty in the Pacific, based out of Fremantle. Her ninth patrol saw her credited with one ship of 4,000 tons (reduced to 1,000 tons in the postwar accounting).

==Tenth through thirteenth war patrols==
Her tenth war patrol, out of Fremantle from 16 December 1943 to 9 February 1944, was conducted off Palau, where on 20 January she sank the 5325-ton cargo ship &quot;Koyu Maru&quot;; damaged two ships of another convoy on 22 January; then attacked a third convoy the following day and sank the 3670-ton &quot;Taian Maru&quot;. She then returned to Pearl Harbor.

Her 11th war patrol, from 3 March to 21 April, found her performing lifeguard duty for aviators making the first carrier-based air strikes on Palau. She saved eight aviators, one less than two miles (3 km) off the beach and within range of enemy gun emplacements.

Her 12th patrol, from 20 May to 5 July, was spent in the Bonin Islands area, where she made gunfire attacks on a convoy of Japanese sea trucks, leaving a small freighter raging in flames and dead in the water.

Her 13th patrol (now commanded by Maurice Ferrara, the first officer of the United States Naval Academy Class of 1937 to be given a submarine command), lasted from 14 August to 9 October and was largely taken up with lifeguard duty off Yap, supporting the combined fleet-shore operations that captured the Palau Islands. She also performed reconnaissance duty off Surigao Strait. She bombarded installations on Yap from 6 to 8 September and ended her patrol at Brisbane, Australia.

==Fourteenth and fifteenth war patrols==
On her 14th war patrol, from 3 to 30 November, &quot;Gar&quot; landed 16 men and 25 tons of supplies at San Esteban, Ilocos Sur, Luzon, Philippine Islands, on 23 November and picked up intelligence documents. On 27 November 1944, an Allied PBY Catalina mistook her for a Japanese submarine and attacked her in the Celebes Sea southeast of the Sibutu Passage at . &quot;Gar&quot; crash-dived to a depth of and heard three bombs explode, none of them close. She terminated her patrol in the lagoon at Mios Woendi in the Schouten Islands.

On her 15th and final war patrol, from 4 to 27 December, she landed 35 tons of supplies on the west coast of Luzon, near Darigayos Inlet on 11 December, returning to Pearl Harbor with urgent intelligence documents including maps locating enemy gun emplacements, beach defenses, troop concentrations, and fuel and ammunition dumps on Luzon. Some of those supplies and personnel made their way to Donald Blackburn&#x27;s guerrilla force.

==End of World War II and fate==
After overhaul in the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, &quot;Gar&quot; put to sea 2 April 1945 to serve the remainder of the war as a target trainer for antisubmarine ships at Saipan and Guam, Marianas Islands. She departed Apra Harbor, Guam, on 7 August 1945, proceeding via Hawaii, San Francisco, California, and the Panama Canal to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, where she arrived 20 October.

She decommissioned there 11 December 1945 and remained in reserve until September 1948, when she began an overhaul in the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard which lasted until through October. She was then transferred as a United States Naval Reserve training submarine for the 4th Naval District at Cleveland, Ohio, arriving there via the Mississippi River and the Chicago Canal on 28 November 1948. She continued her reserve training until her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 29 May 1959. She was sold for scrapping 18 November 1959 to Acme Scrap Iron and Metal Company.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Gar&quot; received 11 battle stars for service in World War II.

<text>USS &quot;Tambor&quot; (SS-198), the lead ship of her class of submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tambor.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Tambor&quot;′s keel was laid down on 16 January 1939 by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 20 December 1939, sponsored by Miss Lucia Ellis, and commissioned on 3 June 1940 with Lieutenant commander John W. Murphy Jr. in command.

==Service history==
===1940-1941===
After fitting out at New London, &quot;Tambor&quot; got underway on 6 August 1940 for her shakedown cruise which took her to New York City, Washington, D.C., Morehead City, North Carolina, and Houston, Texas. Following further training off Colón, Panama, the submarine returned to New London, Connecticut, before holding her acceptance trials and undergoing a post-shakedown overhaul at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. After conducting live-fire trials on the effectiveness of depth charges, the first of their kind in the U.S. Navy, &quot;Tambor&quot; reported in May 1941 to the Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, and the command of Rear Admiral Thomas Withers (). &quot;Tambor&quot; began a routine peacetime patrol in late November 1941.

===World War II===
====December 1941–March 1942====
&quot;Tambor&quot; was off Wake Island when hostilities with Japan broke out with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. She was forced to return to Pearl Harbor with one diesel engine out of commission. Routed back to Mare Island Navy Yard at Mare Island, California, where the damage was repaired, she returned to Pearl Harbor in March 1942.

====First war patrol====
&quot;Tambor&quot; began her first war patrol on 15 March 1942 when she stood out of Pearl Harbor to reconnoiter the areas around Wake Island, Truk, New Ireland, New Britain, and Rabaul. In all, she made nine attacks; on 16 April, she fired two torpedoes at tanker &quot;Kitami Maru&quot;. One hit, and she was credited with a sinking; this was not verified by postwar examination of Japanese records. &quot;Tambor&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 12 May, where her skipper criticized the torpedoes.

====Second war patrol====
After refitting, she was then assigned to Task Group 7.1. The group of six submarines sailed for Midway Island on 21 May 1942 to begin patrolling a circle in anticipation of the invasion fleet intelligence had reported was &quot;en route&quot; there. At 07:15 on 4 June 90 minutes after first reported contact, , Admiral Robert H. English, informed his submarines, waiting until after 11:00 to order them to close. Running surfaced, &quot;Tambor&quot; was strafed by aircraft

At 02:15 on 5 June, &quot;Tambor&quot; radioed sighting &quot;four large ships&quot; north of Midway, at a range of . The ships were far enough away to make identification difficult, and the subs on patrol had been warned that &quot;friendlies&quot; might be on patrol in that area. Murphy changed course to keep contact until he could be sure of their identity.

Shortly after this sighting, Yamamoto ordered the cruisers to turn north, away from their original course for Midway. &quot;Tambor&quot; soon sighted them again, at 0238. The sub was now in front of the Japanese ships, which changed heading again, to the northwest. At 0258, Murphy turned due west, hoping to put them between him and the moon so their silhouettes would make them easier to identify. After losing and regaining sight of the cruisers in the dark, Murphy made an educated guess, turning left again, and re-sighted the ships.

At 0400, with the approach of dawn and improving visibility, the general shape of the ships became clear, but it was still not possible to see enough detail to determine exactly whose ships they were. At 0412, Murphy ordered the signalman to use the signal light to send an ID signal. When the response was unintelligible, the sub crash-dived. When there was no attack, the sub was brought to periscope depth, where damage to the cruiser ″s bow was easily visible.

When &quot;Tambor&quot; had sailed across in front of the line of cruisers in an effort to see them more clearly, the lead ship had sighted the sub and ordered a change of course. &quot;Mogami&quot; had turned a bit late and had collided with , sailing just in front of her, and 40 feet of her bow was compressed and pushed nearly perpendicular to the rest of the ship. The next day, based on &quot;Tambor&#x27;s&quot; report, and following the oil slick, dive bombers found the two damaged cruisers and their destroyer escorts and were able to sink &quot;Mikuma&quot;—the largest Japanese non-carrier sunk to that point in the war. This proved to be &quot;Tambor&#x27;s&quot; best (and among her only) contribution to the battle.

The captain ordered the sub to pursue the cruisers. Since surface pursuit would have been suicide, as the cruisers could have easily destroyed &quot;Tambor&quot; with their guns, the sub was forced to submerge. Since best speed while submerged was only nine knots, and the cruisers were estimated as making seventeen knots, they were soon lost. &quot;Tambor&quot; played no further role in the battle.

On 7 June, responding to a radar contact, &quot;Tambor&quot; dived. An exploding bomb damaged both her periscopes and cracked all four battery blower motors. The bomb probably came from an American B-17; a similar incident had happened the day before, when another B-17 had bombed the submarine USS Grayling, mistaking it for a Japanese cruiser. &quot;Tambor&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 16 June for repairs.

Along with several other sub skippers, Lt.Cdr. Murphy was promptly relieved of command, for timidity in the face of the enemy in light of &quot;Tambor&quot;&#x27;s failure to close with and attack the enemy, or at least identify and properly shadow the Japanese cruiser force so aircraft could be vectored to the location (a regular task for both Japanese and American submarines and the primary purpose for which &quot;Tambor&quot; was there at all). Lt.Cdr. Murphy&#x27;s lack of aggressiveness had hampered Spruance&#x27;s intelligence of the battle and had played an important role in allowing , and to escape almost certain destruction from air attack. Murphy was sent to a shore post, being replaced in command of &quot;Tambor&quot; by Lt.Cdr. Steven H. Armbruster.

====Third war patrol====
Her next patrol (now in the hands of Stephen H. Ambruster) began on 24 July 1942 at Pearl Harbor, ending on 19 September at Fremantle, Australia. &quot;Tambor&quot; searched for enemy shipping in the Marshall Islands. On 7 August near Wotje Atoll, she sank the converted net tender &quot;Shofaka&quot; with one torpedo which broke her in half. &quot;Tambor&quot; remained in the Marshalls until 19 August when she was ordered to patrol the southern passages to Truk. As there was time to spare before she was to take station there, she prowled through the Caroline Islands. On 21 August near Ponape, the submarine fired a spread of three torpedoes at a freighter and her escort. The first hit the target amidships and the other two aft, blowing off the stern. &quot;Shinsei Maru No. Six&quot; quickly sank. On 1 September, she fired four torpedoes at a tanker off Truk and damaged it with one hit. She was credited with two ships for 12,000 tons; this was reduced to 5,800 tons postwar.

====Fourth war patrol====
&quot;Tambor&quot; sailed for Hainan Strait on 12 October 1942 and (in part due to torpedo shortages) laid mines. On 3 November, she fired three torpedoes at a freighter, but all missed. The submarine eluded detection and, 30 minutes later, fired two more. One hit amidships, and &quot;Chikugo Maru&quot; went under by the stern. On 6 November, she fired two torpedoes at a cargo-passenger ship flying the French flag, but both missed. On 10 November, she closed on an unarmed sampan, took its crew on board and sank it by gunfire. Credited with one ship for 10,000 tons (reduced to 2,500 tons postwar), &quot;Tambor&quot; returned to Fremantle on 21 November for refit, during which her deck gun was replaced by a five-inch (127 mm)/25cal gun.

====Fifth war patrol====
From 18 December 1942 to 28 January 1943, &quot;Tambor&quot; patrolled Sunda Strait between Krakatau and Thartway Island. The only target sighted was an enemy destroyer which she attacked on 1 January 1943. The submarine&#x27;s spread of four torpedoes missed, and she went deep to avoid the 18 depth charges that followed. On 29 December 1942, &quot;Fukken Maru&quot; was sunk by a mine laid by &quot;Tambor&quot;.

====Sixth war patrol====
&quot;Tambor&quot; sailed from Fremantle on 18 February 1943 to carry out a special mission in the Philippine Islands, in support of &quot;MacArthur&#x27;s Guerrillas&quot;. On 5 March, she landed a small party headed by Lt.Cdr. Charles Parsons with 50,000 rounds of .30 (7.62 mm) ammunition, 20,000 rounds of .45 ACP (11.4 mm) ammunition, and $10,000 in currency on southern Mindanao. On 22 March, she fired three torpedoes at a tanker southwest of Apo Island. {This was the &quot;Bugen Maru&quot;, which was damaged} Seven days later, she scored one hit on a freighter out of three torpedoes fired and believed it sank; it was not confirmed. The submarine returned to Fremantle on 14 April for refit in which a 20-millimeter gun was installed forward of the bridge.

====Seventh war patrol====
&quot;Tambor&quot;″s seventh patrol (now under Russell Kefauver) took her north of the Malay Barrier from 7 May to 27 June 1943. On 26 May, she fired a spread of three torpedoes at a tanker that all missed. Three days later, three more missed a cargo ship. She tried again several hours later, saw two of the three torpedoes fired score hits, and heard three explosions. As the target was sinking, she fired another spread of three at an accompanying freighter. Some of the crew of &quot;Eiski Maru&quot; escaped in two lifeboats. On 2 June and on 6 June, she fired spreads of three torpedoes at cargo ships. The first appeared to break in half, and the second seemed to sink; there is no record of the sinkings in Japanese official records. {&quot;Eika Maru&quot; was sunk 2 June.} On 16 June, &quot;Tambor&quot; fired her last three torpedoes at a tanker off Cam Ranh Bay but all missed. Her score for the patrol postwar was one ship of 2,500 tons.

====Eighth war patrol====
&quot;Tambor&quot; stood out of Fremantle for the last time on 20 July 1943 &quot;en route&quot; to Lombok Strait. On 27 July the &quot;Teiken Maru&quot; was sunk by a mine laid by the Tambor On 3 August, she sighted five cargomen and a destroyer in Palawan Passage. Three shots at a freighter produced two hits, and one fired at another target missed; Japanese records do not indicate any sinking. On 21 August, she sighted an unescorted convoy of three tankers and five freighters. She fired five torpedoes at a pair of freighters, but scored no hits. Two more sped toward a tanker and produced one explosion but no apparent damage. The next day, she sighted another convoy heading in the opposite direction. Making a submerged attack, &quot;Tambor&quot; fired five torpedoes at a large freighter. Three made perfect hits amidships but all failed to explode, and she sank no ships. The submarine set sail for Midway, arriving 7 September. She transited through Pearl Harbor on her way to San Francisco, on 20 November for major overhaul.

====Ninth war patrol====
&quot;Tambor&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 15 December 1943 and held refresher training during the remainder of the month. She began her ninth war patrol on 5 January 1944. Her assigned area was in the East China Sea. She sighted a &quot;Natori&quot;-class cruiser on 22 January, but lost contact in a rain squall. Six days later, she contacted a convoy of nine ships heading north and tracked it until 01:56 the next day. She then fired two torpedoes at a cargo ship in a surface attack. Both hit and sent &quot;Shuntai Maru&quot; down by the bow. An escort headed straight for the submarine and ramming seemed inevitable. &quot;Tambor&quot; opened fire with her aft 20-millimeter gun and turned hard to port causing the escort to pass astern. After evading the escort, the submarine tried to regain contact with the convoy but failed.

On 2 February, she began tracking two ships. The following morning, she fired two torpedoes at a cargo ship, and both hit amidships. She directed two more at a tanker, and one hit forward of the target&#x27;s stack. Both &quot;Ariake Maru&quot; and &quot;Goyo Maru&quot; sank. &quot;Tambor&quot; went deep and remained on the bottom under depth charge attack from 04:18 to 13:15. Ten days later, she encountered another three-ship convoy. In a night surface attack, the submarine fired a spread of three torpedoes at a cargo ship. As &quot;Tambor&quot; submerged, her crew heard one hit and sank the passenger-cargo ship &quot;Ronsan Maru&quot;. Her patrol was a success, with four ships confirmed sunk, a total of 18,400 tons.

====Tenth war patrol====
After refit at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Tambor&quot; put to sea on 9 April 1944 &quot;en route&quot; to the Mariana Islands. On 18 April, she attacked a 250-ton trawler loaded with food and fresh vegetables. A boarding party from the submarine killed seven members of the Japanese vessel&#x27;s crew and captured the second officer. The Americans removed the ship&#x27;s papers and left her afire and sinking. {This was the gunboat &quot;Shinku Maru No. 3&quot;} On 10 May, she contacted an eight-ship convoy, escorted by five destroyers and two destroyer escorts. In a submerged attack, &quot;Tambor&quot; fired four torpedoes at a cargo ship and heard two explosions, then went deep, taking 50 depth charges from the escorts. &quot;Tambor&quot; surfaced later and attempted to close the convoy once more. However, a destroyer picked her up and subjected her to another depth charge attack.{The sunk ship was the &quot;Keiyo Maru&quot;} On 26 May she scored two hits which sank &quot;Chigo Maru&quot; (650 tons). &quot;Tambor&quot;″s tenth patrol ended at Midway on 2 June.

====Eleventh war patrol====
The submarine (now in the hands of William J. Germershausen) conducted her next patrol in the waters off southern Hokkaidō and the Kuril Islands from 16 July to 23 August 1944. She fired three torpedoes at a freighter on 28 July and heard three explosions. However, a dense fog prohibited her seeing the results. {possibly the escort reported to have been damaged by &quot;unknown cause&quot;} On 13 August, &quot;Tambor&quot; made a surface attack against a cargo ship and then photographed &quot;Toei Maru&quot; (2,300 tons) as she lowered two lifeboats and sank in 20 minutes. After returning to Midway, &quot;Tambor&quot; continued to Pearl Harbor for refit.

====Twelfth war patrol====
&quot;Tambor&quot; returned to Midway on 6 October 1944, and sailed the next day for the Tokyo Bay area. On 15 October, she fired four torpedoes at three radar pips and heard one explosion. She was forced to go deep to evade 26 depth charges. She emerged with no damage. Four days later, she attacked an escort with four torpedoes and heard four explosions, but no sinking was verified. The submarine returned to Saipan from 8 to 10 November, then resumed her patrol, now one of six members of the wolfpack &quot;Burt&#x27;s Brooms&quot; (named for Thomas B. Klakring, commanding SubDiv 101).
Shortly before midnight on 15 November, &quot;Tambor&quot; fired three torpedoes at a patrol boat, but scored no hits. Forty-five minutes later, three more missed. At 06:10, the submarine&#x27;s commander decided to battle on the surface with his deck guns; the escort fired back, and a &quot;Tambor&quot; crewmen was severely wounded. Thirty minutes later, as the target began to sink, &quot;Tambor&quot;″s crew took two prisoners from the water. She transferred them and the wounded crewman to on 18 November. {The sunken vessel was the guardship &quot;Takashiro Maru&quot;}&quot;Tambor&quot; ended her last war patrol at Pearl Harbor on 30 November 1944, to be retired from combat.

Routed onward to the United States, &quot;Tambor&quot; arrived at San Francisco on 10 December 1944. After an extended overhaul, the submarine sailed for Puget Sound on 9 March 1945. Upon her arrival, &quot;Tambor&quot; began training operations with Navy patrol aircraft under Fleet Air Wing 6. World War II ended with the cessation of hostilities with Japan on 15 August 1945 (14 August on the other side of the International Date Line in Hawaii).

===Post-World War II===
On 17 September 1945, &quot;Tambor&quot; departed the United States West Coast for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. She was decommissioned there on 10 December 1945 and placed in reserve.

In April 1947, &quot;Tambor&quot; was assigned to the Ninth Naval District to train United States Naval Reserve personnel, and reported to the Naval Reserve Training Center, Detroit, Michigan, on 8 December 1947. &quot;Tambor&quot; remained on this station until 1959.

&quot;Tambor&quot; was drydocked at Toledo, Ohio, on 2 October 1953, the first-ever drydocking of a submarine on the Great Lakes. The shipyard had to remove her deck guns to get her light enough to fit on the blocks. She spent five weeks in drydock for a routine overhaul, being covered in of paint, including six coats on her anchor chain.

==Disposal==
In 1959 a Board of Inspection and Survey found &quot;Tambor&quot; unfit for further naval service. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 September 1959 and subsequently sold for scrap.

<text>The New Zealand falcon (, &quot;kārewarewa&quot;, or &quot;kāiaia&quot;; Falco novaeseelandiae) is New Zealand&#x27;s only falcon, and one of only four living native and two endemic birds of prey. It is frequently mistaken for the larger and more common swamp harrier. It is the country&#x27;s most threatened bird of prey, with only around 5000–15000 individuals remaining. Under the New Zealand Threat Classification System the falcon is stable at Threatened, with conservation research needed.

==Taxonomy==
The New Zealand falcon was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the falcons and eagles in the genus &quot;Falco&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Falco novaeseelandiae&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;New-Zealand falcon&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1781 by the English ornithologist John Latham. Latham had examined specimens both in the British Museum and in the Leverian Museum.

Ornithologists variously described the New Zealand falcon as an aberrant hobby or as allied to three South American species – &quot;F. deiroleucus&quot; (orange-breasted falcon), &quot;F. rufigularis&quot; (bat falcon), and &quot;F. femoralis&quot; (aplomado falcon); molecular phylogenetic studies show that it is most closely related to the aplomado falcon. Three forms are apparent from their significantly different sizes, with the larger ‘eastern falcon’ form in the eastern and central South Island, the smaller ‘bush falcon’ form in the central and south North Island, and an intermediary ‘southern falcon’ form in Fiordland, Stewart Island, and the Auckland Islands. The relationships between the distantly spaced populations of the southern form are uncertain. Although neutral genetic markers show a recent history of the two more distinct forms, the substantial size difference is likely to be driven by ecological adaptation as they occupy different habitats. Conservation management had already avoided mixing of the different populations. The forms are classified separately under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. The eastern falcon is Threatened, Nationally Vulnerable with a stable population. The southern falcon is Threatened, Nationally Endangered with less than 1000 estimated individuals. The bush falcon is Nationally Increasing.

==Description==
The forms of the New Zealand falcon differ in size, colouration, and habitat. The eastern falcon is larger and paler, while the bush falcon is smaller and darker. The southern falcon sits between the other forms in colouration and size, but has a habitat more similar to the bush falcon. The eastern falcon on average has more white tail bars in their tail feathers than the other two forms. The bush falcon primarily lives in forests while the eastern falcon is present in open steppe habitats. The bush falcons have shorter wings with better manoeuvrability within forests.

Male New Zealand falcons are about two-thirds the size of female falcons. The eastern form of the New Zealand falcon has an average wingspan of 83 cm (33 inches) in females and 72 cm (28 inches) in males. Males of the eastern form range in weight from 300g to 350g (10.6oz-12.3oz), and the bush form ranges from 250g to 300g (8.8oz-10.6oz). Females of the eastern form weigh between 450g and 600g (15.9oz-21.2oz), and females of the bush form weigh between 400g to 500g (14.1oz-17.6oz). The southern falcon weight sits between the eastern and bush forms.

Adult falcons have black, barred rufous, or grey feathers on their crown, nape, and back. The tail is black with white bars that vary in number. The wing tips are rounded and feathers are black or grey with bars on the inside. There is a cream streak down the throat from the beak and the breast is cream, with vertical streaks of black or dark brown. The abdomen is cream with streaked rufous. The base of the beak, eyes, and legs are all yellow. The beak is black with a tomial tooth. The claws are black and the eyes are dark brown. The legs are a dull yellow, which become vibrant for males during the breeding season.

Juvenile New Zealand falcons have a darker colouration and faint tail bars. The breast is brown and the abdomen is cream with fine brown streaks. The soft parts that become yellow are instead olive green, sky blue, or dull grey in adolescent falcons under 9 months old. The full adult plumage is reached by 16 months.

==Distribution and habitat==
The New Zealand falcon is only found in New Zealand.

The native habitat of the eastern falcons in the eastern and central South Island is open country and steppes, with nests on steep slopes or rock ledges. In native podocarp broadleaf forests of the North Island the bush falcon hunts at forest edges and nests in pre-existing tree structures such as epiphytes and tree cavities of mature trees, or on a sheltered ground area. The southern falcon is found in the Auckland Islands, Stewart Island, and Fiordland in forest habitats near oceans, with ecological similarities to the bush falcon rather than the closer eastern falcon.

The native habitats of the New Zealand falcon have been reduced through human development of land for the purposes of agriculture, vineyards, forestry, and housing, impacting nest sites and prey abundance. The habitat range of the falcon has increased to include human-modified landscapes such as pine plantations in the North island and farmlands in the South Island. Falcons have been recorded living in or near exotic pine plantation stands since the 1990s, nesting in stands that are unplanted or less than 5 years old. Regeneration of other plants in older stands prevents the falcon from nesting on the ground. Eastern falcons in the South Island were translocated to vineyards in Marlborough and have been breeding successfully since 2006 with the help of supplementary feeding, hunting vineyard pests, and predator-proof nest sites.

==Ecology and behaviour==
The New Zealand falcon is a sedentary bird that spends most of its time within or close to its home range. The home range of a falcon varies, with calculations from 200 km² to 15 km², with dependence on food availability. Outside of the breeding season solitary or pairs of falcons will use permanent sheltered roosts. The falcon will use a temporary roost during the breeding season if their nest site is far away from their permanent roost.

The falcon is noted to sunbathe for up to 30 minutes in the morning with its darker back to the sun.

The New Zealand falcon is aggressive to non-prey animals. When confronting another falcon, a swamp harrier, or strong prey on the ground the falcon will push its weight back towards its fanned tail and open its wings slightly. Its eyes stay on the combatant and it keeps its feet free to attack. It will sometimes lie on its back and defend itself with its feet. When intruders such as swamp harriers and humans get too close to nests the falcon will make loud &quot;kekking&quot; noises alongside stooping at the head of the intruder. Aggression towards other New Zealand falcons is seen during the breeding season but subsides outside of it. Observations of captive falcons stooping rabbits and a cat were noted as playful or territorial rather than for hunting purposes. Falcons of all ages and sexes will play, initiated by turning their head upside down. They will chase, swoop and mock-attack each other, or if alone they will attack sticks, clumps of grass, or roots. Breeding pairs will often play together. Sometimes prey is caught several times before being killed, as play or practice.

The New Zealand falcon has a high-pitched &quot;kek kek kek&quot; call that is usually heard in territory defence, with the male’s call at a higher pitch than the female’s. Adults will also chitter to each other, particularly after copulation. The &quot;kekking&quot; call is 3–12 syllables, is used by both sexes all year, and travels over long distances. The chitter is 3–6 syllables and is used with other falcons. There is a ‘chup’ call which sounds like the first syllable of a chitter, which is often used during play. In serious situations with other predators the falcon will ‘squeal’. The squeal is sometimes used by captive falcons during handling.

Both endoparasites and exoparasites have been noted on the New Zealand falcon, but are not considered a major threat. Lice are common on fledglings but once the down is replaced by adult feathers their abundance decreases.

=== Food and feeding ===
The New Zealand falcon has a wide range of prey it hunts, but is mostly made up of live introduced and native birds caught in the air. The composition of bird prey is largely based on species abundance with little selection. The most common avian prey includes introduced finch species, silvereyes, blackbirds, and the yellowhammer. The falcon is adept at capturing introduced birds, with their make up in the prey composition being slightly higher than their proportional abundance. There is also little preference shown for the size of the prey, with birds from the 7g (0.25 oz) grey warbler to the 1300g (45.9 oz) pheasants hunted successfully. The falcon evolved without the presence of mammalian prey, but now small mammals like hares, rabbits, stoats, and rats make up a small part of their diet. They also hunt skinks and hard-bodied insects like beetles, locusts, and dragonflies. As the prey composition is closely related to the local species abundance, studies on the diet of the three forms come with slightly different results. The eastern falcon is recorded with a higher proportion of mammalian prey than the bush falcon. In pine plantations the bush falcon hunts a higher proportion of introduced birds. The southern falcon hunts forest birds as well as seabirds when they come in at dusk, and one was recorded eating a 975g (34.4 oz) little blue penguin.

The New Zealand falcon has little competition for food as there are no native mammalian predators, and 2 other native birds of prey are nocturnal. They do compete with the swamp harrier, which searches for prey while flying. The competition reduces over winter when the swamp harrier relies more on carrion that the falcon doesn’t eat.

The New Zealand falcon has many hunting techniques used to catch their wide variety of live prey, including multiple aerial hunting techniques for catching avian prey in the air or on the ground. These techniques are often used in combination with one another. It often hunts around forest edges or rivers where there are breaks from cover. It can search for prey from a still perched position, from flying, or stalking on the ground. When still-hunting it will perch and preen in a seemingly inactive way, moving perch every 10 or so minutes until it detects prey. It has two aerial searching techniques. It can soar and prospect 50m to 200m (164 ft-656 ft) high, which often leads to a direct or stooping attack on high flying prey. The more effective search strategy is contour-hugging, a fast flight that follows the shape of the landscape and allows the falcon to sneak up on and attack agile birds. These techniques lead to quick tail-chases and attacks rather than stalking like other birds of prey due to the fast flying speed of the falcon. Stalking occurs on the ground, usually after noticing the prey from above or after chased prey escapes to the ground. When prey escapes into dense foliage cover a falcon will dive after it to flush out the prey with the impact, then resume the chase. It has flexible and resilient feathers which protect it from injury during this, unlike other raptors. The falcon also has excellent hearing and will find prey through listening, particularly with nests of bird chicks. The falcon is not willing to dive into water after prey.

When prey is found it is quickly attacked. The most common is a direct flying attack, often made at low elevations where the falcon is above the prey. It approaches with a loud fast flapping-flight, using foliage cover or a rapid approach to take the prey by surprise. This is the first attack used by young falcons and has a success rate of around 40%. It is efficient on slow prey, but if used alongside contour-hugging it can be successful on fast and agile prey. If the first attack on a bird doesn’t succeed a tail-chase will ensue for up to 15 minutes before catching the prey or giving up. The falcon will stay 2m to 4m (6.6 ft-13.1 ft) behind the bird, and can prevent prey from diving into cover by getting underneath and cutting it off. In the air the falcon can also use stooping, where it dives 100m to 200m (328 ft-656 ft) and strikes the prey with its feet. Steeper dives are used on larger birds, and multiple stoops can be used to push the prey to the ground so it&#x27;s vulnerable enough for a direct attack. Stooping can be used as a surprise attack from greater heights, but is most common within tail-chases and in cooperative hunting where two falcons take turns to climb and stoop, wearing out the prey. The most successful attack is the glide attack, used by the falcon from a perched position. The falcon glides down and picks up speed, closing then quickly opening its wings and tail feathers before attacking the prey. This attack is quiet, quick, and very successful, but not commonly used by falcons in open areas.

The New Zealand falcon has also been recorded hunting on the ground, extracting nestlings from tree-hole or crevice nests, and stalking lizards. In the Auckland Islands they hunt seabirds at night under the forest canopy, and enter seabird burrows to catch live chicks.

Once the New Zealand falcon subdues its avian, mammalian, or reptilian prey, it kills it by dislocating the neck vertebrate with its beak. This usually occurs on the ground but can also occur in the air. From there it picks up the prey and moves it to a more suitable location for feeding. It starts by eating the back of the head, then consuming the head. The deaths of small mammals and birds that are found headless are often attributed to the falcon. The falcon then feeds from the neck down, plucking feathers down the body in birds but not removing fur in mammals. Bits of the legs and wings are left uneaten, and plucked feathers can be used to identify the type of prey. After eating the falcon will clean itself off and fly elsewhere for an inactive period. Indigestible parts that are eaten are later regurgitated as a pellet. Captured insects are held in one foot and killed by the crushing of either the head or thoracic region. Inedible parts are discarded. Captive falcons or wild individuals with siblings will spread their wings and tails to cover their newly killed prey with a position called ‘mantling’ before taking it elsewhere to eat.

The New Zealand falcon doesn’t eat carrion unless it is taught how to. Captive falcons are trained to recognise the meat they are given as food. It does however cache prey it has caught but not finished eating, and will take days to eat a large item of prey. The falcon will often kill multiple birds in a row without eating them, instead caching them then returning to hunt more. Caching sites of eastern falcons include high bushes, tussocks, tree-stumps, and small trees, all under 3m (9.8 mi). The falcon is stuffed into a small space and the falcon will examine and adjust the prey until satisfied. Caching occurs throughout the year but occurs more frequently when prey is abundant. Cached prey is used mostly for feeding nestlings, or during midday summer heats when the falcon is lethargic.

Intact seeds have been recorded in New Zealand falcon pellets previously, and were attributed to secondary consumption from eaten frugivorous birds, but there has been one observation of a falcon directly consuming an orange alpine fleshy fruit from &quot;Leucopogon fraseri&quot;. The faecal sac was examined and found to have intact seeds from that plant and another species, &quot;Gaultheria depressa&quot;. Captive falcons have also been observed to eat fruit given to them.

Like other raptors, the use of rangle stomach stones to aid digestion is present in the New Zealand falcon.

===Breeding===
The breeding season spans from October to March, throughout the late spring and summer months. Courtship is initiated by the male, who brings food to the female. The female then chases the male with a following noisy flight with aerobatics performed mostly by the male. The pair will play. Copulation is short and occurs several times with wide intervals of a few hours. Female falcons tend to attempt breeding earlier in their lives than male falcons, with some female falcons successfully breeding in their first year under favourable conditions. The New Zealand falcon tends to stay in the same pair and breeding territory each breeding season. Nests can be consecutively used, or a new nest within 5 km (3.1 mi) of the old one is used.

Nest selection tends to favour sites with views to help with opportunistic hunting and shelter from wind. The New Zealand falcon does not build a nest, but uses pre-existing structures as a nest scrape. The type of nest varies between the different forms.

Eastern falcons mostly nest on cliff ledges. In Otago, the falcons show a preference for unmodified tussock or riparian habitat with steeper slopes up to 39° for their nest scrapes. The nests are found at altitudes between 100m and 1200m (62–745 mi), usually overlook streams, are within 100m (62 mi) of a river, and don’t face south. The distance between pairs varies from 2 km to 13 km (1.2–8 mi). Artificial nesting sites have been provided in vineyards for the New Zealand falcon as a pest control and conservation programme. In native podocarp forests bush falcons nest in epiphytes, tree cavities, and snags on mature trees, but will nest on a sheltered ground spot when these are absent. Epiphytes in emergent trees are preferred for better views of prey and predators, and the foliage of the epiphyte screens the nest on most sides. The nests tend to be close to water.

Bush falcons in the central North Island have been nesting increasingly in pine plantation forests, including the 180,000 ha Kaingaroa forest. They nest in pine stands up to 5 years old, with preference for stands that are unplanted or less than 1 year old, as older stands have higher ground cover and less space for ground nests. Nest scrapes within pine plantations are all on the ground as there are no epiphytes or tree cavities that a falcon would use in a native podocarp forest. Nest scrapes are sheltered by pine debris. In breeding territories of pine stands adjacent to mature native podocarp forests nest scrapes in epiphytes are preferred and the pine stand is only used for hunting. Nests are on average 3 km (1.8 mi) away from each other, but can be as close as 1 km (0.6 mi). Plantation forests tend to have ongoing pest control for invasive mammals that threaten the stand, such as possums, hares, and sometimes rats, making these forests safer from nest predation than uncontrolled native forest. The open space between pine trees and stands allows for easier spotting and hunting of prey within the forest.

The New Zealand falcon will defend its nest territory from threats over 100m away from the nest itself with loud noise and attacks. The defence starts as soon as the nest scrape is made, and the male will defend the nest from up to 500m away, further than the female. They mostly attack swamp harriers, people, cats, dogs, and other large birds, but will also attack intruding horses and helicopters.

2 to 4 eggs are laid from September to December. The ovoid eggs vary in colour, but are usually pale to very dark pink when first laid, and are around 40g (1.4 oz). They then become blotched with brown markings. Incubation time is shared between the male and female parents, with the female doing the majority. During incubation attentiveness stays above 90%, increasing with bad weather conditions and the eggs are left for no longer than 1 minute with exceptions of disturbance events.

After 30–35 days of incubation the chicks hatch, but as low as 25 days has been recorded for the bush falcon and attributed to the warmer area. The chicks hatch with open eyes and ears, white natal down, and pink legs. Brooding is mostly carried out by the female parent and decreases until about 10 days after hatching, when brooding only occurs during bad weather or overnight. A second thicker grey down grows and the chicks can start thermoregulating, then from 14 days feathers start to appear. Prey is delivered to the nest, primarily by the male but as brooding time decreases the female starts hunting as well, though will not travel as far from the nest. During the early nesting period the male will deliver prey to the female, who will feed it to the chicks. The prey delivery is announced with a kekking call that is responded to by begging calls from the chicks and the female when brooding. The begging call is accompanied by a low posture directed at the beak or feet of the parent. It is only after the two week mark that the males will deliver food directly to the chicks. Self feeding starts soon after this. Female falcons tend to perch on trees within 100 m (328 ft) when not incubating or brooding. Prey deliveries increase in frequency until the chicks are about two weeks old, where it stabilises to a consistent frequency of about one prey item per 70 minutes, depending on the hunting conditions. The prey items are dependent on the composition of prey in the area, but are usually other birds, and are cached nearby and delivered again if not fully eaten. By 18 days old the chicks have reached the same size as the adults. One sibling usually receives a higher proportion of prey, with aggressive competition between siblings over food. Fledging occurs at around 5 weeks, slightly longer for females than males. Prey deliveries decrease just before the chicks fledge. Though the incubation and brooding are mostly carried out by the female, in the case that the female parent leaves or dies the male parent will increase attentiveness to make up for the absence and can successfully raise and fledge chicks alone.

After fledging the chicks learn to hunt and fly for at least four weeks. Live chicks of other species are used to teach the fledglings how to hunt. A parent will steal a live chick from a nest and call to the fledglings, dropping the prey for them to catch. The parent will lead the fledgling in a chase of up to 100m before dropping the prey to be caught. The presence of parents and siblings alters their behaviour within this time and should result in a faster development of hunting and flying skills. Juveniles with siblings play more than those without, and as they get older the number of flights is also higher. Within this time juveniles may attempt to hunt, but success is unlikely. Juvenile falcons have no interest in traps used to capture adult New Zealand falcons until about 50 days after fledging.

About two months after fledging the juvenile falcons will disperse from their natal territories. The dispersal distance varies depending on the falcon population in the area and the abundance of food. In a pine plantation forest the mean dispersal distance is 9.5 km (5.9 mi), but dispersal of over 30 km (18.6 mi) occurs. Natal dispersal occurs between March and May, which is when there are the most falcon sightings, and also a higher number of falcon deaths. Recorded deaths are mostly from electrocution, but also include other man-made hazards such as introduced cats, road hazards, shooting, poison, and window strike. Juvenile falcons make up a large proportion of these deaths. Falcons are also killed by swamp harriers, but these deaths aren’t recorded in proportion to their occurrence.

==Relationship with humans==

=== Falconry ===
The Wingspan National Bird of Prey Centre in the Ngongotahā Valley is a captive breeding facility and visitor centre. Wingspan undertakes conservation, education and research activities related to birds of prey found in New Zealand, and provides demonstrations of falconry.

===Falcons for Grapes programme===
In 2005, funding was given by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry towards a programme that uses the falcons to control birds that damage grapes and act as pests in vineyards as well as monitoring the birds and establishing a breeding population in the vicinity of the Marlborough wine region. Initially, four falcons were relocated to the vineyards from the surrounding hills. After the release of a further 15 birds breeding began to occur – the first time it is thought to have happened since land clearance 150 years ago. The falcons are provided with predator-proof artificial nests and supplementary feeding. Breeding pairs within the vineyards are found to have higher nest attendance, brooding, and better feeding than in nearby natural habitats.

=== Cardrona Kārearea Conservation Project ===
The Cardrona Valley in the South Island has a small population of falcons. The five-year project that started in 2019 will focus on collecting data on the kārearea to gather knowledge of sightings, locate breeding pairs, locate and monitor nests, and gain insights on breeding population, habitat use, and territory size.

===Illegal shooting===
New Zealand falcon are fully protected under the Wildlife Act 1953. However, there are many reported instances of falcons being illegally shot. In the 1970s, two decades after being protected, it was estimated that at least 100 falcons were being shot in the South Island each year due to lack of public knowledge and similarity to the swamp harrier. A survey of 100 locals found that only one person knew that falcons were protected. The founder of Wingspan, Debbie Stewart, says: “Most of the birds we get in here have been shot. It’s criminal.” She has also said that human activities lead to the deaths of three-quarters of falcons in their first year. Both Stewart and the Department of Conservation have claimed that people shooting New Zealand falcons have interests in chickens or racing pigeons.

=== Electrocution threat ===

Another ongoing threat to the birds from human activity is electrocution. Both a five-year radio tracking study of released birds in Marlborough and an observational study in Glenorchy have attributed nearly half of the bird deaths to electrocution on 11,000 volt distribution transformers and structures.

===Cultural significance===
In Māori mythology the New Zealand falcon acts as a messenger from a young chief in Whāngāpē to the twin sisters Reitū and Reipae in the Waikato he wished to marry. The twins were picked up by the messenger to travel north, and after an altercation only Reitū travelled north while Reipae stayed in Whangārei and married another chief.

The New Zealand falcon’s head plume would be worn by Māori warriors to be seen as fierce and reckless, like the falcon. The falcon was also seen as bold, assertive, and treacherous. The New Zealand falcon was observed by Māori for weather predictions, as its scream during fine weather foretold rain for the next day and its scream during rain foretold fine weather the next day.

The proverb &quot;Me te kopae kārearea&quot; or &quot;like the nest of kārearea&quot; means &#x27;rarely seen&#x27;.

The New Zealand falcon features on the reverse of the New Zealand $20 note and has twice been used on New Zealand stamps. It was also featured on a collectable $5 coin in 2006.

The Royal New Zealand Air Force&#x27;s aerobatic team is called the Black Falcons.

The kārearea was voted Bird of the Year winner in 2012. The Forest &amp; Bird competition aims to raise awareness about New Zealand&#x27;s native birds, their habitats, and the threats they face.

<text>Floriography (language of flowers) is a means of cryptological communication through the use or arrangement of flowers. Meaning has been attributed to flowers for thousands of years, and some form of floriography has been practiced in traditional cultures throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa.

== History ==

According to Jayne Alcock, grounds and gardens supervisor at the Walled Gardens of Cannington, the renewed Victorian era interest in the language of flowers finds its roots in Ottoman Turkey, specifically the court in Constantinople and an obsession it held with tulips during the first half of the 18th century. In the 14th century, the Turkish tradition sélam had an influence on the language of flowers. Sélam was a game of gifting flowers and objects to send a message, the interpretation of the message revealed through rhymes. 

During the Victorian age, the use of flowers as a means of covert communication coincided with a growing interest in botany. The floriography craze was introduced to Europe by the Englishwoman Mary Wortley Montagu (1689–1762), who brought it to England in 1717, and Aubry de La Mottraye (1674–1743), who introduced it to the Swedish court in 1727. Joseph Hammer-Purgstall&#x27;s (1809) appears to be the first published list associating flowers with symbolic definitions, while the first dictionary of floriography appears in 1819 when Louise Cortambert, writing under pen name Madame Charlotte de la Tour, wrote .

Robert Tyas was a popular British flower writer, publisher, and clergyman, who lived from 1811 to 1879; his book, &quot;The Sentiment of Flowers; or, Language of Flora&quot;, first published in 1836 and reprinted by various publishing houses at least through 1880, was billed as an English version of Charlotte de la Tour&#x27;s book.

Interest in floriography soared in Victorian England, North America and France during the 19th century. Gifts of blooms, plants, and specific floral arrangements were used to send a coded message to the recipient, allowing the sender to express feelings of romance and courtship which could not be spoken aloud in Victorian society. Armed with floral dictionaries, Victorians often exchanged small &quot;talking bouquets&quot; or &quot;word poesy,” called nosegays or tussie-mussies, which could be worn or carried as a fashion accessory. The word &quot;nosegay&quot; was used because the flowers would smell nice and the word &quot;gay&quot; meant ornament. These accessories were originally worn to mask the scent of the streets and body odor, and were often composed of fragrant herbs and flowers such as lavender, lemon balm, and roses. 

During the 16th century, the purpose of the tussie-mussies changed. They were commonly gifted to a love interest. The meaning of flowers was determined by their cultural meanings along with legends and myths. In England and America, courses such as botany, painting flowers, and floral arranging became popular in education, especially for young women. Tussie-mussies are still used in modern-day as corsages and boutonnieres.

In the United States, the first appearance of the language of flowers in print was in the writings of Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, a French-American naturalist, who wrote on-going features under the title &quot;The School of Flora&quot;, from 1827 through 1828, in the weekly &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; and monthly &quot;Casket; or Flowers of Literature, Wit, and Sentiment&quot;. These pieces contained the botanic, English, and French names of the plant, a description of the plant, an explanation of its Latin names, and the flower&#x27;s emblematic meaning; therefore readers could select flowers appropriately to send a message. However, the first books on floriography were Elizabeth Wirt&#x27;s &quot;Flora&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; and Dorothea Dix&#x27;s &quot;The Garland of Flora&quot;, both of which were published in 1829, though Wirt&#x27;s book had been issued in an unauthorized edition in 1828.

During its peak in the United States, the language of flowers attracted the attention of popular writers and editors. Sarah Josepha Hale, longtime editor of the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Magazine&quot; and co-editor of &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot;, edited Flora&#x27;s Interpreter in 1832; it continued in print through the 1860s. Catharine H. Waterman Esling wrote a long poem titled &quot;The Language of Flowers&quot;, which first appeared in 1839 in her own language of flowers book, &quot;Flora&#x27;s Lexicon&quot;; it continued in print through the 1860s. Lucy Hooper, an editor, novelist, poet, and playwright, included several of her flower poems in &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Book of Flowers and Poetry&quot;, first published in 1841. Frances Sargent Osgood, a poet and friend of Edgar Allan Poe, first published &quot;The Poetry of Flowers and Flowers of Poetry&quot; in 1841, and it continued in print through the 1860s.

==Meanings==
The significance assigned to specific flowers in Western culture varied – nearly every flower had multiple associations, listed in the hundreds of floral dictionaries – but a consensus of meaning for common blooms has emerged. Often, definitions derive from the appearance or behavior of the plant itself. For example, the mimosa, or sensitive plant, represents chastity. This is because the leaves of the mimosa close at night, or when touched. Likewise, the deep red rose and its thorns have been used to symbolize both the blood of Christ and the intensity of romantic love, while the rose&#x27;s five petals are thought to illustrate the five crucifixion wounds of Christ. Pink roses imply a lesser affection, white roses suggest virtue and chastity, and yellow roses stand for friendship or devotion. The black rose (in nature, a very dark shade of red, purple, or maroon, or may be dyed) may be associated with death and darkness due to the traditional (Western) connotations of the shade.

&quot;A woman also had to be pretty precise about where she wore flowers. Say, for instance, a suitor had sent her a tussie-mussie ( nosegay). If she pinned it to the &#x27;cleavage of bosom&#x27;, that would be bad news for him, since that signified friendship. Ah, but if she pinned it over her heart, &#x27;That was an unambiguous declaration of love&#x27;.&quot; Details such as positioning of flowers and their buds were very important and carried different messages.

The action of giving flowers served as a silent answer to a question. If flowers were presented with the right hand it would indicate the answer to the question was &quot;yes&quot;, if the flowers were given with the left hand it meant &quot;no&quot;. Important details such as which side the bow was tied determined if the message applied to the person presenting the flowers or the person receiving them.

Later authors inspired by this tradition created lists that associate a birthday flower with each day of the year.

== In literature ==
William Shakespeare, Jane Austen, Charlotte and Emily Brontë, and children&#x27;s novelist Frances Hodgson Burnett, among others, used the language of flowers in their writings.

Shakespeare used the word &quot;flower&quot; more than 100 times in his plays and sonnets. In &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Ophelia mentions the symbolic meanings of flowers and herbs as she hands them to other characters in Act 4, Scene 5: pansies, rosemary, fennel, lilies, columbine, rue and daisy. She regrets she has no violets, she says, &quot;... but they wither&#x27;d all when my father died&quot;. In &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, the princess Perdita wishes that she had violets, daffodils, and primroses to make garlands for her friends. In &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, Oberon talks to his messenger Puck amidst a scene of wild flowers.

In J. K. Rowling&#x27;s 1997 novel &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, Professor Severus Snape uses the language of flowers to express regret and mourning for the death of Lily Potter, his childhood friend and Harry Potter&#x27;s mother, according to &quot;Pottermore&quot;.

Flowers are often used as a symbol of femininity. John Steinbeck&#x27;s short story &quot;The Chrysanthemums&quot; centers around the yellow florets, which are often associated with optimism and lost love. When the protagonist, Elisa, finds her beloved chrysanthemums tossed on the ground, her hobby and womanhood have been ruined; this suffices the themes of lost appreciation and femininity in Steinbeck&#x27;s work.

Hajime Isayama frequently used various types of flowers for symbolism and foreshadowing in his manga series &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;, which also includes Hanakotoba (花言葉), the Japanese form of floriography.

== In art ==
Several Anglican churches in England have paintings, sculpture, or stained glass windows of the lily crucifix, depicting Christ crucified on or holding a lily. One example is a window at The Clopton Chantry Chapel Church in Long Melford, Suffolk, England, UK.

The Victorian Pre-Raphaelites, a group of 19th-century painters and poets who aimed to revive the purer art of the late medieval period, captured classic notions of beauty romantically. These artists are known for their idealistic portrayal of women, emphasis on nature and morality, and use of literature and mythology. Flowers laden with symbolism figure prominently in much of their work. John Everett Millais, a founder of the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, used oils to create pieces filled with naturalistic elements and rich in floriography. His painting &quot;Ophelia&quot; (1852) depicts Shakespeare&#x27;s drowned stargazer floating amid the flowers she describes in Act IV, Scene V of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.
The Edwardian artist John Singer Sargent spent much time painting outdoors in the English countryside, frequently utilizing floral symbolism. Sargent&#x27;s first major success came in 1887, with &quot;Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose&quot;, a large piece painted on site in the plein air manner, of two young girls lighting lanterns in an English garden.

Contemporary artist Whitney Lynn created a site-specific project for San Diego International Airport employing floriography, utilizing flowers&#x27; ability to communicate messages that otherwise would be restricted or difficult to speak aloud. Lynn previously created a work, &quot;Memorial Bouquet&quot;, utilizing floral symbolism for the San Francisco Arts Commission Gallery. Based on Dutch Golden Age still-life painting, the flowers in the arrangement represent countries that have been sites of US military operations and conflicts.

== In the 21st century ==
Floriography in the 21st century has been reduced but has been displayed in different ways. For example, tattoos of flowers and plants may carry symbolism and significance which relate to their historical meaning. The same can be said for jewelry designed and worn based on what the flowers represent. Floriography can still be found in traditional ways through bouquets, a common example of this would be the common practice of gifting red roses on Valentine&#x27;s Day to represent love and romance and wearing poppies for remembrance. The gifting of flowers is not always personal, businesses and organizations may send floral arrangements to communicate professionalism and success. While the traditional use of floriography may have changed, the symbolism of flowers continues to provide a connection between humans and nature.

<text>In the Country of Last Things is a dystopian epistolary novel written by American author Paul Auster, first published in 1987.

== Plot summary ==

The novel takes the form of a letter from a young woman named Anna Blume. Anna has ventured into an unnamed city that has collapsed into chaos and disorder. In this environment, no industry takes place and most of the population collects garbage or scavenges for objects to resell. Anna has entered the city to search for her brother William, a journalist, and it is suggested that the Blumes come from a world to the East which has not collapsed.

Anna arrives in the city with William&#x27;s address, and an address and photo for Samuel Farr, whom William&#x27;s editor sent to the city after failing to receive word from William. However, in a turn of events she later understands to be typical of life in the city, she finds that not only has William&#x27;s house been demolished, but the entire street where he lived has been reduced to rubble. Anna lives on the streets of the city as an &#x27;object hunter&#x27;, a job which involves scavenging for specific objects rather than collecting general waste.

One day, Anna saves the life of Isabel, an older woman. Isabel is, like Anna, an object hunter, despite her advanced age, and has an uncanny knowledge of where and when to find the objects they require. She lives with her husband, Ferdinand, a rude man who does not work, but makes ships in bottles from small waste materials he finds. Ferdinand tries to rape Anna, but she, trying to scare him away, starts to strangle him and gives up before he dies, while Isabel is supposedly asleep. Anna and Isabel discover that Ferdinand had died in the morning, hinting that Isabel had finished the job later that evening. Isabel and Anna, not wanting to simply leave his body in the street or carry it to a crematorium, throw it from the roof of their apartment building, making it seem as if Ferdinand had committed suicide. Soon after, Isabel becomes ill, and can no longer work. She dies, and after Anna has taken her body to be cremated, housebreakers arrive at her apartment and overpower her, making her homeless once again.

After having been homeless for a period, Anna is forced to run from a police officer, and goes through the first open door she sees, which turns out to be the city&#x27;s national library. Parts of the library have been allocated by the government for academics and religious groups. She meets a rabbi, leading a small group of Jewish inhabitants of the city. Anna reveals that she too is a Jew, but no longer believes in God (see Jewish atheism). The group cannot help Anna on her mission to find William, but one of the rabbi&#x27;s accomplices directs her to Samuel Farr, who it transpires is also living in the library.

Despite initial hostility, Sam accepts Anna into his life, and the two live together and become lovers. Sam is working on a book about the city, but is swiftly running out of money. Anna remedies the couple&#x27;s financial situation with the money she has obtained from selling Isabel and Ferdinand&#x27;s possessions, and the two are able to live in relative comfort and afford luxury items such as cigarettes. This period is described as one of Anna&#x27;s happiest. However, the Jewish groups are forced to leave the library when the government decides to exert its authority, and are replaced by a man named Dujardin, of whom Anna is suspicious.

Anna&#x27;s shoes start to wear out, and Sam refuses to let Anna leave their apartment until he has procured a new pair, especially because Anna is now pregnant. This takes time, however, and Anna is tempted by an offer from Dujardin to buy her a pair from his cousin, and, despite her initial dislike of him, she accepts his offer. She follows him to his cousin&#x27;s house, but realizes she has been tricked, and that the house is a human slaughterhouse. Anna jumps from a window and escapes, and is taken in by the patrons of Woburn House, a homeless shelter. When she awakes, she lives in luxury, but is deeply distressed to hear that a fire has broken out at the library, Sam&#x27;s whereabouts are unknown, and she has had a miscarriage. Anna takes a position at Woburn House, and becomes close to her colleagues; Victoria, the daughter of the House&#x27;s founder, Dr. Woburn; Frick, an older man who serves as a driver and has a strange way of speaking; Willie, Frick&#x27;s introverted fifteen-year-old grandson; and Boris Stepanovich, an enigmatic character responsible for procuring food and supplies for the House.

Anna enters a love affair with Victoria, which helps her recover from losing Sam. She is appointed to a position in which she interviews prospective residents of the House, which she finds emotionally draining. She vents her anger on an interviewee, then falls asleep, and awakes to find Sam sitting opposite her. He has lived in an abandoned railway station since the fire in the library, and has become almost unrecognizable. He is taken in immediately, though, and begins to make progress. When he returns to full health, Victoria asks him to contribute to the House by pretending to be a doctor: there is no longer any medical equipment except for painkillers and bandages, so the charade is unlikely to be uncovered, and people enjoy telling him their stories. However, Boris tells Anna that Woburn House is financially unsustainable, as it relies on a finite supply of items taken from Dr. Woburn&#x27;s collection. She comes to realize that the House cannot continue forever, and cutbacks are made to the provisions granted to residents.

Frick dies, and is given a burial in the House&#x27;s garden, against the city&#x27;s laws. However, the burial is reported to the police by an unknown resident, and they arrive to dig up the body. The police are dissuaded by Boris Stepanovich from taking further measures, but Willie has been deeply affected by the events. He starts to act erratically, and eventually violently, taking a gun and murdering several residents of the House, before turning on Victoria, Sam and Anna. Sam shoots him before he can reach them, but too much damage has been done to the House and its reputation for it to continue.

The House closes down and, with the last of their money (taken from selling the remnants of the Woburn collection and Boris&#x27;s personal wealth), the four obtain travel permits. The novel ends with Anna considering the best way for them to leave the city, and telling the unknown acquaintance to whom she is writing that she will write again. It is unknown whether the letter was sent, and whether Anna, Victoria, Sam and Boris were successful in their attempt to leave the city.

The &#x27;last things&#x27; in the title of the book refers not only to the disappearance of manufactured objects and technology but also the fading of memories of them and the words used to describe them.

<text>A is a word or phrase associated with a particular season, used in traditional forms of Japanese poetry. Kigo are used in the collaborative linked-verse forms renga and renku, as well as in haiku, to indicate the season referred to in the stanza. They are valuable in providing economy of expression.

==History==
Representation of, and reference to, the seasons has long been important in Japanese culture and poetry. The earliest anthology of Japanese poetry, the mid-8th century , contained several sections devoted to the seasons. By the time of the first imperial Japanese anthology, the a century and a half later (AD 905), the seasonal sections had become a much larger part of the anthology. Both of these anthologies had sections for other categories such as love poems and miscellaneous () poems.

The writing of the linked-verse form renga dates to the middle of the Heian period (roughly AD 1000) and developed through the medieval era. Over time, set rules developed for the writing of renga, and its formal structure specified that about half of the stanzas should include a reference to a specific season, depending upon their place in the poem. According to these rules, the (the opening stanza of the renga) must include a reference to the season in which the renga was written. Poets as early as Iio Sogi (1421-1502) introduced the concept of seasonal references with anthologies of seasonal topics.

A lighter form of renga called (&quot;playful&quot; linked verse) was introduced in the 16th century, and became a salon type recreation by the Tokugawa era. Poets soon began to compose independent of the longer, collaborative renga and it began to become an independent style. In the early twentieth century poets began experimenting with breaking the traditional elements of haiku, such as omitting the kigo entirely. This eventually led to the New Haiku and free verse haiku movements, which advocated more modern styles of haiku. Today most Japanese haiku include a kigo, though many haiku written in languages other than Japanese omit it (see for example Haiku in English).

==Significance==
Season words are evocative of images that are associated with the same time of year. For readers in New England, a poem about frost on a pumpkin evokes other sensations and traditions, like frosty air and apple cider. For Higginson writing in &quot;The Haiku Seasons&quot;, season words are a type of logopoeia--a word used not just for its meaning, but for its associations with other ideas.

==Seasons==

The association of kigo with a particular season may be obvious, though sometimes it is more subtle. In Japan, Pumpkins () are a winter squash associated with the autumn harvest. It may be less obvious why the &quot;moon&quot; () is an autumn kigo, since it is visible year round. In autumn the days become shorter and the nights longer, yet they are still warm enough to stay outside, so one is more likely to notice the moon. Often, the night sky will be free of clouds in autumn, with the moon visible. The full moon can help farmers work after the sun goes down to harvest their crops (a &quot;harvest moon&quot;).

===Japanese seasons===
Japan is long from north to south, so the seasonal features vary from place to place. The sense of season in kigo is based on the region between Kyoto and Tokyo, because Japanese classical literature developed mainly in this area. In the Japanese calendar, seasons traditionally followed the lunisolar calendar with the solstices and equinoxes at the middle of a season. The traditional Japanese seasons are:

*Spring: 4 February–5 May
*Summer: 6 May–7 August
*Autumn: 8 August–6 November
*Winter: 7 November–3 February

Within season categories, kigo can denote early, middle, or late parts of a season, which are defined approximately as the first, second, or third month of the season. In linked haiku forms like renku, subsequent linked haiku must move forward in season temporally. There are other rules governing season words in renku, including the frequency of certain season words, and how many stanzas remain in a season, once mentioned.

==&quot;Saijiki&quot; and lists of kigo==

Japanese haiku poets often use a book called a , which lists with example poems. An entry in a usually includes a description of the kigo itself, together with a list of similar or related words, and some examples of haiku that include that kigo. The are divided into the four seasons (and modern usually include a section for seasonless () words). Those sections are divided into a standard set of categories, and then the kigo are sorted within their proper category. &quot;Japan Great Saikiji&quot; uses the sub-categories of season words, the heavens, earth, humanity, observances, animals, and plants. 

Examples of Japanese summer kigo are:

Summer
* The Season: short night, burning, hot
* The Sky and Heavens: rainy season, evening downpour, afterglow, drought
* The Earth: waterfall, summer meadow, clear water
* Humanity: switching clothes, straw mats, swimming, fireworks
* Observances: Boys&#x27; Day (May 5), Gion festival (July)
* Animals: fawn, mosquito, cuckoo
* Plants: peony, lotus flower, orange blossoms, lily, sunflower

==Outside Japan==
Haiku started as a form of Japanese poetry and is now written in many different languages around the world. William J. Higginson&#x27;s &quot;Haiku World&quot; (1996), which is the first international , contains more than 1,000 poems, by over 600 poets writing in 25 languages. The writing of haiku around the world has increased with the advent of the internet, where one can even find examples of haiku written in Latin, Esperanto, and Klingon, as well as numerous examples in more common languages.
Different regions internationally have their own lists of kigo. The Southern California Haiku Study group created their own list, which includes regional weather like June gloom and smog, Forest fires, seasonal events like the Tournament of Roses Parade, and local flora like the Jacaranda.

==Kigo and haiku: an example==
In the famous haiku by Matsuo Bashō below, is a for spring. Haiku had been traditionally written about the singing of mating frogs, but Bashō chose to focus on a very different sound.
==Haiku without kigo==
Haiku without kigo is possible, and are described as (no-season). Because of the practice of anthologizing haiku in saijiki, haiku that did not mention seasons were not as well-known, and many haiku writers assumed that haiku had to contain a kigo. Poems on non-seasonal topics appeared in the imperial anthology , such as love, travel, and religion. Usually about half the stanzas in a renku do not reference a season. In contemporary haiku composition, Japanese haiku writers disagree about if a haiku requires a kigo, while writers outside of Japan feel free to write haiku without kigo. The Modern Haiku Association of Japan published a collection of kigo in 2004 which included non-seasonal kigo.

<text>Katharina von Bora (; 29 January 1499? – 20 December 1552), after her wedding Katharina Luther, also referred to as &quot;die Lutherin&quot; (&#x27;the Lutheress&#x27;), was the wife of the German reformer Martin Luther and a seminal figure of the Protestant Reformation. Although little is known about her, she is often considered to have been important to the Reformation, her marriage setting a precedent for Protestant family life and clerical marriage.

==Ancestry==
Katharina von Bora was the daughter to a family of Saxon lesser nobility. According to common belief, she was born on 29 January 1499 in Lippendorf, but there is no evidence of this in contemporary documents. Due to there being multiple branches in her family and the uncertainty of her birth name, there are diverging theories about her place of birth. One of them proposes that she was born in Hirschfeld and that her parents were Hans von Bora zu Hirschfeld and his wife, born Anna von Haugwitz. It is also possible that Katharina was the daughter of Jan von Bora auf Lippendorf and his wife Margarete, both of whom were only mentioned in 1505.

==Early life==

Her father sent then five-year-old von Bora to a Benedictine convent in Brehna in 1504 to be educated, according to a letter Laurentius Zoch sent to Martin Luther in 1531. At the age of nine, she was moved to Nimbschen Abbey, Cistercian community named &quot;Marienthron&quot; (&#x27;Mary&#x27;s Throne&#x27;) near Grimma, where her maternal aunt was a nun. Von Bora&#x27;s presence is in the financial accounts of 1509/10.

After years of being a nun, von Bora became interested in the growing reform movement and grew dissatisfied with cloistered life. Conspiring with several other sisters, she contacted Luther and begged for his assistance. On 4 April 1523, Holy Saturday, Luther sent Leonhard Köppe, a merchant and councillor of Torgau who regularly delivered herring to the convent. The nuns escaped by hiding in his covered wagon among the fish barrels, and fled to Wittenberg.

Luther asked the family of the nuns to admit them into their houses, but they declined, possibly because this would have made them accomplices to a crime under canon law. 

Within two years, Luther was able to arrange marriages or find employment for all of the escaped nuns except von Bora. She was first housed with the family of Philipp Reichenbach, the municipal clerk of Wittenberg, then with Lucas Cranach the Elder and his wife, Barbara. Von Bora had a number of suitors, including Hieronymus Baumgartner from Nuremberg, and a pastor, Kaspar Glatz from Orlamünde, but none of the proposals resulted in marriage. She told Luther&#x27;s friend and fellow reformer, Nicolaus von Amsdorf, that she would be willing to marry only Luther or von Amsdorf.

==Marriage to Luther==

Martin Luther, as well as many of his friends, was at first unsure of whether he should marry. Philip Melanchthon thought that this would hurt the Reformation by causing scandal. Luther eventually decided that his marriage would &#x27;please his father, rile the pope, cause the angels to laugh, and the devils to weep&#x27;. 26-year-old Von Bora and 41-year-old Luther married on 13 June 1525, before witnesses including Justus Jonas, Johannes Bugenhagen, and Barbara and Lucas Cranach. A small wedding breakfast was held the next morning, and a more formal, public ceremony on 27 June, presided over by Bugenhagen. 

The couple took up residence in the former dormitory and educational institution of Augustinian friars studying in Wittenberg (known as the &#x27;Black Monastery&#x27;), a wedding gift from John, Elector of Saxony, brother of Luther&#x27;s protector Frederick III, Elector of Saxony. Katharina immediately took on the task of managing the monastery&#x27;s vast holdings. She bred and sold cattle and ran a brewery to provide for their family, the numerous students who boarded with them, and her husband&#x27;s visitors. In times of epidemics, she operated a hospital with nurses, working alongside them. Luther called her the &#x27;boss of Zulsdorf&#x27;, after the farm they owned, and the &#x27;morning star of Wittenberg&#x27; for her habit of rising at 4 a.m.

Based on Luther&#x27;s descriptions, his wife, whom he nicknamed &#x27;Herr Käthe&#x27;, exerted much control over his life. She might have even influenced his decisions to a degree; Luther said that his wife &#x27;convince[d] [him] of whatever&#x27; she pleased&#x27;, and explicitly afforded her &#x27;complete control&#x27; over the household, as long as &#x27;his rights&#x27; were &#x27;preserved&#x27;, since &#x27;[f]emale government has never done any good&#x27;. She thus assisted her husband with running their estate and directed renovations when necessary. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Katharina Luther played a wife&#x27;s role as taught by her husband&#x27;s movement: she depended on him financially (although she also increased their estate&#x27;s profits), and respected him as a &#x27;higher vessel&#x27;, always calling him &#x27;Herr Doktor&#x27;. He reciprocated by occasionally consulting her on church matters.

Katharina bore six children: Hans (1526–1575), Elisabeth (1527–1528), Magdalena (1529–1542), Martin (1531–1565), Paul (1533–1593), and Margarete (1534–1570). She also suffered a miscarriage on 1 November 1539. The Luthers raised four orphaned children, including Katharina&#x27;s nephew, Fabian.

=== Significance of the marriage ===
The marriage of von Bora to Luther is very important in the history of Protestantism, specifically in regard to the development of its views on marriage and gender roles. While Luther was not the first cleric to marry because of Reformation ideas, he was one of the most prominent. As he argued publicly for clerical marriage and produced much anti-Catholic propaganda, his marriage became a natural target for his enemies.

==After Luther&#x27;s death==
When Martin Luther died in 1546, Katharina was left in difficult financial straits without Luther&#x27;s salary as professor and pastor, even though she owned land, properties, and the Black Cloister. She had been counselled by Martin Luther to move out of the old abbey and sell it after his death, and move into much more modest quarters with the children who remained at home, but she refused. Luther had named her his sole heir in his last will. His will could not be executed, however, because it did not conform with Saxon law.

Almost immediately after, Katharina had to leave the Black Cloister, now called &quot;Lutherhaus&quot;, by herself, at the outbreak of the Schmalkaldic War, fleeing to Magdeburg. After she returned, the approaching war forced another flight in 1547, this time to Braunschweig. In July 1547, at the close of the war, she was able to return to Wittenberg.

After the war, the buildings and lands of the monastery had been torn apart and laid waste. Cattle and other farm animals had been stolen or killed. If she had sold the land and the buildings, she could have had a good financial situation. Financially, they could not remain there. Katharina was able to support herself thanks to the generosity of John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony, and the princes of Anhalt.

She remained in Wittenberg in poverty until 1552, when an outbreak of the Black Plague and a harvest failure forced her to leave the city once again. She fled to Torgau, where she was thrown from her cart into a watery ditch near the city gates. For three months, she went in and out of consciousness, before dying in Torgau on 20 December 1552, at the age of 53. She was buried at Torgau&#x27;s Saint Mary&#x27;s Church, far from her husband&#x27;s grave in Wittenberg. She is reported to have said on her deathbed, &#x27;I will stick to Christ as a burr to cloth.&#x27;

By the time of Katharina&#x27;s death, the surviving Luther children were adults. After Katharina&#x27;s death, the Black Cloister was sold back to the university in 1564 by his heirs.

Margareta Luther, born in Wittenberg on 27 December 1534, married into a noble, wealthy Prussian family, to Georg von Kunheim (Wehlau, 1 July 1523 – Mühlhausen , 18 October 1611, the son of Georg von Kunheim and wife Margarethe, Truchsessin von Wetzhausen ) but died in Mühlhausen in 1570 at the age of thirty-six.

==Commemoration==
Katharina von Bora is commemorated on 20 December in the Calendar of Saints of some Lutheran churches in the United States. In 2022, she was officially added to the Episcopal Church liturgical calendar with a feast day on 20 December.

In addition to a statue in Wittenberg and several biographies, an opera of her life now keeps her memory alive.

<doc id="518339" wikidata="Q1353390" url="?curid=518339" title="Background music">
<text>Background music (British English: piped music) is a mode of musical performance in which the music is not intended to be a primary focus of potential listeners, but its content, character, and volume level are deliberately chosen to affect behavioral and emotional responses in humans such as concentration, relaxation, distraction, and excitement. Listeners are uniquely subject to background music with no control over its volume and content. The range of responses created are of great variety, and even opposite, depending on numerous factors such as, setting, culture, audience, and even time of day.

Background music is commonly played where there is no audience at all, such as empty hallways, restrooms and fitting rooms. It is also used in artificial space, such as music played while on hold during a telephone call, and virtual space, as in the ambient sounds or thematic music in video games. It is typically played at low volumes from multiple small speakers distributing the music across broad public spaces. Music has proven to improve cognitive processes, enabling the brain to process more information. The widespread use of background music in offices, restaurants, and stores began with the founding of Muzak, or light background music, in the 1930s and was characterized by repetition and simple musical arrangements. Its use has grown worldwide and today incorporates the findings of psychological research relating to consumer behavior in retail environments, employee productivity, and workplace satisfaction. 

Due to the growing variety of settings (from doctors&#x27; offices to airports), many styles of music are utilized as background music. Because the aim of background music is passive listening, vocals, commercial interruptions, and complexity are typically avoided. In spite of the international distribution common to syndicated background music artists, it is often associated with artistic failure and a lack of musical talent in the entertainment industry. There are composers who write specifically for music syndication services such as Dynamic Media and Mood Media, successors of Muzak, and MTI Digital. Multiple studies have correlated the presence of background music with increased spending in retail establishments.

==Types==
===Incidental music===

The use of incidental music dates back at least as far as Greek drama. A number of classical composers have written incidental music for various plays, with the more famous examples including Henry Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Abdelazer&quot; music, George Frideric Handel&#x27;s &quot;The Alchemist&quot; music, Joseph Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Il distratto&quot; music, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Thamos, King of Egypt&quot; music, Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Egmont&quot; music, Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s &quot;Preciosa&quot; music, Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Rosamunde&quot; music, Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; music, Robert Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Manfred&quot; music, Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Arlésienne&quot; music, and Edvard Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; music. Parts of all of these are often performed in concerts outside the context of the play. Vocal incidental music, which is included in the classical scores mentioned above, should never be confused with the score of a Broadway or film musical, in which the songs often reveal character and further the storyline. Vocal incidental music sets the tone for a film through using various beats or sounds, portraying the emotions of certain scenes. Since the score of a Broadway or film musical is what actually makes the work a &quot;musical&quot;, it is far more essential to the work than mere incidental music, which nearly always amounts to little more than a background score; indeed, many plays have no incidental music whatsoever, allowing the actors to express their characters solely through words and their expressions.

===Furniture music===

The term &quot;furniture music&quot; was coined by Erik Satie in 1917, and demonstrated by him in three sets of compositions: &quot;Musique d&#x27;ameublement&quot; (1917), &quot;Sons industriels&quot; (1920) and &quot;Tenture de cabinet préfectoral&quot; (1923). It fell into disuse when the composer died a few years later, and the genre was revived several decades later. After his death, furniture music was reinterpreted and programmed in concerts; many individuals found that it filled the awkward pauses, allowing audiences to become better immersed into the performance. Typical of furniture music are short musical passages, with an indefinite number of repeats. 

===Muzak / Elevator music===

Elevator music (also known as Muzak, piped music, or lift music) is a more general term indicating music that is played in rooms where many people come together (that is, not for the explicit purpose of listening to music), and during telephone calls when placed on hold. There is a specific sound associated with elevator music, but it usually involves simple instrumental themes from &quot;soft&quot; popular music, or &quot;light&quot; classical music being performed by slow strings. More recent types of elevator music may be computer-generated, with the actual score being composed entirely algorithmically.

The term can also be used for kinds of easy listening, piano solo, jazz or middle of the road music, or what are known as &quot;beautiful music&quot; radio stations.

=== Corporate music ===

Corporate music (or corporate &quot;production&quot; music) is a term for background music, made to work with company presentations: rather subtle, understated and unobtrusive. However, it should not be confused with &quot;corporate pop&quot; - pop music produced by corporations and that &quot;blurs the line between independent and mainstream&quot;.

===Video game music===

Video game music (VGM) is a soundtrack for video games. Songs may be original and composed specifically for the game, or preexisting music licensed for use in the game. Music in video games can be heard over a game&#x27;s title screen, menus and during gameplay.
Sometimes, a soundtrack from a videogame can be released separately, as it happened with GTA V&#x27;s in-game &quot;radiostations&quot;

===Website music===
The early social media website Myspace has supported a feature where specific songs chosen by the user would automatically play on their profile pages.

=== Group fitness music ===

With the proliferation of boutique fitness classes in the late 2010s, a new emphasis is being placed on properly licensing music to be used by instructors in a group fitness environment. As it is more interactive than traditional background music, the licensing and cost structures differ.

=== Internet delivered background music ===

Internet-delivered background music was delivered by companies as Mood Media (which had acquired Trusonic, which had acquired Muzak). This allowed the retailer to instantly update music and messages which were deployed at the store level as opposed to using older compact disc and satellite technologies. Using this technique enables the creator to include more meaning in their work and effectively convey their messages. Playing music that affects the mood of the audience urges many emotions, making the work more memorable.

==Background non-music==
===Business audio===
Business audio, also known as copyrighted material, refers to a type of service that provides audio content that is licensed for use in a commercial setting.

Business news can be one example. The term &quot;background music&quot; is another example. Providers of the latter include:
* Cloud Cover Media, Inc.
* StoreStreams Inc
* Muzak Holdings LLC
* DMX
* PlayNetwork
* MTI Digital
* XM for Business
* Music Choice
* CUSTOMtronics Sound
* Applied Media Technologies Corporation
* Trusonic
* Couture Media, Inc.

In the United States, the terms &quot;elevator music&quot; and &quot;Muzak&quot; are commonly used to refer to business audio services that provide background music in retail settings.

==History==
Founded in 1934, Muzak was among the early background music providers.

Business audio is produced off-site and delivered to the client via a number of methods including DBS satellite, SDARS satellite, coaxial cable, FM radio subcarrier, leased line, internet broadband, compact disc, and tape.

Most audio content is licensed for personal and home use only. Business audio services allow clients to use audio content in public and commercial settings by paying appropriate royalties to performing rights organizations like ASCAP, BMI, SESAC and GEMA in Germany.

===Historical devices===
* The 1959 Seeburg 1000 was a stack record player, playing both sides continuous and repeating up to 1000 songs and up to 25 special 9&quot; vinyl records with a 2&quot; center bore at 16⅔ RPM.
* The Rowe Customusic was an endless tape cartridge player, loading simultaneous six C-type Fidelipac cartridges. 
* The 1964 3M Cantata 700 played continuous and auto-reversing one of its large and proprietary magnetic tape cartridges, containing up to 26 hours of music.
* Rediffusion’s Reditune system was popular in the 1960s UK.

<text>Hollingworth is a village in the Tameside district, in Greater Manchester, England. It is about 11 miles (19 km) east of Manchester, on the Derbyshire border near Hadfield. It lies within the historic county boundaries of Cheshire, and became part of Greater Manchester in 1974. It gave its name to a family who owned much of the surrounding area from before the time of the Norman conquest.

==Toponymy==
Hollingworth was recorded &quot;Holisvrde&quot; before 1059 and in 1086. Its name is derived from the Old English &quot;holegn,&quot; for holly and &quot;worð&quot; an enclosure. In 1059, Hollingworth was surrounded by dense forests.

==History==

===Early history===
An ancient pagan religious site known as Wedneshough Green was in Hollingworth. A grassy knoll opposite the Gunn Inn was anciently called &quot;Wedenshaw&quot; or &quot;Woden&#x27;s Hawe&quot; after the pagan god Woden. The region was populated by Celts, the Pecsaetans a southern branch of the Brigantes. The group became a distinct ethnic tribe in the Mercian Kingdom of the West Angles. The tribes living in the Longdendale valley were pagans until around 627AD when the surrounding districts started converting to Christianity.

Hollingworth was in the ancient Hundred of Hamestan before 1000 AD which is believed to be the ancient boundaries of the Pecsaetan tribesmen. After the Norman conquest in 1086, the Hundred of Hamestan was redefined and renamed the Macclesfield Hundred.

===Manor===
Hollingworth was an ancient manor governed by a local lord. Members of a single family, the Hollingworths, were lords of the manor for more than 700 years. In this part of Cheshire, local lords assumed the name of their manor as their surname. Some were granted arms by the Earl of Chester. The family&#x27;s ancient arms are three holly leaves.


In 1059 when the Saxons ruled Cheshire, Hollingworth was held by a freeman who owed his rights to his senior lord; Edwin the Earl of Chester. Edwin was the chief lord of all the manors in the Hamestan Hundred. He leased the manor of Hollingworth to a freeman and his descendants for an annual rent and military service. In 1059, Hollingworth had 30 acres of productive farmland. The Saxon freeman in possession of the manor was removed sometime before 1086 by the Normans.

After the Norman conquest of England, Earl Edwin&#x27;s lands were forfeited. The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; in 1086 shows that Hollingworth manor was barren and worthless. Paul Howson and William Booth wrote that &#x27;No population is recorded for the area covered by the later forest of Macclesfield or the Lordship of Longdendale ...&#x27;. The Lordship of Longdendale was a term that came into common use around 1359, to describe a parcel of manors which includes Hollingworth. The wholesale ejectment of the Saxons from manors in Longdendale appears to have specific to those lands under the control of Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester. He replaced the Saxon freeman on the Cheshire side of Longdendale with Normans and Saxon farmers under the control of a local Saxon chieftain called Wulfric (pronounced Uluric). On the Derbyshire side of Longdendale, which was controlled by the king, many ancient Saxon families remained in control of their lands.
The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; shows that Hollingworth was held by the Earl of Chester with no local lord in control of the manor. The Saxon chieftain Wulfric managed manors in Longdendale on behalf of the Earl of Chester. Heavily wooded and dangerous because of wolves in the forests, Hollingworth and the manors of Mottram, Matley, Tintwistle and Stayley appear to have been wilderness until 1211. By 1140 local farmers assumed the name of their manor as their surname. Sometime before 1211, Sir William De Neville (De NovaVilla), took up residence at Bucton Castle in Tintwistle, and was installed as over-lord to manage the local lords in possession of Hollingworth, Wolley, Broadbottom, Hattersley, Wernet, Matley, Stayley, Mottram-in-Longdendale and Tintwistle.

In 1211, William De Neville gave his son-in-law, Thomas de Burgh or Burgo, control of all the manors in Longdendale as the supreme over-lord. Around 1222, Thomas de Burgh took the neighbouring manor of Godley from Albinus and gave it to Adam, son of Reginald de Bredbury. Witness to this deed was a &#x27;Tomas de Holinwurthe&#x27;.

The earliest recorded Hollingworths are Tomas de Holinwurthe circa 1222, 1246; and Henry de Holenwart in 1222. The ancient manor of Hollingworth including the minor manors of Thorncliffe and Wolley was held by the de Holynworths of Hollingworth Hall by &#x27;knight&#x27;s service&#x27;. By 1359, the manor was owned by different scions of the Hollingworth family. Greater Hollingworth was owned by the senior branch living at Hollingworth Hall. Little Hollingworth was inherited by a younger brother who lived at Old Mottram Hall; he married the heiress to Matley Hall. A younger sister held a share of Thorncliffe Manor, also called Little Hollingworth manor, and was at Thorncliffe Hall in 1359.

The ancient family of Hollingworth migrated to Devon, London, Lincoln, Maidstone in Kent and Dale Abbey in Derbyshire. A pedigree for the family shows they descended in a continuous male line from the Lords of Hollingworth to the present day.

Hollingworth Hall is no longer standing, but the family&#x27;s chapel remains.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering Hollingworth, at metropolitan borough level: Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council. The council is a member of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, which is led by the directly-elected Mayor of Greater Manchester. Hollingworth forms part of the Longdendale ward of Tameside.

===Administrative history===
Hollingworth was historically a township in the ancient parish of Mottram-in-Longdendale, which formed part of the Macclesfield Hundred of Cheshire. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Mottram-in-Longdendale, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Hollingworth became a civil parish.

The Hollingworth township was made a local government district in 1863, administered by an elected local board. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. In 1913, the council moved its headquarters to Albion Lodge (now called Albion House) on the street called Mottram Moor.

Hollingworth Urban District was abolished in 1936 to become part of the new Longdendale Urban District. In 1931 (the last census before the abolition of the parish and urban district), Hollingworth had a population of 2,299. Longdendale Urban District was in turn abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside in Greater Manchester.

==Geography==
Hollingworth lies in the valley of Longdendale, on the north bank of the River Etherow, which forms the county boundary with Derbyshire. Hollingworth is classed as part of the built-up area of Hadfield, on the south bank of the Etherow, by the Office for National Statistics.

==Transport==
The village is served by the A628 road (leading to the Woodhead pass to Barnsley) and the A57 road (leading to the Snake Pass to Sheffield). Going west, the A57 joins the M67 motorway a couple of miles from the village.

Hollingworth is also served by Stagecoach Bus Service 237 from Glossop to Ashton-under-Lyne, passing every 30 minutes until 6pm then every hour thereafter.

==Education==
There are two schools in Hollingworth: 
* Hollingworth Primary and Nursery School, for children up to aged 11
* Longdendale High School, a comprehensive school for children aged 11–16.

==Culture and community==
*Hollingworth Cricket Club plays in the Derbyshire and Cheshire League.
*Hollingworth Brass Band rehearses at Longdendale Community Language College.
*Etherow Bowling Club is located just off the Boulevard at the bottom of Taylor Street. They have 6 teams (5 Men&#x27;s &amp; 1 Ladies&#x27;) who play Crown Green Bowls.
*1st Longdendale Scouts troop night is held at the Cannon Street Community Centre weekly.

==Notable people==
*Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood (1941–2022) was born at 6, Millbrook in the village.

<doc id="518342" wikidata="Q756368" url="?curid=518342" title="SS Atlantic Conveyor">
<text>Atlantic Conveyor was a British merchant navy ship, registered in Liverpool, that was requisitioned during the Falklands War.

She was hit on 25 May 1982 by two Argentine air-launched AM39 Exocet missiles, killing 12 sailors. &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; sank whilst under tow on 28 May 1982.

The wrecksite is designated under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.

==History==

&quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; was a 14,950 ton roll-on, roll-off container ship owned by Cunard. She was built along with six other container ships, each named with the prefix &quot;Atlantic&quot;, and each sailing under different national flags by different companies for the Atlantic Container Line consortium.

Along with her sister ship, &quot;Atlantic Causeway&quot;, &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; was requisitioned by the Ministry of Defence at the beginning of the Falklands War through the STUFT (ship taken up from trade) system. Because of the short time available, the decision that the ship was not &quot;a high-value unit&quot;, and a controversy over whether arming auxiliaries was legal, &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; was not fitted with either an active or a passive defence system.

The ships were used to carry supplies for the Royal Navy Task Force sent by the British government to retake the Falkland Islands from Argentine occupation. Sailing for Ascension Island on 25 April 1982, &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; carried a cargo of six Wessex helicopters from 848 Naval Air Squadron and five RAF Chinook HC.1s from No. 18 Squadron RAF. At Ascension, she picked up eight Fleet Air Arm Sea Harriers (809 Squadron) and six RAF Harrier GR.3 jump jets.

One Chinook of B flight No. 18 Squadron RAF left &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; to support operations on Ascension. With the aircraft stored she then set sail for the South Atlantic. On arrival off the Falklands in mid-May, all of the Harriers were off-loaded to the carriers; the GR.3s going to HMS &quot;Hermes&quot; while the Sea Harriers were divided amongst the existing squadrons on &quot;Hermes&quot; and HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;. With the additional aircraft on &quot;Hermes&quot; a Lynx HAS.2 helicopter was flown and parked on &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; on 20 May 1982.

On 25 May 1982 (the same day as the loss of HMS &quot;Coventry&quot;) &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; was hit by two AM39 Air Launched Exocet missiles fired by two Argentine Navy Super Étendard jet fighters. The mission was led by Corvette Captain Roberto Curilovic (call sign &#x27;Tito&#x27;), flying Super Etendard 0753/3-A-203, and his wingman, Warship Lieutenant Julio Barraza, (call sign &#x27;Leo&#x27;) flying in 0754/3-A-204—both from 2da Escuadrilla Aeronaval de Caza y Ataque.

Both Exocets struck &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; on the port quarter of the ship. There are conflicting accounts on whether the warheads exploded after penetrating the ship&#x27;s hull, or on impact. Witness Prince Andrew reported that debris caused &quot;splashes in the water about a quarter of a mile away&quot;. He said that the incident &quot;was an experience I shall never forget ... horrific&quot;. All the survivors were taken to HMS &quot;Hermes&quot;.

Because both fuel and ammunition were stored below decks, the incendiary effect of the unburnt propellant from the missiles caused an uncontrollable fire. When the fire had burnt out, the ship was boarded but nothing was recovered. While under tow by the requisitioned tug &quot;Irishman&quot;, &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; sank in the early morning of 28 May 1982. Six Westland Wessexes, three Boeing Chinooks, and a Westland Lynx were destroyed by fire; only one Chinook (ZA718 &#x27;Bravo November&#x27;) and one Westland Wessex, were saved. The loss of these helicopters meant that British troops had to march on foot across the Falklands to recapture Stanley.

Twelve men died in &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot;, including the ship&#x27;s master, Captain Ian Harry North, who was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). The ship was the first British merchant vessel lost at sea to enemy fire since World War II.

The ship&#x27;s replacement was built on Tyneside.

==Crew==

The vessel carried a Merchant Navy crew of 33. This included 12 officers (master, chief officer, second officer, third officer, radio officer, chief engineer, second engineer, two third engineers, fourth engineer, electrician and purser), 10 petty officers (bosun, four mechanics, two first cooks, second cook and baker, second cook and second steward) and 11 ratings (five seamen, three greasers and three assistant stewards). Of the 12 men killed in the sinking of &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; six were from the Merchant Navy, three from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary and three sailors from the Royal Navy.

As the last resting place of the remains of those who died, the wreck is designated as a &quot;protected place&quot; under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.

The officers&#x27; bar on M/V &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot;, built 1984 in Swan Hunter, Wallsend is named &quot;The North Bar&quot; after Captain Ian North.

<text>Flowery Field is an area of Hyde, Greater Manchester, England. It is a mainly residential area once dominated by Ashton Brothers&#x27;s textile mill.

==Cricket==
The area is home to Flowery Field Cricket Club. An early member for them was Warren Bradley, who later played football for Manchester United.

==Education==
Schools in the area include Hyde High School and Flowery Field Primary School and Nursery.

Hyde Community College is a secondary school in the area. It is noted for its ICT teaching. The school has a rich history in the area and has been on its current site since the 1940s. As part of the governments building schools for the future programme, the school was completely rebuilt and was opened in November 2012.

Flowery Field infants and junior schools are now in a combined building on the original site which opened in January 2015.

== Transport ==
Flowery Field railway station is located on the Glossop line. Trains run in each direction at least twice per hour. In the peak times this increases to 3 or 4 every hour in each direction.

Another station nearby, Hyde North, accommodates the Manchester Piccadilly to Rose Hill Marple line, which runs slightly less regularly than the Glossop line. There is no service from Hyde North on Sundays and in the evenings after 8:30 PM.

Buses include the 330 Stockport to Ashton via Hyde and Woodley, Greater Manchester. This service is run by Stagecoach Manchester and operates every eight mins each way, 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM Monday to Saturday and every twenty mins each way on Sundays and evenings past 8:00 PM.

The 343 runs from Hyde to Stalybridge via Dukinfield. This service is run by Stotts Coaches and Stagecoach Manchester and operates every sixty mins each way every day from 7:30 AM to 11:30 PM.

==Facilities==
Flowery Field Church is a Tudor Gothic-style building, designed by the architect Thomas Worthington, and was completed in 1878. Thomas Ashton (who owned the cotton mill across the road) built the church at his own expense and donated it to the congregation as a sacred trust. During the build the congregation were tasked with raising £1000, which was a huge amount at that time. Upon completion Thomas Ashton then made a magnificent gesture by returning this sum on condition that the money be invested and the interest used to augment a Minister&#x27;s stipend. The church still has weekly services and an active social calendar, and is open to any denomination as a Free Christian Fellowship.

<doc id="518358" wikidata="Q2367101" url="?curid=518358" title="Brown hair">
<text>Brown hair, also referred to as brunette (when female), is the second-most common human hair color, after black hair. It varies from light brown to dark hair. It is characterized by higher levels of the dark pigment eumelanin and lower levels of the pale pigment pheomelanin.

Brown hair is common among populations in the Western world, especially among those from Northwestern Europe and the United States, as well as populations in Central Europe, Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, Southern Cone, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, and also some populations in the Middle East, Central Asia where it transitions smoothly into black hair. Additionally, brown hair is common among Australian Aboriginals and Melanesians.

==Etymology and grammar==
The term &quot;brunette&quot; is the feminine form of the French word &quot;brunet&quot;, which is a diminutive form of &quot;brun&quot; meaning &quot;brown/brown-haired&quot;, the feminine of which is &quot;brune&quot;. All of these terms ultimately derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;bhrūn-&quot; &quot;brown, grey&quot;. The form &quot;brun&quot; (pronounced ) is still commonly used in Scotland, particularly in rural areas, and is also the word for &quot;brown&quot; in the Scandinavian languages. In modern English usage, however, it has lost the diminutive meaning and usually refers to any brown-haired girl or woman, or the associated hair color. &quot;Merriam-Webster&quot; defines &quot;brunet&quot; as &quot;a person having brown hair&quot;—with which they may have &quot;a relatively dark complexion—spelled brunet when used of a boy or man and usually brunette when used of a girl or woman&quot;. Although &quot;brunet&quot; is the masculine version of the popular diminutive form used to describe a little boy or young man with brown hair, the use of &quot;brunet&quot; is uncommon in English. One is more likely to say about a man or boy, &quot;He has brown hair&quot; or &quot;He is brown-haired&quot; than to say, &quot;He is a brunette&quot; (or brunet).

Lighter or darker shades of brown hair may be referred to as &quot;light brunette&quot; or &quot;dark brunette&quot;, though in such cases one is generally referring only to the hair color, not using the term as a descriptor for the person; one would be unlikely to say, &quot;She is a light brunette.&quot; Rather, one would say, &quot;She has light-brown hair.&quot;

==Geographic distribution==
Brown-haired individuals predominate in most parts of Europe. In northern and central Europe medium to light brown shades are the most common, while darker shades prevail in the rest of the continent. Brown hair, mostly medium to light brown shades, are also dominant in Australia, Canada, South Africa among White South Africans and the United States among European Americans from the Northern, Central and Eastern European (British, Scandinavian, Baltic, Dutch/Flemish, German (including Swiss-German and Austrian), Slovenian, Polish, Ukrainian and Russian) as well as Southern (Italian, Spanish, Greek, Portuguese) and Southeastern European (Bulgarian, Croatian, Serbian).

Similarly to blond hair, brown hair occurs commonly among Australian Aboriginal and Melanesian populations.

Dark brown hair is predominant in the Mediterranean parts of Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia, and South Asia. Very dark brown hair, easily mistaken for black hair, can be found occasionally in parts of East Asia. This is also true of Southern Cone of South America (Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, central-southern Brazil), Colombia, Andean Region of Venezuela, Costa Rican Central Valley and Puerto Rico.

A study of 1,023 students in Chile found that the most common eye color was brown-black: 71 to 89.4% and the most common hair color was brown from 65.8% to 66.8%.

In Spain, 57% are brown (7% of Spaniards are naturally blonde, 26% brunette, 3% redhead and the remaining 10% dark and light brown).

Dark brown hair also may occasionally be found among Indigenous Americans and Siberians; (formerly) especially for mostly populations in Southeast Asia due to pigment changes (such as the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam) for example particularly when they are young, as well as in many other groups.

==Biochemistry==
The pigment eumelanin gives brown hair its distinctive color. Brown hair has more eumelanin than blond hair but also has far less than black. There are two different types of eumelanin, which are distinguished from each other by their pattern of polymer bonds. The two types are black eumelanin and brown eumelanin. Black eumelanin is the darkest; brown eumelanin is much lighter than black. A small amount of black eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes grey hair. A small amount of brown eumelanin without any other pigments causes yellow (blond) color hair. Often, natural blond or red hair will darken to a brown color over time. Brown-haired people have medium-thick strands of hair.

Brown-haired people are thought to produce more skin-protecting eumelanin and are associated with having a more even skin tone. The range of skin colors associated with brown hair is vast, ranging from the palest of skin tones to a dark olive complexion.

==Varieties of brown hair==
Brown hair comes in a wide variety of shades from the very darkest of brown (almost black) to lightest brown (almost blond) showing small signs of blondism. Shades of brown hair include:

* deepest brunette: the darkest brown, which can be a very dark chocolate; sometimes appears to be off-black at a distance, and is often considered to be black.
* dark brown
* milk chocolate brown
* dark chestnut brown
* light chestnut brown
* medium brown: standard brunette, comparable to Russet brown
* walnut brown: a warmer variant of medium brown, comparable to a light chestnut
* caramel brown: warm brown tone.
* light golden brown : the lightest brown, almost dirty blond
* mousy: a dull light brown color, sometimes seen as a dirty blond
* light ash brown: almost blond hair 
* auburn brown: reddish-brown hair
* lightest brown: light brown that goes mid blonde in the sun
* maple brown: a dark golden brown color, like maple syrup
==Culture==

===Cultural connotations===
In Western popular culture, a common stereotype is that brunettes are stable, serious, smart and sophisticated. According to &quot;Allure&quot; magazine, in 2005, 76 percent of American women believed that the first female president of the United States will have brown hair.

===Modern fiction===
Anita Loos, the author of the novel and play &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;, wrote a sequel entitled &quot;But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes&quot;. A film of this was made, &quot;Gentlemen Marry Brunettes&quot;, starring Jane Russell and Jeanne Crain.

===Art and fiction===
The Lady of Shalott from Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s poem is depicted as a brunette in most paintings. The woman portrayed in Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s most well-known painting, &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, is brunette. In the French folk song &quot;Au clair de la lune&quot;, the likable Lubin visits his brunette neighbor at Pierrot&#x27;s suggestion. In the Irish song &quot;The Star of the County Down&quot; the narrator falls in love with a woman with &quot;nut-brown&quot; hair, called Rose McCann.

=== Rivalry with blondes ===
In popular culture, brunettes may be portrayed as being in a rivalry or competition with blonde women. The rivalry may take the form of competitive sports or as part of a love triangle in which a blonde and a brunette woman compete for the affections of a man.

<text>Audenshaw is a town in Tameside, Greater Manchester, England, east of Manchester. Historically part of Lancashire, in 2011 it had a population of 11,419.

The name derives from Aldwin, a Saxon personal name, and the Old English suffix &quot;shagh&quot; meaning &quot;Woodland&quot;. Nico Ditch, an early-medieval linear earthwork possibly built as a defensive barrier against Vikings, runs through the area. Medieval Audenshaw was a division of the township of Ashton in the county of Lancashire. Audenshaw expanded as a centre for textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian era with inhabitants employed in hat-making, cotton-spinning, calico-printing, and silk-weaving. In 1974, Audenshaw Urban District became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside.

==History==

The name Audenshaw is a corruption of its earlier name &quot;Aldwinshagh&quot; which derives from Aldwin, a Saxon personal name, combined with the Old English suffix &quot;shagh&quot; meaning &quot;Woodland&quot;.

Nico Ditch, a medieval linear earthwork, runs through the area. Stretching from Ashton Moss in the east to just east of Stretford in the west, the origin of the ditch is unclear. According to legend, it was completed in a single night by the inhabitants of Manchester, as a protection against Viking invaders in 869–870, and that it was the site of a bloody battle between Saxons and Danes and that Gorton and Reddish got their name from the battle, &quot;Gore Town&quot; and &quot;Red-Ditch&quot;. Despite the legend, the U-shape of the ditch – as opposed to the usual V-shape of military earthworks – and the absence of an associated bank indicates that Nico Ditch was probably a boundary marker. Although it is thought to be earlier, the earliest documented reference to Nico Ditch is in a charter detailing the granting of land in Audenshaw to the monks of the Kersal Cell. In the document, dating from 1190 to 1212, the ditch is referred to as &quot;Mykelldiche&quot;, and a magnum fossatum, Latin for &quot;large ditch&quot;.

In 1877, part of the original village of Audenshaw was demolished to make way for the three Audenshaw Reservoirs. Also destroyed to allow the construction of the reservoirs was a section of Nico Ditch.

==Governance==

During the Early Middle Ages Audenshaw is supposed to have been a
thanage held by Saxons, but following the Norman conquest of England fell within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire, and noted as a division of Ashton, an ancient township and parish within the hundred of Salford. The division of Audenshaw spanned the village of Audenshaw, and the outlying settlements of Danehead, Hooleyhill, Littlemoss, North-street, Walkmill, Waterhouses and Woodhouses. This arrangement persisted until the creation of Audenshaw&#x27;s first local authority, a local board of health in 1870. Audenshaw Local Board of Health was a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the locality. Under the Local Government Act 1894, the area of the local board became the Audenshaw Urban District, a local government district in the Ashton-under-Lyne Poor Law Union and administrative county of Lancashire. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Audenshaw Urban District was abolished, and Audenshaw has, since 1 April 1974, formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside, within the Metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.

Audenshaw was previously represented in Parliament by the Denton and Reddish constituency. Since its creation in 1983, the constituency has been held by the Labour Party, 
At (53.4743°, −2.1122°), north-northwest of central London and east of Manchester, Audenshaw stands at the head of the Dane valley. Guide Bridge is an area of Audenshaw.

Since the 2023 review of Westminster constituencies, Audenshaw has been represented by Angela Rayner of the Labour Party as part of the Ashton-under-Lyne constituency. In the 2024 United Kingdom general election, her majority over the second-placed Reform UK candidate was 6,971.
Audenshaw is an electoral ward of Tameside, England.

The ward is represented by three councillors: Oliver Ryan (Lab), Maria Bailey (Lab), and Teresa Smith (Lab)
 indicates seat up for re-election.

<text>Hattersley is a housing estate in the Tameside district of Greater Manchester, England. It is located east of the town centre of Hyde, west of Glossop and east of Manchester, at the eastern terminus of the M67. The estate has Hyde postal addresses, but is classed as a separate built-up area by the Office for National Statistics; the Hattersley built-up area had a population of 6,960 at the 2021 census. It lies within the historic county boundaries of Cheshire, and became part of Greater Manchester in 1974. Although outside the city boundaries of Manchester, the area was developed as a large overspill estate by Manchester City Council from the 1960s onwards.

==History==
Hattersley was historically a township in the ancient parish of Mottram-in-Longdendale, which formed part of the Macclesfield Hundred of Cheshire. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Mottram-in-Longdendale, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Hattersley became a civil parish.

When elected parish and district councils were created in 1894, Hattersley was included in the Tintwistle Rural District. The parish was too small to qualify for a parish council, and so was given a parish meeting instead. The parish was abolished in 1936. Its former area was split between the neighbouring borough of Hyde and the new Longdendale Urban District. At the 1931 census (the last before the abolition of the parish), Hattlersley had a population of 280.

===Construction of the estate===

At the beginning of the 1960s, most of the area was purchased by Manchester City Council to build a large overspill estate, which became home to many families rehoused from inner-city slum areas like Gorton. Another similar estate was built in Gamesley. Both these estates consist primarily of council houses.

===Renewal and privatisation===
Regeneration in Hattersley is coordinated by Hattersley Neighbourhood Partnership.
The city council transferred control of most of Hattersley&#x27;s housing stock to Peak Valley Housing Association in 2006 after an attempt to transfer it to the Harvest Housing Group which collapsed when a £20 million gap in funding to refurbish the homes to new housing standards was identified. The transfer brought a £40 million, seven-year improvement plan for existing housing tied to a £140m investment from a private developer.

Selective demolition has begun to remove some obsolete housing leaving space for redevelopment and investment in education and public services. Seven tower blocks were demolished in 2001. Demolition of some of the 1960s low-rise houses on the estate took place in 2007 and 2008, these houses having deteriorated to a condition where refurbishment was not viable, in spite of these houses being just over 40 years old.

In 2012 a Tesco supermarket was opened, despite residents&#x27; concern about extra traffic.

===Moors Murders===

Moors murderer Myra Hindley and her grandmother Ellen Maybury, together with Hindley&#x27;s boyfriend Ian Brady, were rehoused in Hattersley from Gorton in 1964 and lived at a new council house in the area – 16 Wardle Brook Avenue – for approximately 12 months until Hindley and Brady were arrested in October 1965. They had already carried out three murders, at that time still undetected, before they moved to Hattersley.

Brady spent much of his time at the house with Hindley and together they carried out their final two killings – that of 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey on Boxing Day 1964, and 17-year-old Edward Evans in October 1965 – at the house; they had already committed three murders while living in Gorton. 

The body of Lesley Ann Downey was buried on nearby Saddleworth Moor the day after her murder on Boxing Day 1964, and found there during the initial search of the moors nearly a year later, but the body of Edward Evans was found locked in a bedroom at the house before the couple could dispose of it; the police then went on to find the evidence to link Brady and Hindley to the earlier murders. Brady and Hindley were sentenced to life imprisonment in May 1966, both remaining in custody until their deaths.

In October 1987, Manchester City Council demolished the house as they could not find tenants willing to live there. The site of the house remains vacant, although the surrounding houses remain standing.

===Dale Cregan===

On 18 September 2012, drug dealer Dale Cregan made a hoax emergency call to the police from an address in Mottram, luring Police Constables Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, of Greater Manchester Police there by claiming that there had been an incident of criminal damage. When they arrived, he ambushed the constables, shooting them and throwing an M75 hand grenade at them. Both officers were hit by at least eight bullets as Cregan fired 32 shots in 31 seconds. He later turned himself in at Hyde police station and was charged with their murders.

==Community and regeneration==
Hattersley had a monthly community newspaper, the &quot;Hattersley &amp; Mottram Community News&quot;, produced by local people; it ceased publication in 2011, after Tameside Council ended its funding. It is home to no. 468 (Hyde and Hatterley) Squadron Air Cadets.

Hattersley is now home to both a brand-new community hub and a library. Many new developments have been important in kick-starting the regeneration of the Hattersley district; these include new housing, a large Tesco Extra superstore and &quot;Adventure Longdendale&quot; (a trampolining, Laser Quest and play centre). There are also plans for Hattersley Retail Park; this was originally scheduled to open in 2021, but has faced multiple setbacks.

==Transport==

Hattersley railway station serves the area; it is on the Glossop line between Manchester Piccadilly, Glossop and Hadfield. There is a generally half-hourly service in both directions, operated by Northern Trains.

Bus services are provided by Stagecoach Manchester. There are frequent services to Manchester city centre on route 201.

==Notable people==
*Ricky Hatton, the former two-weight world champion boxer, grew up on the estate.
*Shayne Ward, from Hattersley, was on &quot;The X Factor&quot;.

<text>Leigham is the name of an area of the city of Plymouth in the English county of Devon.

Originally a hamlet and manor separate from the city, urban expansion of the 20th century has meant that the area has become widely built up. The area is located to the north east of Plymouth itself.

The place name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;an open space in a wood&#x27;. In the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 it was referred to as &quot;Leaham&quot; and was recorded as consisting of the manor and two farms.

Unfortunately the ancient manor house is no longer there: it fell into disrepair following the Second World War. In the late Summer of 1946 Plymouth City Council bought the Leigham Manor Estate as part of its redevelopment plan for the City. 

Leigham was in the parish of Plympton St Mary but is now in the parish of Estover, which itself was carved out of the manorial estate in the 1970s.

He featured in three World Cup tournaments in 1996, 1999 and 2003. During his playing days, he formed a rivalry against former Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar whenever Zimbabwe and India played against each other in international cricket. He was also regarded as Zimbabwe cricket&#x27;s poster boy.

He was considered one of the fastest bowlers in international cricket, but also one of the more inaccurate, bowling many wides and no-balls. His international career came to an end in 2003 after Olonga and teammate Andy Flower wore black armbands during an international cricket match in the 2003 Cricket World Cup to &quot;mourn the death of democracy&quot; in Zimbabwe. Death threats forced him to live in exile in England. Olonga announced his retirement from international cricket after Zimbabwe&#x27;s final game in the 2003 World Cup at the age of 26 when he was in the prime years of his career. Olonga and Flower were given honorary life membership of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) later in 2003. He and Flower were also honoured by the Cricket Writer&#x27;s Club during the annual dinner where they were conferred with the Peter Smith Memorial Award, an award which is given as an annual acknowledgement of outstanding contributions to the game of cricket.

==Early life==
Olonga was born in Lusaka, Zambia. His father John Olonga was a Kenyan surgeon and his mother was Zimbabwean. He has two sisters and two brothers as well as ten half-brothers and sisters from his father&#x27;s first marriage. Olonga, in his autobiography, reveled how his parents had to be separated temporarily when he was just four years old when his mother learned that her husband had hidden his first marriage from her. One of his brothers, Victor Olonga, played professional rugby and became captain of the Zimbabwe national team. His uncle is the former Kenyan minister Francis Masakhalia.

Soon after his birth, his family had returned to Kenya. After returning to Kenya, the family then moved to Bulawayo in Zimbabwe as his father intended to provide and ensure access to higher quality education for his children. Olonga was educated at Rhodes Estate Preparatory School (REPS) and began playing cricket at the age of eight and also played cricket for the Partridges, the Zimbabwe national primary schools cricket team. He then attended Plumtree School, where he became head boy. He was involved in acting, athletics and rugby in addition to cricket. He was nominated as one of the finalists in the search hunt for Zimbabwe&#x27;s best high school actor for his performance as Charlie Davenport (a character which featured in the film 1950 film Annie Get Your Gun) while he was still the head boy.

In a school cricket match against Brighton College, he scored 103 runs and took 8 wickets for 15 runs. He found a firm Christian faith in 1992 at a youth camp in Marondera. He was also selected to play for Matabeleland in national primary schools cricket week.

==Domestic career==
Olonga made his debut in first-class cricket in March 1994, aged 17, playing for Matabeleland against Mashonaland in the Logan Cup at Harare Sports Club. He took five wickets in the match, but had varied performances over the next couple of years. He continued to play domestic first-class cricket for Matabeleland until 1998–99 and then for Mashonaland A in 2001–02. Olonga later played for Manicaland in 2002–03.

==International career==
He was not an obvious or automatic choice when he was selected to make his international debut for Zimbabwe in the Test against Pakistan in Harare in January 1995 (although Olonga could have been selected to play for Zimbabwe against Sri Lanka earlier in 1995, when David Brain and Eddo Brandes were absent due to injury, but he was found to be ineligible as he still held Kenyan nationality). It was revealed that his father was against Olonga&#x27;s decision to pursue his career in cricket and wanted him to compete at the Olympics representing Kenya. However, Olonga refused his father&#x27;s interest and did not give up his cricket ambitions. Having given up his Kenyan citizenship, Olonga became the youngest player to represent Zimbabwe in international cricket, aged 18 years and 212 days. He grew up watching the likes of Malcolm Marshall and Allan Donald and consider them as his childhood idols.

A right arm fast bowler, Olonga was also the first black cricketer to play for Zimbabwe and the third Zambian-born Test cricketer after Phil Edmonds and Neal Radford of England. Zimbabwe beat Pakistan by an innings and 64 runs, the team&#x27;s first ever Test victory, mainly due to a double century from Grant Flower, as well as centuries from Andy Flower and Guy Whittall. Olonga took the wicket of Saeed Anwar in his first over, but he was no-balled once for throwing. With help from Dennis Lillee, he rebuilt his action at the MRF Pace Foundation before returning to international cricket. He was overlooked from Zimbabwe squad for the 1998 Commonwealth Games in September 1998. Thereafter, he began training harder with fellow seamer Heath Streak and got into the national team after remodelling his bowling action.

He made his debut in ODIs playing against South Africa in October 1995. He was man of the match when he took his first 5-wicket haul (5–70) in Tests, playing against India in October 1998, Zimbabwe&#x27;s second Test victory. He was also the spearhead of the team that won Zimbabwe&#x27;s first overseas Test, beating Pakistan in Peshawar in November 1998. Olonga took a second and final Test 5-wicket haul (5–93) in a losing cause against Pakistan in November 2002.

He played 30 Test matches for Zimbabwe, taking 68 wickets with a bowling average of 38.52. Olonga also played 50 One Day Internationals as well, taking 58 wickets at an average of 34.08. He holds the record for the best bowling in an ODI by a Zimbabwean, with figures of 6–19 against England in Cape Town in 2000.

===Cricket World Cups===
Olonga joined the Zimbabwe team at the 1996 Cricket World Cup in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. He was selected to play in Zimbabwe&#x27;s final game of the competition, against India, but asked to be omitted as he was out of practice. He played in 7 matches in the 1999 Cricket World Cup in England. He was best known for his bowling spell against India at the 1999 Cricket World Cup where he took three wickets in the final over of the group stage match and eventually Zimbabwe created a massive upset by defeating India by a close margin of three runs. It was also Zimbabwe&#x27;s first ever win against India in a World Cup match.

He was selected for the Zimbabwe team at the 2003 Cricket World Cup, held in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya. Some of the countries playing in the tournament were concerned about security: New Zealand had refused to play in Nairobi and England refused to play in Harare.

==Controversy==
Olonga and his teammate Andy Flower achieved international recognition by wearing a black armband in the match against Namibia at Harare Sports Club, to &quot;mourn the death of democracy&quot; in Zimbabwe under the government led by Robert Mugabe. Olonga and Flower released a statement on 10 February 2003, the second day of the tournament, stating in part:

Flower scored 39 runs, Olonga conceded 8 runs from 3 overs but took no wickets as Zimbabwe won the match. Their protest was supported in the world press and more widely internationally, but caused a political storm in Zimbabwe. The minister of information Jonathan Moyo labelled Olonga an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; with &quot;a black skin and a white mask&quot;.

Despite the protest, Flower continued to play for Zimbabwe in the tournament, but Olonga was omitted from the team for six matches, ostensibly on grounds of his poor form (including a walkover against England who refused to travel to Harare). Olonga was selected to play in one more World Cup match, against Kenya in Bloemfontein in the Super Sixes stage of the tournament on 12 March. He was also expelled by the Takashinga Cricket Club branding him as &quot;traitor&quot; and it was revealed that his girlfriend also eventually broke up with him in a mail.

A warrant was issued in Zimbabwe for Olonga&#x27;s arrest on charges of treason. Death threats made him go temporarily into hiding and then into exile in England after Zimbabwe&#x27;s last match of the tournament, against Sri Lanka in East London. A knee injury forced his retirement from first-class cricket later in 2003, but he has played occasional matches since 2005 for the Lashings World XI. By 2010, he was calling for the restoration of international cricket between Zimbabwe and other countries.

== Beyond cricket ==
Olonga met physical education teacher Tara Read while both were attending the Australian Institute of Sport&#x27;s cricket program in Adelaide. The couple married in 2004. Olonga had lived in exile in Britain for 12 years from 2003 to 2015 and then moved to Australia in 2015 along with his wife and his two children. His Zimbabwean passport was expired in 2006 when he was living in exile in England and he could not leave England for another nine years. In 2023 he became an Australian citizen. In 2001, he composed the lyrics for the song &quot;Our Zimbabwe&quot;. He was also nicknamed as &quot;Singing Seamer&quot; by the English press following the release of &quot;Our Zimbabwe&quot; song.

On Friday 13 October 2006, Olonga won &quot;Five&#x27;s&quot; &quot;The All Star Talent Show&quot; with 50% of the overall votes.

He is now pursuing a career as a cricket commentator and singer and released an album &quot;Aurelia&quot; in 2006. His autobiography, &quot;Blood, Sweat and Treason&quot;, was released in July 2010 by Vision Sports Publishing and was longlisted for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year 2010. In addition, he also served as a public speaker, photographer, art worker and author. After composing music, he made his singing debut in 2016 in a charity event performing &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

In 2019, he entered as a contestant on the eight season of The Voice Australia and performed Anthony Warlow&#x27;s album &quot;This Is the Moment!&quot; in the audition&quot;.&quot; He got three chair turn from Delta Goodrem, Boy George and Kelly Rowland. He chose Kelly Rowland as his coach and was eliminated in the Battle rounds. He was eliminated from the Voice Australia show after forgetting the lyrics of Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Can You Feel the Love&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Sportstar&quot;, he revealed that his singing career is his second innings of his life.

In August 2019, he joined the fundraiser of the African AIDS Foundation to raise funds for the organisation. He was appointed as global ambassador for Anglican Aid.

<doc id="518386" wikidata="Q1073785" url="?curid=518386" title="Valarin">
<text>Valarin is a fictional language in the fantasy works of J. R. R. Tolkien. One of the languages of Arda in Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth legendarium, Valarin is the language spoken by the Valar. As immortal spiritual beings, the Valar have the ability to communicate through thought, with no need for a spoken language, but it appears that it was adopted as part of their assumption of physical, humanlike forms.

== External history ==

Tolkien at first decided that Valarin, the tongue of the Valar as it is called in the Elvish language Quenya, would be the proto-language of the Elves, the tongue Oromë taught to the speechless Elves. He then developed the Valarin tongue and a grammar for it in the early 1930s. In the 1940s, he decided to drop that idea, and the tongue he had developed became Primitive Quendian instead. He then conceived an entirely new tongue for the Valar, still called Valarin in Quenya.

== Internal story ==

The Valar as spiritual immortal beings have the ability to communicate through thought and have no need for a spoken language, but it appears that Valarin develops because of their assumption of physical, humanlike (or elf-like) forms. Valarin is unrelated to the other languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien. Only a few words (mainly proper names) of Valarin are recorded by the Elves.

=== Early conception ===

According to the earlier conception set forth in Tolkien&#x27;s sociolinguistic text, the &quot;Lhammas&quot;, the Valarin language family is subdivided into Oromëan, the Dwarves&#x27; Khuzdul (Aulëan), and Melkor&#x27;s Black Speech. In this work, all Elvish languages are descended from the tongue of Oromë, while the Dwarves speak the tongue devised by Aulë, and the Black Speech of the Orcs is invented for them by Melkor. Tolkien placed Valarin at the root of each version of his &quot;Tree of Tongues&quot;, indicating that in his conception at the time of the &quot;Lhammas&quot;, it was the original language from which developed all the languages of Middle-earth. Tolkien attributed his &quot;Descent of Tongues&quot; to the Elvish linguist Rúmil, in one of his frame stories. His biographer John Garth comments that while Rúmil&#x27;s lack of omniscience might seem convenient, saving Tolkien from having to work on Valarin in any detail, &quot;the unknown is essential to the legendarium, part of the illusion of depth so vital to its aura of authenticity.&quot;

The structure of the root of the first &quot;Tree of Tongues&quot; in the &quot;Lhammas&quot; is:

=== Later conception ===

Valarin is alien to the ears of the Elves sometimes to the point of genuine displeasure, and few of them ever learn the language, only adopting some Valarin words into their own language, Quenya. The Valar know Quenya and use it to converse with the Elves, or with each other if Elves are present. Valarin contains sounds that the Elves find difficult to produce, and the words are mostly long; for example, the Valarin word for Telperion, one of the Two Trees of Valinor, &quot;Ibrîniðilpathânezel&quot;, has eight syllables. The Vanyar adopt more words into their Vanyarin Tarquesta dialect from Valarin than the Noldor, as they lived closer to the Valar. Some of the Elven names of the Valar, such as Manwë, Ulmo, and Oromë, are adapted loanwords of their Valarin names.

== Grammar ==

Almost nothing is known of the grammar of Valarin. A plural is formed with &quot;-um-&quot; as an infix; so, &quot;Mâchanâz&quot; becomes in the plural &quot;Mâchanumâz&quot;, meaning &quot;Authorities, Aratar&quot;. 

Verb endings are not explained. Tolkien gives &quot;akašân&quot; as &quot;he says&quot; (present tense); &quot;dušamanûðân &quot; is &quot;marred&quot; (passive participle) and &quot; amanaišal&quot; as &quot;unmarred&quot; (hence Aman, the unmarred continent of the Valar), but he does not supply the roots of the associated verbs. The linguist Helge Fauskanger notes that the exact structure of the endings for these verb forms cannot be determined from this limited evidence. 

One other possibility relates to the word &quot;ayanûz&quot;, meaning Ainu, one of the Valar or Maiar; Fauskanger notes that Tolkien states that &quot;ayanu-&quot; means &quot;the name of the Spirits of Eru&#x27;s first creation&quot;, perhaps suggesting that from that root, &quot;ayanûz&quot; might be the nominative singular form.

<doc id="518391" wikidata="Q171469" url="?curid=518391" title="Chris Amon">
<text>Christopher Arthur Amon (; 20 July 1943 – 3 August 2016) was a New Zealand racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . Widely regarded as one of the greatest drivers to never win a Formula One Grand Prix, Amon won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in with Ford, as well as the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1967 with Ferrari.

Born and raised in Bulls, Amon learned to drive aged six and initially competed in hillclimbing before progressing to national motor racing competition in 1962. Amon joined Reg Parnell Racing the following year, making his Formula One debut at the . After a non-classified championship finish in his rookie season, Amon scored his maiden points finish with fifth-place at the 1964 Dutch Grand Prix. Following intermittent Grand Prix appearances in , Amon became a test driver for McLaren and moved into sportscar racing. After winning the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans alongside Bruce McLaren, Amon was signed by Ferrari for , achieving his maiden podium at the amongst winning the 24 Hours of Daytona. He finished a career-best fifth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. After struggling with reliability at Ferrari in and , Amon departed the team in search of Cosworth DFV-powered machinery. He scored several further podiums with March in before a two-year stint with Matra. Amon then made sporadic appearances for Tecno and Tyrrell in his campaign. Amon had founded Chris Amon Racing in 1966—when he entered the in a privateer Brabham BT11—and competed with them at four Grands Prix in , driving the AF101. Amon made further appearances for BRM, Ensign and Wolf–Williams before retiring at the end of the season.

Amon was renowned for his poor luck in Formula One, losing out on several World Championship race wins due to mechanical faults. Across 14 seasons, he achieved five pole positions, three fastest laps and 11 podiums, with two non-championship wins at the 1970 BRDC International Trophy and the 1971 Argentine Grand Prix. Outside of Formula One, Amon won the Tasman Series in 1969 with Scuderia Veloce. Amon was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1993 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, and inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame in 1995.

== Early life ==
Amon was born in Bulls, New Zealand, and attended Whanganui Collegiate School. He was the only child of wealthy sheep-owners Ngaio and Betty Amon. He learned to drive at the age of six, taught by a farm worker on the family farm. On leaving school, he persuaded his father to buy him an Austin A40 Special, which he entered in some minor local races and hillclimbs along with practice on the family farm. He progressed to a 1.5-litre Cooper and then an old 2.5-litre Maserati 250F, but only began to draw attention when he drove the Cooper-Climax T51 which Bruce McLaren had used to win his maiden Grand Prix.

In 1962 Amon entered the Cooper for the New Zealand winter series, but was hampered by mechanical problems. However, Scuderia Veloce entered him in a similar car, and, in the rain at Lakeside, he performed well. One of the spectators there was the English racing driver Reg Parnell who persuaded Amon to come to England and race for his team. In a test at Goodwood Amon continued to impress and was on the pace in the Goodwood International Trophy and Aintree 200 pre-season races.

==Racing career==
===1960s===

====1963====
For the 1963 Formula One season the Parnell team were using the year old Lola Mk4A, powered by 1962 specification Climax V8 engines. Amon was teamed with the very experienced Maurice Trintignant for the first race of the season at Monaco and his Grand Prix career started with what was to become typical bad luck: Trintignant&#x27;s Climax developed a misfire, so he took over Amon&#x27;s car.

At the 1963 Belgian Grand Prix, Amon was partnered by Lucien Bianchi and started ahead of him from 15th position. After nine laps, however, an oil fire ended his race. He continued to experience mechanical problems at the Dutch, Mexican and German Grands Prix; and after an accident in practice for the Italian Grand Prix left him hanging out of his car&#x27;s cockpit with three broken ribs, he missed both the Italian and United States rounds.

Amon usually qualified in the midfield and generally outpaced his teammates, who included his good friend Mike Hailwood. His best results of the year were seventh at the French and British Grands Prix. During this time, however, Amon&#x27;s social life was attracting as much attention as his driving. He was a member of the Ditton Road Flyers, the social set named after the road in London where Amon shared an apartment with American Peter Revson, Hailwood and Tony Maggs.

Parnell was nonetheless impressed with Amon&#x27;s results in what was regarded as less-than-competitive machinery and promoted him to team leader. Parnell died from peritonitis in January 1964 and his son Tim took over the team.

====1964====
In a series of four pre-season races in Britain and Italy, Amon recorded three fifth places at Snetterton, Silverstone and Syracuse. He failed to qualify for the first F1 race of the season, the Monaco GP, but at the next race, the Dutch GP, he scored his first World Championship points. The rest of his season, however, was blighted by mechanical problems.

====1965====
Parnell was offered BRM engines for 1965, but only if it ran Richard Attwood as its regular driver. Reluctantly, Parnell agreed and Attwood took Amon&#x27;s place. Spotting an opportunity, Bruce McLaren quickly signed Amon for his new McLaren team, but when no second McLaren F1 car materialised, Amon could only drive in sports car races.

At the French GP Amon rejoined Parnell to stand in for an injured Attwood. Amon also competed in a Formula Two race in Stuttgart and won. He returned to Germany for the German GP as second Parnell driver, but mechanical failure again forced an early retirement. His last drive before Attwood&#x27;s return, a non-championship race in Enna, Sicily, also ended in retirement.

====1966====
During 1966 Amon continued to race for McLaren in Can-Am. He was intended to drive the second McLaren M2B but difficulties with engine supply meant that the team never made the intended expansion to two cars. (James Garner&#x27;s character Pete Aron&#x27;s helmet and car livery in the film &quot;Grand Prix&quot; were modelled on Amon driving a McLaren, which caused the movie makers to have to encourage other cars to be painted in the &#x27;Yamura&#x27; colours and other drivers (Bruce McLaren included) to wear Amon-style helmets.)

However, an opportunity arose to drive for the Cooper F1 team after Richie Ginther left them for Honda. Amon drove for Cooper at the French GP and was scheduled to drive for them for the rest of the season, until the more successful John Surtees left Scuderia Ferrari to join Cooper and Amon found himself dropped.

Amon made one other F1 appearance during the year, driving a Brabham BT11 powered by an old 2-litre BRM engine at the Italian GP under the banner of &quot;Chris Amon Racing&quot;. He failed to qualify.

Amon did however, score his biggest success to date when he partnered Bruce McLaren in a 7-litre Ford GT40 Mark II and Ken Miles to Ford&#x27;s dead-heat &quot;photo-finish&quot; after Miles was instructed to slow down despite leading at the Le Mans 24-hour race, spearheading a formation finish. He subsequently received an invitation to meet Enzo Ferrari at the Ferrari home in Maranello, where he signed to race for Ferrari in 1967 alongside Lorenzo Bandini, Mike Parkes and Ludovico Scarfiotti.

====1967====
Amon&#x27;s first year with Ferrari did not begin auspiciously. En route to Brands Hatch for the pre-season Formula One Race of Champions, he crashed his road car and, following race practice, had to withdraw. Tragedy then struck the Ferrari team when Bandini died following a crash during the 1967 Monaco Grand Prix, Mike Parkes broke both his legs at the Belgian Grand Prix and, in the aftermath, Ludovico Scarfiotti went into temporary retirement. Amon, therefore, became Ferrari&#x27;s only driver for the rest of the season, until joined by Jonathan Williams for the final race in Mexico. Amon scored his first podium in his first official outing for the Scuderia in Monaco and at the end of 1967 had achieved four third places finishing fifth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, in what was going to be the most successful season of his career.

Amon&#x27;s Ferrari contract also included sports car racing and he began 1967 by winning the Daytona 24 Hours and 1000km Monza events with Bandini in the 4-litre Ferrari 330-P4. He finished the year partnering Jackie Stewart to a second place at the BOAC 500, thereby clinching the manufacturer&#x27;s world championship for Ferrari by one point over Porsche.

====1968====

1968 was the year aerodynamics first played a significant role in F1 car design and Amon worked with engineer Mauro Forghieri to place aerofoils on the Ferrari 312.

In January 1968 Amon had returned home to New Zealand and Australia to compete in the 1968 Tasman Series which was used by many of the top Formula One drivers as a warm up series to the World Championship. For the 1968 series Ferrari decided to use the 2.4 engines with a new Dino 166 F2 chassis rather than a downsized 3-litre V12. Using the 246T Amon won the first two rounds of the Tasman Series, including the 1968 New Zealand Grand Prix, before narrowly losing the series to the Lotus-Ford of Jim Clark. The Dino 246 Tasmania was better handling than Clark&#x27;s Lotus 49T which was still wingless and a difficult proposition. Impressed by Amon&#x27;s driving in the NZ rounds, Ferrari dispatched a new four-valve version of the 2.4 V6 for the Australian rounds and this gave another 15 hp, but with lesser reliability which, combined with the fact Clark was the best driver in the world at the time, cost Amon the series, although in the final round at Sandown Park he duelled wheel to wheel with Clark before being pipped at the line.

After the first race of the F1 season in South Africa, Amon achieved pole positions in three of the following four races (at the Spanish, Belgian and Dutch Grands Prix) but ever-present mechanical problems meant he secured only a single Championship point from them. Throughout the rest of the season he never qualified lower than fifth place and nearly scored victories at the British and Canadian rounds and he suffered a 100 mph crash in Italy which demolished his car. In Britain, he duelled to the line with Jo Siffert&#x27;s Lotus 49B and in Canada he dominated the race despite a malfunctioning clutch. Seventeen laps from the finish, however, his car&#x27;s transmission failed and a distraught Amon had to be consoled by Jacky Ickx. From at least ten promising starts that season he was only able to finish five races and score ten Championship points. His best finish was second place to Siffert&#x27;s Lotus-Cosworth at the British Grand Prix.

Outside F1, Amon was runner-up in the Formula Two race at Zolder, Belgium, testing the Dino 166 F2. He also came third in that year&#x27;s BRDC International Trophy.

====1969====

Amon began 1969 with success driving the Dino engined 246 Tasmania in the Tasman Series that included winning both the New Zealand and Australian Grands Prix. In straight fights, he beat new Gold Leaf Lotus team leader, Jochen Rindt, into second in the races at Pukekohe and Sandown. He would ultimately win the seven race Tasman Series, probably the best of the seven-year 2.5-litre international formula series in this country and the nearest to World Championship level racing in New Zealand, with ferocious competition between Rindt, Graham Hill, Amon and Williams driver Piers Courage. It was actually much more serious racing than the McLaren dominated Can-Am series in the US in which the big sports cars required few gear changes and were essentially cruised to victory with little real competition, where the Tasman cars were essentially marginally lower power F1 cars, as difficult to drive as GP cars on unforgiving very dangerous narrow tracks. Amon finished with four wins, two-thirds and one retirement, but in Formula One his poor luck continued. Despite six starts from top-six positions, he was only able to achieve a third-place at the Dutch GP. The ageing 312 was still quick at the start of the season and after the Lotus 49Bs of Rindt and Graham Hill crashed spectacularly after high wing failure in the opening laps at Barcelona, Amon dominated the Spanish GP until the almost inevitable engine breakage on lap 56, 40 seconds ahead of Stewart&#x27;s Matra. At Monaco Amon ran second to Stewart for the first 17 laps losing a second a lap to Stewart, but still gaining a second a lap on the third placed G. Hill who survived the race of attrition to win. Ferrari&#x27;s F1 V12 engine was too unreliable and although its replacement had proven very fast in testing, it had suffered many mechanical breakages. Amon had no reason to believe it would be any more dependable than the V12, so although the new engine was clearly more powerful, he decided to leave Ferrari for a Cosworth DFV powered team. He was more influenced by views of Jackie Stewart and Jochen Rindt, who believed it was essential to be Ford DFV-powered to be competitive.

In addition to Formula One, Amon also drove for Ferrari in the 1969 International Championship for Makes, partnering Pedro Rodriguez to a fourth place in the BOAC 500 at Brands Hatch and coming second at the 12 Hours of Sebring, but retiring from the 1000km Nürburgring and 1000km Monza races, all in the Ferrari 312P sportscar. He also drove in a few Can-Am races. His last race for Ferrari would be the 1970 1000 km Monza, where he finished as runner-up.

===1970s===

====1970====
For the 1970 Formula One season, Amon made what was to be the first of several moves to smaller, newer teams. March Engineering had been formed the previous year to build custom chassis for Formulas 2 and 3, but quickly moved into F1, designing and building the March 701. Amon and Siffert were signed as drivers, with IndyCar driver Mario Andretti making an occasional appearance in a third car. March also sold their 701 chassis to Tyrrell, where Jackie Stewart drove it to its first victory in that year&#x27;s Spanish GP. 

Amon won the pre-season Silverstone International Trophy, but once the F1 season began he found himself prevented from converting good qualifying positions into good results. He qualified second behind Stewart&#x27;s Tyrrell-March for the season-opening South African Grand Prix only for his own March to overheat within fourteen laps. Amon then qualified sixth for the Spanish Grand Prix only for his March&#x27;s Ford-Cosworth DFV engine to expire within ten laps. He qualified and ran second in the 1970 Monaco Grand Prix until his suspension failed twenty laps from the finish. This was the race where Amon refused to drive unless his entry number was changed from 18 – the number under which his then teammate Lorenzo Bandini had crashed and died in Monaco – to 28.

Amon&#x27;s close second place from a third-place start at the 1970 Belgian Grand Prix finally gave the March works team their first points finish. At that race, Amon set fastest lap at over 152 miles per hour, a lap record which still stands as of 2016, as it was the last race on the full-length Spa-Francorchamps circuit. However, after qualifying fourth for the next race, the Dutch Grand Prix, his car&#x27;s clutch broke after just one lap. Amon duplicated his Belgian result at the 1970 French Grand Prix. After a disappointing performance in the British GP at Brands Hatch where Amon finished fifth after being outqualified by tyro Ronnie Peterson in a private 701 on the same tyres, conflict with team boss Max Mosley over the non-delivery of three-quarters of Amon&#x27;s expected pay for the season saw him provided with inferior DFVs and two backmarker 7th places in Austria and Italy, Amon finished the season strongly with strong drives to third at Mosport, fifth at Watkins Glen and fourth in Mexico. At Watkins Glen in the USGP he was robbed of a probably certain victory, in the opinion of March designer Robin Herd, by a puncture.

By the end of the year, disagreements with March co-founders Mosley and Robin Herd meant that Amon had decided to move to another relatively new team, Matra.

====1971====
In 1971, Amon, now driving for the Matra factory team, once again scored a pre-season victory, this time at the Argentine Grand Prix. Once the Formula One season had begun, he managed to convert a third-place start at the Spanish GP into a third-place podium finish and scored a couple of fifth places in the South African and French GPs. Apart from these results, however, his run of poor F1 returns continued. He had a major accident at the Nürburgring and it sidelined him for the next race at the Österreichring. At the Italian GP he qualified in pole position and despite a poor start to the race looked as if he would capitalise on it – until the visor on his helmet became detached. Amon had to slow to avoid risking a major accident, thereby allowing other drivers to catch and overtake him. He finished the race in sixth place, scoring just one Championship point.

During the year Amon also competed in the non-championship Questor Grand Prix at the new Ontario Motor Speedway, where he qualified second and, despite suffering a puncture during the race, managed to finish fourth.

In the Tasman Series Amon started from fourth at the Levin Circuit and in the race, he battled with David Oxton and John Cannon but managed to finish third. Amon&#x27;s third race at Wigram Airfield starting fifth and spun at the start to drop him to the back of the field but managed to climb up to fifth.

====1972====
In the 1972 Formula One season, Amon, again driving for Matra achieved a handful of points-scoring finishes, but only one podium appearance, at the French GP. Here he achieved the fifth and final pole position of his career and was leading the race until a puncture forced him to pit. However, he climbed back through the field, breaking the circuit&#x27;s lap record to finish third.

With the money he had made from motorsport, Amon decided to set up a racing engine firm with former BRM engineer Aubrey Woods. Amon Racing Engines supplied Formula 2 engines to a few drivers, but the company quickly became too expensive to run and was sold to March for a loss.

Matra decided to end their participation in Formula One at the end of 1972, so Amon found himself looking to return to March as a driver. The place, however, was given to Jean-Pierre Jarier, purportedly for financial reasons. Amon therefore signed for another recently formed F1 team, Tecno.

====1973====
Tecno had entered F1 the previous year, having developed a potentially powerful Flat 12 for F1. But their first year in F1 proved to be dismal so they jumped at the chance to sign Amon for the new season. The testing of a new chassis designed by former Lotus and McLaren mechanic Allan McCall proved to be time-consuming. After its non-appearance for the Spanish GP, Amon and Tecno team manager David Yorke met with Enzo Ferrari to see if Amon could be released from his contract to develop the new Ferrari B3 for Ickx and Mezarrio, in a supposedly one off GP drive at Monaco. Yorke rejected the release, and Amon admits he would not have left Ferrari if offered the drive for a season.
Unfortunately, the team went from bad to worse and wasn&#x27;t able to field the Tecno PA123/6 until the fifth GP of the season, the Belgian GP. Amon managed to finish in sixth position. At Monaco the car qualified a useful 12th and chassis felt good but Chris was unhappy with the car. He decided to concentrate on a still in-development Tecno chassis built by unproven designer Gordon Fowell. This was against the view of the Techno team and Sponsors Martini Rossi who required the car and driver to appear at races While Amon commented at the time that it was &quot;the best chassis I&#x27;ve ever sat in&quot;, it too proved virtually undriveable. Amon refused to drive the McCall designed Techno in the Swedish or German Gps and withdrew from the Austrian GP after qualifying. By the time of the Austrian GP, four races from the end of the season, Amon&#x27;s patience had run out and he left the team. He would later claim that the months he spent with the team &quot;felt like ten [seasons]&quot;.

Tyrrell offered Amon a third car – the 005 – in which to drive the last two races of the season. After a mediocre first outing at the Canadian GP, he and Jackie Stewart withdrew from the final race of the year, the United States GP, following the death of their teammate François Cevert during qualifying.

====1974====

For the 1974 F1 season, Amon revived Chris Amon Racing. Gordon Fowell designed the car, the AF101, which featured a single central fuel tank, titanium torsion bars and a forward driving position. Structurally, however, it proved to be weak and was not ready for an F1 appearance until the fourth race of the season, the Spanish GP. Amon was only able to qualify 23rd, thanks to brake-disc vibration that only became worse with the tyres for the wet race that followed. Despite cautious driving, a brake shaft finally broke and Amon was forced to retire after 22 laps.

Following further work and testing, Amon returned for the Monaco GP and qualified twentieth, but, thanks to mechanical problems, he was unable to start the race. Further problems and illness meant Amon was not able to reappear with the F101 until the Italian GP, three races from the end of the season, but this time he was unable to qualify. That sealed the fate of both the car and Chris Amon Racing, leaving Amon to drive the season&#x27;s last two races with the faltering BRM team. He would later reveal that he had turned down a chance to join the Brabham team earlier in the season.

====1975====
Amon contested the 1975 F5000 Tasman series against only Australasian drivers. He qualified on the front row of three of the four New Zealand rounds and scored a victory at Teretonga in January 1975 in rainy conditions by 24.2 seconds. In the Australian rounds, the competition was always harder with more good cars and the locals on their own tracks. Amon had a frustrating series of races unable to pass, South Australian Johnnie Walker, in a superior Lola T332 chassis with Repco-engineered V8. At Surfers Paradise, running from the back of the grid he managed to eventually pass Walker by widening the braking zone in the only corner where overtaking was usually possible. Amon brushed the edge of the track on repeated laps, got extra grip and passed Walker to take the lead. He had been forced to miss most of the practice session, when Customs seized his car&#x27;s gearbox. In the race, the brilliant effort went for nothing as the Chev engine blew. At Oran Park and Adelaide he followed Walker the whole way to 4th and 3rd unable to pass. In the final deciding race for the Tasman Series with Brown, Walker and Lawrence still in contention, Walker lost his T332 on the first lap and it demolished on wooden barriers surrounding Sandown&#x27;s car and horse racing tracks. Amon was never in contention and finished 4th. Amon intended to compete in F5000 in both Europe and the US in 1975 but started in only one round of both series, managing a pole in one Shellsport round in the UK and a 4th place overall at the Long Beach GP in a two heat race. He used different Talon F5000 cars for both races. Apart from these successes, Amon&#x27;s racing career seemed once again to have stalled. Yet the speed he showed in qualifying for a couple of UK F5000 races encouraged Mo Nunn of the small Ensign team to give him a race driving the Ensign N175. Amon managed 7th in the non-championship Swiss GP at Dijon, which led to two more drives for the team, finishing 12th in both the Austrian and Italian GPs. At Monza after a long pit stop he finally ran at competitive pace, running 4 laps down but keeping pace with the leading Ferrari 312T of Niki Lauda for a number of laps. Progressive evaluation of the possibilities of what was slowing the N175 led Amon to change the airbox alignment on the day of the Italian GP and this resulted in a 2-second gain (much like the change in air cooler position that lost and gained two seconds on Hunt&#x27;s McLaren M23 resolved by the 1976 French GP). Ironically Amon never raced the N175 again and the high airboxes had been banned by the time N176 ran at Jarama the following year, but the flash of testing and driving genius was enough to give Amon another chance. Although the results were unremarkable, he and Nunn worked well together, so Amon joined Ensign for the 1976 F1 season.

====1976====

Ensign&#x27;s first race of the season was the South African GP where Amon qualified 18th and showed a revival of form, climbing to seventh place, in the old Ensign N174 and contesting sixth with Mario Andretti in the Parnelli Ford, in the last laps before a last minute refueling stop left him 14th. Thereafter results began to improve, with Amon qualifying 17th and finishing eighth in the USA West GP; qualifying tenth and finishing fifth in the Spanish GP; and then qualifying eighth for the Belgian GP. More points then seemed likely from the race until his car lost a wheel 19 laps from the finish and Amon was lucky to escape unhurt from the ensuing accident. He then achieved a third-place grid position start for the Swedish GP using a Nicholson rebuilt Cosworth for the first time and in the race looked as if he would join Tyrrell drivers Jody Scheckter and Patrick Depailler on the podium, until suspension failure threw him from the track after 38 laps.

Amon had again been lucky to escape serious injury and decided to miss the next race, the French GP. He returned for the British GP, qualifying in sixth and running fourth in the race when his Ford-Cosworth DFV engine developed a water leak. Rather than risk losing an engine, his team called him in to retire.

At the German GP problems dogged his attempts to qualify well, but it was Niki Lauda&#x27;s crash during the second lap of the race that had a far greater impact. Amon refused to restart the race and Nunn fired him from the team. Amon declared his retirement from the sport and returned to New Zealand.

&quot;I&#x27;d seen too many people fried in racing cars at that stage. When you&#x27;ve driven past Bandini, Schlesser, Courage and Williamson, another shunt like that was simply too much. It was a personal decision...&quot;
(Amon, on his retirement in 1976)However, Walter Wolf contacted Amon and persuaded him to drive for his Wolf–Williams team in the North American races near the end of the season. After recording some promising times in preparation for the Canadian GP, however, Amon was involved in a heavy collision with another car during qualifying and once again was lucky to walk away unharmed. He then did not take part in either the Canadian or United States Grands Prix.

====1977====
Amon turned down an offer of a full-time F1 drive for 1977, but did attempt a return to Can-Am racing in 1977 with a Wolf-Dallara WD1. However, after only one race he quit, saying &quot;I&#x27;m just not enjoying this anymore&quot;. His place was taken by the young and then unknown Canadian Gilles Villeneuve, whom Amon would, later that year, recommend to Enzo Ferrari.

In the meantime, Amon returned once again to New Zealand, this time to retire from F1 motor racing for good.

===2000s===

;2003

Amon came out of retirement for a one-off appearance in the 2003 Dunlop Targa New Zealand with motorsport commentator Murray Walker as his navigator. The pair completed the week-long Auckland to Wellington Tarmac Rally in a Toyota Camry Sportivo, the same car previously used by Walker and Colin Bond in Australia&#x27;s Targa Tasmania.

== Retirement ==
After his retirement from F1, Amon dedicated himself to running the family farm in New Zealand&#x27;s Manawatū District for many years. After retiring from farming, he lived in Taupō in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. In the early 1980s he became more well known in New Zealand from test-driving vehicles on the TV motoring series &quot;Motor Show&quot; and later consulted for Toyota New Zealand, tuning the 1984 Toyota Corolla and subsequent cars for sale there. He also appeared in TV commercials for the company, where much was made of the acclaim he won from Enzo Ferrari. Amon participated in the 2004 EnergyWise Rally where he won ahead of Brian Cowan. Amon drove a Toyota Prius for the event.

In the 1993 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Amon was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to motor sport.

Amon was involved in the design of the upgraded Taupo Motorsport Park circuit, used for the New Zealand round of the 2006–07 A1 Grand Prix season in January 2007. At the New Zealand Festival of Motor Racing in 2011, Amon&#x27;s life and career were honoured with a selection of his cars being driven and also used the event to raise funds for the Bruce McLaren trust. Amon was also honoured at the festival in January 2013.

==Death==
Amon died in Rotorua Hospital on 3 August 2016, aged 73, of cancer. He was survived by his wife Tish Wotherspoon, who married in 1977, their three children and their grandchildren. One of his sons, James, is a qualified High Performance personal trainer. He trained Central Districts Stags cricket team, and was revealed to be Brendon Hartley&#x27;s personal trainer.

== Legacy ==

Amon is widely regarded as one of the best F1 drivers never to win a championship Grand Prix. His reputation for bad luck was such that fellow driver Mario Andretti once joked that &quot;if he became an undertaker, people would stop dying&quot;. Former Ferrari Technical Director Mauro Forghieri stated that Amon was &quot;by far the best test driver I have ever worked with. He had all the qualities to be a World Champion but bad luck just wouldn&#x27;t let him be&quot;.

Despite never winning a championship Formula One Grand Prix, Amon won two non-championship GPs, the Silverstone International Trophy, the 1000 km Monza, the Daytona 24 Hours, six Tasman Series races and one series championship, and, perhaps most significant of all, the famous 24 Heures du Mans (alongside Bruce McLaren). These races included many of Amon&#x27;s otherwise more successful fellow Formula One drivers. Amon also remains the only driver from New Zealand and Oceania to have raced for Scuderia Ferrari in Formula One.

In Formula One, Chris Amon took part in 96 Grands Prix, achieving 5 poles, leading 183 laps in 7 races, reaching the podium 11 times and scoring a total of 83 Championship points. Amon holds the record for the most different makes of car raced by a Formula 1 World Championship driver, with thirteen. A biography &quot;Forza Amon&quot; by journalist Eoin Young charts Amon&#x27;s racing career and gives some insights into his personal life. The book makes clear one point on which Amon himself disagrees with most commentators, the issue of his bad luck. Amon has pointed out on several occasions that he competed for a decade and a half in Formula One and survived some serious accidents, notably in 1976, whilst others, including friends like Bruce McLaren, suffered serious injury and death. In 2008, motorsport journalist Alan Henry rated Chris Amon as his 13th greatest driver.

Reflecting on the 1968 racing death of Jim Clark, Amon said: &quot;If this can happen to Jimmy, what chance do the rest of us have? I think we all felt that. It seemed like we&#x27;d lost our leader.&quot; In 1995, Amon was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame.

Amon&#x27;s name has been given to the Toyota Racing Series driver&#x27;s championship trophy, and the International Scholarship to support drivers who win his trophy to further their careers in single-seater racing. The Toyota Racing Series serves as motorsport&#x27;s version of &quot;winter ball&quot; in New Zealand during January and February. Following his death, his name was also lent to the Manfeild Autocourse in Feilding, Manawatū.

<doc id="518397" wikidata="Q532078" url="?curid=518397" title="Angle of repose">
<text>The angle of repose, or critical angle of repose, of a granular material is the steepest angle of descent or dip relative to the horizontal plane on which the material can be piled without slumping. At this angle, the material on the slope face is on the verge of sliding. The angle of repose can range from 0° to 90°. The morphology of the material affects the angle of repose; smooth, rounded sand grains cannot be piled as steeply as can rough, interlocking sands. The angle of repose can also be affected by additions of solvents. If a small amount of water is able to bridge the gaps between particles, electrostatic attraction of the water to mineral surfaces increases the angle of repose, and related quantities such as the soil strength.

When bulk granular materials are poured onto a horizontal surface, a conical pile forms. The internal angle between the surface of the pile and the horizontal surface is known as the angle of repose and is related to the density, surface area and shapes of the particles, and the coefficient of friction of the material. Material with a low angle of repose forms flatter piles than material with a high angle of repose.

The term has a related usage in mechanics, where it refers to the maximum angle at which an object can rest on an inclined plane without sliding down. This angle is equal to the arctangent of the coefficient of static friction &quot;μ&quot;s between the surfaces.

== Applications of theory ==
The angle of repose is sometimes used in the design of equipment for the processing of particulate solids. For example, it may be used to design an appropriate hopper or silo to store the material, or to size a conveyor belt for transporting the material. It can also be used in determining whether or not a slope (of a stockpile, or uncompacted gravel bank, for example) would likely collapse; the talus slope is derived from angle of repose and represents the steepest slope a pile of granular material can take. This angle of repose is also crucial in correctly calculating stability in vessels.

It is also commonly used by mountaineers as a factor in analysing avalanche danger in mountainous areas.

==Formulation==

If the coefficient of static friction &quot;μ&quot;s is known of a material, then a good approximation of the angle of repose can be made with the following function. This function is somewhat accurate for piles where individual objects in the pile are minuscule and piled in random order.

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the angle of repose.

A simple free body diagram can be used to understand the relationship between the angle of repose and the stability of the material on the slope. For the heaped material to resist collapse, the frictional forces must be equivalent to the horizontal component of the gravitational force formula_3, where formula_4 is the mass of the material, formula_5 is the gravitational acceleration and formula_2 is the slope angle:

:formula_7

The frictional force formula_8 is equivalent to the multiplication product of the coefficient of static friction formula_9 and the Normal Force formula_10 or formula_11:

:formula_12

:formula_13

:formula_14

:formula_15

Where formula_16 is the angle of repose, or the angle at which the slope fails under regular conditions, and formula_17 is the coefficient of static friction of the material on the slope.

== Measurement ==
There are numerous methods for measuring angle of repose and each produces slightly different results. Results are also sensitive to the exact methodology of the experimenter. As a result, data from different labs are not always comparable. One method is the triaxial shear test, another is the direct shear test.

The measured angle of repose may vary with the method used, as described below.

=== Tilting box method ===
This method is appropriate for fine-grained, non-cohesive materials with individual particle size less than 10 mm. The material is placed within a box with a transparent side to observe the granular test material. It should initially be level and parallel to the base of the box. The box is slowly tilted until the material begins to slide in bulk, and the angle of the tilt is measured.

=== Fixed funnel method ===
The material is poured through a funnel to form a cone. The tip of the funnel should be held close to the growing cone and slowly raised as the pile grows, to minimize the impact of falling particles. Stop pouring the material when the pile reaches a predetermined height or the base a predetermined width. Rather than attempt to measure the angle of the resulting cone directly, divide the height by half the width of the base of the cone. The inverse tangent of this ratio is the angle of repose.

=== Revolving cylinder method ===
The material is placed within a cylinder with at least one transparent end. The cylinder is rotated at a fixed speed, and the observer watches the material move within it. The effect is similar to watching clothes tumble over one another in a slowly rotating clothes dryer. The granular material assumes a certain angle as it flows within the rotating cylinder. This method is recommended for obtaining the dynamic angle of repose, which may vary from the static angle of repose measured by other methods.

== Of various materials ==

Here is a list of various materials and their angle of repose. All measurements are approximated.

== With different supports ==
Different supports modify the shape of the pile, in the illustrations below sand piles, although angles of repose remain the same.

== Exploitation by antlion and wormlion (Vermileonidae) larvae ==
The larvae of the antlions and the unrelated wormlions Vermileonidae trap small insects such as ants by digging conical pits in loose sand, such that the slope of the walls is effectively at the critical angle of repose for the sand. They achieve this by flinging the loose sand out of the pit and permitting the sand to settle at its critical angle of repose as it falls back. Thus, when a small insect, commonly an ant, blunders into the pit, its weight causes the sand to collapse below it, drawing the victim toward the center where the predator that dug the pit lies in wait under a thin layer of loose sand. The larva assists this process by vigorously flicking sand out from the center of the pit when it detects a disturbance. This undermines the pit walls and causes them to collapse toward the center. The sand that the larva flings also pelts the prey with loose rolling material that prevents it from getting any foothold on the easier slopes that the initial collapse of the slope has presented. The combined effect is to bring the prey down to within grasp of the larva, which then can inject venom and digestive fluids.

== In geotechnics ==
== See also ==
The angle of repose plays a part in several topics of technology and science, including:

* Aeolian processes
* Barchan
* Bulk cargo
* Concrete slump test
* Grade (slope)
* Mass wasting
* Oceanic trench
* Retaining wall
* Rotary kiln

<text>The Codebreakers – The Story of Secret Writing () is a book by David Kahn, published in 1967, comprehensively chronicling the history of cryptography from ancient Egypt to the time of its writing. The United States government attempted to have the book altered before publication, and it succeeded in part.

==Overview==
Bradford Hardie III, an American cryptographer during World War II, contributed insider information, German translations from original documents, and intimate real-time operational explanations to &quot;The Codebreakers&quot;.

&quot;The Codebreakers&quot; is widely regarded as the best account of the history of cryptography up to its publication. William Crowell, the former deputy director of the National Security Agency, was quoted in &quot;Newsday&quot; magazine: &quot;Before he (Kahn) came along, the best you could do was buy an explanatory book that usually was too technical and terribly dull.&quot;

&quot;The Puzzle Palace&quot; (1982), written by James Bamford, gives a history of the writing and publication of &quot;The Codebreakers&quot;. Kahn, then a journalist, was contracted to write a book on cryptology in 1961. He began writing it part-time, and then he quit his job to work on it full-time. The book was to include information on the NSA and, according to Bamford, the agency attempted to stop its publication. The NSA considered various options, including writing a negative review of Kahn&#x27;s work to be published in the press to discredit him.

A committee of the United States Intelligence Board concluded that the book was &quot;a possibly valuable support to foreign COMSEC authorities&quot; and recommended &quot;further low-key actions as possible, but short of legal action, to discourage Mr. Kahn or his prospective publishers&quot;. Kahn&#x27;s publisher, Macmillan and Sons, handed over the manuscript to the government for review without Kahn&#x27;s permission on 4 March 1966. Kahn and Macmillan eventually agreed to remove some material from the manuscript, particularly concerning the relationship between the NSA and its counterpart in the United Kingdom, GCHQ.

The book finishes with a chapter on SETI. Because of the year of its publication, the book did not cover most of the history concerning the breaking of the German Enigma machine, which became public knowledge during the 1970s. Hence, not much was said of Alan Turing. It also did not cover the advent of strong cryptography in the public domain, beginning with the invention of public key cryptography and the specification of the Data Encryption Standard in the mid-1970s. The book was republished in 1996, and this new edition included an additional chapter briefly covering the events since the original publication.

<text>The prime minister of the Faroe Islands is the head of government of the Faroe Islands.

The Faroese term (plural: ) literally means &quot;lawman&quot; and originally referred to the legal function of lawspeaker. This old title was brought back into use to refer to the head of government after the islands obtained Home Rule in 1948. In recent decades the Faroese government has started using &quot;Prime Minister&quot; as the official English translation of , reflecting the increased autonomy of the islands. This translation does not apply to the pre-1816 office, only the modern leaders of the Faroese government.

<doc id="518402" wikidata="Q1135521" url="?curid=518402" title="The Path to the Nest of Spiders">
<text>The Path to the Nest of Spiders () is a 1947 novel by the Italian writer Italo Calvino. The narrative is a coming-of-age story, set against the backdrop of World War II. It was Calvino&#x27;s first novel.

==Plot==
Pin, an orphaned cobbler&#x27;s apprentice in a town on the Ligurian coast, lives with his sister, a prostitute and spends as much time as he can at a seedy bar where he amuses the adult patrons. After stealing a pistol from a Nazi sailor, Pin searches for an identity with an Italian partisan group. All the while, the people he meets mock him without his knowing. The title refers to Pin&#x27;s secret hiding place, directions to which he touts as a prize to any adults who win his trust.

==Reception==
Some critics view the work as unexceptional, on the grounds that it fails to address the issues other than from a very naive perspective; others credit it with being skillfully written 
and make a virtue of its portrayal of the complex emotions and politics of adults, as seen through the eyes of a child. However one passage about prisoners-of-war being made to dig their own grave before being shot is universally regarded as impressive.

<doc id="518430" wikidata="Q2166292" url="?curid=518430" title="Toad the Wet Sprocket">
<text>Toad the Wet Sprocket is an American alternative rock band formed in Santa Barbara, California, in 1986. The band at the time consisted of vocalist/guitarist Glen Phillips, guitarist Todd Nichols, bassist Dean Dinning, and drummer Randy Guss, who stopped touring in 2017 and left the band in 2020. Guss was replaced by drummer Josh Daubin, who supported them as their drummer on tours from 2017 through 2022 and also played drums on their 2021 album &quot;Starting Now&quot;. Most recently, Carl Thomson took Daubin&#x27;s place and has been drumming for Toad the Wet Sprocket on tour since 2023. They had chart success in the 1990s with singles that included &quot;Walk on the Ocean&quot;, &quot;All I Want&quot;, &quot;Something&#x27;s Always Wrong&quot;, &quot;Fall Down&quot;, and &quot;Good Intentions&quot;. 

The band broke up in 1998 to pursue other projects; however, they began touring the United States again in 2006 for short-run tours each summer in small venues. In December 2010, the band announced their official reunion as a full-time working band; they also started writing songs for their first studio album of new material since their 1997 Columbia Records release, &quot;Coil&quot;. Their most recent full-length album, &quot;Starting Now&quot;, was released on August 27, 2021.

== History ==
=== Name origin ===
Toad the Wet Sprocket takes its name from a Monty Python comedy sketch called &quot;Rock Notes&quot;, in which a journalist delivers a nonsensical music news report: 

There was also an extended skit about the fictional Toad the Wet Sprocket on one of Idle&#x27;s later shows, &quot;Rutland Weekend Television&quot; (Season 1, Episode 4, &quot;Rutland Weekend Whistle Test&quot;). &quot;RWT&quot; musician and regular cast member Neil Innes, ex-Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and &quot;The Seventh Python&quot;, played keyboards with the somnolent band.

As their first gig approached, the band still had not chosen a name. The members facetiously adopted &quot;Toad the Wet Sprocket&quot; because they thought it would be &quot;hilarious&quot;. Vocalist Glen Phillips later called it &quot;a joke that went on too long&quot; and, according to their website, &quot;it was probably meant to be temporary at the time.&quot; The name had been used once before, by a short-lived British blues band of the late 1970s that had appeared on the 1980 &quot;Metal for Muthas&quot; compilation, although the earlier band had long since split up when Philips and company formed their band.

Eric Idle, the sketch&#x27;s original performer, reflected on the band&#x27;s name in a 1999 performance: 

=== Early career (1986–1990) ===
Toad the Wet Sprocket was formed in 1986, with the members having known one another from San Marcos High School just outside Santa Barbara, California. Singer/songwriter and guitarist Glen Phillips was only 15, while guitarist Todd Nichols, bassist Dean Dinning, and drummer Randy Guss were 19. The band&#x27;s first public appearance was at an open-mic talent contest in September 1986. The band did not win.

Toad the Wet Sprocket&#x27;s first album was released in 1989. &quot;Bread &amp; Circus&quot; was self-financed through their label, Abe&#x27;s Records. The album spawned the singles &quot;Way Away&quot; and &quot;One Little Girl&quot;, which made the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart but received little attention.

The follow-up to &quot;Bread &amp; Circus&quot;, &quot;Pale&quot;, was released in 1990, and saw Toad the Wet Sprocket&#x27;s sound mature. During the recording of the album, the band signed to Columbia Records while declining the opportunity to re-record &quot;Pale&quot; but negotiating to have Columbia Records reissue &quot;Bread &amp; Circus&quot;. Featuring the singles &quot;Jam&quot; and the modern-rock chart hit &quot;Come Back Down&quot;, the album was still not a success, but the singles received heavy airplay on college radio stations. The band&#x27;s first music video (for &quot;One Little Girl&quot;) was directed by Mark Miremont and aired on MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;.

=== Commercial breakthrough (1991–1998) ===
Toad the Wet Sprocket finally achieved fame with their third album, 1991&#x27;s &quot;fear&quot;. The album&#x27;s singles &quot;All I Want&quot; and &quot;Walk on the Ocean&quot; reached the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album became the band&#x27;s first RIAA-certified platinum album.

In 1993, the Mike Myers feature film &quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot; included the song &quot;Brother&quot; on its soundtrack. &quot;Brother&quot; later appeared on the &quot;In Light Syrup&quot; compilation album, as well as the &quot;CD Extra&quot; compilation album included with IBM Aptiva PCs in 1996. The song was later included on the 2004 release of the live album &quot;Welcome Home: Live at the Arlington Theatre, Santa Barbara 1992&quot;.

In 1994, after years of heavy touring, Toad the Wet Sprocket released &quot;Dulcinea&quot;, their follow-up to &quot;fear&quot;. This album spawned the hit singles &quot;Fall Down&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the U.S. Modern Rock charts, as well as No. 5 on the Mainstream Rock chart, and &quot;Something&#x27;s Always Wrong&quot;, which also charted. Like &quot;fear&quot;, this album was certified platinum by the RIAA.

A 1995 compilation album of b-sides and rarities, &quot;In Light Syrup,&quot; included the singles &quot;Good Intentions&quot;, which was featured on the soundtrack for the television show &quot;Friends&quot;, as well as the aforementioned &quot;Brother&quot;. The compilation was certified as a gold album in 2001.

The release of 1997&#x27;s &quot;Coil&quot; acted as the proper follow-up to 1994&#x27;s &quot;Dulcinea&quot;. Featuring a more electric, rock sound, it featured the modern-rock and mainstream rock hit &quot;Come Down&quot;, as well as the singles &quot;Crazy Life&quot; (a previous recording of the song was featured on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Empire Records&quot;) and &quot;Whatever I Fear&quot;, which did not chart. The album, despite the success of &quot;Come Down&quot; as a single, failed to reach any sales benchmarks. This failure is often attributed to the label doing a poor job of promoting the album.

Toad the Wet Sprocket formally broke up in July 1998, citing creative differences.

=== Post-breakup and reunions (1998–2008) ===
Toad the Wet Sprocket, though officially broken up since 1998, worked together off and on over the years. They performed on several occasions in 1999, although only short sets. Also in 1999, Phillips, Dinning, and Guss recorded two studio tracks for a compilation release, &quot;P.S. (A Toad Retrospective)&quot;, including one of the first songs the band wrote together, &quot;P.S.&quot; Nichols declined to participate in these sessions and was replaced by Lapdog guitarist Rob Taylor.

Toad the Wet Sprocket temporarily reunited in late 2002, playing a benefit for the Rape Crisis Center in Santa Barbara and opening a few shows for Counting Crows. The group then played a few months of full-length shows in early 2003. Although these gigs were seemingly successful, at the end of the tour, the band decided to continue on their separate paths and careers. In 2004, the band released an album of a live show that had been taped in 1992. This album, &quot;Welcome Home: Live at The Arlington Theatre, Santa Barbara 1992,&quot; showcased the height of their popularity during the tour for &quot;fear&quot;.

Between 2004 and 2010, Toad the Wet Sprocket performed several short sets together. In the summer of 2006, the band reunited for a 34-date nationwide tour of the United States. During the summer of 2007, they played several shows with lead singer Glen Phillips serving as their opening act. On January 16, 2008, the band reunited once again to play two shows – one in St. Petersburg, Florida, then the next night at the House of Blues Orlando, prior to joining The Rock Boat VIII. On January 25, 2008, the band played a set at the Ann Arbor Folk Festival in Ann Arbor, Michigan. On June 11–12, 2008, they played in Philadelphia and New Jersey at the Trocadero Theatre and Starland Ballroom, respectively. On June 14, 2008, they played at the 27th annual Alexandria Red Cross Waterfront Festival. On June 15, 2008, the band performed at The Norva in Norfolk, Virginia. One of the show&#x27;s highlights was the band performing Glen Phillip&#x27;s solo hit &quot;Everything But You&quot;.

On December 19, 2008, Toad the Wet Sprocket performed on &quot;The Adam Carolla Show&quot; at the Canyon Club in Agoura Hills, California. In May 2009, they played a four show mini-tour, including two nights at the intimate 400 seat venue The Ark in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and also in an outdoor venue at Neptunes Park in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Continuing throughout the 2009 summer, the group played a second 12-stop mini tour, which started with a show at the House of Blues in Houston. During the show, the band noted that it had been some time since they had played a venue in Texas. However, noting the positive crowd response and energetic atmosphere, Philips stated that the group &quot;would try to make it an annual stop&quot; in the future.

=== Full-time reunion, return to recording, &quot;New Constellation&quot;, and &quot;Starting Now&quot; (2009–present) ===
In 2009, bassist Dean Dinning said Toad the Wet Sprocket was now something each member considered an active project; though they had not released a new studio album since 1997, and only did small summer tours, they no longer considered themselves &quot;broken up&quot;. In May 2010, the band gathered at a California studio to begin re-recording some of their older hits for licensing reasons. Columbia Records owns the masters to the band&#x27;s albums. Therefore, the band makes little money from them, so to be able to make a living off their own talent again, they made these re-recordings with the goal of having them used in film and TV.

On December 7, 2010, Toad the Wet Sprocket released their first new studio track in 11 years. The holiday track &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Feel Like Christmas&quot;, a cover of a Sam Phillips original, was posted on their official site, available via Bandcamp, for free download just in time for the holidays, along with a new message on their site: &quot;We&#x27;re that band that did &#x27;Walk on the Ocean&#x27;, &#x27;All I Want&#x27;, &#x27;Something&#x27;s Always Wrong&#x27;, and &quot;Fall Down&#x27;. The one with the weird name. We&#x27;re back from a long slumber and look forward to saying hello some time. Keep in touch…&quot; The band had recently signed a deal with Primary Wave to handle their back catalog and any future releases, and on December 11, 2010, the band mentioned, both on stage and in an offstage YouTube interview, that they are currently writing songs for their first new studio album since 1997&#x27;s &quot;Coil&quot;. In addition, they began playing two new songs, &quot;Friendly Fire&quot; and &quot;The Moment&quot;, which were being worked on for the new album.

On April 12, 2011, Toad the Wet Sprocket released a new greatest hits album titled &quot;All You Want&quot; in digital and disc form via their official website. The 11-track CD includes brand new studio versions of their hits. The band does not have access to some of the versions they did for Columbia Records in the &#x27;90s. However, they did regain full control of the songs from their first two albums, and they planned to re-release them in remastered form on their own label, Abe&#x27;s Records, following the release of their upcoming studio album.

On March 22, 2013, it was announced via Toad the Wet Sprocket&#x27;s Facebook page that recording of the new album had been completed. The album was produced and mixed by Mikal Blue at Revolver Studios in Thousand Oaks, California. On June 5, 2013, the band announced the first new single in 16 years on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s website titled &quot;New Constellation&quot;. An album of the same name was released on the band&#x27;s own Abe&#x27;s Records on October 15, 2013. The band marketed the new album via the crowdsourcing website Kickstarter. The band initially set a fundraising goal of $50,000, expecting it to take about two months to raise that amount. Instead, fans contributed more than $50,000 in less than 20 hours. When the Kickstarter campaign finally came to a close, they had raised a total of $264,762. The band kicked off their new album with a release party for Kickstarter supporters at The Palm restaurant in Los Angeles, California, on August 23, 2013, followed immediately by a live performance at the nearby Troubadour music venue.

In 2014, Toad the Wet Sprocket resumed touring and opened a number of shows for Counting Crows. They showcased some of the new material from &quot;New Constellation&quot;, the Kickstarter-funded album, including &quot;California Wasted&quot; and the album&#x27;s title track while playing a number of their earlier hits. During summer 2015, the band went on tour with fellow &#x27;90s acts Smash Mouth and Tonic. The band released an EP called &quot;Architect of the Ruin&quot; on June 16, 2015.

In 2018, Toad the Wet Sprocket announced that they had reissued their albums &quot;fear&quot; and &quot;Dulcinea&quot; on a deluxe remastered vinyl LP available through their online store. The same year, they also released a limited deluxe 5-LP box set of colored vinyl for their albums &quot;fear&quot;, &quot;Dulcinea&quot; and &quot;Acoustic Dance Party&quot;.

In a January 2020 interview with ChicagoNow, Glen Phillips stated that &quot;Toad has started recording again.&quot; In addition, he confirmed the band&#x27;s first official lineup change, and that drummer Guss had left the band on good terms. Previous occasional touring member Josh Daubin replaced Guss.

On September 25, 2020, they released a new song titled &quot;Starting Now&quot;, followed by another new song &quot;Old Habits Die Hard&quot; on October 23, from their album, &quot;Starting Now&quot;, released on August 27, 2021.

==Musical style==
Toad the Wet Sprocket have been most consistently labelled as alternative rock, but their music has also been described as folk rock, pop rock, jangle pop, and folk-pop. 

AllMusic writer Kelly McCarteny described Toad&#x27;s early music as having a &quot;jangle pop, garage band sound&quot;, and noted that their album &quot;Fear&quot; was a shift to &quot;smart and catchy pop/rock songs&quot;.

== Associated acts ==

=== Glen Phillips&#x27; solo career ===

Immediately after the band&#x27;s breakup in 1998, Phillips began his solo career, releasing five solo studio albums: &quot;Abulum&quot; (2000), &quot;Winter Pays For Summer&quot; (2005), and &quot;Mr. Lemons&quot; (2006), &quot;Coyote Sessions&quot; (2012), and &quot;Swallowed by the New&quot; (2016), along with two live albums, &quot;Live At Largo&quot; (2003), and &quot;Live at the Belly Up&quot; (2016).

=== Lapdog ===

In the late 1990s, Nichols and Dinning formed a new band called Lapdog. They recorded and released the studio album &quot;Near Tonight&quot; (2001), and toured minimally. After this, Dinning quit the band to split his time between recording and producing local music and pursuing his acting career. Guss joined Lapdog as their drummer. Again, Lapdog recorded and released an album, called &quot;Mayfly&quot; (2002). Nichols has since ended Lapdog and is focusing on writing songs along with Dinning in Nashville for country acts, and producing bands at his studio, Abe&#x27;s, in Los Angeles. A Lapdog song, &quot;See You Again&quot;, appears in revamped/revised form on Toad the Wet Sprocket&#x27;s &quot;New Constellation&quot; album under the title &quot;I&#x27;ll Bet On You&quot;.

<text>Theodore DeReese Pendergrass (March 26, 1950 – January 13, 2010) was an American soul and R&amp;B singer-songwriter. He was born in Kingstree, South Carolina. Pendergrass lived most of his life in the Philadelphia area, and initially rose to musical fame as the lead singer of Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes. After leaving the group in 1976, Pendergrass launched a successful solo career under the Philadelphia International label, releasing five consecutive platinum albums (a record at the time for an African-American R&amp;B artist). Pendergrass&#x27;s career was suspended after a March 1982 car crash left him paralyzed from the chest down. Pendergrass continued his successful solo career until announcing his retirement in 2007. He died from respiratory failure in January 2010.

==Early life==
Teddy Pendergrass was born Theodore DeReese Pendergrass on March 26, 1950, in Kingstree, South Carolina. He was the only child of Jesse and Ida Geraldine (née Epps) Pendergrass. Ida suffered six miscarriages before successfully giving birth to Teddy. When Pendergrass was very young, his father left the family. As he grew older, his mother promised him that she would find his father so that they could meet. She fulfilled that promise, and Teddy met his father when he was 11 years old. Not long after, Jesse was stabbed to death on June 13, 1962, during an altercation with another man. He was 47 years of age. Pendergrass grew up in the impoverished section of North Philadelphia and often sang at church. He dreamed of being a pastor and got his wish when, at the age of 10, he was ordained a minister (according to author Robert Ewell Greene). Pendergrass also took up drums during this time and was a junior deacon of his church.

He attended Thomas Edison High School for Boys in North Philadelphia. He sang with the Edison Mastersingers. He dropped out in the 11th grade to enter the music business, recording his first song &quot;Angel with Muddy Feet&quot;. The recording, however, was not a commercial success. Pendergrass played drums for several local Philadelphia bands, eventually becoming the drummer of The Cadillacs (not the famed Harlem-based group of the same name). In 1970, he was spotted by the Blue Notes&#x27; founder, Harold Melvin (1939–1997), who convinced Pendergrass to play drums in the group. However, during a performance, Pendergrass began singing along, and Melvin, impressed by his vocals, made him the lead singer. Before Pendergrass joined the group, the Blue Notes had struggled to find success. This all changed when they landed a recording deal with Philadelphia International Records in 1971, thus beginning Pendergrass&#x27;s successful collaboration with label founders Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff.

==Early career==
===Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes: 1970–1975===
In 1972, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes released their first single, the slow, solemn ballad, &quot;I Miss You&quot;. The song was originally written for The Dells, but the group passed on it. Noting how Pendergrass sounded like Dells lead singer Marvin Junior, Kenny Gamble decided to build the song with Pendergrass, who was only 21 at the time of the recording. Pendergrass sings much of the song in a raspy baritone voice that would become his trademark. The song also featured Blue Notes member Lloyd Parks singing falsetto in the background and spotlighted Harold Melvin adding in a rap near the end of the song as Pendergrass kept singing, feigning tears. The song, one of Gamble and Huff&#x27;s most creative productions, became a major rhythm and blues hit and put the Blue Notes on the map. The group&#x27;s follow-up single, &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Know Me by Now&quot;, brought the group to the mainstream with the song reaching the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while also reaching number one on the soul no. 1 singles chart. Like &quot;I Miss You&quot; before it, the song was originally intended for a different artist, fellow Philadelphian native Patti LaBelle and her group Labelle but the group could not record it due to scheduling conflicts. Pendergrass and LaBelle developed a close friendship that would last until Pendergrass&#x27;s death.

The group rode to fame with several more releases over the years including &quot;The Love I Lost&quot;, a song that predated the upcoming disco music scene, the ballad &quot;Hope That We Can Be Together Soon&quot;, and socially conscious singles &quot;Wake Up Everybody&quot; and &quot;Bad Luck&quot;. One of the group&#x27;s notable singles was their original version of the Philly soul classic &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot;, which turned into a disco smash when Motown artist Thelma Houston released her version in 1976. By 1975, Pendergrass and Harold Melvin were at odds, mainly over financial issues and personality conflicts. Despite the fact that Pendergrass sang most of the group&#x27;s songs, Melvin was controlling the group&#x27;s finances. At one point, Pendergrass wanted the group to be renamed &quot;Teddy Pendergrass and the Blue Notes&quot; because fans kept mistaking him for Melvin. Pendergrass left the group in 1975, and the Blue Notes struggled with his replacements. They eventually left Philadelphia International and toiled in relative obscurity, until Melvin&#x27;s death in 1997. As of 2014, a version of the group still tours the old school circuit, performing as Harold Melvin&#x27;s Blue Notes.

==Solo career==
===Early solo success===

In 1977, Pendergrass released his self-titled album, which went platinum on the strength of the disco hit &quot;I Don&#x27;t Love You Anymore&quot;. Its follow-up single, &quot;The Whole Town&#x27;s Laughing at Me&quot;, became a top 20 R&amp;B hit. Although not released as singles, the uptempo album tracks &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hide from Yourself&quot; and &quot;The More I Get, The More I Want&quot;, as well as the ballad &quot;And If I Had&quot; were also hits. The debut album was quickly followed by &quot;Life Is a Song Worth Singing&quot;, in 1978. That album was even more successful with its singles &quot;Only You&quot; and the classic million selling number 1 R&amp;B hit &quot;Close the Door&quot;. The latter song firmly established Pendergrass as the top male sex symbol in soul music. The album&#x27;s popularity was furthered by the disco hit &quot;Get Up, Get Down, Get Funky, Get Loose&quot;, the ballad &quot;It Don&#x27;t Hurt Now&quot;, and the mid-tempo classic &quot;When Somebody Loves You Back&quot;. That double platinum number-one R&amp;B triumph was followed up in 1979 by two successes, the albums &quot;Teddy&quot; (which stayed at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart for eight weeks and was named the second-biggest R&amp;B album of the year), and the live release &quot;Live Coast to Coast&quot;. Hits off &quot;Teddy&quot; included the classics &quot;Come Go with Me&quot;, the erotic ballad &quot;Turn Off the Lights&quot;, and the uptempo album cut &quot;Do Me&quot;. With his sex appeal at an all-time high after his 1979 tour, Pendergrass took a more mellow approach on his 1980 album &quot;TP&quot;. It included the classic number two R&amp;B hit &quot;Love TKO&quot;, the Stephanie Mills duet version of &quot;Feel the Fire&quot; and the Ashford &amp; Simpson composition &quot;Is It Still Good to You&quot;. Between 1977 and 1981, Pendergrass landed five consecutive platinum albums, which was a then record-setting number for a rhythm and blues artist.

Pendergrass&#x27;s popularity became massive at the end of 1978. With sold-out audiences packing his shows, his manager, Shep Gordon, who was known for his innovative approaches to publicizing his artists, soon noticed that a huge number of his audience consisted of women of all races. Gordon devised a plan for Pendergrass&#x27;s next tour to play to just female audiences, starting a trend that continues today called &quot;women-only concerts&quot;. With four platinum albums and two gold albums, Pendergrass was on his way to being what the media called &quot;the black Elvis&quot;, not only in terms of his crossover popularity but also due to him buying a mansion akin to Elvis&#x27;s Graceland, located just outside his hometown of Philadelphia. By early 1982, Pendergrass was perhaps the leading R&amp;B male artist of his day, equaling the popularity of Marvin Gaye, and surpassing Barry White and all others in the R&amp;B field. In 1980, the Isley Brothers released &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Goodnight (It&#x27;s Time for Love)&quot; to compete with Pendergrass&#x27;s &quot;Turn Off the Lights&quot;, which sensed Pendergrass&#x27;s influence on the quiet storm format of black music.

===Car crash===
On March 18, 1982, in the East Falls section of Philadelphia on Lincoln Drive near Rittenhouse Street, Pendergrass was involved in a car crash while driving his new Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit. At the time of the accident, the singer&#x27;s license had been suspended for unpaid parking tickets (he had also wrecked a Maserati the previous week). Rumors that alcohol was a factor were later discounted by the police. Pendergrass was reportedly driving Tenika Watson, a transgender nightclub performer whom he had known since the 1970s, to her house. Pendergrass would only say that Watson was a casual acquaintance. It appeared to Watson that the cause of the crash was a mechanical error in the car, and that possibly someone had tampered with the brakes. The car hit a guard rail, crossed onto the oncoming lane, and hit two trees. No other vehicles were involved. The impact jammed the doors, trapping Pendergrass and Watson for almost an hour until both were freed. While Watson walked away from the collision with minor injuries, Pendergrass had a spinal cord injury, leaving him a tetraplegic, paralyzed from the chest down; he never walked again.

===Later solo career===
Pendergrass got well-wishes from thousands of his fans during his recovery. In August 1982, Philadelphia International released &quot;This One&#x27;s for You&quot;, which failed to chart successfully, as did 1983&#x27;s &quot;Heaven Only Knows&quot;. Both albums included material Pendergrass had recorded before the crash. The albums completed his contract with Philadelphia International. By the time Pendergrass decided to return to the studio to work on new music he had struggled to find a recording deal. Eventually signing a contract with Asylum Records and completing physical therapy, he released &quot;Love Language&quot; in 1984. The album included the pop ballad &quot;Hold Me&quot;, featuring a then-unknown Whitney Houston. It reached number 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

On July 13, 1985, Pendergrass made an emotional return to the stage at the historic Live Aid concert in Philadelphia in front of a live audience of over 100,000, the concert having an estimated 1.5 billion television viewers. It was the singer&#x27;s first live performance following the accident. Pendergrass tearfully thanked the audience for keeping him in their well-wishes and then performed the Diana Ross song &quot;Reach Out and Touch (Somebody&#x27;s Hand)&quot;. In 1988, Pendergrass scored his first R&amp;B number-one hit in nearly a decade when the song &quot;Joy&quot;, from his album of the same name, was released. A video of the song enjoyed heavy rotation on BET. It was also his final Hot 100 charted single, peaking at number 77. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA that same year. Also, Pendergrass&#x27;s voice was heard on the jingles of a then local Philadelphia radio station, WSNI-FM. Pendergrass kept recording through the 1990s. One of the singer&#x27;s last hits was the new jack swing song, &quot;Believe in Love&quot;, released in 1994. In 1996, he starred alongside Stephanie Mills in the touring production of the gospel musical &quot;Your Arms Too Short to Box with God&quot;. In 1998, Pendergrass released his autobiography titled &quot;Truly Blessed&quot;.

Pendergrass did a concert at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles on February 14, 2002, titled &quot;The Power of Love&quot;. The concert became the album &quot;From Teddy, With Love&quot;, which was released on the Razor &amp; Tie record label later that year. It was his second (after &quot;Live! Coast to Coast&quot;) and final live album. Clips of the concert, in particular his performance of his comeback song &quot;Joy&quot; can still be seen on YouTube. In his later years, Pendergrass&#x27;s &quot;Wake Up Everybody&quot; was covered by a diverse range of acts from Simply Red to Patti LaBelle and was chosen as a rallying cry during the 2004 Presidential campaign by Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds to mobilize voters. In addition, Little Brother, Kanye West, Cam&#x27;ron, Twista, Ghostface, Tyrese Gibson, 9th Wonder, DMX and DJ Green Lantern have utilized his works.

In 2006, Pendergrass announced his retirement from the music business. In 2007, he briefly returned to performing to participate in &quot;Teddy 25: A Celebration of Life, Hope &amp; Possibilities&quot;, a 25th anniversary awards ceremony that marked Pendergrass&#x27;s crash, but also raised money for his charity, The Teddy Pendergrass Alliance, and honored those who helped Pendergrass since the accident.

==Personal life and death==
Pendergrass had three children: Tisha, LaDonna, and Theodore Jr.

Pendergrass&#x27;s manager and girlfriend Taazmayia &quot;Taaz&quot; Lang was shot dead on the doorstep of her home in April 1977. The murder remains unsolved, although Philadelphia&#x27;s Black Mafia has been suspected, as they allegedly resented Lang&#x27;s control over Pendergrass&#x27;s lucrative career.

In June 1987, Pendergrass married a former Philadanco dancer named Karen Still, who had also danced in his shows. They divorced in 2002.

Pendergrass published his autobiography, &quot;Truly Blessed&quot;, with Patricia Romanowski in 1998.

In the spring of 2006, Pendergrass met Joan Williams. He proposed to her after four months, and they married in a private ceremony officiated by his pastor, Alyn Waller of Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church, on Easter Sunday, March 23, 2008. On September 6, 2008, a formal wedding was celebrated at The Ocean Cliff Resort in Newport, Rhode Island. As members of Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church, Joan Pendergrass set up The Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church Youth Fund in the name of Pendergrass to provide assistance and a center for Philadelphia&#x27;s inner city youth.

On June 5, 2009, Pendergrass underwent successful surgery for colon cancer and returned home to recover. A few weeks later he returned to the hospital with respiratory issues. After seven months, he died of respiratory failure on January 13, 2010, with his wife Joan by his side, at Bryn Mawr Hospital in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. He was 59. His body was interred at the West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

As of 2015, there are plans to make a feature film biopic of Pendergrass&#x27;s life, and Tyrese Gibson is set to star as the late singer. In 2019, &quot;Essence Magazine&quot; reported that Gibson reached out to Lee Daniels to produce the film.

In 2019, BBC Film made a documentary on Pendergrass&#x27;s life titled &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot;. It was released February 8 on Showtime.

Its website, Scotsman.com, had an average of 138,000 unique visitors a day as of 2017. The title celebrated its bicentenary on 25 January 2017.

==History==

&quot;The Scotsman&quot; was conceived in 1816 and first launched on 25 January 1817 as a liberal weekly newspaper by lawyer William Ritchie and customs official Charles Maclaren in response to the &quot;unblushing subservience&quot; of competing newspapers to the Edinburgh establishment. These two plus John Ramsay McCulloch were co-founders of the venture. 

The paper was pledged to &quot;impartiality, firmness and independence&quot;. The price was originally 6d plus 4d tax. After the abolition of newspaper stamp tax in Scotland in 1855, &quot;The Scotsman&quot; was relaunched as a daily newspaper priced at 1d and a circulation of 6,000 copies.

The fledgling paper was originally based at 257 High Street on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. Until 1860 the Scotsman shared a building with the Caledonian Mercury newspaper.

In 1860, The Scotsman obtained its own purpose built office on Cockburn Street in Edinburgh designed in the Scots baronial style by the architects Peddie &amp; Kinnear. This backed onto their original offices on the Royal Mile. The building bears the initials &quot;JR&quot; for John Ritchie, the founder of the company. On 19 December 1904, they moved to much larger new offices at the top of Cockburn Street, facing onto North Bridge, designed by Dunn &amp; Findlay (Findlay being the son of the then owner). This huge building had taken three years to build and also had connected printworks on Market Street (in 2024 the City Art Centre). The printworks connected below road level direct to Waverley station in an efficient production line.

In 1953 the newspaper was bought by Canadian millionaire Roy Thomson who was in the process of building a large media group. The paper was bought in 1995 by David and Frederick Barclay for £85 million. They moved the newspaper from its Edinburgh office on North Bridge, which is now an upmarket hotel, to modern offices in Holyrood Road designed by Edinburgh architects CDA, near the subsequent location of the Scottish Parliament Building.

The daily was awarded by the Society for News Design (SND) the World&#x27;s Best Designed Newspaper for 1994.

In December 2005, &quot;The Scotsman&quot; along with its sister titles owned by The Scotsman Publications Ltd was acquired, in a £160million deal, by Johnston Press, a company founded in Scotland and at the time one of the top three largest local newspaper publishers in the UK. Ian Stewart has been the editor since June 2012, after a reshuffle of senior management in April 2012 during which John McLellan who was the paper&#x27;s editor-in-chief was dismissed. Ian Stewart was previously editor of &quot;Edinburgh Evening News&quot; and remains as the editor of &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;The Scotsman&quot; was named Newspaper of the Year at the Scottish Press Awards.

In 2006 the Barclay Brothers sold Barclay House to Irish property magnate Lochlann Quinn, and in 2013 Scottish video games maker Rockstar North, of Grand Theft Auto fame, signed the lease, causing Johnston Press group to move out in June 2014. Johnston Press have downsized to refurbished premises at Orchard Brae House in Queensferry Road, Edinburgh, a move which was quoted as saving the group £1million per annum in rent.

The newspaper backed a &#x27;No&#x27; vote in the referendum on Scottish independence.

In November 2018, Johnston Press filed for administration. Shortly after filing for administration, the company was bought out by JPIMedia, a company which was bought by former &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; exec David Montgomery&#x27;s new National World group in 2020.

In July 2023 an extra 52 years were added to the archive alongside the previous archives (1951–2002).

<doc id="518437" wikidata="Q18970" url="?curid=518437" title="Ambon, Maluku">
<text>Ambon (formerly ) is the capital and largest city of the Indonesian province of Maluku. This city is also known as , which means &quot;beautiful&quot; or &quot;pretty&quot; Ambon in the Ambonese language. It covers a land area of 359.45 km2, and had a population of 331,254 at the 2010 Census and 347,288 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 354,052. The city is divided into five administrative districts () – namely Nusaniwe, Sirimau, Teluk Ambon (Ambon Bay), Baguala (officially Teluk Ambon Baguala) and Leitimur Selatan (South Leitimur). Known as Indonesia&#x27;s music city, Ambon became the first city in Southeast Asia to be recognised as the UNESCO City of Music in 2019.

The city is populated by a mix of ethnic Alifuru (original Moluccans), Javanese, Balinese, Butonese, Bugis, Makassar, Papuan, Minahasa, Minang, Flobamora (Flores, Sumba, Alor and Timor ethnics) and those of foreign descent (Chinese, Arabian-Ambonese, Spanish-Ambonese, German-Ambonese, Portuguese-Ambonese and Dutch-Ambonese). Between 1999 and 2002, there was social unrest motivated by racial intolerance.

==History==

===Colonial era===

Ambon was colonized by Portugal in 1526 and originally named &quot;Nossa Senhora de Anunciada&quot;, founded by Portuguese-Moluccan Governor &quot;Sancho de Vasconcelos&quot;. The Portuguese were driven out by the Dutch in 1605. Except for brief periods of British rule, the island remained under Dutch control until Indonesia&#x27;s independence in 1945.
During the Dutch period, Ambon was the seat of the Dutch resident and military commander of the Maluku Islands. The town was protected by Fort Victoria, and the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; characterized it as &quot;a clean little town with wide streets, well planted&quot;. The population was divided into two classes, &quot;orang burger&quot; (citizens) and &quot;orang negri&quot; (villagers), the former being a class of native origin enjoying certain privileges conferred on their ancestors by the old Dutch East India Company. There were also, besides the Dutch, some Arabs, Chinese and a few Portuguese settlers. Ambon was a center of Christian missionary activity, and Ambon and the surrounding islands have many Christians as well as the Muslims that predominate in most of Indonesia.

On 22 December 1902, the Apostolic Prefecture of Dutch New Guinea was established in the city, later to be promoted as the Diocese of Amboina.
Ambon Island was the site of a major Dutch naval base and was of strategic importance during WW2. In 1941, Dutch forces with the assistance of Australian forces reinforced Ambon in anticipation of a Japanese attack. Japanese forces attacked Ambon as part of their attack on the Dutch East Indies. Despite formidable defenses, Ambon fell when its defenders surrendered after four days of fighting on 3 February 1942. Following the battle, Japanese forces committed numerous acts of atrocities, including the execution of over 300 Dutch and Australian POWs at Laha airfield.

===Conflicts since independence===
In 1950 Ambon was the center of an uprising against Indonesian rule, caused by the self-proclaimed Republic of the South Moluccas. Indonesian troops invaded the city during the Invasion of Ambon and reasserted control in just a few months. Many important buildings such as the Victoria Fort (APRMS main base) were heavily damaged during the confrontation.

In April and May 1958 during the Permesta rebellion in North Sulawesi, the USA supported and supplied the rebels. Pilots from a Taiwan-based CIA front organisation, Civil Air Transport, flying CIA B-26 Invader aircraft, repeatedly bombed and machine-gunned targets in and around Ambon. On 27 April a CIA raid set fire to a military command post, a fuel dump and a Royal Dutch Shell complex. The attack on Shell was deliberate: the CIA had orders to hit foreign commercial interests in order to drive foreign trade away from Indonesia and undermine its economy. The next day, the same CIA pilot bombed Shell interests at Balikpapan in East Kalimantan on Borneo, which persuaded Shell to suspend tanker services from there.

On 28 April a CIA air raid damaged an Indonesian Army barracks next to a marketplace. On 30 April a CIA air raid hit the airstrip. On 7 May a CIA air raid attacked Ambon airstrip, seriously damaging a Douglas C-47 Skytrain and an Indonesian Air Force North American P-51 Mustang and setting fire to a number of fuel drums. On 8 May a CIA B-26 tried to bomb an Indonesian Navy gunboat in Ambon harbour. Its bomb missed but it then machine-gunned the boat, wounding two crew. The Indonesian National Armed Forces reinforced Ambon City&#x27;s anti-aircraft defences with a number of machine guns. On 9 May a CIA B-26 attacked the city again. The machine-gunners returned fire and an Indonesian Air Force P-51 Mustang chased the B-26, but it escaped.

On 15 May a CIA B-26 attacked a small ship, the &quot;Naiko&quot;, in Ambon Bay. The &quot;Naiko&quot; was a merchant ship that the Indonesian Government had pressed into military service, and she was bringing a company of Ambonese troops home from East Java. A CIA bomb hit the &quot;Naiko&quot;″s engine room, killing one crew member and 16 infantrymen and setting the ship on fire. The B-26 then attacked Ambon city, aiming for the barracks. Its first bomb missed and exploded in a market-place next door. The next landed in the barracks compound but bounced and exploded near an ice factory. The B-26 in the May air raids was flown by a CAT pilot called Allen Pope. On 18 May Pope attacked Ambon again. First he raided the airstrip again, destroying the C-47 and P-51 that he had damaged on 7 May. Then he flew west of the city and tried to attack one of a pair of troop ships being escorted by the Indonesian Navy. Indonesian forces shot down the B-26 but Pope and his Indonesian radio operator survived and were captured. Pope&#x27;s capture immediately exposed the level of CIA support for the Permesta rebellion. Embarrassed, the Eisenhower administration quickly ended CIA support for Permesta and withdrew its agents and remaining aircraft from the conflict.

As part of the transmigration program in the 1980s, the Suharto government relocated many migrants, most of them Muslim, from densely overpopulated Java.

Between 1999 and 2002, Ambon was at the centre of sectarian conflict across the Maluku Islands. There was further religious violence in 2011.

The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of administrative villages in each district (totaling 20 urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;, 20 &quot;negari&quot; and 10 rural &quot;desa&quot;), and its post codes.
Notes: (a) comprising 8 &quot;kelurahan&quot; and 5 &quot;negeri&quot;. (b) comprising 10 &quot;kelurahan&quot;, 3 &quot;negeri&quot; and one &quot;desa&quot;. &lt;br&gt;(c) comprising 1 &quot;kelurahan&quot;, 2 &quot;negeri&quot; and 4 &quot;desa&quot;. (d) comprising 1 &quot;kelurahan&quot;, 2 &quot;negeri&quot; and 5 &quot;desa&quot;. (e) all &quot;negeri&quot;.

Like other regions in the (Maluku Islands), areas in Ambon are still considered to have the status of states, led by kings and queens.

===Nusanive===
Nusanive District consists of the western part of the Leitimur Peninsula. The eight urban &quot;kelurahan&quot; form part of the built-up area of Ambon city in the centre of the north shore of that peninsula, while the eight &quot;negeri&quot; (&quot;desa&quot;) consist of the more rural areas to the west and south of that core. Three of these &quot;negeri&quot; have the same names as &quot;kelurahan&quot; in the core.

===Sirimau===
Sirimau District consists of the north-central part of the Leitimur Peninsula, and thus equates roughly to the core of the Ambon city built-up area. 

===Teluk Ambon Baguala or simply Baguala===
Teluk Ambon Baguala District (usually shortened to Baguala District) consists of the northeastern part of the Leitimur Peninsula, together with the isthmus connecting it to the main (Leihitu) portion of the island and the adjoining part of Leihitu.
===Teluk Ambon===
Teluk Ambon District consists entirely of a portion of Leihitu (and thus not including any part of the Leitimur Peninsula), and faces the core area of the city across Ambon Bay. 

===Leitimur Selatan===
Leitimur Selatan District consists of the southeastern and eastern parts of the Leitimur Peninsula.

<text>Kathryn Tickell, OBE, DL (born 8 June 1967) is an English musician, noted for playing the Northumbrian smallpipes and fiddle.

==Music career==
===Early life===
Kathryn Tickell was born in Walsall, to parents who originated from Northumberland and who moved back there from Staffordshire with the family when Kathryn was seven. Her paternal grandfather played accordion, fiddle, and organ. Her father, Mike Tickell, sings and her mother played the concertina. Her first instrument was piano when she was six. A year later, she picked up a set of Northumbrian smallpipes brought home by her father, who intended them for someone else. Frustrated by fiddle and piano, she learned that the pipes rewarded her effort. She was inspired by older musicians such as Willy Taylor, Will Atkinson, Joe Hutton, and Billy Pigg.

===Performing and recording===

At thirteen, she had gained a reputation from performing in festivals and winning pipe contests. When she was seventeen, she released her first album, &quot;On Kielder Side&quot; (Saydisc, 1984), which she recorded at her parents&#x27; house. During the same year, she was named Official Piper to the Lord Mayor of Newcastle, an office that had been vacant for 13 years, since George Atkinson&#x27;s appointment for a single year in 1971. She formed the Kathryn Tickell Band, with Karen Tweed on accordion, bass, and Ian Carr on guitar, and released the band&#x27;s first album in 1991 on Black Crow Records. Later, the band comprised Peter Tickell on fiddle, Julian Sutton on melodeon, and Joss Clapp on guitar. In 2001, the Kathryn Tickell Band was the first band to play traditional folk music at the Promenade Concerts in London.

She recorded with the Penguin Cafe Orchestra, led by Simon Jeffes. She met Jeffes while she was in her teens, and he wrote the song &quot;Organum&quot; for her. Over a decade after Jeffes&#x27;s death, she played with Penguin Cafe, run by his son, Arthur.

Tickell has also recorded with The Chieftains, The Boys of the Lough, Jon Lord, Jimmy Nail, Linda Thompson, Alan Parsons, and Andy Sheppard. She has performed live with Sting, who is also from Newcastle upon Tyne, and has recorded with him on his albums &quot;The Soul Cages&quot; (1991), &quot;Ten Summoner&#x27;s Tales&quot; (1993), &quot;Mercury Falling&quot; (1996), &quot;Brand New Day&quot;, (1999), &quot;If on a Winter&#x27;s Night&quot; (2009), and &quot;The Last Ship&quot; (2013).

Two ex-members of the North East England traditional music group the High Level Ranters have appeared on her albums: Tom Gilfellon on &quot;On Kielder Side&quot; and Alistair Anderson on &quot;Borderlands&quot; (1986). The latter album included to a tribute to the Wark football team. Several other pipers have appeared on her albums: Troy Donockley on &quot;Debatable Lands&quot;, Patrick Molard on &quot;The Gathering&quot; and Martyn Bennett on &quot;Borderlands&quot;. &quot;Debatable Lands&quot; included &quot;Our Kate&quot;, a composition by Kathryn Tickell dedicated to Catherine Cookson.

In 2011, she took part in the Sunderland A.F.C. charity Foundation of Light event.

She formed Kathryn Tickell and the Side, with Ruth Wall on Celtic harp, Louisa Tuck on cello, and Amy Thatcher on accordion. The group plays a mixture of traditional and classical music. They released an eponymous album in 2014.

In 2018 Tickell established a new band, Kathryn Tickell &amp; The Darkening, with whom she released the album &quot;Hollowbone&quot; in 2019. This project signals a different approach, with new material. There is a semi-imaginary incursion into the prehistory of Northumbrian music in the track &quot;Nemesis&quot; based on Roman-era texts and a melody by Emperor Hadrian’s court musician Mesomedes. There is a foray into a world of ancestral shamanism in &quot;O-u-t Spells Out&quot;. The album was greeted with critical acclaim, with four-star reviews in &quot;The Observer&quot; and the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, as were the band&#x27;s various national tours in its first two years of existence.

===Other projects===
In 1987, the early part of her career was chronicled in &quot;The Long Tradition&quot;, a TV documentary. &quot;Kathryn Tickell&#x27;s Northumbria&quot;, another documentary, appeared in 2006. In 1997, Tickell founded the Young Musicians Fund of the Tyne and Wear Foundation to provide money to young people in northeastern England who wanted to learn music. She founded the Festival of the North East and from 2009 to 2013 was the artistic director of Folkworks.

She is also a regular presenter for BBC Radio 3&#x27;s weekly world music programme &quot;Music Planet&quot;.

<text>A mongrel, mutt, or mixed-breed dog is a dog that does not belong to one officially recognized breed, including those that result from intentional breeding. Although the term &quot;mixed-breed dog&quot; is sometimes preferred, many mongrels have no known purebred ancestors. 

Crossbreed dogs, and &quot;designer dogs&quot;, while also a mix of breeds, differ from mongrels in being intentionally bred. At other times, the word &quot;mongrel&quot; has been applied to informally purpose-bred dogs such as curs, which were created at least in part from mongrels, especially if the breed is not officially recognized.

Although mongrels are viewed as of less commercial value than intentionally bred dogs, they are thought to be less susceptible to genetic health problems associated with inbreeding (based on the theory of heterosis), and have enthusiasts and defenders who prefer them to intentionally bred dogs.

Estimates place the prevalence of mongrels at 150 million animals worldwide.

==Terminology==
===Mixed-breed and crossbreed===

In the United States, the term &quot;mixed-breed&quot; is a favored synonym over &quot;mongrel&quot; among people who wish to avoid negative connotations associated with the latter term. The implication that such dogs must be a mix of defined breeds may stem from an inverted understanding of the origins of dog breeds. Purebred dogs have been, for the most part, artificially created from random-bred populations by human selective breeding with the purpose of enhancing desired physical, behavioral, or temperamental characteristics. Dogs that are not &quot;purebred&quot; are not necessarily a mix of such defined breeds. Therefore, among some experts and fans of such dogs, &quot;mongrel&quot; is still the preferred term.

Dog crossbreeds, sometimes called &quot;designer dogs&quot;, also are not members of a single recognized breed. Unlike mixed-breeds, crossbreed dogs are often the product of artificial selection – intentionally created by humans, whereas the term &quot;mongrel&quot; specifically refers to dogs that develop by natural selection, without the planned intervention of humans.

===Regional and slang terms===

The words &quot;cur&quot;, &quot;tyke&quot;, &quot;mutt&quot;, and &quot;mongrel&quot; are used, sometimes in a derogatory manner. There are also regional terms for mixed-breed dogs. In the United Kingdom, &quot;mongrel&quot; is the unique technical word for a mixed-breed dog. North Americans generally prefer the term &quot;mix&quot; or &quot;mixed-breed&quot;. &quot;Mutt&quot; is also commonly used in the United States and Canada. Some American registries and dog clubs that accept mixed-breed dogs use the term &quot;All-American&quot; to describe mixed-breed dogs.

There are also names for mixed-breeds based on geography, behavior, or food. In Hawaii, mixes are referred to as poi dogs, although they are not related to the extinct Hawaiian Poi Dog. In the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands, the common term is &quot;potcake dogs&quot; (referring to the table scraps they are fed). In South Africa, the tongue-in-cheek expression &quot;pavement special&quot; is sometimes used as a description for a mixed-breed dog. In Trinidad and Tobago, these mixed dogs are referred to as &quot;pot hounds&quot; (&quot;pothong&quot;). In Serbia, a similar expression is &quot;prekoplotski avlijaner&quot; (&quot;over-the-fence yard-dweller&quot;). In Russia, a colloquial term &quot;дворняга&quot; (yard-dweller) is used most commonly. In the Philippines, mixed-breed street dogs are often called &quot;askal&quot;, a Tagalog-derived contraction of &quot;asong kalye&quot; (”street dog&quot;), while in Singapore, they are known as Singapore Specials. In Puerto Rico, they are known as &quot;satos&quot;; in Venezuela they are called &quot;yusos&quot; or &quot;cacris&quot;, the latter being a contraction of the words &quot;callejero criollo&quot; (literally, street creole, as street dogs are usually mongrels); and in Chile and Bolivia, they are called &quot;quiltros&quot;. In Costa Rica, it is common to hear the word &quot;zaguate&quot;, a term originating from a Nahuatl term, &quot;zahuatl&quot;, that refers to the disease called scabies. In the rural southern United States, a small hunting dog is known as a feist. In Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, they are called &quot;malix&quot; (ma.liʃ), meaning &quot;no breed&quot; in mayan language.

Slang terms are also common. &quot;Heinz 57&quot;, Heinz, or Heinz Hound is often used for dogs of uncertain ancestry, in a playful reference to the &quot;57 Varieties&quot; slogan of the H. J. Heinz Company. In some countries, such as Australia, &quot;bitsa&quot; (or &quot;bitzer&quot;) is sometimes used, meaning &quot;bits o&#x27; this, bits o&#x27; that&quot;. In Brazil and the Dominican Republic, the name for mixed-breed dogs is &quot;vira-lata&quot; (&quot;trash-can tipper&quot;) because of homeless dogs who knock over trash cans to reach discarded food. In Newfoundland, a smaller mixed-breed dog is known as a &quot;cracky&quot;, hence the colloquial expression &quot;saucy as a cracky&quot; for someone with a sharp tongue. In Sweden these dogs might be humorously referred to as a &quot;gatu korsning&quot;, which translates to intersection, but literally to &#x27;street crossing&#x27;.

==Determining ancestry==

Guessing a mixed-breed&#x27;s ancestry can be difficult even for knowledgeable dog observers, because mixed-breeds have much more genetic variation than purebreds. For example, two black mixed-breed dogs might each have recessive genes that produce a blond coat and, therefore, produce offspring looking unlike their parents.

Starting in 2007, genetic analysis has become available to the public. The companies claim their DNA-based diagnostic test can genetically determine the breed composition of mixed-breed dogs. These tests are still limited in scope because only a small number of the hundreds of dog breeds have been validated against the tests, and because the same breed in different geographical areas may have different genetic profiles. The tests do not test for breed purity, but for genetic sequences that are common to certain breeds. With a mixed-breed dog, the test is not proof of purebred ancestry, but rather an indication that those dogs share common ancestry with certain purebreds. The American Kennel Club does not recognize the use of DNA tests to determine breed.

Many newer dog breeds can be traced back to a common foundational breed, making them difficult to separate genetically. For example, Labrador Retrievers, Flat-coated Retrievers, Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, and Newfoundland dogs share a common ancestry with the St. John&#x27;s water dog – a now-extinct naturally occurring dog landrace from the island of Newfoundland.

==Health==

The theory of hybrid vigor suggests that as a group, dogs of varied ancestry will be generally healthier than their purebred counterparts. In purebred dogs, intentionally breeding dogs of very similar appearance over several generations produces animals that carry many of the same alleles, some of which are detrimental. If the founding population for the breed was small, then the genetic diversity of that particular breed may be small for quite some time. 

When humans select certain dogs for new breeds, they artificially isolate that group of genes and cause more copies of that gene to be made than might have otherwise occurred in nature. The population is initially more fragile because of the lack of genetic diversity. If the dog breed is popular, and the line continues, over hundreds of years diversity increases due to mutations and occasional out-breeding. This is why some of the very old breeds are more stable. One issue is when certain traits found in the breed standard are associated with genetic disorders. The artificial selective force favors the duplication of the genetic disorder because it comes with a desired physical trait. The genetic health of hybrids tends to be higher. Healthy traits have been lost in many purebred dog lines because many breeders of showdogs are more interested in conformation – the physical attributes of the dogs in relation to the breed standard – than in the health and working temperament for which the dog was originally bred.

Populations are vulnerable when the dogs bred are closely related. Inbreeding among purebreds has exposed various genetic health problems not always readily apparent in less uniform populations. Mixed-breed dogs are more genetically diverse due to the more haphazard nature of their parents&#x27; mating. The offspring of such matings might be less likely to express certain genetic disorders because there might be a decreased chance that both parents carry the same detrimental recessive alleles, but some recessives occur across many seemingly unrelated breeds, and therefore merely mixing breeds is no guarantee of genetic health. When two poor specimens are bred, the offspring could inherit the worst traits of both parents. This is commonly seen in dogs that came from puppy mills.

Several studies have shown that mixed-breed dogs have a health advantage over purebred dogs. A German study finds that &quot;mongrels require less veterinary treatment&quot;. Studies in Sweden have found that &quot;Mongrel dogs are less prone to many diseases than the average purebred dog&quot; and, when referring to death rates, that &quot;mongrels were consistently in the low risk category&quot;. Data from Denmark also suggest that mixed breeds have greater longevity on average compared to purebreds.
 A British study showed similar results, but a few breeds (notably Jack Russell Terriers, Miniature Poodles and Whippets) lived longer than mixed breeds.

In one study, the effect of breed on longevity in the pet dog was analyzed using mortality data from 23,535 pet dogs. The data were obtained from North American veterinary teaching hospitals. The median age at death was determined for purebred and mixed-breed dogs of different body weights. Within each body weight category, the median age at death was lower for purebred dogs compared with mixed-breed dogs. The median age at death was &quot;8.5 years for all mixed breed dogs, and 6.7 years for all pure breed dogs&quot; in the study.

In 2013, a study found that mixed breeds live on average 1.2 years longer than purebreds, and that increasing body weight was negatively correlated with longevity (i.e. the heavier the dog, the shorter its lifespan). Another study published in 2019 confirmed this 1.2 year difference in lifespan for mixed-breed dogs, and further demonstrated negative impacts of recent inbreeding and benefits of occasional outcrossing for lifespan in individual dogs.

Studies that have been done in the area of health show that mixed-breeds on average are both healthier and longer-lived than their purebred relations. This is because current accepted breeding practices within the pedigreed dog community result in a reduction in genetic diversity, and can result in physical characteristics that lead to health issues.

Studies have shown that crossbreed dogs have a number of desirable reproductive traits. Scott and Fuller found that crossbreed dogs were superior mothers compared to purebred mothers, producing more milk and giving better care. These advantages led to a decreased mortality in the offspring of crossbreed dogs.

<doc id="518447" wikidata="Q1457398" url="?curid=518447" title="Mutt (email client)">
<text>Mutt is a text-based email client for Unix-like systems. It was originally written by Michael Elkins in 1995 and released under the GNU General Public License version 2 or any later version.

The Mutt slogan is &quot;All mail clients suck. This one just sucks less.&quot;

==Operation==
Mutt supports most mail storing formats (notably both mbox and Maildir) and protocols (POP3, IMAP, etc.). It also includes MIME support, notably full PGP/GPG and S/MIME integration.

Mutt was originally designed as a Mail User Agent (MUA) and relied on locally accessible mailbox and sendmail infrastructure. According to the Mutt homepage &quot;though written from scratch, Mutt&#x27;s initial interface was based largely on the ELM mail client&quot;. New to Mutt were message scoring and threading capabilities. Support for fetching and sending email via various protocols such as POP3, IMAP and SMTP was added later. However, Mutt still relies on external tools for composing and filtering messages.

Mutt has hundreds of configuration directives and commands. It allows for changing all the key bindings and making keyboard macros for complex actions, as well as the colors and the layout of most of the interface. Through variants of a concept known as &quot;hooks&quot;, many of its settings can be changed based on criteria such as current mailbox or outgoing message recipients. Mutt supports an optional sidebar, similar to those often found in graphical mail clients. There are also many patches and extensions available that add functionality, such as NNTP support.

Mutt is fully controlled with the keyboard, and has support for mail conversation threading, meaning one can easily move around long discussions such as in mailing lists. New messages are composed with an external text editor, unlike pine, which embeds its own editor known as pico.

Mutt is capable of efficiently searching mail stores by calling on mail indexing tools such as Notmuch, and many people recommend Mutt be used this way. Alternatively, users can search their mail stores from Mutt by calling grep via a Bash script.

Mutt is often used by security professionals or security-conscious users because of its smaller attack surface compared with other clients that ship with a web browser rendering engine or a JavaScript interpreter. In relation to Transport Layer Security, Mutt can be configured to trust certificates on first use, and not to use older, less secure versions of the Transport Layer Security protocol.

He was nicknamed &quot;the Spanish Mozart&quot; after he died, because, like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, he was both a child prodigy and an accomplished composer who died young. They also shared the same first and second baptismal names; and they shared the same birthday (due to both having been born on the feast of St. John Chrysostom), 27 January (fifty years apart).

==Life==
Juan Crisóstomo Arriaga was born in Bilbao, Biscay, on what would have been Mozart&#x27;s fiftieth birthday. His father (Juan Simón de Arriaga) and the boy&#x27;s older brother first taught him music. Juan Simón had some musical talent and at age seventeen Juan Crisóstomo was an organist at a church in Berriatúa. Juan Simón worked in Guernica and in 1804 moved to Bilbao and became a merchant in wool, rice, wax, coffee and other commodities. The income generated in this way allowed Juan Simón to think about providing his son, who had shown prodigious musical talent, a way of developing those gifts.

In September 1821, Arriaga&#x27;s father, with the encouragement of composer José Sobejano y Ayala (1791–1857), sent Juan Crisóstomo to Paris, where in November of that year Arriaga began his studies. These included violin under Pierre Baillot, counterpoint with Luigi Cherubini and harmony under François-Joseph Fétis at the Paris Conservatoire. From all evidence, Arriaga made quite an impression on his teachers. In 1823, Cherubini, who had become director at the Conservatoire the previous year, famously asked on hearing the young composer&#x27;s &quot;Stabat Mater&quot;, &quot;Who wrote this?&quot; and learning it was Arriaga, said to him, &quot;Amazing – you are music itself.&quot;

Arriaga soon became a teaching assistant in Fétis&#x27;s class, noted and highly praised both by fellow students and other faculty at the Conservatoire for his talent. Cherubini referred to Arriaga&#x27;s fugue for eight voices (lost) based on the &quot;Credo ... et vitam venturi&quot; simply as &quot;a masterpiece&quot;, and Fétis was no less effusive — apparently, what impressed all his mentors was his use of sophisticated harmonies, counterpoint and fugue with minimal or no formal instruction. Fétis was already familiar with Arriaga&#x27;s now-lost opera &quot;Los Esclavos Felices&quot; (&quot;The Happy Slaves&quot;), stating that &quot;without any knowledge whatsoever of harmony, Juan Crisóstomo wrote a Spanish opera containing wonderful and completely original ideas.&quot; Arriaga was well supported during his four years in Paris by his father, but the intensity of his commitment to his studies at the Conservatoire and his meteoric rise, based on his teachers&#x27; compliments and assessments of his promise, may have taken a toll on his health: he died in Paris ten days before his twentieth birthday, of a lung ailment (possibly tuberculosis), or exhaustion, perhaps both. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the Montmartre Cemetery. Thanks to the Spanish Embassy, since 1977 there has been a plaque marking the house at 314 rue Saint-Honoré in memory of the composer.

==Music==
The amount of Arriaga&#x27;s music that has survived to the present day is quite small, reflecting his early death. It includes:

* Opera: Arriaga wrote an opera, &quot;Los esclavos felices&quot; (&quot;The Happy Slaves&quot;), in 1820 when he was fourteen. It was produced in Bilbao. Only the overture and some fragments have survived.
* Symphony: Arriaga composed a &quot;Symphony in D for Large Orchestra&quot; (&quot;Sinfonía a gran orquesta&quot;), which uses D major and D minor so equally that it is not in either key.
* String quartets: At the age of 16, Arriaga wrote three string quartets that were published in 1824, and were the only works of his published during his lifetime.
* Other works: Arriaga also wrote the following:
** An octet, &quot;Nada y mucho&quot; scored for String Quartet, Bass, Trumpet, Guitar and Piano.
** Pieces of church music: a Mass (lost), Stabat Mater, Salve Regina, &quot;Et vitam venturi saeculi&quot; (lost), cantatas (&quot;Agar&quot;, &quot;Erminia&quot;, &quot;All&#x27; Aurora&quot;, &quot;Patria&quot;)
** Instrumental compositions: a nonet, Tres Estudios de Character for piano, &quot;La Húngara&quot; for violin and piano, Variations for String Quartet and numerous Romances

Arriaga&#x27;s music was used to create an opera pasticcio, &quot;Die arabische Prinzessin&quot;. The work was commissioned by the Barenboim-Said Foundation from the composer Anna-Sophie Brüning and the author Paula Fünfeck, and is based on a traditional Arabic tale. The piece was premiered under the title &quot;Die Sultana von Cadiz&quot; by the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra of the Barenboim-Said Foundation and local children&#x27;s choirs at the Cultural Palace, Ramallah on 14 July 2009. The music publisher Boosey &amp; Hawkes lists further performance runs in Leipzig (in 2011); in Bonn, Bilbao, and Barañáin (in 2013); and in Madrid, Coburg, and Linz (in 2014).

==Stature==
Arriaga&#x27;s music is &quot;elegant, accomplished and notable for its harmonic warmth&quot; (&quot;New Grove Concise Dictionary of Music&quot;). His greatest works are undoubtedly the three string quartets, which (like his predecessors&#x27;, D. Scarlatti, Soler and Boccherini) contain notably Spanish ethnic rhythmic and melodic elements, especially in the galloping 6/8 finale of No. 1 in D minor and the meditative second (slow) movements of No. 2 in A major (an impressive set of variations in D major taking off from the slow D major variation movements in Mozart&#x27;s K. 464 and Beethoven&#x27;s Op. 18 No. 5 (both also in A major as a whole), which climaxes in a D minor variation even more passionate than Mozart&#x27;s D minor variation in K. 464, in the form of an impassioned, plangent lament on the top two strings of the viola going up to the second A above middle C) and No. 3 in E-flat major (a tender G major lullaby for the newborn Christ child). Periodwise, his style is on the borderline between late Classicism and early Romanticism, ranging from the late Classical idiom of Mozart to the proto-Romanticism of early Beethoven.

According to Grove, Arriaga&#x27;s death &quot;before he was 20 was a sad loss to Basque music&quot;. Following his early death, with the only reliable biographical material at the time being some reports by Fétis, his life story was fictionalized to play into rising Basque nationalism. Data on the composer remains scarce, but in 1989 the Basque Studies program at the University of Nevada, Reno published the only English language biography of Arriaga, with appendix and bibliography of works, written by Barbara Rosen (&quot;Arriaga, the Forgotten Genius: the Short Life of a Basque Composer&quot;); and in honor of the 200th anniversary of Arriaga&#x27;s birth, &quot;Scherzo&quot;, the Spanish musical magazine, published a series of articles on the composer, with updated bibliographies, in its January 2006 issue. The view that emerges from both these newer sources does not contradict what Fétis said, but emphasizes that Arriaga&#x27;s early death was a loss not just to Basque culture but also to Spanish music and by extension, European classical music as a whole. According to Rosen &quot;It is [...] possible to hear passages in Arriaga&#x27;s work similar to Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Rossini, although he sometimes fails to achieve the complexity of these composers&#x27; more mature works. Nevertheless, Arriaga has an identifiable and original style which, in time, undoubtedly would have become more individual and more recognizably his own, possibly incorporating more Spanish and Basque than Viennese elements.&quot;

A public theatre in his home city of Bilbao carries his name.

<doc id="518454" wikidata="Q1416624" url="?curid=518454" title="The Teen Idles">
<text>The Teen Idles were an American hardcore punk band formed in Washington, D.C., in September 1979. Consisting of teenagers Nathan Strejcek, Geordie Grindle, Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, they recorded two demo sessions and the 1980 &quot;Minor Disturbance&quot; EP before breaking up in November 1980. The influential independent record label Dischord Records was originally created with the sole purpose of releasing The Teen Idles &quot;Minor Disturbance&quot; 7&quot; record. They were an early landmark in the D.C. hardcore movement, and MacKaye and Nelson would later form the seminal punk rock outfit Minor Threat.

The Teen Idles were among the first punk groups from the early 1980s hardcore movement to break out of their regional scene to tour and sell nationally. Inspired by other American punk bands like the Cramps and Bad Brains, the Teen Idles&#x27; music was an early version of hardcore punk, and an attempt, in the words of MacKaye, &quot;to get away from a really corrupted music&quot;. Their appearance, lyrics and musical style sought to revive a punk movement that they believed had lost its original zeal.

==History==
===Formation===
In 1978, Washington teenager MacKaye discovered punk rock through a local college radio station, Georgetown University&#x27;s WGTB. He met Nelson, a classmate of his at Woodrow Wilson High School, after Nelson set off a pipe bomb outside their school and MacKaye went to investigate. The two became friends and quickly discovered their shared interest in punk. MacKaye and Nelson saw their first punk show in January 1979—a benefit concert by the Cramps for WGTB. The concert inspired the pair; MacKaye later admitted, &quot;It blew my mind because I saw for the first time this huge, totally invisible community that had gathered together for this tribal event. [...] I thought, &#x27;This appeals to me. This is the world I think I can breathe in. This is what I need&#x27;&quot;.

After seeing a Bad Brains concert, MacKaye and Nelson began playing in a punk band, The Slinkees, with school friends Grindle and Mark Sullivan. The Slinkees played a single show before Sullivan went to college. After a failed attempt to recruit MacKaye&#x27;s friend Henry Garfield (later Henry Rollins), the band added Strejcek as the vocalist. The Slinkees soon renamed themselves the Teen Idles. After touring and practicing for several months, the band recorded two demo sessions at a local studio in February and April 1980, despite the engineer and a visiting band openly laughing as they recorded. They also began playing at house parties and pizza parlors, and opened for Bad Brains at an art gallery, in a dilapidated row house in the Adams-Morgan neighborhood, called Madam&#x27;s Organ.

===Appearance===

To revive the fervor of punk, which the band felt was being distorted by new wave, the Idles sought to look as intimidating as possible. They shaved their heads, grew mohawks and wore various punk accessories. Nelson and MacKaye even drove thumbtacks into the soles of their boots so they would make an &quot;ominous clacking&quot; sound when they walked. The band&#x27;s visual presentation was at odds with their demeanor; according to MacKaye, &quot;In our shows and within our own community, we were totally goofy guys. We were painfully honest—we didn&#x27;t shoplift, we didn&#x27;t vandalize, we didn&#x27;t spray-paint. [...] We don&#x27;t do anything—everybody just hates us because of the way we look&quot;.

=== The Music ===
The members of Teen Idles were not considered to be as musically talented as other bands. The band was known for their ability to irritate using their lyrics. The lyrics consisted of no melody and digs at different things; such as, drug culture.

===West Coast tour and Inner Ear===
After a number of concerts in D.C. opening for bands such as the Untouchables, the Idles decided to tour the West Coast in August 1980. Along with roadies Garfield and Sullivan, the band traveled to California. They were immediately hassled by police upon their arrival, and after challenging the police, Nelson was handcuffed for an hour. When the Teen Idles eventually began their tour, they were refused entry at Los Angeles&#x27; Hong Kong Café because of their age. Originally due to open for the Dead Kennedys and the Circle Jerks, they settled for playing the next night, opening for the Mentors and a band called Puke, Spit and Guts in exchange for just $15. The Teen Idles impressed those at the venue; MacKaye later said, &quot;People were freaked out by how fast [we played]&quot;.

Upon returning to D.C., the Teen Idles were asked by Skip Groff, owner of the Washington record store Yesterday and Today, to record some tracks at Inner Ear, a small recording studio in Arlington, Virginia. They were introduced to engineer and owner Don Zientara (the &quot;studio&quot; was a four-track recorder at Zientara&#x27;s house). The Teen Idles played live in the basement while Zientara engineered and Groff produced. Seven tracks were recorded in total. However, the band was undecided about what to do with the tapes and eventually shelved them.

===Breakup and &quot;Minor Disturbance&quot;===
In late 1980, the Teen Idles decided to break up, mostly because Grindle had fallen out with Nelson. Grindle&#x27;s new girlfriend, a born-again Christian, disapproved of the band, causing Grindle to question his role. Tensions between Grindle and Nelson, who was an outspoken atheist, escalated until Grindle decided to quit. Their last show was on November 6, when they opened for SVT at the 9:30 Club. It was a key event for the popularity of all-ages shows—where alcohol was not for sale, and thus no age restriction for admission. Previously, at the Mabuhay Gardens in California, the band was allowed entry to the club only after big &quot;X&quot;s were drawn on their hands—this showed that they were under the legal drinking age. The Idles suggested this to 9:30&#x27;s management, and vowed that if youths were caught drinking, the club could ban them. The management agreed; the Teen Idles&#x27; final show passed without incident.

After a year in existence, the band had earned a total of $600. They now faced two options: divide the money among the members, or press the recordings they had made with Zientara at Inner Ear. Choosing the latter, Nelson, Strejcek and MacKaye formed Dischord Records with Groff&#x27;s help, to release the recordings. The band sent the tapes to a pressing plant in Nashville, Tennessee that specialized in pressing country music records. Initially puzzled by the request to put eight songs on a 7&quot; record, they pressed 1,000 copies. For the cover, the band took apart another 7&quot; record sleeve and used it as a template for their own cover design. They photocopied it on 11&quot; × 17&quot; paper, which the band members cut out with scissors, folded and glued by hand, then into these inserted the records and lyric sheets. Released in December 1980, &quot;Minor Disturbance&quot; was a local success, receiving radio airplay and reviews from fanzines such as &quot;Touch and Go&quot;, which meant that Dischord now had enough money to release records by other bands.

===Later projects===
After the Teen Idles disbanded, Grindle chose not to pursue a career in music. By the time of &quot;Minor Disturbance&quot;″s release, Nelson and MacKaye had already formed Minor Threat. The new band&#x27;s first show was on December 17, 1980. Strejcek became involved in the running of Dischord, until Nelson and MacKaye, disappointed by his lack of effort, &quot;decided to take it back&quot;.

===Legacy===
The Teen Idles appeared on several hardcore punk compilations throughout the 1980s and 1990s, most prominently the influential collection &quot;Flex Your Head&quot;, issued by Dischord in January 1982.

To celebrate the label&#x27;s 100th release, Dischord issued the &quot;Anniversary&quot; EP in 1996, comprising the two demo sessions the band had recorded in February and April 1980.

==Musical style and outlook==
According to journalist Michael Azerrad, the Teen Idles &quot;played proto-hardcore tunes that skewered their social milieu&quot;. MacKaye later explained in the hardcore documentary &quot;Another State of Mind&quot;: &quot;When I became a punk, my main fight was against the people who were around me — friends&quot;. When MacKaye was 13, he moved to Palo Alto, California for nine months. On his return, his friends had begun taking drugs and drinking. He remarked, &quot;I said, &#x27;God, I don&#x27;t want to be like these people, man. I don&#x27;t fit in at all with them.&#x27; So it was an alternative&quot;.

The graphic emblem most associated with the straight edge movement is a black &quot;X&quot;, typically drawn on the wearer&#x27;s hands with a marker. According to MacKaye, &quot;We were in San Francisco, and we played a place called Mabuhay Gardens. They figured out we were underage, and they wouldn&#x27;t let us play. We worked out a deal with their management that we just wanted to play and we weren&#x27;t going to drink, so they got a marker and put a big &#x27;X&#x27; on our hand, So we came back to Washington, D.C., and went to this nightclub, the 9:30, and said &#x27;Hey look, we&#x27;re not going to drink and we will put this &#x27;X&#x27; on our hand. If you see us drinking you can throw us out forever. We are not going to drink, we just came to see the music&#x27;&quot;. The band adopted the marking, and though it was initially meant to signify youth, it became a wider emblem for bands prepared to play to audiences under the legal age to be served alcohol. MacKaye noted that at the time the symbol &quot;wasn&#x27;t supposed to signify straight edge—it was supposed to signify kids. It was about being young punk rockers... it represents youth&quot;.

Most of the band&#x27;s lyrics were written by MacKaye. Like the group&#x27;s appearance, their lyrical subject matter reacted against the then dominant new wave scene, and the perceived complacency that many first-wave punk bands, including the Clash and the Damned, seemed to have fallen into by the early 1980s. In &quot;Fleeting Fury&quot;, Strejcek pleads, &quot;The clothes you wear have lost their sting / So&#x27;s the fury in the songs you sing&quot;. The Teen Idles were strongly influenced by punk bands in Washington and California, such as Bad Brains, Black Flag, and the Germs. These influences were reflected in the Teen Idles&#x27; songs, which consisted mostly of Strejcek shouting over a one-two hardcore beat, with MacKaye and Grindle providing short and speedy riffs, interspersed with quick guitar solos from Grindle.

<text>The Teen Idols were a pop punk band originally from Nashville, Tennessee. They were formed in 1992 by Phillip Hill and originally broke up in 2003. The band reunited in 2008 in Chicago, Illinois, with a retooled lineup before breaking up again in 2010.

==History==
The band was formed in 1992 in Nashville, Tennessee and quickly gained local popularity while playing at venues such as Lucy&#x27;s Record Shop and receiving frequent airplay on Nashville college radio. During the mid-90s, they released several EPs under the local indie label, House O&#x27; Pain. In 1996, the Nashville Music Association nominated the band for their Independent Artist of the Year award. A year later, the Teen Idols released their first full-length album under the indie label Honest Don&#x27;s Records. They released two other albums under the Honest Don&#x27;s label before signing to Fueled by Ramen in early 2003. Around that time, Keith Witt left the band and Kevin Sierzega (formerly of Detroit-based P.T.&#x27;s Revenge) took over the vocals. Shortly thereafter, the band released the album &quot;Nothing to Prove&quot; in July 2003, but broke up during the subsequent tour. During their heyday, the Teen Idols headlined many tours in the U.S. and played support with other notable bands such as NOFX, Anti-Flag, Less Than Jake, and The Queers.

After the breakup of the Teen Idols, Tabor, Yonker, and Witt joined forces with Geis and Gui from Rehasher and have toured and recorded as the band Bullets to Broadway. The band released one album, &quot;Drink Positive&quot;, and supported Lagwagon and Lawrence Arms on US legs as well as Less Than Jake on their 2006 European tour. Yanker went on to play with The Queers, Ben Weasel, The Methadones and would own Drastic Sounds Recording Studio in Nashville. Hill did duties with many bands including The Queers, Screeching Weasel, and Even in Blackouts.

In December 2008, the Teen Idols announced that they had decided to come out of retirement and would soon be making new records and playing shows again. In early 2009, the Teen Idols announced a tentative agreement to sign with Fat Wreck Chords but an official contract never materialized. Later that year, guitar player Phillip Hill was hospitalized with four broken ribs and a collapsed lung after trying to break up a fight. Because he lacked health insurance, an account was set up to help raise money for his medical bills. The band broke up again in June 2010.

Former bassist Roxanne &quot;Rocksan&quot; Biggerstaff, who later worked as a professional wrestling valet in various promotions, especially under the ring name BellaDonna as part of the early 2000s stable The Disciples of the New Church in Impact Wrestling when it was known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), died on January 21, 2019. She was 39.

<doc id="518466" wikidata="Q630808" url="?curid=518466" title="Ten Years After">
<text>Ten Years After are a British blues rock group, most popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Between 1968 and 1973, the band had eight consecutive Top 40 albums on the UK Albums Chart. In addition, they had twelve albums enter the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. They are best known for tracks such as &quot;I&#x27;m Going Home&quot;, &quot;Hear Me Calling&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;d Love to Change the World&quot; and &quot;Love Like a Man&quot;.

==History==
===Formation: 1962–1966===

The band&#x27;s core formed in late 1960 as Ivan Jay and the Jaycats. After several years of local success in the Nottingham/Mansfield area, they changed their name to the Jaybirds in 1962, and later to Ivan Jay and the Jaymen. Ivan Jay sang lead vocals from late 1960 to 1962 and was joined by Ric Lee in August 1965, replacing drummer Dave Quickmire who had replaced Pete Evans in 1962. Roy Cooper played rhythm guitar and sang from 1960 to 1962. The Jaybirds moved to London to back the Ivy League in 1966. In the same year, Chick Churchill joined the group as keyboard player. That November, the quartet signed a manager, Chris Wright, and changed their name to Blues Trip. Using the name Blues Yard they played one show at the Marquee Club supporting the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band. Alvin Lee and Leo Lyons again changed their name in 1966 to Ten Years After – in honour of Elvis Presley, one of Lee&#x27;s idols. (This was ten years after Presley&#x27;s successful year, 1956). Some sources claim that the name was pulled by Leo Lyons from a magazine, advertising a book, &quot;Suez Ten Years After&quot; (referring to the Suez Crisis).

===Ten Years After: 1967–1974===
The group was the first act booked by the soon-to-be Chrysalis Agency. They secured a residency at the Marquee, and were invited to play at the Windsor Jazz Festival in 1967. That performance led to a contract with Deram, a subsidiary of Decca – they were the first band without a hit single that Deram signed. In October 1967 they released the self-titled debut album &quot;Ten Years After&quot;. In 1968, after touring Scandinavia and the United States, they released a second LP, the live album &quot;Undead&quot;, with a first version of the noteworthy song &quot;I&#x27;m Going Home&quot;. They followed this in February 1969 with the studio issue &quot;Stonedhenge&quot;, a British hit that included another well-known track, &quot;Hear Me Calling&quot;, which was released as a single (and was covered by the British glam rock band Slade in 1972). In July 1969, the group appeared at the first instance of the Newport Jazz Festival that rock bands were invited to. On 26 and 27 July 1969, they appeared at the Seattle Pop Festival held at Gold Creek Park. On 17 August, the band performed a breakthrough American appearance at the Woodstock Festival; their rendition of &quot;I&#x27;m Going Home&quot; with Alvin Lee as lead singer/lead guitarist was featured in both the subsequent film and soundtrack album and increased the group&#x27;s popularity. In 1970, Ten Years After released &quot;Love Like a Man&quot;, the group&#x27;s only hit in the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at #10. It was the first record issued with a different playing speed on each side: a three-minute edit at 45 rpm, and a nearly eight-minute live version at 33 rpm. The full studio version song appeared on the band&#x27;s fifth album, their most successful in Britain, &quot;Cricklewood Green&quot;. In August 1970, they played the Strawberry Fields Festival near Toronto, and the Isle of Wight Festival 1970.

In 1971, the band switched labels to Columbia Records (US) and Chrysalis (UK) and released the hit album &quot;A Space in Time,&quot; which marked a move toward more commercial material. It featured the group&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;I&#x27;d Love to Change the World&quot;. In late 1972, the group issued their second Columbia album &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Music to the World&quot; and, in 1973, the live double album &quot;Ten Years After Recorded Live&quot;. The band broke up after their final 1974 Columbia album, &quot;Positive Vibrations&quot;.

===Post-break-up, then reunion===
In the second half of the 1970s and early 1980s, Alvin Lee toured with a new band he called Ten Years Later.

The original Ten Years After reunited in 1983 to play the Reading Festival, and this performance was later released on CD as &quot;The Friday Rock Show Sessions – Live at Reading &#x27;83&quot;.

In 1988, the members reunited for a few concerts and recorded the album &quot;About Time&quot; (1989) with producer Terry Manning in Memphis. They stayed together for their longest continuous period, until 2003, though without releasing new material. In 1994, they participated in the Eurowoodstock festival in Budapest.

In 2003, the other band members replaced Alvin Lee with Joe Gooch, and recorded the album &quot;Now&quot;. Material from the subsequent tour was used for the 2005 double album &quot;Roadworks&quot;. Alvin Lee mostly played and recorded under his own name following his split from the band. He died from complications during a routine medical procedure on 6 March 2013. Ric Lee is currently in a band called Ric Lee&#x27;s Natural Born Swingers, along with Bob Hall. In January 2014, it was announced that Gooch and Lyons had left Ten Years After. Two months later, veteran bass player Colin Hodgkinson and singer/guitarist Marcus Bonfanti were announced as their replacements. In October 2017, the band released its most recent studio album, &quot;A Sting in the Tale&quot;.

In September 2024, it was announced the lineup of Lee, Churchill, Bonfanti, and Hodgkinson had split and Lee intended to premiere a new lineup in early 2025.

<doc id="518484" wikidata="Q438106" url="?curid=518484" title="Sister Rosetta Tharpe">
<text>Sister Rosetta Tharpe (born Rosetta Nubin, March 20, 1915 – October 9, 1973) was an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. She gained popularity in the 1930s and 1940s with her gospel recordings, characterized by a unique mixture of spiritual lyrics and electric guitar. She was the first great recording star of gospel music, and was among the first gospel musicians to appeal to rhythm and blues and rock and roll audiences, later being referred to as &quot;the original soul sister&quot; and &quot;the Godmother of rock and roll&quot;. She influenced early rock-and-roll musicians, including Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and also later guitarists, such as Eric Clapton.

Tharpe was a pioneer in her guitar technique; she was among the first popular recording artists to use heavy distortion on her electric guitar, opening the way to the rise of electric blues. Her guitar-playing technique had a profound influence on the development of British blues in the 1960s. Her European tour with Muddy Waters in 1964, with a stop in Manchester on May 7, is cited by British guitarists such as Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Keith Richards.

Willing to cross the line between sacred and secular by performing her music of &quot;light&quot; in the &quot;darkness&quot; of nightclubs and concert halls with big bands behind her, Tharpe pushed spiritual music into the mainstream and helped pioneer the rise of pop-gospel, beginning in 1938 with the recording &quot;Rock Me&quot; and with her 1939 hit &quot;This Train&quot;. Her unique music left a lasting mark on more conventional gospel artists such as Ira Tucker Sr., of the Dixie Hummingbirds. While controversial among conservative religious groups due to her forays into the pop world, she never left gospel music.

Tharpe&#x27;s 1944 release &quot;Down by the Riverside&quot; was selected for the National Recording Registry of the U.S. Library of Congress in 2004, which noted that it &quot;captures her spirited guitar playing and unique vocal style, demonstrating clearly her influence on early rhythm-and-blues performers&quot; and cited her influence on &quot;many gospel, jazz, and rock artists&quot;. (&quot;Down by the Riverside&quot; was recorded by Tharpe on December 2, 1948, in New York City, and issued as Decca single 48106). Her 1945 hit &quot;Strange Things Happening Every Day&quot;, recorded in late 1944, featured Tharpe&#x27;s vocals and resonator guitar, with Sammy Price (piano), bass and drums. It was the first gospel record to cross over, hitting no. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; &quot;race records&quot; chart, the term then used for what later became the R&amp;B chart, in April 1945. The recording has been cited as a precursor of rock and roll, and alternatively has been called the first rock and roll record. In May 2018, Tharpe was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as an Early Influence.

==Childhood==
Tharpe was born on March 20, 1915, as Rosetta Nubin in Cotton Plant, Arkansas, to Katie Bell Nubin and Willis Atkins, who were cotton pickers. However, researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc give her birth name as Rosether Atkins (or Atkinson), her mother&#x27;s name being Katie Harper. Little is known of her father except that he was a singer. Tharpe&#x27;s mother Katie was also a singer and a mandolin player, deaconess-missionary, and women&#x27;s speaker for the Church of God in Christ (COGIC), which was founded in 1897 by Charles Harrison Mason, a black Pentecostal bishop, who encouraged rhythmic musical expression, dancing in praise and allowing women to sing and teach in church. Encouraged by her mother, Tharpe began singing and playing the guitar as Little Rosetta Nubin at the age of six and was cited as a musical prodigy.

About 1921, at age six, Tharpe had joined her mother as a regular performer in a traveling evangelical troupe. Billed as a &quot;singing and guitar playing miracle&quot;, she accompanied her mother in performances that were part sermon and part gospel concert before audiences across the American South. In the mid-1920s, Tharpe and her mother settled in Chicago, Illinois, where they performed religious concerts at the Roberts Temple COGIC on 40th Street, occasionally traveling to perform at church conventions throughout the country. Tharpe developed considerable fame as a musical prodigy, standing out in an era when prominent black female guitarists were rare.

===Marriage and stage name===
In 1934, at age 19, she married Thomas Thorpe, a COGIC preacher, who accompanied her and her mother on many of their tours. The marriage lasted only a few years, but she decided to adopt a version of her husband&#x27;s surname as her stage name, Sister Rosetta Tharpe. In 1938, she left her husband and moved with her mother to New York City. Although she married several times, she performed as Rosetta Tharpe for the rest of her life.

==Career==
===Early career===
On October 31, 1938, aged 23, Tharpe recorded for the first time – four sides for Decca Records. The first gospel songs recorded by Decca, &quot;Rock Me&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s All&quot;, &quot;My Man and I&quot; and &quot;The Lonesome Road&quot;, were instant hits, establishing Tharpe as an overnight sensation and one of the first commercially successful gospel recording artists. &quot;Rock Me&quot; influenced many rock-and-roll singers, such as Elvis Presley, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis. In 1942, the music critic Maurie Orodenker, describing Tharpe&#x27;s &quot;Rock Me&quot;, wrote &quot;It&#x27;s Sister Rosetta Tharpe for the rock &amp; roll spiritual singing.&quot;

She had signed a ten-year contract with Lucky Millinder. Tharpe officially joined Millinder&#x27;s swing band in 1941 and continued touring with the band throughout the 1940s. Her records caused an immediate furor: many churchgoers were shocked by the mixture of gospel-based lyrics and secular-sounding music, but secular audiences loved them. Tharpe played on several occasions with the white singing group the Jordanaires.

Tharpe&#x27;s appearances with Cab Calloway at Harlem&#x27;s Cotton Club in October 1938 and in John Hammond&#x27;s &quot;Spirituals to Swing&quot; concert at Carnegie Hall on December 23, 1938, gained her more fame, along with notoriety. Performing gospel music for secular nightclub audiences and alongside blues and jazz musicians and dancers was unusual, and in conservative religious circles a woman playing the guitar in such settings was frowned upon. Tharpe fell out of favor with segments of the gospel community.

By 1943 she considered rebuilding a strictly gospel act, but she was contractually required to perform more worldly material. Her nightclub performances, in which she would sometimes sing gospel songs amid scantily clad showgirls, caused her to be shunned by some in the gospel community.

During this time masculinity was directly linked to guitar skills. Tharpe was often offered the intended compliment that she could &quot;play like a man&quot;, demonstrating her skills at guitar battles at the Apollo.

Tharpe continued recording during World War II, one of only two gospel artists able to record V-discs for troops overseas.

Her song &quot;Strange Things Happening Every Day&quot;, recorded in 1944 with Sammy Price, Decca&#x27;s house boogie woogie pianist, showcased her virtuosity as a guitarist and her witty lyrics and delivery. It was the first gospel song to appear on the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine Harlem Hit Parade. This 1944 record has been called the first rock and roll record. Tharpe toured throughout the 1940s, backed by various gospel quartets, including the Dixie Hummingbirds.

In 1946, Tharpe saw Marie Knight perform at a Mahalia Jackson concert in New York. Tharpe recognized a special talent in Knight. Two weeks later, Tharpe showed up at Knight&#x27;s doorstep, inviting her to go on the road. They toured the gospel circuit for a number of years, during which they recorded hits such as &quot;Up Above My Head&quot; and &quot;Gospel Train&quot;.

===Later career===

Starting in 1949, their popularity took a sudden downturn. Mahalia Jackson was starting to eclipse Tharpe in popularity, and Knight harbored a desire to break free as a solo act into popular music. Furthermore, around this time, Knight lost her children and mother in a house fire. That same year, to commemorate Tharpe&#x27;s first anniversary of being a homeowner in Richmond, Virginia, Tharpe put on a concert at what is now the Altria Theater. Supporting her for that concert were the Twilight Singers, whom Rosetta adopted as her background singers for future concerts, renaming them The Rosettes.

Tharpe attracted 25,000 paying customers to her wedding to her manager, Russell Morrison (her third marriage), followed by a vocal performance at Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C., in 1951. In 1952, Tharpe and Red Foley recorded the B-side &quot;Have a Little Talk with Jesus&quot;, which is likely the first interracial duet recorded in the US. It was not until 1968 that Billy Vera and Judy Clay had a hit with an interracial duet, &quot;Storybook Children&quot;.

In 1956, Tharpe recorded an album with the gospel quartet The Harmonizing Four, titled &quot;Gospel Train&quot;. In 1957, Tharpe was booked for a month-long tour of the UK by British trombonist Chris Barber.

=== 1964 European tour ===

In April and May 1964, Tharpe toured Europe as part of the Blues and Gospel Caravan, alongside Muddy Waters and Otis Spann, Ransom Knowling, and Little Willie Smith, Reverend Gary Davis, Cousin Joe, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. Tharpe was introduced on stage and accompanied on piano by Cousin Joe Pleasant. Under the auspices of George Wein, the Caravan was stage-managed by Joe Boyd. A concert, in the rain, was recorded by Granada Television at the disused railway station at Wilbraham Road, Manchester, in May 1964. The band performed on one platform while the audience was seated on the opposite platform.

According to Chris Lee of University of Salford, the 1964 Manchester show &quot;influenced nearly everyone who saw it&quot; and was as important as the Sex Pistols&#x27; 1976 show at the city&#x27;s Lesser Free Trade Hall, which spurred attendees Morrissey, Mark E. Smith, and the musicians who would become Joy Division and Buzzcocks into action.

==Later life and death==

Tharpe&#x27;s biographer said in 2018 that &quot;she influenced Elvis Presley, she influenced Johnny Cash, she influenced Little Richard&quot;. When asked about her music and about rock and roll, Tharpe is reported to have said, &quot;Oh, these kids and rock and roll — this is just sped up rhythm and blues. I&#x27;ve been doing that forever&quot;.

Tharpe&#x27;s performances were curtailed by a stroke in 1970, after which one of her legs was amputated as a result of complications from diabetes. On October 9, 1973, the eve of a scheduled recording session, she died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as a result of another stroke. She was buried at Northwood Cemetery in Philadelphia.

== Musical influence ==
Tharpe&#x27;s guitar style blended melody-driven urban blues with traditional folk arrangements and incorporated a pulsating swing that was a precursor of rock and roll.

A National Public Radio article commented in 2017 that &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll was bred between the church and the nightclubs in the soul of a queer black woman in the 1940s named Sister Rosetta Tharpe&quot;.

Little Richard referred to her as his favorite singer when he was a child. In 1947, she heard Richard sing before her concert at the Macon City Auditorium and later invited him on stage to sing with her; it was Richard&#x27;s first public performance outside of the church. Following the show, she paid him for his performance, which inspired him to become a performer. When Johnny Cash gave his induction speech at the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame, he referred to Tharpe as his favorite singer when he was a child. His daughter Rosanne Cash stated in an interview with Larry King that Tharpe was her father&#x27;s favorite singer. Tharpe began recording with electric guitar in the 1940s, with &quot;That&#x27;s All&quot;, which has been cited as an influence on Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley. Other musicians, including Aretha Franklin, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Isaac Hayes, have identified her singing, guitar playing, and showmanship as an important influence on them. She was held in particularly high esteem by UK jazz/blues singer George Melly. Tina Turner credits Tharpe, along with Mahalia Jackson, as an early musical influence. Such diverse performers as Meat Loaf, Neil Sedaka and Karen Carpenter have attested to the influence of Tharpe in the rhythmic energy she emanated in her performances (Carpenter&#x27;s drum fills are especially reminiscent of Tharpe&#x27;s &quot;Chorlton Chug&quot;).

According to a PBS article, Elvis was influenced by five artists, including Sister Rosetta Tharpe. “She had a major impact ... when you see Elvis Presley singing songs early in his career, I think you [should] imagine, he is channeling Rosetta Tharpe.&quot;

In 2018 singer Frank Turner wrote and performed the song &quot;Sister Rosetta&quot; about her influence and how she deserved to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The single was released on July 3, 2019.

According to Cleveland.com, Tharpe &quot;plugged into an electric guitar in the late 1930s and became a rock star before the men considered the pioneers of rock and roll had dreamt of doing so. She&#x27;s the &quot;Godmother of rock and roll&quot; who influenced every musician traditionally identified with helping launch the genre during the 1950s&quot;.

==Awards and legacy==
A resurgence of interest in Tharpe&#x27;s work led to a biography, several NPR segments, scholarly articles, and honors. A biography entitled &quot;Shout, Sister, Shout!&quot; by Gayle L. Wald was published in 2007. The United States Postal Service issued a 32-cent commemorative stamp to honor Tharpe on July 15, 1998. In 2007, she was inducted posthumously into the Blues Hall of Fame. In 2008, a concert was held to raise funds for a marker for her grave, and January 11 was declared Sister Rosetta Tharpe Day in Pennsylvania. A gravestone was put in place later that year, and a Pennsylvania historical marker was approved for placement at her home in the Yorktown neighborhood of Philadelphia.

In 2011 BBC Four aired a one-hour documentary, &quot;Sister Rosetta Tharpe: The Godmother of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, written and directed by UK filmmaker Mick Csaky. In 2013 the film was shown in the US as part of the PBS series &quot;American Masters&quot;. The film has been aired numerous times in the UK and US, most recently in March 2015 to mark the 100th anniversary of Tharpe&#x27;s birth. On March 20, 2015, the UK newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; published a 100th-birthday tribute by Richard Williams. On September 12, 2016, the musical play &quot;Marie And Rosetta&quot;, based on the relationship between Tharpe and Marie Knight, opened at the Atlantic Theater Company in New York.

On October 5, 2017, Tharpe was listed as a nominee for the 2018 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductions. On December 13, 2017, she was elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as an Early Influence.

In 2017, National Public Radio wrote about the artist&#x27;s career and concluded with these comments: Tharpe &quot;was a gospel singer at heart who became a celebrity by forging a new path musically... Through her unforgettable voice and gospel swing crossover style, Tharpe influenced a generation of musicians including Aretha Franklin, Chuck Berry and countless others... She was, and is, an unmatched artist.&quot;

A musical about her life named &quot;Shout, Sister, Shout!&quot;, based on the Gayle Wald biography of the same name, and written in 2017 by playwright Cheryl West, was performed that year at the Pasadena Playhouse, two years later at Seattle Repertory Theatre, and in 2023 at Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Washington, D.C..

A musical production entitled &quot;Marie &amp; Rosetta&quot;, about Tharpe and her singing partner Marie Knight, will be staged at the Rose Theatre in Kingston upon Thames and the Minerva Theatre in Chichester, with Beverley Knight portraying Tharpe.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Tharpe the 6th greatest guitarist of all time in 2023.

<doc id="518489" wikidata="Q473809" url="?curid=518489" title="Amoebozoa">
<text>Amoebozoa is a major taxonomic group containing about 2,400 described species of amoeboid protists, often possessing blunt, fingerlike, lobose pseudopods and tubular mitochondrial cristae. In traditional classification schemes, Amoebozoa is usually ranked as a phylum within either the kingdom Protista or the kingdom Protozoa. In the classification favored by the International Society of Protistologists, it is retained as an unranked &quot;supergroup&quot; within Eukaryota. Molecular genetic analysis supports Amoebozoa as a monophyletic clade. Modern studies of eukaryotic phylogenetic trees identify it as the sister group to Opisthokonta, another major clade which contains both fungi and animals as well as several other clades comprising some 300 species of unicellular eukaryotes. Amoebozoa and Opisthokonta are sometimes grouped together in a high-level taxon, named Amorphea.
Amoebozoa includes many of the best-known amoeboid organisms, such as &quot;Chaos&quot;, &quot;Entamoeba&quot;, &quot;Pelomyxa&quot; and the genus &quot;Amoeba&quot; itself. Species of Amoebozoa may be either shelled (testate) or naked, and cells may possess flagella. Free-living species are common in both salt and freshwater as well as soil, moss and leaf litter. Some live as parasites or symbionts of other organisms, and some are known to cause disease in humans and other organisms.

While the majority of amoebozoan species are unicellular, the group also includes several clades of slime molds, which have a macroscopic, multicellular stage of life during which individual amoeboid cells remain together after multiple cell division to form a macroscopic plasmodium or, in cellular slime molds, aggregate to form one.

Amoebozoa vary greatly in size. Some are only 10–20 μm in diameter, while others are among the largest protozoa. The well-known species &quot;Amoeba proteus,&quot; which may reach 800 μm in length, is often studied in schools and laboratories as a representative cell or model organism, partly because of its convenient size. Multinucleate amoebae like &quot;Chaos&quot; and &quot;Pelomyxa&quot; may be several millimetres in length, and some multicellular amoebozoa, such as the &quot;dog vomit&quot; slime mold &quot;Fuligo septica&quot;, can cover an area of several square meters.

==Morphology==

Amoebozoa is a large and diverse group, but certain features are common to many of its members. The amoebozoan cell is typically divided into a granular central mass, called endoplasm, and a clear outer layer, called ectoplasm. During locomotion, the endoplasm flows forwards and the ectoplasm runs backwards along the outside of the cell. In motion, many amoebozoans have a clearly defined anterior and posterior and may assume a &quot;monopodial&quot; form, with the entire cell functioning as a single pseudopod. Large pseudopods may produce numerous clear projections called subpseudopodia (or determinate pseudopodia), which are extended to a certain length and then retracted, either for the purpose of locomotion or food intake. A cell may also form multiple indeterminate pseudopodia, through which the entire contents of the cell flow in the direction of locomotion. These are more or less tubular and are mostly filled with granular endoplasm. The cell mass flows into a leading pseudopod, and the others ultimately retract, unless the organism changes direction.

While most amoebozoans are &quot;naked,&quot; like the familiar &quot;Amoeba&quot; and &quot;Chaos&quot;, or covered with a loose coat of minute scales, like Cochliopodium and Korotnevella, members of the order Arcellinida form rigid shells, or tests, equipped with a single aperture through which the pseudopods emerge. Arcellinid tests may be secreted from organic materials, as in &quot;Arcella&quot;, or built up from collected particles cemented together, as in &quot;Difflugia. &quot;

In all amoebozoa, the primary mode of nutrition is phagocytosis, in which the cell surrounds potential food particles with its pseudopods, sealing them into vacuoles within which they may be digested and absorbed. Some amoebozoans have a posterior bulb called a uroid, which may serve to accumulate waste, periodically detaching from the rest of the cell. When food is scarce, most species can form cysts, which may be carried aerially and introduce them to new environments. In slime moulds, these structures are called spores, and form on stalked structures called fruiting bodies or sporangia. Mixotrophic species living in a symbiotic relationship with microalgae of the genus Chlorella, which lives inside the cytoplasm of their host, have been found in Arcellinida and Mayorella.

The majority of Amoebozoa lack flagella and more generally do not form microtubule-supported structures except during mitosis. However, flagella do occur among the Archamoebae, and many slime moulds produce biflagellate gametes . The flagellum is generally anchored by a cone of microtubules, suggesting a close relationship to the opisthokonts. The mitochondria in amoebozoan cells characteristically have branching tubular cristae. However, among the Archamoebae, which are adapted to anoxic or microaerophilic habitats, mitochondria have been lost.

==Classification==
===Place of Amoebozoa in the eukaryote tree===

It appears (based on molecular genetics) that the members of Amoebozoa form a sister group to animals and fungi, diverging from this lineage after it had split from the other groups,
as illustrated below in a simplified diagram:

Strong similarities between Amoebozoa and Opisthokonts lead to the hypothesis that they form a distinct clade. Thomas Cavalier-Smith proposed the name &quot;unikonts&quot; (formally, Unikonta) for this branch, whose members were believed to have been descended from a common ancestor possessing a single emergent flagellum rooted in one basal body.[1][2] However, while the close relationship between Amoebozoa and Opisthokonta is robustly supported, recent work has shown that the hypothesis of a uniciliate ancestor is probably false. In their Revised Classification of Eukaryotes (2012), Adl et al. proposed Amorphea as a more suitable name for a clade of approximately the same composition, a sister group to the Diaphoretickes. More recent work places the members of Amorphea together with the malawimonids and collodictyonids in a proposed clade called Opimoda, which comprises one of two major lineages diverging at the root of the eukaryote tree of life, the other being Diphoda.

===Subphyla within Amoebozoa: Lobosa and Conosa===
Traditionally all amoebozoa with lobose pseudopods were grouped together in the class Lobosea, placed with other amoeboids in the phylum Sarcodina or Rhizopoda, but these were considered to be unnatural groups. Structural and genetic studies identified the percolozoans and several archamoebae as independent groups. In phylogenies based on rRNA their representatives were separate from other amoebae, and appeared to diverge near the base of eukaryotic evolution, as did most slime molds.

However, revised trees by Cavalier-Smith and Chao in 1996 suggested that the remaining lobosans do form a monophyletic group, to which the Archamoebae and Mycetozoa were closely related, although the percolozoans were not. Subsequently, they emended the phylum Amoebozoa to include both the subphylum Lobosa and a new subphylum Conosa, comprising the Archamoebae and the Mycetozoa.

Recent molecular genetic data appear to support this primary division of the Amoebozoa into Lobosa and Conosa. The former, as defined by Cavalier-Smith and his collaborators, consists largely of the classic Lobosea: non-flagellated amoebae with blunt, lobose pseudopods (&quot;Amoeba&quot;, &quot;Acanthamoeba, Arcella, Difflugia etc.&quot;). The latter is made up of both amoeboid and flagellated cells, characteristically with more pointed or slightly branching subpseudopodia (Archamoebae and the Mycetozoan slime molds).

===Phylogeny and taxonomy within Amoebozoa===

From older studies by Cavalier-Smith, Chao &amp; Lewis 2016 and Silar 2016. Also recent phylogeny indicates the Lobosa are paraphyletic: Conosa is sister of the Cutosea.

==Fossil record==
Vase-shaped microfossils (VSMs) discovered around the world show that amoebozoans have existed since the Neoproterozoic Era. The fossil species &quot;Melanocyrillium hexodiadema&quot;, &quot;Palaeoarcella athanata&quot;, and &quot;Hemisphaeriella ornata&quot; come from rocks 750 million years old. All three VSMs share a hemispherical shape, invaginated aperture, and regular indentations, that strongly resemble modern arcellinids, which are shell-bearing amoebozoans belonging to the class Tubulinea. &quot;P. athanata&quot; in particular looks the same as the extant genus &quot;Arcella&quot;.

==List of amoebozoan protozoa pathogenic to humans==
*&quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;
*&quot;Acanthamoeba&quot;
*&quot;Balamuthia mandrillaris&quot;
*&quot;Endolimax&quot;

==Meiosis==

The recently available &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; genome sequence revealed several orthologs of genes employed in meiosis of sexual eukaryotes. These genes included &quot;Spo11, Mre11, Rad50, Rad51, Rad52, Mnd1, Dmc1, Msh&quot; and &quot;Mlh&quot;. This finding suggests that &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; is capable of some form of meiosis and may be able to undergo sexual reproduction.

In sexually reproducing eukaryotes, homologous recombination (HR) ordinarily occurs during meiosis. The meiosis-specific recombinase, Dmc1, is required for efficient meiotic HR, and Dmc1 is expressed in &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;. The purified Dmc1 from &quot;E. histolytica&quot; forms presynaptic filaments and catalyzes ATP-dependent homologous DNA pairing and DNA strand exchange over at least several thousand base pairs. The DNA pairing and strand exchange reactions are enhanced by the eukaryotic meiosis-specific recombination accessory factor (heterodimer) Hop2-Mnd1. These processes are central to meiotic recombination, suggesting that &quot;E. histolytica&quot; undergoes meiosis.

Studies of &quot;Entamoeba invadens&quot; found that, during the conversion from the tetraploid uninucleate trophozoite to the tetranucleate cyst, homologous recombination is enhanced. Expression of genes with functions related to the major steps of meiotic recombination also increased during encystations. These findings in &quot;E. invadens&quot;, combined with evidence from studies of &quot;E. histolytica&quot; indicate the presence of meiosis in the &quot;Entamoeba&quot;. A comparative genetic analysis indicated that meiotic processes are present in all major amoebozoan lineages.

Since &quot;Amoebozoa&quot; diverged early from the eukaryotic family tree, these results also suggest that meiosis was present early in eukaryotic evolution.

==Human health==
Amoebiasis, also known as amebiasis or entamoebiasis, is an infection caused by any of the amoebozoans of the &quot;Entamoeba&quot; group. Symptoms are most common upon infection by &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;. Amoebiasis can present with no, mild, or severe symptoms. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, mild diarrhoea, bloody diarrhea or severe colitis with tissue death and perforation. This last complication may cause peritonitis. People affected may develop anemia due to loss of blood.
Invasion of the intestinal lining causes amoebic bloody diarrhea or amoebic colitis. If the parasite reaches the bloodstream it can spread through the body, most frequently ending up in the liver where it causes amoebic liver abscesses. Liver abscesses can occur without previous diarrhea. Cysts of &quot;Entamoeba&quot; can survive for up to a month in soil or for up to 45 minutes under fingernails. It is important to differentiate between amoebiasis and bacterial colitis. The preferred diagnostic method is through faecal examination under microscope, but requires a skilled microscopist and may not be reliable when excluding infection. This method however may not be able to separate between specific types. Increased white blood cell count is present in severe cases, but not in mild ones. The most accurate test is for antibodies in the blood, but it may remain positive following treatment.
Prevention of amoebiasis is by separating food and water from faeces and by proper sanitation measures. There is no vaccine. There are two treatment options depending on the location of the infection. Amoebiasis in tissues is treated with either metronidazole, tinidazole, nitazoxanide, dehydroemetine or chloroquine, while luminal infection is treated with diloxanide furoate or iodoquinoline. For treatment to be effective against all stages of the amoeba may require a combination of medications. Infections without symptoms do not require treatment but infected individuals can spread the parasite to others and treatment can be considered. Treatment of other &quot;Entamoeba&quot; infections apart from &quot;E. histolytica&quot; is not needed.
Amoebiasis is present all over the world. About 480 million people are infected with what appears to be &quot;E. histolytica&quot; and these result in the death of between 40,000–110,000 people every year. Most infections are now ascribed to &quot;E. dispar&quot;. &quot;E. dispar&quot; is more common in certain areas and symptomatic cases may be fewer than previously reported. The first case of amoebiasis was documented in 1875 and in 1891 the disease was described in detail, resulting in the terms &quot;amoebic dysentery&quot; and &quot;amoebic liver abscess&quot;. Further evidence from the Philippines in 1913 found that upon ingesting cysts of &quot;E. histolytica&quot; volunteers developed the disease. It has been known since 1897 that at least one non-disease-causing species of &quot;Entamoeba&quot; existed (&quot;Entamoeba coli&quot;), but it was first formally recognized by the WHO in 1997 that &quot;E. histolytica&quot; was two species, despite this having first been proposed in 1925. In addition to the now-recognized &quot;E. dispar&quot; evidence shows there are at least two other species of &quot;Entamoeba&quot; that look the same in humans - &quot;E. moshkovskii&quot; and &quot;Entamoeba bangladeshi&quot;. The reason these species haven&#x27;t been differentiated until recently is because of the reliance on appearance.

<text>Pacific Science Center is an independent, nonprofit science center in Seattle with a mission to ignite curiosity and fuel a passion for discovery, experimentation, and critical thinking. Pacific Science Center serves more than 1 million people each year at its campus adjacent to Seattle Center, at the Mercer Slough Environmental Education Center in Bellevue, Washington, and in communities and classrooms across the state of Washington.

==Organization==
Pacific Science Center sits on of land at the southwest corner of Seattle Center. A satellite campus, the Mercer Slough Environmental Education Center, is a collaboration between Pacific Science Center and the City of Bellevue, Washington with educational programming for all ages about environmental stewardship, wetland ecology and nature awareness. Pacific Science Center also offers year-round youth, teen, family and adult programs, including summer camps in various Puget Sound locations, science-themed 21+ events and research weekends.

Pacific Science Center&#x27;s outreach program, Science On Wheels, has a fleet of vans that bring hands-on science education to schools throughout the Pacific Northwest. The center also has a division of staff whose purpose is to assist teachers in teaching science to their students.

==History==

The center&#x27;s original buildings were the United States Science Pavilion designed by Minoru Yamasaki for the 1962 World&#x27;s Fair in Seattle. The World of Science, along with the Worlds of Art, Entertainment, Commerce and Industry, and Tomorrow were the five main theme areas that were installed the World&#x27;s Fair. Located at the southernmost end of the fairgrounds and west of the Space Needle, the World of Science was located next to the arches, an easily-identifiable landmark.

The fountains located at the entrance of the center appeared in the movie &quot;It Happened at the World&#x27;s Fair&quot; with Elvis Presley. After the World&#x27;s Fair closed, the US Science Pavilion was re-opened as Pacific Science Center. The land and buildings were leased for $1.00 a year until 2004, when the title deed was signed over and the Pacific Science Center Foundation officially took ownership.

===1960s===
During the 1960s, many of the center&#x27;s exhibits were carried over from the original World&#x27;s Fair exhibition; only a few of these original exhibits remain today. Currently, exhibits remaining from the World&#x27;s Fair are the Lens and Mirror Machine and a suspended model of the Earth&#x27;s moon. One of the more notable science exhibits during the World&#x27;s Fair was a ramp where the buildings were built at a tilt (the &quot;illusion ramp&quot;); this exhibit was reproduced in the late 1990s. The domed Spacerium, now known as the Seattle Laser Dome and used for laser light show, was designed for a wide-angle movie journey through space. Before IMAX, a previous movie theater there showed films such as NASA&#x27;s Apollo 8 (to the soundtrack of Yellow Submarine) and The 21st Century with Walter Cronkite. Before being elected governor of the state of Washington, Dixy Lee Ray, served as Science Center director for many years. Ray helped promote the Science Center among school children by hosting a school-age geared science program televised on Seattle PBS station KCTS-9.

===1970s===
In the mid-1970s, the lower-level math area was dominated by the &quot;&quot; exhibit, where demonstrators in orange jackets (known as &quot;OJ&quot;s) made soap bubbles and showed audiences how the stylish new Chevrolet Chevette was paving the way for the quick adoption of the Metric system. Upstairs, a giant apparatus known as the &quot;probability machine&quot; would ring an alarm before emptying out a bin of balls. The entire exhibition had been originally designed as an exhibit for the IBM Pavilion at the 1964-65 New York World&#x27;s Fair. It was permanently removed around 1980.

An aerospace building contained a full-sized lunar module mockup from which suited astronauts would climb out. The Life Building contained the Sea Monster House, a replica of a First Nations longhouse, as well as a working hydraulic model of Puget Sound and the Mount Baker volcanic exhibit.

With the physical sciences, the physics witch on Halloween would ask &quot;Would you like to boil &quot;blood&quot; in a paper cup?&quot; or Groucho Marx would dump liquid nitrogen on the ponds after a demo. The presenters in question here were Janie Mann, who did dynamic combustion shows dressed as a witch circa 1977–78, and Dan Cox, who did physics demos as Groucho Marx in the same era. Cox would later go on to become a professor of physics. These staff were part of the &quot;OJ&quot; program (short for &quot;Orange Jacket&quot;, the uniform of the time for Science Center tour guides and visitor assistants). The program consisted of 24 work study students, whose leader in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Carl Linde, set a format for the program that would last into the late 1990s. The Eames theater was originally created for a special multi-screen IBM movie for the World Fair. It was later converted into an IMAX screen in 1979, the first of two IMAX theaters at the center.

===1980s===
Pacific Science Center grew dramatically in the 1980s. A key step in its evolution was the hiring of George Moynihan as executive director in 1980. Moynihan, from the Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley, California, would run the center for the next two decades. His leadership team in the 1980s included Diane Carlson in public programs, Dennis Schatz in education and exhibits, and Dave Taylor in exhibits. In 1984 the science center took a gamble on hosting the exhibit &quot;China: 7000 Years of Discovery&quot;. The success of the exhibit helped put PSC on the map as a leading science center. Other notable successes later in the decade were several iterations of a traveling robotic dinosaur exhibit, which led to the center eventually installing a permanent dinosaur display in the 1990s. Pacific Science Center hosted the annual Association of Science and Technology Centers conference in October 1987 and opened several major exhibits in the same period, including &quot;Kids Works&quot;, &quot;Body Works&quot;, an animal area, and a tide pool.

==Design and architecture==
The Pacific Science Center complex was designed by Minoru Yamasaki; the design brought him international fame, and was featured on the front cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. He later became architect of the World Trade Center in New York City. The walls of each building, composed of many pre-cast concrete slabs, form an arch motif which was used by Yamasaki in a number of his other designs.

In 2013 Pacific Science Center put out a call for public art which would demonstrate the use of solar energy. The resulting installation was designed by Seattle artist Dan Corson and involves five 10 meter (33 ft) tall sculptures of flowers, inspired by the Australian firewheel tree. The work is titled &quot;Sonic Bloom&quot; and generates electricity using solar panels mounted in the flower heads. The flowers hum when people approach them and light up at night.

==IMAX and permanent exhibits==

Today, the Pacific Science Center is composed of eight buildings, including two IMAX theaters (one of only a few places in the world with more than one IMAX theater), one of the world&#x27;s largest Laser Dome theaters, a tropical butterfly house, a planetarium, and hundreds of hands-on science exhibits. In addition to a number of permanent exhibits the center also hosts a variety of traveling and temporary exhibits.

<text>Pierre Marie François de Sales Baillot (; 1 October 1771 – 15 September 1842) was a French violinist and composer born in Passy. He studied the violin under Giovanni Battista Viotti and taught at the Conservatoire de Paris together with Pierre Rode (also a pupil of Viotti) and Rodolphe Kreutzer, who wrote the Conservatoire&#x27;s official violin method (published in the early 19th century). He was sole author of the instructional &quot;L&#x27;Art du violon&quot; (1834). Baillot&#x27;s teachings had a profound influence on technical and musical development in an age in which virtuosity was openly encouraged. He was leader of the Paris Opéra, gave solo recitals and was a notable performer of chamber music.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Pierre Baillot, who was associated with Rode and Kreutzer in the compilation of the celebrated &quot;Methode du Violon&quot;, was born at Passy, near Paris, and became one of the best violinists of his time. His eminence in his profession was not obtained without a long struggle against great difficulties, for at the age of twelve he lost his father, who had kept a school, and became dependent upon friends for his education. His musical talent was remarkable at an early age, and he received his first instruction from an Italian named Polidori. At the age of nine, he was placed under a French teacher named Sainte-Marie, whose training gave him the severe state and methodical qualities by which his playing was distinguished.

At the age of ten, he heard Viotti play one of his concertos, becoming his model. When his father died a year or two later, the intendant of Corsica, M. de Boucheporn, sent him, with his own children, to Rome, where he was placed with Pollani, a pupil of Nardini, under whom he made rapid progress, and soon began to play in public. He was, however, unable to follow directly in the path of his profession, and for five years he travelled with his benefactor, acting as private secretary.

===Career===
In 1791, he returned to Paris, and Viotti secured a place for him in the opera orchestra. But on being offered a position in the Ministère des Finances, he gave up his operatic work, and for some years devoted only his leisure to the study of the violin. He served in the army for twenty months, after which he once more determined to take up music as a profession, soon appearing in public with a concerto by Viotti. This performance established his reputation, and he was offered a professorship of violin playing at the Conservatoire, then recently opened.

His next appointment was to the private band of Napoleon, after which he travelled for three years in Russia with the violoncello player Lemare. Returning to Paris, he established concerts for chamber music, which proved successful, and built up for him a reputation as a quartet player. He frequently performed together with the Polish pianist and composer Maria Agata Szymanowska.

Baillot travelled again, visiting the Netherlands, Belgium, and England, and then he became leader of the opera band in Paris and of the royal band. In March 1825, while serving as concertmaster of the Paris Opéra, Baillot and Luigi Cherubini evaluated Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s application for admission to the Paris Conservatory by playing his Quartet for Piano and Strings in B minor. Mendelssohn was only 16 years old. An anecdote mentioned that, overcome with emotion, Baillot approached the young composer after the performance and, without uttering a word, simply embraced him.

Baillot made a final tour in Switzerland in 1833, and died in Paris in 1842.

==Legacy==
Baillot is considered to have been the last distinguished representative of the great classical school of violin playing in Paris. In his &quot;L&#x27;Art du Violon&quot; he points out the chief distinction between the old and the modern style of violin playing to be the absence of the dramatic element in the former, and its predominance in the latter, thus enabling the executive art to follow the progress marked out by the composer, and to bring out the powerful contrasts and enlarged ideas of more modern musical compositions. After the time of Baillot and his contemporaries, the style of Paganini became predominant in Paris, but the influence of the Paris school extended to Germany, where Spohr must be considered the direct descendant artistically of Viotti and Rode.

<text>Charlie Patton (April 1891 (probable) – April 28, 1934), more often spelled Charley Patton, was an American Delta blues musician and songwriter. Considered by many to be the &quot;Father of the Delta Blues&quot;, he created an enduring body of American music and inspired most Delta blues musicians. The musicologist Robert Palmer considered him one of the most important American musicians of the twentieth century.

Patton (who was well educated by the standards of his time) spelled his name &quot;Charlie&quot;, but many sources, including record labels and his gravestone, use the spelling &quot;Charley&quot;.

==Biography==
Patton was born in Hinds County, Mississippi, near the town of Edwards and lived most of his life in Sunflower County, in the Mississippi Delta. Most sources say he was born in April 1891, but the years 1881, 1885, and 1887 have also been suggested. Patton&#x27;s parentage and race also are uncertain. His parents were Bill and Annie Patton, but locally he was regarded as having been fathered by former slave Henderson Chatmon. Several of Chatmon&#x27;s children became popular Delta musicians, as solo performers and as members of groups including the Mississippi Sheiks. Biographer John Fahey described Patton as having &quot;light skin and Caucasian features.&quot;

Patton was considered African-American, but because of his light complexion there has been much speculation about his ancestry over the years. One theory endorsed by blues musician Howlin&#x27; Wolf was that Patton was Mexican or Cherokee. It is generally agreed that Patton was of Black, White, and Native heritage. Some believe he had a Cherokee grandmother; however, it is also widely asserted by historians that he was between one-quarter and one-half Choctaw. In 1897, his family moved north to the Dockery Plantation, a cotton farm and sawmill near Ruleville, Mississippi. There, Patton developed his musical style, influenced by Henry Sloan, who had a new, unusual style of playing music, which is now considered an early form of the blues. Patton performed at Dockery and nearby plantations and began an association with Willie Brown. Tommy Johnson, Fiddlin&#x27; Joe Martin, Robert Johnson, and Chester Burnett (who later became famous in Chicago as Howlin&#x27; Wolf) also lived and performed in the area. Patton served as a mentor to these younger performers. 

Robert Palmer described Patton as a &quot;jack-of all-trades bluesman&quot;, who played &quot;deep blues, white hillbilly songs, nineteenth-century ballads, and other varieties of black and white country dance music with equal facility&quot;. He was popular across the southern United States and performed annually in Chicago; in 1934, he performed in New York City. Unlike most blues musicians of his time who were often itinerant performers, Patton played scheduled engagements at plantations and taverns. He gained popularity for his showmanship, sometimes playing with his guitar down on his knees, behind his head, or behind his back. 

Patton was a small man, about 5 feet 5 inches tall (1.65m), but his gravelly voice was reputed to have been loud enough to carry 500 yards without amplification; a singing style which particularly influenced Howlin&#x27; Wolf (even though Jimmie Rodgers, the &quot;singing brakeman&quot;, has to be cited there primarily). Patton settled in Holly Ridge, Mississippi, with his common-law wife and recording partner, Bertha Lee, in 1933. His relationship with Bertha Lee was a turbulent one. In early 1934, both of them were incarcerated in a Belzoni, Mississippi jailhouse after a particularly harsh fight. W. R. Calaway from Vocalion Records bailed them out of jail and escorted them to New York City, for what would be Patton&#x27;s final recording sessions (on January 30 and February 1). They later returned to Holly Ridge and Lee was with Patton in his final days.

Patton died on the Heathman-Dedham plantation, near Indianola on April 28, 1934. He is buried in Holly Ridge (both towns are in Sunflower County). His death certificate says that he died of a mitral valve disorder. The death certificate does not mention Bertha Lee; the only informant listed is one Willie Calvin. Patton&#x27;s death was not reported in the newspapers. A memorial headstone was erected on his grave (the location of which was identified by the cemetery caretaker, C. Howard, who claimed to have been present at the burial), paid for by musician John Fogerty through the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund in July 1990. The spelling of Patton&#x27;s name was dictated by Jim O&#x27;Neal, who composed the epitaph.

==Recognitions==
&quot;Screamin&#x27; and Hollerin&#x27; the Blues: The Worlds of Charley Patton&quot;, a boxed set collecting Patton&#x27;s recorded works, was released in 2001. It also features recordings by many of his friends and associates. The set won three Grammy Awards in 2003, for Best Historical Album, Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package, and Best Album Notes. Another collection of Patton recordings, &quot;The Definitive Charley Patton&quot;, was released by Catfish Records in 2001.

Patton&#x27;s song &quot;Pony Blues&quot; (1929) was included by the National Recording Preservation Board in the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2006. The board annually selects recordings that are &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

In 2017, Patton&#x27;s story was told in the award-winning documentary series &quot;American Epic.&quot; The film featured unseen film footage of Patton&#x27;s contemporaries and radically improved restorations of his 1920s and 1930s recordings. Director Bernard MacMahon observed that &quot;we had a strong feeling that the music of Patton and his peers reflected the local geography, and I was struck by the extent to which that belief was already shared by people who were living in the Delta back then, when it was a center of musical innovation. Listening to interviews with H. C. Speir, who owned a furniture store in Jackson, Mississippi in the 1920s and was responsible for virtually all the recordings of early Delta blues, he clearly linked the music to its surroundings.&quot; Patton&#x27;s story was profiled in the accompanying book, &quot;American Epic: The First Time America Heard Itself&quot;.

In May, 2021, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame posthumously inducted Patton into the 2021 class as an Early Influence.

===Historical marker===
The Mississippi Blues Trail placed its first historical marker at the cemetery where Patton&#x27;s grave is in Holly Ridge, Mississippi, in recognition of his legendary status as a bluesman and his importance in the development of the blues in Mississippi. It placed another historic marker at the site where the Peavine Railroad intersects Highway 446 in Boyle, Mississippi, designating it as a second site related to Patton on the Mississippi Blues Trail. The marker commemorates the lyrics of Patton&#x27;s &quot;Peavine Blues&quot;, which refer to the branch of the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad which ran south from Dockery Plantation to Boyle. The marker notes that riding on the railroad was a common theme of blues songs and was seen as a metaphor for travel and escape.

<text>Arundinaria is a genus of bamboo in the grass family the members of which are referred to generally as cane. &quot;Arundinaria&quot; is the only bamboo native to North America, with a native range from Maryland south to Florida and west to the southern Ohio Valley and Texas.
Within this region Arundinaria canes are found from the Coastal Plain to medium elevations in the Appalachian Mountains.

Prior to the European colonization of the Americas, cane was an important resource for Indigenous peoples of the Americas. Early European explorers in the U.S. described vast monotypic stands of &quot;Arundinaria&quot; that were common in river lowlands and covered hundreds of thousands of hectares. In the modern era, Arundinaria canebrakes are small and isolated, but there has been interest in restoring them due to the cultural and ecological importance of the plant. Canebrakes provided land for crops, habitat for wild game, and year-round forage for livestock. The cane itself was used for construction, weapons, jewelry, medicines, fuel, and food. Canebrakes declined significantly after colonization due to clearing, farming and fire suppression.

== Description ==
&quot;Arundinaria&quot; species have running rhizomes and have slender, woody culms that reach heights from . &quot;Arundinaria&quot; produce seeds only rarely and usually reproduce vegetatively, forming large clonal genets. When seed production does occur, the colony usually dies afterwards, possibly because the dense thickets of a mature canebrake would otherwise prevent seedling establishment. Only two flowering events are known for A. appalachiana. A colony of cane will expand rapidly using asexual reproduction following disturbances, particularly fire, which triggers new shoots to immediately sprout from the underground rhizomes after the above-ground part of the plant has burned. These shoots grow quickly, up to 1.5 inches per day. Among the distinctive features of the canes is a fan-like cluster of leaves at the top of new stems called a topknot, so-called because of its resemblance to topknot hairstyles.


== Taxonomy ==
=== Species ===
There are four species of &quot;Arundinaria&quot; accepted by the World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP) as of January 2024, listed below.
=== Taxonomic history ===
The genus &quot;Arundinaria&quot; has a complex taxonomic history spanning over two centuries. The canes of the southeastern U.S. were originally described as two species of reed grasses in the genus &quot;Arundo&quot; by Thomas Walter in 1788. André Michaux, working in 1803 and unaware of Walter&#x27;s work, correctly interpreted the canes as a distinct group and created the genus &quot;Arundinaria&quot; with one species. However, neither of these researchers left enough information to their successors, leading to confusion surrounding the identity of the species they had described. A decade later in 1813, G.H.E. Muhlenberg noticed the affinities between the two previous authors&#x27; work and transferred Walter&#x27;s two species to Michaux&#x27;s new genus, yielding a combinatio nova for each, namely &quot;Arundinaria gigantea&quot; and &quot;Arundinaria tecta&quot; . Muhlenberg considered the genus to consist of these two species in addition to &quot;Arundinaria macrosperma&quot; .

The phenotypic diversity of the American &quot;Arundinaria&quot; bamboos subsequently led to a variety of taxonomic treatments, with some authors arguing that only the North American species should be included, while others included dozens of Asian species otherwise considered members of other genera &quot;(Bashania, Oligostachyum, Sarocalamus, Fargesia, Sasa,&quot; etc.). Even African bamboos were placed in Arundinaria under broad concepts for the group. Some outdated systems during this era assigned &quot;Arundinaria&quot; more than 400 species.

A. S. Hitchcock&#x27;s review of the taxonomic state of the North American bamboos was first published in 1935 as part of the Manual of the Grasses of the United States. He interpreted Michaux&#x27;s &quot;Arundinaria macrosperma&quot; as a synonym of Walter&#x27;s &quot;Arundinaria gigantea&quot; , reducing the genus to two species. By the late 20th century, Floyd Alonzo McClure&#x27;s 1973 survey of &quot;Arundinaria&quot; was also considered authoritative, and included only one species, &quot;Arundinaria gigantea&quot;. Most recently, in 2006 researchers from Iowa State University and the University of North Carolina recognised and described a third species, &quot;Arundinaria appalachiana&quot; . The plants that form this species were previously thought to form part of the natural genetic diversity of &quot;Arundinaria gigantea&quot; , but upon in depth analysis using modern phylogenetic methods based on morphology and amplified fragment length polymorphisms, the researchers determined that the canes form three species.Phylogenetic studies in 2006 using molecular and morphological evidence have suggested that the genus forms three natural species confined to the southeastern United States.

== Systematics ==
Two of the three species currently placed in the genus, &quot;Arundinaria gigantea&quot; and &quot;Arundinaria tecta&quot;, were first described scientifically by Thomas Walter in his 1788 &quot;Flora Caroliniana&quot;. Walter placed them in the grass genus &quot;Arundo&quot;. In 1803, the French botanist André Michaux, unaware of the flora prepared by Walter, also published a description of the canes he encountered. Michaux recognised only one species, but created a new monotypic genus for it: &quot;Arundinaria macrosperma&quot; . The name of the genus he used is derived from the same Latin word used by Walter for the plants he described; namely &quot;arundo&quot;, meaning &quot;reed&quot;.

Despite the work done by Walter and Michaux, subsequent researchers had difficulty interpreting their circumscriptions of species boundaries. Walter designated no type specimens, and his Latin protologues that describe the species are vague, including features that could be any of the three species currently recognized. Michaux did designate a type specimen for the species he described, but it does not include enough of the plant to determine with confidence which species it represents, while his protologues were likewise not detailed enough to avoid ambiguity. In 2009, epitypes, a new form of botanical type allowed by the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature in order to clarify older ambiguous types, were designated for &quot;Arundo gigantea&quot; and &quot;Arundinaria macrosperma&quot; . This allows current and future researchers to know precisely what is being discussed when the scientific names applied to these plants are used.

== Uses ==
Ethnobotanists consider cane to have been extremely important to Native Americans in the Southeastern Woodlands before European colonisation. The river cane basketry art is at minimum 3000 years old, and can arguably be considered The plant was used to make structures, arrow shafts, weapons, torches, fishing equipment, jewelry, baskets, musical instruments, furniture, boats, pipe stems, and medicines. &quot;Arundinaria gigantea&quot;, or river cane, has historically been used to construct Native American flutes, particularly among tribes of the Eastern Woodlands. The Atakapa, Catawba, Muscogee Creek, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Cherokee, and other Southeastern tribes have traditionally used this material for mat and basket weaving, and the Chitimacha and Eastern Band Cherokee still widely weave with rivercane today, though basket makers have started making smaller baskets in order to use less material and preserve the increasingly rare river cane. Bean poles made from dried canes can last for several years if properly stored when not in use.

=== Basketry ===
There are several reasons river cane is favored over all other materials for crafting. It can be split into coarser sections for sturdier baskets, or split very thinly for baskets that are delicate and flexible. The smooth, satiny outer surface of the cane stems forms a natural patina when heat or friction is applied to the outer surface. Cane suitable for basket weaving is straight, with the nodes spaced far apart.

Cane is processed by splitting cut sections from top to bottom into quarters or eighths, and then carefully peeling off the smooth outer layer in a single long piece, scraping off any excess material from the inner surface until the splits are thin and flexible enough to be easily wrapped around the artisan&#x27;s finger. The splits are soaked in water to keep them flexible and woven wet. Undyed cane baskets change from green, to cream, to finally yellow as they age. After this, the color of the cane does not change and a basket that is 100 years old can look the same as one that is 500 years old. Cane splits are dyed a variety of colors including black, brown, red, orange, yellow, or purple and woven into intricate geometric designs. Claude Medford Jr., a Choctaw craftsman, taught the techniques of boiling bloodroot with salt for orange dye, using black walnut for brown and black dye, soaking cane along with curly dock for yellow, and adding mussel shells to cane soaking in curly dock to change the color to red. Plaiting and twilling are the two basic weaving techniques utilized in river cane baskets, and from there many variations exist, including double-woven baskets. Different tribes of Native Americans, and often specific families, had their own unique designs and techniques, which spread around through trade. The Chitimacha and Catawba split the cane into very narrow splits and weave them with the smooth side inward, whereas the Choctaw weave with wider splits and face the smooth side outward. When Native Americans were forced into lands different than their homelands, many techniques became lost, and new techniques had to be found for dyeing and crafting. Other new techniques were adopted to be marketable to European settlers for trading. One example of knowledge that has been lost is the original Choctaw names for patterns used in basketry, which had to be planned using mathematics because they were so sophisticated. Many traditional patterns themselves, however, still survive.

=== Food ===
Food uses include flour, cereal, and even &quot;asparagus&quot; of young shoots; however, caution should be used whenever foraging for cane seeds, as the extremely toxic fungus ergot (&quot;Claviceps&quot; spp.) can colonize its seeds as well as those of the common cereals. Ergot-infected plants will have pink or purplish blotches or growths about the size of a seed or several times larger.

Medicinally, the Choctaw use the roots for their painkilling properties.

== Conservation ==
The organization Revitalization of Traditional Cherokee Artisan Resources, using funding from the Cherokee Preservation Foundation, has helped establish restoration sites for Arundinaria gigantea. In 2022, the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians was awarded a $1.9 million grant by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to manage and restore river cane ecosystems throughout their historic homelands in Oklahoma.

<doc id="518512" wikidata="Q132640" url="?curid=518512" title="Phyllostachys">
<text>Phyllostachys ()
is a genus of Asian bamboo in the grass family. Many of the species are found in central and southern China, with a few species in northern Indochina and in the Himalayas. Some of the species have become naturalized in parts of Asia, South America, Australia, and southern Europe.

The stem or culm has a prominent groove, called a sulcus, that runs along the length of each segment (or internode). Because of this, it is one of the most easily identifiable genera of bamboo. Most of the species spread aggressively by underground rhizomes. Being pioneer plants, phyllostachys species will not spread quickly or achieve mature height without access to direct sunlight throughout most of the day.

Some species of &quot;Phyllostachys&quot; grow to 100 ft (30 m) tall in optimum conditions. Some of the larger species, sometimes known as &quot;timber bamboo&quot;, are used as construction timber and for making furniture. Several species are cultivated as ornamental plants, though they can become invasive and troublesome in gardens, unless artificially restricted or grown in containers.

The name &quot;Phyllostachys&quot; means &quot;leaf spike&quot; and refers to the inflorescences.

==Taxonomy==
;Species
;Formerly included
species now considered better suited to other genera: &quot;Bambusa Chimonobambusa Pseudosasa Semiarundinaria Shibataea&quot; 
==Ecology==
Fungi and pathogens growing specifically on &quot;Phyllostachys&quot; have &quot;phyllostachydis&quot; or &quot;phyllostachydicola&quot; species epithets.

==Regulations==
Connecticut property owners are liable for the cost of removing &quot;Phyllostachys&quot; bamboo that grows onto neighboring property, any resulting damages, and fines of $100 per day for growing this bamboo within 40 ft of any adjoining property or public way.
New York has regulations listing&quot; P. aurea&quot; and &quot;P. aureosulcata&quot; as prohibited invasive species.

<doc id="518513" wikidata="Q965695" url="?curid=518513" title="Thermogenesis">
<text>Thermogenesis is the process of heat production in organisms. It occurs in all warm-blooded animals, and also in a few species of thermogenic plants such as the Eastern skunk cabbage, the Voodoo lily (&quot;Sauromatum venosum&quot;), and the giant water lilies of the genus &quot;Victoria&quot;. The lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe, &quot;Arceuthobium americanum&quot;, disperses its seeds explosively through thermogenesis.

==Types==
Depending on whether or not they are initiated through locomotion and intentional movement of the muscles, thermogenic processes can be classified as one of the following:
* Exercise activity thermogenesis (EAT)
* Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), energy expended for everything that is not sleeping, eating or sports-like exercise.
* Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT)

===Shivering===
One method to raise temperature is through shivering. It produces heat because the conversion of the chemical energy of ATP into kinetic energy causes almost all of the energy to show up as heat. Shivering is the process by which the body temperature of hibernating mammals (such as some bats and ground squirrels) is raised as these animals emerge from hibernation.

=== Non-shivering ===

Non-shivering thermogenesis occurs in brown adipose tissue (brown fat) that is present in almost all eutherians (swine being the only exception currently known). Brown adipose tissue has a unique uncoupling protein (thermogenin, also known as uncoupling protein 1) that allows for the synthesis of ATP to be uncoupled from the production of protons (H+), thus enabling mitochondria to burn fatty acids and oxygen to generate heat. The atomic structure of human uncoupling protein 1 UCP1 has been solved by cryogenic-electron microscopy. The structure has the typical fold of a member of the SLC25 family. UCP1 is locked in a cytoplasmic-open state by guanosine triphosphate in a pH-dependent manner, preventing proton leak.

In this process, substances such as free fatty acids (derived from triacylglycerols) remove purine (ADP, GDP and others) inhibition of thermogenin, which causes an influx of H+ into the matrix of the mitochondrion and bypasses the ATP synthase channel. This uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, and the energy from the proton motive force is dissipated as heat rather than producing ATP from ADP, which would store chemical energy for the body&#x27;s use. Thermogenesis can also be produced by leakage of the sodium-potassium pump and the Ca2+ pump. Thermogenesis is contributed to by futile cycles, such as the simultaneous occurrence of lipogenesis and lipolysis or glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. In a broader context, futile cycles can be influenced by activity/rest cycles such as the Summermatter cycle.

Acetylcholine stimulates muscle to raise metabolic rate.

The low demands of thermogenesis mean that free fatty acids draw, for the most part, on lipolysis as the method of energy production.

A comprehensive list of human and mouse genes regulating cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT) in living animals (&quot;in vivo&quot;) or tissue samples (&quot;ex vivo&quot;) has been assembled and is available in CITGeneDB.

== Evolutionary history ==

=== In avians and eutherians ===
The biological processes which allow for thermogenesis in animals did not evolve from a singular, common ancestor. Rather, avian (birds) and eutherian (placental mammalian) lineages developed the ability to perform thermogenesis independently through separate evolutionary processes. The fact that the same evolutionary character evolved independently in two different lineages after their last known common ancestor means that thermogenic processes are classified as an example of convergent evolution. However, while both clades are capable of performing thermogenesis, the biological processes involved are different. The reason that avians and eutherians both developed the capacity to perform thermogenesis is a subject of ongoing study by evolutionary biologists, and two competing explanations have been proposed to explain why this character appears in both lineages.

One explanation for the convergence is the &quot;aerobic capacity&quot; model. This theory suggests that natural selection favored individuals with higher resting metabolic rates, and that as the metabolic capacity of birds and eutherians increased, they developed the capacity for endothermic thermogenesis. Researchers have linked high levels of oxygen consumption with high resting metabolic rates, suggesting that the two are directly correlated. Rather than animals developing the capacity to maintain high and stable body temperatures only to be able to thermoregulate without the aid of the environment, this theory suggests that thermogenesis is actually a by-product of natural selection for higher aerobic and metabolic capacities. These higher metabolic capacities may initially have evolved for the simple reason that animals capable of metabolizing more oxygen for longer periods of time would have been better suited to, for example, run from predators or gather food. This model explaining the development of thermogenesis is older and more widely accepted among evolutionary biologists who study thermogenesis.

The second explanation is the &quot;parental care&quot; model. This theory proposes that the convergent evolution of thermogenesis in birds and eutherians is based on shared behavioral traits. Specifically, birds and eutherians both provide high levels of parental care to young offspring. This high level of care is theorized to give new born or hatched animals the opportunity to mature more rapidly because they have to expend less energy to satisfy their food, shelter, and temperature needs. The &quot;parental care&quot; model thus proposes that higher aerobic capacity was selected for in parents as a means of meeting the needs of their offspring. While the &quot;parental care&quot; model does differ from the &quot;aerobic capacity&quot; model, it shares some similarities in that both explanations for the rise of thermogenesis rest on natural selection favoring individuals with higher aerobic capacities for one reason or another. The primary difference between the two theories is that the &quot;parental care&quot; model proposes that a specific biological function (childcare) resulted in selective pressure for higher metabolic rates.

Despite both relying on similar explanations for the process by which organisms gained the capacity to perform non-shivering thermogenesis, neither of these explanations has secured a large enough consensus to be considered completely authoritative on convergent evolution of NST in birds and mammals, and scientists continue to conduct studies which support both positions.

=== Non-shivering thermogenesis ===
Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) thermogenesis is one of the two known forms of non-shivering thermogenesis (NST). This type of heat-generation occurs only in eutherians, not in birds or other thermogenic organisms. BAT NST occurs when Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1) performs oxidative phosphorylation in eutherians’ bodies resulting in the generation of heat (Berg et al., 2006, p. 1178). This process generally only begins in eutherians after they have been subjected to low temperatures for an extended period of time, after which the process allows an organism&#x27;s body to maintain a high and stable temperature without a reliance on environmental thermoregulation mechanisms (such as sunlight/shade). Because eutherians are the only clade which store brown adipose tissue, scientists previously thought that UCP1 evolved in conjunction with brown adipose tissue. However, recent studies have shown that UCP1 can also be found in non-eutherians like fish, birds, and reptiles. This discovery means that UCP1 probably existed in a common ancestor before the radiation of the eutherian lineage. Since this evolutionary split, though, UCP1 has evolved independently in eutherians, through a process which scientists believe was not driven by natural selection, but rather by neutral processes like genetic drift.

=== Evolution of Skeletal-Muscle Non-Shivering Thermogenesis ===
The second form of NST occurs in skeletal muscle. While eutherians use both BAT and skeletal muscle NST for thermogenesis, birds only use the latter form. This process has also been shown to occur in rare instances in fish. In skeletal muscle NST, Calcium ions slip across muscle cells to generate heat. Even though BAT NST was originally thought to be the only process by which animals could maintain endothermy, scientists now suspect that skeletal muscle NST was the original form of the process and that BAT NST developed later. Though scientists once also believed that only birds maintained their body temperatures using skeletal muscle NST, research in the late 2010s showed that mammals and other eutherians also use this process when they do not have adequate stores of brown adipose tissue in their bodies.

Skeletal muscle NST might also be used to maintain body temperature in heterothermic mammals during states of torpor or hibernation. Given that early eutherians and the reptiles which later evolved into avian lineages were either heterothermic or ectothermic, both forms of NST are thought not to have developed fully until after the K-pg extinction roughly 66 million years ago. However, some estimates place the evolution of these characters earlier, at roughly 100 mya. It is most likely that the process of evolving the capacity for thermogenesis as it currently exists was a process which began prior to the K-pg extinction and ended well after. The fact that skeletal muscle NST is common among eutherians during periods of torpor and hibernation further supports the theory that this form of thermogenesis is older than BAT NST. This is because early eutherians would not have had the capacity for non-shivering thermogenesis as it currently exists, so they more frequently used torpor and hibernation as means of thermal regulation, relying on systems which, in theory, predate BAT NST. However, there remains no consensus among evolutionary biologists on the order in which the two processes evolved, nor an exact timeframe for their evolution.

==Regulation==
Non-shivering thermogenesis is regulated mainly by thyroid hormone and the sympathetic nervous system. Some hormones, such as norepinephrine and leptin, may stimulate thermogenesis by activating the sympathetic nervous system. Rising insulin levels after eating may be responsible for diet-induced thermogenesis (thermic effect of food).
Progesterone also increases body temperature.

==Thermogenesis from white adipose tissue==

A novel and interesting method named the thermogenin-like system (TLS) has recently been proposed to produce thermogenesis from white adipose tissue or from other substantial tissues (such as endothelial or muscle cells). Ultimately, this could lead to new therapeutic methods for treating morbid obesity or severe diabetes. The proposed model is purely theoretical and relies on the use of light-activated PoXeR pumps integrated into the inner membrane of mitochondria. These pumps allow the passage of protons in such a way that the proton motive force is reduced. This would enable greater consumption of blood glucose from white adipose, endothelial, or muscle cells, thereby potentially lowering blood glucose levels. The explanation is that glycolysis is accelerated when glucose enters the cells and undergoes the Krebs cycle in the mitochondria. Since muscle cells have many mitochondria, it is also interesting to express PoXeR pumps in this tissue.

However, the method is invasive, relies on gene therapy, and requires several clinical trials as well as hospitalization to integrate the system at the level of white or muscle adipose tissue in the abdominal fat. It is also a light-responsive system. Since light does not penetrate the skin from the outside, the system must include an under-skin component with alternating activation of green light for a certain duration, followed by deactivation for another period. This cycle repeats over several weeks, particularly to recharge the light system. To ensure that ATP levels do not drop too low (otherwise the cell dies), the system self-regulates. Indeed, for light to be activated in the system, it is necessary to have a mechanism that continuously provides light without significantly lowering ATP levels. As luciferase can emit light in exchange for ATP, if ATP levels decrease too drastically, the light stops, ATP levels rise again, and the light is reactivated to induce thermogenesis.

<text>Pleioblastus is an East Asian genus of monopodial bamboos in the grass family Poaceae. They are native to China and Japan, and naturalized in scattered places in Korea, Europe, New Zealand, and the Western Hemisphere.

The plant spreads by vigorous underground rhizomes which run along just beneath the soil surface, producing plantlets at the nodes. These can be used to propagate new plants, but if not removed they can become invasive.

The species &quot;Pleioblastus variegatus&quot; (green and cream stripes), and &quot;P. viridistriatus&quot; (green and yellow stripes) have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. 

Genetic research suggests that this genus may properly be part of the genus &quot;Arundinaria&quot;.

<doc id="518515" wikidata="Q7314078" url="?curid=518515" title="Replicator (band)">
<text>Replicator was an American noise rock band from Oakland, California. The band consisted of Conan Neutron (electric guitar/vocals/tape deck operation), Ben Adrian (bass guitar/vocals/keyboard), and Chris Bolig (drums). The band was joined by Todd Grant on rhythm guitar for live performances in later years.

The band members were advocates of the DIY punk ethic, as popularized by bands such as Fugazi and The Minutemen. Replicator started as a bay area Indie rock band of little distinction before finding their signature sound, often compared to bands such as Shellac, The Jesus Lizard, Steel Pole Bathtub, and the Melvins. The band had multiple songs influenced by literary works, including those of Kurt Vonnegut, Stephen King, Philip K. Dick and Neal Stephenson. Largely ignored by both the mainstream and underground music world, their irreverent attitude, and &quot;cleverness&quot; won them over a very small but dedicated fanbase, including a handful of famous fans, including comedian Patton Oswalt and comic book author Warren Ellis.

==Music==

Replicator had a sound based on unusual and urgent time signatures, dissonance, repetitive heavy rhythms, an often angular guitar sound, and Neutron and Adrian&#x27;s urgent, sometimes dueling vocals. The songs did not have traditional verse/chorus/verse structure and the arrangements were, at times sparse and at other times chaotic. Replicator&#x27;s sound was often associated with science fiction, paranoia, and somewhat obscure pop culture references, the band frequently cited the fact that they did not have any love songs in their press materials.

Straddling the fine line between &quot;social commentary and smart ass revelry&quot; as well as &quot;technical precision and reckless abandon,&quot; Replicator used analog tape deck to play samples live until switching to a laptop computer with the Bludgeonsoft software Back to Basics for sampling. Song titles such as: &quot;Bawkbakwak Bawkbagone&quot;, &quot;Warrior Needs Food, Badly&quot;, &quot;Frank Lloyd Wrong&quot; and &quot;Login with my fist&quot;, rarely conformed to standard structure, however according to band members in multiple interviews, the song titles almost always are inspired by or inspire the lyrical content of the songs, unlike other bands with lengthy song titling such as Don Caballero (who do not have vocals) and Minus the Bear.

The band recorded their first record &quot;Winterval&quot; with Bob Weston of the band Shellac, triggering understandable comparisons to that band. Shortly afterwards, bass player Dan Kennedy left the band. The lineup solidified in 2001 when Indiana expatriate Ben Adrian joined the band on bass guitar. Adrian often joked that he was still &quot;filling in&quot; on bass 6 years later. 2002 and 2003 saw the band tinker with sound effects, taking the sampling (or &quot;grand theft audio&quot; as Neutron put it) practices of Steel Pole Bathtub and adding this to their developing aggressive and chaotic sound, as well as keyboard. &quot;While Replicator admittedly wears its influences — harsh-but-concise rockers Shellac, progressive punk trio Unwound, and noise pioneers Sonic Youth — on its sleeve, the band&#x27;s music is more than just a cheap knockoff.&quot;

This sound was represented in the album &quot;You Are Under Surveillance&quot;. Frequently cited as chaotic, dense and paranoid, Surveillance was apparently a loose concept album based upon the ideas of &quot;paranoia, lost freedom of choice, airborne revenge, the end of the world, the problems and consequences of an overgrown consumerist, bottom line-oriented culture; and the merits of applied righteous indignation&quot;.

In September 2004, on one of their &quot;ReplicaTours&quot;, Replicator&#x27;s van was broken into and their guitars and keyboards were stolen. Luckily they were able to borrow the equipment of their tourmates Greenlight the Bombers and continue. This theft occurred during the 2004 rash of equipment thefts that plagued many working musicians.

The end of the Arctic Monkeys 2006 song &quot;Perhaps Vampires Is A Bit Strong But&quot;, bears a resemblance to Replicator&#x27;s 2001 song &quot;Ka-Tet&quot;. A song of little distinction or notoriety, but was released 5 years earlier. Some fans of the band have questioned if it is a case of simultaneous inspiration, or a case of (likely) musical plagiarism.

2007&#x27;s &quot;Machines Will Always Let You Down&quot;, seems to also be a loosely based concept album, this time around the conflict between man and machine. The press materials state that it is: &quot;10 songs about Nanotechnological assassination, time travel, building sex robots, the eternal battle of man vs. machine and other things&quot;.

This record was recorded by Vern Rumsey of the band Unwound, and was released on Olympia&#x27;s Radio Is Down record label.

2008 also saw several more US Tours, including a full us tour documented in a tour journal on the music website superstarcastic.com. These shows were largely well received, with the band&#x27;s energy and &quot;gleefully chaotic&quot; sound often cited in reviews 

On January 2, 2008, an announcement was made on the Replicator website that &quot;After 8 years, 3 albums, 2 eps, 4 vans, almost 200 shows, a handful of compilation appearances, and countless floors&quot; the band had agreed to an amicable mutual break up with plenty of warning. After recording a final ep, (Including a cover of Babyland&#x27;s Arthur Jermyn), released again on Radio Is Down, Replicator played their last show at The Hemlock Tavern in San Francisco on April 5.

In 2013, the French webzine gave an exhausting and detailed review to the Replicator discography &quot;Replicator is not content to be maniacs of an impeccable and indestructible rhythm, to ping the air like neurasthenic robots. They also offer a more natural mess, a propensity to confuse the tracks, a complexity of which one wonders where they will end up landing, while offering unsuspected melodies.&quot;&quot;Replicator keeps the optics of an aggressive sound in songs where fun is not absent &quot;

The band convened for a &quot;one off reunion&quot; in May 2015 for the PRF BBQ West Coast, with no plans for future reunions. In an interview with Shiny Grey Monotone, Neutron said: &quot;I loved that band and loved my time in it. We did everything exactly the way we wanted to do it and did a bunch of weird stuff that some people seemed to enjoy. It was completely on our terms and ended when it should have, cool. It meant something to some people, and I&#x27;m pretty sure we left the world a wee but better than how it was when that band came into being, or at least more confused.&quot;

== Post-Replicator activities ==
After the break-up former members of Replicator started two new bands with Ben Adrian forming a post-punk/shoegazing group called Guitar vs. Gravity while Conan Neutron and Chris Bolig formed the short lived classic rock meets noise rock band Mount Vicious. After the break-up of Mount Vicious, Chris Bolig began playing drums for Adrian&#x27;s &quot;small format rock band&quot; Cartographer and Neutron started the band Victory and Associates (2009-2014).

In 2015 Neutron began Conan Neutron &amp; the Secret Friends with Melvins drummer Dale Crover, Tony Ash and producer Toshi Kasai.
In 2020, it was revealed he was also part of the band Household Gods with David Pajo of Slint and Vern Rumsey of Unwound.

Neutron runs the podcast Conan Neutron&#x27;s Protonic Reversal, which is considered one of the definitive information sources for artists in the noise-rock, post-punk and &quot;weird music&quot; genres.

Adrian works at Line 6 and is a key player behind their Helix unit amongst other offerings and is considered a leading voice in the field of sound design.

<doc id="518516" wikidata="Q2465530" url="?curid=518516" title="Orlando Innamorato">
<text>Orlando Innamorato (; known in English as &quot;Orlando in Love&quot;; in Italian titled &quot;Orlando innamorato&quot; as the &quot;I&quot; is never capitalized) is an epic poem written by the Italian Renaissance author Matteo Maria Boiardo. The poem is a romance concerning the heroic knight Orlando (Roland). It was published between 1483 (first two books) and 1495 (third book published separately, first complete edition).

==Composition and publication==
To material largely quarried from the Carolingian and Arthurian cycles, Boiardo added a superstructure of his own making. As the plot is not woven around a single pivotal action, the inextricable maze of most cunningly contrived episodes are seen to be linked, first, with the quest of beautiful Angelica by love-smitten Orlando and the other enamored knights, then with the defense of Albracca by Angelica&#x27;s father, the King of Cathay, against the beleaguering Tartars, and, finally, with the Moors&#x27; siege of Paris and their struggle with Charlemagne&#x27;s army.

The poem, written in the &quot;ottava rima&quot; stanza rhythm, consists of 68 cantos and a half. Boiardo began the poem when he was about 38 years old, but interrupted it for a time because of the Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–1479). He is believed to have continued till 1486, but then left the poem unfinished. The last verses say:

meaning While I sing, Redemptor God, I see Italy covered in flame and fire.The first two books were published sometime between 1482 and 1483, most likely by Pietro Giovanni di San Lorenzo in Reggio; but all copies were lost. It most likely bore the title &quot;L&#x27;innamoramento de Orlando&quot;. The third book first appeared in 1495 (Venice: Simone Bevilacqua) under the title &quot;El fin del inamoramento de&#x27; Orlando&quot;. The first complete edition was published later in 1495 (Scandiano: Camillo Boiardo). Like the &quot;editio princeps&quot; (first two books), the first complete edition of 1495 has been completely lost. The oldest copy which came down to us is the 1487 reedition of the first two books (Venice: Pietro de&#x27; Piasi); only one copy exists, kept at the Biblioteca Marciana. There is also only one extant copy of the 1495 Venetian edition of the third book, located in Monaco. The oldest complete edition we have is dated 1506 (Venice: Giorgio de&#x27; Rusconi); there also remains only one copy, kept at the Marciana.

==Plot==

The beautiful Angelica, daughter of the king of Cataio (Cathay), comes to Charlemagne&#x27;s court for a tournament in which both Christians and Pagans can participate. She offers herself as a prize to whoever will defeat her brother, Argalia, who in the consequent fighting competition imprisons one of the Christians. But the second knight to fight, Ferraguto (a.k.a. Ferraù), kills Argalia and Angelica flees, chased by leading paladins, especially Orlando and Rinaldo. Stopping in the Ardenne forest, she drinks at the Stream of Love (making her fall in love with Rinaldo), while Rinaldo drinks at the fount of hate (making him conceive a passionate hatred of Angelica). She asks the magician Malagigi to kidnap Rinaldo, and the magician brings him to an enchanted island, while she returns to Cataio where she is besieged by King Agrican, another of her admirers, in the fortress of Albraccà. Orlando comes to kill Agrican and to free her, and he succeeds. Afterwards, Rinaldo, who has escaped from the enchanted island, tries to convince him to return to France to fight alongside Charlemagne: consequently, Orlando and Rinaldo duel furiously.

In the meantime the Saracen king Agramante has invaded France with a massive army (along with Rodomonte, Ferraù, Gradasso, and many others), to avenge his father Troiano, previously killed by Orlando. Rinaldo rushes back to France, chased by Angelica in love with him, in turn chased by Orlando. Back in the Ardenne forest, this time Rinaldo and Angelica drink at the opposite founts. Orlando and Rinaldo duel again for Angelica, and Charlemagne decides to entrust her to the old and wise duke Namo, offering her to the one who will fight most valorously against the infidels. In the meantime, the Saracen paladin Ruggiero and Rinaldo&#x27;s sister, Bradamante, fall in love. The poem stops there abruptly, with Boiardo&#x27;s narrator explaining that he can write no more because Italy has been invaded by French troops headed by king Charles VIII.

==Influence==
In spite of its unfinished state and some deficiencies in rhythm, Boiardo&#x27;s &quot;Orlando&quot; is considered a notable work of art. The story of Angelica&#x27;s struggles and Orlando&#x27;s pursuit were continued in &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; by Ludovico Ariosto in 1516. The immediate success of the new poem easily surpassed the fame of &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot;. Furthermore, in 1531 a minor Tuscan poet, Francesco Berni, re-wrote the poem in an elegant and regular Italian, since in the sixteenth century the vernacular traces found in Boiardo&#x27;s work were no longer accepted. The original text, no longer read or published, was newly discovered by Antonio Panizzi in the British Museum Library (1830).

Another Renaissance poet, Torquato Tasso, borrowed many of Boiardo&#x27;s epic conventions, although his &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot; does not use the Orlando frame.

An unabridged English translation was performed by Charles Stanley Ross, published in 2004 by Parlor Press.

<doc id="518517" wikidata="Q738414" url="?curid=518517" title="Chusquea">
<text>Chusquea is a genus of evergreen bamboos in the grass family. Most of them are native to mountain habitats in Latin America, from Mexico to southern Chile and Argentina.

They are sometimes referred to as South American mountain bamboos. Unlike most other grasses, the stems of these species are solid, not hollow. Some animals are, to various extents, associated with stands of &quot;Chusquea&quot;, for example the Inca wren, monito del monte, and the plushcap.

==Notable species==
&quot;Chusquea culeou&quot;, the Chilean feather bamboo or colihue cane, from southern Chile and adjacent western Argentina, is notable as the most frost-tolerant South American bamboo and the only one that has been grown successfully to any extent in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with successful growth as an ornamental plant north to Scotland. The colihue cane was used by the Mapuches Indians to make instruments and as lances during the War of Arauco.

&quot;Chusquea quila&quot; (in Spanish &quot;quila&quot;), in contrast to Colihue, has a spreading or vining growth. It prefers wet places and does not grow above , where &quot;C. culeou&quot; becomes more dominant. &quot;Chusquea quila&quot; can form pure stands called &quot;quilantales&quot;. Very few plants can grow under this species.

In Chile, &quot;Chusquea&quot; species have been historically harvested for seed by indigenous peoples, but the flowering and seeds of the species, is associated to mice vermin.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Chusquea&quot; now includes species formerly classified in &quot;Dendragrostis&quot;, &quot;Rettbergia,&quot; &quot;Swallenochloa&quot;, and &quot;Neurolepis.&quot; The genus has been organized into three subgenera, subg. &quot;Rettbergia&quot;, subg. &quot;Swallenochloa&quot; and subg. &quot;Chusquea&quot;, although molecular evidence only supports a monophyletic subg. &quot;Rettbergia&quot;.
