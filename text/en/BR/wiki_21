<doc id="514691" wikidata="Q3580044" url="?curid=514691" title="Édouard Thomas Burgues de Missiessy">
<text>Édouard-Thomas de Burgues, comte de Missiessy (; 23 April 1756 – 24 March 1837) was a French Navy officer. He joined the navy in April 1766, as a volunteer aboard his father&#x27;s ship and spent most of his early service in the Mediterranean, in the frigates of the Toulon Fleet. When France entered the American Revolutionary War, Missiessy joined the 64-gun Vaillant in Admiral d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s fleet, where he took part in the initial engagements off Newport, St Lucia and Grenada, and in September 1779, the failed attack on Savannah. Missiessy&#x27;s first command came in 1782 when he was promoted to &quot;lieutenant de vaisseau&quot; of the cutter &quot;Le Pygmée&quot;. He was soon after captured by the British but later released in an exchange of prisoners.

In 1789, the year of the outbreak of the French Revolution, Missiessy was a frigate commander in the Mediterranean. Promoted to capitaine de vaisseau in January 1792, he received the command of the ship &quot;Centaure&quot; in Admiral Truguet&#x27;s squadron. In January 1793, he was promoted to &quot;contre-amiral&quot;. The Revolution became more radical and Missiessy was arrested on 21 May 1793 for being of noble birth. He was released and returned to duty on 30 June but when Toulon declared for the King, Missiessy fled to Italy. He did not return to France until 1795 and despite being acquitted by a court of enquiry, he was not given a ship and spent the next six years working ashore.

In 1804, Missiessy was appointed commander-in-chief of the Rochefort squadron with a key role in Napoleon&#x27;s planned invasion of the United Kingdom. The Rochefort squadron was intended to rendezvous with Villeneuve&#x27;s fleet in the West Indies and draw British ships there, before racing back across the Atlantic and seizing control of the English Channel. The failure of this plan was blamed in part on Missiessy and he was dismissed from the service. He was not employed again until February 1808 when he was made Commander-in-Chief of the defences at the Scheldt, foiling the British attacks on Antwerp that occurred between July and September 1809. Missiessy ceased active service on 17 September 1824 and was officially acknowledged as retired on 23 April 1832, when his name was entered on the retirement list. He died at Toulon on 24 March 1837, aged 80.

==Early life and career==
Édouard-Thomas de Burgues, comte de Missiessy was born on 23 April 1756, in Forcalquier, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. He joined the navy in April 1766, at the age of 10, as a volunteer aboard his father&#x27;s ship, &quot;Altier&quot;.
Most of his early service was spent in the Mediterranean, aboard the frigates of the Toulon Fleet. In April 1773, while a &quot;Garcon-Major&quot; on the &quot;Engageante&quot;, he embarked on a lengthy cruise to the Levant which lasted until January 1774. Another 9 month trip to the Levant took place between May 1774 and February 1775. Missiessy undertook a third cruise to the Levant between October 1775 and September 1776, this time as a &quot;Garde du Pavillon&quot; aboard the frigate &quot;Flore&quot;. Missiessy was promoted to &quot;enseigne de vaisseau&quot; in April 1777 and joined &quot;Sultane&quot; for an expedition to the Barbary Coast, where he helped prevent attacks on French shipping by corsairs.

During the American War of Independence, he served Admiral d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s fleet. Aboard the 64-gun Vaillant, Missiessy participated in initial engagements off Newport, St Lucia and Grenada, and in September 1779 took part in the failed attack on Savannah. In December, Missiessy sailed for Lorient but by February the following year, he was on his way back to America in the 32-gun frigate, Surveillante.

==Command==
Missiessy was promoted to &quot;lieutenant de vaisseau&quot; on 9 May 1781 and returned to France in December 1781. He received his first command in March 1782, the cutter &quot;Le Pygmée&quot;, stationed at Brest but was shortly after captured by the British on 27 July 1782. Briefly confined at Deal, Kent, he was exchanged and by September, was serving as second officer aboard the 64-gun &quot;Reflechi&quot;. In early February 1783, he joined the 74-gun &quot;Censeur&quot;, returning home in April. From May 1786, Missiessy commanded transport ships operating in the Baltic.

===Imprisonment and exile===

The French Revolution broke out in May 1789 and Missiessy spent August through to January 1792 in the Mediterranean, where he commanded the frigates &quot;Belette&quot; and &quot;Modeste&quot;. Promoted to capitaine de vaisseau in January 1791, he received the command of the ship &quot;Centaure&quot; in Admiral Truguet&#x27;s squadron. In January 1793, he was promoted to &quot;contre-amiral&quot;. However, the Revolution was becoming more radical and Missiessy was suspected of noble birth and opposing the new regime. He was sent ashore and arrested on 21 May 1793 but was released and returned to duty on 30 June.

When Toulon revolted, declaring for King Louis XVII and inviting the British in, Missiessy abandoned his command and fled to Italy. He returned to France in May 1795, where he faced a court of enquiry. On 25 August, Missiessy was acquitted and released. He was not given another ship however and instead served at the department of Charts and Maps, in Paris, until 1796, then as Director of the School of Naval Construction for four years after.

In June 1801, Missiessy&#x27;s old commander, Truget, requested him as his Chief of Staff for the combined French and Spanish fleet stationed at Cadiz but when peace was declared in March 1802, he was ordered back to Paris and made Maritime Prefect. This was one of the first appointments of its kind, with responsibility for port facilities and fleet services. It was soon after decided to create similar positions for all French naval bases and in July, Missiessy took the job at the port of Le Havre.

===West Indies===

Truget called upon Missiessy again in October 1801, when he needed someone to command a squadron of ships at Brest. Missiessy held the post until 10 September 1804, when he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Rochefort squadron. The Rochefort squadron was a key element in Napoleon&#x27;s planned invasion of the United Kingdom; intended to rendezvous with Villeneuve&#x27;s fleet in the West Indies and draw British ships there, before racing back across the Atlantic and seizing control of the English Channel. On 11 January 1805 the blockading British ships were blown off station, allowing Missiessy&#x27;s force to escape. Aboard the five ships-of-the-line, three frigates and two corvettes were 3500 troops under General Joseph Lagrange and artillery, supplies and weapons to reinforce the French garrisons of Martinique and Guadeloupe. The same wind that disrupted the British blockade, kept the French ships pinned to the coast for five days, delaying arrival in Martinique until 20 February.

The approach to Martinique was guarded by a British battery mounted on Diamond Rock, forcing visiting ships to make a long detour through unfavourable open sea with strong winds and currents. HMS &quot;Diamond Rock&quot;, as it had been impudently named by those occupying it, was a constant irritation to Napoleon and Missiessy was keen to expel the British from it. He could not, however, convince either Lagrange or the Captain-General of Martinique, Villaret-Joyeuse, of the merits of his proposal. It was agreed instead to attack the British held island of Dominica. The assault began on 22 February but the small British contingent, outnumbered three to one, fought fiercely and when the French failed to capture Prince Rupert Fort, they left on 25 February, destroying and burning as much as they could on the way.

On 28 February, Missiesy transported reinforcements and supplies to Guadeloupe. Between 5 and 10 March Missiessy&#x27;s force attacked the British colonies of St Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat, collecting £25,000 in ransom money in the process. Returning to Martinique, Missiessy discovered that he and his squadron had been ordered home and that Napoleon&#x27;s invasion plan had been postponed. Missiessy dropped the remaining troops at Saint-Dominique and set sail for France, arriving in Rochefort on 20 May. Despite carrying out his orders in full, Missiessy was made a scapegoat for Pierre-Charles Villeneuve&#x27;s failings and lambasted by Napoleon for not recapturing Diamond Rock. He was dismissed and command of the Rochefort squadron passed to his second-in-command, Zacharie Allemand.

==Later career==

In February 1808, having been unemployed since his return from the West Indies, Missiessy was given command of the Scheldt squadron and successfully defended Antwerp from the British attacks that occurred between July and September 1809, part of the ill-fated Walcheren Campaign. Having already been promoted Vice-Admiral on 9 March, he was rewarded for his efforts with appointment to Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Coasts and made a Count of the Empire on 23 February 1811, the latter position coming with an annuity of 20,000 francs.

In August 1814, the restored French king, Louis XVIII awarded Missiessy the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour. During the Hundred Days uprising, Missiessy avoided taking sides and was further rewarded following the Bourbon restoration in June 1815: He was Maritime Prefect of Toulon and was elevated to Commander-in-Chief there in January 1816, later serving on the Council of the Admiralty, and finally Commander-in-Chief of the navy.

Missiessy ceased active service on 17 September 1824. In June 1827, he was made a Knight Commander of the Holy Spirit and was officially acknowledged as retired on 23 April 1832, when his name was entered on the retirement list. He died at Toulon on 24 March 1837, aged 80.

<text>Richard Hofstadter (August 6, 1916October 24, 1970) was an American historian and public intellectual of the mid-20th century. Hofstadter was the DeWitt Clinton Professor of American History at Columbia University. Rejecting his earlier historical materialist approach to history, in the 1950s he came closer to the concept of &quot;consensus history&quot;, and was epitomized by some of his admirers as the &quot;iconic historian of postwar liberal consensus.&quot; Others see in his work an early critique of the one-dimensional society, as Hofstadter was equally critical of socialist and capitalist models of society, and bemoaned the &quot;consensus&quot; within the society as &quot;bounded by the horizons of property and entrepreneurship&quot;, criticizing the &quot;hegemonic liberal capitalist culture running throughout the course of American history&quot;.

His most widely read works are &quot;Social Darwinism in American Thought, 1860–1915&quot; (1944); &quot;The American Political Tradition&quot; (1948); &quot;The Age of Reform&quot; (1955); &quot;Anti-intellectualism in American Life&quot; (1963); and the essays collected in &quot;The Paranoid Style in American Politics&quot; (1964). He was twice awarded the Pulitzer Prize: in 1956 for &quot;The Age of Reform&quot;, an analysis of the populism movement in the 1890s and the progressive movement of the early 20th century; and in 1964 for the cultural history &quot;Anti-intellectualism in American Life&quot;. He was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

Hofstadter was born in Buffalo, New York, in 1916 to a Jewish father, Emil A. Hofstadter, and a German-American Lutheran mother, Katherine (née Hill), who died when Richard was ten. He attended Fosdick-Masten Park High School in Buffalo. Hofstadter then studied philosophy and history at the University at Buffalo, from 1933, under the diplomatic historian Julius W. Pratt. Despite opposition from both families, he married Felice Swados (whose brother was Harvey Swados) in 1936 after he and Felice spent several summers at Hunter Colony, New York, run by Margaret Lefranc, their close friend for years; they had one child, Dan.

Hofstadter was raised as an Episcopalian but later identified more with his Jewish roots. Antisemitism may have cost him fellowships at Columbia and attractive professorships. The Buffalo Jewish Hall of Fame lists him as one of the &quot;Jewish Buffalonians who have made a lasting contribution to the world.&quot;

In 1936, Hofstadter entered the doctoral program in history at Columbia University where his advisor Merle Curti was demonstrating how to synthesize intellectual, social, and political history based upon secondary sources rather than primary-source archival research. In 1938, he became a member of the Communist Party USA, but soon became disillusioned by the Stalinist party discipline and show trials. After withdrawing from the party in August 1939 following the Hitler–Stalin Pact, he retained a critical left-wing perspective that was still obvious in &quot;American Political Tradition&quot; in 1948.

Hofstadter earned his PhD in 1942. In 1944, he published his dissertation &quot;Social Darwinism in American Thought, 1860–1915&quot;. It was a commercially successful (200,000 copies) critique of late-19th-century American capitalism and its ruthless &quot;dog-eat-dog&quot; economic competition and Social Darwinian self-justification. Conservative critics, such as Irwin G. Wylie and Robert C. Bannister, disagreed with his interpretation. The sharpest criticism of the book focused on Hofstadter&#x27;s weakness as a researcher: &quot;he did little or no research into manuscripts, newspapers, archival, or unpublished sources, relying instead primarily on secondary sources augmented by his lively style and wide-ranging interdisciplinary readings, thereby producing well-written arguments based on scattered evidence he found by reading other historians.&quot;

From 1942 to 1946, Hofstadter taught history at the University of Maryland, where he became a close friend of the popular sociologist C. Wright Mills and read extensively in the fields of sociology and psychology, absorbing ideas of Max Weber, Karl Mannheim, Sigmund Freud, and the Frankfurt School. His later books frequently refer to behavioral concepts such as &quot;status anxiety&quot;.

==Assessment as a &quot;consensus historian&quot;==
In 1946, Hofstadter joined Columbia University&#x27;s faculty, and in 1959 he succeeded Allan Nevins as the DeWitt Clinton Professor of American History, where he played a major role in directing Ph.D. dissertations. According to his biographer David Brown, after 1945 Hofstadter philosophically &quot;broke&quot; with Charles A. Beard and moved to the right, becoming leader of the &quot;consensus historians,&quot; a term Hofstadter disapproved of, but that was widely applied to his apparent rejection of the Beardian idea that the sole basis for understanding American history is the fundamental conflict between economic classes.

In a widely held revision of this view, Christopher Lasch wrote that, unlike the &quot;consensus historians&quot; of the 1950s, Hofstadter saw the consensus of classes on behalf of business interests not as a strength but &quot;as a form of intellectual bankruptcy and as a reflection, moreover, not of a healthy sense of the practical but of the domination of American political thought by popular mythologies.&quot;

As early as his &quot;American Political Tradition&quot; (1948), while still viewing politics from a critical left-wing perspective, Hofstadter rejected black-and-white polarization between pro-business and anti-business politicians. Making explicit reference to Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, Cleveland, Bryan, Wilson, and Hoover, Hofstadter made a statement on the consensus in the American political tradition that has been seen as &quot;ironic&quot;. He said:

Hofstadter later complained that this remark in a hastily written preface requested by the editor had been the reason for &quot;lumping him&quot; unfairly into the category of &quot;consensus historians&quot; like Boorstin, who celebrated this kind of ideological consensus as an achievement, whereas Hofstadter deplored it. Hofstadter expressed his dislike of the term &quot;consensus historian&quot; several times, and criticized Boorstin for overusing the consensus and ignoring the essential conflicts in history. In an earlier draft of the preface, he wrote:American politics has always been an arena in which conflicts of interests have been fought out, compromised, adjusted. Once these interests were sectional; now they tend more clearly to follow class lines; but from the beginning American political parties, instead of representing single sections or classes clearly and forcefully, have been intersectional and interclass parties, embracing a jumble of interests which often have reasons for contesting among themselves.

Hofstadter rejected Beard&#x27;s interpretation of history as a succession of exclusively economically motivated group conflicts and financial interests of politicians. He thought that most of the periods of US history, except the Civil War, could be fully understood only by taking into account an implicit consensus, shared by all groups across the conflict lines. He criticized the generation of Beard and Vernon Louis Parrington because they had
In 1948 he published &quot;The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It&quot;, interpretive studies of 12 major American political leaders from the 18th to the 20th centuries. The book was a critical success and sold nearly a million copies at university campuses, where it was used as a history textbook; critics found it &quot;skeptical, fresh, revisionary, occasionally ironical, without being harsh or merely destructive.&quot; Each chapter title illustrated a paradox: Thomas Jefferson is &quot;The Aristocrat as Democrat&quot;; John C. Calhoun is the &quot;Marx of the Master Class&quot;; and Franklin Roosevelt is &quot;The Patrician as Opportunist&quot;. In writing the book, Hofstadter was influenced by literary figures as well as historians: two key influences on him were the critic Edmund Wilson and the novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. Hofstadter&#x27;s style was so powerful and engrossing that professors kept assigning the book long after scholars had revised or rejected its main points.

On April 13, 1970, less than a year before his death, Hofstadter wrote historian Bernard Bailyn, expressing concerns about scholarly depictions of recent studies by both of them as &quot;consensus.&quot; Bailyn&#x27;s response has not yet been examined by third-party sources.

==Later works==
As a historian, Hofstadter&#x27;s groundbreaking work came in using social psychology concepts to explain political history. He explored subconscious motives such as social status anxiety, anti-intellectualism, irrational fear, and paranoia as they propel political discourse and action in politics. Historian Lloyd Gardner wrote that &quot;in later essays Hofstadter specifically ruled out the possibility of a Leninist interpretation of American imperialism.&quot;

===Rural ethos===
&quot;The Age of Reform&quot; (1955) casts the Populist movement as a manifestation of the yeoman ideal in America&#x27;s sentimental attachment to agrarianism and the farm&#x27;s moral superiority to the city. Hofstadter—himself very much a big-city person—noted the agrarian ethos was &quot;a kind of homage that Americans have paid to the fancied innocence of their origins; however, to call it a myth does not imply falsity, because it effectively embodies the rural values of the American people, profoundly influencing their perception of the correct values, hence their political behavior.&quot; In this matter, the stress is on the importance of Jefferson&#x27;s writings, and of his followers, in the development of agrarianism in the US, as establishing the agrarian myth, and its importance, in American life and politics—despite the rural and urban industrialization that rendered the myth moot.

 (1963) and (1965) describe American provincialism, warning against anti-intellectual fear of the cosmopolitan city, presented as wicked by the xenophobic and anti-Semitic Populists of the 1890s. They trace the direct political and ideological lineage between the Populists and anti-communist Senator Joseph McCarthy and McCarthyism, the political paranoia manifest in his time. Hofstadter&#x27;s dissertation director Merle Curti wrote that Hofstadter&#x27;s &quot;position is as biased, by his urban background... as the work of older historians was biased by their rural background and traditional agrarian sympathies.”

===Irrational fear===
 (1969) describes the origins of the First Party System as reflecting fears that the (other) political party threatened to destroy the republic. (1968) systematically analyzes and criticizes the intellectual foundations and historical validity of Beard&#x27;s historiography and revealed Hofstadter&#x27;s increasing inclination toward neoconservatism. Privately, Hofstadter said that Frederick Jackson Turner was no longer a useful guide to history, because he was too obsessed with the frontier and his ideas too often had &quot;a pound of falsehood for every few ounces of truth.&quot;

Howe and Finn argue that, rhetorically, Hofstadter&#x27;s cultural interpretation repeatedly drew upon concepts from literary criticism (&quot;irony,&quot; &quot;paradox,&quot; &quot;anomaly&quot;), anthropology (&quot;myth,&quot; &quot;tradition,&quot; &quot;legend,&quot; &quot;folklore&quot;), and social psychology (&quot;projection,&quot; &quot;unconsciously,&quot; &quot;identity,&quot; &quot;anxiety,&quot; &quot;paranoid&quot;). He artfully employed their explicit scholarly meanings and their informal prejudicial connotations. His goal, they argue, was &quot;destroying certain cherished American traditions and myths derived from his conviction that they provided no trustworthy guide for action in the present.&quot; Thus Hofstadter argued, &quot;The application of depth psychology to politics, chancy though it is, has at least made us acutely aware that politics can be a projective arena for feelings and impulses that are only marginally related to the manifest issues.&quot; C. Vann Woodward wrote that Hofstadter seemed &quot;to have a solid understanding, if not a private affection&quot; for &quot;the odd, the warped, the &#x27;zanies&#x27; and the crazies of American life—left, right and middle.&quot;

==Political views==
Influenced by his wife, Hofstadter was a member of the Young Communist League in college, and in April 1938 he joined the Communist Party USA; he quit in 1939. Hofstadter had been reluctant to join, knowing the orthodoxy it imposed on intellectuals, telling them what to believe and what to write. He was disillusioned by the spectacle of the Moscow Show Trials, but wrote: &quot;I join without enthusiasm but with a sense of obligation... [M]y fundamental reason for joining is that I don&#x27;t like capitalism and want to get rid of it.&quot; He remained anti-capitalist, writing, &quot;I hate capitalism and everything that goes with it,&quot; but was similarly disillusioned with Stalinism, finding the Soviet Union &quot;essentially undemocratic&quot; and the Communist Party rigid and doctrinaire. In the 1940s, Hofstadter abandoned political causes, feeling that intellectuals were no more likely to &quot;find a comfortable home&quot; under socialism than they were under capitalism.

Biographer Susan Baker writes that Hofstadter &quot;was profoundly influenced by the political Left of the 1930s... The philosophical impact of Marxism was so intense and direct during Hofstadter&#x27;s formative years that it formed a major part of his identity crisis... The impact of these years created his orientation to the American past, accompanied as it was by marriage, establishment of life-style, and choice of profession.&quot; Geary concludes that, &quot;To Hofstadter, radicalism always offered more of a critical intellectual stance than a commitment to political activism. Although Hofstadter quickly became disillusioned with the Communist Party, he retained an independent left-wing standpoint well into the 1940s. His first book, &quot;Social Darwinism in American Thought&quot; (1944), and &quot;The American Political Tradition&quot; (1948) had a radical point of view.&quot;

In the 1940s, Hofstadter cited Beard as &quot;the exciting influence on me&quot;. Hofstadter specifically responded to Beard&#x27;s social-conflict model of U.S. history, which emphasized the struggle among competing economic groups (primarily farmers, Southern slavers, Northern industrialists, and workers) and discounted abstract political rhetoric that rarely translated into action. Beard encouraged historians to search for economic belligerents&#x27; hidden self-interest and financial goals. By the 1950s and 1960s, Hofstadter had a strong reputation in liberal circles. Lawrence Cremin wrote that &quot;Hofstadter&#x27;s central purpose in writing history ... was to reformulate American liberalism so that it might stand more honestly and effectively against attacks from both left and right in a world which had accepted the essential insights of Darwin, Marx, and Freud.&quot; Alfred Kazin identified his use of parody: &quot;He was a derisive critic and parodist of every American Utopia and its wild prophets, a natural oppositionist to fashion and its satirist, a creature suspended between gloom and fun, between disdain for the expected and mad parody.&quot;

In 2008, conservative commentator George Will called Hofstadter &quot;the iconic public intellectual of liberal condescension&quot; who &quot;dismissed conservatives as victims of character flaws and psychological disorders—a &#x27;paranoid style&#x27; of politics rooted in &#x27;status anxiety.&#x27; etc. Conservatism rose on a tide of votes cast by people irritated by the liberalism of condescension.&quot;

==Later life==
Angered by the radical politics of the 1960s, and especially by the student occupation and temporary closure of Columbia University in 1968, Hofstadter began to criticize student activist methods. His friend David Herbert Donald said, &quot;as a liberal who criticized the liberal tradition from within, he was appalled by the growing radical, even revolutionary, sentiment that he sensed among his colleagues and his students. He could never share their simplistic, moralistic approach.&quot; Brick says he regarded them as &quot;simple-minded, moralistic, ruthless, and destructive.&quot; Moreover, he was &quot;extremely critical of student tactics, believing that they were based on irrational romantic ideas, rather than sensible plans for achievable change, that they undermined the unique status of the university, as an institutional bastion of free thought, and that they were bound to provoke a political reaction from the right.&quot; Coates argues that his career saw a steady move from left to right, and that his 1968 Columbia commencement address &quot;represented the completion of his conversion to conservatism&quot;.

Despite strongly disagreeing with their political methods, he invited his radical students to discuss goals and strategy with him. He even employed one, Mike Wallace, to collaborate with him on &quot;American Violence: A Documentary History&quot; (1970); Hofstadter student Eric Foner said the book &quot;utterly contradicted the consensus vision of a nation placidly evolving without serious disagreements.&quot;

Hofstadter planned to write a three-volume history of American society. At his death, he had only completed the first volume, &quot;America at 1750: A Social Portrait&quot; (1971).

==Death and legacy==
Hofstadter died of leukemia on October 24, 1970, at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, at age 54. He showed more interest in his research than in his teaching. In undergraduate classes, he read aloud the draft of his next book. Hofstadter directed more than 100 finished doctoral dissertations but gave his graduate students only cursory attention; he believed this academic latitude enabled them to find their own models of history. Among them were Herbert Gutman, Eric Foner, Lawrence W. Levine, Linda Kerber, and Paula S. Fass. Some, such as Eric McKitrick and Stanley Elkins, were more conservative than he; Hofstadter had few disciples and founded no school of history writing.

Following Hofstadter&#x27;s death, Columbia dedicated a locked bookcase of his works in Butler Library to him. When the library&#x27;s physical conditions deteriorated, his widow Beatrice asked that it be removed.

Richard Hofstadter Fellowship is a fellowship at Columbia University conferred upon an entering graduate student.

== Personal life ==
Hofstadter married Beatrice Kevitt in 1947. She taught American history at Brooklyn College in the 1960s. After his passing, she married the journalist Theodore White in 1974.

<doc id="514698" wikidata="Q3586417" url="?curid=514698" title="1960 Quebec general election">
<text>The 1960 Quebec general election was held on June 22, 1960, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec, Canada. It was one of the most significant elections in Quebec history, rivalled perhaps only by the 1976 general election. The incumbent Union Nationale, led by Antonio Barrette, was defeated by the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Jean Lesage.

The 1960 election set the stage for the Quiet Revolution, a major social transformation of all aspects of Quebec society throughout the 1960s. Among many other changes, the influence and power of the Catholic Church fell sharply as Quebec became a secular society.

This election put an end to 16 years of continuous Union Nationale rule, much of it under Maurice Duplessis. Duplessis had died in 1959, ending a period that was later derisively referred to as &quot;La Grande Noirceur&quot; (the Great Darkness).

Duplessis&#x27; successor, longtime minister Paul Sauvé, saw the need to modernize a government that had long been one of the most conservative provincial governments in Canada. He initiated a &quot;hundred days of change&quot; that began to transform Quebec society, but they were cut short when Sauvé died suddenly after only a few months in office. He was succeeded by another longtime minister, Antonio Barrette. However, with its second new leader in less than a year and its third in less than two years, and no published platform, the Union Nationale was thus in disarray when it went into the election.

==Background==
On September 7, 1959, Maurice Duplessis died during a visit to the northern mining town of Schefferville. His nearly 20 years as premier (interrupted from 1939 to 1944 by Adélard Godbout) were marked by conservatism, clientelism, deference to the Catholic hierarchy, defence of provincial powers from federal interference, opposition to Keynesianism, and fierce anti-syndicalism. Contrary to some accounts of the Grande Noirceur, however, Quebec in the late 1950s was on the path to modernization, with a largely urbanized population and a significant manufacturing sector.

Three days after the death of &quot;le Chef&quot; (&quot;the Boss&quot;), the cabinet chose Paul Sauvé as his successor. Sauvé undertook his &quot;100 days&quot; of change under the slogan &quot;désormais &quot; (&quot;From now on&quot;), determined to modernize the machinery of government after years of stagnation under Duplessis. On January 2, 1960, while he had wind in his sails and threatened the Liberals&#x27; momentum, the new premier died suddenly in Saint-Eustache, in his riding of Deux-Montagnes. On January 7, Antonio Barrette was chosen as premier. The party thus headed into the election with its third leader in under a year. Further undermining the government&#x27;s stability was the exposure of the natural gas scandal, reported by &quot;Le Devoir&quot; on June 13, 1958.

Jean Lesage had been elected leader of the Liberal Party on May 31, 1958, succeeding Georges-Émile Lapalme. Lesage aimed to take advantage of the government&#x27;s setbacks. Particularly critical of official corruption and Union Nationale policies on federal-provincial relations, he promised to create a &quot;strong and dynamic state&quot; against the &quot;occupying regime&quot;. The party could also count on recently recruited star candidate René Lévesque to promote its program.

In addition to the two main parties, the Social Democratic Party (the Quebec branch of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation) participated in the election, led by trade unionist Michel Chartrand. Lacking funds, however, it failed to present a candidate.

On March 18, 1960, an Act was passed that raised the number of seats in the legislature to 95:

:* Duplessis, named in honour of the late premier, was created from parts of Saguenay.
:* Bourget was carved out of Laval.

The writ of election dropped on April 27, setting the electoral campaign in motion.

==Campaign==
Despite the Liberal Party&#x27;s ambitious program and the disarray of the UN, it was difficult to predict the outcome of the vote at the outset of the campaign. The incumbent party still enjoyed significant support and many constituencies faced close races. No leaders&#x27; debate was held as the parties could not agree on a format.

The campaign revolved around the two leaders, Barrette and Lesage. Barrette stressed continuity with his predecessors, frequently appearing in publicity campaigns featuring Duplessis and Sauvé. He travelled across the province, relying more on voters&#x27; faith in him personally than on an electoral platform, which the UN did not publish. At the beginning of the campaign, he even wrote in the party&#x27;s organ Montréal-Matin: &quot;Our program was formulated in 1931 and current legislation bears witness to its implementation.&quot;

Lesage meanwhile led an &quot;American-style&quot; campaign, focusing on voter outreach to counter the public&#x27;s perception of him as haughty. He took inspiration from Harry Truman, sometimes spending up to three days in the same region listening to local demands.

The majority of races were two- and three-way contests, but some ridings had more fractured campaigns:

===Controversy in L&#x27;Assomption===

After a judicial recount, the UN had won L&#x27;Assomption by only one vote. In July 1961, a panel of judges overturned the result, voiding the reelection of Victor-Stanislas Chartrand and declaring the Liberal candidate Frédéric Coiteux the victor by 10 votes. Allegations of voter impersonation, threats and bribery were cited by the judges in voiding 11 votes in the count. Chartrand had attempted to resign his seat and thus trigger a byelection, but that was not accepted pending the outcome in court.

<doc id="514705" wikidata="Q1959686" url="?curid=514705" title="Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes">
<text>The Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (NAAFI ) is a company created by the British government on 9 December 1920 to run recreational establishments needed by the British Armed Forces, and to sell goods to servicemen and their families. It runs clubhouses, bars, shops, supermarkets, launderettes, restaurants, cafés and other facilities on most British military bases and also canteens on board Royal Navy ships. Commissioned officers are not usually supposed to use the NAAFI clubs and bars, since their messes provide these facilities and their entry, except on official business, is considered to be an intrusion into junior ranks&#x27; private lives.
NAAFI personnel serving aboard ship are part of the Naval Canteen Service (NCS), wear naval uniform and have action stations, but remain ordinary civilians. NAAFI personnel can also join the Expeditionary Force Institutes (EFI), which provides NAAFI facilities in war zones. EFI personnel are members of the Army Reserve serving on special engagements, who bear ranks and wear uniform. NCS personnel can similarly volunteer to join the Royal Navy when it goes on active service.

==Background==
In 1892, the Hon. Lionel Fortescue, Canteen President of the 17th Lancers, became dissatisfied with the corrupt way in which canteen finances were being handled. He established a system for keeping a locked till in the canteen and put Sergeant John Gardner in charge, an honest and able man who would later look after hundreds and thousands of pounds as one of the staff of the Navy and Army Canteen Board during the First World War.

The locked till practice was soon adopted by other regiments, until another Canteen Officer, Major Harry Crauford of the Grenadier Guards was also dissatisfied with the food provided for his canteen and approached Lionel Fortescue with the idea of forming a co-operative society and doing their own buying. Together, they managed to raise £400 and founded the Canteen and Mess Co-operative Society. The rule was that interest was not to exceed five percent and all further profits were to be handed to the regimental canteens as a rebate.

They hoped that in time the co-operative would become a buying and distributing agency for the whole Army. In August 1914, all arrangements were upset by the outbreak of the First World War.

The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) - the greater part of Britain&#x27;s regular Army - was sent to France and hundreds of thousands of young men enlisted to fight for the King and the country.

The Government was unprepared for the problem of supplying and feeding the forces on a scale never before experienced, so a large Army entered the field with insufficient official provision. Fortunately the Canteen and Mess Society was still active and was the only contractor which was more concerned with the welfare of the troops than with making money. The Head of the society was summoned to the War Office together with the managing director of Richard Dickenson &amp; Co., the soundest and most experienced firm of the canteen contractors. The two organisations were invited to establish a special department and subsequently joined as the Expeditionary Canteens to serve the nation.

Even with the extra money and their combined strength, the service could not be increased fast enough to match the huge expansion of the Armed Forces. In the meantime, many new contractors were finding loopholes for exploiting the situation and it became clear that safeguards were needed to protect the interests of the soldiers and supervise the operations of all these vested interests.

In January 1915, a Board of Control was formed and exactly two years later the Army Canteen Committee was registered at the Board of Trade as a company trading not for profit. It absorbed the Canteen and Mess Society, and took over the contracts of Dickenson&#x27;s and all the other firms supplying the Army in the UK. Within three months it also took over all canteens abroad where British troops were stationed during peace times. The Expeditionary Force Canteens were left in charge in the main theatres of war.

In June 1917, the Royal Navy was keen to share in the benefits now being felt by the British soldier and so the Army Canteen Committee assumed the new title of the Navy and Army Canteen Board. When the Royal Air Force (RAF) became a separate arm of the nation&#x27;s defences in 1918, their canteens were absorbed into the Navy and Army Canteen Board.

Lionel Fortescue&#x27;s vision of a unified canteen system for the Forces was starting to take shape and the nucleus of NAAFI was now in place.

==Establishment==
After the First World War, the Expeditionary Force Canteens (EFC) and the Navy and Army Canteen Board (NACB) did not return to the gratitude of the nation. This was because EFC had made a large amount of profit from the sales of goods to the troops and opinion was divided as to what should be done with the money.

In March 1920, Winston Churchill, then Secretary of State for War, set up a committee to advise on the kind of organisation which would be needed for the Armed Forces in the future. The findings were unanimous; there should be one organisation to serve all three services, it should be permanent and it should be able to rapidly expand or contract at times of war or peace. The Navy, Army, Air Force Institutes was therefore established on 6 December 1920 and started trading as NAAFI in 1921.
As a not for profit organisation, with no shareholders to reward, NAAFI was asked to run the catering and recreational establishments needed by the armed forces. It had to make a profit for the good of the NAAFI customers - the men and women of the British Armed Forces- and so in addition it undertook to sell goods to servicemen and their families over and above those that were initially provided by the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC). The servicemen would benefit directly by getting cash rebates and discounts on purchases and indirectly through surpluses given back as a whole from each year&#x27;s trading.

For the first time the troops overseas were able to buy the same things in the canteen abroad as they could at home. NAAFI first saw overseas service in Ireland in 1922. Six years later NAAFI would have a presence in Bermuda, Ceylon, Germany, Gibraltar, Iraq, China, Jamaica, Malta, and the Middle East.

==Second World War==

The NAAFI&#x27;s greatest contribution was during the Second World War. The Chairman &amp; CEO during the war years was Sir Lancelot Royle and by April 1944 the NAAFI ran 7,000 canteens and had 96,000 personnel (expanded from fewer than 600 canteens and 4,000 personnel in 1939). It also controlled ENSA, the forces entertainment organisation. In the 1940 Battle of France alone, the EFI had nearly 3,000 personnel and 230 canteens.

Male EFI personnel were members of the Royal Army Service Corps until 1965, then the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. Since 1993 they have been members of the Royal Logistic Corps. Female personnel were members of the Auxiliary Territorial Service until 1949, then the Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps until 1992, when they joined the RAOC (and later the RLC).

==Falklands War==
Petty Officer John Leake, NCS canteen manager onboard HMS &quot;Ardent&quot;, was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) in the 1982 Falklands War for his courage while manning a machine gun.

==In popular culture==
* The movie &quot;Carry On Sergeant&quot;, the first in the Carry On movies, is set in a National Service depot, many scenes are set in the base NAAFI.
* The 1950s BBC Radio comedy series &quot;The Goon Show&quot; often made reference to the NAAFI in scripts, mostly by Peter Sellers&#x27; character, Major Dennis Bloodnok. One episode was entitled &quot;The Jet-Propelled Guided NAAFI&quot;. In the episode &quot;Operation Christmas Duff&quot;, NAAFI is described as &quot;an organisation working for the downfall of the British Army.&quot;
* The expression, &quot;You&#x27;re as dim as a NAAFI candle,&quot; (i.e. stupid) is an update of the Great War veteran&#x27;s slang &quot;dim as a Toc H lamp&quot;.
* The expression to lie &quot;like a cheap NAAFI watch&quot; unfairly relies on the supposed shoddy workmanship of said equipment.
* In the &quot;Camping In&quot; episode of &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, when Mr Rumbold mentions he was in the Army Catering Corps, Mr Lucas incorrectly assumes that Mr Rumbold actually worked in the NAAFI. He angrily exclaims, &quot;You were in THE NAAFI?&quot; Additionally, in season 1 episode 2 of &quot;Grace &amp; Favour&quot;, Miss Brahms replies to a statement by Captain Peacock by saying, &quot;He used to cycle down to the NAAFI to get his five Woodbines,&quot; after he mentions that when he was in the Army, he &quot;did occasionally climb into the saddle&quot;.
* In chapter 16 of &quot;Lucky Jim&quot;, Dixon recalls that Margaret&#x27;s face reminded him of a man who &quot;had never been seen doing anything except sweeping out the NAAFI and wiping his nose on his sleeve.&quot;
* In J. Lee Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Ice Cold in Alex&quot;, a character questions whether the gin is imported or NAAFI, raising concerns about the spirit&#x27;s quality.
* The NAAFI is continuously mentioned throughout Spike Milligan&#x27;s war memoirs. Every week his artillery unit is serviced by the NAAFI, who bring round the NAAFI rations of cigarettes, etc., as well as selling various other sundries such as shoelaces. Even when Milligan leaves the Army, as he is part of an army entertainment troupe, he still gets issued with a NAAFI ration each week.
* In the sitcom &quot;Get Some In&quot; about RAF conscripts doing their National Service, in about every other episode there is a NAAFI canteen scene.
* &quot;Lovejoy&quot; season 3, episode 5, scene 3 has Tinker Dill proclaiming he, &quot;Left his sense of adventure behind in the NAAFI in 1953.&quot;

In addition to being the name of the institute, NAAFI is also used in British service talk as a noun for a type of break, i.e. a &quot;NAAFI break&quot;, which is a short break or tea break; or an insult to the character of another soldier, e.g. &quot;He&#x27;s NAAFI!&quot; (No Aim, Ambition and Fuck-all Interest). NAAFI has been humorously said to mean &quot;Never &#x27;Ave Any Fags In&quot;, referring to frequent shortages of cigarettes. A &quot;NAAFI sandwich&quot; consists of two pieces of bread spread with margarine placed together; that is, it is a &quot;sandwich&quot; with no filling.

==Today==
NAAFI now operates out of bases in British Forces Germany, Brunei, Gibraltar, the South Atlantic Islands and onboard HM Ships through the Naval Canteen Service (NCS). In Germany, it provides the supply of all catering, retail and leisure. This includes running the officers&#x27; and NCOs&#x27; messes, providing the catering service as well as a number of retail outlets, coffee forums, bars and the sale of tax-free cars.

<text>Moreton Island (Mulgumpin) is an island on the eastern side of Moreton Bay on the coast of South East Queensland, Australia. The Coral Sea lies on the east coast of the island. Moreton Island lies northeast of the Queensland capital, Brisbane. 98% of the island is contained within a national park and a popular destination for day trippers, four wheel driving, camping, recreational angling and whale watching and a 75-minute ferry ride from Brisbane. It is the third largest sand island in the world. Together with K&#x27;gari, Moreton Island forms the largest sand structure in the world. It was the traditional country of the Ngugi before settlement.

The island is within the City of Brisbane and is gazetted into four localities, the small townships of Bulwer (on the north-west coast), Cowan Cowan (on the west coast) and Kooringal (on the south-west coast) with the bulk of the island being the locality of Moreton Island. The private Tangalooma Island Resort is also within the locality of Moreton Island. All residential areas are located on the western coast of the island facing Moreton Bay.

The island was named by Matthew Flinders. At least five lighthouses have been built on the island. A small number of residents live in four small settlements. Tangalooma was the site of a whaling station. Access to the island is by vehicular barge or passenger ferry services. Moreton Island is a popular destination for camping and fishing.

It is one of the wettest parts of the City of Brisbane with precipitation spread evenly throughout the year compared to other parts of South East Queensland. Cape Moreton receives an annual average rainfall of .

==Geography==
The island covers an area of approximately , and extends for from north to south and is at its widest point. Cape Moreton, at the north eastern tip of the island, is the only rock outcrop on the island. It was named &quot;Cape Morton&quot; by Captain James Cook in May 1770, and was at that time assumed to be part of the mainland. The current spelling came about because of a clerical error later.

The highest point on the island is named Mount Tempest, which at is reputedly the highest, stabilised, coastal sandhill in the world. Close to Mount Tempest is another large sandhill—Storm Mountain at . High parabolic dunes are found along a central spine. Behind the beaches are many sand blow-outs where disturbances in natural dune vegetation has permitted high winds to blow sand inland.

Moreton Island has a few freshwater lakes. A number of perched and window lakes have formed on the island over many years. As the water table beneath the Island fills with rain water large lakes are formed, with Blue Lagoon being the largest and most popular on the Eastern side of the island. Honeyeater Lake, renowned for its birdlife is the smaller sister lake to Blue Lagoon. Dolphin Lake near Tangalooma named because it resembles a wild dolphin. The smallest and most impressive is Lake Trusiak near Bulwer named after Polish island adventurer George Trusiak.
Four small settlements exist on the western side of the island. The northernmost of these is Bulwer near the north western corner of the island, whilst Cowan Cowan is approximately further south. Approximately further south lies the private Tangalooma Island Resort. This former whaling station features the Tangalooma Marine Education and Conservation Centre (TMECC) and is known for its dolphin feeding and wreck diving. Tangalooma is the main access point to the island with regular passenger ferry and vehicular barge services. The island&#x27;s main airstrip is long and lies between Cowan Cowan and Tangalooma. The other settlement is Kooringal which is located near the southern tip of the island. This township has its own airstrip and was serviced by a vehicular barge that ran to Amity Point on North Stradbroke Island until April 2009 when the barge was sold off due to limited business and high operation costs. A new vehicular barge called the Amity Trader now services the same route.

Fort Cowan Cowan, an old World War II bunker and fortification complex that was used to protect the approaches to Moreton Bay, is located north of Cape Cowan Cowan. The bar between the two islands is known as South Passage and is dangerous to cross in high seas.

=== Climate ===
Moreton Island experiences a marine-moderated humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa with very warm, muggy summers and mild, pleasant winters. Precipitation is abundant year-round, averaging annually, and wind speeds are high, averaging at 3 pm, in part due to its exposed location.

==History==
Moreton Island is the traditional home of the Ngugi tribe. The islands contains numerous shell middens, indicating Aboriginal occupation of the island for at least 2000 years. While James Cook named the main headland on the island Cape Morton on the 17 May 1770, due to a clerical error those that came after him mistakenly used &quot;Moreton&quot;. Matthew Flinders, on 31 July 1799, named the island after the Cape. Castaways Thomas Pamphlett, John Finnegan and Richard Parsons traversed the island in March and April 1823 before heading to the mainland via Stradbroke Island. The Ngugi, who comprised an estimated 100 people, together with the Nunukul of North Stradbroke Island, clashed with whites establishing a presence on their islands, usually over matters related to native women. Between July 1831 and December 1832 some 30 to 40 of both groups were wounded or killed. In one sortie arranged by Captain Clunie of the 17th Regiment, a score of Ngugi, surprised by a dawn ambush, were shot down at a fresh water lagoon near the southern end of Moreton Island.*

European residents settled on the island in 1848, after the &quot;Sovereign&quot; shipwrecked on the island and a pilot station was established at Bulwer. This pilot station was operated until 1909. The clipper &quot;Young Australia&quot; was wrecked on Moreton Island in 1872.

At Cape Moreton is Queensland&#x27;s oldest lighthouse, Cape Moreton Light, which was first lit in 1857. The lighthouse was followed by at least four other lighthouse erected since the 1860s, at Comboyuro Point, North Point, Cowan Cowan Point and Yellow Patch. During World War II, a number of defence installations were installed on the island by the Royal Australian Navy and Australian Army. These sites included anti aircraft guns and mine control buildings. Their purpose was to protect the approaches to the port of Brisbane and at its peak 900 troops were stationed on the island.

Between 1952 and 1962, Tangalooma, on the western side of the island, was the site of Queensland&#x27;s only whaling station, with humpback whales being harvested on their annual migration north. Each season up to 600 whales were processed with a maximum of 11 whales per day. The site of the whaling station is now the Tangalooma Island Resort. The flensing plan of the station still exists as part of the resort.

Moreton Island was included in the Greater Brisbane area in 1974. The council initially permitted 60% of the island to potentially be sandmined, however a public outcry led to the council changing the zoning to open space. The sands on the island contain rutile and zircon. The Queensland Government, led by Joh Bjelke-Petersen supported sandmining on the island and established the Cook Inquiry which produced a report recommending that 94% of the island be banned from mining. Despite this more mining licences were granted until 1984 when the Federal government announced it would decline export licences for the island&#x27;s mineral sands. In 1989, then Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss halted mining of the island and compensated the companies involved.

A salt-water lagoon on the island was used as a temporary home to a dugong called Pig. Pig was the youngest dugong ever successfully reared in captivity. The dugong was placed in the lagoon to increase its natural instincts before being released into the wild.

===Pacific Adventurer oil spill===
On 11 March 2009 the container ship &quot;MV Pacific Adventurer&quot; lost bunker oil and cargo north of Moreton Island during heavy seas that were generated by Tropical Cyclone Hamish. The ship reportedly lost 31 containers of ammonium nitrate and as much as 230 tonnes of bunker oil. The spilled bunker oil was washed ashore on beaches along the northern end of Moreton Island including Honeymoon Bay, as well as along Bribie Island and beaches on the Sunshine Coast. These have been deemed disaster areas, although a controversy has arisen as to the lack of early response as well as the refusal to accept offers of help or allow access to clean up the area.

The ship&#x27;s owners face the possibility of up to 2 million in fines and the skipper could have to pay up to $200,000. They may also be liable for up to $250 million for environmental damage to the shoreline.

Britain&#x27;s Swire Shipping Ltd., the Hong Kong-registered ship&#x27;s owner, said containers aboard the ship had slipped from the deck as it rocked in cyclone-stirred waters, ripping a hole in a bunker oil tank and spilling the equivalent of more than of bunk oil into the sea. Later, the company said a diver&#x27;s inspection of the hull had led it to conclude the amount of spilled bunk oil was &quot;significantly more&quot; than that, but did not give a replacement figure.

===Native title recognition===
The Quandamooka people were granted native title of Mulgumpin on 27 November 2019. Joint management of the national park gives responsibility for camping book to the Quandamooka Yoolooburrabee Aboriginal Corporation

==Heritage listings==
Moreton Island has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Cape Moreton: Cape Moreton Lightstation
* 25 Dorothy Newnham Street: Signal Station, Moreton Island
* 30 Jessie Wadsworth Street: Fort Cowan Cowan (Cowan Cowan Battery)

The island was also listed in 1981 on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

==Recreation==
Established in 1966, 98% of the island is contained within the Moreton Island National Park, which has a World Conservation Union (IUCN) category of II. The park is managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.
Camping and four wheel driving is permitted and possible in many parts, with the appropriate fee. Motor vehicle access is by ferry, but is for four wheel drive vehicles only, as there are no sealed roads on the island. Camping is permitted, however permits must be obtained on the mainland. There are plenty of recreational activities including sand tobogganing which Moreton is famous for, snorkeling &amp; diving, bird watching, feeding dolphins, whale watching from land, fishing and parasailing.

There are more islands to the south, South Stradbroke Island and North Stradbroke Island, and to the north; Bribie Island and Fraser Island (reputed to be the biggest sand island in the world, Moreton Island being the third largest to Fraser).

===Management plan===
The Queensland Government implemented a new management plan called the Moreton Island Management Plan on 1 July 2007. This plan includes a new camping booking system, designated routes for quads, trikes and trail bikes and other zoning which defines rules for access and recreational opportunities. The plan incorporated existing fire management plans, pest and plant control measures and feral animal eradication programs.

==Transport==
Access to the island is via vehicle ferry service from the Moreton Island Adventures MICAT at Port of Brisbane in Lytton, and the resort passenger services on the Tangalooma Island Resort Fleet departing from the Brisbane River at Holt St Pinkenba. A service from Amity Point on North Stradbroke Island was discontinued. Timetable details are available at . The Combie Trader barge service from Scarborough in Redcliffe City to Bulwer no longer operates. It ceased in July 2008 due to matters with the terminal and landing areas.

There is no public bus service on the island. Tours and taxi transfers by four wheel drive (off-road) vehicles operate from Bulwer. Private vehicles may be brought to the island by ferry. They can be driven on the island but require a vehicle access permit as the island is a national park. Four wheel drive (off-road) vehicles are necessary as roads are unsealed and often sandy tracks beyond resort areas. Many beaches, particularly on the east shore, also serve as roads. There is little or no petrol on the island.

<text>The Grand Fleet was the main battlefleet of the Royal Navy during the First World War. It was established in August 1914 and disbanded in April 1919. Its main base was Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands.

==History==

Formed in August 1914 from the First Fleet and part of the Second Fleet of the Home Fleets, the Grand Fleet included 25–35 modern capital ships. It was commanded initially by Admiral Sir John Jellicoe.

The 10th Cruiser Squadron carried out the Northern Patrol between Shetland and Norway and cruisers from Cromarty and Rosyth operated a second line (and screened the fleet) in enforcing the blockade of Germany. The administrative complications of the distant blockade across the northern exits of the North Sea overwhelmed the capacity of Vice Admiral Francis Miller, the Base Admiral in Chief from 7 August 1914, devolving on the commander in chief, Admiral John Jellicoe. To relieve the administrative burdens on Miller and Jellicoe, the post of the Admiral of the Orkneys and Shetlands was created to oversee the defence of the islands, naval bases and shore duties. Vice-Admiral Stanley Colville was appointed to the command (7 September 1914 – 19 January 1916) with Miller under his authority.

Admiral Jellicoe was significantly concerned about the possibility of submarine or destroyer attacks on Scapa Flow. While the Grand Fleet spent almost the first year of the war patrolling the west coast of the British Isles, their base at Scapa was defensively reinforced, beginning with over sixty blockships sunk in the many entrance channels between the southern islands to enable the use of submarine nets and booms. These blocked approaches were backed by minefields, artillery and concrete barriers.

Admiral Jellicoe was succeeded by Admiral Sir David Beatty in December 1916.

The Grand Fleet was based first at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands, and later at Rosyth on the Firth of Forth. It participated with the biggest fleet action of the war – the Battle of Jutland – in June 1916.

After the Battle of Jutland, the German High Seas Fleet rarely ventured out of its bases at Wilhelmshaven and Kiel in the last two years of the war to engage with the British fleet.

Following the German defeat, 74 ships of the High Seas Fleet () of the Imperial German Navy () were interned in Gutter Sound at Scapa Flow pending a decision on their future in the peace Treaty of Versailles.

During April 1919 the Grand Fleet was disbanded, with much of its strength forming a new Atlantic Fleet.

Most of the interned German warships were later scuttled despite Royal Navy attempts to save them.

==Order of battle==
Not all the Grand Fleet was available for use at any one time, because ships required maintenance and repairs. At the time of the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, it had 32 dreadnought and super-dreadnought battleships. Of these, 28 were in the order of battle at Jutland.

The actual strength of the fleet varied through the war as new ships were built and others were transferred or sunk but the number of battleships steadily increased, adding to the margin of superiority over the German fleet. After the USA joined the war, the US Battleship Division Nine was attached to the Grand Fleet as the Sixth Battle Squadron, adding four, later five, dreadnought battleships.
The order of battle of the Grand Fleet at the end of the war in 1918 included 35 dreadnought battleships and 11 battlecruisers. Twenty ships had been completed since the outbreak of war. Five of these ships were from the United States Navy and one from the Royal Australian Navy. It had five battle squadrons, each of four to ten capital ships, plus the flagship HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, three cruiser squadrons, the &quot;Flying Squadron&quot; of seaplane carriers, and six destroyer flotillas, with another destroyer flotilla and three minesweeper flotillas under its command. The Battle Cruiser Force was two battle squadrons and the flagship (9 ships in total), and five cruiser squadrons (21 ships).

<doc id="514712" wikidata="Q1596245" url="?curid=514712" title="Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge">
<text>The Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge spans the St. Marys River between the United States and Canada connecting the twin cities of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. The bridge is operated by the International Bridge Administration under the direction of the Sault Ste. Marie Bridge Authority, a bi-national governing body consisting of four directors appointed by the governor of Michigan and four appointed by the Canadian government-owned Federal Bridge Corporation.

==Description==
The Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge is the tenth-busiest passenger crossing on the Canada–United States border, and the only land crossing for almost 700 miles (1125 km). It serves as the northern terminus of Interstate 75 (I-75). The bridge construction began in 1960 and officially opened to traffic on October 31, 1962. Contractors included Massman Construction Co. of Kansas City, MO and Bethlehem Steel of Bethlehem, PA. Daily operation is carried on by the International Bridge Administration (IBA) under the supervision of the Sault Ste. Marie Bridge Authority (SSMBA). The SSMBA replaced the previous Joint International Bridge Authority (JIBA) in 2009, which in turn had succeeded the International Bridge Authority (IBA, created in 1935) in 2000.

This is a steel truss arch bridge with a suspended deck. There are two separate spans, a double arch span on the U.S. side and a single arch span on the Canadian side. The double arch spans cross the four U.S. Soo Locks. The single arch spans the single Canadian Lock. In Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, the bridge ends at a city street, Huron Street, in the downtown core. The total length of the bridge approaches . The Bridge allows bicycles to cross, but the lack of dedicated bike lanes requires cyclists to take proper precautions to ensure visibility.

The International Bridge Bus was operated by the CLM Community Action Agency (CLMCAA) of Sault Ste Marie Michigan. Bridge bus border crossings by CLMCAA ceased in March 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 border restrictions between Canada and the U.S. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the bridge bus crossed hourly from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm on weekdays serving both downtown areas and Lake Superior State University on the Michigan side and the Station Mall on the Ontario side.

A tourist information radio station, CIRS, broadcast at 530 AM from the Ontario side of the bridge from 1986 to 2010.

==History==

In 1954 the state of Michigan created the International Bridge Authority. Canada followed in 1955, creating the St.Mary&#x27;s River Co. The bridge was opened in 1962.

In 1975, the bridge had its 10 millionth crossing.

Beginning in 1987, an annual International Bridge Walk has been held on the last Saturday in June, starting on the Michigan side, with participants finishing in Ontario.

On June 6, 2005, the Ontario government announced a construction project to build a dedicated truck bypass route to connect the bridge to Highway 17 in the north end of the city. The city had lobbied for this for some time, since the bridge&#x27;s terminus at a city street was viewed by many residents of the city as a safety concern; however, the bridge terminus itself cannot be easily relocated due to the already highly urbanized nature of the Sault, Ontario waterfront. The truck route, known as Carmen&#x27;s Way in memory of the city&#x27;s former federal MP Carmen Provenzano, was officially opened in September 2006.

Construction work commenced in 2009 on a project to expand and modernize the Canadian bridge plaza, including a larger Canada Border Services Agency building with improved truck inspection facilities and a dedicated route to take trucks directly to Carmen&#x27;s Way, thereby eliminating the need for trucking traffic to enter Huron Street.

Beginning in May 2014, construction work began to completely rebuild the toll plaza/border crossing on the Michigan side of the bridge with an entirely new facility. This was needed to better accommodate truck traffic and meet current capacity. This was completed on October 21, 2015. The 100 millionth crossing occurred on March 1, 2018.

==Border crossing==
The Sault Sainte Marie Border Crossing connects the cities of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario at the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge. The US Port of Entry was established in 1843, as the cities on each shore of the river grew. Regular ferry service began in 1865, and border inspection services in both the US and Canada were provided at the ferry terminals since the early 1900s. Ferry service ended in 1962 when the International Bridge spanning the river was completed. Railroad trains cross the border on the adjacent Sault Ste. Marie International Railroad Bridge which was built in 1887.

<doc id="514714" wikidata="Q37786" url="?curid=514714" title="Pyrenean Sheepdog">
<text>The Pyrenean Sheepdog, the Chien de Berger des Pyrénées in French, is a small to medium-sized breed of herding dog from the Pyrenees Mountains region of France. It is found herding flocks of sheep throughout the Pyrenees alongside the much larger Pyrenean Mountain Dog which is kept as a flock guardian.

The Pyrenean Sheepdog is found in three coat types, the long-haired and goat-haired (together called the Chien de Berger des Pyrénées À Poil Long) as well as the smooth-faced (called the Chien de Berger des Pyrénées À Face Rase); the latter is recognised as a separate breed from the former two by the Société Centrale Canine.

== History ==
The Pyrenean Sheepdog is found along the entire length of the French Pyrenees and is even known in Basque Country to the west. The breed is one of a number of similar rough-coated sheep herding-type breeds found throughout Europe including the Briard and Berger Picard from France, the Barbado da Terceira and Cao da Serra de Aires from the Azores and Portugal, the Polish Lowland Sheepdog from Poland, the Gos d&#x27;atura from Catalonia, the Pastore Fonnese from Sardinia, the Bearded Collie, Border Collie, Rough Collie and extinct Welsh Hillman from Britain, the Schafpudel from Germany, and the Schapendoes from Holland, as well as the Armant from Egypt (descended from French Briards). A number of scholars believe it is possible the ancestors of these herding-type dogs were introduced to Europe during Indo-European migrations over 4,000 years ago, and they spread throughout the continent evolving through selective breeding into the regional breeds with certain physical characteristics to suit the demands or preferences of the region.

Traditionally the Pyrenean Sheepdog is one of two breeds maintained by shepherds in the Pyrenees, the larger Pyrenean Mountain Dog was used as a flock guardian, protecting flocks from depredation from local predators (in particular wolves), as well as from thieves; the smaller Pyrenean Sheepdog was used to herd the flocks, an important function over the summer months when the flocks are grazed on mountain pastures.

The Pyrenean Sheepdog was first recognised by the Société Centrale Canine in 1926; today they recognise it as two breeds, the first the long-haired or Chien de Berger des Pyrénées À Poil Long and the second the smooth-faced or Chien de Berger des Pyrénées À Face Rase.

The Pyrenean Sheepdog is still used as a herding dog in the Pyrenees region, in France the breed is sometimes called the Labrit or Labri or the Berger des Pyrénées, it is often referred to as the Petit Berger which means Little Shepherd.

== Description ==
===Appearance===
The Pyrenean Sheepdog is a small to medium-sized breed (it is the smallest French herding breed) that resembles as small Berger Picard; they usually stand between ; the breed standards state the long-haired dogs are and bitches whilst smooth-faced dogs are and bitches . The breed weighs between . The breed has a lean, athletic build which gives them both speed and endurance as is typical of smaller herding dogs; the varieties are anatomically almost identical, although the smooth-faced variety is described as being slightly shorter in the body and having more compact feet. The breed is considered very hardy and its build gives it impressive stamina, particularly so given the altitudes it works in, it easily covers over in a day.

The Pyrenean Sheepdog&#x27;s coat can be medium (known as goat-haired) or long, the long-haired varieties have longer hair on the face whilst the smooth-faced variety has much shorter hair on its face. The breed&#x27;s coat provides excellent protection from extreme weather, particularly the long-haired variety, the variations seen in the breed&#x27;s coats is an indication that the breed is primarily bred for working ability and not appearance. The breed can be fawn, grey, blue, brindle or black in colour which can be overlaid with black and also can have some white on the chest and limbs.

Traditionally the Pyrenean Sheepdog&#x27;s ears and tail were docked although this custom is no longer common due to the procedures being restricted/ banned in numerous countries.

===Temperament===
The Pyrenean Sheepdog is an extremely active breed, sometimes described as a &#x27;ball of fire&#x27;, it is very intelligent and quick-witted, mischievous, has quick reactions and abundant nervous energy; like many breeds of sheepdogs the breed is rather wary of strangers although the smooth-faced variety is said to be less so.

<doc id="514715" wikidata="Q4434499" url="?curid=514715" title="List of Gulag camps">
<text>The list below, enumerates the selected sites of the Soviet forced labor camps of the Gulag, known in Russian as the &quot;corrective labor camps&quot;, abbreviation: ITL. Most of them served mining, construction, and timber works. It is estimated that for most of its existence, the Gulag system consisted of over 30,000 camps, divided into three categories according to the number of prisoners held. The largest camps consisted of more than 25,000 prisoners each, medium size camps held from 5,000 to 25,000 inmates, and the smallest, but most numerous labor camps operated with less than 5,000 people each. Even this incomplete list can give a fair idea of the scale of forced labor in the USSR.

A list of Gulag penal labor camps in the USSR was created in Poland from the personal accounts of labor camp detainees of Polish citizenship. It was compiled by the government of Poland for the purpose of regulation and future financial compensation for World War II victims, and published in a decree of the Council of Ministers of Poland.

==Camp system operation==
There were a number of particular categories of convicts that were imprisoned there including:
#Any person convicted to a term of imprisonment of more than three years (all those convicted to less than three years were to be sent to &quot;corrective labor colonies&quot;).
#Opponents of the Soviet rule. Initially these were dubbed &quot;class enemies&quot; (White Army combatants, members of opposition parties, nobility, etc.). Later, when the full victory of the Revolution was declared and there were supposedly no more &quot;class enemies&quot; left, a more flexible term of the enemy of the people was introduced, as well as an infamous Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code) that covered &quot;counter-revolutionary activities&quot;.
#Soviet combatants returned from captivity. As a rule they were held liable under Article 58.

The prisoners of war were generally imprisoned in special POW camps, which existed independently from the network of corrective labor camps, and were subordinated to a separate administrative apparatus within the NKVD (since 1946: MVD) called GUPVI. However, a fair number of POWs ended up in the regular camp system eventually. Unlike Gulag camps, located primarily in remote areas (mostly in Siberia), most of the POW camps after the war were located in the European part of the Soviet Union (with notable exceptions of the Japanese POW in the Soviet Union), where the prisoners worked on restoration of the country&#x27;s infrastructure destroyed during the war: roads, railways, plants, etc., see POW labor in the Soviet Union. Polish citizens and members of other nationalities who were imprisoned at the Soviet forced labour camps during World War II worked also for the Soviet Army, digging trenches, employed in lumber and cement works, airport runway construction, and unloading of transport goods.

<text>The Home Fleet was a fleet of the Royal Navy that operated from the United Kingdom&#x27;s territorial waters from 1902 with intervals until 1967. In 1967, it was merged with the Mediterranean Fleet creating the new Western Fleet.

Before the First World War between 1902 and 1904 the Admiralty reorganised its ships in home waters into a permanent force called the Home Squadron. At the beginning of 1905, it was renamed the Channel Fleet. In 1907 a new Home Fleet was formed from ships in reserve and new ships, and in 1909 the Channel Fleet was merged into it, forming the principal fleet in British waters. In 1912 it was renamed the Home Fleets, formed of the First, Second and Third. On the outbreak of the First World War the First Fleet became the Grand Fleet. When the Grand Fleet was redistributed after the war, the reserve fleet was briefly named Home Fleet in 1919 before being renamed, and after the Invergordon Mutiny in 1931 the Atlantic Fleet was renamed Home Fleet in 1932. During the Second World War, it was the Royal Navy&#x27;s main battle force in European waters.

==Pre-First World War==
In the first years of the 20th century, the Royal Navy had four &#x27;Port Guard&#x27; ships, stationed in the major naval bases, partially to act as flagships for the admirals commanding at those ports. These vessels appear to have been stationed at the Nore, Portsmouth, and Plymouth, as well as one other major base.

On 1 October 1902, the Admiral Superintendent Naval Reserves, then Vice-Admiral Gerard Noel, was given the additional appointment of Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, and allotted a rear-admiral to serve under him as commander of the Home Squadron. &quot;... the nucleus of the Home Fleet would consist of the four Port Guard ships, which would be withdrawn from their various scattered dockyards and turned into a unified and permanent sea-going command – the Home Squadron – based on Portland. Also under the direction of the commander-in-chief of the Home Fleet would be the Coast Guard ships, which would continue to be berthed for the most part in their respective district harbours in order to carry out their local duties, but would join the Home Squadron for sea work at least three times per year, at which point the assembled force – the Home Squadron and the Coast Guard vessels – would be known collectively as the Home Fleet.&quot; Rear-Admiral George Atkinson-Willes was Second-in-Command of the Home Fleet, with his flag in the battleship HMS &quot;Empress of India&quot;, at this time. In May 1903 Noel was succeeded as Commander-in-Chief by Vice-Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson.

On 14 December 1904, the Channel Fleet was re-styled the Atlantic Fleet and the Home Fleet became the Channel Fleet. In 1907, the Home Fleet was reformed with Vice-Admiral Francis Bridgeman in command, succeeded by Admiral Sir William May in 1909. Bridgeman took command again in 1911, and in the same year was succeeded by Admiral Sir George Callaghan. On 29 March 1912, a new structure of the fleet was announced, which came into force on 1 May 1912. The former Home Fleet, which was organised into four divisions, was divided into the First, Second and Third Fleets as Home Fleets. The Home Fleets were the Navy&#x27;s unified home commands in British waters from 1912 to 1914. On 4 August 1914, as the First World War was breaking out, John Jellicoe was ordered to take command of the Fleet, which by his appointment order was renamed the Grand Fleet.

==Three Home Fleets, 1912–1914==
The Home Fleets were a new organisation of the Royal Navy&#x27;s unified home commands (First, Second and Third Fleets) instituted on 31 July 1912 to December 1914.

===Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleets===
On 8 August 1914 units of the Home Fleets were distributed in accordance with Admiralty Fleet Order the majority of elements formed the new Grand Fleet others were assigned to the following units: Channel Fleet, Northern Patrol-Cruiser Force B, 7th Cruiser Squadron-Cruiser Force, 11th Cruiser Squadron-Cruiser Force E, Dover Patrol, Harwich Flotillas, 7th Destroyer Flotilla, 8th Destroyer Flotilla, 9th Destroyer Flotilla, 5th Submarine Flotilla, 6th Submarine Flotilla, 7th Submarine Flotilla and the 8th Submarine Flotilla.

==Inter-war period==
When the Grand Fleet was disbanded in April 1919, the more powerful ships were grouped into the Atlantic Fleet and the older ships became the &quot;Home Fleet&quot;; this arrangement lasted until late 1919, when the ships of the Home Fleet became the Reserve Fleet.

The name &quot;Home Fleet&quot; was resurrected in March 1932, as the new name for the Atlantic Fleet, following the Invergordon Mutiny. The Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet in 1933 was Admiral Sir John Kelly. The Home Fleet comprised the flagship leading a force that included the 2nd Battle Squadron (five more battleships), the Battlecruiser Squadron ( and ), the 2nd Cruiser Squadron (Vice-Admiral Edward Astley-Rushton) aboard (three cruisers), three destroyer flotillas (27), a submarine flotilla (six), two aircraft carriers and associated vessels.

===History===

The Home Fleet was the Royal Navy&#x27;s main battle force in European waters during the Second World War. On 3 September 1939, under Admiral Forbes flying his flag in at Scapa Flow, it consisted of the 2nd Battle Squadron, the Battle Cruiser Squadron, 18th Cruiser Squadron, Rear-Admiral, Destroyers, Rear-Admiral, Submarines (2nd Submarine Flotilla, Dundee, 6th Submarine Flotilla, Blyth, Northumberland), Vice-Admiral, Aircraft Carriers (Vice-Admiral L. V. Wells, with , , and &quot;Pegasus&quot;), and the Orkney and Shetlands force. Its chief responsibility was to keep Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; from breaking out of the North Sea. For this purpose, the First World War base at Scapa Flow was reactivated as it was well placed for interceptions of ships trying to run the blockade.
The two most surprising losses of the Home Fleet during the early part of the war were the sinking of the old battleship by the German submarine while supposedly safe in Scapa Flow, and the loss of the pride of the Navy, the battlecruiser , to the German battleship . 2nd Battle Squadron under Admiral Blagrove was effectively disestablished when he died in the sinking of &quot;Royal Oak&quot;.

The operational areas of the Home Fleet were not circumscribed, and units were detached to other zones quite freely. However, the southern parts of the North Sea and the English Channel were made separate commands for light forces, and the growing intensity of the Battle of the Atlantic led to the creation of Western Approaches Command. Only with the destruction of the German battleship in 1944 did the Home Fleet assume a lower priority, and most of its heavy units were withdrawn to be sent to the Far East.

As the Cold War began, greater emphasis was placed on protecting the North Atlantic sea lanes from the Soviet Union in concert with other Western countries. Admiral Sir Rhoderick McGrigor supervised combined Western Union exercises involving ships from the British, French, and Dutch navies in June–July 1949. Admiral McGrigor flew his flag from the aircraft carrier . Also taking part in the exercises were and , along with cruisers and destroyers. During the exercise, the combined force paid a visit to Mount&#x27;s Bay in Cornwall from 30 June – 4 July 1949.

Admiral Sir Philip Vian, Commander-in-Chief from 1950 to 1952, flew his flag in . In late 1951, joined the fleet as flagship of the 3rd Aircraft Carrier Squadron.

From 1947 to 1957 superfluous battleships and aircraft carriers were assigned to the Training Squadron, Home Fleet headquartered at Portland to provide basic training. The carriers stationed here were mobilised as helicopter carriers for the Suez operation in 1956. In December 1951 the Admiralty authorised the creation of a new Heavy Squadron to be assigned to the Home Fleet, consisting of the battleship &quot;Vanguard&quot;, aircraft carriers, and cruisers. Its commanding officer was known as Flag Officer, Aircraft Carriers who had administrative responsibility for all the operational carriers; the squadron was disbanded in October 1954.

After the Second World War, the Royal Navy&#x27;s geographic commands were gradually merged into fewer but larger formations (1954 to 1971). After 1951 the term flotilla applied to the higher command organisation of squadrons in the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. The squadrons of the Home Fleet were grouped under a Flag Officer, Flotillas, Home Fleet, who became the main seagoing flag officer. A similar arrangement applied to the Flag Officer, Flotillas, Mediterranean Fleet. In the Far East the Flag Officer 5th Cruiser Squadron became Flag Officer Second in Command Far East Fleet with similar seagoing duties. Increasingly the term &#x27;Submarine Flotilla&#x27; was used to describe the squadrons under command of the Flag Officer Submarines.

The Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, gained an additional NATO responsibility as Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Atlantic (CINCEASTLANT), as part of Allied Command Atlantic, when the NATO military command structure was established in 1953. CINCEASTLANT was set up at the Northwood Headquarters in northwest London. The Commander-in-Chief Home Fleet still flew his flag however in at Portsmouth. During Exercise Mainbrace in 1952, NATO naval forces came together for the first time to practice the defence of northern Europe, Denmark and Norway. The resulting McMahon Act difficulties caused by potential British control of the United States Navy&#x27;s attack carriers armed with nuclear weapons led to the creation of a separate Striking Fleet Atlantic, directly responsible to the commander of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Atlantic Fleet, in his NATO position as SACLANT, by the end of 1952. The submarine tender was the fleet&#x27;s flagship in 1956.

In the spring of 1960, C-in-C Home Fleet moved permanently ashore to Northwood, while Flag Officer, Flotillas, Home, retained effective control at sea as the C-in-C&#x27;s deputy. Cecil Hampshire writes that the ships with the fleet in 1960 included the flagship &quot;Tyne,&quot; a destroyer depot ship which by then was more than 20 years old; carriers Victorious and ; fast minelayer Apollo; seventeen destroyers and frigates; and sixteen submarines. Another aircraft carrier, cruisers Lion and Blake; the first four guided missile destroyers, and other ships were under construction.

In February 1963 all remaining frigate and destroyer squadrons in the Home, Mediterranean and Far East Fleets were merged into new Escort Squadrons. In April 1963, the naval unit at the Northwood Headquarters, in northwest London, was commissioned as under the command of the then Captain of the Fleet.

From 1966 to 1967, then-Rear Admiral Sir Michael Pollock was listed as Flag Officer Second in Command, Home Fleet.
In December 1966, all remaining squadrons in the Home Fleet were disbanded. In 1967 the Home Fleet was amalgamated with the Mediterranean Fleet and redesignated the Western Fleet.

<text>From 1933 to 1945, Nazi Germany operated more than a thousand [[concentration camps]] (), including subcamps on its own territory and in parts of German-occupied Europe.

The first camps were established in March 1933 immediately after Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany. Following the 1934 purge of the SA, the concentration camps were run exclusively by the SS via the Concentration Camps Inspectorate and later the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office. Initially, most prisoners were members of the Communist Party of Germany, but as time went on different groups were arrested, including &quot;habitual criminals&quot;, &quot;asocials&quot;, and Jews. After the beginning of World War II, people from German-occupied Europe were imprisoned in the concentration camps. About 1.65 million people were registered prisoners in the camps, of whom about a million died during their imprisonment. Most of the fatalities occurred during the second half of World War II, including at least a third of the 700,000 prisoners who were registered as of January 1945. Following Allied military victories, the camps were gradually liberated in 1944 and 1945, although hundreds of thousands of prisoners died in the death marches. 

Museums commemorating the victims of the Nazi regime have been established at many of the former camps and the Nazi concentration camp system has become a universal symbol of violence and terror.

==Background==
Concentration camps are conventionally held to have been invented by the British during the Second Boer War, but historian Dan Stone argues that there were precedents in other countries and that camps were &quot;the logical extension of phenomena that had long characterized colonial rule&quot;. Although the word &quot;concentration camp&quot; has acquired the connotation of murder because of the Nazi concentration camps, the British camps in South Africa did not involve systematic murder. The German Empire also established concentration camps during the Herero and Namaqua genocide (1904–1907); the death rate of these camps was 45 per cent, twice that of the British camps. 

During the First World War, eight to nine million prisoners of war were held in prisoner-of-war camps, some of them at locations which were later the sites of Nazi camps, such as Theresienstadt and Mauthausen. Many prisoners held by Germany died as a result of intentional withholding of food and dangerous working conditions in violation of the 1907 Hague Convention. In countries such as France, Belgium, Italy, Austria-Hungary, and Germany, civilians deemed to be of &quot;enemy origin&quot; were denaturalized. Hundreds of thousands were interned and subject to forced labor in harsh conditions. During the Armenian genocide perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire, Ottoman Armenians were held in camps during their deportation into the Syrian Desert. In postwar Germany, &quot;unwanted foreigners&quot; – mainly Eastern European Jews – were confined at Cottbus-Sielow and Stargard.

==History==
===Early camps (1933–1934)===
On 30 January 1933, Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany after striking a backroom deal with the previous chancellor, Franz von Papen. The Nazis had no plan for concentration camps prior to their seizure of power. The concentration camp system arose in the following months due to the desire to suppress tens of thousands of Nazi opponents in Germany. The Reichstag fire in February 1933 was the pretext for mass arrests. The Reichstag Fire Decree eliminated the right to personal freedom enshrined in the Weimar Constitution and provided a legal basis for detention without trial. The first camp was Nohra, established on 3 March 1933 in a school.

The number of prisoners in 1933–1934 is difficult to determine; historian Jane Caplan estimated it at 50,000, with arrests perhaps exceeding 100,000. Eighty per cent of prisoners were members of the Communist Party of Germany and ten per cent members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. Many prisoners were released in late 1933, and after a Christmas amnesty, there were only a few dozen camps left. About 70 camps were established in 1933, in any convenient structure that could hold prisoners, including vacant factories, prisons, country estates, schools, workhouses, and castles. There was no national system; camps were operated by local police, SS, and SA, state interior ministries, or a combination of the above. The early camps in 1933–1934 were heterogeneous and fundamentally differed from the post-1935 camps in organization, conditions, and the groups imprisoned. 

===Institutionalization (1934–1937)===

On 26 June 1933, Himmler appointed Theodor Eicke the second commandant of Dachau, which became the model followed by other camps. Eicke drafted the Disciplinary and Penal Code, a manual which specified draconian punishments for disobedient prisoners. He also created a system of prisoner functionaries, which later developed into the camp elders, block elders, and kapo of later camps. In May 1934, Lichtenburg was taken over by the SS from the Prussian bureaucracy, marking the beginning of a transition set in motion by Heinrich Himmler, then chief of the Gestapo (secret police). Following the purge of the SA on 30 June 1934, in which Eicke took a leading role, the remaining SA-run camps were taken over by the SS. In December 1934, Eicke was appointed the first inspector of the Concentration Camps Inspectorate (IKL); only camps managed by the IKL were designated &quot;concentration camps&quot;. 
In early 1934, the number of prisoners was still falling and it was uncertain if the system would continue to exist. By mid-1935, there were only five camps, holding 4,000 prisoners, and 13 employees at the central IKL office. At the same time, 100,000 people were imprisoned in German jails, a quarter of those for political offenses. Believing Nazi Germany to be imperiled by internal enemies, Himmler called for a war against the &quot;organized elements of sub-humanity&quot;, including communists, socialists, Jews, Freemasons, and criminals. Himmler won Hitler&#x27;s backing and was appointed Chief of German Police on 17 June 1936. Of the six SS camps operational as of mid-1936, only two (Dachau and Lichtenburg) still existed by 1938. In the place of the camps that closed down, Eicke opened new camps at Sachsenhausen (September 1936) and Buchenwald (July 1937). Unlike earlier camps, the newly opened camps were purpose-built, isolated from the population and the rule of law, enabling the SS to exert absolute power. Prisoners, who previously wore civilian clothes, were forced to wear uniforms with Nazi concentration camp badges. The number of prisoners began to rise again, from 4,761 on 1 November 1936 to 7,750 by the end of 1937.

===Rapid expansion (1937–1939)===

By the end of June 1938, the prisoner population had expanded threefold in the previous six months, to 24,000 prisoners. The increase was fueled by arrests of those considered habitual criminals or asocials. According to &quot;SS&quot; chief Heinrich Himmler, the &quot;criminal&quot; prisoners at concentration camps needed to be isolated from society because they had committed offenses of a sexual or violent nature. In fact, most of the criminal prisoners were working-class men who had resorted to petty theft to support their families. Nazi raids of perceived asocials, including the arrest of 10,000 people in June 1938, targeted homeless people and the mentally ill, as well as the unemployed. Although the Nazis had previously targeted social outsiders, the influx of new prisoners meant that political prisoners became a minority.

To house the new prisoners, three new camps were established: Flossenbürg (May 1938) near the Czechoslovak border, Mauthausen (August 1938) in territory annexed from Austria, and Ravensbrück (May 1939) the first purpose-built camp for female prisoners. The mass arrests were partly motivated by economic factors. Recovery from the Great Depression lowered the unemployment rate, so &quot;work-shy&quot; elements would be arrested to keep others working harder. At the same time, Himmler was also focusing on exploiting prisoners&#x27; labor within the camp system. Hitler&#x27;s architect, Albert Speer, had grand plans for creating monumental Nazi architecture. The SS company German Earth and Stone Works (DEST) was set up with funds from Speer&#x27;s agency for exploiting prisoner labour to extract building materials. Flossenbürg and Mauthausen had been built adjacent to quarries, and DEST also set up brickworks at Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen.

Political prisoners were also arrested in larger numbers, including Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and German émigrés who returned home. Czech and Austrian anti-Nazis were arrested after the annexation of their countries in 1938 and 1939. Jews were also increasingly targeted, with 2,000 Viennese Jews arrested after the Nazi annexation. After the Kristallnacht pogrom in November 1938, 26,000 Jewish men were deported to concentration camps following mass arrests, overwhelming the capacity of the system. These prisoners were subject to unprecedented abuse leading to hundreds of deaths – more people died at Dachau in the four months after Kristallnacht than in the previous five years. Most of the Jewish prisoners were soon released, often after promising to emigrate.

===World War II===
At the end of August 1939, prisoners of Flossenbürg, Sachsenhausen, and other concentration camps were murdered as part of false flag attacks staged by Germany to justify the invasion of Poland. During the war, the camps became increasingly brutal and lethal due to the plans of the Nazi leadership: most victims died in the second half of the war. Five new camps were opened between the start of the war and the end of 1941: Neuengamme (early 1940), outside of Hamburg; Auschwitz (June 1940), which initially operated as a concentration camp for Polish resistance activists; Gross-Rosen (May 1941) in Silesia; and Natzweiler (May 1941) in territory annexed from France. The first satellite camps were also established, administratively subordinated to one of the main camps. The number of prisoners tripled from 21,000 in August 1939 to about 70,000 to 80,000 in early 1942. This expansion was driven by the demand for forced labor and later the invasion of the Soviet Union; new camps were sent up near quarries (Natzweiler and Gross-Rosen) or brickworks (Neuengamme).
In April 1941, the high command of the SS ordered the murder of ill and exhausted prisoners who could no longer work (especially those deemed racially inferior). Victims were selected by camp personnel or traveling doctors, and were removed from the camps to be murdered in euthanasia centers. By April 1942, when the operation finished, at least 6,000 and as many as 20,000 people had been killed – the first act of systematic killing in the camp system. Beginning in August 1941, selected Soviet prisoners of war were killed within the concentration camps, usually within a few days of their arrival. By mid-1942, when the operation finished, at least 34,000 Soviet prisoners had been murdered. At Auschwitz, the SS used Zyklon B to kill Soviet prisoners in improvised gas chambers.

In 1942, the emphasis of the camps shifted to the war effort; by 1943, two-thirds of prisoners were employed by war industries. The death rate skyrocketed with an estimated half of the 180,000 prisoners admitted between July and November 1942 dying by the end of that interval. Orders to reduce deaths in order to spare inmate productivity had little effect in practice. During the second half of the war, Auschwitz swelled in size – fueled by the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Jews – and became the center of the camp system. It was the deadliest concentration camp and Jews sent there faced a virtual death sentence even if they were not immediately killed, as most were. In August 1943, 74,000 of the 224,000 registered prisoners in all SS concentration camps were in Auschwitz. In 1943 and early 1944, additional concentration camps – Riga in Latvia, Kovno in Lithuania, Vaivara in Estonia, and Kraków-Plaszów in Poland – were converted from ghettos or labor camps; these camps were populated almost entirely by Jewish prisoners. Along with the new main camps, many satellite camps were set up to more effectively leverage prisoner labor for the war effort.

==Organization==
Beginning in the mid-1930s, the camps were organized according to the following structure: commandant/adjutant, political department, protective custody camp, , camp doctor, and guard command. In November 1940, the IKL came under the control of the SS Main Command Office and the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) took on the responsibility of detaining and releasing concentration camp prisoners. In 1942, the IKL was subordinated to the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office (SS-WVHA) to improve the camps&#x27; integration into the war economy. Despite changes in the structure, the IKL remained directly responsible to Himmler.

The camps under the IKL were guarded by members of the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbande&quot; (&quot;death&#x27;s head&quot;). The guards were housed in barracks adjacent to the camp and their duties were to guard the perimeter of the camp as well as work details. They were officially forbidden from entering the camps, although this rule was not followed. Towards the end of the 1930s, the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbande&quot; expanded its operations and set up military units, which followed the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; death squads and massacred Polish Jews as well as Soviet prisoners of war. Older general SS personnel, and those wounded or disabled, replaced those assigned to combat duties. As the war progressed, a more diverse group was recruited to guard the expanding camp system, including female guards (who were not part of the SS). During the second half of the war, army and air force personnel were recruited, making up as many as 52 per cent of guards by January 1945. The manpower shortage was reduced by relying on guard dogs and delegating some duties to prisoners. Corruption was widespread.

Most of the camp SS leadership was middle-class and came from the , who were hard-hit by the economic crisis and feared decline in status. Most had joined the Nazi movement by September 1931 and were offered full-time employment in 1933. SS leaders typically lived with their wives and children near the camps where they worked, often engaging prisoners for domestic labor. Perpetration by this leadership was based on their tight social bonds, a perceived common sense that the aims of the system were good, as well as the opportunity for material gain.

==Prisoners==
Before World War II, most prisoners in the concentration camps were Germans. After the expansion of Nazi Germany, people from countries occupied by the Wehrmacht were targeted and detained in concentration camps. In Western Europe, arrests focused on resistance fighters and saboteurs, but in Eastern Europe arrests included mass roundups aimed at the implementation of Nazi population policy and the forced recruitment of workers. This led to a predominance of Eastern Europeans, especially Poles, who made up the majority of the population of some camps. By the end of the war, only 5 to 10 per cent of the camp population was &quot;Reich Germans&quot; from Germany or Austria. More than 100,000 Soviet prisoners of war and smaller groups from other nationalities were transferred to the concentration camps in direct violation of the Geneva Convention.

Most Jews who were persecuted and killed during the Holocaust were never prisoners in concentration camps. Significant numbers of Jews were imprisoned beginning in November 1938 because of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, after which they were always overrepresented as prisoners. During the height of the Holocaust from 1941 to 1943, the Jewish population of the concentration camps was low. Extermination camps for the mass murder of Jews—Kulmhof, Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka—were set up outside the concentration camp system. The existing IKL camps Auschwitz and Majdanek gained additional function as extermination camps. After mid-1943, some forced-labor camps for Jews and some Nazi ghettos were converted into concentration camps. Other Jews entered the concentration camp system after being deported to Auschwitz. Despite many deaths, as many as 200,000 Jews survived the war inside the camp system. 

==Conditions==

Conditions worsened after the outbreak of war due to reduction in food, worsening housing, and increase in work. Deaths from disease and malnutrition increased, outpacing other causes of death. However, the food provided was usually sufficient to sustain life. Life in the camps has often been depicted as a Darwinian struggle for survival, although some mutual aid existed. Individual efforts to survive, sometimes at others&#x27; expense, could hamper the aggregate survival rate.

The influx of non-German prisoners from 1939 changed the previous hierarchy based on triangle to one based on nationality. Jews, Slavic prisoners, and Spanish Republicans were targeted for especially harsh treatment which led to a high mortality rate during the first half of the war. In contrast, Reich Germans enjoyed favorable treatment compared to other nationalities. 

A minority of prisoners obtained substantially better treatment than the rest because they were prisoner functionaries (mostly Germans) or skilled laborers. Prisoner functionaries served at the whim of the SS and could be dismissed for insufficient strictness. As a result, sociologist Wolfgang Sofsky emphasizes that &quot;They took over the role of the SS in order to prevent SS encroachment&quot; and other prisoners remembered them for their brutality. 

==Forced labor==
Hard labor was a fundamental component of the concentration camp system and an aspect in the daily life of prisoners. However, the forced labor deployment was largely determined by external political and economic factors that drove demand for labor. During the first years of the camps, unemployment was high and prisoners were forced to perform economically valueless but strenuous tasks, such as farming on moorland (such as at Esterwegen). Other prisoners had to work on constructing and expanding the camps. In the years before World War II, quarrying and bricklaying for the SS company DEST played a central role in prisoner labor. Despite prisoners&#x27; increasing economic importance, conditions declined; prisoners were seen as expendable so each influx of prisoners was followed by increasing death rate.

Private sector cooperation remained marginal to the overall concentration camp system for the first half of the war. After the failure to take Moscow in late 1941, the demand for armaments increased. The WVHA sought out partnerships with private industry and Speer&#x27;s Armaments Ministry. In September 1942, Himmler and Speer agreed to use prisoners in armaments production and to repair damage from Allied bombing. Local authorities and private companies could hire prisoners at a fixed daily cost. This decision paved the way for the establishment of many subcamps located near workplaces. More workers were obtained through transfers from prisons and forced labor programs, causing the prisoner population to double twice by mid-1944. Subcamps where prisoners did construction work had significantly higher death rates than those that worked in munitions manufacture. By the end of the war, main camps were functioning more and more as transfer stations from which prisoners were redirected to subcamps.

At their peak in 1945, concentration camp prisoners made up 3 per cent of workers in Germany. Historian Marc Buggeln estimates that no more than 1 per cent of the labor for Germany&#x27;s arms production came from concentration camp prisoners. 

==Public perception==
Arrests of Germans in 1933 were often accompanied by public humiliation or beatings. If released, prisoners might return home with visible marks of abuse or psychological breakdown. Using a &quot;dual strategy of publicity and secrecy&quot;, the regime directed terror both at the direct victim as well as the entire society in order to eliminate its opponents and deter resistance. Beginning in March 1933, detailed reports on camp conditions were published in the press. Nazi propaganda demonized the prisoners as race traitors, sexual degenerates, and criminals and presented the camps as sites of re-education. After 1933, reports in the press were scarce but larger numbers of people were arrested and people who interacted with the camps, such as those who registered deaths, could make conclusions about the camp conditions and discuss with acquaintances. 

The visibility of the camps heightened during the war due to increasing prisoner numbers, the establishment of many subcamps in proximity to German civilians, and the use of labor deployments outside the camps. These subcamps, often established in town centers in such locations as schools, restaurants, barracks, factory buildings, or military camps, were joint ventures between industry and the SS. An increasing number of German civilians interacted with the camps: entrepreneurs and landowners provided land or services, doctors decided which prisoners were healthy enough to continue working, foremen oversaw labor deployments, and administrators helped with logistics. SS construction brigades were in demand by municipalities to clear bomb debris and rebuild. For the prisoners, chances of survival rarely improved despite the contact with the outside world, although those few Germans who tried to help did not encounter punishment. Germans were often shocked to see the reality of the concentration camps up close, but reluctant to aid the prisoners because of fear that they would be imprisoned as well. Others found the poor state of the prisoners to confirm Nazi propaganda about them.

Historian Robert Gellately argues that &quot;the Germans generally turned out to be proud and pleased that Hitler and his henchmen were putting away certain kinds of people who did not fit in, or who were regarded as &#x27;outsiders&#x27;, &#x27;asocials&#x27;, &#x27;useless eaters&#x27;, or &#x27;criminals. According to historian Karola Fings, fear of arrest did not undermine public support for the camps because Germans saw the prisoners rather than the guards as criminals. She writes that demand for SS construction brigades &quot;points to general acceptance of the concentration camps&quot;. In Cologne some construction brigade prisoners were shot in broad daylight.

==Statistics==

There were 27 main camps and, according to historian Nikolaus Wachsmann&#x27;s estimate, more than 1,100 satellite camps. This is a cumulative figure that counts all the subcamps that existed at one point; historian Karin Orth estimates the number of subcamps to have been 186 at the end of 1943, 341 or more in June 1944, and at least 662 in January 1945.

The camps were concentrated in prewar Germany and to a lesser extent territory annexed to Germany. No camps were built on the territory of Germany&#x27;s allies that enjoyed even nominal independence. Each camp housed either men, women, or a mixed population. Women&#x27;s camps were mostly for armaments production and located primarily in northern Germany, Thuringia, or the Sudetenland, while men&#x27;s camps had a wider geographical distribution. Sex segregation decreased over the course of the war and mixed camps predominated outside of Germany&#x27;s prewar borders.

About 1.65 million people were registered prisoners in the camps, of whom, according to Wagner, nearly a million died during their imprisonment. Historian Adam Tooze counts the number of survivors at no more than 475,000, calculating that at least 1.1 million of the registered prisoners must have died. According to his estimate, at least 800,000 of the murdered prisoners were not Jewish. In addition to the registered prisoners who died, a million Jews were gassed upon arriving in Auschwitz; including these victims, the total death toll is estimated at 1.8 to more than two million. Most of the fatalities occurred during the second half of World War II, including at least a third of the 700,000 prisoners who were registered as of January 1945.

==Death marches and liberation==


Major evacuations of the camps occurred in mid-1944 from the Baltics and eastern Poland, January 1945 from western Poland and Silesia, and in March 1945 from concentration camps in Germany. Both Jewish and non-Jewish prisoners died in large numbers as a consequence of these death marches.

Many prisoners died after liberation due to their poor physical condition.

The liberation of the camps – documented by the Western Allies in 1945 – has played a prominent part in perception of the camp system as a whole.

==Legacy==
Since their liberation, the Nazi concentration camp system has come to symbolize violence and terror in the modern world.
After the war, most Germans rejected the crimes associated with the concentration camps, while denying any knowledge or responsibility. Under the West German policy of (), some survivors of concentration camps received compensation for their imprisonment. A few perpetrators were put on trial after the war.

Accounts of the concentration camps – both condemnatory and sympathetic – were publicized outside of Germany before World War II. Many survivors testified about their experiences or wrote memoirs after the war. Some of these accounts have become internationally famous, such as Primo Levi&#x27;s 1947 book, &quot;If This is a Man&quot;. The concentration camps have been the subject of historical writings since Eugen Kogon&#x27;s 1946 study, &quot;&quot; (&quot;The SS State&quot;). Substantial research did not begin until the 1980s. Scholarship has focused on the fate of groups of prisoners, the organization of the camp system, and aspects such as forced labor. As late as the 1990s, German local and economic history omitted mention of the camps or presented them as exclusively the responsibility of the SS. Two scholarly encyclopedias of the concentration camps have been published: Der Ort des Terrors and Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos. According to Caplan and Wachsmann, &quot;more books have been published on the Nazi camps than any other site of detention and terror in history&quot;.

Stone argues that the Nazi concentration camp system inspired similar atrocities by other regimes, including the Argentine military junta during the Dirty War, the Pinochet regime in Chile, the Brazilian military dictatorship and Pitești Prison in the Romanian People&#x27;s Republic.

<text>Dial on Demand Routing (DDR) is a routing technique where a network connection to a remote site is established only when needed. In other words, if the router tries to send out data and the connection is off, then the router will automatically establish a connection, send the information, and close the connection when no more data needs to be sent. DDR is advantageous for companies that must pay per minute for a WAN setup, where a connection is always established. Constant connections can become needlessly expensive if the company does not require a constant internet connection.

==How it works==

There are two parts to establishing a connection with DDR: the physical connection and the digital connection. The physical connection consists of the actual cable that connects computers on the network and the network interface card that allows for communication over these cables. DDR uses existing Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) lines – or the network of all public circuit-switched telephone networks - to form a connection between the sender and receiver.

The second part of establishing a DDR connection consists of establishing the digital signal. This requires one to determine the protocols to be used over the logical connection. DDR uses a Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) link, which handles all networking functions such as sending, receiving and compressing the signals between two computers on the internet. In other words, the PPP link uses telephone lines to send signals between you and the computer containing your desired website when you wish to make a connection to the internet.

DDR can be used both as a primary and as a backup connection. Today, DDR is mainly used for backup connections which go live when the primary connection fails. DDR connections are inherently slow and service fees are charged like phone calls depending on the uptime. DDR can be used with modems or Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) connections, which allow it to achieve a maximum connection speed of only 1.544 Mbit/s in the US and 2.048 Mbit/s in Europe and Australia.

==Design considerations==

One important factor to be minimized is the connection establishment delay. This is the time from when the user first attempts to make a connection to when the receiving computer begins to receive information. This delay can range from 3 to over 20 seconds depending on various factors. These include but are not limited to the type of physical cable used in the connection, the distance the data is being sent, and the protocols used to send the information. Knowing the extent of the delay is a very important part of designing an efficient DDR system. If the delay when attempting to establish a connection is too great, the application will abandon the connection attempt and try again.

==Why DDR is still used today==

Despite its drawbacks, there are two important reasons why Dial-on-Demand routing is used today: reliability and cost. These two factors become exceedingly important when a company has multiple locations that need to communicate with one another on a regular basis.

If a company or organization communicates between its different branches or firms regularly, it will most likely lease a dedicated cable line to connect each of the branches together. These lines are not always reliable meaning one branch may be cut off from the rest. In situations like this, having a backup connection ready is essential. Since DDR uses existing telephone lines, a DDR connection will almost always be available as a backup solution.

A second reason why DDR is still used is because it’s cheap. Leasing cable lines can be needlessly expensive if information isn’t constantly being sent back and forth between branches. This makes DDR very cost effective.

==Defining connection access==

DDR is commonly configured as a hub and spoke network, where remote sites dial a central site to exchange data. Depending on the needs, the central site can also be the one to contact the remote sites to retrieve data. Calls are initiated on a per need basis and are shut down once the transmission is terminated. 
Access Control Lists (ACLs) can be used to restrict which type of traffic is allowed to establish a connection. ACLs can be refined so that the interface is brought up only when the connection established matches a specific set of criteria. These specific criteria are essential to minimizing connections which would otherwise be initiated needlessly, thereby minimizing cost.

When using dynamic routing protocols to discover remote networks, it is crucial to configure interesting traffic accordingly; otherwise the connection will be initiated on every dynamic routing update. Depending on the protocol being used this could occur as often as once every 60 seconds. Additionally, it is equally crucial to filter out any native Ethernet traffic which would otherwise cause an unwanted connection to initialize.

ACLs can also restrict the establishment of a link depending on the destination host being contacted and the host trying to establish the connection. For example, if only certain users are to be allowed to establish connections, but all users should have intranet access, then ACLs can be configured so that only the computers of the select users are allowed access.

Furthermore, ACLs can be configured so that only connections to a specific destination will be initialized. For example, if a hypothetical user Alice wants to connect to a Destination X and a hypothetical User Bob wants to connect to Destination Y, but traffic to destination X is not considered interesting, then only Bob would be able to establish a WAN connection.

Interesting traffic can also be defined such that only SSH packets are allowed to establish the link. In that case, then all other packets trying to access valid destinations will be discarded. When configuring dynamic routing protocols to communicate over a DDR connection, their update packets must be classified as interesting traffic. Depending on the dynamic routing protocol being used, setting their updates as interesting traffic might cause the connection to be initialized often.

For example, RIP v1, which updates every 30 seconds, would cause the connection to be initialized on every update. It is common to see static routes defined for these connections in order to avoid extra service charges. Other routing protocols such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) only send updates when a connection changes. These routing protocols are ideal for DDR and must be configured with &quot;default-information originate&quot; on a Cisco router.

==Dialer maps and rotary groups==

Dialer maps are configured on each interface to specify which numbers to dial and how long to stay on the line waiting for the receiving end to pick up. For example, if two dialer map commands on the Serial Interface 0/0/0 (Serial port 0 of module 0 of interface 0) have the same next hop address, or the IP address of the connection at the destination end, but with different phone numbers, then the first number is dialed and only once the wait-for-carrier timer expires will the next number be dialed. The wait-for-carrier timer can be specified when configuring the dialer map.

Backup interfaces can also be defined in the event that all of the numbers on a dialer map for that interface were unreachable. A single interface can be configured for multiple remote sites because no two connections to one interface can be on at the same time. The first step in specifying a DDR interface is defining a rotary group. Although the DDR interface is a virtual one, all of the configuration commands for physical interfaces are available. A dialer Rotary Group can be created so that either of the interfaces in it can be used to dial any of the destinations defined in it.

<doc id="514763" wikidata="Q1125871" url="?curid=514763" title="Bubble Act">
<text>The Bubble Act 1720 (also Royal Exchange and London Assurance Corporation Act 1719) was an act of the Parliament of Great Britain passed on 11 June 1720 that incorporated the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation and London Assurance Corporation, but more significantly forbade the formation of any other joint-stock companies unless approved by royal charter.

Its provisions were extended later by the Bubble Schemes (Colonies) Act 1740 (14 Geo. 2. c. 37) to include its colonies, particularly Massachusetts.

The act gave the South Sea Company a monopoly over British trade with South America until the South Sea Bubble &quot;popped&quot; in Britain&#x27;s first major stock market collapse.

==Background==
Various motivations have been suggested for the act. They include the desire to prevent the speculation that produced the contemporary South Sea Bubble, an attempt to prevent smaller non-charter companies from forming and so reduce the importance of Parliament in regulating businesses; or the South Sea Company itself wanting to prevent other bubbles from forming that might have decreased the intensity of its own.

Recent scholarship indicates that the last was the cause: it was passed to prevent other companies from competing with the South Sea Company for investors&#x27; capital.

In fact, the act was passed in June 1720, before the peak of the bubble. The act was partially repealed in 1825 by the Bubble Companies, etc. Act 1825 (6 Geo. 4. c. 91). The residue of the act was repealed in 1901.

==Contents==
The act declared &quot;illegal and void&quot; all business that raised money or offered shares in the manner of a chartered company without a charter from the royal government. Under the terms of the act, the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation and the London Assurance Corporation were granted charters to write marine insurance. Until 1824, they remained the only joint-stock firms with such a charter.

<doc id="514769" wikidata="Q237886" url="?curid=514769" title="Adela of Normandy">
<text>Adela of Normandy, of Blois, or of England (c. 1067 – 8 March 1137), also known as in the Catholic Church, was a daughter of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders. She later became the countess of Blois, Chartres, and Meaux by marriage to Stephen II of Blois. Her husband greatly benefited from the increased social status and prestige that came with a marriage into such a wealthy and powerful family. She was regent of Blois during the absence of her spouse in 1096–1100 and 1101–02, and during the minority of her son from 1102 until 1120. Her marriage also laid the groundwork for a period of extended strife in the Anglo Norman lands, Adela was the mother of King Stephen of England whose taking of the throne in preference to her niece Empress Matilda led to the civil war known as The Anarchy.

== Early life ==

It is generally believed that Adela was born between 1066 and 1070 after her father&#x27;s accession to the English throne. She was the youngest daughter of William the Conqueror. Her royal blood marked her as noble in the eyes of her peers. She was the favourite sister of King Henry I of England and they were probably the youngest children of the Conqueror. Adela was a high-spirited and educated woman with a knowledge of Latin. As Adela&#x27;s parents both travelled around Normandy, she likely spent much time at and was educated at a monastery, probably the Abbey of Sainte-Trinité, Caen. She had three older brothers and one younger, and thus she would not inherit her father&#x27;s honours; however her bloodline would be a valuable asset in marriage. 

Adela married Stephen Henry, son and heir to the count of Blois, between 1080 and 1083, around her fifteenth birthday. They were married at Chartres Cathedral. This marriage created a strong familial alliance, linking the two most powerful families in Northern France. Stephen was nearly twenty years her senior. During the fifteen years of their marriage, they had six or eight children who survived infancy.

Stephen inherited Blois, Chartres, and Meaux upon his father&#x27;s death in 1089, as well as lands and right in parts of Berry and Burgundy. The Thibaudian dynasty had other possessions east of Paris, and by the end of Adela&#x27;s life these were coalescing into the county of Champagne. While Theobald IV takes most of the credit for the emergence of that principality, Adela helped lay its foundations. Adela and her husband had a relationship based on trust and mutual respect, if not affection, and they made decisions together. She swore, for instance, to bind herself and her husband to protect the bishop of Chartres, then in a dispute with the king of France.

== First regency ==
Stephen-Henry joined the First Crusade in 1096, along with his brother-in-law Robert Curthose. Adela acted as regent for her husband during his extended absence as a leader of the First Crusade (1095–1098) as well as during his second expedition in 1101. Stephen&#x27;s letters to Adela form a uniquely intimate insight into the experiences of the Crusade&#x27;s leaders and show that he trusted Adela to rule as regent while he was on crusade.

Adela&#x27;s regency included granting charters such as the right to build new churches to monks, as well as other charters. Adela also worked with Ivo of Chartres at various points, exchanging letters throughout her regency to discuss matters such as the control of misbehaving nuns and larger issues such as disputes about sworn oaths. While regent, Adela would continue to tour their lands, settling disputes, promoting economic growth, and even commanding knights to go to battle with the king. This role was not unique, however, as during the crusades it was common for noble women to take upon themselves the duties of their male counterparts.

The Count of Blois returned to France in 1100 bringing with him several cartloads of maps, jewels, and other treasures, which he deposited at Chartres. According to Orderic Vitalis, when Stephen-Henry abandoned the First Crusade returning to France in ignominy, &quot;Adela constantly berated him, even during their love-making&quot;, urging him to return to the Holy Land. He was under an obligation to the pope for agreements made years earlier and returned to Antioch to participate in the crusade of 1101. Ultimately, he was killed in a last stand after the Battle of Ramla in 1102. The image of Adela persuading her ease-loving husband to redeem his reputation through action has proved popular with historians attempting to account for the crusader motivations.

== Second regency ==
Adela continued to act as regent after her husband&#x27;s death and through her son Thibaud&#x27;s early rule until her retirement in 1120. Even after Thibaud came of age and no longer needed a regent, Adela continued to issue charters and act as co-ruler of many parts of their land. Adela did not secure a marriage alliance for Thibaud, who did not get married until after Adela&#x27;s retirement, which helped to maintain her power and influence over both her son and her lands.

Adela, a devout Benedictine sympathiser, employed several high-ranking tutors to educate her children. Her youngest son, Henry, was conceived during the single year Stephen was in France between crusading duties. At two years of age Henry was pledged to the Church at Cluny Abbey, Saône-et-Loire, France, as an oblate child, that is, he was dedicated to the service of God, according to medieval practice. Henry went on to be appointed Abbot of Glastonbury and Bishop of Winchester. In that capacity, he sponsored hundreds of constructions including bridges, canals, palaces, forts, castles, and whole villages. In addition, Bishop Henry built dozens of abbeys and chapels and sponsored books including the treasured Winchester Bible.

In 1105, after St Anselm visited her during a sickness, she was responsible for communicating the archbishop&#x27;s earnestness in threatening excommunication to her brother Henry I. Orderic Vitalis praises her as a &quot;wise and spirited woman&quot; who ably governed her husband&#x27;s estates and her own. Adela&#x27;s power and interests are reflected in letters collected, they demonstrate her religiosity and intellect. In one such letter to the public from 1104, Adela gifts a monastery a portion of land with all the wildlife inhabiting it, but she reserves the power to pass judgement upon crimes committed in the area. She also makes sure to mark her place as a woman, tying herself to not only her late husband but her sons.

Adela quarrelled with her eldest son William and despite his previously being named heir-designate, she appointed his younger brother Theobald to replace him as heir in 1107. Another son, Stephen of Blois, moved to London in 1111 to join the court of his uncle, King Henry I (Beauclerc), and became his favourite. Upon Beauclerc&#x27;s death in Normandy (1135), Stephen seized the English throne from Holy Roman Empress Dowager Matilda, King Henry I&#x27;s daughter, whom the monarch had named as his successor. This started a protracted civil war in England that lasted nearly twenty years.

==Retirement==
Adela retired to the monastery at Marcigny, in 1120, where she became a nun. Though she might have considered retiring to a monastery in Normandy where members of her family, including sisters and nieces, may have already been living, Adela was drawn to and chose the larger, more prestigious monastery at Marcigny near her son Henry at Cluny Abbey. Adela might have served as abbess of the community, though this is not certain. She continued to interact and communicate with her children and the ecclesiastical leaders of lands that she had once ruled, maintaining her influence over the region. In one instance, Adela sent letters to both her son Thibaud and Geoffrey, bishop of Chartres, reminding them of her settlement of a monastic case. In these letters she reminds her son how his father and she felt about alms gifting to monasteries.

Later that same year, her daughter Lucia-Mahaut drowned in the wreck of the &quot;White Ship&quot; alongside her husband. Adela lived long enough to see her son Stephen on the English throne, though any response she may have had to this development has been lost. She likely took pride in the ascension of her youngest child, Henry of Blois, to the bishopric of Winchester in 1129. After her death in 1137 at Marcigny, prayers were offered at a number of churches that she had endowed personally or had recognized at some point during her life. Her money, influence, and entry into the monastery resulted in her reputation for holiness. She was later to be canonised and declared a saint of the Catholic Church.

==Issue==
Adela and Stephen&#x27;s children are listed here in probable birth order. Their birth order is uncertain. 
*William, Count of Sully
*Theobald II, Count of Champagne
*Odo of Blois 
* Adela, married Milo II of Montlhéry
*Stephen, King of England
*Lucia-Mahaut, married Richard d&#x27;Avranches, 2nd Earl of Chester. Both drowned on 25 November 1120 in the &quot;White Ship&quot; disaster.
*Agnes, married Hugh III of Le Puiset and were parents to Hugh de Puiset, Bishop of Durham
* Alix, married Renaud III of Joigny 
*Henry, Bishop of Winchester (1096–1171), an oblate child raised at Cluny Abbey in Saône-et-Loire, France
*Eleanor of Champagne
Some of the daughters may have been step-daughters of Adela, rather than biological children. It is known that Adela had five biological sons and may have had three or more daughters, though not all of the daughters were necessarily Adela&#x27;s biological children. The daughters are not mentioned by name during their youth, only appearing when they reached marriageable age and played an important part in building alliances.

==Legacy==
Adela is a saint in the Roman Catholic church. Her feast day is 24 February. She was deeply religious and supported scholars and poets. Throughout her life she generously endowed various abbeys and churches, helping to expand and preserve the culture and art of her time.

<text>Yuri Yankelevich (Russian: Юрий Исаевич Янкелевич) (7 March 1909 – 22 September 1973) was a Soviet violin pedagogue who taught many internationally known virtuosos during his long tenure at the Moscow Conservatory.

==Life and career==
Yuri Yankelevich was born in Basel, Switzerland. His father, Isay Leontyevich Yankelevich, a prominent lawyer, was one of the founders of the Omsk Philharmonic Society. In Omsk, young Yuri studied with Leopold Auer&#x27;s student, Anisim Berlin, a grandfather of Natalia Gutman. In 1923 he entered Leningrad Conservatory, the class of Hovhaness Nalbandian (also a student of Leopold Auer). On Yankelevich&#x27;s graduation composer Alexander Glazunov commented: &quot;a career of a virtuoso violinist would certainly be his calling&quot;. In 1932 he graduated from the Moscow Conservatory under professor Abram Yampolsky, and finished his doctorate degree in 1937. Between 1930 and 1937 he was an assistant concertmaster in the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra, and afterwards concentrated primarily on pedagogical activities. Since 1934 he taught at the Moscow Conservatory School, the Moscow Conservatory College, and at the Moscow Conservatory senior division (first as Yampolsky&#x27;s assistant, and later leading his own studio, eventually becoming a head of the violin department). He was also devoted to the theory of violin playing, creating a series of methodological publications. Yankelevich died in Moscow.

<text>CVCC, or , is an internal combustion engine technology developed and trademarked by the Honda Motor Company.

The technology&#x27;s name refers to its primary features: Compound refers to the use of two combustion chambers; Vortex refers to the vortex generated in the main combustion chamber, increasing combustion speed, and Controlled Combustion refers to combustion occurring in a timely, controlled manner.

The engine innovatively used a secondary, smaller auxiliary inlet valve to feed a richer air-fuel mixture to the combustion chamber around the spark plug, while the standard inlet valve fed a leaner air-fuel mixture to the remainder of the chamber, creating a more efficient and complete combustion.

== History ==
Following the establishment of an &quot;Air Pollution Research Group&quot; by Honda in 1965, its collection of emissions data from American automakers, and subsequent research into emissions control and prechambers, the first mention of CVCC technology was by Soichiro Honda on February 12, 1971, at the Federation of Economic Organizations Hall in Otemachi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo.

On the advice of University of Tokyo professor Tsuyoshi Asanuma, then-Honda R&amp;D Director Tasuku Date, Engine-performance Research Block head Shizuo Yagi, and then-Engineering Design Chief Engineer Kazuo Nakagawa began research into lean combustion. After Date suggested the use of a prechamber, which some diesel engines utilized, the first engine to be installed with the CVCC approach for testing was a single-cylinder, 300 cc version of Honda&#x27;s EA engine installed in a modified Honda N600 hatchback in January 1970. This technology allowed Honda&#x27;s cars to meet Japanese and American emissions standards in the 1970s without the need for a catalytic converter.

A type of stratified charge technology, it was publicized on October 11, 1972 and licensed to Toyota (as TTC-V), Ford, Chrysler, and Isuzu before making its production debut in the 1975 &quot;ED1&quot; engine. As emission laws advanced and required more stringent admissible levels, CVCC was abandoned in favour of PGM-FI (Programmed Fuel Injection) on all Honda vehicles. Some Honda vehicles in Japan used electronically controlled &quot;PGM-Carb&quot; carburetors on transitional Honda D, E and ZC engines.

In 2007, the Honda CVCC technology was added to Japan&#x27;s Mechanical Engineering Heritage list.

== Operation ==
Honda CVCC engines have normal inlet and exhaust valves, plus a small auxiliary inlet valve. On the intake stroke a large amount of a very lean mixture is drawn into the main combustion chamber; at the same time a very small amount of rich mixture is pulled into the pre-chamber near the spark plug. The pre-chamber near the spark plug is contained by a small perforated metal plate. At the end of the compression stroke, the pre-chamber is rich in fuel, there is a moderately rich mixture in the main chamber near the pre-chamber outlet and the rest of the main chamber is quite lean. On ignition, flame fronts emerge from the perforations and ignite the remainder of the air–fuel charge. When the sparkplug in the pre-chamber fires, the rich mixture ignites easily and the flame spreads from there into the main chamber, igniting a mixture so lean it wouldn&#x27;t have fired satisfactorily with just a sparkplug. The remaining engine cycle is as per a standard four-stroke engine.

Formation of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons are minimized by the overall leanness of the mixture, and the stable and slow burning in the main combustion chamber keeps peak temperature low enough to suppress formation of oxides of nitrogen while keeping the mean temperature high enough long enough to give low hydrocarbon emissions. The design allowed the engine to burn less fuel more efficiently without the use of an exhaust gas recirculation valve or a catalytic converter, although those methods were installed subsequently to further improve emission reduction.

== Advantages ==
The most significant advantage with CVCC was that it allowed for carbureted engines that did not rely on intake swirl. Previous stratified charge engines needed costly fuel injection systems. Additionally, previous engines tried to increase the velocity and swirl of the intake charge to keep rich and lean mixtures separated; Honda was able to maintain separation via the shape of the combustion chamber.

The design of CVCC also allowed it to be adapted to existing engines, since only the cylinder head needed to be modified.

== Early design flaw ==
Some early CVCC engines had problems with the auxiliary valves&#x27; retaining collars vibrating loose. Once unscrewed, oil would leak from the valvetrain into the prechamber, causing a sudden loss of power and large amounts of smoke to flow from the exhaust pipe. These symptoms usually indicated the failure of critical oil seals in the motor that would result in costly repairs. However, the solution was quite simple; Honda corrected the problem with metal retaining rings that slipped over the valves&#x27; retaining collars and prevented them from backing out of their threads.

==CVCC-II==
The 1983 Honda Prelude (the first year of the second generation of Preludes) used CVCC in combination with a catalytic converter to reduce emissions, along with two separate side draft carburetors (instead of a single, progressive twin-choke carburetor). This new system was called CVCC-II. The following year, a standard cylinder head design was used, and the center carburetor (providing the rich mixture) was removed. The Honda City AA, introduced in November 1981, also used a CVCC-II engine called the ER. Its use of CVCC was also known as COMBAX (COMpact Blazing-combustion AXiom).

<doc id="514783" wikidata="Q6165948" url="?curid=514783" title="Herbal">
<text>A herbal is a book containing the names and descriptions of plants, usually with information on their medicinal, tonic, culinary, toxic, hallucinatory, aromatic, or magical powers, and the legends associated with them. A herbal may also classify the plants it describes, may give recipes for herbal extracts, tinctures, or potions, and sometimes include mineral and animal medicaments in addition to those obtained from plants. Herbals were often illustrated to assist plant identification.

Herbals were among the first literature produced in Ancient Egypt, China, India, and Europe as the medical wisdom of the day accumulated by herbalists, apothecaries and physicians. Herbals were also among the first books to be printed in both China and Europe. In Western Europe herbals flourished for two centuries following the introduction of moveable type (c. 1470–1670).

In the late 17th century, the rise of modern chemistry, toxicology and pharmacology reduced the medicinal value of the classical herbal. As reference manuals for botanical study and plant identification herbals were supplanted by Floras – systematic accounts of the plants found growing in a particular region, with scientifically accurate botanical descriptions, classification, and illustrations. Herbals have seen a modest revival in the Western world since the last decades of the 20th century, as herbalism and related disciplines (such as homeopathy and aromatherapy) became popular forms of alternative medicine.

==History==

The use of plants for medicinal purposes, and their descriptions, dates back two to three thousand years. The word &quot;herbal&quot; is derived from the mediaeval Latin &quot;liber herbalis&quot; (&quot;book of herbs&quot;): it is sometimes used in contrast to the word &quot;florilegium&quot;, which is a treatise on flowers with emphasis on their beauty and enjoyment rather than the herbal emphasis on their utility. Much of the information found in printed herbals arose out of traditional medicine and herbal knowledge that predated the invention of writing.

Before the advent of printing, herbals were produced as manuscripts, which could be kept as scrolls or loose sheets, or bound into codices. Early handwritten herbals were often illustrated with paintings and drawings. Like other manuscript books, herbals were &quot;published&quot; through repeated copying by hand, either by professional scribes or by the readers themselves. In the process of making a copy, the copyist would often translate, expand, adapt, or reorder the content. Most of the original herbals have been lost; many have survived only as later copies (of copies...), and others are known only through references from other texts.

As printing became available, it was promptly used to publish herbals, the first printed matter being known as incunabula. In Europe, the first printed herbal with woodcut (xylograph) illustrations, the &quot;Puch der Natur&quot; of Konrad of Megenberg, appeared in 1475. Metal-engraved plates were first used in about 1580. As woodcuts and metal engravings could be reproduced indefinitely they were traded among printers: there was therefore a large increase in the number of illustrations together with an improvement in quality and detail but a tendency for repetition.

As examples of some of the world&#x27;s most important records and first printed matter, a researcher will find herbals scattered through the world&#x27;s most famous libraries including the Vatican Library in Rome, the Bodleian Library in Oxford, the Royal Library in Windsor, the British Library in London and the major continental libraries.

==China, India, Mexico==

===Shen Nung Pen Ts’ao ching of China===

China is renowned for its traditional herbal medicines that date back thousands of years. Legend has it that mythical Emperor Shennong, the founder of Chinese herbal medicine, composed the &quot;Shennong Bencao Jing&quot; or &quot;Great Herbal&quot; in about 2700 BCE as the forerunner of all later Chinese herbals. It survives as a copy made c. 500 CE and describes about 365 herbs. High quality herbals and monographs on particular plants were produced in the period to 1250 CE including: the &quot;Zhenlei bencao&quot; written by Tang Shenwei in 1108, which passed through twelve editions until 1600; a monograph on the lychee by Cai Xiang in 1059 and one on the oranges of Wenzhhou by Han Yanzhi in 1178. In 1406 Ming dynasty prince Zhu Xiao (朱橚) published the &quot;Jiuhuang Bencao&quot; illustrated herbal for famine foods. It contained high quality woodcuts and descriptions of 414 species of plants of which 276 were described for the first time, the book pre-dating the first European printed book by 69 years. It was reprinted many times. Other herbals include &quot;Bencao Fahui&quot; in 1450 by Xu Yong and &quot;Bencao Gangmu&quot; of Li Shizhen in 1590.

===Sushruta Samhita of India===

Traditional herbal medicine of India, known as Ayurveda, possibly dates back to the second millennium BCE tracing its origins to the holy Hindu Vedas and, in particular, the Atharvaveda. One authentic compilation of teachings is by the surgeon Sushruta, available in a treatise called Sushruta Samhita. This contains 184 chapters and description of 1120 illnesses, 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources and 57 preparations based on animal sources. Other early works of Ayurveda include the &quot;Charaka Samhita&quot;, attributed to Charaka. This tradition, however is mostly oral. The earliest surviving written material which contains the works of Sushruta is the &quot;Bower Manuscript&quot;—dated to the 4th century CE.

===Hernandez – &quot;Rerum Medicarum&quot; and the Aztecs===
An illustrated herbal published in Mexico in 1552, &quot;Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis&quot; (&quot;Book of Medicinal Herbs of the Indies&quot;), is written in the Aztec Nauhuatl language by a native physician, Martín Cruz. This is probably an extremely early account of the medicine of the Aztecs although the formal illustrations, resembling European ones, suggest that the artists were following the traditions of their Spanish masters rather than an indigenous style of drawing. In 1570 Francisco Hernández (c.1514–1580) was sent from Spain to study the natural resources of New Spain (now Mexico). Here he drew on indigenous sources, including the extensive botanical gardens that had been established by the Aztecs, to record c. 1200 plants in his &quot;Rerum Medicarum&quot; of 1615. Nicolás Monardes’ &quot;Dos Libros&quot; (1569) contains the first published illustration of tobacco.

==Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece and Rome==

By about 2000 BCE, medical papyri in ancient Egypt included medical prescriptions based on plant matter and made reference to the herbalist&#x27;s combination of medicines and magic for healing.

===Papyrus Ebers===
The ancient Egyptian Papyrus Ebers is one of the earliest known herbals; it dates to 1550 BCE and is based on sources, now lost, dating back a further 500 to 2000 years. The earliest Sumerian herbal dates from about 2500 BCE as a copied manuscript of the 7th century BCE. Inscribed Assyrian tablets dated 668–626 BCE list about 250 vegetable drugs: the tablets include herbal plant names that are still in use today including: saffron, cumin, turmeric and sesame.

The ancient Greeks gleaned much of their medicinal knowledge from Egypt and Mesopotamia. Hippocrates (460–377 BCE), the &quot;father of medicine&quot; (renowned for the eponymous Hippocratic oath), used about 400 drugs, most being of plant origin. However, the first Greek herbal of any note was written by Diocles of Carystus in the fourth century BC—although nothing remains of this except its mention in the written record. It was Aristotle’s pupil Theophrastus (371–287 BCE) in his &quot;Historia Plantarum&quot;, (better known as the &quot;Enquiry into Plants&quot;) and &quot;De Causis Plantarum&quot; (&quot;On the Causes of Plants&quot;) that established the scientific method of careful and critical observation associated with modern botanical science. Based largely on Aristotle’s notes, the Ninth Book of his &quot;Enquiry&quot; deals specifically with medicinal herbs and their uses including the recommendations of herbalists and druggists of the day, and his plant descriptions often included their natural habitat and geographic distribution. With the formation of the Alexandrian School c. 330 BCE medicine flourished and written herbals of this period included those of the physicians Herophilus, Mantias, Andreas of Karystos, Appolonius Mys, and Nicander. The work of rhizomatist (the rhizomati were the doctors of the day, berated by Theophrastus for their superstition) Krateuas (fl. 110 BCE) is of special note because he initiated the tradition of the illustrated herbal in the first century BCE.

===Dioscorides – &quot;De Materia Medica&quot;===

The &quot;De Materia Medica&quot; (c. 40–90 CE; Greek, Περί ύλης ιατρικής &quot;Peri hules iatrikes&quot;, &#x27;On medical materials&#x27;) of Pedanios Dioscorides, a physician in the Roman army, was produced in about 65 CE. It was the single greatest classical authority on the subject and the most influential herbal ever written, serving as a model for herbals and pharmacopoeias, both oriental and occidental, for the next 1000 years up to the Renaissance. It drew together much of the accumulated herbal knowledge of the time, including some 500 medicinal plants. The original has been lost but a lavishly illustrated Byzantine copy known as the &quot;Vienna Dioscurides&quot; dating from about 512 CE remains.

===Pliny – &quot;Natural History&quot;===
Pliny the Elder&#x27;s (23–79 CE) encyclopaedic &quot;Natural History&quot; (c. 77–79 CE) is a synthesis of the information contained in about 2000 scrolls and it includes myths and folklore; there are about 200 extant copies. It comprises 37 books of which sixteen (Books 12–27) are devoted to trees, plants and medicaments and, of these, seven describe medicinal plants. In medieval herbals, along with &quot;De Materia Medica&quot; it is Pliny&#x27;s work that is the most frequently mentioned of the classical texts, even though Galen&#x27;s (131–201 CE) &quot;De Simplicibus&quot; is more detailed. Another Latin translation of Greek works that was widely copied in the Middle Ages, probably illustrated in the original, was that attributed to Apuleius: it also contained the alternative names for particular plants given in several languages. It dates to about 400 CE and a surviving copy dates to about 600 CE.

==The Middle Ages and Arab World==
During the 600 years of the European Middle Ages from 600 to 1200, the tradition of herbal lore fell to the monasteries. Many of the monks were skilled at producing books and manuscripts and tending both medicinal gardens and the sick, but written works of this period simply emulated those of the classical era.

Meanwhile, in the Arab world, by 900 the great Greek herbals had been translated and copies lodged in centres of learning in the Byzantine empire of the eastern Mediterranean including Byzantium, Damascus, Cairo and Baghdad where they were combined with the botanical and pharmacological lore of the Orient. In the medieval Islamic world, Muslim botanists and Muslim physicians made a major contribution to the knowledge of herbal medicines. Those associated with this period include Mesue Maior (Masawaiyh, 777–857) who, in his &quot;Opera Medicinalia&quot;, synthesised the knowledge of Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Indians and Babylonians, this work was complemented by the medical encyclopaedia of Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980–1037). Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot; was used for centuries in both East and West. During this period Islamic science protected classical botanical knowledge that had been ignored in the West and Muslim pharmacy thrived.

===Anglo-Saxon herbals===
Anglo-Saxon plant knowledge and gardening skills (the garden was called a &quot;wyrtzerd&quot;, literally, herb-yard) appears to have exceeded that on the continent. Our limited knowledge of Anglo-Saxon plant vernacular comes primarily from manuscripts that include: the Leechbook of Bald and the Lacnunga. The Leechbook of Bald (Bald was probably a friend of King Alfred of England) was painstakingly produced by the scribe Cild in about 900–950 CE. This was written in the vernacular (native) tongue and not derived from Greek texts. The oldest illustrated herbal from Saxon times is a translation of the Latin &quot;Herbarius Apulei Platonici&quot;, one of the most popular medical works of medieval times, the original dating from the fifth century; this Saxon translation was produced about 1000–1050 CE and is housed in the British Library. Another vernacular herbal was the &quot;Buch der natur&quot; or &quot;Book of Nature&quot; by Konrad von Megenberg (1309–1374) which contains the first two botanical woodcuts ever made; it is also the first work of its kind in the vernacular.

===Anglo-Norman herbals===
In the 12th and early 13th centuries, under the influence of the Norman conquest, the herbals produced in Britain fell less under the influence of France and Germany and more that of Sicily and the Near East. This showed itself through the Byzantine-influenced Romanesque framed illustrations. Anglo-Saxon herbals in the vernacular were replaced by herbals in Latin including Macers Herbal, &quot;De Viribus Herbarum&quot; (largely derived from Pliny), with the English translation completed in about 1373.

===Albertus Magnus – &quot;De Vegetabilibus&quot;===

In the thirteenth century, scientific inquiry was returning and this was manifest through the production of encyclopaedias; those noted for their plant content included a seven volume treatise by Albertus Magnus (c. 1193–1280) a Suabian educated at the University of Padua and tutor to St Thomas Aquinas. It was called &quot;De Vegetabilibus&quot; (c. 1256 AD) and even though based on original observations and plant descriptions it bore a close resemblance to the earlier Greek, Roman and Arabic herbals. Other accounts of the period include &quot;De Proprietatibus Rerum&quot; (c. 1230–1240) of English Franciscan friar Bartholomaeus Anglicus and a group of herbals called &quot;Tractatus de Herbis&quot; written and painted between 1280 and 1300 by Matthaeus Platearius at the East-West cultural centre of Salerno Spain, the illustrations showing the fine detail of true botanical illustration.

==Western Europe and the Renaissance==
Perhaps the best known herbals were produced in Europe between 1470 and 1670. The invention in Germany of printing from movable type in a printing press c. 1440 was a great stimulus to herbalism. The new herbals were more detailed with greater general appeal and often with Gothic script and the addition of woodcut illustrations that more closely resembled the plants being described.

Three important herbals, all appearing before 1500, were printed in Mainz, Germany. Two of these were by Peter Schoeffer, his Latin &quot;Herbarius&quot; in 1484, followed by an updated and enlarged German version in 1485, these being followed in 1491 by the &quot;Hortus Sanitatis&quot; printed by Jacob Meyderbach. Other early printed herbals include the &quot;Kreuterbuch&quot; of Hieronymus Tragus from Germany in 1539 and, in England, the &quot;New Herball&quot; of William Turner in 1551 were arranged, like the classical herbals, either alphabetically, according to their medicinal properties, or as &quot;herbs, shrubs, trees&quot;. Arrangement of plants in later herbals such as &quot;Cruydboeck&quot; of Dodoens and John Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Herball&quot; of 1597 became more related to their physical similarities and this heralded the beginnings of scientific classification. By 1640 a herbal had been printed that included about 3800 plants – nearly all the plants of the day that were known.

In the Modern Age and Renaissance, European herbals diversified and innovated, and came to rely more on direct observation than being mere adaptations of traditional models. Typical examples from the period are the fully illustrated &quot;De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes&quot; by Leonhart Fuchs (1542, with over 400 plants), the astrologically themed &quot;Complete Herbal&quot; by Nicholas Culpeper (1653), and the &quot;Curious Herbal&quot; by Elizabeth Blackwell (1737).

===Fifteenth-century incunabula===
The earliest printed books and broadsheets are known as incunabula. The first printed herbal appeared in 1469, a version of Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Historia Naturalis&quot;; it was published nine years before Dioscorides &quot;De Materia Medica&quot; was set in type. Important incunabula include the encyclopaedic &quot;De Proprietatibus Rerum&quot; of Franciscan friar Bartholomew Anglicus (c. 1203–1272) which, as a manuscript, had first appeared between 1248 and 1260 in at least six languages and after being first printed in 1470 ran to 25 editions. Assyrian physician Mesue (926–1016) wrote the popular &quot;De Simplicibus&quot;, &quot;Grabadin&quot; and &quot;Liber Medicinarum Particularum&quot; the first of his printings being in 1471. These were followed, in Italy, by the &quot;Herbarium&quot; of Apuleius Platonicus and three German works published in Mainz, the &quot;Latin Herbarius&quot; (1484), the first herbal published in Germany, &quot;German Herbarius&quot; (1485), the latter evolving into the &quot;Ortus Sanitatis&quot; (1491). To these can be added Macer’s &quot;De Virtutibus Herbarum&quot;, based on Pliny&#x27;s work; the 1477 edition is one of the first printed and illustrated herbals.

===Fifteenth-century manuscripts===
In medieval times, medicinal herbs were generally referred to by the apothecaries (physicians or doctors) as &quot;simples&quot; or &quot;officinals&quot;. Before 1542, the works principally used by apothecaries were the treatises on simples by Avicenna and Serapion’s &quot;Liber De Simplici Medicina&quot;. The &quot;De Synonymis&quot; and other publications of Simon Januensis, the &quot;Liber Servitoris&quot; of Bulchasim Ben Aberazerim, which described the preparations made from plants, animals and minerals, provided a model for the chemical treatment of modern pharmacopoeias. There was also the &quot;Antidotarium Nicolai&quot; of Nicolaus de Salerno, which contained Galenical compounds arranged in alphabetical order.

===Spain and Portugal – de Orta, Monardes, Hernandez===
The Spaniards and Portuguese were explorers, the Portuguese to India (Vasco da Gama) and Goa where physician Garcia de Orta (1490–1570) based his work &quot;Colóquios dos Simples&quot; (1563). The first botanical knowledge of the New World came from Spaniard Nicolas Monardes (1493–1588) who published &quot;Dos Libros&quot; between 1569 and 1571. The work of Hernandez on the herbal medicine of the Aztecs has already been discussed.

===Germany – Bock, Brunfels and Fuchs===

Otto Brunfels (c. 1489–1534), Leonhart Fuchs (1501–1566) and Hieronymus Bock (1498–1554) were known as the &quot;German fathers of botany&quot; although this title belies the fact that they trod in the steps of the scientifically celebrated Hildegard of Bingen whose writings on herbalism were &quot;Physica&quot; and &quot;Causae et Curae&quot; (together known as &quot;Liber subtilatum&quot;) of 1150. The original manuscript is no longer in existence but a copy was printed in 1533. Another major herbalist was Valerius Cordus (1515–1544).

The 1530, &quot;Herbarum Vivae Eicones&quot; of Brunfels contained the admired botanically accurate original woodcut colour illustrations of Hans Weiditz along with descriptions of 47 species new to science. Bock, in setting out to describe the plants of his native Germany, produced the &quot;New Kreuterbuch&quot; of 1539 describing the plants he had found in the woods and fields but without illustration; this was supplemented by a second edition in 1546 that contained 365 woodcuts. Bock was possibly the first to adopt a botanical classification in his herbal which also covered details of ecology and plant communities. In this, he was placing emphasis on botanical rather than medicinal characteristics, unlike the other German herbals and foreshadowing the modern Flora. &quot;De Historia Stirpium&quot; (1542 with a German version in 1843) of Fuchs was a later publication with 509 high quality woodcuts that again paid close attention to botanical detail: it included many plants introduced to Germany in the sixteenth century that were new to science. The work of Fuchs is regarded as being among the most accomplished of the Renaissance period.

===Low Countries – Dodoens, Lobel, Clusius===
The Flemish printer Christopher Plantin established a reputation publishing the works of Dutch herbalists Rembert Dodoens and Carolus Clusius and developing a vast library of illustrations. Translations of early Greco-Roman texts published in German by Bock in 1546 as &quot;Kreuterbuch&quot; were subsequently translated into Dutch as &quot;Pemptades&quot; by Dodoens (1517–1585) who was a Belgian botanist of world renown. This was an elaboration of his first publication &quot;Cruydeboeck&quot; (1554). Matthias de Lobel (1538–1616) published his &quot;Stirpium Adversaria Nova&quot; (1570–1571) and a massive compilation of illustrations while Clusius&#x27;s (1526–1609) magnum opus was &quot;Rariorum Plantarum Historia&quot; of 1601 which was a compilation of his Spanish and Hungarian floras and included over 600 plants that were new to science.

===Italy – Mattioli, Calzolari, Alpino===
In Italy, two herbals were beginning to include botanical descriptions. Notable herbalists included Pietro Andrea Mattioli (1501–1577), physician to the Italian aristocracy and his &quot;Commentarii&quot; (1544), which included many newly described species, and his more traditional herbal &quot;Epistolarum Medicinalium Libri Quinque&quot; (1561). Sometimes, the local flora was described as in the publication &quot;Viaggio di Monte Baldo&quot; (1566) of Francisco Calzolari. Prospero Alpini (1553–1617) published in 1592 the highly popular account of overseas plants &quot;De Plantis Aegypti&quot; and he also established a botanical garden in Padua in 1542, which together with those at Pisa and Florence, rank among the world&#x27;s first.

===England – Turner, Gerard, Parkinson, Culpeper===

The first true herbal printed in Britain was Richard Banckes&#x27; &quot;Herball&quot; of 1525 which, although popular in its day, was unillustrated and soon eclipsed by the most famous of the early printed herbals, Peter Treveris&#x27;s &quot;Grete Herball&quot; of 1526 (derived in turn from the derivative French &quot;Grand Herbier&quot;).

William Turner (?1508–7 to 1568) was an English naturalist, botanist, and theologian who studied at Cambridge University and eventually became known as the “father of English botany.&quot; His 1538 publication &quot;Libellus de re Herbaria Novus&quot; was the first essay on scientific botany in English. His three-part &quot;A New Herball&quot; of 1551–1562–1568, with woodcut illustrations taken from Fuchs, was noted for its original contributions and extensive medicinal content; it was also more accessible to readers, being written in vernacular English. Turner described over 200 species native to England. and his work had a strong influence on later eminent botanists such as John Ray and Jean Bauhin.

John Gerard (1545–1612) is the most famous of all the English herbalists. His &quot;Herball&quot; of 1597 is, like most herbals, largely derivative. It appears to be a reformulation of Hieronymus Bock&#x27;s &quot;Kreuterbuch&quot; subsequently translated into Dutch as &quot;Pemptades&quot; by Rembert Dodoens (1517–1585), and thence into English by Carolus Clusius, (1526–1609) then re-worked by Henry Lyte in 1578 as &quot;A Nievve Herball&quot;. This became the basis of Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Herball&quot; or &quot;General Historie of Plantes&quot;. that appeared in 1597 with its 1800 woodcuts (only 16 original). Although largely derivative, Gerard&#x27;s popularity can be attributed to his evocation of plants and places in Elizabethan England and to the clear influence of gardens and gardening on this work.
He had published, in 1596, &quot;Catalogus&quot; which was a list of 1033 plants growing in his garden.

John Parkinson (1567–1650) was apothecary to James I and a founding member of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries. He was an enthusiastic and skilful gardener, his garden in Long Acre being stocked with rarities. He maintained an active correspondence with important English and Continental botanists, herbalists and plantsmen importing new and unusual plants from overseas, in particular the Levant and Virginia. Parkinson is celebrated for his two monumental works, the first &quot;Paradisi in Sole Paradisus Terrestris&quot; in 1629: this was essentially a gardening book, a florilegium for which Charles I awarded him the title &quot;Botanicus Regius Primarius&quot; – Royal Botanist. The second was his &quot;Theatrum Botanicum&quot; of 1640, the largest herbal ever produced in the English language. It lacked the quality illustrations of Gerard&#x27;s works, but was a massive and informative compendium including about 3800 plants (twice the number of Gerard&#x27;s first edition &quot;Herball&quot;), over 1750 pages and over 2,700 woodcuts. This was effectively the last and culminating herbal of its kind and, although it included more plants of no discernible economic or medicinal use than ever before, they were nevertheless arranged according to their properties rather than their natural affinities.
Nicholas Culpeper (1616–1654) was an English botanist, herbalist, physician, apothecary and astrologer from London&#x27;s East End. His published books were &quot;A Physicall Directory&quot; (1649), which was a pseudoscientific pharmacopoeia. &quot;The English Physitian&quot; (1652) and the &quot;Complete Herbal&quot; (1653), contain a rich store of pharmaceutical and herbal knowledge. His works lacked scientific credibility because of their use of astrology, though he combined diseases, plants and astrological prognosis into a simple integrated system that has proved popular to the present day.

==Legacy==

The legacy of the herbal extends beyond medicine to botany and horticulture. Herbal medicine is still practiced in many parts of the world but the traditional grand herbal, as described here, ended with the European Renaissance, the rise of modern medicine and the use of synthetic and industrialized drugs. The medicinal component of herbals has developed in several ways. Firstly, discussion of plant lore was reduced and with the increased medical content there emerged the official pharmacopoeia. The first British Pharmacopoeia was published in the English language in 1864, but gave such general dissatisfaction both to the medical profession and to chemists and druggists that the General Medical Council brought out a new and amended edition in 1867. Secondly, at a more popular level, there are the books on culinary herbs and herb gardens, medicinal and useful plants. Finally, the enduring desire for simple medicinal information on specific plants has resulted in contemporary herbals that echo the herbals of the past, an example being Maud Grieve&#x27;s &quot;A Modern Herbal&quot;, first published in 1931 but with many subsequent editions.

The magical and mystical side of the herbal also lives on. Herbals often explained plant lore, displaying a superstitious or spiritual side. There was, for example, the fanciful doctrine of signatures, the belief that there were similarities in the appearance of the part of the body affected the appearance of the plant to be used as a remedy. The astrology of Culpeper can be seen in contemporary anthroposophy (biodynamic gardening) and alternative medical approaches like homeopathy, aromatherapy and other new age medicine show connections with herbals and traditional medicine.

It is sometimes forgotten that the plants described in herbals were grown in special herb gardens (physic gardens). Such herb gardens were, for example, part of the medieval monastery garden that supplied the simples or officinals used to treat the sick being cared for within the monastery. Early physic gardens were also associated with institutes of learning, whether a monastery, university or herbarium. It was this medieval garden of the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries, attended by apothecaries and physicians, that established a tradition leading to the systems gardens of the eighteenth century (gardens that demonstrated the classification system of plants) and the modern botanical garden. The advent of printing, woodcuts and metal engraving improved the means of communication. Herbals prepared the ground for modern botanical science by pioneering plant description, classification and illustration. From the time of the ancients like Dioscorides through to Parkinson in 1629, the scope of the herbal remained essentially the same.

The greatest legacy of the herbal is to botany. Up to the seventeenth century, botany and medicine were one and the same but gradually greater emphasis was placed on the plants rather than their medicinal properties. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, plant description and classification began to relate plants to one another and not to man. This was the first glimpse of non-anthropocentric botanical science since Theophrastus and, coupled with the new system of binomial nomenclature, resulted in &quot;scientific herbals&quot; called &quot;Floras&quot; that detailed and illustrated the plants growing in a particular region. These books were often backed by herbaria, collections of dried plants that verified the plant descriptions given in the Floras. In this way modern botany, especially plant taxonomy, was born out of medicine. As herbal historian Agnes Arber remarks – &quot;Sibthorp&#x27;s monumental &quot;Flora Graeca&quot; is, indeed, the direct descendant in modern science of the &quot;De Materia Medica&quot; of Dioscorides.&quot;

<text>Los Van Van is one of the leading musical groups of post-revolutionary Cuba. It was founded in 1969 by bassist Juan Formell, who directed the band until his death in 2014. Formell and former band members Changuito and Pupy are some of the most important figures in contemporary Cuban music, having contributed to the development of songo and timba, two popular dance music genres.
==History==
In 1967, Formell became musical director of Elio Revé&#x27;s charanga orchestra. The sound of Orquesta Revé at that time was a unique blend of Cuban son and late-&#x27;60s rock. Formell reformed the group into Changui &#x27;68, and then founded his own group, Los Van Van, on December 4, 1969.

[Juan Formell] was convinced that he could capture the imagination of Cuba&#x27;s younger generation by infusing Revé&#x27;s arrangements with elements of North American rock and roll, creating an odd new style that he called &quot;changüí 68&quot;. Early the next year, almost exactly a decade after Revé&#x27;s band had jumped ship to form [Orquesta] Ritmo Oriental, . . . Formell incited the most famous of the Revé mutinies and absconded with the majority of the musicians to form a group which has stayed at the true leading edge of its country&#x27;s music longer than any other . . . at first Formell relied heavily on the songs and stylistic tendencies of his previous work with Revé. The harmonies, never before heard in Cuban music, were clearly borrowed from North American pop—in some cases rather corny North American pop . . . their sudden commercial popularity shattered the formulaic limitations on harmony to which Cuban popular music had faithfully adhered for so long . . . rhythmically, the 1969 group made the transition from changüí 68 to the first incarnation of a style which Formell called &quot;songo&quot; (Moore 2011).

The original personnel of Los Van Van were Juan Formell (leader, bass guitar, vocals); Orlando Canto (flute); Raúl &quot;El Yulo&quot; Cárdenas (congas); Blas Egües (drum kit); Luis Marsilli (cello); José Luis Martínez (electric guitar, vocals); Julio Noroña (güiro); Pupy Pedroso (keyboard); Miguel Angel &quot;Lele&quot; Rasalps (vocals); William Sánchez (electric guitar), and Gerardo Miró, Jesús Linare, Fernando Leyva, and Iván Rocha (violins).

Juan Formell states that the main piano guajeo of &quot;La lucha&quot;s (1969) montuno section was inspired by the Afro‐Cuban folkloric batá drum rhythm chachalokefún.

===1970s===
José Luis &quot;Changuito&quot; Quintana replaced Egües in 1970. Changuito greatly expanded the parameters of songo, and introduced a revolutionary conga and timbales technique, by incorporating snare drum rudiments. Changuito is the most influential Cuban percussionist of the latter twentieth century.

Changuito&#x27;s rhythmic contributions coincided with Formell&#x27;s maturation as a songwriter and LVV launched into a six year period which alone would have been sufficient to establish them as one of Cuba&#x27;s most important bands. LVV&#x27;s recordings from 1970 to 1976 are the definite starting point for anyone seeking to learn about the enigmatic genre of songo (Moore 2011).

The original single of &quot;Pero a mi manera&quot; (c. 1972) introduced harmonies and arranging ideas never before used in Latin music. Moore describes the chord changes as: &quot;addictive and harmonically ambiguous vamp for the entire montuno section. Arguments could be made for various keys, but to me it sounds like bIII – IV – I – bVI in A. Like the best rock vamps, it never quite resolves, allowing for endless repetitions without losing energy.&quot;

In 1974 Los Van Van released their landmark record &quot;Tránsito&quot; (LD-3421) [Los Van Van v. II]. Also that year, vocalist Pedro Calvo left Orquesta Ritmo Oriental to join Los Van Van. Calvo fronted the band for two decades. &quot;Los Van Van v. V&quot; (Areíto LD-378) (1979) premiered compositions by Pedro Calvo, José Luis &quot;El Tosco&quot; Cortés, and Pupy Pedroso, who would go on to become the group&#x27;s second most prolific composer after Formell.

Some of Formell&#x27;s songo inventions had onbeat, rock-like guajeos as well as rock harmonies. One such song is &quot;Con el bate de aluminio&quot; (1979). The right hand plays steady onbeats, sounding a rock‐influenced imi – bVII – bVI chord progression.

===1980s===
On &quot;Los Van Van&quot; v. 6 (1980) Formell took the unusual step of adding trombones to his charanga format. Orquesta Revé did the same during the time.

On &quot;El baile del buey cansao&quot; (Areíto LD-4045) [Los Van Van v. VII] (1982), Changuito added timbales, which he altered with drum kit. With their 1984 release of &quot;Anda ven y muévete&quot; (Areíto LD-4164) [Los Van Van v. IX], Van Van began getting unprecedented international attention. The title track borrows heavily from Lionel Richie&#x27;s hit &quot;All Night Long.&quot; Salsa singer Rubén Blades later covered &quot;Muévete.&quot;

The following piano guajeo is based on Los Van Van’s biggest hit of the 1980s, &quot;Por encima del nivel,&quot; better known as &quot;La sandunguera,&quot; one of Los Van Van&#x27;s most popular songs from the 1980s.

===2010s===
In 2011, they collaborated with Carlinhos Brown to record the song &quot;Soy Loco por Tí, América&quot; for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s most recent charitable album &quot;Red Hot + Rio 2&quot;. The album is a follow-up to the 1996 &quot;Red Hot + Rio&quot;. Proceeds from the sales were donated to raise awareness and money to fight AIDS/HIV and related health and social issues.

==Musical style==
Using a charanga line-up (flute, string instruments, and rhythm section) as its base, Los Van Van added trombones, and was the first Cuban group to use synthesizers and drum machines. Initially, their sound was a fusion of son montuno, rumba, and North American rock and pop. Later the band incorporated funk, disco, and hip hop, as well as salsa. These influences would first give rise to a style known as songo, and later timba.

Los Van Van has consistently adapted its style to the times, and remains, after 35 years, Cuba&#x27;s most popular dance band. Along with pianist Cesar &quot;Pupy&quot; Pedroso, Juan Formell has written some of the most intriguing verses in popular dance music, including stories that run over several albums and, contrary to trends in timba, all types of social commentary. Both artists are undisputed masters of double-entendre in a musical culture where multiple meanings in lyrics are pervasive. Indeed, the title of the band is probably meant to evoke the novel and compelling rhythms of the new sound of Formell&#x27;s band, as &quot;van&quot; in Spanish means &quot;they go&quot; and so the name of the band could be translated as &quot;those they go, they go&quot; (it has also been suggested to translate as their name as something like &quot;the go-gos!&quot;). When Cesar &quot;Pupy&quot; Pedroso, their pianist and founding member, left the band in 2002 he founded his own band Pupy y los que son son, which is likely a name with a triple-entendre. The word &quot;son&quot; can mean both &quot;they are&quot; and also refers to the traditional music &quot;son&quot; (the same Latin root as &quot;sound&quot;), originating in the eastern provinces of Cuba, from which Cuban-style salsa may have originated. It is also a reference to the idiomatic Spanish expression &quot;those who can, do&quot; presumably as sort of a sly nod to the expression &quot;those who cannot [do something], teach.&quot;

==Awards==
The band has a Latin Grammy Award nomination to their credit, to Best Salsa Album for &quot;Llegó Van Van&quot; (&#x27;Van Van Is Here&#x27;) in the first Latin Grammy Awards ceremony (2000).

In January 2010 &quot;A Cali,&quot; a song from Van Van&#x27;s latest album, was selected as one of the winning songs of the 2009 Cali Fair held in Cali (Colombia), a city known as Colombia&#x27;s &quot;salsa capital&quot;. The selection was made through a public poll that registered 30,742 votes. Van Van&#x27;s &quot;A Cali&quot; received 7,905 of the votes, or 26% of the total.

The Cuban band was honored for the organizer comite of WOMEX fair with the Artist Award 2013.
The laurel was given to the &quot;Train of Cuban music&quot; for having remained the most important and popular dance band in Cuba for more than four decades.
The jury noted that &quot;the imaginative approach in implementing its director Juan Formell, brought new sounds and ideas in Cuban dance music, which merged violins, flute charanga style with a trombone section, drums and electric guitar intro, bass and keyboards&quot;.

Juan Formell was also awarded with the Latin Grammy Award for Excellence 2013 along with other renowned Hispanic musicians, in a ceremony held on November 20, 2013 in Las Vegas.

==Band members==
Los Van Van has been a school for outstanding singers and musicians. Past members with successful careers as solo artists include Pedro Calvo, Angel Bonne, Changuito, José Luis &quot;El Tosco&quot; Cortés (founder of the first timba band NG La Banda), César &quot;Pupy&quot; Pedroso and others. As of 2006, Los Van Van lineup of singers: Mayito Rivera, Roberto Hernandez &quot;Roberton&quot;, Yeni Valdes and Lele Rosales. During 2011 Mayito Rivera left the band going for a solo career and was replaced by Mandy Cantero. Since early January 2017, Yeni Valdes left the band.

<doc id="514795" wikidata="Q6537419" url="?curid=514795" title="Lewiston–Queenston Bridge">
<text>The Lewiston–Queenston Bridge, also known as the Queenston–Lewiston Bridge, is an arch bridge that crosses the Niagara River gorge just south of the Niagara Escarpment. The bridge was officially opened on November 1, 1962. It is an international bridge between the United States and Canada. It connects Interstate 190 in the town of Lewiston, New York to Highway 405 in the community of Queenston, Ontario. The Lewiston–Queenston Bridge is architecturally similar to the Rainbow Bridge at nearby Niagara Falls.

Customs plazas are located on both ends of the bridge, with tolls only being charged on entering Canada ($5.00 USD or $6.50 CAD per passenger automobile). The bridge accepts E-ZPass electronic toll collection and houses the second Canadian E-ZPass collection facility, after the nearby Peace Bridge. Also, two duty-free stores are located between the two plazas.

The bridge permits no pedestrians, but licensed taxi service is permitted. The Lewiston–Queenston Bridge lacks expedited border clearance facilities for NEXUS and FAST card holders traveling from the United States into Canada, but does have a NEXUS lane for travel into the United States.

Gantries have lights indicating the direction of traffic as the lanes are reversible. Speed limit is posted in kilometres and miles per hour ( limit) along the bridge. Canadian and United States flags fly at the midpoint on the south side of the bridge.

==Border crossing and toll==
The crossing is the fourth-busiest on the Canada–United States border, with delays of up to two hours. It is on the most direct route connecting the US Interstate system to Toronto and Detroit. Canada replaced its border inspection facilities in 2011. The United States announced plans in 2016 to spend to upgrade the primary inspection facilities. Construction was completed in 2022. Both facilities are open 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. All commercial vehicles crossing between the US and Canada at the Niagara River must use this crossing.

The toll for use of the bridge is payable upon entering Canada only.

* Canada-bound:
** 10 customs booths for cars/RVs
** 5 customs booths for trucks
** Dedicated Bus Processing Lane
** parking area for trucks for inspections
** helipad
** 6 toll booths
* US-bound:
** 6 customs booths for cars/buses/RVs
** 3 customs booths for trucks
** parking area for trucks for inspections

Passenger vehicles pay a toll only when entering Canada from the US. The cost is $5.00 USD or $6.50 CAD, as of August 1, 2022, payable by cash or E-ZPass.

High mast lighting is used on the Canadian side, with regular light standards used for bridge and the US side.

==Previous suspension bridges==

The first Queenston-Lewiston Bridge was built in 1851 by engineer Edward Serrell and wrecked by wind in 1864 (or 1854). Newspapers reported that bridge deck had been destroyed in February 1864 by wind which caused main deck to sway excessively due to earlier removal of stabilizing guy-wires by local authorities, however main suspension cables remained fully intact. Some of the cables were still in place as late as 1895. The road deck span was about . The suspension bridge design was unusual because the cables were attached to the cliff with only small towers. This made the road deck span shorter than the cable span of .

A second bridge called the Queenston-Lewiston Bridge, a suspension bridge was later constructed. Located north of the current bridge, this suspension bridge was originally built near the present location of the Rainbow Bridge, and was moved to Queenston in 1898 by R.S. Buck and engineer L.L. Buck, after the completion of the Rainbow Bridge&#x27;s predecessor, the Upper Steel Arch Bridge. The suspension bridge was dismantled in 1963 after the current bridge was completed and opened.
Reminders of the earlier bridge are still visible in the area. First is two columns that lie within the Earl W. Brydges Artpark State Park. Second is the original plaque, now located midspan alongside the road, right at the border between the two countries. The plaque is flanked by a US and a Canadian flag.

The supports are part of Owen Morrell&#x27;s Omega, a steel sculpture and observation platform added in 1981. Two columns remain on the Canadian side at the foot of York Street in a wooded area now known as York Park.

==Plane crash==
On December 1, 1961, while the bridge was under construction, an F-100 fighter (variously reported as belonging to the United States Air Force or Air National Guard) caught fire just after taking off from a base near Niagara Falls, New York. To protect people in the city, the pilot steered it into the Niagara River gorge before safely ejecting; but this aimed it near the construction site. It passed not far over the heads of workers near the site, missed a construction crane by about , and crashed into the gorge side about 600 feet beyond the bridge before falling into the river.

<doc id="514797" wikidata="Q652911" url="?curid=514797" title="Ilyushin Il-28">
<text>The Ilyushin Il-28 (; NATO reporting name: Beagle) is a jet bomber of the immediate postwar period that was originally manufactured for the Soviet Air Forces. It was the Soviet Union&#x27;s first such aircraft to enter large-scale production. It was also licence-built in China as the Harbin H-5. Total production in the USSR was 6,316 aircraft, and over 319 H-5s were built. Only 187 examples of the HJ-5 training variant were manufactured. The only H-5s in service currently are approximately 80 aircraft which operate with the Korean People&#x27;s Air Force. 
The Il-28 has the USAF/DoD reporting name &quot;Type 27&quot; and NATO reporting name &quot;Beagle&quot;, while the Il-28U trainer variant has the USAF/DoD reporting name &quot;Type 30&quot; and NATO reporting name Mascot.

==Design and development==
After a number of attempts at a four-engined bomber (the Lyulka TR-1 powered Ilyushin Il-22 and the unbuilt Rolls-Royce Derwent powered Ilyushin Il-24), the Ilyushin Design Bureau began development of a new jet-powered tactical bomber in late 1947. Western intelligence focused on the four-engine developments while the twin-engine Ilyushin Il-28 was created to meet a requirement for a bomber to carry a bombload at . The new design took advantage of the sale of a number of Rolls-Royce Nene jet engines by Great Britain to the Soviet Union, which allowed Soviet engineers to quickly produce an unlicensed copy of the Nene, the RD-45, with Ilyushin designing the new bomber around two RD-45s.

The Il-28 was smaller than the previous designs and carried a crew of only three (pilot, navigator and gunner). It was also smaller than the competing design from the Tupolev design bureau, the three-engined (i.e. two Nenes and a Rolls-Royce Derwent) Tupolev Tu-73, which had been started long before the Ilyushin project, and flew before the design of the Il-28 was approved.
The Il-28 design was conventional in layout, with high, unswept wings and a swept horizontal tail and fin. The engines were carried in bulky nacelles slung directly under the wings. The nosewheel retracted rearwards, while the mainwheels retracted forwards into the engine nacelles. The crew of three were accommodated in separate, pressurised compartments. The navigator, who also acted as bombardier, was accommodated in the glazed nose compartment and was provided with an OPB-5 bombsight based on the American Norden bombsight of the Second World War, while the pilot sat under a sideways opening bubble canopy with an armoured windscreen. The gunner sat in a separate compartment at the rear of the fuselage, operating a power driven turret armed with two Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 23 mm cannons with 250 rounds each. In service, the turret was sometimes removed as a weight saving measure. While the pilot and navigator sat on ejector seats, the gunner had to parachute out of a hatch in the floor in the event of an emergency. Two more fixed, forward-firing 23 mm cannon with 100 rounds each were mounted under the nose and fired by the pilot, while a bomb bay was located in the fuselage, capable of holding four 100 kg (220 lb) bombs in individual containers, or single large bombs of up to 3,000 kg (6,600 lb) slung from a beam in the bomb bay.
One unusual design feature of the Il-28 was that the wings and tail were split horizontally through the centre of the wing, while the fuselage was split vertically at the centreline, allowing the separate parts to be built individually and fitted out with systems before being bolted together to complete assembly of the aircraft. This slightly increased the weight of the aircraft structure, but eased manufacture and proved to be more economical.

The first prototype, powered by two imported Nenes, made its maiden flight on 8 July 1948, with Vladimir Kokkinaki at the controls. Testing was successful, with the Il-28 demonstrating good handling and reaching a speed of 833 km/h (518 mph). It was followed on 30 December 1948 by the second prototype, with Soviet built RD-45 engines replacing the Nenes. After the completion of state tests in early 1949 the aircraft was ordered into large scale production on 14 May 1949, with the Klimov VK-1, an improved version of the RD-45 to be used in order to improve the aircraft&#x27;s performance. The first pre-production aircraft with VK-1 engines flew on 8 August 1949, and featured reshaped engine nacelles to reduce drag, while the radome for the navigation radar was moved from the rear fuselage to just aft of the nosewheel.

Full production in three factories started in September 1949, with service deliveries starting in early 1950, allowing 25 Il-28s to be displayed at the Moscow May Day parade of 1950 (as ordered by Joseph Stalin when it was ordered into production in 1949). The Il-28 soon became the standard tactical bomber in the Soviet forces and was widely exported.

==Operational history==

The Il-28 was widely exported, serving in the air arms of some 20 nations ranging from the Warsaw Pact to various Middle-Eastern and African air forces. Egypt was an early customer, and targeting Egyptian Il-28s on the ground was a priority for the Royal Air Force during the Suez Crisis and later by the Israeli Air Force during the Six-Day War, and Yom Kippur War.

Egyptian Il-28s also took part in the North Yemen Civil War, starting in 1963. In addition to attacks on the royalist forces, they also bombed the Saudi cities of Jizan, Najran, and Khamis Mushait. Two Egyptian Il-28s may have been shot down near Sanaa by Royal Saudi Air Force Hawker Hunters flown by British pilots, in 1966.

The Soviet Union was in the process of providing the type for local assembly in Cuba when this was halted by the Cuban Missile Crisis, after which Nikita Khrushchev agreed to remove them. The type also saw limited use in Vietnam and with the Afghan forces in Afghanistan. Four ex-Egyptian and two ex-Soviet Il-28s (all with Egyptian crews) were operated by the Nigerian Air Force in the Biafra Wars. Finland also had four examples of this type delivered between 1961 and 1966 for target-towing duties. They remained in service until the 1980s.

The Soviet Union had relegated the Il-28 to second-line duties by the late-1950s. The supersonic Yak-28 was introduced in the early 1960s to take over the Beagle&#x27;s low-level attack role; some Il-28 variants lingered in Soviet service into the 1980s. The last Soviet-built examples were still flying in Egypt into the 1990s.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China received over 250 Soviet-built Il-28s from 1952, and when the Sino-Soviet split occurred in the late 1950s, it decided to place the Il-28 into production, despite no manufacturing license being obtained. Chinese-built aircraft differed from the original Soviet aircraft in that they have a redesigned wing structure, abandoning the horizontal manufacturing break, saving at the cost of a more difficult construction. Chinese aircraft also used a different tail turret based on that of the Tupolev Tu-16, and fitted with faster-firing AM-23 cannons.

Chinese-built Il-28s designated H-5 and built by HAMC were still flying in the 1990s with several hundreds in China itself, and a smaller number in North Korea and Romania. The three main Chinese versions are the H-5 bomber, followed by the HJ-5 trainer, and the H-5R (HZ-5) long range (in comparison to the reconnaissance version of the Shenyang J-6) reconnaissance aircraft, and later, the HD-5 ECM/ESM version. The latter two types have been phased out.

The type is known to still be in active service with the North Korean Air Force, although little is known as to whether they are a mix of survivors from the batch of 24 Soviet-manufactured aircraft delivered in the 1960s and some of the newer Chinese-built H-5 variant, or are solely H-5s. Some of these are probably used for spares to maintain a small group of around a dozen serviceable aircraft. They give North Korea a means of bombing targets in South Korea and Western Japan, although they would be vulnerable to modern anti air missiles and interceptors.

Several Ilyushin Il-28s are preserved in museums and as monuments in Russia, Germany, Hungary and in other countries.

<text>Ahmed Adaweyah (; 26 June 1945 – 29 December 2024) was an Egyptian actor and singer of &quot;Sha&#x27;abi&quot; music. He also starred in 27 Egyptian films.

==Early life and career==
Adaweyah was born on 26 June 1945 in Minya Governorate, Egypt, to a livestock dealer, and he lived with 14 siblings. He later moved to Cairo and started his career as a cafe waiter, while he also performed songs in Cairo in 1969, full of working class slang and double entendres. His recordings outsold many others and were circulated via audiocassette in the streets. Among them, &quot;Salamit Ummih Hassan&quot; referred to Egypt (as Umm Hassan) and its defeat in 1967; &quot;Zahma ya Dunia, Zahma&quot; lamented the crowded and hectic conditions in Cairo, &quot;Ya Bint el-Sultan&quot; became a favorite song performed for dancers. Like many &quot;Sha&#x27;abi&quot; singers, Adaweyah was capable of delivering a strong mawal (vocal improvisation). Despite the disapproval of the music establishment and the exclusion of his songs from television or radio, they became popular as they spread on audiocassettes. He advanced to singing in five-star hotels and the best nightclubs of the time. He also had some copyright issues with his song &quot;essah eddah embo&quot; with other performers.

In 1989, Adaweyah was drugged and attacked by a jealous Kuwaiti emir, Talal bin Nasser. Officials claimed that he was found comatose after an overdose of heroin administered by person(s) connected to the jealous husband. Adawiyya recovered sufficiently to sing again, although he was partially paralyzed. He has since appeared on various music programs. In 2009, he had a duet with Ramy Ayach, singing &quot;Elnas Elray&#x27;a&quot;. In 2018, he released a new song &quot;El Helw Wesel&quot;. meaning (The Sweet Reached) with Ukrainian dancer Alla Kushnir appearing in the music video for the song.

==Personal life and death==
Adawuyyah married in 1976, he had a daughter, Warda, and a son, Mehammad, who was also a singer. His wife, Wanisa Ahmad, died in May 2024. 

On 29 December 2024, Adaweyah died from a long illness in Cairo. He was 79.

<doc id="514806" wikidata="Q948098" url="?curid=514806" title="Filefish">
<text>The filefish (Monacanthidae) are a diverse family of tropical to subtropical tetraodontiform marine fish, which are also known as foolfish, leatherjackets or shingles. They live in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Filefish are closely related to triggerfish, pufferfish and trunkfish.

The filefish family comprises approximately 102 species in 27 genera. More than half of the species are found in Australian waters, with 58 species in 23 genera.

Their laterally compressed bodies and rough, sandpapery skin inspired the filefish&#x27;s common name.

==Description==
Appearing very much like their close relatives the triggerfish, filefish are rhomboid-shaped, with beautifully elaborate cryptic patterns. Deeply keeled bodies give a false impression of size when the fish are viewed facing the flanks. Filefish have soft, simple fins, with comparatively small pectoral fins and truncated, fan-shaped tail fins; a slender, retractable spine crowns the head. Although there are usually two of these spines, the second spine is greatly reduced, being used only to lock the first spine in the erect position. That gives rise to the family name &quot;Monacanthidae&quot;, from the Greek &quot;monos&quot; meaning &quot;one&quot; and &quot;akantha&quot; meaning &quot;thorn&quot;. Some species also have recurved spines on the base of the tail (&quot;caudal peduncle&quot;).

The small terminal mouths of filefish have specialized incisor teeth on the upper and lower jaw. In the upper jaw there are four teeth in the inner series and six in the outer series. In the lower jaw, there are four to six in an outer series only. The snout is tapered and projecting and the eyes are located high on the head. Filefish have rough non-overlapping scales with small spikes, which is why they are called filefish. Although scaled, some filefish have such small scales that they appear scaleless. Like the triggerfish, filefish have small gill openings and greatly elongated pelvic bones, creating a &quot;dewlap&quot; of skin running between the bone&#x27;s sharply keeled termination and the belly. The pelvis is articulated with other bones of the &quot;pelvic girdle&quot; and is capable of moving upwards and downwards in many species to form a large dewlap, which is used to make the fish appear much deeper in the body than is actually the case. Some filefish erect the dorsal spine and pelvis simultaneously to make it more difficult for a predator to remove them from a cave.

The largest filefish species is the scrawled filefish (&quot;Aluterus scriptus&quot;) at up to in length. Most species are less than in length. There is marked sexual dimorphism in some species, with the sexes possessing different coloration, different body shapes, and the males with larger caudal spines and bristles.

==Habitat and life history==
Adult filefish are generally shallow water fish, inhabiting depths of no more than about 30 metres. They may be found in lagoons or associated with seaward reefs and seagrass beds; some species may also enter estuaries. Some species are closely associated with dense mats of &quot;sargassum&quot;, a particularly ubiquitous &quot;sea weed&quot;; these filefish, notably the planehead filefish (&quot;Stephanolepis hispidus&quot;) are also coloured and patterned to match their weedy environments.

Either solitary, in pairs or small groups depending on the species, filefish are not terribly good swimmers; their small fins confine the fish to a sluggish gait. Filefish are often observed drifting head downward amongst stands of seaweed, presumably in an effort to fool both predator and prey alike. When threatened, filefish may retreat into crevices in the reef.

The feeding habits of filefish vary among the species, with some eating only algae and seagrass; others also eat small benthic invertebrates, such as tunicates, gorgonians, and hydrozoans; and some species eat corals (&quot;corallivores&quot;). It is the latter two habits which have largely precluded the introduction of filefish into the aquarium hobby.

Filefish spawn at bottom sites prepared and guarded by the males; both he and the female may guard the brood, or the male alone, depending on the species. The young filefish are pelagic; that is, they frequent open water. &quot;Sargassum&quot; provides a safe retreat for many species, both fish and weed being at the current&#x27;s mercy. Juvenile filefish are at risk from predation by tuna and dolphinfish.

==As food==

In FAO fisheries statistics, the largest category of filefish are &quot;Cantherhines&quot; spp. with annual landings around 200,000 tonnes in recent years, mostly by China. Landings of threadsail filefish &quot;(Stephanolepis cirrhifer)&quot; and smooth leatherjacket (&quot;Meuschenia scaber&quot;) are reported at species level, with the rest as &quot;Filefishes, leatherjackets nei&quot; (nei = not elsewhere included).

Threadsail filefish (&quot;Stephanolepis cirrhifer&quot;) is a popular snack food in Korea. It is typically dried and made into a sweet and salty jerky called &quot;jwipo&quot; (), which is then roasted before eating.

<text>The list of [[subcamp (SS)|subcamp]]s of Mittelbau identifies locations of Konzentrationslager () Mittelbau (&quot;Central Construction&quot;). The location of the KZ Mittelbau headquarters was originally only the Block 17/3 Buchenwald subcamp, but at the end of September 1944 the SS administration ordered the camp to become the center of a complex separate from the Buchenwald concentration camp. KZ Mittelbau became operational on November 1, 1944 with 32,471 prisoners.

<text>The Maine () is a river, a tributary of the Loire, long, in the Maine-et-Loire &quot;département&quot; in France.

It is formed by the confluence of the Mayenne and Sarthe rivers north of Angers. It flows through this city and joins the Loire southwest of Angers.

The river&#x27;s name is derived from the ancient &quot;Meodena&quot;, as is Mayenne, and is unrelated to Maine, the province.

<text>Afro-Cuban All Stars is a Cuban band led by Juan de Marcos González. Their music is a mix of all the styles of Cuban music, including bolero, chachachá, salsa, son montuno, timba, guajira, danzón, rumba and abakua.

They are known internationally for their 1997 album &quot;A Toda Cuba le Gusta&quot;, which was recorded at the Buena Vista Social Club sessions. Members have included Rubén González, Orlando &quot;Cachaíto&quot; López, Ibrahim Ferrer, Raúl Planas, Pío Leyva, Manuel &quot;Puntillita&quot; Licea, Félix Baloy, Yanko Pisaco and more recently Caridad Hierrezuelo and Pedro Calvo.

==History==
In early 1996 Nick Gold, head of World Circuit Records, invited Ry Cooder to participate in an experiment combining Cuban and African musicians. A group of Cuban musicians had already been assembled, including Rubén González as the pianist. However, since the African musicians had experienced difficulties in obtaining visas, the focus changed to recording Cuban music instead.

In March 1996, Gold and Juan de Marcos González (previously the tres player of Sierra Maestra) produced &quot;A Toda Cuba le Gusta&quot;, the first album by the Afro-Cuban All Stars. It was recorded at the EGREM Studios in Havana and featured Rubén González (piano), Orlando &quot;Cachaíto&quot; López (bass), and a big band of veteran Cuban musicians and singers, most of whom had careers that went back to the 1950s Havana scene: Ibrahim Ferrer, Pío Leyva, Manuel &#x27;Puntillita&#x27; Licea, Raúl Planas, Félix Baloy, and José Antonio &quot;Maceo&quot; Rodríguez. Cooder also played slide guitar on one track, &quot;Alto Songo&quot;. In the sleeve notes, de Marcos González, who directed the project and played tres, wrote: &quot;This album is dedicated to Rubén González, genius of Cuban piano&quot;.

During follow-on sessions also held at EGREM Studios in March 1996, Cooder then produced the Grammy winning &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot;, featuring Rubén González (piano), Compay Segundo, Ibrahim Ferrer, Omara Portuondo and Eliades Ochoa, supported by much of the same band that had recorded the Afro-Cuban All Stars album, and with Juan de Marcos González now acting as A &amp; R Consultant. Cooder played guitars on all but one track.

Finally, in April 1996 and using left over studio time after the sessions that had produced the previous two albums, the solo album &quot;Introducing...Rubén González&quot; was recorded in just two days, live with no overdubs. On the album&#x27;s outer cover, Cooder is quoted as saying: &quot;The greatest piano soloist I have ever heard in my entire life. A Cuban cross between Thelonious Monk and Felix the Cat&quot;. 
All three albums were released on Nick Gold&#x27;s World Circuit Records in 1997. In early 1998, Wim Wenders filmed a documentary entitled &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot;, and the entire group of Cuban artists became famous worldwide.

<text>The Australian Shepherd is a breed of herding dog from the United States. The name of the breed is technically a misnomer, as it was developed in California in the 19th century. It is believed to have its origins in sheepdog breeds from northwest Spain, as well as collies imported, alongside sheep, from Australia and New Zealand; the breed reportedly took its name from this trade. Originally used solely as a herding dog, the Australian Shepherd has become one of the most popular companion dog breeds in North America.

==History==

The Australian Shepherd descends in part from pastoral dogs brought to herd Spanish flocks in North America as early as the 1500s. There is some speculation that these dogs included the Carea Leonés, a mountain sheepdog that can display the eye color and merle coat found in many contemporary Australian Shepherds. It is sometimes claimed that the Basque Shepherd Dog and the Pyrenean Sheepdog were also among the ancestors of the breed. The breed as it is known today developed in California in the 19th century, as a sheep herding dog for Californian shepherds. The Australian Shepherd is also believed to be descended from a variety of herding dogs imported to California with imported sheep, including collies from Australia and New Zealand. It was from these ancestors that the breed took its name.

The Australian Shepherd spread from California throughout the Western United States where it became extremely popular with ranchers who valued the breed&#x27;s sheep working qualities, as well as their ability to handle cattle and other livestock. A purely working breed for over a century, the Australian Shepherd was virtually unknown outside of the livestock industry until the mid-20th century when the breed was popularised by Jay Sisler, a rodeo performer, at rodeos across the western states with his Australian Shepherds performing all manner of tricks. A breed club was soon formed to promote the breed, the Australian Shepherd Club of America, and kennel club recognition followed in 1979 when the breed was recognised by the United Kennel Club. The breed was subsequently recognised by the American Kennel Club in the 1990s and later the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.

From the late-20th century the Australian Shepherd has increasingly been seen in conformation shows and it has become an extremely popular companion dog. In 2019 it was ranked by the American Kennel Club as the 15th most popular breed of dog in the United States.

==Description==
===Appearance===

The Australian Shepherd is a medium-sized, athletic breed; they typically stand between and weigh between . The parent club, the Australian Shepherd Club of America&#x27;s breed standard states male dogs should stand between and females between , at the withers; the standard does allow individual animals to exceed these limits slightly.

The Australian Shepherd has a moderately long and wavy double coat that has a dense undercoat and coarse topcoat; the coat is short on the face and well feathered on the rear of the legs. The breed is known for its unique colorations and variable coat patterns, it being said no two dogs sharing a coat. The breed standard allows for blue merle, red merle, solid black or solid red, with or without white markings and with or without tan points.

Examples of the breed can be born with long or naturally bobbed (short) tails; traditionally long tailed dogs had their tails docked, although some countries outside of the United States do not allow docking and so some long tailed and partial bob tails are allowed to be exhibited in those countries.

===Temperament===
The Australian Shepherd is described as intelligent, active, loyal, protective, playful, and adaptive. The modern breed is predominantly bred for pets; despite this, many retain a strong herding instinct and it is not uncommon for companion dogs of the breed to try to herd children or other pets. A very active breed, the Australian Shepherd is known to become destructive if it does not receive adequate exercise.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a median life expectancy of 13.7 years based on a sample of 62 deaths, which was above the median of 12.7 years for purebreeds and 12 years for crossbreeds.

Based on a sample of 48 still-living dogs, the most common health concerns noted by owners were eye problems (red eye, epiphora, conjunctivitis, and cataracts). Dermatological and respiratory problems also ranked high.

The Australian Shepherd is one of the more commonly affected breeds for an autosomal recessive mutation of the MDR1 gene. This mutation causes greater sensitivity to certain drugs at normally safe doses, including ivermectin. A test is available to determine if a particular dog carries the mutated gene.

Australian Shepherds show relatively low levels (approximately 6%) of hip dysplasia, a heritable condition where the femur does not fit securely in the pelvic socket of the hip joint.

The Australian Shepherd is one of the breeds more commonly affected by hereditary cataracts.

===Double merle===

Double merles often have excessive light or white areas and can have hearing and vision problems as a result of having two copies of the merle gene. Homozygous merles can be deaf or blind, or express iris colobomas, retinal detachment, cataracts, persistent pupillary membrane, a displacement of the lens, equatorial staphyloma, night blindness and microphthalmia. Audio impairment or deafness usually develops after the birth of a puppy with their ear canal still closed. The white color of double merles is produced due to the lack of melanocytes which provide high potassium levels in the endolymph surrounding the cochlea&#x27;s hair cells. There is no surgery or treatment that can reduce the damage. Loss of hearing is directly linked to the amount of pigmentation cells a dog has. The same pigment that is lacking in the ear can also be lacking in the eyes, affecting its development. Although many believe that only dogs with blue eyes have eye problems, it is not correct. Due to the contrast between eye problems and blue eyes, eye conditions in blue-eyed dogs are much easier to spot.

The term &quot;lethal white&quot; originated from horses born with lethal white syndrome, and has since evolved to often describe dogs born with the double merle trait. This trait is found in many breeds, but most commonly found in Australian Shepherds. The name &quot;lethal white&quot; is a misnomer, as this genetic condition is not lethal to the dogs; it is often the breeder who is lethal to the pups by culling them immediately after birth. Many consider the term &quot;lethal white&quot; to be derogatory.

==Activities==
Like other herding breeds, these dogs excel at many dog sports, especially herding also known as stockdog, dog agility, dock diving/dock jumping, obedience, rally, tracking, disc, and flyball. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive instinct tests. Australian Shepherds that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in ASCA stock dog trials or AKC herding events.

The dog has a stride in which its front and back legs cross over, making for an appearance of &quot;on the edge&quot; speed. The dogs instinctively use a &quot;pounce&quot; position to deal with cattle trying to kick them. They also have strong hips and legs, allowing for fast acceleration and high jumping, sometimes as high as 4 ft (1.3 m).

An Australian shepherd named Pockets is credited as being the oldest dog to earn a title in AKC history, having earned the Rally Novice title at the age of 15 years, 5 weeks.

<text>Zydeco Force was an American Creole zydeco band from Opelousas, Louisiana, United States. Zydeco Force is best known for its tracks &quot;Hey Madeline&quot; and &quot;B-Flat&quot;.

==History==
The band consisted of Robby Robinson, Raymond Thomas, and the two sons of Lawtell Playboys frontman Delton Broussard: Shelton and Jeffery Broussard, and Delton&#x27;s nephew Herbert Broussard. They formed in 1989 and became a regional hit across Louisiana and East Texas. The band was featured in the award-winning German film, &quot;Schultze Gets the Blues&quot;, filmed in the former East Germany and in Texas and Louisiana.

Jeffery Broussard has his own band, Jeffery Broussard &amp; The Creole Cowboys. They have performed worldwide, and appeared at the Augusta Heritage Festival, in Elkins, West Virginia, during Augusta&#x27;s Cajun/Zydeco week in various years, as well as New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival. They continue to perform for many other festivals and live venues from coast to coast.

<text>The following is a list of [[subcamp (SS)|subcamp]]s of the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] established by Nazi Germany. The main camp, with around 50 barracks for slave-labour prisoners, was located from Berlin, and operated between 1938 and April 22, 1945. During World War II the prisoners included Germans, Poles, Soviet POWs, Roma, and later Jews. It is estimated that the number of victims of Sachsenhausen was 30,00035,000. Dozens of subcamps of Sachsenhausen existed directly in the capital city, serving individual business operators and factories.

<doc id="514832" wikidata="Q821007" url="?curid=514832" title="Berlekamp–Massey algorithm">
<text>The Berlekamp–Massey algorithm is an algorithm that will find the shortest linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) for a given binary output sequence. The algorithm will also find the minimal polynomial of a linearly recurrent sequence in an arbitrary field. The field requirement means that the Berlekamp–Massey algorithm requires all non-zero elements to have a multiplicative inverse. Reeds and Sloane offer an extension to handle a ring.

Elwyn Berlekamp invented an algorithm for decoding Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem (BCH) codes. James Massey recognized its application to linear feedback shift registers and simplified the algorithm. Massey termed the algorithm the LFSR Synthesis Algorithm (Berlekamp Iterative Algorithm), but it is now known as the Berlekamp–Massey algorithm.

==Description of algorithm==
The Berlekamp–Massey algorithm is an alternative to the Reed–Solomon Peterson decoder for solving the set of linear equations. It can be summarized as finding the coefficients Λ&quot;j&quot; of a polynomial Λ(&quot;x&quot;) so that for all positions &quot;i&quot; in an input stream &quot;S&quot;:

:formula_1

In the code examples below, &quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a potential instance of &quot;Λ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). The error locator polynomial &quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for &quot;L&quot; errors is defined as:

:formula_2

or reversed:

:formula_3

The goal of the algorithm is to determine the minimal degree &quot;L&quot; and &quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) which results in all syndromes
:formula_4
being equal to 0:
:formula_5

Algorithm:
&quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is initialized to 1, &quot;L&quot; is the current number of assumed errors, and initialized to zero. &quot;N&quot; is the total number of syndromes. &quot;n&quot; is used as the main iterator and to index the syndromes from 0 to &quot;N&quot;−1. &quot;B&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a copy of the last &quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) since &quot;L&quot; was updated and initialized to 1. &quot;b&quot; is a copy of the last discrepancy &quot;d&quot; (explained below) since &quot;L&quot; was updated and initialized to 1. &quot;m&quot; is the number of iterations since &quot;L&quot;, &quot;B&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), and &quot;b&quot; were updated and initialized to 1.

Each iteration of the algorithm calculates a discrepancy &quot;d&quot;. At iteration &quot;k&quot; this would be:

:formula_6

If &quot;d&quot; is zero, the algorithm assumes that &quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;L&quot; are correct for the moment, increments &quot;m&quot;, and continues.

If &quot;d&quot; is not zero, the algorithm adjusts &quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) so that a recalculation of &quot;d&quot; would be zero:

:formula_7

The &quot;xm&quot; term &quot;shifts&quot; B(x) so it follows the syndromes corresponding to &quot;b&quot;. If the previous update of &quot;L&quot; occurred on iteration &quot;j&quot;, then &quot;m&quot; = &quot;k&quot; − &quot;j&quot;, and a recalculated discrepancy would be:

:formula_8

This would change a recalculated discrepancy to:

:formula_9

The algorithm also needs to increase &quot;L&quot; (number of errors) as needed. If &quot;L&quot; equals the actual number of errors, then during the iteration process, the discrepancies will become zero before &quot;n&quot; becomes greater than or equal to 2&quot;L&quot;. Otherwise &quot;L&quot; is updated and the algorithm will update &quot;B&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), &quot;b&quot;, increase &quot;L&quot;, and reset &quot;m&quot; = 1. The formula &quot;L&quot; = (&quot;n&quot; + 1 − &quot;L&quot;) limits &quot;L&quot; to the number of available syndromes used to calculate discrepancies, and also handles the case where &quot;L&quot; increases by more than 1.

== Pseudocode ==

The algorithm from for an arbitrary field:

 polynomial(field &quot;K&quot;) s(x) = ... /* coeffs are sj; output sequence as N-1 degree polynomial) */
 /* connection polynomial */
 polynomial(field K) C(x) = 1; /* coeffs are cj */
 polynomial(field K) B(x) = 1;
 int L = 0;
 int m = 1;
 field K b = 1;
 int n;
 /* steps 2. and 6. */
 for (n = 0; n &lt; N; n++) {
 /* step 2. calculate discrepancy */
 field K d = sn + 
 if (d == 0) {
 /* step 3. discrepancy is zero; annihilation continues */
 m = m + 1;
 } else if (2 * L &lt;= n) {
 /* step 5. */
 /* temporary copy of C(x) */
 polynomial(field K) T(x) = C(x);
 C(x) = C(x) - d b-1 xm B(x);
 L = n + 1 - L;
 B(x) = T(x);
 b = d;
 m = 1;
 } else {
 /* step 4. */
 C(x) = C(x) - d b-1 xm B(x);
 m = m + 1;
 }
 return L;

In the case of binary GF(2) BCH code, the discrepancy d will be zero on all odd steps, so a check can be added to avoid calculating it.
 for (n = 0; n &lt; N; n++) {
 /* if odd step number, discrepancy == 0, no need to calculate it */
 if ((n&amp;1) != 0) {
 m = m + 1;
 continue;
 /* ... */

<text>Perry Miller (born November 22, 1941), known professionally as Jesse Colin Young, is an American singer and songwriter. He was a founding member and lead singer of the 1960s group the Youngbloods. After their dissolution in 1972, Young embarked on a solo career, releasing a series of albums through Warner Bros. Records, including &quot;Song for Juli&quot; (1973), &quot;Light Shine&quot; (1974), &quot;Songbird&quot; (1975) and the live album &quot;On the Road&quot; (1976). Young continued to release music in the 1980s with Elektra Records and Cypress Records, before deciding to release music through his personal label, Ridgetop Music, in 1993. After the Mount Vision Fire in 1995, Young relocated with his family to a coffee plantation in Hawaii, periodically releasing music. Young received a diagnosis of &quot;chronic Lyme disease&quot; in 2012, and decided to retire from music. He began performing again in 2016 with his son Tristan, releasing a new album &quot;Dreamers&quot; in 2019 through BMG.

Young&#x27;s song &quot;Sunlight&quot; was covered by Three Dog Night on their album &quot;Naturally&quot; (1970), and “Darkness, Darkness” by Robert Plant in 2002, which received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance.

==Early life==

Perry Miller was born and raised in Queens, New York, to musical parents both originally from Lynn, Massachusetts. His mother was a violinist and singer with perfect pitch, while his father was a Harvard educated accountant. Both of his parents had a passion for classical music, and encouraged Young to play, and he learned piano from a young age. In 1959, Young won a scholarship to attend Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where he studied classical guitar; however, he was expelled from the strict academy. After finishing high school, Young enrolled in Ohio State University, where he broadened his musical tastes by living behind a record store. After a semester, Young returned to his parents&#x27; home in Pennsylvania, later transferring to New York University in 1961. Young balanced his studies with performances in Greenwich Village; however, he later decided to leave college and become a full-time musician. During this period, he decided on his stage name Jesse Colin Young as a blend of the names of outlaws Jesse James and Cole Younger, and Formula One design engineer and team owner Colin Chapman, as he felt like this was a more appropriate name for the music he performed.

Young met producer Bobby Scott in the early 1960s, who assisted Young in getting studio time. Young&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Soul of a City Boy&quot;, was released in 1964, the result of a four hour recording session backed by an acoustic guitar. Young&#x27;s cover of the George Remaily song &quot;Four in the Morning&quot; received some radio airplay, and in 1965 Young released a second album produced by Scott, &quot;Young Blood&quot;.

==The Youngbloods==
Young met guitarist Jerry Corbitt, a folk singer from Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the pair decided to form a band as a duo called the Youngbloods (named after Young&#x27;s sophomore album), touring Canada together. Eventually Corbitt&#x27;s friend Lowell &quot;Banana&quot; Levinger (guitar and electric piano) and drummer Joe Bauer were added to the band, and the group became the house band for the Greenwich Village night club Cafe Au Go Go. During this period, Young switched from performing guitar to performing bass, as the band already had two guitar players. Signing to RCA Records, the band released their debut single &quot;Grizzly Bear&quot; in 1966, and their debut album &quot;The Youngbloods&quot; in 1967. The group&#x27;s first album contained the song &quot;Get Together&quot;, written by Chet Powers, and was released as a single in 1967 to moderate success; however, after its use in a public service commercial for the National Council of Christians and Jews was released in 1969, it became an international hit for the band. Few of the band&#x27;s early songs were written by Young: only &quot;Tears Are Falling&quot; and &quot;Foolin&#x27; Around (The Waltz)&quot; from their debut album, and four on their Felix Pappalardi-produced follow up album &quot;Earth Music&quot; (1967) (however the B-sides of both issues of &quot;Get Together&quot; featured songs written by Young).

During the production stages of the band&#x27;s third album, the Charlie Daniels-produced &quot;Elephant Mountain&quot; (1969) when the band relocated from New York to California, Corbitt left the band, and Young became the group&#x27;s main songwriter. The Young-penned singles from the album, &quot;Sunlight&quot; and &quot;Darkness, Darkness&quot;, both became hit singles. &quot;Sunlight&quot; was covered the next year by Three Dog Night on their album &quot;Naturally&quot; (1970). The band formed their own imprint with Warner Bros. Records, Racoon Records, on which they began releasing music in the 1970s.

==Return to solo career==

In 1970, Young built a recording studio next to his home in Inverness, California, where he began recording his solo album &quot;Together&quot;, released in 1972 through Warner Bros. Records. Due to the album&#x27;s success, Young disbanded the Youngbloods after their final album in November 1972, &quot;High on a Ridge Top&quot;. Young&#x27;s fourth solo album, &quot;Song for Juli&quot; (1973), was a sleeper hit, staying on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for almost a year. Young toured his fifth album, &quot;Light Shine&quot; (1974), as an opening act for Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. Young&#x27;s third Warner album, &quot;Songbird&quot; (1975), was his highest charting album (reaching number 26 in the US and number 20 in Canada), and his further Warner releases, the live album &quot;On the Road&quot; (1976) and &quot;Love on the Wing&quot; (1977), all charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 200 albums chart.

In 1978, Young switched labels to Elektra Records, releasing &quot;American Dreams&quot; (1978), and in 1979 performed as a part of the &quot;No Nukes&quot; protest concerts organized by Musicians United for Safe Energy. Young&#x27;s follow up on Elektra, &quot;The Perfect Stranger&quot; (1982) and a further album on Cypress Records entitled &quot;The Highway Is for Heroes&quot; (1987) did not meet with as much commercial success as his previous works.

In 1993, Young and his wife Connie founded Ridgetop Music, a label based out of their home in Inverness, in order to re-release Young&#x27;s 1970s catalog on CD, and as an outlet to release new music. On the label, Young released his albums &quot;Makin&#x27; It Real&quot; (1993), &quot;Swept Away&quot; (1994) and the compilation album &quot;Crazy Boy&quot; (1995). Young&#x27;s house in Inverness was destroyed in the Mount Vision fire in October 1995, after which the family relocated to the Kona Coffee Belt of the Big Island of Hawaii, moving into a coffee farm that Young had purchased in 1987. 

Young released the album &quot;Walk the Talk&quot; in 2001 independently, collaborating with his son Cheyenne Young, godson Ethan Turner, and former Youngbloods member Lowell &quot;Banana&quot; Levinger. followed by &quot;Songs for Christmas&quot; in 2002, released as a part of a CD re-release project with Liquid 8 Records. Young&#x27;s song &quot;Darkness, Darkness&quot; was covered by Robert Plant in 2002, which received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance. In 2004, Young released the Hawaii-influenced album &quot;Living in Paradise&quot; with Artemis Records.

Young quit performing music in 2012, at the time when he was diagnosed with &quot;chronic Lyme disease&quot;. He was inspired to start performing again in 2016, after being impressed by the musicians at his son&#x27;s graduation recital at the Berklee College of Music, and asked his son to put together a band of his classmates to perform at Young&#x27;s performance at SXSW. After touring for a year, Young recorded a new solo record with the band, &quot;Dreamers&quot;, which was released in February 2019.

== Influences ==

Jesse Colin Young was influenced musically by country blues musicians Mississippi John Hurt and Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, blues musician T-Bone Walker and folk singer Pete Seeger.

== Personal life ==

Young was originally married to Suzi Young, with whom he had two children: Juli (born 1966) and Cheyenne. Young&#x27;s song &quot;Song for Juli&quot; was co-written with Suzi about Juli, while Young wrote “Morning Sun&quot; from &quot;Song for Juli&quot; (1973) after the birth of his son Cheyenne. In 1967, Young and his Youngbloods bandmates moved to Marin County, California, and in 1971 he built a house on a ridgetop in Inverness, California. The recording studio at Young&#x27;s Inverness property, built by Young in 1972, was untouched by the 1995 forest fire, and is currently used as a recording studio by his son Cheyenne&#x27;s band Beso Negro.

Young met his current wife, Connie Darden-Young, in the 1980s. Together they have two children, Tristan and Jazzie. Tristan graduated from the Berklee College of Music in 2016. He currently tours with his father as a member of his back-up band, and co-produced Young&#x27;s album &quot;Dreamers&quot; (2019). Jazzie (born 1994) https://www.jazzieyoung.com/ is an independent musician, who began releasing music independently in 2017.

In 2006, Young and his family moved to Aiken, South Carolina, which is the hometown of his wife, Connie Young.

Three of Young&#x27;s children also play bass guitar.

<text>Chinatown is a neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago, along S. Wentworth Avenue between Cermak Road and W. 26th St. Over a third of Chicago&#x27;s Chinese population resides in this ethnic enclave, making it one of the largest concentrations of Chinese-Americans in the United States. It formed around 1912, after settlers moved south from near the Loop, where the first enclaves were established in the 19th century.

Chinatown is sometimes confused with an area on the city&#x27;s North Side, &quot;New Chinatown&quot;, which is largely populated by people of Southeast Asian heritage.

Looking to escape the anti-Chinese violence that had broken out on the west coast, the first Chinese people arrived in Chicago after 1869 when the First transcontinental railroad was completed. Aside from ethnic violence, governments on the west coast had begun to systematically target Chinese people, such as a 1870 San Francisco ordinance that taxed laundrymen who used horseless wagons for their deliveries. This discrimination on the west coast, in tandem with poor economic conditions at the time, led to intense Chinese migration to other areas of the United States. Further aiding this rapid migration was the fact that many Chinese people lost their jobs after the completion of the transcontinental railroad, as they had made up 90% of the workforce for the Central Pacific Railroad.

At first, Chinese people in Chicago were largely welcomed by their fellow Chicagoans of all races. As early immigrant Moy Dong Chow would later state, &quot;the Chicagoans found us a peculiar people to be sure, but they liked to mix with us.&quot; The willingness of Chinese Chicagoans to accept Christian missions in Chinatown also helped to ease tensions between the two groups. By 1909, there were two Christian missions in old Chinatown, and eight other missions dedicated to serving ethnic Chinese by 1909.

This acceptance led to a prospering early Chinese community in Chicago. By the late 1800s, 25% of Chicago&#x27;s approximately 600 Chinese residents settled along Clark Street between Van Buren and Harrison Streets in Chicago&#x27;s Loop. In the mid-1870s, the Kim Kee Company opened a store selling imported Chinese goods and ingredients, and in the basement of the same building stood a Chinese-owned restaurant. In 1889, 16 Chinese-owned businesses were located along the two-block stretch, including eight grocery stores, two butcher shops and a restaurant. Other businesses operated in the early Chinatown included gambling houses, headquarters of family associations, and Christian mission houses. Further, grocery stores in Chinatown could double as a cultural center, where people would gamble, consume rice wine, and smoke cigars. Laundry services were also quite important to the average working Chinese man in the original Chinatown, with 198 Chinese laundries by 1883. However, by 1897, white Chicagoans had begun to open laundry businesses as well. Many white laundrymen offered their services cheaper than the Chinese laundrymen, causing the leaders of Chinatown to declare &quot;war&quot; on the &quot;cheap foreign labor&quot; that was hurting Chinese laundry businesses in the area. By 1903, white Chicagoans also became highly interested in the increasingly popular &quot;fad&quot; of chop suey restaurants in Chinatown, with the cuisine developing a &quot;mysterious&quot; aura among whites. This helped lead to the opening of more restaurants on Clark Street.

By the turn of the century, numerous powerful clans and family associations rose up among the Chinese population in Chicago. The first and most powerful was the Moy clan, who were the de facto leaders of the Chinese people in Chicago, and, even from this earlier period of migration, the Moy Family Association came to be the largest association in the city. From 1898 to 1940, there were over six thousand immigrant files in Chicago, and over one thousand of these files contained the name &quot;Moy&quot;. Sam Moy was the first &quot;mayor&quot; of Chinatown, and he acted as an interpreter and interacted with city officials on behalf of the area. Besides the Moy clan, other major clans in early Chinatown were the Wong and Chin clans. The prevalence of just a few surnames reflects the phenomenon of chain migration and the continuing propensity of transnational ties that existed early on within Chinatown.

Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Chinese Americans arrived in Chicago in droves and were vehemently supported by the city&#x27;s Chinese residents, largely due to the preexisting clan associations who sought to take care of their kinsmen. The importance of clan ties for finding success in Chinatown continued for decades, with many clans financing businesses through fellow members of their family association or strictly hiring kinsmen to work in their businesses. The Chinese population more than doubled from 1890 to 1900, with many of these new migrants residing in the original Chinatown. In terms of ties to mainland China, the large majority of the early Chinese people in Chicago were from Taishan, such as influential merchants Chin Foin and Moy Dong Chow.

Old Chinatown, like other highly-populated Chinatowns in cities across the country, was a major site of the Tong Wars, and there were several high profile incidents related to these wars throughout early Chinatown&#x27;s history. In 1909, a large shootout broke out between different Tongs, leading to mass arrests. Later, in 1911 Lee Yip Wing and Moy Dong Tong were shot for failing to comply with demands by the Hip Sing Tong. The Tong Wars would continue for the next several decades, with Chicago and Chinatown constantly preparing for another outbreak of violence. For example, in 1930 extra police details were sent to Chinatown after a truce was called off between the warring parties.

=== Relocation South ===

While Chinese people in Chicago had been relatively welcomed by the locals in the past, the renewal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1892, in tandem with the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, brought a significant amount of discrimination to the Chinese population. Because of this, in 1912, Chinese people living in this area began moving south to Armour Square, with about half of all Chinese people moving out of Clark Street into the South Side by this time. Some historians say this was due to increasing rent prices, as rents were significantly higher for Chinese businesses than similar white businesses. Others see more complex causes: discrimination, overcrowding, a high non-Chinese crime rate, and disagreements between the two associations (&quot;tongs&quot;) within the community, the Hip Sing Tong and the On Leong Tong. Largely, however, the move was a result of multiple factors including racial prejudice, cultural bias, and economic competition. One such example of racial prejudice was incited by the murder of Elsie Sigel in New York City by a supposedly Chinese man, which made white residents in Chicago suspicious of the close relationship between white women and Chinese men in their own city. Yet another factor that precipitated the move further south was the impending construction of a federal building in the heart of the old Chinatown in 1911, which would require many Chinese-owned buildings to be demolished. By 1911, prominent Chinese men in Chicago were already negotiating with property holders about moving two miles south.
In response to this, the move to the new South Side Chinatown was led by the On Leong Merchants Association who, in 1912, had a building constructed along Cermak Road (then 22nd Street) that could house 15 stores, 30 apartments and the Association&#x27;s headquarters. While the building&#x27;s design was typical of the period, it also featured Chinese accents such as tile trim adorned with dragons. The total cost of the building was $200,000. In addition, the On Leong Merchants Association purchased a series of ten year leases to develop the surrounding area. Thus, starting in 1912, the area near Wentworth Avenue and Cermak Road was officially proclaimed the &quot;New Chinatown&quot;. Even in the first year of this move south, Chinese people in the new Chinatown faced significant discrimination from the established Italian community in Armor Square, causing them to restrict the new Chinatown to just one square block at 22nd Street and Princeton Avenue. This discrimination was a continuation of tensions that were present before the move south, when non-Chinese residents fearing a &quot;yellow invasion&quot; sought to block Chinese people buying property in Armour Square.

The new Chinatown would come to hold over one-third of Chicago&#x27;s two thousand strong Chinese population soon after its founding. Politically, many in new Chinatown were united in their strong support of the Republic of China. In 1919, a visit to Chinatown by Wang Chen Wei, the right hand man of the Republic’s first president Sun Yat-sen, produced a large parade with many Republican banners flying. As new Chinatown grew significantly, the old Chinatown was left largely empty of ethnic Chinese inhabitants. According to one contemporary journalist, by 1927 there were a hundred &quot;for rent&quot; signs on the windows of the old Chinatown, with only two Chinese businesses remaining.
In the 1920s, Chinese community leaders secured approximately 50 ten-year leases on properties in the newly developing Chinatown. Because of severe racial discrimination, these leases needed to be secured via an intermediary, H. O. Stone Company. Jim Moy, then-director of the On Leong Merchants Association, then decided that a Chinese-style building should be constructed as a strong visual announcement of the Chinese community&#x27;s new presence in the area. With no Chinese-born architects in Chicago at the time, Chicago-born Norse architects Christian S. Michaelsen and Sigurd A. Rognstad were asked to design the new On Leong Merchants Association Building in spring 1926. Michaelsen and Rognstad drew their final design after studying texts on Chinese architecture. When the building opened in 1928 at a cost of a million dollars, it was the finest large Chinese-style structure in any North American Chinatown. While the overall structure of the building was fairly commonplace for the time, it was marked with two massive pagoda towers to frame it. The On Leong Association allowed the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association to put its headquarters in the new building and also used it as an immigrant assistance center, a school, a shrine, a meeting hall, and office space for the Association itself. It was often informally referred to as Chinatown&#x27;s &quot;city hall&quot;. 

Economically, by the 1930s, a large portion of Chinese businesses in the new Chinatown were large grocery stores stocking imported goods. Through transnational associations, these initial Chinese-owned stores substantiated a strong link between Chicago&#x27;s Chinatown, other Chinatowns in the United States, and even East Asia itself. For example, the Moy-owned Hip Lung Yee Kee company on Wentworth Avenue facilitated communication between associations in San Francisco, Chicago, and Hong Kong. The grocery stores in Chinatown at this time also had a very important role locally. They employed over six hundred Chinese locals, and they functioned as hotels and banks as well. Otherwise, Chinese restaurants were supremely important to the economy of Chinatown in this period. By 1930, there were at least eleven restaurants located in the new Chinatown. Often, these restaurants were places of fine dining, and, because of this, they also acted as gathering places to connect Chinatown’s elites with the elites of Chicago in general. For example, Mong Long Fo&#x27;s restaurant was the site of a publicized meeting between two members of the Moy clan and three of Chicago&#x27;s white elite. Overall, however, the economic situation for many Chinese people in the new Chinatown remained the same as in the old Chinatown. The majority of Chinatown&#x27;s residents were poorly-educated immigrants who made their livings through low-skill, manual labor or through restaurant-related work. In turn, the wealthy merchant families still wielded immense power in the area, with the Moys wielding the most.

Numerous important buildings and structures in Chinatown arose in the area during this early period. The Canal Street railroad bridge, built in 1914, remains a tall vertical structure in the backdrop of Chinatown. The Hung Mun building in Chicago was and is still inhabited by the Chicago branch of the Hung Mun Association. While it only occupied the building starting in the 1920s, the local branch of the association played an active role in the 1911 revolution that founded the Chinese Republic. The Won Kow Building was built from 1926–1927 by the same architects that designed the On Leong Merchant Association Building. As can be expected, it shares many of the same design characteristics as the former building, and it has since housed a restaurant in the building that is the oldest restaurant in Chinatown. Finally, reflecting the prominence of the Moy clan once again, the Moy Association Building still stands as one of the more impressive and beautiful buildings in Chinatown. It was originally built in 1928 and added onto in 1932. Like the On Leong Merchant Association Building and the Won Kow Building, the Moy Association building was designed by Michaelsen and Rognstad.

=== Post-World War II Chinatown ===

Before World War II, Chicago&#x27;s Chinatown remained a largely insulated enclave, with little of the racial mixing seen in cities such as New York City. The residents only grew closer together from the war as they collectively united against fascism. However, this unity increasingly became frayed in the years that followed. The influx of refugees and educated Chinese people into Chicago dramatically changed the importance of Chinatown to Chicago&#x27;s Chinese residents. Instead of living and working in Chinatown, many newcomers decided to move to the suburbs. Further, as Chinese immigration came to be more accepted following the passing of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, young, educated Chinese Americans began to take a greater role in Chinatown, clashing with the old family associations.

In an effort to improve connectivity between Chinese residents throughout the city, construction began on the Chinatown Gateway in 1975, meant to act as a symbol of unity and encourage greater cultural exchange between Chinese communities. During the late 1980s, a group of Chinatown business leaders bought of property north of Archer Avenue from the Santa Fe Railway and built Chinatown Square, a two-level mall consisting of restaurants, beauty salons and law offices, flanked by 21 new townhouses. Additional residential construction, such as the Santa Fe Gardens, a 600-unit village of townhouses, condominiums and single-family homes was developed on formerly industrial land to the north. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the new addition was the creation of Ping Tom Memorial Park in 1999; located on the bank of the Chicago River, the park features a Chinese-style pavilion that many consider to be the most beautiful in the Midwest.

==Commerce==
Chicago&#x27;s Chinatown is home to a number of banks, Chinese restaurants, gift shops, grocery stores, Chinese medicine stores, as well as a number of services that cater to people interested in Chinese culture, including those speaking varieties of Chinese, especially Cantonese. It is a community hub for Chinese people in the Chicago metropolitan area, a business center for Chinese people in the Midwest, as well as a popular destination for tourists and locals alike.

==Demographics==
In 1990, about 10,000 Chinese people lived in Chinatown&#x27;s business district and the area south of 26th Street; several Italian Americans still remained in the neighborhood.

, about 8,000 people lived within Chinatown itself, and 90% were ethnic Chinese. As of that year, many of the residents were elderly.

In 2010, about 16,325 people lived within Chinatown.

As opposed to Chinatown communities in major cities like New York and San Francisco, which have suffered from gentrification, Chicago&#x27;s Chinatown has maintained healthy growth, with the 60608, 60609, and 60616 zip codes continually seeing increases in the population of residents identifying as Asian alone.

==Education==

===Primary and secondary schools===

Residents are zoned to schools in the Chicago Public Schools including John C. Haines School () and Phillips Academy High School.

Haines, which had its current facility built in 1994, serves students from Chinatown and formerly from the Harold L. Ickes Homes; students from the latter used a tunnel to get to school. 70% of the students were Asian while 28% were black; most residents of Ickes were black. Connie Laureman of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; stated that Haines, in 1990, was &quot;crowded and dilapidated&quot;. Until Gandy Easton became principal in 1990, the school had de facto racial segregation as ethnic Chinese students stayed in a bilingual program while black students took regular classes. Easton combined the two levels together, despite protests from ethnic Chinese parents. By 2001 school authorities instituted programs to combat racism and ensure Chinese and black students socialized with one another.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago supports the St. Therese Chinese Catholic School (), a K-8 private Catholic school, which has one of its two campuses in Chinatown. It was established in 1941. In 1990, almost all of the students were ethnic Chinese.

The Pui Tak Christian School () is a private pre-kindergarten to 8th grade school.

===Public libraries===

The Chicago Public Library operates the Chinatown Library at 2100 South Wentworth Avenue.

==Culture==

A 1942 article from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; stated that the strong family ties among the residents of Chinatown meant that there was little juvenile delinquency present in the community.

Chicago Chinatown celebrates the founding of the Republic of China with the Double Ten Parade, which includes lion dances and much display of the flag of Taiwan.

Chicago Chinatown also celebrates the National Day of the People&#x27;s Republic of China with members of the PRC consulate.

==Transportation==
The Dan Ryan Expressway and the Stevenson Expressway intersect over the southside of Chinatown. The Stevenson&#x27;s exit 293A (northbound exit and southbound entrances) gives Chinatown commuters immediate access to the expressways via Cermak Road, only one block east of Wentworth Avenue. There is metered street parking throughout the area, as well as two pay parking lots located on Wentworth Avenue.

Several forms of public transportation are also available in Chinatown. The Chicago Transit Authority operates both an elevated train and four bus routes that service the area. The Red Line, the CTA&#x27;s busiest transit route, stops 24/7 at the Cermak–Chinatown station located in the heart of Chinatown near the corner of Cermak Road and Wentworth Avenue. Running north–south, the #24 bus route runs on Wentworth Avenue on the eastside of Chinatown, while the #44 route runs on Canal Street on the westside. The #21 runs east–west on Cermak Road, and the #62 runs southwest–northeast on Archer Avenue. There is a taxicab stand on Wentworth Avenue, and a water taxi service also runs along the Chicago River from Michigan Avenue to Ping Tom Memorial Park in Chinatown during the summer months.

<text>Kang Sheng (; 4 November 1898 – 16 December 1975), born Zhang Zongke (), was a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) official, best known for having overseen the work of the CCP&#x27;s internal security and intelligence apparatus during the early 1940s and again at the height of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

A member of the CCP from the early 1920s, he spent time in Moscow during the early 1930s, where he learned the methods of the Soviet NKVD and became a supporter of Wang Ming for leadership of the CCP. After returning to China in the late 1930s, Kang Sheng switched his allegiance to Mao Zedong and became a close associate of Mao during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese Civil War, and after. He remained at or near the pinnacle of power in the People&#x27;s Republic of China from its establishment in 1949 until his death in 1975. After the death of Mao and the subsequent arrest of the Gang of Four, Kang Sheng was accused of sharing responsibility with the Gang for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution and in 1980 he was expelled posthumously from the CCP.

==Early life==
Kang Sheng was born in Dataizhuang (大臺莊, administered under Jiaonan County since 1946), Zhucheng County to the northwest of Qingdao in Shandong Province to a landowning family, some of whom had been Confucian scholars. Kang was born Zhang Zongke but he adopted a number of pseudonyms—most notably Zhao Rong, but also (for his painting) Li Jushi—before settling on Kang Sheng in the 1930s. Some sources give his year of birth as being as early as 1893, but it has also been variously given as 1898, 1899 and 1903.

Kang received his elementary education at the Guanhai school for boys and later at the German School in Qingdao. As a teenager, he entered into an arranged marriage with Chen Yi, in 1915, with whom he had two children, a daughter, Zhang Yuying, and a son, Zhang Zishi. After graduating from the German School, Kang taught in a rural school in Zhucheng, Shandong in the early 1920s before leaving, possibly for a sojourn in Germany and France, and ultimately for Shanghai, where he arrived in 1924.

==Shanghai==
After arriving in Shanghai, Kang enrolled in Shanghai University, an institution under the control of the CCP and the intellectual leadership of Qu Qiubai. After about six months at the university, he joined the Communist Party Youth League. Kang then joined the Party itself.

At the direction of the Party, Kang worked underground as a labor organizer. He helped organize the February 1925 strike against Japanese companies that culminated in the May 30th Movement, a huge Communist-led demonstration, and brought Kang into close contact with Party leaders Liu Shaoqi, Li Lisan and Zhang Guotao. Kang participated in the March 1927 worker&#x27;s insurrection alongside Gu Shunzhang and under the leadership of Zhao Shiyan, Luo Yinong, Wang Shouhua and Zhou Enlai. When the uprising was put down by the Kuomintang with the crucial assistance of Du Yuesheng&#x27;s Green Gang in the Shanghai massacre of April 12, 1927, Kang was able to escape into hiding.

Also in 1927, Kang married a Shanghai University student and fellow Shandong native, (born Cao Shuqing), who was to become a lifelong political ally. He entered the employment of Yu Qiaqing, a wealthy businessman with strong Kuomintang sympathies, as Yu&#x27;s personal secretary. At the same time, Kang remained an active but secret Party organizer, and was named to the Party&#x27;s new Jiangsu Provincial Committee in June 1927.

In the late 1920s, Kang worked closely with Li Lisan, who had been made head of the Propaganda Department at the CCP&#x27;s Sixth Congress, which for security reasons and proximity to the Comintern&#x27;s congress was held outside Moscow in mid-1928. Several months after the Sixth Congress, Kang was named director of the Organization Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee, which controlled personnel matters.

In 1930, while in Shanghai, Kang was arrested along with several other Communists, including Ding Jishi, and later released. Ding&#x27;s uncle Ding Weifen, was head of the Kuomintang Central Party School in Nanjing, where he worked with Chen Lifu, head of the Kuomintang&#x27;s secret service. Kang later denied he had ever been arrested, as the circumstances of his release suggested that he had, as Lu Futan alleged in 1933, &quot;sold out his comrades&quot; in order to secure his freedom. As Byron and Pack note, however, &quot;Kang&#x27;s arrest in itself is no proof that he was turned by his captors or forced into long-term cooperation with them. KMT [Kuomintang] prisons were notoriously chaotic and corrupt.&quot;

After Li Lisan&#x27;s adventurism and the failed Changsha operation of June 1930 lost Li the support of the Party, Kang moved adroitly to align himself with the Comintern&#x27;s new favorite, Wang Ming, and Pavel Mif&#x27;s young students from Sun Yat-sen University, later known as the 28 Bolsheviks, who took control of the Party Politburo at the Fourth Plenum of the Sixth Central Committee on January 13, 1931. Kang allegedly demonstrated his loyalty to Wang Ming by betraying to the Kuomintang secret police a meeting convened on January 17, 1931, by He Mengxiong, who had been strongly opposed to Li Lisan and was disgruntled by Pavel Mif&#x27;s high-handed role in securing the ascendancy of Wang within the Chinese Communist Party. On the night of February 7, 1931, He Mengxiong and 22 others were executed by the Kuomintang police at Longhua, Shanghai. Among those murdered were five aspiring writers and poets, including Hu Yepin, lover of Ding Ling and father of her child, later canonized as a martyr by the Party.

The April 1931 arrest and defection to the Kuomintang of Gu Shunzhang, former Green Gang gangster and member of the Party&#x27;s Intelligence Cell, led to serious breaches in Party security and the arrest and execution of Xiang Zhongfa, the Party&#x27;s General Secretary. In response, Zhou Enlai created a Special Work Committee to oversee the Party&#x27;s intelligence and security operations. Chaired by Zhou personally, the committee included Chen Yun, Pan Hannian, Guang Huian and Kang Sheng. When Zhou left Shanghai for the Communist base in Jiangxi Province in August 1931, he left Kang in charge of the Special Work Committee, a position he held for two years. In this role, Kang was &quot;in charge of the entire Communist security and espionage apparatus, not only in Shanghai but throughout KMT China.&quot;

==Moscow==
In July 1931, Wang Ming removed himself to Moscow and assumed the position of chief Chinese representative on the Comintern. Kang and his wife Cao Yi&#x27;ou followed two years later. Kang remained in Moscow for four years, acting as Wang&#x27;s deputy on the Comintern, returning to China in 1937. While in Moscow, Kang was elected a member of the Politburo of the CCP, perhaps as early as 1931 but more probably in January 1934.

As Byron and Pack put it, &quot;Kang had no cause to regret working with Wang in Moscow. His own prestige and power grew ever greater, and his cocoon of privilege insulated him from the irritations of daily life. But being in Moscow also excluded Kang and Wang Ming from the drama that was unfolding in China at the time.&quot; That &quot;drama&quot; included the epic retreat of the Communists from Jiangxi Province to Yan&#x27;an, which became known to history as the Long March, and the ever-growing power within the CCP of Mao Zedong. As the French military historian Jacques Guillermaz observed,
The Long March helped the Chinese Communist Party to achieve a greater independence of Moscow. Everything tended in the same direction—Mao Zedong&#x27;s appointment as Chairman of the Party, happening as it did in unusual conditions, practical difficulties in maintaining contact, the Comintern&#x27;s tendency to remain in the background to help the creation of popular fronts, under cover of patriotism or anti-fascism. In fact, after the Zunyi Conference, the Russians seem to have had less and less influence in the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s internal affairs. In light of more recent history, this was perhaps one of the major consequences of the Long March.
Wang Ming&#x27;s influence over the main Communist forces was minimal after Mao Zedong&#x27;s emergence from the Zunyi Conference of January 1935 as the undisputed head of the Party. From Moscow, Wang and Kang did seek to maintain control over Communist forces in Manchuria, which were ordered by them to conserve their strength and avoid direct confrontation with the Japanese army. This directive, which Kang later denied even existed, was resisted by some Manchurian leaders and later criticized by Mao Zedong as evidence of Wang Ming having stifled Manchuria&#x27;s revolutionary potential.

Following the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December 1934, Joseph Stalin commenced his great purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Following this example, and with Wang Ming&#x27;s support, Kang established in 1936 the Office for the Elimination of Counterrevolutionaries and worked closely with the Soviet secret police, the NKVD, in purging perhaps hundreds of Chinese then in Moscow. As Byron and Pack put it:
Kang gained great power from the Elimination Office, which he used to silence opponents and witnesses to any embarrassing episodes in his past, especially his arrest in Shanghai. … This was not the first time the Chinese in Moscow had fallen victim to purges. Soviet authorities had made numerous arrests at Moscow Sun Yat-sen University during the late 1920s; students disappeared into the night, never to be seen again. But Kang worked his own variation: in the past, the Chinese had been purged by the Soviets; now, under Kang, they were liquidated by their fellow Chinese.
Stalin was more tolerant of the Chinese in Moscow than he was of other foreign Communists, who were purged along with their Soviet comrades. This may have been motivated by a concern about the potential threat of a Japanese invasion of the Soviet Far East. In any case, at this time Stalin began to promote the idea of a united front of the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang against the Japanese, a policy that Wang Ming and Kang quickly endorsed. In November 1937, following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the Japanese invasion of China, Stalin dispatched Wang and Kang to Yan&#x27;an on a specially provided Soviet plane.

Kang had played a wily game in the complex and murky world of Stalin&#x27;s Moscow, earning the following comment from Josip Broz Tito, who had met Kang in Moscow in 1935:
It can be said without any shadow of a doubt that at that time Kang Sheng was playing a multiple game. On the one hand he was humoring Stalin, but at the same time he was betraying his confidence. Similarly, he had made contact with the Trotskyists, and had considered joining their movement, but he had also taken steps to infiltrate and sabotage their Fourth International…
Tito made these comments to Hua Guofeng on his only visit to China, in 1977 after Kang was dead, and certainly had his own agenda in doing so, but as Faligot and Kauffer remark, &quot;in any case, Tito certainly got the measure of Kang&#x27;s psychology: a multifaceted game of mirrors was certainly his style, even in the 1930s.&quot;

==Yan&#x27;an==

When Kang Sheng arrived in the Party&#x27;s redoubt at Yan&#x27;an in late November 1937 as part of Wang Ming&#x27;s entourage, he may have already realized that Wang Ming was falling out of favor, but he initially supported Wang and the Comintern&#x27;s efforts to guide the Chinese Communists back into line with Soviet policy, especially the need to align with the Kuomintang against the Japanese. Kang also brought Stalin&#x27;s obsession with Trotskyism to play in helping Wang defeat the efforts of Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu to bring Chen Duxiu—then the informal leader of Trotskyists in China—back into the Party.

After assessing the situation on the ground in Yan&#x27;an, however, in 1938 Kang decided to re-align himself with Mao Zedong. Kang&#x27;s motives are easy to imagine. For Mao&#x27;s part, as MacFarquhar put it,
Kang Sheng was a valuable catch for Mao as he strove to consolidate the power he had won at the Zunyi Conference in January 1935. Kang could betray all the secrets of Wang Ming and his supporters. He was au fait with Moscow politics and police/terror methods, and sufficiently fluent in Russian to act as a major contact with Soviet visitors. He had absorbed sufficient Marxism-Leninism and Stalinist polemicizing to affect the patina of a theorist, and he was a fluent writer.
At Yan&#x27;an, Kang was close to Jiang Qing, who may have been Kang&#x27;s mistress when he visited Shandong in 1931. In Yan&#x27;an, Jiang became the lover of Mao Zedong, who later married her. In 1938, Kang earned Mao and Jiang&#x27;s gratitude by supporting their liaison against the opposition of more socially conservative cadres, who were aware of her past and uncomfortable with it. Byron and Pack assert that
Kang acted decisively to protect Mao and rebut the charges against Jiang Qing. Invoking his background as head of the Organization Department and as an expert on security and espionage matters, Kang vouched for Jiang Qing. She was a Party member in good standing, he declared, and had no affiliations that would bar marriage to Mao. Kang&#x27;s personal knowledge of Jiang Qing&#x27;s past was fragmentary and certainly insufficient to allow him to prove that she was not a KMT agent, but he doctored her record, destroyed adverse material, discouraged hostile witnesses, and coached her on how to answer the probing questions of high-level interrogators who hoped to discredit Mao.
This episode is believed by many to have been key to Kang&#x27;s future success, which depended not only on his considerable talents but also on his relationship with Mao. In addition to politics, Kang and Mao also shared an interest in classical culture, including poetry, painting and calligraphy.

Mao&#x27;s relationship with Kang, in Yan&#x27;an and later, was mainly based on political calculation. Kang&#x27;s familiarity with Wang Ming enabled him to provide Mao with valuable information about Wang&#x27;s subservience to the Soviets. Although cadres such as Chen Yun, who had been in Moscow with Wang and Kang, were aware of Kang&#x27;s previous slavish support for Wang, Kang strenuously sought to change that history and obscure previous affiliations.

In addition, Mao, who in these years had not yet visited the Soviet Union, used Kang during this period as a valuable source of information about Soviet affairs. Mao was also suspicious of the Russians and, soon after aligning himself with Mao, Kang also began to speak out against the Soviet Union and its agents in China. Peter Vladimirov, the Comintern agent sent to Yan&#x27;an, recorded that Kang kept him under constant surveillance and even forced Wang Ming to avoid meeting him. Vladimirov also believed that Kang delivered biased reports of Soviet affairs to Mao.

When Stalin shifted his support from Wang Ming to Mao Zedong, the Personnel Department of the executive committee of the Comintern (the &quot;ECCI&quot;) included Kang&#x27;s name on a list of CCP cadres who should not be included in the leadership. According to Pantsov and Levine,
Once again, the ECCI and, standing behind it, Stalin himself, helped Mao to consolidate his power. This time they even overdid it. Mao did not view Kang Sheng, who had already openly switched to his side, nor several of these other party officials [named in the ECCI Personnel Department memorandum] as his foes. He even tried to defend Kang Sheng in one of his letters to [Georgii] Dimitrov. &quot;Kon Sin [Kang Sheng],&quot; Mao wrote, &quot;is reliable.&quot;
While in Yan&#x27;an, Kang oversaw intelligence operations against the Party&#x27;s two principal enemies, the Japanese and the Kuomintang, as well as potential opponents of Mao within the Party, including the campaign against Trotskyites. Chang and Halliday write that &quot;Shi Zhe observed that Kang was living in a state of deep fear of Mao in this period&quot; because of his murky past, which had been raised with Mao in many letters from cadres and by the Russians, yet &quot;[f]ar from being put off by Kang&#x27;s murky past, Mao positively relished it. Like Stalin, who employed ex-Mensheviks like Vyshinsky, Mao used people&#x27;s vulnerability as a way of giving himself hold over subordinates.&quot; Vladimirov believed that Kang was behind, at Mao&#x27;s behest, the attempt by Li Fuchun and Jin Maoyao to murder Wang Ming by means of mercury poisoning, although this claim remains controversial.

Kang was deeply involved with the Yan&#x27;an Rectification Movement launched by Mao in February 1942, which was &quot;central to Mao&#x27;s mission of a thorough reinvention of Chinese society.&quot; As Rana Mitter writes,
China&#x27;s wartime existential crisis provided a perfect excuse for the rival, yet parallel, states [in Chongqing, Nanjing and Yan&#x27;an] to use similar techniques, from blackmail to bombing, to achieve their ends, and mute the criticisms of their opponents. If each of them paid tribute to Sun Yat-sen in public, they also each paid court to the thinking and techniques of Stalin in private.
In the person of Kang Sheng, Mao had at his disposal a man &quot;trained by one of the world&#x27;s greatest experts in the abuse of human bodies and minds: the head of the Soviet NKVD, Nikolai Yezhov&quot; As Mitter explains,
Kang Sheng was the mastermind behind the &quot;pain and friction&quot; that underlay the Rectification process. He used a classic Soviet technique of accusing loyal party members of being Nationalist spies. Once they had confessed under torture, their confessions could then set off an avalanche of accusations and arrests. As the war worsened in 1943, and the Communist area become more isolated, Kang stepped up the speed and ferocity of the purges.
Kang was sufficiently brutal in his methods to arouse the opposition of senior cadres, including Zhou Enlai, Nie Rongzhen and Ye Jianying. At the same time, Mao was not keen to have a single man in such a position of power. Accordingly, following the CCP&#x27;s Seventh Congress in April 1945, Kang was replaced as head of both the Social Affairs Department and the Military Intelligence Department.

Byron and Pack write that &quot;In spite of Kang&#x27;s decline, his influence on the security and intelligence system was visible for decades to come. The methods he popularized in Yan&#x27;an shaped public security work through the Cultural Revolution and beyond.&quot; Moreover,
[f]or many victims of Rectification, release and rehabilitation in 1945 after the Seventh Party Congress did not protect them permanently against Kang. During the Cultural Revolution, he searched many of them out, arrested them and charged them again with being traitors or renegades. A standard item of evidence used against them was a record of their arrest in Yan&#x27;an during the Rectification Movement—phony charges from the 1940s appeared twenty years later as &quot;proof&quot; of an individual&#x27;s disloyalty.
== From Yan&#x27;an to the Cultural Revolution ==

After his fall from the security posts, in December 1946 Kang was assigned by Mao Zedong, Zhu De and Liu Shaoqi to review the Party&#x27;s land reform project in Longdong, Gansu Province. He returned after five weeks with the view that land reform needed to be more severe and that there could be no compromise with landlords. &quot;Kang whipped up hatred for the landlords and their retainers. In the name of social justice, he encouraged the peasants to settle scores by killing landlords and rich peasants.&quot;

In March 1947, Kang put his methods into practice in Lin County, Shanxi Province. These methods included special scrutiny and persecution of landlords known to have Communist sympathies and investigation of the backgrounds of the Party&#x27;s land reform teams themselves. In April 1948, Mao singled out Kang for praise in his handling of land reform, with the result that
Agrarian reform cut a bloody swath through much of rural China. Squads of Communist enforcers were sent to the most remote villages to organize the local petty thieves and bandits into so-called land reform teams, which inflamed the poor peasants and hired laborers against the rich. When resentment reached fever pitch, peasants at staged &quot;grievance meetings&quot; were encouraged to relate the injustices and insults they had suffered, both real and imagined, at the hands of &quot;the landlord bullies.&quot; Often these meetings would end with the masses, led by the land reform teams, shouting &quot;Shoot him! Shoot him!&quot; or &quot;Kill! Kill! Kill!&quot; The cadre in charge of proceedings would rule that the landlords had committed serious crimes, sentence them to death, and order that they be taken away and eliminated immediately.
In November 1947, the CCP Politburo assigned Kang to inspect land reform in his home province of Shandong. Early in 1948, he was appointed deputy chief of the Party&#x27;s East China Bureau, under Rao Shushi. Some commentators speculate that the private humiliation of being placed under a former subordinate may be one reason why Kang &quot;fell ill&quot; and largely disappeared from view until after Rao&#x27;s fall in 1954. Of course, Kang may really have been ill. Mao&#x27;s personal physician, Li Zhisui, later recorded that doctors responsible for Kang&#x27;s treatment at Beijing Hospital told him that Kang was suffering from schizophrenia. Writing before Li&#x27;s book was published, Byron and Pack offered other possible diagnoses based on symptoms Kang seems to have displayed, including manic-depressive psychosis and temporal lobe epilepsy.

Kang&#x27;s re-emergence on the political stage in the mid-1950s occurred at roughly at the same time as the Gao Gang-Rao Shushi Affair and the affair of Yu Bingbo. Faligot and Kauffer see these affairs as each showing signs of involvement by Kang Sheng, who they believe used them as means to return to power.

In January 1956, Kang made his first public appearance in years at a meeting of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference in Beijing. As Byron and Pack write
The challenges that Kang faced during the early months of 1956 underscored the dangers he would have risked by continuing his retreat. As soon as he reappeared, Kang encountered serious problems that caused his position in the hierarchy to fluctuate dramatically. After the purge of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi in 1954, he had ranked sixth, below Chairman Mao, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De and Chen Yun. But in February 1956, just weeks after his return to public life, he was listed below Peng Zhen. By the end of April he was reported in tenth place, even below Luo Fu, the only member of the 28 Bolsheviks who still held a Politburo seat. Yet on May Day of 1956—the international socialist celebration—Kang was suddenly back in sixth place. His position, at least going by public reports and official bulletins, remained unchanged from then until the Eighth Congress four months later.
Kang suffered a severe reversal of fortune at the Central Committee plenum that followed the first session of the CCP&#x27;s Eighth Congress, when he was demoted to alternate, nonvoting membership of the Politburo. Roderick MacFarquhar writes:
The reasons for Kang Sheng&#x27;s reduction to alternate membership of the Politburo are not clear. … The immediate reason for his demotion may have been the general revulsion against secret police within the communist bloc after Khrushchev&#x27;s Secret Speech. Kang Sheng&#x27;s emergence during the cultural revolution as one of the most important Maoist stalwarts suggests that…it is not unlikely that at the 8th Congress Mao saved Kang from even greater humiliation.
Mao&#x27;s own position was weakening, as evidenced by the decision of the CCP&#x27;s Eighth Congress to delete the phrase &quot;guided by the thought of Mao Zedong&quot; from the new Party constitution and by re-establishing the role of General Secretary, abolished in 1937. The dangers of exalting a single leader and the desirability of collective leadership had been perhaps the most direct point of Khrushchev&#x27;s Secret Speech to the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (the &quot;CPSU&quot;) in February 1956, in which he condemned Stalin, Stalin&#x27;s methods and his cult of personality and which, according to Archie Brown, &quot;was the beginning of the end of international Communism.&quot;

While Kang remained a member of the Politburo, he had no concrete role and no power base, which led him to take on a series of diverse assignments and to align himself as closely as possible with Mao, who was devising his response to de-Stalinization and its effects within the leadership of the CCP. His responses, in the Hundred Flowers and the Anti-Rightist Campaign that followed, marked a profound turning point in the history of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. As Maurice Meisner wrote
The period of the Hundred Flowers was the time when the Chinese abandoned the Soviet model of development and embarked on a distinctively Chinese road to socialism. It was the time that China announced its ideological and social autonomy from the Soviet Union and its Stalinist heritage. It is a cruel and tragic irony that the break with the Stalinist pattern of socioeconomic development was not accompanied by a break with Stalinist methods in political and intellectual life. The latter was precluded by the suppression of the critics who had briefly &quot;bloomed and contended&quot; in May and June 1957.
As noted in connection with the Yan&#x27;an Rectification Movement launched 15 years earlier, Kang Sheng played an important role in bringing Stalinist methods of repression to China.

Kang was clearly a supporter of Mao during the period of the Great Leap Forward and its aftermath and, as MacFarquhar writes, &quot;[h]e was the beneficiary of Mao&#x27;s practice of preserving and protecting those whom he trusted and relied upon, and for whom he saw a future use.&quot; As a result, Kang received a number of important positions during the late 1950s, including in 1959 responsibility for the Central Party School.

Among Kang&#x27;s most important activities in this period were those related to the deepening split with the Soviet Union, about which Mao and others regarded him as something of an expert. Among his assignments from the Politburo was to draft a long article that appeared in &quot;The People&#x27;s Daily&quot; on December 29, 1956, under the title &quot;More on the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat&quot; and which expressed the Party&#x27;s position that Stalin&#x27;s achievements overshadowed his mistakes.

Kang visited the Soviet Union and various socialist countries in Eastern Europe on several occasions between 1956 and 1964, expressing increasing disdain for the &quot;revisionist&quot; policies of Nikita Khrushchev and Josip Broz Tito. In February 1960, as the Chinese observer at the conference of the Political Consultative Conference of the Warsaw Pact, Kang made what Jacques Guillermaz described as &quot;a violent attack on the leaders of the United States, their feigned pacifism, their dream of &#x27;peaceful evolution&#x27; of the socialist countries, and their repeated sabotage of disarmament.&quot; Byron and Pack describe the speech as &quot;a subtle, almost sarcastic critique of Russian foreign policy that became a milestone in deteriorating Sino-Soviet relations.&quot;

The following year, Kang was one of the Chinese delegates to the Twenty-Second Congress of the CPSU to leave their seats to avoid shaking hands with Khrushchev. Kang was also a member of the delegation that attended a meeting in Moscow in July 1963, which failed to bridge the growing gap between the Chinese and Soviet parties. Among the points of contention, raised in a letter issued by the Chinese Communist Party on June 14, 1963, had to do with de-Stalinization and the allegation that
under the pretext of &quot;combating the cult of the individual,&quot; certain persons are crudely interfering in the internal affairs of other fraternal parties and fraternal countries and forcing other fraternal parties to change their leadership in order to impose their own wrong line on those parties.
Jacques Guillermaz asked rhetorically of this criticism, &quot;[c]ould the Chinese really have been thinking of Enver Hoxha?&quot;

The Sino-Soviet rift and the obsession with Khrushchev&#x27;s revisionism looms large in the coming of the Cultural Revolution, as Mao saw revisionism and de-Stalinization as a threat not only to his own position but also to the very survival of the Chinese Communist Party as a revolutionary force. Accordingly, an appreciation of Kang&#x27;s role as a supporter of Mao&#x27;s line in this period helps explain his return to very near the pinnacle of power a few years later.

==Kang Sheng and the Cultural Revolution==

As an ally of Mao Zedong in his effort to regain control of the CCP, Kang was an important enabler of and participant in the Cultural Revolution, later described by the CCP&#x27;s Central Committee as having &quot;lasted from May 1966 to October 1976&quot; and as &quot;responsible for the most severe setback and heaviest losses suffered by the Party, the state and the people since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic.&quot; The Central Committee resolution concluded that the Cultural Revolution &quot;was initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong.&quot; In outlining the &quot;errors&quot; that had been made by Mao and others in the run-up to the Cultural Revolution, the Central Committee noted that &quot;[c]areerists like Lin Biao, Jiang Qing and Kang Sheng, harbouring ulterior motives, made use of these errors and inflated them.&quot;

Well before the start of the Cultural Revolution as such, of course, Kang played his part in attacking rivals of Mao in the Party leadership. In the early 1960s, many of these cadres were unhappy with a range of policies as well as Mao&#x27;s refusal to rehabilitate Peng Dehuai, the former Defense Minister and an early as well as outspoken critic of the Great Leap Forward. In addition, the Great Chinese Famine that had followed the Great Leap Forward had aroused serious doubts among Mao&#x27;s colleagues in the CCP leadership about the wisdom of his choices in leading China to socialism, with many preferring the direction set by Liu Shaoqi. As the chronicler of the famine Yang Jisheng has observed:
The three-year Great Famine undoubtedly intensified the divisions between Mao and Liu. Unreconciled to the failure of the Three Red Banners, Mao ... blamed it on &quot;revisionism&quot; and &quot;class enemies.&quot; Combatting and preventing &quot;revisionism&quot; was therefore the chief task of the Cultural Revolution, as Mao tried to clear the way for establishing his utopia. This meant attacking &quot;capitalist road power-holders&quot; such as Liu Shaoqi, whose attempts to address the problems left over from the Great Famine by giving peasants more autonomy in growing crops and taking a softer line in international affairs were labeled a &quot;counterrevolutionary revisionist line.&quot;
Already in the late 1950s, Mao&#x27;s position had weakened following Khrushchev&#x27;s condemnation of Stalin&#x27;s methods and cult of personality. Mao was further unsettled by subsequent developments in the Soviet Union, of which he became increasingly critical and accused of &quot;revisionism&quot; and abandoning the class standpoint, especially following the adoption by the 22nd congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in October 1961 of theories of &quot;peaceful coexistence&quot; that he regarded as anathema. As Yang Jisheng observes, &quot;Under Mao&#x27;s renewed emphasis on class struggle, &#x27;revisionism,&#x27; &#x27;right-deviating opportunism,&#x27; and &#x27;capitalist restoration&#x27; became interlinked concepts. ... From the 1960s onward, Mao treated fighting revisionism as a crucial political task.&quot;

Kang may or may not have shared these views, but he adroitly exploited Mao&#x27;s concerns about the threat to the chairman&#x27;s vision for China&#x27;s path to socialism presented by &quot;rightists&quot; and &quot;revisionists&quot; who did not entirely share that vision, especially those holding positions in the CCP hierarchy. At the 10th Plenum of the Eighth CCP Central Committee in September 1962, Kang persuaded Mao to use the publication of a novel about Liu Zhidan, a Party member killed in battle against the Kuomintang in 1936, successfully insinuating that the novel&#x27;s publication was an effort by Xi Zhongxun, Jia Tuofu and Liu Jingfan to reverse the Party&#x27;s verdict on their former associate Gao Gang and thus &quot;anti-Party.&quot; As a result of this, the Central Committee appointed Kang to head a special investigation committee to examine the cases of Xi, Jia and Liu. As MacFarquhar writes,
Two months later, [Kang] moved to the Diaoyutai guest complex in the capital to mastermind a team of ideologues for the campaign against Soviet revisionism. The most cynical hit-man of Mao&#x27;s Cultural Revolution swat team was now an agent in place, helping to initiate the domestic and foreign policies that were the prelude to that cataclysm.
In July 1964, Kang, then chairman of the Central Committee&#x27;s Theoretical Committee, was appointed to a five-member Cultural Revolution Small Group under the Central Committee to lead criticism of revisionism in the cultural and academic domains. The group was chaired by Peng Zhen, a Party member since 1923 who was by 1964 the fifth-ranking member of the CCP Central Committee as well as First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and mayor of the capital city.

In January 1965, Mao suggested to the Party Politburo that the principal enemies of socialism in China were &quot;those people in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road&quot; and urged that the Party undertake a &quot;cultural revolution.&quot; In February 1965, Mao sent his wife Jiang Qing to Shanghai to light the first spark of what would become the Cultural Revolution, the campaign against Wu Han, the Vice Mayor of Beijing and the author of the 1961 play &quot;Hai Rui Dismissed from Office&quot;. As Yang Jisheng observes:
As a leading Ming historian within the party, Wu Han used Marxism to interpret history and used history as a politically charged allusion to the present. Prior to the establishment of the PRC, Wu Han&#x27;s works had castigated the founding Ming emperor, Zhu Yuanzhang, as a stand-in for Chiang Kai-shek, but after the PRC was established, Wu&#x27;s book &quot;Zhu Yuanzhang&quot; served as a paean of praise to Mao. This double standard is typical of intellectuals who rise to fame under a totalitarian government.
Mao had actually encouraged Wu Han to write the essay &quot;Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor,&quot; published under a pen name in the People&#x27;s Daily in June 1959. However, Yang Jisheng noted that when Wu Han later wrote the script for the play &quot;...the hypervigilant Jiang Qing and Kang decided [it] was ... &#x27;related to the Lushan Conference and ... implicitly endorsed &#x27;assigning output quotas to households&#x27; and the ongoing verdict-reversal wind. Mao took their views seriously and instructed Jiang Qing to find a hit man to denounce the play.&quot;

The attack on Wu Han was an indirect attack on Peng Zhen, a pillar of the establishment that Mao wanted overthrown. Kang&#x27;s role in the subsequent purge of Peng was to co-lead with Chen Boda the prosecution of Mao&#x27;s charge that &quot;Peng Zhen, the Propaganda Department, and the Beijing Party Committee had shielded bad people while suppressing leftists.&quot; The process took some time, but in May 1966 Peng Zhen, along with Luo Ruiqing, Lu Dingyi and Yang Shangkun were stripped of all official positions. In its verdict on the event long afterwards, the CCP Central Committee concluded, &quot;Lin Biao, Jiang Qing, Kang Sheng, Zhang Chunqiao and others ...exploited the situation to incite people to &#x27;overthrow everything and wage full-scale civil war.&#x27;&quot;. Yang Jisheng observes that:
Rather than say that the downfall of Peng, Luo, Lu and Yang was part of the Cultural Revolution, it would be more accurate to say that it was crucial preparation for Mao&#x27;s comprehensive launch of the Cultural Revolution. Eliminating those four people made Mao feel safer.
The Cultural Revolution was effectively launched when the CCP Central Committee passed a circular on May 16, 1966, the text of which Mao, with assistance from Kang, Chen Boda, Jiang Qing and others, had been instrumental in drafting. Kang became an adviser to the Central Cultural Revolution Small Group, chaired by Chen Boda, upon the group&#x27;s formal establishment by the Central Committee in late May 1966.

Earlier in 1966, Kang Sheng sent his wife, Cao Yi&#x27;ou, to Beijing University as part of a team designed to rally leftists against the university president, Lu Ping, and other officials aligned with Peng Zhen. Cao sought out Nie Yuanzi, a Party branch secretary in the Philosophy Department with whom Kang and Cao had become acquainted years earlier in Yan&#x27;an. With information from Cao Yi&#x27;ou that Lu Ping had lost high-level Party protection, Nie Yuanzi and her leftist allies wrote an infamous big-character poster attacking the university leadership and launching a movement that over the next three months threw Beijing University into chaos.

More significantly for the rest of China, Mao approved the contents of Nie&#x27;s poster and at the beginning of June wrote the following memorandum: &quot;Comrades Kang Shen and Chen Boda: This text can be broadcast in full by the Xinhua News Agency and published in all the country&#x27;s newspapers. It is essential. The smashing of that reactionary fortress, Beiing University, can now begin. Please handle as you see fit.&quot; Kang and Chen made certain that the full text of Nie&#x27;s poster was nationally broadcast in full, along with Mao&#x27;s praise of it as &quot;China&#x27;s first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster&quot; on the day they received the chairman&#x27;s memorandum. As Yue Daiyun wrote about the effects on society: &quot;With no limits imposed, no guidance offered, no one assuming responsibility for what occurred, and the Red Guards merely following their impulses, the assault upon their elders and the destruction of property grew completely out of control.&quot;

In 1968, Mao and other leaders finally began to rein in the Red Guards, with Kang Sheng playing a leading role. In January Kang denounced the Hunan S&quot;hengwulian&quot; coalition of Red Guards as &quot;anarchists&quot; and &quot;Trotskyists,&quot; launching a campaign of brutal suppression over the following months by the army and secret police. By July, when Mao joked with a group of Red Guard leaders that he himself was the &quot;black hand&quot; suppressing campus revolutionaries, the glory days of the movement were ending.

In the turbulent years of the Cultural Revolution, Kang remained close to the pinnacle of power and, as the &quot;evil genius&quot; within the Central Case Examination Group (the &quot;CCEG&quot;) established by the CCP Politburo on May 24, 1966, was instrumental in Mao&#x27;s efforts to purge many senior Party officials, including his most senior rival within the Party, Liu Shaoqi. In the subsequent trial of the so-called &quot;Gang of Four,&quot; one of the accusations leveled against Jiang Qing was that she conspired &quot;with Kang Sheng, Chen Boda, and others to take it upon themselves to convene the big meeting [on July 18, 1967] to apply struggle-and-criticism to Liu Shaoqi, and to carry out a search of his house, physically persecuting the Head of State of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.&quot; Xiao Meng testified at the trial that &quot;the slander and persecution of [Liu Shaoqi&#x27;s wife] Wang Guangmei was plotted by Jiang Qing and Kang Sheng in person.&quot;

Kang&#x27;s position on the CCEG gave him enormous, if invisible power. The very existence of the CCEG remained a secret, &quot;[y]et,&quot; as MacFarquhar and Schoenhals write,
During its thirteen-year existence, the CCEG had powers far exceeding not only those once exercised by the Party&#x27;s Discipline Inspection Commission and Organization Department, but even those of the central public security and procuratorial organs and the courts. The CCEG made the decision to &quot;ferret out,&quot; persecute, arrest, imprison and torture &quot;revisionist&quot; [Central Committee] members and many lesser political enemies. Its privileged employees were the Cultural Revolution equivalent of Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s Cheka and Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Gestapo. Whereas the [Central Cultural Revolution Group] at least nominally dealt in &quot;culture,&quot; the CCEG dealt exclusively in violence. The CCEG was established as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; body but soon became a permanent institution with a staff of thousands that, at one point, was investigating no fewer than 88 members and alternate members of the Party Central Committee for suspected &quot;treachery,&quot; &quot;spying,&quot; and/or &quot;collusion with the enemy.&quot;
During the Cultural Revolution, Kang also abused his position to personal advantage. A gifted painter and calligrapher, he used his power to indulge his penchant for collecting antiques and works of art, notably inkstones. According to Byron &amp; Pack, many of the Cultural Revolution leaders also used the lawlessness of the period to acquire for themselves objects seized from the homes of persons attacked by Red Guards. But Kang, in a series of visits to the Cultural Relics Bureau, &quot;helped himself to 12,080 volumes of rare books—more than were taken by any other radical leader, and 34 percent of all the rare books removed—and 1,102 antiques, 20 percent of the total. Only Lin Biao, who, as Mao&#x27;s designated heir, ranked second in the land, appropriated more antiques than Kang.&quot;

Kang Sheng was instrumental in supervising the drafting of the new Party Constitution, adopted at the CCP&#x27;s Ninth Congress in April 1969, which reinstated &quot;Mao Zedong Thought&quot; alongside Marxism-Leninism as the theoretical basis for the Party. The Congress elected Kang as one of the five members of the Politburo Standing Committee, along with Mao, Lin Biao, Zhou Enlai and Chen Boda. At the Ninth Congress, Kang Sheng&#x27;s wife, Cao Yi&#x27;ou, was herself elected to the Central Committee.

The Constitution drafted under Kang&#x27;s supervision and adopted at the Ninth Congress stipulated that &quot;Comrade Lin Biao is Comrade Mao Zedong&#x27;s close comrade-in-arms and successor.&quot; Kang Sheng and Lin Biao were not close allies, although Kang had earlier assisted Lin in his successful efforts to remove Marshal He Long, a formidable rival to Lin&#x27;s wish to control the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. In the wake of Lin Biao&#x27;s aborted coup attempt and death in September 1971, Kang was careful to distance himself from Mao&#x27;s disgraced former heir and from Chen Boda, who had been closely aligned with Lin at the Central Committee meeting in Lushan in August 1970 and who was denounced after Lin&#x27;s fall as &quot;China&#x27;s Trotsky.&quot; Efforts to link Kang to Lin Biao&#x27;s plotting were unsuccessful and unsubstantiated.

For the remainder of his life, Kang Sheng was actively involved in controlling the CCP propaganda apparatus and in November 1970 was appointed chairman of the new Central Organization and Propaganda Leading Group (&quot;COPG&quot;), created under Mao&#x27;s impetus. The COPG had oversight of the Central Committee Organisation Department, the Central Party School, the People&#x27;s Daily, the Xinhua News Agency, Red Flag magazine, the Central Broadcasting Enterprise Bureau, the Guangming Daily, and the Central Compilation and Translation Bureau. Because the COPG was effectively under Mao&#x27;s direct control, it supplanted the Central Cultural Revolution Small Group and became a rival organization to the Central Military Commission Administrative Group, established in 1967 to try to rein in those attacking the military. Ill with the cancer that would eventually kill him, Kang increasingly ceded control of the COPG to Jiang Qing and her close associates, who were always attentive to Mao&#x27;s wishes.

In his final years, Kang became involved in the Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius campaign that was created by the beneficiaries of the Cultural Revolution to oppose Zhou Enlai and other veteran officials in the struggle over who would succeed Mao Zedong. Kang was initially active in supporting Jiang Qing, perhaps seeing her as a successor through whom he would exercise power. Kang subsequently shifted tack when it became apparent that Jiang was out of favor with Mao, even going so far as to denounce her as having betrayed the Party to the Kuomintang during the mid-1930s, notwithstanding his support for her when the same charge had been leveled 30 years earlier in Yan&#x27;an.

Kang last appeared in public at the Tenth Congress of the CCP, in August 1973. The Tenth Congress adopted a new Constitution that removed the embarrassing reference to Lin Biao as Mao Zedong&#x27;s successor, but as a sign that his position had not been adversely affected, Kang was named one of five vice chairmen of the Party. His final political act came only two months before his death, when he warned Mao Zedong that Deng Xiaoping opposed the Cultural Revolution and should be purged again, advice that Mao ignored.

==Support for the Khmer Rouge==
Kang also left a lasting imprint on China&#x27;s foreign policy. As MacFarquhar writes, &quot;the dual role of Kang Sheng in Mao&#x27;s campaign against revisionism at home and abroad symbolized the close relationship between Chinese domestic and foreign policy.&quot; Kang&#x27;s contribution to the dispute with the Soviet Union about de-Stalinization has been described above in connection with his efforts to insinuate himself with Mao and developing the ideological origins of the Cultural Revolution.

Perhaps Kang&#x27;s most important influence over Chinese foreign policy came during the Cultural Revolution itself, when he was instrumental in developing Chinese support for the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. While the mainstream of the CCP leadership supported Prince Norodom Sihanouk as Cambodia&#x27;s anti-Western and anti-imperialist leader, Kang argued that Khmer Rouge guerrilla leader Pol Pot was the real revolutionary leader in the Southeast Asian nation.

Kang&#x27;s backing of Pol Pot was an effort to back his own cause within the CCP, as his touting of Pol Pot as the true voice of the Cambodian revolution was in large part an attack on the Chinese Foreign Ministry, whose pragmatic support for Prince Sihanouk&#x27;s regime was thereby presented as reactionary. As a result of his success in this, the Pol Pot regime came to power and the Khmer Rouge became the recipient of Chinese aid for years to come.

==Death and disgrace==
Kang Sheng died of bladder cancer on December 16, 1975. He was given a formal funeral, attended by every member of the Politburo except Mao, who did not attend funerals at this stage, and Zhou Enlai and Zhu De, who were both too weak to attend. Marshal Ye Jianying delivered a eulogy in which he praised Kang as &quot;a proletarian revolutionary, a Marxist theoretician, and a glorious fighter against revisionism.&quot;

In November 1978, Hu Yaobang voiced the first formal criticism of Kang in a speech to the Central Party School. Ruan Ming reports Hu as telling four of Kang&#x27;s &quot;anti-revisionist scribblers&quot; that:
you four people have played an extremely negative role in the liberation of thought, the role of a brake. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is because you have come too much under the influence of people like Kang Sheng. … Kang Sheng passed his time reading between the lines looking for &quot;allusions&quot; without taking account of the real subject of articles and the general idea. He made a sort of talent of looking for a particular point he could attack. He had learned this from Stalin, from Andrei Zhdanov and the KGB, and acted thus from the time of the Yan&#x27;an era.
Following the arrest of the Gang of Four and the return to power of Deng Xiaoping, criticisms of Kang Sheng grew and a special case group was established to investigate Kang&#x27;s career. In late summer 1980, the special case group reported to the CCP Central Committee. In October 1980, just in advance of commencing the trial of the Gang of Four, Kang Sheng was posthumously expelled from the CCP and the Central Committee formally rescinded Marshal Ye Jianying&#x27;s eulogy.

In his 1978 speech, Hu Yaobang labeled him as the Chinese equivalent of Dzerzhinsky or Beria, an opinion “shared by a majority of informed Chinese.” Most official published material characterizes him as part of &quot;Lin Biao and Jiang Qing Counter-Revolutionary Cliques&quot;, although some partially positive biographies have been released in recent years detailing his roles in Communist International, Chinese Civil War and the Yan&#x27;an Rectification Movement. Due to his role in the purging of Xi Zhongxun, the father of future General Secretary Xi Jinping, it is unlikely that the party will formally rehabilitate him. In 2008, The US Based &quot;China News Digest&quot; released a previously unpublished interview with Kang&#x27;s widow Cao Yi&#x27;ou conducted in the 1980s where she defends Kang and refutes the charges against him, calling for the CCP to rehabilitate him. The article was initially blocked in mainland China, although in 2015 it re-appeared on the history section of Sina Weibo. The details of his activities after the founding of the PRC in the Intelligence and Security Apparatus of the Party remain classified and closed off to historians, with no new information about him being disclosed by the CCP since the 1980s.

==Personal Life==

Kang Sheng was considered among the best Chinese calligraphers of his generation with numerous notable works. His art name was Lu Chishui, literally &quot;The Red Water of Lu&quot;, as a counterpart to Qi Baishi, literally &quot;The White Rock of Qi&quot;.

He was an avid collector and collected 34000 books and 5500 artefacts, many of which were obtained during the Cultural Revolution. After his death, the collection was donated to the Jingshan Park.

<text>Heterolobosea are a class of Percolozoa. The only member of this class that is infectious to humans is &quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot;, the causative agent of the often fatal disease amoebic meningitis. Typically, their life cycle alternates between flagellate and amoeboid stages.

==Etymology==

==Life Cycle==

==Characteristics==
==Phylogeny==
The first broadly sampled comprehensive phylogenomic (phylotranscriptomic) analysis of the group (from 2025) confirmed the monophyly of Heterolobosea and provided a robustly supported backbone of the phylogeny resulting in the revision of the classification of Heterolobosea to the family level.

The basal split of the cladogram has been confirmed between the subphyla Pharyngomonada (monotypic, with a sole family Pharyngomonadidae) and Tetramitia. In Tetramitia, two main clades (new classes) were identified: Selenaionea, consisting of two orders Neovahlkampfiida and Selenaionida in previously unsuspected but fully supported sister relationship, and Eutetramitea, consisting of orders Creneida, Lyromonadida, Naegleriida (new, including acrasid slime molds), Percolomonadida and Pseudociliatida (represented by the single genus &quot;Stephanopogon&quot;; not included in the new analysis but analyses based on 18S rRNA gene sequences have repeatedly shown its close relationship to Percolomonadida with high statistical support):
==Taxonomy==
These are collectively referred to as schizopyrenids, amoeboflagellates, or vahlkampfids. They also include the acrasids, a group of social amoebae that aggregate to form sporangia. The entire group is usually called the Heterolobosea, but this may be restricted to members with amoeboid stages.

One Heterolobosea classification system is:
* Order Schizopyrenida
** Family Vahlkampfiidae
** Family Gruberellidae
* Order Acrasida
** Family Acrasidae
&quot;Pleurostomum flabellatum&quot; has recently been added to Heterolobosea.

<text>Chi Psi () is a fraternity consisting of active chapters at 34 American colleges and universities. Chi Psi was founded in 1841 at Union College in Schenectady, New York. It was the first Greek-letter organization to be founded on the grounds of fraternal bonds, rather than the literary characteristics of the seven then-existing fraternities.

Chi Psi was the first fraternity in the nation to establish a fraternity house. This was a building at the University of Michigan, which was said to resemble a hunting lodge; hence, Chi Psi now refers to all its houses as lodges.

==History==
Chi Psi was founded on May 20, 1841, by ten students at Union College. The founding members were Philip Spencer, Robert Heyward McFaddin, Jacob Henry Farrell, John Brush Jr., Samuel Titus Taber, James Lafayette Witherspoon, William Force Terhune, Alexander Peter Berthoud, James Chatham Duane, and Patrick Upshaw Major.

Chi Psi was founded as a brotherhood that embraces related values that were adopted at its founding in 1841. A revision of the values was adopted at 122nd National Convention in 1963. Chi Psi also embraces the idea of being a true gentleman, by following the definition of a gentleman as put forward by John Walter Wayland&#x27;s &quot;The True Gentleman&quot;:
In 1846, Chi Psi was the first fraternity in the nation to establish a fraternity house. This was a building at the University of Michigan, which was said to resemble a hunting lodge; hence, Chi Psi now refers to all its chapter houses as lodges. The Chi Psi newsletter, &quot;The Purple &amp; Gold,&quot; was first published in November 1883, and was named for the fraternity&#x27;s official colors. The fraternity&#x27;s national headquarters is in Nashville, Tennessee.

==Activities==
The Chi Psi Educational Trust has funded the Program for Excellence, consisting of workshops that instill the fraternity&#x27;s members with a respect for themselves, the people they are around, and their community.

==Chapters==

Chi Psi refers to its chapters as Alphas.

== Leadership ==
=== President ===
The national President of Chi Psi is known as the #7. The first #7 was elected in 1879, thirty-eight years after the founding of Chi Psi. The #7&#x27;s are:
=== Executive Director ===
The executive director of Chi Psi is known as the #23. The first #23 was appointed in 1921. The #23&#x27;s are:

==Notable members==
== Chapter or member misconduct ==
A pledge named Gordie Bailey died of an alcohol overdose at University of Colorado Boulder in 2004. He was found face down on the floor of the Chi Psi house, where members had drawn slurs all over his body while he was passed out. The Chi Psi chapter was temporarily suspended. A 2017 &quot;USA Today&quot; article used Bailey&#x27;s death to illustrate that fraternity chapters frequently continue operations with little interruption after a death.

In 1971, Chi Psi at the University of Virginia conducted a staged lynching with a group of black-hooded students with rifles surrounding a black-faced mannequin swinging from a tree. A photograph of the spectacle was published in the university&#x27;s yearbook, where it was rediscovered by journalists at &quot;The Cavalier Daily&quot; in 2019. The Frank Zappa quote, &quot;You know I&#x27;m not black, but there&#x27;s a whole lot of times I wish&#x27;d I wasn&#x27;t white&quot;, was displayed on the opposing page and was part of the Chi Psi yearbook entry. So, the objectionable photo, combined with the quote, appears to have been a poorly executed attempt at condemnation of racism and violence against blacks.

<text>Ahmed Rashid (Urdu:; born 1948 in Rawalpindi) is a Pakistani journalist and best-selling foreign policy author of several books about Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Central Asia.

==Life and career==
Rashid was born in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. He attended Malvern College, England, Government College Lahore, and Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge at Cambridge University in the late 1960s.

After graduating, Rashid spent ten years in the hills of Balochistan, attempting to organise an uprising against the Pakistani military dictatorships of Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan. He ended his guerrilla fighting days frustrated and defeated and turned his attention to writing about his homeland.

He has been the Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia Correspondent for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; for more than 20 years and a correspondent for &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot;. He also writes for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;Daily Times (Pakistan)&quot; and academic journals. He appears regularly on international TV channels and radio networks such as CNN, BBC World and many Pakistani TV channels. Rashid is often sought after for advice by diplomats in Islamabad and Kabul, and by policy makers in NATO capitals and Washington.&quot;

He is a well known and vocal critic of the Bush administration in relation to the Iraq war and its alleged neglect of the Taliban issue. Rashid&#x27;s 2000 book, &quot;&quot;, was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller for five weeks, translated into 22 languages, and has sold 1.5 million copies since the September 11, 2001 attacks, &quot;an astonishing number for an academic press.&quot; The book was used extensively by American analysts in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Rashid charged that former President George W. Bush plagiarized his work in writing his memoirs.

His commentary also appears in &quot;The Washington Post&#x27;s&quot; Post Global segment. &quot;Rashid is a regular columnist for leading national and international publications and a frequent guest on NPR&#x27;s (National Public Radio) Fresh Air.&quot;
&quot;An expert on the Taliban -- until 9/11 he knew them better than almost any outsider -- Mr. Rashid has over the decades turned out to be something of a prophet in the region, though mostly of the Cassandra type, issuing repeated warnings that are ignored by policy makers.&quot;
Ahmed Rashid is married with two children and lives in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.

<text>The giant kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ingens) is an endangered species of heteromyid rodent endemic to California.

==Description==
The giant kangaroo rat, is the largest of over 20 species of kangaroo rats, which are small members of the rodent family. It measures about in length, not including its long, tufted tail, and is tan or brown in color. Like other kangaroo rats it has a large head, large eyes, and long, strong hind legs which helps it hop quickly.

The giant kangaroo rat lives on dry, sandy grasslands and digs burrows in loose soil. It lives in colonies, and the individuals communicate with each other by drumming their feet on the ground. These foot thumping signals range from single, short thumps to long, drawn out &quot;footrolls&quot; that can average over 100 drums at 18 drums per second. These audible signals serve both as a warning of approaching danger, as a territorial communication, and to communicate mating status.

Kangaroo rats are primarily seed eaters, but also eat green plants and insects. Most giant kangaroo rats gather seeds when they are available and store them for consumption later. The seeds are put into small pits on the surface of the soil and scattered over the home range of the individual. The small pits only hold the content of the two cheek pouches.

In the spring and summer, individuals generally spend less than two hours of the night foraging above ground. They are very territorial and never leave their den for more than 15 minutes per day. The giant kangaroo rat then stores the seeds in a larder for later eating and gives birth to a litter of 1 to 8 babies, with an average of 3 per litter. It communicates with potential mates by sand-bathing, where the giant kangaroo rat rubs its sides in sand, leaving behind a scent to attract mates. They live for only 2–4 years.

The mating of the giant kangaroo rat is seasonal. During the summer, male rats go out of their normal territories and mate with neighboring female rats. During the winter, the males stay in their original burrow.

== Conservation ==

In 1987, United States Fish and Wildlife classified the kangaroo rat as an endangered species, chiefly due to habitat loss. This species was declared endangered on both the federal and California state levels in the 1980s. It inhabits less than a mere 2% of its original range and can now be found only in isolated areas west of the San Joaquin Valley, including the Carrizo Plain, the Elkhorn Plain, and the Kettleman Hills. The giant kangaroo rat, like many other rodent species, lost much of its habitat as the Central Valley fell under agricultural use. Much information still needs to be obtained regarding their basic biology and compatibility with various land uses before clear directives can be made. Besides some projects currently underway in the Carrizo Plain National Monument, studies need to be conducted on populations whose range overlaps with private lands. Recovery of the giant kangaroo rat can be achieved when the three largest populations in eastern Kern County, Carrizo Plain Natural Area, and the Panoche Region along with the populations in the Kettleman Hills, San Juan Creek Valley and Cuyama Valley are protected and managed appropriately. In a unique case, a giant kangaroo rat population was found during the construction of the second track at Buttonwillow Raceway Park. The track design was modified and a protected habitat was created in the middle of the new track.

Endangered &quot;Dipodomys ingens&quot; populations have become more dispersed and less numerous over time. This can have major side effects to the genetic diversity of the species. &quot;D. ingens&quot; populations only cover about 3% of the territory they historically occupied. Agricultural development has severely impacted the habitats of this rodent, and restricted it to several small isolated areas. Because of this, &quot;D. ingens&quot; is at risk for genetic drift and inbreeding within smaller populations. &quot;D. ingens&quot; lives in metapopulation structures due to their habitats being taken over by humans. They are divided into several small remnant populations that are unable to disperse over larger areas because of topographical limitations. This is a larger problem for northern subpopulations of than those in the south. &quot;D. ingens&quot; is believed to be polygynous (one male, multiple females) but a common ratio between male and female partners has not yet been found. The study showed that translocation was a successful method for increasing diversity and population size of &quot;D. ingens&quot;.

In early 2013, a collaboration was set up between the Bitter Creek National Wildlife Refuge, CSU Stanislaus&#x27;s Endangered Species Recovery Program, and the Endangered Species Recovery Program. This recovery plan established the Small Mammal Monitoring Project, focusing on adaptive management and promoting the growth of grasslands with low vegetation.

In 2017, a combination of trapping and satellite imaging was used to determine habitat suitability and conduct and index of presence in the San Joaquin Desert. Since burrow mounds are fairly large, typically inhabited by one rat, and uniformly spaced apart, this made it possible to use aerial surveys and Google Earth satellite imagery. This study highlighted high-quality habitat areas to focus on for future management decisions.

<doc id="514873" wikidata="Q316630" url="?curid=514873" title="List of subcamps of Neuengamme">
<text>Below is an incomplete list of SS subcamps of Neuengamme camp system operating from 1938 until 1945. The Neuengamme concentration camp established by the SS in Hamburg, Germany, became a massive Nazi concentration camp complex using prisoner forced labour for production purposes in World War II. Some 99 SS subcamps were part of the Neuengamme camp system, with up to 106,000 inmates. The number of prisoners per location ranged from more than 5,000 to only a dozen at a work site. Beginning in 1942, inmates of Neuengamme were also transported to the camp &quot;Arbeitsdorf&quot;. &quot;Toward the ends of the war three times more prisoners were in satellite camps than in the main camp&quot; wrote Dr. Garbe of the &quot;Neuengamme Memorial Museum&quot;. Several of the subcamps have memorials or plaques installed, but as of 2000, there was nothing at 28 locations.

The inmates were forced to work under grueling conditions in various locations across northern Germany; often transported between subcamps and specific job sites. Due to subsequent demolition of the Neuengamme camp system by the SS in 1945 including its records, the historical work is difficult and still incomplete. For example, in 1967, the German Federal Ministry of Justice suggested that the camp operated from 1 September 1938 until 5 May 1945 and became part of the Sachsenhausen in June 1940. The &quot;Neuengamme Memorial&quot; organization (German: &quot;KZ-Gedenkstätte Neuengamme&quot;), an establishment of the Hamburg Ministry of Culture, Sports and Media, stated in 2008 that the empty camp was explored by British forces on 2 May 1945 and the last inmates were liberated in Flensburg on 10 May 1945. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the camp was established on 13 December 1938 and liberated on 4 May 1945. Throughout World War II, millions of prisoners died in Nazi labour camps through mistreatment, disease, starvation and overwork, or were executed as unfit for labour. At Neuengamme, 1,700 people died each month in winter of 1944-1945, more than 50,000 in total.

==At the main camp==

#Canalize of the &quot;Dove Elbe&quot;, a branch of the Elbe river: &quot;Elbekommando&quot;
#&quot;Klinkerwerk&quot; (brick factory) of the DEST
#&quot;Lagergärtnerei&quot; (camp plant nursery)
#&quot;Tongruben&quot; (clay cavities)
#Manufacturing plant of the Walther-Werke
#Armament factories of &quot;Messap&quot; and &quot;Jastram&quot;

==In Hamburg==

Subcamps and working locations in Hamburg proper sorted by name.
==Outside of Hamburg==

Subcamps of Neuengamme in alphabetical order. Using the political division of Germany of the year 2000, there were at least 34 subcamps in Lower Saxony, 9 in Bremen, 9 in Schleswig-Holstein, 6 in North Rhine-Westphalia, 5 in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, 3 in Saxony-Anhalt, and 1 in Brandenburg. Also, four subcamps were located in Alderney, occupied Channel Islands, British Commonwealth.
==Construction labor brigades==
Inmates of concentration camps were centralized in construction labor brigades (German:Baubrigaden), organized by the SS, to clean up after air raids, remove unexploded ordnance devices and bombs, or recover corpses. Some of the brigades worked also at the &quot;Friesenwall&quot;—part of the &quot;Atlantic Wall&quot; at the German North Sea coast—and fortifications in German cities e.g. antitank obstacles. Other brigades were placing or repairing rails or railway stations.

On January 31, 1862, while testing a new aperture great refractor telescope in Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, Clark made the first ever observation of a white dwarf star. This discovery of Sirius B, or affectionately &quot;the Pup&quot;, proved an earlier hypotheses (Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel in 1844) that Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky with an apparent magnitude of −1.46, had an unseen companion disturbing its motion. Clark used the largest refracting telescope lens in existence at the time, and the largest telescope in the United States, to observe the magnitude 8 companion.

Clark&#x27;s 18.5 inch refracting telescope was then delivered to his customer, the landmark Dearborn Observatory of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where it is still being used today.

Alvan Graham Clark died in Cambridge, Massachusetts on June 9, 1897.

<text>Alvan Clark (March 8, 1804 – August 19, 1887), born in Ashfield, Massachusetts, was an American astronomer and telescope maker.

==Biography==
He started as a portrait painter and engraver (c.1830s–1850s), and at the age of 40 became involved in telescope making. Using glass blanks made by Chance Brothers of Birmingham, England, and Feil-Mantois of Paris, France, his firm Alvan Clark &amp; Sons ground lenses for refracting telescopes. Their lenses included the largest in the world at the time: the at Dearborn Observatory at the Old University of Chicago (the lens originally intended for Ole Miss); also the two telescopes at the United States Naval Observatory and McCormick Observatory, the at Pulkovo Observatory, which was destroyed in the Siege of Leningrad (only the lens survives), the telescope at Lick Observatory (still the third-largest), and later the at Yerkes Observatory, which remains the largest successful refracting telescope in the world.

Although not specifically searching for double stars, he did make a number of discoveries while testing his completed telescope objectives, including Mu Herculis, 8 Sextantis, and 95 Ceti. One of Clark&#x27;s sons, Alvan Graham Clark, discovered the dim companion of Sirius. Two craters bear Clark Sr.&#x27;s name. The crater Clark on the Moon is jointly named for him and his son, Alvan Graham Clark, and one on Mars is named in his honour. His other son was George Bassett Clark; both sons were partners in the firm.

Clark was also competitive in target shooting and received a patent for his device to allow bullets to be seated into a muzzle-loading rifle without damage to either the bullet or the rifle&#x27;s muzzle. Exclusive license to this patent (1,565 of April 24, 1840) was made to Edwin Wesson, brother of Daniel B. Wesson.

In 1880, Clark was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

<text>USS &quot;Long&quot; (DD-209/DMS-12), named for John Davis Long (1838–1915), Secretary of the Navy from 1897 to 1902, was a of the United States Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Long&quot; was laid down by the William Cramp &amp; Sons at Philadelphia on 23 September 1918, launched on 26 April 1919 by Mrs. Arnold Knapp (née Julia James Long) and commissioned on 20 October 1919.

==Service history==
After shakedown along the United States East Coast, &quot;Long&quot; sailed late in the year for the Mediterranean. Assigned to Destroyer Division 26, she patrolled the Adriatic and Mediterranean and served as station ship before steaming to the Philippines early in 1921 for duty with Asiatic station. Based at Cavite, Luzon, she patrolled the South China Sea until July 1922 when she was ordered to the United States. &quot;Long&quot; decommissioned at San Diego, California, 30 December 1922.

&quot;Long&quot; recommissioned at San Diego 29 March 1930. Operating out of San Diego during the next decade, &quot;Long&quot; cruised primarily in the Pacific off North and Central America for division exercises and screen and plane guard duty. Between 1933 and 1935 she twice entered the rotating Reserve as part of Destroyer Squadron 20.

In 1940, she was converted to destroyer minesweeper, and reclassified DMS-12 on 19 November 1940.

===World War II===
&quot;Long&quot; operated along the United States West Coast and in Hawaiian waters with Mine Squadron 2. On 5 December 1941, she departed Pearl Harbor in the screen for . Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor two days later, she returned there 9 December and began antisubmarine patrols. She also escorted ships among the Hawaiian Islands and between March and June 1942, made escort runs to Midway, Palmyra, and Canton.

&quot;Long&quot; left Pearl Harbor 30 June for patrol and escort duty in Alaskan waters. After colliding with in heavy fog 27 July, she repaired at San Francisco, California, returning to Kodiak on 27 September for screen and antisubmarine patrols. During the Arctic winter, she patrolled the approaches to Adak and guarded convoys as American forces sought to defeat Japanese garrisons in the western Aleutians.

====Alaska====
&quot;Long&quot; took part in the unopposed occupation of Amchitka 12 January 1943, and while patrolling along the Island, helped repel Japanese air attacks 31 January and 1 February. Thence, she joined Rear Admiral Francis W. Rockwell&#x27;s TF 51 on 3 May for the Invasion of Attu. Steaming through the heavy spring seas and blanketing fog of the Bering Sea, she closed on Attu on 11 May and swept for mines prior to the successful landings later that day.

&quot;Long&quot; continued escort and patrol operations for the occupations of Attu and Kiska through the summer, returning to Pearl Harbor on 16 September to escort merchantmen to San Francisco where she overhauled. After patrol in Hawaiian waters from 15 November to 22 January 1944, she escorted reinforcements to Roi and Namur in the Marshalls on 2 February, then joined TF 76 on 28 February in New Guinea waters. She served as an escort and swept mines in the conquest of the Admiralties early in March, then escorted convoys to and from Milne Bay, Guadalcanal, and Espiritu Santo from Cape Sudest.

====Hollandia and Marianas====
On 18 April, &quot;Long&quot; sailed for the invasion of the Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) area; she entered Humboldt Bay 22 April, made an exploratory sweep, and then fired a close-in preinvasion bombardment. &quot;Long&quot; arrived at Guadalcanal early in May to prepare for the Marianas assault, for which she sailed 4 June. Arriving Saipan 13 June for preinvasion sweeps west of the island, &quot;Long&quot; served as radar picket and guard ship until 24 June, then after a voyage to the Marshalls, screened the battleship during preinvasion bombardment of Guam beginning 12 July. After antisubmarine and convoy escort duty, &quot;Long&quot; joined TG 32.5 at Guadalcanal 16 August.

====Palaus====
&quot;Long&quot; sortied for the assault on the Palaus on 6 September, cleared mines off Peleliu and Angaur, and in Kossol Passage from 12 to 16 September, then had escort and patrol duty between the Palaus and Admiralties until joining the 7th Fleet on 4 October for the invasion of the Philippines.

====Philippines====

Leaving Seeadler Harbor 10 October with Minesweeping Unit 1, &quot;Long&quot; entered Leyte Gulf on 17 October. Spearheading the invasion, she cleared mines off Dinagat and Hibuson Islands, and in the Dulag-Tacloban approach channel. After sweeping Surigao Strait, she patrolled and served as smokescreen ship in Leyte Gulf until 23 October, when the destroyer joined the transport screen and steamed in convoy for Manus, arriving on 29 October.

=====Sunk by kamikazes at Lingayen Gulf=====
After repairs and training at Manus, &quot;Long&quot; departed 23 December to sweep for the landings at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon; her group was attacked 2 January 1945 in the Mindanao Sea in the first of the frequent air raids with which the Japanese attempted to repel the invasion of Luzon. &quot;Long&quot; began mine sweeps in Lingayen Gulf 6 January, evading and firing upon Japanese aircraft as she carried out her intricate mission. Shortly after noon, beginning her second run, &quot;Long&quot; spotted two Mitsubishi A6M Zeros heading for her.

&quot;Long&quot; went to 25 knots and opened fire, but a &quot;kamikaze&quot; crashed into her portside below the bridge about 1 foot above the waterline. With fires and explosions amidships, &quot;Long&quot; lost power and internal communications, and was unable to fight fires forward. Her commanding officer, Lieutenant Stanley Caplan, fearing an explosion in the forward magazine, gave permission for men trapped on the forecastle to leave the ship, but through a misunderstanding, the crew aft abandoned ship. All were quickly rescued by standing by to aid the burning but still seaworthy ship, in fact a total of 149 of Long&#x27;s crew were picked up by the &quot;Hovey&quot;.

Lieutenant Caplan prepared to lead a salvage party and board &quot;Long&quot; from , but continuing heavy air attacks prevented firefighting and salvage attempts. Later that afternoon a second plane attacked &quot;Long&quot; and exploded at the same spot, destroying the bridge and breaking the ship&#x27;s back. &quot;Long&quot; capsized and sank the following morning, January 7. Around eighteen of the survivors rescued from the &quot;Long&quot; by &quot;Hovey&quot; perished when &quot;Hovey&quot; herself received an aerial torpedo to her aft engine room on January 7 around 450. Most of Hovey&#x27;s survivors were rescued by the &quot;USS Chandler&quot;.

==Awards==
&quot;Long&quot; received nine battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Seinäjoki (; &quot;Wall River&quot;; , formerly ) is a city in Finland and the regional capital of South Ostrobothnia. Seinäjoki is located in the western interior of the country and along the River Seinäjoki. The population of Seinäjoki is approximately , while the sub-region has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland, and the 13th most populous urban area in the country.

Seinäjoki is located east of Vaasa, north of Tampere, west of Jyväskylä and southwest of Oulu. 

Seinäjoki originated around the Östermyra bruk iron and gunpowder factories founded in 1798. Seinäjoki became a municipality in 1868, a market town in 1931, and a town in 1960. In 2005, the municipality of Peräseinäjoki was merged into Seinäjoki, and at the start of 2009, the neighbouring municipalities of Nurmo and Ylistaro were amalgamated with Seinäjoki. The city itself is growing steadily from year to year, but the population of the surrounding municipalities is correspondingly decreasing.

The city hall, city library, Lakeuden Risti Church and other public buildings were designed by Alvar Aalto. Seinäjoki was historically called &quot;&quot; in Swedish. Today, this name, which was never official, is very seldom used even among Swedish speakers. Seinäjoki Airport is located in the neighbouring municipality of Ilmajoki, south from the Seinäjoki city centre. Seinäjoki railway station in city centre was opened in 1883 and until 1897, it carried the name Ostermyra station.

==History==

The settlement spread in the area of the present Seinäjoki during the first half of the 16th century. During the 1550s, there is said to have been three houses in Seinäjoki: the houses of Marttila, Jouppi and Uppa. The house of Jouppila, which separated from the house of Jouppi, was established during the same century. All of the houses were located on the shore of the river.

Seinäjoki belonged to the church parish of Ilmajoki like Kurikka, Kauhajoki, Jalasjärvi and Alavus. However, in the 18th century the roads from Seinäjoki to the Church of Ilmajoki were generally in poor condition. Therefore, the inhabitants of Seinäjoki and the neighbouring Nurmo built a new chapel together in 1725, which in 1765 led to the formation of the chapel town of Nurmo. Seinäjoki, which was called Alaseinäjoki since the Greater Wrath, became a part of the chapel town. The chapel parish of Peräseinäjoki was founded in 1798, and the village of Alaseinäjoki began to be called Seinäjoki again. The very same year, the Östermyra steel mill was founded on the shore of the Seinäjoki river.
In the 1850s, actions were taken to separate Seinäjoki from the church parish of Nurmo. Ilmajoki wanted to connect Seinäjoki back to its own parish. In spite of strong objections from the inhabitants of Nurmo, the Senate of Finland accepted the petition from the inhabitants of Seinäjoki in 1863, to form a chapel congregation of their own. Seinäjoki got an independent local government in 1868. In 1900, Seinäjoki became an independent municipality.

Seinäjoki has grown around a few important railroad crossings. The Tampere–Vaasa railway, which passes through Seinäjoki, was inaugurated in 1883. The track, along with the Kokkola track that was opened for rail service in 1885, and the Kristinestad track which had been completed in 1913, raised Seinäjoki as an important railway crossing section in Finland. In the early 1970s, a direct railway between Tampere and Seinäjoki was opened, and the services of Seinäjoki improved further.

After the Winter War and Continuation War, some refugees from Jaakkima and Lumivaara were resettled to Seinäjoki.

<text>Woolworths Group Limited is an Australian multinational retail and finance company, primarily known for the operation of its retail chain Woolworths Supermarkets across Australia, Woolworths (previously known as Countdown) in New Zealand and its discount department store Big W. Headquartered in Bella Vista, Sydney, it is the largest company in Australia by revenue and number of employees, and the second-largest in New Zealand.

Founded in Sydney in 1924 as variety retailer Woolworths Limited, the company entered the New Zealand market in 1929 and has traded in every Australian state and territory since 1960. Woolworths experienced steady growth throughout the 20th century and began to diversify its business, closing the last of its variety stores in the 1980s to focus on its portfolio of other retail brands. Since 2012, Woolworths has undergone significant consolidation, divesting its shopping centre, electronics retailing, home improvement, fuel retailing, liquor retailing and hospitality businesses to concentrate on supermarket retail.

Woolworths currently owns Woolworths Supermarkets, customer loyalty program Everyday Rewards and discount department store Big W in Australia and the Woolworths NZ, SuperValue and FreshChoice supermarkets in New Zealand.

==History==
=== Founding and early growth (1924–1957) ===
Woolworths opened its first store, the Woolworths Stupendous Bargain Basement, in the old Imperial Arcade Pitt Street, Sydney, where Westfield Sydney now stands, on 5 December 1924. Woolworths Ltd&#x27;s nominal capital was £185,000, and although 85,000 shares were offered to the public, only 81,707 shares were subscribed for by 619 people, including the five founders – Percy Christmas, Stanley Chatterton, Cecil Scott Waine, George Creed and Ernest Williams. One of the founding investors was Preston Lanchester Gowing, the then chairman of the department store chain Gowings.

The name on the draft prospectus drawn up by Cecil Scott Waine was &quot;Walworth&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; – a play on the name of F.W. Woolworth, the owner of the Woolworth&#x27;s chain in the United States and United Kingdom. According to Ernest Robert Williams, Percy Christmas dared him to register the name Woolworths instead, which he succeeded in doing after finding out the name was available for use in New South Wales.

The new Woolworths store was the first variety store in the world to use cash registers that print receipts for customers.

During the late 1920s the company grew, with a second store in Sydney and stores in Brisbane, Perth and Wellington in New Zealand. The company grew further in the 1930s, despite the depression, until by the end of 1933 it had 23 stores. In 1933 the first store in Melbourne was opened and on 1 April 1936 the company bought eight stores from Edments Ltd and opened its first store in Adelaide. Following the opening of the Hobart store in 1940, Woolworths had a store in every state in Australia.

World War II slowed the growth of the company, with the Australian and United States militaries commandeering Woolworths&#x27; warehouses in Sydney for storage. After the war expansion was once again rapid and in 1955 Woolworths opened its 200th store, in the Civic Centre in Canberra.

=== Diversification, expansion and takeover (1957–1993) ===
In 1957, Woolworths began to diversify from variety retailing when it opened its first food store at Dee Why, Sydney. The company further diversified in 1960, opening it first purpose-built supermarket at Warrawong, purchasing the Rockmans chain of women&#x27;s clothing stores and commencing selling liquor at some outlets.

In the 1960s, the company opened a department store to compete against the likes of Myer and David Jones, under the brand Big W which was short lived, but the name was resurrected in the 70s as a Discount department store as we know it today. Woolworths also began converting its variety stores to supermarkets and removing many of its variety products from sale. In 1979, Woolworths sold its New Zealand operations to LD Nathan &amp; Co.

In 1981, Woolworths purchased 60 percent of consumer electronics retailer Dick Smith, acquiring the rest of the company in 1983 for a total price of A$25 million.

In 1985, the acquisition of 126 Safeway supermarkets in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland (including Food Barn branded stores) made Woolworths the largest food retailer in Australia. As part of the purchase of Safeway&#x27;s Australian stores, Safeway Inc acquired a 20 percent interest in Woolworths Limited. In 1989, the last of the Woolworths Variety stores was closed and Woolworths &quot;Family Centres&quot; were split into separate Big W discount stores and Woolworths branded supermarket stores.

Woolworths Limited was acquired by Industrial Equity Limited in 1989, a consortium of Adelaide Steamship Company, David Jones Limited and Tooth &amp; Co.

=== IPO and further diversification and expansion (1993–2012) ===
In 1993, Industrial Equity floated Woolworths on Australian Securities Exchange in what was then the biggest initial public share offering in Australia&#x27;s history.

In 1996, Woolworths entered the petrol retailing market, initially with wholly-owned &quot;Plus Petrol&quot; outlets located in shopping centre parking lots. Woolworths expanded its liquor retailing portfolio with the acquisition of the Dan Murphy&#x27;s liquor barn stores in 1998. In 1999, Woolworths began a joint venture with the Commonwealth Bank called Woolworths Ezy Banking, which was scaled back by 2006.

In 2001, Woolworths expanded its consumer electronics retailing interests with the purchase of the Tandy chain in Australia from InterTan. Also in 2001, Woolworths established the smaller format liquor retailing chain BWS to complement its big-box liquor retailer Dan Murphys.

In 2003, Woolworths entered into an agreement with Caltex to jointly supply food and groceries to Woolworths owned petrol stations and selected Caltex sites near Woolworths supermarkets, with petrol stations covered by the joint venture co-branded as Caltex Woolworths.

With Queensland licensing laws dictating that liquor retail outlets must be operated by a hotelier, Woolworths moved into the hotel industry in 2004 by acquiring 75 percent of the Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group (ALH) in a joint venture with business partner Bruce Mathieson. In 2005, Woolworths expanded its portfolio to 250 hotels by acquiring the Taverner Hotel Group. Statistics provided during the acquisition of the Taverner group showed that over one-third of sales were made up of gaming/pokie machine takings (slot machines) with the total number of pokie machines owned by ALH after its acquisitions being 10,722.

In 2005, Woolworths re-entered the New Zealand market by purchasing the retailer Progressive Enterprises, owner of supermarket brands including Countdown, in a deal that gave the company a 45 percent share of the New Zealand grocery sector. In the same deal, the company also acquired 22 Action supermarket stores in Western Australia, bringing the total number of Woolworths supermarkets in Australia to near 750. In 2006, Woolworths announced that it had taken a 10 percent strategic stake in The Warehouse Group in New Zealand and announced a joint venture with the Tata Group to introduce the Dick Smiths Electronics store format in India.

In August 2007, Woolworths announced that it was planning to launch a general purpose credit card in 2008. It is expected to offer credit cardholders reward vouchers redeemable through its store network. HSBC was subsequently named as its credit card partner. Woolworths subsequently announced that the &quot;Woolworths Everyday Money MasterCard&quot; would be launched on 26 August 2008 and allows customers to earn shopping cards redeemable at Woolworths group retailers. It was suggested Woolworths could earn approximately $20m from credit cards in three years and that it was targeting 100,000 to 150,000 cardholders in the first year.

In April 2008, Woolworths launched Thomas Dux, a gourmet grocer and deli. After the company purchased the Macro Wholefoods organic grocery chain in May 2009, it converted eight stores to Thomas Dux stores. In February 2011, Woolworths announced it would acquire the Cellarmasters liquor business for $340 million.

During 2009, Woolworths and American retailer Lowe&#x27;s purchased Danks Ltd owners of the Home Timber and Hardware brand and then entered into a joint venture to launch a new hardware brand named Masters Home Improvement. The first of these stores were opened to the public in Braybrook, Melbourne, Victoria, on 1 September 2011.

=== Consolidation (2012–2019) ===
In 2012, Woolworths placed 69 shopping centres it owned into a real estate investment trust known as Shopping Centres Australasia Property Group (SCA Property Group), which listed as a separate entity on the ASX on 26 November 2012. Most of the locations contain a Woolworths owned store as an anchor tenant, with the trust deriving most of its rental income from Woolworths Limited stores. Woolworths announced it was exiting the consumer electronics retailing sector in September 2012, completing the sale of its Indian electronics wholesale business to Infiniti Retail for $A35 million and the sale of the Dick Smith Electronics chain to Anchorage Capital Partners for A$20 million. In May 2013, Woolworths acquired a 50 percent stake in analytics firm Quantium for $20 million. In December 2014, Woolworths acquired Summergate, an alcoholic drinks distributor in China for A$27 million.

In 2015, Woolworths&#x27; home improvement chain Masters posted a loss of and on 18 January 2016 Woolworths announced that it intended to &quot;either sell or wind up&quot; Masters hardware and Home Timber and Hardware. Chairman Gordon Cairns said that it would take years to become profitable and that the ongoing losses could not be sustained. On 24 August 2016, it was announced that all Masters stores would close on or before 11 December 2016. It was also announced that Woolworths would sell the Home Timber and Hardware brand to Metcash.

In June 2015, CEO Grant O&#x27;Brien retired and Woolworths went without a CEO until the appointment of Brad Banducci in February 2016. On 25 August 2016, the company announced a loss of $1.235 billion for the 2016 financial year, the biggest loss in the more than 20 years since it has been publicly listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, mainly due to more than $2 billion in write-downs of the failed Masters Home Improvement business and losses in the Big W business.

In April 2016, Woolworths Liquor Group was renamed Endeavour Drinks Group. Woolworths closed all its Thomas Dux stores in 2017; at its peak the brand had 11 stores.

In December 2016, Woolworths announced it would sell its Caltex Woolworths branded petrol stations to British multinational oil and gas company BP for AU$1.75 billion. BP pulled out of the deal in July 2018, saying that sale conditions imposed by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission would make the acquisition commercially unviable. On 9 November 2018, Woolworths announced it would instead sell its petrol stations to the British company EG Group for $1.72 billion, with a 15 year agreement that EG Australia would maintain the Woolworths fuel discount program and enable Woolworths Rewards points to continue to be earned on fuel transactions in its stores. The acquisition was completed on 1 April 2019.

=== New ventures (2019–present) ===
In March 2019, Woolworths launched a stand-alone media business called Cartology to communicate with supplier partners and customers. In April 2019, Woolworths established a venture capital arm called W23.

In July 2019, the Woolworths announced the merger of its hospitality and liquor interests, including BWS, Cellarmasters, Jimmy Brings, Dan Murphy&#x27;s and ALH into a single company, Endeavour Drinks, with Woolworths holding an 85 percent stake in the new entity. Woolworths indicated that it would explore options to divest the newly created Endeavour Drinks business in 2020, subject to shareholder approval at an annual general meeting. Also in 2019, Woolworths admitted to having underpaid its employees by millions of dollars. In 2021, it was revealed that the Woolworths underpayment of staff was more extensive than first thought. More specifically, it was discovered that Woolworths underpaid salaried managers over $700,000 and the Fair Work Ombudsman looked into this further.

In August 2020, Woolworths announced a A$552 million deal to purchase a 65 percent stake in foodservice distributor PFD Food Services, along with the entirety of PFD&#x27;s property portfolio, as part of the company&#x27;s push to expand into the business-to-business wholesale market. In June 2021, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission announced that it would not oppose Woolworths&#x27; PFD deal due to insufficient evidence that the deal would cause a substantial lessening of competition. In 2020, Woolworths was found to have repeatedly ignored consumers who had tried to prevent receipt of marketing emails and had not attempted to improve, despite the AMCA notifying the company that they had received customer complaints. The company was fined A$1,003,800.

In September 2020, Woolworths and pet insurance company PetSure signed a deal to launch a new joint venture called PetCulture. The online business would sell pet insurance, pet food and pet-related products, and veterinary services. Woolworths owns 60 percent of the venture. PetCulture launched in April 2021. That month, Woolworths also paid $223 million to increased its stake in Quantium from 47 percent to 75 percent. Following the transaction, Woolworths and Quantium established a new joint data science and advanced analytics business called Wiq. In October 2020, Woolworths rebranded its supply chain function as Primary Connect with the goal of evolving it into an end-to-end service provider for the group as well as external businesses. In February 2021, Woolworths restructured its red meat business, creating a new standalone division called GreenStock. In 2021, Woolworths launched HealthyLife, an online platform which offers health and wellness advice, products and services.

Having been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Woolworths successfully completed the demerger of its alcohol, hotel, and gambling businesses into a new ASX-listed company, Endeavour Group in June 2021, with the new company holding the Dan Murphy&#x27;s, BWS, AHL, Cellarmasters and Jimmy Brings brands. After the float, Woolworths held a 14.6 percent stake in Endeavour Group. It sold portions of its stake in December 2022 and April 2024, before divesting completely in August 2024.

In February 2022, Woolworths Group rebranded its logo to better represent &quot;what its collective businesses and platforms stand for today&quot;. The company says that it showcases its impact on a &quot;Better Tomorrow [sic]&quot;. It was designed by Re, a business design division of UK-based advertising firm M&amp;C Saatchi.

In May 2022, Woolworths announced a $243 million bid to acquire an 80 percent stake in online marketplace MyDeal from its founder, Sean Senvirtne. The acquisition was finalised in September 2022. In July 2022, Cartology announced it had made a deal to acquire targeted advertising company Shopper Media for $150 million. In December 2022, Woolworths Group said it would acquire a 55 percent stake in pet business Petspiration Group for $586 million. That month, it also signed a deal with SuperPharmacy to acquire the company&#x27;s technology and warehouse assets and rebrand SuperPharmacy&#x27;s six retail stores as HealthyLife Pharmacy. Woolworths will also provide e-commerce and warehousing services to SuperPharmacy. In March 2023, HealthyLife launched telehealth services through a partnership with Global Health, allowing patients to make appointments with doctors, naturopaths and dietitians. That month, Woolworths also announced it would shut down its export business Woolworths International by the end of June 2023.

In May 2023, Woolworths acquired Milkrun, a fast grocery delivery startup which ceased operations the previous month and competed with the supermarket&#x27;s Metro60 delivery service. Woolworths rebranded Metro60 as Milkrun.

In July 2023, Woolworths announced that its New Zealand-based Countdown supermarkets would be rebranded as Woolworths over the next three years commencing early 2024. The NZ$400 million rebrand will be accompanied by the launch of the Everyday Rewards programme for New Zealand consumers. In November 2023, Woolworths launched MarketPlus, a platform for businesses to sell products across its MyDeal, Everyday Market, and Big W Market marketplaces. 

In February 2024, Woolworths announced that Brad Banducci would retire as CEO in September 2024 and a $781 million loss due to major write-downs. Amanda Bardwell, head of WooliesX, is set to succeed Banducci as CEO.

<text>USS &quot;Edsall&quot; (DD-219), was a , the first of two United States Navy ships named after Seaman Norman Eckley Edsall (1873–1899). She was sunk by a combined Japanese air and sea attack, approximately east of Christmas Island on 1 March 1942.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Edsall&quot; was laid down by the William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship and Engine Building Company on 15 September 1919, launched on 29 July 1920 by Mrs Bessie Edsall Bracey, sister of Seaman Edsall, and commissioned on 26 November 1920.
==Service history==
&quot;Edsall&quot; sailed from Philadelphia on 6 December 1920 for San Diego, California for shakedown. She arrived at San Diego 11 January 1921, and remained on the United States West Coast until December, engaging in battle practice and gunnery drills with fleet units. Returning to Charleston, South Carolina, 28 December, &quot;Edsall&quot; departed 26 May 1922 for the Mediterranean.

Arriving at Constantinople on 28 June, &quot;Edsall&quot; joined the U.S. Naval Detachment in Turkish Waters to protect American interests as the Near East was in turmoil with civil strife in Russia, and Greece at war with Turkey.

She was part of the international effort to alleviate the postwar famine in eastern Europe. She helped evacuate refugees, furnishing a center of communications for the Near East and standing by for emergencies. When the Turks expelled the Anatolian Greeks from Smyrna (Izmir), &quot;Edsall&quot; was one of the American destroyers which evacuated refugees. On 14 September 1922, she took 607 refugees off in Smyrna and transported them to Salonika, returning to Smyrna on 16 September to act as flagship for the naval forces there. In October she carried refugees from Smyrna to Mytilene on Lesbos Island. She made repeated visits to ports in Turkey, Bulgaria, Russia, Greece, Egypt, Mandate Palestine, the Syrian Federation, Tunisia, Dalmatia, and Italy, and kept up gunnery and torpedo practice with her sisters until her return to Boston, Massachusetts, for an overhaul on 26 July 1924.

&quot;Edsall&quot; sailed to join the U.S. Asiatic Fleet on 3 January 1925, joining in battle practice and maneuvers at Guantanamo Bay, San Diego, and Pearl Harbor before arriving at Shanghai on 22 June. She was to become a fixture of the Asiatic Fleet on the China coast, in the Philippines and Japan. Her primary duty was protection of American interests in the Far East. She served during the civil war in China, and the early part of the Sino-Japanese War. Battle practice, maneuvers and diplomacy took her most frequently to Shanghai, Yantai, Hankou, Hong Kong, Nanjing, Kobe, Bangkok, and Manila. In late October 1927, &quot;Edsall&quot; visited the Siamese capital Bangkok, and had three of the Royal Princesses aboard for tea. In return &quot;Edsall&quot;″s skipper, Commander Jules James, was given an engraved silver cigarette case by the Thai Royal Family.

===World War II===
On 25 November 1941, two days in advance of the &quot;war warning&quot; which predicted that hostile Japanese action in the Pacific was imminent, Admiral Hart, commander of the Asiatic Fleet, dispatched Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 57 (, , and &quot;Edsall&quot;) with the destroyer tender , to Balikpapan, Borneo, to disperse the surface ships of his fleet from their vulnerable position in Manila Bay.

When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, &quot;Edsall&quot; was en route to Batavia (now Jakarta) with her sister ships when word was received. DesDiv 57 was ordered to Singapore to rendezvous with Royal Navy Force Z. She embarked a British liaison officer and four men at Singapore from and was sent to search for survivors of and , sunk by Japanese aircraft off the east coast of Malaya on 10 December. &quot;Edsall&quot; intercepted a Japanese fishing trawler, &quot;Kofuku Maru&quot; (later renamed and used extensively by Australian special forces) with four small boats in tow and escorted them into Singapore before turning them over to .

&quot;Edsall&quot; and her division joined the heavy cruiser and other US units at Surabaya on 15 December 1941 and escorted shipping retiring to the relative safety of Darwin, Australia. During the first week of 1942 &quot;Edsall&quot; escorted the Pensacola Convoy from Torres Strait back to Darwin.

After fueling operations in the Lesser Sunda Islands, &quot;Edsall&quot; and &quot;Alden&quot; were escorting the Darwin-bound oiler in the Beagle Gulf west of Darwin. On the morning of 20 January 1942 the Imperial Japanese Navy submarine sighted &quot;Trinity&quot;, and misidentifed her as a transport. &quot;I-123&quot; fired four Type 89 torpedoes at shortly after 0630. The sound man aboard &quot;I-123&quot; reported hearing one torpedo hit, but all four torpedoes had missed; &quot;Trinity&quot; had sighted three of them and reported the attack. &quot;Alden&quot; then searched for &quot;I-123&quot;, made a sound contact and conducted a brief depth charge attack at 06:41 before losing contact and abandoning the search.

Later that day, &quot;Edsall&quot; and three Australian corvettes, , , and , sank off Darwin, the first sinking of a full-sized submarine with the involvement of a U.S. destroyer in World War II.

Continuing to escort convoys in northern Australian waters, &quot;Edsall&quot; was damaged when one of her own depth charges exploded during an anti-submarine attack on 23 January 1942 in the shallow — — Howard Channel.

On 3 February, &quot;Edsall&quot; and other American units of ABDA moved up to Tjilatjap, Java in order to be closer to the combat theater and to replenish. She continued as a patrol vessel off southern Java. On 23 February 1942 she and the old gunboat operated off Tjilatjap on antisubmarine patrols.

On 26 February, she steamed from Tjilatjap with her sister ship to rendezvous with the converted seaplane tender , which was bringing in P-40E fighters and U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) personnel for the defense of Java. On 27 February, the three ships were attacked by sixteen Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; bombers of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service&#x27;s &quot;Takao Kōkūtai&quot;, led by Lieutenant Jiro Adachi, flying out of Den Pasar airfield on Bali, escorted by fifteen Mitsubishi A6M2 &quot;Reisen&quot; (Zero) fighters. The attack damaged &quot;Langley&quot; so severely that she had to be scuttled. &quot;Edsall&quot; picked up 177 survivors, and &quot;Whipple&quot; 308.

On 28 February, the two destroyers rendezvoused with the oiler off Flying Fish Cove, Christmas Island some southwest of Tjilatjap. More Japanese bombers forced &quot;Edsall&quot; and other ships to head for open sea. They headed directly south into the Indian Ocean for the rest of 28 February in high winds and heavy seas; between 0430 (USN/local time) and 0815 on 1 March all &quot;Langley&quot;&#x27;s crew were transferred to &quot;Pecos&quot;. &quot;Whipple&quot; then set off for Cocos as protection for the tanker &quot;Belita&quot;. &quot;Pecos&quot;, carrying about 700 survivors from &quot;Langley&quot;, and &quot;Houston&quot;, plus assorted stragglers, was ordered to Australia.

&quot;Edsall&quot; was directed to return to Tjilatjap, carrying 31 USAAF pilots and ground crew who had been passengers on &quot;Langley&quot;. The USAAF personnel were to assemble and fly 27 disassembled and crated P-40 fighters which had been delivered to Tjilatjap aboard the cargo ship . Following orders, at 0830 she headed back to the northeast for Java.

===Last engagement of &quot;Edsall&quot;===
&quot;Pecos&quot; was detected later that morning by air patrols from the carriers of Japanese Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo&#x27;s &quot;Kido Butai&quot; (or &quot;KdB&quot;) and came under heavy air attack. For some time she sent out distress calls to any Allied ships in the area, as it was assumed the ship would probably be lost. &quot;Whipple&quot;, less than distant, received some of these calls, but was too far away to return quickly. , a troopship many hundreds of miles away in the Indian Ocean also read some of the signals. At approximately 1548 hours &quot;Pecos&quot; sank after being attacked for several hours by four waves of IJN dive-bombers from Nagumo&#x27;s &quot;KdB&quot;.

At 1550 hours (USN/local time) the Japanese task force spotted a single &quot;light cruiser&quot; about behind the force, approximately south southeast of Christmas Island; this was in fact &quot;Edsall&quot;. The destroyer was perhaps no more than from the last reported position of &quot;Pecos&quot; and probably attempting to get to her stricken comrades. At about 1603 hours she was seen from the Japanese heavy cruiser , and within five minutes the cruiser opened fire with her guns. Fifteen minutes later the battleships of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa&#x27;s &quot;Sentai&quot; 3/1 ( and ) opened fire with their main battery of guns at extreme range (). All shots missed as the destroyer conducted evasive maneuvers that ranged from flank speed, about , to full stop, with radical turns and intermittent smoke-screens. &quot;Edsall&quot; also disrupted the Japanese by counter-attacking with her torpedoes and 4-inch guns. She signalled that she had been surprised by two enemy battleships; this was copied by the Dutch merchant ship &quot;Siantar&quot; more than away. The skill shown by &quot;Edsall&quot; in dodging extensive shelling during an extended engagement reportedly led some of the Japanese naval personnel involved to refer to the American vessel as &quot;the dancing mouse&quot;. 

The Japanese surface vessels (2 cruisers, 2 battleships) fired 1,335 shells at &quot;Edsall&quot; that afternoon, with no more than one or two hits, which failed to stop the destroyer. Vice Admiral Nagumo ordered airstrikes: 26 Type 99 dive bombers (Aichi D3A) () in three groups () took off from the carriers (8), (9), and (9). The dive bombers were led by Lieutenants Ogawa, Kobayashi, and Koite respectively. Their bombs immobilised &quot;Edsall&quot; with one hit and one miss near enough to do damage.

At 17:22 the Japanese ships resumed firing on the destroyer. A Japanese cameraman, probably on the cruiser , filmed about 90 seconds of her destruction. (A single frame from this film was culled for use as a propaganda photo later, misidentified as &quot;the British destroyer HMS Pope&quot;.) Finally, at 17:31 hrs (19:01 IJN/Tokyo time) &quot;Edsall&quot; rolled onto her side, &quot;showing her red bottom&quot; according to an officer aboard the , and sank amid clouds of steam and smoke in of water some east of Christmas Island. The Japanese report after action described the sinking of &quot;Edsall&quot; as a fiasco. The Imperial Japanese Navy revised rules of engagement for battleships and cruisers against destroyers.

&quot;Edsall&quot; received two battle stars for her World War II service.

==Later developments==

===The fate of &quot;Edsall&quot; survivors===
Japanese Imperial Navy officers aboard the cruiser &quot;Chikuma&quot; several years later reported that a number of men may have survived the sinking of &quot;Edsall&quot; as they were found in the water on liferafts, cutters or clinging to debris. However, due to a submarine alert, the Japanese only stopped long enough to rescue a handful before they received orders to retire, leaving the others to perish in the Indian Ocean.

Onboard &quot;Chikuma&quot;, the survivors were interrogated by their captors; the name of their ship was recorded as &quot;the old destroyer E-do-soo-ru&quot;. After a few days, the details of these interrogations were provided to the other ships of Nagumo&#x27;s &quot;Kido Butai&quot; during their return journey. There is some suggestion that the cruiser &quot;Tone&quot; may have picked up a survivor or two as well, but there is no confirming evidence of this. The Americans were held on &quot;Chikuma&quot; for the next ten days before returning to the Japanese force&#x27;s advance base on 11 March 1942.

===Mass grave===
On 21 September 1946, several mass graves were opened in a remote locale in the East Indies, over from where &quot;Edsall&quot; had disappeared. Two graves contained 34 decapitated bodies, among which were the remains of six &quot;Edsall&quot; crewmen and what are thought to be five USAAF personnel from &quot;Langley&quot;, along with Javanese, Chinese, and Dutch merchant sailors from the Dutch merchant-ship &quot;Modjokerto&quot;, sunk on the same day and in the same general area as &quot;Edsall&quot;. The American bodies were reinterred in U.S. cemeteries between December 1949 and March 1950. War crimes trials conducted in 1946–1948 concerning other murders that occurred in or near Kendari by IJN personnel recorded fragmentary information about the killings of &quot;Edsall&quot; survivors, but were not recognized as such by Allied investigators, and were not pursued.

===L. Ron Hubbard claim===
L. Ron Hubbard claimed that he had served on &quot;Edsall&quot; during World War II and that, following her sinking, he swam to shore and remained in the jungle as the ship&#x27;s sole survivor. He claimed that this is where he was during the bombing of Pearl Harbor, although &quot;Edsall&quot; had been sunk in 1942, and the U.S. Navy has no record of his service on the ship. Navy records show that Hubbard was in training in New York when the war broke out. He was supposed to be posted to the Philippines, but his ship was diverted to Australia. There he angered the US naval attaché for assuming &quot;unauthorized duties&quot;; he was relieved from his assignment and returned to the United States.

===Wreck discovery===
The wreck of &quot;Edsall&quot; was located in mid-2023 roughly 200 miles east of Christmas Island at a depth of 18,000 feet. It was discovered by the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s during an undisclosed, unrelated mission in the region. The announcement of the wreck was delayed until Veterans Day in the United States, concurrently with Remembrance Day in the UK and Australia, in 2024.

<text>USS &quot;Porter&quot; (DD-356) was the lead ship of her class of destroyers in the United States Navy. She was the third Navy ship named for Commodore David Porter and his son, Admiral David Dixon Porter.

==Operational history==
===Construction===
&quot;Porter&quot; was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden in New Jersey on 18 December 1933, launched on 12 December 1935 by Miss Carlile Patterson Porter and commissioned at Philadelphia on 27 August 1936.

===1936–1941===
After shakedown in waters off Northern Europe, &quot;Porter&quot; visited St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, for ceremonies in honor of the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in May 1937 and was at the Washington Navy Yard during the Boy Scout Jamboree, June–July 1937. Then reassigned to the Pacific Fleet, she transited the Panama Canal and arrived at San Francisco, California 5 August 1937. She operated continuously with the Pacific Fleet until the outbreak of World War II, homeported at San Diego, California.

===World War II===
On 5 December 1941, &quot;Porter&quot; got underway from Pearl Harbor, escaping the Japanese attack by two days. She patrolled with cruisers and destroyers in Hawaiian waters before steaming in convoy 25 March 1942 for the west coast. She operated off the west coast with Task Force 1 (TF 1) for the next 4 months. Returning to Pearl Harbor in mid-August, she trained in Hawaiian waters until 16 October when she sortied with TF 16 and headed for the Solomon Islands.

====Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands====
On 26 October 1942, TF 16 exchanged air attacks with strong Japanese forces northeast of Guadalcanal in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. During the ensuing action, &quot;Porter&quot; was torpedoed, and, after the crew had abandoned ship, was sunk by gunfire from , which unlike the &quot;Porter&quot;, hadn&#x27;t escaped the attack on Pearl Harbor. Authorities differ as to the source of the torpedo which sank &quot;Porter&quot;. Author Eric Hammel states &quot;Porter&quot; was sunk by a single torpedo, part of a three-torpedo spread fired from Japanese submarine . However, author Richard B. Frank states that Japanese records do not support this, and that, more likely, an errant torpedo from a ditching US Navy Grumman TBF Avenger hit &quot;Porter&quot; and caused the fatal damage. Her name was struck from the Navy List 2 November 1942.

&quot;Porter&quot; earned one battle star for World War II service.

<text>Onopordum acanthium (cotton thistle, [[Thistle#Scottish thistle|Scotch (or Scottish) thistle]]) is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and Western Asia from the Iberian Peninsula east to Kazakhstan, and north to central Scandinavia, and widely naturalised elsewhere, with especially large populations present in the United States and Australia. It is a vigorous biennial plant with coarse, spiny leaves and conspicuous spiny-winged stems.

It should not be confused with &quot;Cirsium vulgare&quot; (spear thistle), which is also known as Scotch or Scottish thistle and is the national flower of Scotland. Spear thistle is native to Britain, while cotton thistle is non-native.

==Description==

It is a biennial plant, producing a large rosette of spiny leaves the first year. The plants typically germinate in the autumn after the first rains and exist as rosettes throughout the first year, forming a stout, fleshy taproot that may extend down or more for a food reserve.

In the second year, the plant can grow to as much as tall with a width of up to . The leaves are wide, alternate, spiny, and often covered with white woolly hairs with the lower surface more densely covered than the upper. The leaves are deeply lobed with long, stiff spines along the margins. Fine hairs give the plant a greyish appearance. The massive main stem may be wide at the base and branched in the upper part. Each stem has a vertical row of broad, spiny wings (conspicuous ribbon-like leafy material), typically wide, extending to the base of the flower head.

The flowers are globe shaped, in diameter, from dark pink to lavender, and are produced in the summer. The flower buds form first at the tip of the stem and later at the tip of the axillary branches. They appear singly or in groups of two or three on branch tips. The plants are androgynous, with both pistil and stamens, and sit above numerous, long, stiff, spine-tipped bracts, all pointing outwards, the lower ones wider apart and pointing downwards. After flowering, the ovary starts swelling and forms about 8,400 to 40,000 seeds per plant.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Cotton thistle is native to Europe and Asia. The plant prefers habitats with dry summers, such as the Mediterranean region, growing best in sandy clay and calcareous soils which are rich in ammonium salts. It grows in ruderal places, as well as in dry pastures and fields. Its preferred habitats are natural areas, disturbed sites, roadsides, fields, and especially sites with fertile soils, agricultural areas, range/grasslands, riparian zones, scrub/shrublands valleys and plains along with water courses. Temperature and moisture, rather than soil nutrient concentrations, determine the ecological performance of Onopordum species.

In Europe, the plant tends to colonise disturbed pastures. In its native range, cotton thistle is considered a weak competitor that needs regeneration gaps to develop and maintain stands; populations tend to retreat when disturbance ceases. The plant has been widely introduced at mid-latitudes across much of North America.

Scotch thistles can spread rapidly. For example, it was first found in Utah in 1963. By 1981, it covered approximately 6070 hectares in 17 counties. Eight years later, it had spread to cover more than 22,540 hectares in 22 counties.

==Ecology==
&quot;Onopordum acanthium&quot; reproduces by seeds only. Most seeds germinate in autumn after the first rains, but some seeds can germinate year round under favourable moisture and temperature conditions. Seeds that germinate in late autumn become biennials. When they germinate earlier, they can behave as annuals. Buried seed can remain viable in the soil seed bank for at least seven years, possibly for up to twenty years or more. Yearly seed production and seed dormancy are highly variable, depending on environmental conditions.

The slender and smooth achenes are about 3 mm long, brown with gray markings. They are tipped with a pappus of slender bristles. Mainly locally dispersed by wind, or more widely by humans, birds, wildlife, livestock or streams, the seeds are sensitive to light and only germinate when close to the surface. Seedlings will emerge from soil depths up to 4.5 cm, 0.5 cm are optimal. While some seeds will germinate in the dark, most germination occurs with alternating light/dark cycles, with an optimal day length of eight hours.

The leaves of cotton thistle are eaten by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera, such as the thistle ermine (&quot;Myelois circumvoluta&quot;).

==Taxonomy and naming==
Three subspecies are accepted:
*&quot;Onopordum acanthium&quot; subsp. &quot;acanthium&quot;. Most of the species&#x27; range.
*&quot;Onopordum acanthium&quot; subsp. &quot;gautieri&quot; (Rouy) Franco. France, Spain.
*&quot;Onopordum acanthium&quot; subsp. &quot;parnassicum&quot; (Boiss. &amp; Heldr.) Nyman. Greece.

The genus botanical name is derived from the Ancient Greek words &quot;όνος&quot; (ónos=donkey), &quot;πέρδω&quot; (pérdo=to fart), and &quot;άκανθος&quot; (ácanthos=thorn), meaning &#x27;donkey fart thorny food&#x27;.

The common name of cotton thistle refers to the cotton-like hairs on the leaves. Other names are Scots thistle or Scottish thistle, heraldic thistle and woolly thistle. The name Scots thistle refers to the flower used as the national emblem of Scotland. However, this is &quot;Cirsium vulgare&quot;., not onopordum.

==Uses==
It is grown as an ornamental plant for its bold foliage and large flowers. It has been used to treat cancers and ulcers and to diminish discharges of mucous membranes. A recent study of a crude extract from the leaves of the plant demonstrated activity against glioblastoma, a type of very malignant brain tumor. The receptacle was eaten in earlier times like an artichoke. The cottony hairs on the stem have been occasionally collected to stuff pillows. Oil from the seeds has been used for burning and cooking.

Thistles produce abundant nectar for pollinators and provide seeds and floss for birds such as the goldfinch. Large-flowered tall thistles in particular provide considerable nectar.

==Invasive species==
In the late 19th century, it was introduced to temperate regions of North America, South America, and Australia as an ornamental plant, and is now considered a major agricultural and wildland noxious weed. It has been recorded from nearly 50 countries. It is difficult to eradicate because of its drought resistance. It can spread rapidly and eventually dense stands prohibit foraging by livestock. Infestations of cotton thistle often start in disturbed areas such as roadways, campsites, burned areas, and ditch banks. The weed adapts best to areas along rivers and streams, but can be a serious problem in pastures, grain fields and range areas. A single plant is imposing enough, but an entire colony can ruin a pasture or destroy a park or campsite, sometimes forming tall, dense, impenetrable stands. This issue is often amplified by the prolific thorns found on this species. Besides creating an impenetrable barrier to humans and animals, the plant nearly eliminates forage use by livestock and some mammal species such as deer and elk.

In the United States, known infestations include most of the Pacific Northwest along with Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Nebraska, and South Dakota. On western rangeland, infestations directly result in significant economic losses for ranchers. It is also widespread in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia it commonly hybridises with the related invasive &quot;Onopordum illyricum&quot;.

===Control===
;Mechanical
Small infestations may be physically removed or cut a few centimetres below the soil surface ensuring that no leaves remain attached to prevent regrowth. Mowing during early flowering will not kill the plant but will reduce seed production. Repeated treatments may be required because populations typically exhibit a wide range of developmental stages among individual plants. Slashing should be done prior to flowering since seed may mature in the seed head after cutting. Plants should not be mowed following seed set, as this increases chances for seed dispersal.

;Chemical
Because of their shorter life cycle, cotton thistle plants can be effectively treated with herbicides. All herbicide treatments should be applied at the rosette stage of the plant. Generally, herbicide applications would be in early spring or autumn. One of the primary difficulties in chemical control of cotton thistles is their ability to germinate nearly year round. From autumn to spring a range of plant sizes can be found which may result in variable success from chemical control. Herbicides are very effective on seedlings and young rosettes, but control becomes more variable with increasing plant age. &quot;Onopordum&quot; spp. seeds may persist for several years in the soil. Buried seed may persist for up to twenty years, and reinfestation is likely without yearly management. Therefore, several years of re-treatment may be necessary. Picloram, dicamba, 2,4-D, dicamba + 2,4,-D, and metsulfuron are effective for controlling cotton thistle. Clopyralid is more selective for controlling plants in the family Asteraceae, but will also injure or kill legumes.

;Biological
There are no biological control agents that have been specifically released for cotton thistle control in the United States. A thistle head weevil &quot;Rhinocyllus conicus&quot; that feeds on &quot;Carduus pycnocephalus&quot; has also been shown to feed on cotton thistle. This insect was the object of imprudent biological control introduction, and it became an invasive species that has threatened endangered native thistles in North America (Strong 1997). Establishment of this thistle head weevil as a biological control agent for cotton thistle has been unsuccessful in the Pacific Northwest. A thistle crown weevil (&quot;Trichosirocalus horridus&quot;) that feeds on musk, bull, plumeless, Italian, and creeping thistles will also feed on cotton thistle. In Australia, this insect has been shown to kill cotton thistle rosettes. The related &quot;Trichosirocalus briese&quot; is also being tested as a control agent. The Australian painted lady butterfly has been known to use this invasive species as a host plant, but the larvae do not do enough damage to the plant for this butterfly to be used as biological control agent.

In Australia, a total of seven insects have been released to control cotton thistle. Two of the seven released insects are weevils, including &quot;Larinus latus&quot; which feeds on the seeds, and &quot;Lixus cardui&quot;, which bores in the stems.

;Integrated management
A combination of methods (IPM) is often more effective than any single method. An integrated pest management plan deals with prevention as well as control. Eradication of weed species is often not a practical goal, but in many cases reducing infestation to manageable levels is an achievable objective. Seed bank longevity is a major factor in managing cotton thistles. Re-establishing competitive perennial grasses and monitoring infested areas on a yearly basis is critical. Herbicides can successfully be used for reducing thistle populations and giving grasses a competitive advantage, but they cannot be used as a stand-alone solution. These techniques must be linked with good grazing practices in rangeland areas. Otherwise, the thistles will recolonize and rapidly replenish the seed bank to pre-control levels.

<doc id="514897" wikidata="Q699669" url="?curid=514897" title="Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands">
<text>The Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, fought during 25–27 October 1942, sometimes referred to as the Battle of Santa Cruz or Third Battle of Solomon Sea, in Japan as the Battle of the South Pacific ( &quot;Minamitaiheiyō kaisen&quot;), was the fourth aircraft carrier battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II. It was also the fourth major naval engagement fought between the United States Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy during the lengthy and strategically important Guadalcanal campaign. As in the battles of the Coral Sea, Midway, and the Eastern Solomons, the ships of the two adversaries were rarely in sight or gun range of each other. Instead, almost all attacks by both sides were mounted by carrier- or land-based aircraft.

In an attempt to drive Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby islands and end the stalemate that had existed since September 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army planned a major ground offensive on Guadalcanal for 20–25 October 1942. In support of this offensive, and with the hope of engaging Allied naval forces, Japanese carriers and other large warships moved into a position near the southern Solomon Islands. From this location, the Japanese naval forces hoped to engage and decisively defeat any Allied (primarily U.S.) naval forces, especially carrier forces, that responded to the ground offensive. Allied naval forces also hoped to meet the Japanese naval forces in battle, with the same objectives of breaking the stalemate and decisively defeating their adversary.

The Japanese ground offensive on Guadalcanal was underway with the Battle for Henderson Field while the naval warships and aircraft from the two adversaries confronted each other on the morning of 26 October 1942, just north of the Santa Cruz Islands. After an exchange of carrier air attacks, Allied surface ships retreated from the battle area with the fleet carrier sunk, and another fleet carrier, , heavily damaged. The participating Japanese carrier forces also retired because of the Japanese army’s failure to capture Henderson Field.

Santa Cruz was a tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of both tonnage and control of the seas around Guadalcanal. However, Japan&#x27;s loss of many irreplaceable veteran aircrews proved to be a long-term strategic advantage for the Allies, whose aircrew losses in the battle were relatively low and were quickly replaced. The Japanese had hoped for, and needed, a larger, decisive victory. The fact that the naval battle was won just after the land battle was lost meant that the opportunity to exploit their victory in the battle had already passed.

==Background==
On 8 August 1942, Allied forces, predominantly from the United States, landed on Japanese-occupied Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia, and to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign with the eventual goal of neutralizing the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign. The landings initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign.

After the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24–25 August, in which the fleet carrier was heavily damaged and forced to sail to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for a month of major repairs, three U.S. carrier task forces remained in the South Pacific area. The task forces were based around the fleet carriers , , and plus their respective air groups and supporting surface warships, including battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, and were primarily stationed between the Solomons and New Hebrides (Vanuatu) islands. In this area of operations, the carriers were charged with guarding the line of communication between the major Allied bases at New Caledonia and Espiritu Santo, supporting the Allied ground forces at Guadalcanal and Tulagi against any Japanese counteroffensives, covering the movement of supply ships to Guadalcanal, and engaging and destroying any Japanese warships, especially carriers, that came within range. The area of ocean in which the U.S. carrier task forces operated was known as &quot;Torpedo Junction&quot; by U.S. forces because of the high concentration of Japanese submarines in the area.
On 31 August, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was torpedoed by and was out of action for three months for repairs.

On 15 September, &quot;Wasp&quot; was hit by three torpedoes fired by Japanese submarine while supporting a major reinforcement and resupply convoy to Guadalcanal and almost engaging the Japanese carriers and , which withdrew just before the two adversaries came into range of each other&#x27;s aircraft. With power knocked out from torpedo damage, &quot;Wasp&quot;″s damage-control teams were unable to contain the ensuing large fires, and she was abandoned and scuttled.

Although the U.S. now had only one operational carrier, &quot;Hornet&quot;, in the South Pacific, the Allies still maintained air superiority over the southern Solomon Islands because of their aircraft based at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. However, at night, when aircraft were not able to operate effectively, the Japanese were able to operate their ships around Guadalcanal almost at will. Thus, a stalemate in the battle for Guadalcanal developedthe Allies delivered supplies and reinforcements to Guadalcanal during the day, and the Japanese did the same by warship, referred to as the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot; by the Allies, at nightwith neither side able to deliver enough troops to the island to secure a decisive advantage. By mid-October, both sides had roughly an equal number of troops on the island. The stalemate was briefly interrupted by two large-ship naval actions. On the night of 11–12 October, a U.S. naval force intercepted and defeated a Japanese naval force en route to bombard Henderson Field in the Battle of Cape Esperance. But just two nights later, a Japanese force that included the battleships and successfully bombarded Henderson Field, destroying most of the U.S. aircraft there and inflicting severe damage on the field&#x27;s facilities.
The U.S. made two moves to try to break the stalemate in the battle for Guadalcanal. First, repairs to &quot;Enterprise&quot; were expedited so that she could return to the South Pacific as soon as possible. On 10 October, &quot;Enterprise&quot; received her new air group (Air Group 10) and on 16 October, she left Pearl Harbor; and on 23 October, she arrived back in the South Pacific and rendezvoused with &quot;Hornet&quot; and the rest of the Allied South Pacific naval forces on 24 October, northeast of Espiritu Santo.

Second, on 18 October, Admiral Chester Nimitz, Allied Commander-in-Chief of Pacific Forces, replaced Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley with Vice Admiral William Halsey, Jr. as Commander, South Pacific Area: this position commanded Allied forces involved in the Solomon Islands campaign. Nimitz felt that Ghormley had become too myopic and pessimistic to lead Allied forces effectively in the struggle for Guadalcanal. Halsey was reportedly respected throughout the U.S. naval fleet as a &quot;fighter&quot;. Upon assuming command, Halsey immediately began making plans to draw the Japanese naval forces into a battle, writing to Nimitz, &quot;I had to begin throwing punches almost immediately.&quot;

The Japanese Combined Fleet was also seeking to draw Allied naval forces into what was hoped to be a decisive battle. Two fleet carriers— and , as well as the light carrier —arrived at the main Japanese naval base at Truk Atoll from Japan in early October and joined &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot;. With five carriers fully equipped with air groups, plus their numerous battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, the Japanese Combined Fleet, directed by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, was confident that it could make up for the defeat at the Battle of Midway. Apart from a couple of air raids on Henderson Field in October, the Japanese carriers and their supporting warships stayed in the northwestern area of the Solomon Islands, out of the battle for Guadalcanal and waiting for a chance to approach and engage the U.S. carriers. With the Japanese Army&#x27;s next planned major ground attack on Allied forces on Guadalcanal set for 20 October, Yamamoto&#x27;s warships began to move towards the southern Solomons to support the offensive and to be ready to engage any enemy ships, especially carriers, that approached to support the Allied defenses on Guadalcanal.

==Prelude==
On or around 11 October a large force consisting of aircraft carriers, battleships, and their escorts departed Truk for an extended sortie in support of an October Guadalcanal offensive. On the same day a major reinforcement convoy reached Guadalcanal, but a force of supporting heavy cruisers was prevented from bombarding Henderson Field and turned back in what became known as the Battle of Cape Esperance. What followed were three heavy bombardment missions conducted by battleships and heavy cruisers between 13 October and 16 October (this was the heaviest naval attack on the airfield in the entire campaign), the first and third of those conducted by vessels detached from Vice admiral Nobutake Kondō&#x27;s Advance Force. Starting midnight on 14 October, another major convoy consisting of four transports unloaded the bulk of their cargo successfully, including tanks and heavy artillery. On 15 October, the destroyer , while escorting the tug &quot;Vireo&quot; pulling a resupply barge, was spotted and sunk by aircraft from &quot;Zuikaku&quot; and &quot;Shokaku&quot;. On 17 October, &quot;Hiyō&quot; and &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; launched a strike force to attack transports off Lunga Point, but caused no damage. The large body of warships would remain in the waters around Guadalcanal until after fighting in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands had ceased and returned to Truk at the end of October. The recently commissioned carrier &quot;Hiyō&quot; was originally part of the fleet, but a fire in her engineering room on 21 October forced her to retire to Truk for repairs. On 25 October, 6 bombers and 12 fighters from &quot;Jun&#x27;yo&quot; attacked Henderson Field, but did little damage.

From 20 to 25 October, Japanese land forces on Guadalcanal attempted to capture Henderson Field with a large-scale attack against the U.S. defenders. The attack was decisively defeated with heavy casualties for the Japanese. Incorrectly believing that the Japanese army troops had succeeded in capturing Henderson Field, the Japanese sent warships from the Shortland Islands toward Guadalcanal on the morning of 25 October to support their ground forces on the island. Aircraft from Henderson Field attacked the convoy throughout the day, sinking the light cruiser (with some help from B-17s out of Espiritu Santo) and damaging the destroyer .
Despite the failure of the Japanese ground offensive and the loss of &quot;Yura&quot;, the rest of the Combined Fleet continued to maneuver near the southern Solomon Islands on 25 October in the hope of engaging Allied naval forces in a battle. The Japanese naval forces now comprised four carriers (two large, one medium, one light), &quot;Hiyō&quot; having departed, with a combined aircraft complement of approximately three &quot;Shokaku&quot;-class fleet carriers.

The Japanese naval forces were divided into three groups: the &quot;Advanced&quot; force of &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot;, four heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and seven destroyers commanded by Kondō in heavy cruiser with a support group consisting of two battleships and two destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Takeo Kurita; the &quot;Main Body&quot; of &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, and &quot;Zuihō&quot; plus one heavy cruiser and eight destroyers, commanded by Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo aboard &quot;Shōkaku&quot;; and the &quot;Vanguard&quot; force of two battleships, three heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and seven destroyers, commanded by Rear Admiral Hiroaki Abe in the battleship . In addition to commanding the Advanced force, Kondo acted as the overall commander of the three forces.

On the U.S. side, the &quot;Hornet&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; task groups, under the overall command of Rear Admiral Thomas Kinkaid, swept around to the north of the Santa Cruz Islands on 25 October, searching for the Japanese naval forces. The U.S. warships were deployed as two separate carrier groups, separated from each other by about . A U.S. PBY Catalina reconnaissance seaplane based in the Santa Cruz Islands located the Japanese Main Body carriers at 11:03. However, the Japanese carriers were about from the U.S. force, just beyond carrier aircraft range. Kinkaid, hoping to close the range to be able to execute an attack that day, steamed towards the Japanese carriers at top speed and, at 14:25, launched a strike force of 23 aircraft. But the Japanese, knowing that they had been spotted by U.S. aircraft and not knowing where the U.S. carriers were, turned to the north to stay out of range of the U.S. carriers&#x27; aircraft. Thus, the U.S. strike force returned to its carriers without finding or attacking the Japanese warships.

==Battle==

===Carrier action on 26 October: first strikes===
At 02:50 on 26 October, the Japanese naval forces reversed direction and the naval forces of the two adversaries closed the distance until they were only away from each other by 05:00. Both sides launched search aircraft and prepared their remaining aircraft to attack as soon as the other side&#x27;s ships were located. Although a radar-equipped Catalina sighted the Japanese carriers at 03:10, the report did not reach Kinkaid until 05:12. Therefore, believing that the Japanese ships had probably changed position during the intervening two hours, he decided to withhold launching a strike force until he received more current information on the location of the Japanese ships.
At 06:45, a U.S. scout aircraft sighted the carriers of Nagumo&#x27;s main body. At 06:58, a Japanese scout aircraft reported the location of &quot;Hornet&quot;″s task force. Both sides raced to be the first to attack the other. The Japanese were first to get their strike force launched, with 64 aircraft, including 21 Aichi D3A2 dive bombers, 20 Nakajima B5N2 torpedo bombers, 21 A6M3 Zero fighters, and 2 Nakajima B5N2 contact aircraft on the way towards &quot;Hornet&quot; by 07:40. This first strike was commanded by Lieutenant Commander Shigeharu Murata, while the fighter cover was led by Lieutenants Ayao Shirane and Saneyasu Hidaka. Also at 07:40, two U.S. SBD-3 Dauntless scout aircraft, responding to the earlier sighting of the Japanese carriers, arrived and dove on &quot;Zuihō&quot;. With the Japanese combat air patrol (CAP) busy chasing other U.S. scout aircraft away, the two U.S. aircraft were able to hit &quot;Zuihō&quot; with both their 500-pound bombs, causing heavy damage and preventing the carrier&#x27;s flight deck from being able to land aircraft.

Meanwhile, Kondo ordered Abe&#x27;s Vanguard force to race ahead to try to intercept and engage the U.S. warships. Kondo also brought his own Advanced force forward at flank speed so that &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot;″s aircraft could join in the attacks on the U.S. ships. At 08:10, &quot;Shōkaku&quot; launched a second wave of strike aircraft, consisting of 19 dive bombers and five Zeros, and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; launched 16 torpedo bombers and 4 Zeros at 08:40. The second strike leader was Lieutenant Commander Mamoru Seki, while the fighter cover was led by Lieutenant Hideki Shingo. Thus, by 09:10 the Japanese had over 100 aircraft on the way to attack the U.S. carriers.

The U.S. strike aircraft were running about 20 minutes behind the Japanese. Believing that a speedy attack was more important than a massed attack, and because they lacked fuel to spend time assembling prior to the strike, the U.S. aircraft proceeded in small groups towards the Japanese ships, rather than forming into a single large strike force. The first group—consisting of 15 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, 6 Grumman TBF-1 Avenger torpedo bombers, and eight Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters, led by Lieutenant Commander William J. &quot;Gus&quot; Widhelm from &quot;Hornet&quot;—was on its way by about 08:00. A second group—consisting of three SBDs, nine TBFs (including the Air Group Commander&#x27;s), and eight Wildcats from &quot;Enterprise&quot;, led by Lieutenant Commander John A. Collett—was off by 08:10. A third group—consisting of nine SBDs, ten TBFs (including the Air Group Commander&#x27;s), and seven F4Fs from &quot;Hornet&quot;—was on its way by 08:20.

At 08:40, the opposing aircraft strike formations passed within sight of each other. Lieutenant Hidaka&#x27;s nine &quot;Zuihō&quot; Zeros surprised and attacked the &quot;Enterprise&quot; group, attacking the climbing aircraft from out of the sun. In the resulting engagement, four Zeros, three Wildcats, and two TBFs, including Collett&#x27;s, were shot down, with another two TBFs and a Wildcat forced to return to &quot;Enterprise&quot; with heavy damage. The remaining &quot;Zuihō&quot; Zeros, having exhausted their ammunition, withdrew from the action.
At 08:50, the lead U.S. attack formation from &quot;Hornet&quot; spotted four ships from Abe&#x27;s Vanguard force. Pressing on, the U.S. aircraft sighted the Japanese carriers and prepared to attack. Three Zeros from &quot;Zuihō&quot; attacked the formation&#x27;s Wildcats, drawing them away from the bombers they were assigned to protect. Thus, the dive bombers in the first group initiated their attacks without fighter escort. Twelve Zeros from the Japanese carrier CAP attacked the SBD formation, shot down two (including Widhelm&#x27;s, though he survived), and forced two more to abort. The remaining 11 SBDs commenced their attack dives on &quot;Shōkaku&quot; at 09:27, hitting her with three to six bombs, wrecking her flight deck, and causing serious damage to the interior of the ship. The final SBD of the 11 lost track of &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and instead dropped its bomb near the Japanese destroyer , causing minor damage. The six TBFs in the first strike force, having become separated from their strike group, did not find the Japanese carriers and eventually turned back towards &quot;Hornet&quot;. On the way back, they attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser , missing with all their torpedoes.

The TBFs of the second U.S. attack formation from &quot;Enterprise&quot; were unable to locate the Japanese carriers and instead attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser from Abe&#x27;s Vanguard force but caused no damage. At about the same time, nine SBDs from the third U.S. attack formation—from &quot;Hornet&quot;—found Abe&#x27;s ships and attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser , hitting her with two bombs and causing heavy damage. The three &quot;Enterprise&quot; SBDs then arrived and also attacked &quot;Chikuma&quot;, causing more damage with one bomb hit and two near-misses. Finally, the nine TBFs from the third strike group arrived and attacked the smoking &quot;Chikuma&quot;, scoring one more bomb hit. &quot;Chikuma&quot;, escorted by two destroyers, withdrew from the battle and headed towards Truk for repairs.

The U.S. carrier forces received word from their outbound strike aircraft at 08:30 that Japanese attack aircraft were headed their way. At 08:52, the Japanese strike force commander sighted the &quot;Hornet&quot; task force—the &quot;Enterprise&quot; task force was hidden by a rain squall—and deployed his aircraft for attack. At 08:55, the U.S. carriers detected the approaching Japanese aircraft on radar—about away—and began to vector the 37 Wildcats of their CAP to engage the incoming Japanese aircraft. However, communication problems, mistakes by the U.S. fighter control directors, and primitive control procedures prevented all but a few of the Wildcats from engaging the Japanese aircraft before they began their attacks on &quot;Hornet&quot;. Although the U.S. CAP, including fighter pilot Swede Vejtasa, was able to shoot down or damage several dive bombers (the formation leader Lieutenant Sadamu Takahashi had to abort the dive due to the damage), most of the Japanese aircraft commenced their attacks relatively unmolested by U.S. fighters.

At 09:09, the anti-aircraft guns of &quot;Hornet&quot; and her escorting warships opened fire as the 20 untouched Japanese torpedo planes and remaining 16 dive bombers commenced their attacks on the carrier. At 09:12, a dive bomber placed its 250 kg semi-armor-piercing &quot;ordinary&quot; bomb dead center on &quot;Hornet&quot;″s flight deck, across from the island, which penetrated three decks before exploding, killing 60 men. Moments later, a 242 kg high-explosive &quot;land&quot; bomb struck the flight deck, detonating on impact to create an hole and kill 30 men. A minute or so later, a third bomb hit &quot;Hornet&quot; near where the first bomb hit, penetrating three decks before exploding, causing severe damage but no loss of life. At 09:14, a dive bomber was set on fire by &quot;Hornet&quot;″s anti-aircraft guns; the pilot, Warrant Officer Shigeyuki Sato, deliberately crashed into &quot;Hornet&quot;″s stack, killing seven men and spreading burning aviation fuel over the signal deck.

At the same time as the dive bombers were attacking, the 20 torpedo bombers were also approaching &quot;Hornet&quot; from two different directions. Despite suffering heavy losses from anti-aircraft fire, including Murata, the torpedo planes planted two torpedoes in &quot;Hornet&quot;″s side between 09:13 and 09:17, knocking out her engines. As &quot;Hornet&quot; came to a stop, a damaged Japanese dive bomber approached and purposely crashed into the carrier&#x27;s side, starting a fire near the ship&#x27;s main supply of aviation fuel. At 09:20, the surviving Japanese aircraft departed, leaving &quot;Hornet&quot; dead in the water and burning. Twenty-five Japanese and six American aircraft were destroyed in this attack, including 12 dive bombers, ten torpedo planes and at least one Zero.

With the assistance of fire hoses from three escorting destroyers, the fires on &quot;Hornet&quot; were under control by 10:00. Wounded personnel were evacuated from the carrier, and an attempt was made by the heavy cruiser under Captain Willard A. Kitts to tow &quot;Hornet&quot; away from the battle area. However, the effort to rig the towline took some time, and more attack waves of Japanese aircraft were inbound.

===Carrier action on 26 October: post-first strike actions===
Starting at 09:30, &quot;Enterprise&quot; landed many of the damaged and fuel-depleted CAP fighters and returning scout aircraft from both carriers. However, with her flight deck full, and the second wave of incoming Japanese aircraft detected on radar at 09:30, &quot;Enterprise&quot; ceased landing operations at 10:00. Fuel-depleted aircraft then began ditching in the ocean, and the carrier&#x27;s escorting destroyers rescued the aircrews. One of the ditching aircraft, a damaged TBF from &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s strike force that had been attacked earlier by Zeros from &quot;Zuihō&quot;, crashed into the water near the destroyer . As &quot;Porter&quot; rescued the TBF&#x27;s aircrew, she was struck by a torpedo, possibly from the ditched aircraft, causing heavy damage and killing 15 crewmen. After the task force commander ordered the destroyer scuttled, the crew was rescued by the destroyer which then sank &quot;Porter&quot; with gunfire ().

As the first wave of Japanese strike aircraft began returning to their carriers from their attack on &quot;Hornet&quot;, one of them spotted the &quot;Enterprise&quot; task force, which had now emerged from the rain squall, and reported the carrier&#x27;s position. The second Japanese aircraft strike wave, believing &quot;Hornet&quot; to be sinking, directed their attacks on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; task force, beginning at 10:08. Again, the U.S. CAP had trouble intercepting the Japanese aircraft before they attacked &quot;Enterprise&quot;, shooting down only 2 of the 19 dive bombers as they began their dives on the carrier. Attacking through the intense anti-aircraft fire put up by &quot;Enterprise&quot; and her escorting warships, Seki&#x27;s division attacked first and scored no hits. Next attacked the division led by Lieutenant Keiichi Arima that scored hits on the carrier with two 250 kg semi-AP &quot;ordinary&quot; bombs, where the first one was released by Arima&#x27;s pilot, Petty Officer Kiyoto Furuta. The 2 bombs killed 44 men and wounded 75, and caused heavy damage to the carrier, including jamming her forward elevator in the &quot;up&quot; position. In addition, Arima&#x27;s division also achieved a near-miss with another bomb. However, ten of the nineteen Japanese bombers were lost in this attack, including Seki&#x27;s, with two more ditching on their return.

Twenty minutes later, the 16 &quot;Zuikaku&quot; torpedo planes arrived and split up to attack &quot;Enterprise&quot;. One group of torpedo bombers was attacked by two CAP Wildcats, again including Vejtasa, which shot down three of them and damaged a fourth. On fire, the fourth damaged aircraft purposely crashed into the destroyer , setting the ship on fire and killing 57 of her crew. The torpedo carried by this aircraft detonated shortly after impact, causing more damage. The fires initially seemed out of control until &quot;Smith&quot;″s commanding officer ordered the destroyer to steer into the large spraying wake of the battleship , which helped put out the fires. &quot;Smith&quot; then resumed her station, firing her remaining anti-aircraft guns at the torpedo planes.

The remaining torpedo planes attacked &quot;Enterprise&quot;, &quot;South Dakota&quot;, and the cruiser , but all of their torpedoes missed or failed, causing no damage. The engagement was over at 10:53; 9 of the 16 torpedo aircraft were lost in this attack. After suppressing most of the onboard fires, at 11:15 &quot;Enterprise&quot; reopened her flight deck to begin landing returning aircraft from the morning U.S. strikes on the Japanese warship forces. However, only a few aircraft landed before the next wave of Japanese strike aircraft arrived and began their attacks on &quot;Enterprise&quot;, forcing a suspension of landing operations.

Between 09:05 and 09:14, &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; had arrived within of the U.S. carriers and launched a strike of 17 dive bombers and 12 Zeros, under the command of Lieutenant Yoshio Shiga. As the Japanese main body and advanced force maneuvered to try to join formations, &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; readied follow-up strikes. At 11:21, the &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; aircraft arrived and dove on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; task force. The dive bombers scored one near miss on &quot;Enterprise&quot;, causing more damage, and one hit each on &quot;South Dakota&quot; and light cruiser , causing moderate damage to both ships. On &quot;South Dakota&quot;, the bomb hit the number one turret though it failed to penetrate, but two men were killed and over fifty including the ship&#x27;s commanding officer were wounded by fragments. Splinters from the bomb damaged the center and left gun of the number two turret, of which the gun crew was eventually informed by the Bureau of Ordnance that the gouges were deep enough that the barrels should not be fired; this was not fully repaired so it would handicap &quot;South Dakota&quot; in the later Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. Eight of the seventeen Japanese dive bombers were destroyed in this attack, with three more ditching on their return.

At 11:35, with &quot;Hornet&quot; out of action, &quot;Enterprise&quot; heavily damaged, and the Japanese assumed to have one or two undamaged carriers in the area, Kinkaid decided to withdraw &quot;Enterprise&quot; and her screening ships from the battle. Leaving &quot;Hornet&quot; behind, Kinkaid directed the carrier and her task force to retreat as soon as they were able. Between 11:39 and 13:22, &quot;Enterprise&quot; recovered 57 of the 73 airborne U.S. aircraft as she retreated. The remaining U.S. aircraft ditched in the ocean, and their aircrews were rescued by escorting warships.

Between 11:40 and 14:00, the two undamaged Japanese carriers, &quot;Zuikaku&quot; and &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot;, recovered the few aircraft that returned from the morning strikes on &quot;Hornet&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; and prepared follow-up strikes. It was now that the devastating losses sustained during these attacks became apparent. Lt. Cmdr. Masatake Okumiya, &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot;″s air staff officer, described the return of the carrier&#x27;s first strike groups:

 Only one of &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot;″s bomber leaders returned from the first strike, and upon landing he appeared &quot;so shaken that at times he could not speak coherently&quot;.

At 13:00, Kondo&#x27;s Advanced force and Abe&#x27;s Vanguard force warships together headed directly towards the last reported position of the U.S. carrier task forces and increased speed to try to intercept them for a gun battle. The damaged carriers &quot;Zuihō&quot; and &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, with Nagumo still on board, retreated from the battle area, leaving Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta in charge of the &quot;Zuikaku&quot; and &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; aircraft forces. At 13:06, &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; launched her second strike of seven torpedo planes led by Lieutenant Yoshiaki Irikiin, which were escorted by eight Zeros led by Lieutenant Shirane. At the same time, &quot;Zuikaku&quot; launched her third strike of seven torpedo planes, two dive bombers, and five Zeros, under the command of Lieutenant (jg) Ichirō Tanaka. Most of the torpedo planes were armed with an 800 kg armor-piercing bomb. At 15:35, &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; launched the last Japanese strike force of the day, consisting of four dive bombers and six Zeros, again under the command of Lieutenant Shiga.
After several technical problems, &quot;Northampton&quot; finally began slowly towing &quot;Hornet&quot; out of the battle area at 14:45, at a speed of only five knots. &quot;Hornet&quot;″s crew was on the verge of restoring partial power, but at 15:20, &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot;″s second strike arrived, and the seven torpedo planes attacked the almost stationary carrier. Although six of the torpedo planes missed, at 15:23, one torpedo struck &quot;Hornet&quot; amidships, which proved to be the fatal blow. The torpedo hit destroyed the repairs to the power system and caused heavy flooding and a 14-degree list. With no power to pump out the water, &quot;Hornet&quot; was given up for lost, and the remaining crew abandoned ship. The third strike from &quot;Zuikaku&quot; attacked &quot;Hornet&quot; during this time, where B5N level bombers hit the sinking ship with one 800 kg bomb. All of &quot;Hornet&quot;″s crewmen were off by 16:27. During the last Japanese attack of the day, a dive bomber from &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot;″s third strike dropped one more 250 kg semi-AP bomb on the sinking carrier at 17:20.

After being informed that Japanese forces were approaching and that further towing efforts were infeasible, Halsey ordered &quot;Hornet&quot; sunk. While the rest of the U.S. warships retired towards the southeast to get out of range of Kondō&#x27;s and Abe&#x27;s oncoming fleet, the destroyers and attempted to scuttle &quot;Hornet&quot; with multiple torpedoes and over 400 shells, but she still remained afloat. With advancing Japanese naval forces only 20 minutes away, the two U.S. destroyers abandoned &quot;Hornet&quot;″s burning hulk at 20:40. By 22:20, the rest of Kondō&#x27;s and Abe&#x27;s warships had arrived at &quot;Hornet&quot;″s location. The destroyers and then finished &quot;Hornet&quot; with four torpedoes. At 01:35 on 27 October 1942, she finally sank, at approximately . Several night attacks by radar-equipped Catalinas on &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; and &quot;Teruzuki&quot;, knowledge of the head start the U.S. warships had in their retreat from the area, plus a critical fuel situation apparently caused the Japanese to reconsider further pursuit of the U.S. warships. After refueling near the northern Solomon Islands, the Japanese ships returned to their main base at Truk on 30 October. During the U.S. withdrawal from the battle area towards Espiritu Santo and New Caledonia, while taking evasive action from a Japanese submarine, &quot;South Dakota&quot; collided with the destroyer , heavily damaging &quot;Mahan&quot;.

==Aftermath==
Both sides claimed victory. The Americans stated that two &quot;Shōkaku&quot;-class fleet carriers had been hit with bombs and eliminated. Kinkaid&#x27;s summary of damage to the Japanese included hits to a battleship, three heavy cruisers, and a light cruiser, and possible hits on another heavy cruiser. In reality, &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, &quot;Zuihō&quot;, and &quot;Chikuma&quot; were the only ships hit during the battle, none of which sank. For their part, the Japanese asserted that they sank three American carriers, one battleship, one cruiser, one destroyer, and one &quot;unidentified large warship&quot;. Actual American losses comprised the carrier &quot;Hornet&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Porter&quot;, and damage to &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the light cruiser &quot;San Juan&quot;, the destroyer &quot;Smith&quot; and the battleship &quot;South Dakota&quot;.

The loss of &quot;Hornet&quot; was a severe blow for Allied forces in the South Pacific, leaving &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; as the only operational Allied carriers in the entire Pacific theater. As &quot;Enterprise&quot; retreated from the battle, the crew posted a sign on the flight deck: &quot;Enterprise vs Japan&quot;. &quot;Enterprise&quot; received temporary repairs at New Caledonia and, although not fully restored, returned to the southern Solomons area just two weeks later to support Allied forces during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. There she played an important role in what turned out to be the decisive naval engagement in the overall campaign for Guadalcanal when her aircraft sank several Japanese warships and troop transports during the naval skirmishes around Henderson Field. The lack of carriers pressed the Americans and Japanese to deploy battleships in night operations around Guadalcanal, one of only two actions in the entire Pacific War in which battleships fought each other, with &quot;South Dakota&quot; again being damaged while two Japanese battleships were lost.

Although the Battle of Santa Cruz was a tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk, it came at a high cost for their naval forces, as &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; was the only active aircraft carrier left to challenge &quot;Enterprise&quot; or Henderson Field for the remainder of the Guadalcanal campaign. &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, despite being undamaged and having recovered the aircraft from the two damaged carriers, returned to home islands via Truk for training and aircraft ferrying duties, returning to the South Pacific only in February 1943 to cover the evacuation of Japanese ground forces from Guadalcanal. Both damaged carriers were forced to return to Japan for extensive repairs and refitting. After repair, &quot;Zuihō&quot; returned to Truk in late January 1943. &quot;Shōkaku&quot; was under repair until March 1943 and did not return to the front until July 1943, when she was reunited with &quot;Zuikaku&quot; at Truk.

The most significant losses for the Japanese Navy were in aircrew. The U.S. lost 81 of the 175 aircraft that were available at the start of the battle; of these, 33 were fighters, 28 were dive-bombers, and 20 were torpedo bombers. However, only 26 pilots and aircrew members were lost. The Japanese fared much worse, especially in airmen; in addition to losing 99 aircraft of the 203 involved in the battle, including 27 fighters, 40 dive bombers, and 29 torpedo bombers, they lost 148 pilots and aircrew members, including two dive bomber group leaders, three torpedo squadron leaders, and eighteen other section or flight leaders. The most notable casualties were the commanders of the first two strikes – Murata and Seki. Forty-nine percent of the Japanese torpedo bomber aircrews involved in the battle were killed, along with 39% of the dive bomber crews and 20% of the fighter pilots. The Japanese lost more aircrew at Santa Cruz than they had lost in each of the three previous carrier battles at Coral Sea (90), Midway (110), and Eastern Solomons (61). After these four major carrier battles, at least 409 of the 765 elite Japanese carrier aviators who had participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor were dead. Having lost so many of its veteran carrier aircrew, and with no quick way to replace them—because of an institutionalized limited capacity in its naval aircrew training programs and an absence of trained reserves—the undamaged &quot;Zuikaku&quot; was also ordered to return to Japan. &quot;Jun&#x27;yo&quot; remained and provided air support during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, &quot;Zuikaku&quot; returned just in time to cover the withdrawal of the forces from Guadalcanal.

Admiral Nagumo was relieved of command shortly after the battle and reassigned to shore duty in Japan. He acknowledged that the victory was incomplete:
 In retrospect, despite being a tactical victory, the battle effectively ended any hope the Japanese Navy might have had of scoring a decisive victory before the industrial might of the United States placed that goal out of reach. Historian Eric Hammel summed up the significance of the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands as, &quot;Santa Cruz was a Japanese victory. That victory cost Japan her last best hope to win the war.&quot;
Military historian Dr. John Prados offers a dissenting view, asserting that this was not a Pyrrhic victory for Japan, but a strategic victory: In Prados&#x27; view, the real story of the aftermath is that the Imperial Navy failed to exploit their hard-won victory.

<text>== Richard Butler ==

Richard Butler, who led the UN inspection teams in Iraq until 1998, accused the United States of promoting &quot;shocking double standards&quot; in considering unilateral military action against Iraq. He said, &quot;The spectacle of the United States, armed with its weapons of mass destruction, acting without Security Council authority to invade a country in the heartland of Arabia and, if necessary, use its weapons of mass destruction to win that battle, is something that will so deeply violate any notion of fairness in this world that I strongly suspect it could set loose forces that we would deeply live to regret.&quot; In pointing out that the United States has not responded in the same way to Syria, which is also suspected of having weapons of mass destruction, and that several US allies, including Pakistan, India, and Israel, have such weapons without having signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, Butler asked why the United States is &quot;permitting the persistence of such shocking double standards&quot;. However, part of the U.S.&#x27;s position is that Iraq is a unique case. Iraq is the only country out of this list that has had 12 years of defiance against 17 U.N. resolutions calling for its disarmament. Butler himself, upon leaving Iraq for the last time in 1998 said he could not say that Iraq had disarmed. Nor could he confirm that Iraq possessed WMDs.

==Pope John Paul II==

In 2003, the Vatican of Pope John Paul II tried to prevent the US-led invasion of Iraq, instead urging a peaceful solution. In his 2003 State of the World address, the Pope declared his opposition to the invasion by stating, &quot;No to war! War is not always inevitable. It is always a defeat for humanity.&quot; He sent former Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to the United States Pío Cardinal Laghi to talk with American President George W. Bush to express opposition to the war. John Paul II said that it was up to the United Nations to solve the international conflict through diplomacy and that a unilateral aggression is a crime against peace and a violation of international law. 

This is consistent with his previous proclamations about peace. For example, in 1999, in preparation for the 33rd World Day of Peace, he sent out a message saying:

== Nelson Mandela ==

In February, 2003, Nelson Mandela, former president of South Africa, sharply criticized Bush and his drive for war, saying, &quot;If there is a country that has committed unspeakable atrocities in the world, it is the United States of America.&quot; Mandela also said, &quot;One power with a president who has no foresight – who cannot think properly – is now wanting to plunge the world into a holocaust.&quot; Mandela also accused Bush of &quot;ignoring the U.N.&quot;. Mandela went on by asking &quot;Is this because the secretary general of the United Nations is now a black man?&quot; Mandela and Sir Richard Branson planned, with Kofi Annan&#x27;s blessing, a secret trip to Iraq to convince Saddam to step down, but the bombing starting just before they were to leave. Bush&#x27;s supporters argue that he had been working through the U.N. on this issue since the previous September; however, he and his Cabinet made it clear that they would act with or without UN agreement.

== Scott Ritter ==
As of August 2002, former UNSCOM weapons inspector Scott Ritter, who believes U.N. inspections effectively verified the destruction of over 90% of Iraq&#x27;s weapon capabilities, is actively campaigning against an invasion, and challenging the Bush administration to make public any evidence that Iraq has rebuilt the capabilities which were destroyed under the auspices of UNSCOM. Says Ritter, &quot;If Iraq was producing weapons today, we would have definitive proof.&quot; However, critics of Ritter point out that four years earlier he had exactly the opposite view as inspectors were forced to leave Iraq. In 1998, upon leaving Iraq, Ritter sharply criticized the Clinton administration and the U.N. Security Council for not being vigorous enough about insisting that Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction be destroyed. Ritter also accused U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan of assisting Iraqi efforts at impeding UNSCOM&#x27;s work. &quot;Iraq is not disarming,&quot; Ritter said on August 27, 1998, and in a second statement, &quot;Iraq retains the capability to launch a chemical strike.&quot;

== Mary Robinson ==
Former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and ex-president of Ireland Mary Robinson was also highly critical, in an article published in The Irish Times.

== Lech Wałęsa ==
Leader of the opposition to the communist regime in Poland during the 1980s, former president of Poland and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Lech Wałęsa supports the invasion and said that the UN should accept the war because it has done nothing worthy of its name in the last few years.

== Václav Havel ==
The most well known and highly regarded dissident in Communist Czechoslovakia and later President of democratic Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic, Václav Havel spoke in favour of a projected American and Allied invasion of Iraq as early as September 2002, stating that &quot;Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime poses a major threat to many nations and to his own people ... there should be an international intervention.&quot;

== Adam Michnik ==
Adam Michnik, the most important intellectual of the Polish Solidarity movement, also issued statements in support of the war, pointing to historical reasons for the former eastern bloc countries&#x27; support for the American action in Iraq.

== Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton ==
Former American Presidents Carter and Clinton have both offered criticism on the war. While Clinton was in favor of regime change, and supported the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, he strongly objected to the ways in which he perceived the Bush administration to be ignoring the will of the America&#x27;s traditional allies and undermining proper UN procedures. President Carter opposed the war entirely, and the Carter Center outlined a specific &quot;alternative to war&quot; plan that involved an increased presence of weapons inspectors.

<doc id="514932" wikidata="Q1079418" url="?curid=514932" title="Cursive">
<text>Cursive (also known as joined-up writing) is any style of penmanship in which characters are written joined in a flowing manner, generally for the purpose of making writing faster, in contrast to block letters. It varies in functionality and modern-day usage across languages and regions; being used both publicly in artistic and formal documents as well as in private communication. Formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. The writing style can be further divided as &quot;looped&quot;, &quot;italic&quot;, or &quot;connected&quot;.

The cursive method is used with many alphabets due to infrequent pen lifting and beliefs that it increases writing speed. Despite this belief, more elaborate or ornamental styles of writing can be slower to reproduce. In some alphabets, many or all letters in a word are connected, sometimes making a word one single complex stroke.

== History ==
Cursive is a style of penmanship in which the symbols of the language are written in a , or flowing, manner, generally for the purpose of making writing faster. This writing style is distinct from &quot;print-script&quot; using block letters, in which the letters of a word are unconnected. Not all cursive copybooks join all letters; formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. In the Arabic, Syriac, Latin, and Cyrillic scripts, many or all letters in a word are connected (while others must not), sometimes making a word one single complex stroke. In Hebrew cursive and Roman cursive, the letters are not connected. In Maharashtra, there was a cursive alphabet, known as the &#x27;Modi&#x27; script, used to write the Marathi language.

=== Subclasses ===
==== Ligature ====
Ligature is writing the letters of words with lines connecting the letters so that one does not have to pick up the pen or pencil between letters. Commonly some of the letters are written in a looped manner to facilitate the connections. In common printed Greek texts, the modern small letter fonts are called &quot;cursive&quot; (as opposed to uncial) though the letters do not connect.

==== Looped ====
In &quot;looped cursive&quot; penmanship, some ascenders and descenders have loops which allows for the letters to link. This is generally what people refer to when they say &quot;cursive&quot; in the context of English. The letters in this style have their own unique characteristics. For example the lowercase &quot;t&quot; is taller, while the lowercase &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot; are rounder compared to other styles like Italic cursives, where the letters are easy to read and they have this curl like sans serif features. Also, the lowercase &quot;x&quot; links out at the baseline.

==== Italic ====
&quot;Cursive italic&quot; penmanship—derived from chancery cursive—uses non-looped joins, and not all letters are joined. In italic cursive, there are no joins from g, j, q, or y, and a few other joins are discouraged. Italic penmanship became popular in the 15th-century Italian Renaissance. The term &quot;italic&quot; as it relates to handwriting is not to be confused with italic typed letters. Many, but not all, letters in the handwriting of the Renaissance were joined, as most are today in cursive italic.

== Family ==
The origins of the cursive method are associated with the practical advantages of writing speed and infrequent pen-lifting to accommodate the limitations of the quill. Quills are fragile, easily broken, and will spatter unless used properly. They also run out of ink faster than most contemporary writing utensils. Steel dip pens followed quills; they were sturdier, but still had some limitations. The individuality of the provenance of a document (see Signature) was a factor also, as opposed to machine font. Cursive was also favoured because the writing tool was rarely taken off the paper.
The term &quot;cursive&quot; derives from Middle French from Medieval Latin , which literally means &#x27;running&#x27;. This term in turn derives from Latin (&#x27;to run, hasten&#x27;). Although by the 2010s, the use of cursive appeared to be on the decline, it seemed to be coming back into use.

==Bengali==
In the Bengali cursive script
(also known in Bengali as &quot;professional writing&quot;) the letters are more likely to be more curvy in appearance than in standard Bengali handwriting. Also, the horizontal supporting bar on each letter (&quot;matra&quot;) runs continuously through the entire word, unlike in standard handwriting. This cursive handwriting often used by literature experts differs in appearance from the standard Bengali alphabet as it is free hand writing, where sometimes the alphabets are complex and appear different from the standard handwriting.

== Chinese ==
Cursive forms of Chinese characters are used in calligraphy; &quot;running script&quot; is the semi-cursive form and &quot;rough script&quot; (mistakenly called &quot;grass script&quot; due to literal misinterpretation) is the cursive. The running aspect of this script has more to do with the formation and connectedness of strokes &quot;within&quot; an individual character than with connections between characters as in Western connected cursive. The latter are rare in hanzi and in the derived Japanese kanji characters which are usually well separated by the writer.

== English ==

Cursive writing was used in English before the Norman conquest. Anglo-Saxon charters typically include a boundary clause written in Old English in a cursive script. A cursive handwriting style—secretary hand—was widely used for both personal correspondence and official documents in England from early in the 16th century.

Cursive handwriting developed into something approximating its current form from the 17th century, but its use was neither uniform, nor standardized either in England itself or elsewhere in the British Empire. In the English colonies of the early 17th century, most of the letters are clearly separated in the handwriting of William Bradford, though a few were joined as in a cursive hand. In England itself, Edward Cocker had begun to introduce a version of the French &quot;ronde&quot; style, which was then further developed and popularized throughout the British Empire in the 17th and 18th centuries as round hand by John Ayers and William Banson.

=== Cursive writing in the United Kingdom ===
Today there is no standardised teaching script stipulated in the various national curriculums for schools in the United Kingdom, only that one font style needs to be used consistently throughout the school. In both the cursive and the continuous cursive writing styles, letters are created through joining lines and curve shapes in a particular way. Once pupils have learnt how to clearly form single letters, they are taught how single letters can be joined to form a flowing script. 

Characteristics of cursive and continuous cursive scripts:
Whether cursive or continuous cursive is to be favoured remains a subject of debate. While many schools in the United Kingdom are opting to teach continuous cursive throughout the year groups, often starting in Reception, critics have argued that conjoined writing styles leave many children struggling with the high level of gross and fine motor coordination required.

=== Cursive writing in North America ===
==== Development in the 18th and 19th centuries ==== 
In the American colonies, on the eve of their independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, it is notable that Thomas Jefferson joined most, but not all the letters when drafting the United States Declaration of Independence. However, a few days later, Timothy Matlack professionally re-wrote the presentation copy of the Declaration in a fully joined, cursive hand. Eighty-seven years later, in the middle of the 19th century, Abraham Lincoln drafted the Gettysburg Address in a cursive hand that would not look out of place today.

Not all such cursive, then or now, joined all of the letters within a word.

In both the British Empire and the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, before the typewriter, professionals used cursive for their correspondence. This was called a &quot;fair hand&quot;, meaning it looked good, and firms trained all their clerks to write in exactly the same script.

Although women&#x27;s handwriting had noticeably different particulars from men&#x27;s, the general forms were not prone to rapid change. In the mid-19th century, most children were taught the contemporary cursive; in the United States, this usually occurred in second or third grade (around ages seven to nine). Few simplifications appeared as the middle of the 20th century approached.

After the 1960s, a movement originally begun by Paul Standard in the 1930s to replace looped cursive with cursive italic penmanship resurfaced. It was motivated by the claim that cursive instruction was more difficult than it needed to be; that conventional (looped) cursive was unnecessary, and it was easier to write in cursive italic. Because of this, various new forms of cursive italic appeared, including Getty-Dubay Italic, and Barchowsky Fluent Handwriting. In the 21st century, some of the surviving cursive writing styles are Spencerian, Palmer Method, D&#x27;Nealian, and Zaner-Bloser script.

==== Decline of English cursive in the United States ====

One of the earliest forms of new technology that caused the decline of handwriting was the invention of the ballpoint pen, patented in 1888 by John Loud. Two brothers, László and György Bíró, further developed the ballpoint pen by changing the design and using different ink that dried quickly. Unlike older pen designs, this new invention guaranteed that the ink would not smudge and did not require such careful penmanship. After World War II, the ballpoint pen was mass-produced and sold cheaply, changing how people wrote. Over time, the emphasis on using cursive declined slowly, and was later impacted by other technologies such as the phone, computer, and keyboard.

Cursive has been in decline throughout the 21st century because it is no longer perceived as necessary. The Fairfax Education Association, the largest teachers&#x27; union in Fairfax County, Virginia, has called cursive a &quot;dying art&quot;.

On the 2006 SAT, an American university matriculation exam, only 15 percent of the students wrote their essay answers in cursive. However, students might be discouraged from using cursive on standardized tests because they will receive lower marks if their answers are hard to read, and some graders may have difficulties reading cursive. Nevertheless, in 2007, a survey of 200 teachers of first through third grades in all 50 American states, 90 percent of respondents said their schools required the teaching of cursive, but a nationwide survey in 2008 found elementary school teachers lacking formal training in teaching handwriting; only 12 percent reported having taken a course in how to teach it.

In 2012, the American states of Indiana and Hawaii announced that their schools would no longer be required to teach cursive (but will still be permitted to), and instead will be required to teach &quot;keyboard proficiency&quot;. Nationwide Common Core State Standards (which do not include instruction in cursive) were proposed in 2009 and had been adopted by 44 states as of July 2011—all of which have debated whether to augment them with cursive.

==== Conservation efforts and effects on the learning disabled ====
Many historical documents, such as the United States Constitution, are written in cursive—some argue the inability to read cursive therefore precludes one from being able to fully appreciate such documents in their original format. Despite the decline in the day-to-day use of cursive, it is being reintroduced to the curriculum of some schools in the United States. California passed cursive handwriting legislation in 2023, adding to a wave of state legislation between 2013 and 2023 that requires the incorporation of cursive handwriting into elementary education. Other states such as Idaho, Kansas, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Jersey, and Tennessee had already mandated cursive in schools as a part of the Back to Basics program designed to maintain the integrity of cursive handwriting. Cursive instruction is required by grade 5 in Illinois, starting with the 2018–2019 school year. Some argue that cursive is not worth teaching in schools and &quot;in the 1960s cursive was implemented because of preference and not an educational basis; Hawaii and Indiana have replaced cursive instruction with &#x27;keyboard proficiency&#x27; and 44 other states are currently weighing similar measures.&quot;

Maria Montessori argued that writing with straight lines is more difficult than writing with curved lines and children would benefit from learning cursive first.

Students with dyslexia, who have difficulty learning to read because their brains have difficulty associating sounds and letter combinations efficiently, have found that cursive can help them with the decoding process because it integrates hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills, and other brain and memory functions. However, students with dysgraphia may be badly served, or even substantially hindered, by demands for cursive.

== German ==
Up to the 19th century, (also known as &quot;German cursive&quot;) was used in German-language longhand. Kurrent was not used exclusively, but rather in parallel to modern cursive (which is the same as English cursive). Writers used both cursive styles: location, contents and context of the text determined which style to use. A successor of , , was widely used in the period 1911–1941 until the Nazi Party banned it and its printed equivalent . German speakers brought up with continued to use it well into the post-war period.

Today, three different styles of cursive writing are taught in German schools, the (introduced in 1953), the (1968), and the (1969). The German National Primary Schoolteachers&#x27; Union has proposed replacing all three with , a simplified form of non-cursive handwriting adopted by Hamburg schools.

== Greek ==

The Greek alphabet has had several cursive forms in the course of its development. In antiquity, a cursive form of handwriting was used in writing on papyrus. It employed slanted and partly connected letter forms as well as many ligatures. Some features of this handwriting were later adopted into Greek minuscule, the dominant form of handwriting in the medieval and early modern era. In the 19th and 20th centuries, an entirely new form of cursive Greek, more similar to contemporary Western European cursive scripts, was developed.

== Marathi ==

Modi is a cursive script used to write Marathi that is thought to be derived from the Devanagari script. It was used alongside Devanagari until the 20th century as a shorthand script for quick writing in business and administration. Due to the promotion of the Balbodh variant of Devanagari as the standard writing system for Marathi, Modi largely fell out of use by the mid-20th century. Since then there have been attempts to revive this script.

A distinctive feature of this script is that the head stroke is written before the letters, in order to produce a &quot;ruled page&quot; for writing in lines. It has several characteristics that facilitate writing so that moving from one character to the next minimises lifting the pen from the paper for dipping in ink. Some characters are &quot;broken&quot; versions of their Devanagari counterparts. Many characters are more circular in shape. The long &#x27;ī&#x27; (ई) and short &#x27;u&#x27; (उ) are used in place of the short &#x27;i&#x27; (इ) and long &#x27;ū&#x27; (ऊ) respectively.

== Roman ==

&quot;Roman cursive&quot; is a form of handwriting (or a script) used in ancient Rome and to some extent into the Middle Ages. It is customarily divided into old (or ancient) cursive, and new cursive. Old Roman cursive, also called majuscule cursive and capitalis cursive, was the everyday form of handwriting used for writing letters, by merchants writing business accounts, by schoolchildren learning the Latin alphabet, and even by emperors issuing commands. New Roman, also called minuscule cursive or later cursive, developed from old cursive. It was used from approximately the 3rd century to the 7th century, and uses letter forms that are more recognizable to modern eyes; &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, and &quot;e&quot; have taken a more familiar shape, and the other letters are proportionate to each other rather than varying wildly in size and placement on a line.
== Russian ==

The &quot;Russian Cursive Cyrillic&quot; alphabet is used (instead of the block letters) when handwriting the modern Russian language. While several letters resemble Latin counterparts, many of them represent different sounds. Most handwritten Russian, especially personal letters and schoolwork, uses the cursive Russian (Cyrillic) alphabet although use of block letters in private writing has been rising. Most children in Russian schools are taught in the first grade how to write using this Russian script.

<text>Paul Edward Begala (born May 12, 1961) is an American political consultant and political commentator, best known as the former advisor to President Bill Clinton.

Begala was a chief strategist for the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign, which carried 33 states and made Clinton the first Democrat to occupy the White House in 12 years. As counselor to the President in the Clinton White House, he coordinated policy, politics, and communications.

Begala gained national prominence as part of the political consulting team Carville and Begala, which he formed with fellow Clinton advisor James Carville. He was a co-host on the political debate program &quot;Equal Time&quot; on MSNBC from 1999 to 2000, and a co-host on the similar debate program &quot;Crossfire&quot; on CNN from 2002 to 2005. He now appears regularly on CNN as a Democratic pundit. He is an Affiliated Professor of Public Policy at Georgetown University&#x27;s McCourt School of Public Policy.

== Early life and education ==
Begala was born in New Jersey, to an Irish American mother, Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; (née Cass), and a Hungarian American father, David Begala. He was raised in Missouri City, Texas, where his father was an oil-field equipment salesman. In 1979, Begala graduated from Dulles High School in Sugar Land, Texas.

He earned both his Bachelor of Arts and Juris Doctor from the University of Texas at Austin, where he taught briefly. While at the University of Texas, Begala was a candidate for student government president. However, he finished second to a write-in campaign for Hank the Hallucination, a character from the campus comic strip &quot;Eyebeam&quot;. Following his loss, Begala wrote a tongue-in-cheek complaint for the &quot;Daily Texan&quot;, arguing &quot;I cannot help but feel Hank&#x27;s platform is illusory at best...I must say that the candidate himself lacks substance&quot;. Begala was declared the winner, following a ruling that imaginary characters could not hold the position.

== Career ==
Begala, along with business partner James Carville, helped then-Governor of Arkansas Clinton win the 1992 presidential election. Begala was a chief strategist for the 1992 Clinton–Gore campaign. Clinton carried 33 states and became the first Democrat elected president since 1976. Begala later served as a counselor to the President in the Clinton White House, where he coordinated policy, politics, and communications.

Aside from the 1992 presidential election, Begala and Carville had other well-known political victories including the 1991 Pennsylvania U.S. Senate victory of Harris Wofford, the 1988 re-election campaign of incumbent New Jersey U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg, and the gubernatorial victories of Robert Casey in Pennsylvania in 1986, Wallace G. Wilkinson in Kentucky in 1987, and Zell Miller in Georgia in 1990. Begala later revealed he had favored his former client, Pennsylvania senator Harris Wofford, over Al Gore as Bill Clinton&#x27;s running mate in the 1992 presidential election.

He was a contributor to John F. Kennedy, Jr.&#x27;s political magazine &quot;George&quot; in the late 1990s.

From 1999 until its cancellation in 2000, Begala co-hosted the political debate show &quot;Equal Time&quot; with Oliver North on MSNBC. From 2002 until its cancellation in 2005, he co-hosted the political debate show &quot;Crossfire&quot; on CNN, alternating with Carville as the left-wing host, while the position of right-wing host alternated between Robert Novak and Tucker Carlson.

As an author and co-author, Begala has written five political books: &quot;Is Our Children Learning?: The Case Against George W. Bush&quot;; &quot;Buck Up, Suck Up and Come Back When You Foul Up&quot; (with James Carville); &quot;It&#x27;s Still the Economy Stupid&quot;; and &quot;Third Term: Why George W. Bush (Hearts) John McCain&quot;.

He was an early supporter of Hillary Clinton during the 2008 presidential primaries. However, after she dropped out of the race, he became a backer of Barack Obama.

On January 12, 2008, Begala appeared on NPR&#x27;s radio show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;, playing the game Not My Job. He won by answering two out of three questions correctly.

Begala was a consultant in the service of mortgage lender Freddie Mac, an arrangement that ended in September 2008.

Begala is currently a CNN political commentator and a research professor of public policy at Georgetown University&#x27;s McCourt School of Public Policy.

He is a member of the board of directors of Democratic Majority for Israel, an organization that promotes U.S.-Israel cooperation and whose political arm, DMFI PAC, ran attack ads against Senator Bernie Sanders&#x27;s candidacy before the 2020 presidential election.

Looking back at his career and the U.S. political scene, Begala has remarked that a &quot;presidential campaign is like a film. It never comes together until it&#x27;s scored and tracked&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Begala and his wife, Diane Friday, have four sons. They currently live in Virginia.

Begala is Roman Catholic.

<doc id="514937" wikidata="Q3881242" url="?curid=514937" title="Turtles all the way down">
<text>&quot;Turtles all the way down&quot; is an expression of the problem of infinite regress. The saying alludes to the mythological idea of a World Turtle that supports a flat Earth on its back. It suggests that this turtle rests on the back of an even larger turtle, which itself is part of a column of increasingly larger turtles that continues indefinitely.

The exact origin of the phrase is uncertain. In the form &quot;rocks all the way down&quot;, the saying appears as early as 1838. References to the saying&#x27;s mythological antecedents, the World Turtle and its counterpart the World Elephant, were made by a number of authors in the 17th and 18th centuries.

The expression has been used to illustrate problems such as the regress argument in epistemology.

==History==
===Background in Hindu mythology===
Early variants of the saying do not always have explicit references to infinite regression (i.e., the phrase &quot;all the way down&quot;). They often reference stories featuring a World Elephant, World Turtle, or other similar creatures that are claimed to come from Hindu mythology. The first known reference to a Hindu source is found in a letter by Jesuit Emanuel da Veiga (1549–1605), written at Chandagiri on 18 September 1599, in which the relevant passage reads:
Veiga&#x27;s account seems to have been received by Samuel Purchas, who has a close paraphrase in his &quot;Purchas His Pilgrims&quot; (1613/1626), 
&quot;that the Earth had nine corners, whereby it was borne up by the Heaven. Others dissented, and said, that the Earth was borne up by seven Elephants; the Elephants&#x27; feet stood on Tortoises, and they were borne by they know not what.&quot; Purchas&#x27; account is again reflected by John Locke in his 1689 tract &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;, where Locke introduces the story as a trope referring to the problem of induction in philosophical debate. Locke compares one who would say that properties inhere in &quot;Substance&quot; to the Indian who said the world was on an elephant which was on a tortoise, &quot;But being again pressed to know what gave support to the broad-back&#x27;d Tortoise, replied, something, he knew not what&quot;. The story is also referenced by Henry David Thoreau, who writes in his journal entry of 4 May 1852: &quot;Men are making speeches ... all over the country, but each expresses only the thought, or the want of thought, of the multitude. No man stands on truth. They are merely banded together as usual, one leaning on another and all together on nothing; as the Hindoos made the world rest on an elephant, and the elephant on a tortoise, and had nothing to put under the tortoise.&quot;

===Modern form===
In the form of &quot;rocks all the way down&quot;, the saying dates to at least 1838, when it was printed in an unsigned anecdote in the &quot;New-York Mirror&quot; about a schoolboy and an old woman living in the woods:

Another version of the saying appeared in an 1854 transcript of remarks by preacher Joseph Frederick Berg addressed to Joseph Barker:

Many 20th-century attributions claim that philosopher and psychologist William James is the source of the phrase. James referred to the fable of the elephant and tortoise several times, but told the infinite regress story with &quot;rocks all the way down&quot; in his 1882 essay, &quot;Rationality, Activity and Faith&quot;:

The linguist John R. Ross also associates James with the phrase:

== Turtle world, infinite regress and explanatory failure ==
The mythological idea of a &quot;turtle world&quot; is often used as an illustration of infinite regresses. An &quot;infinite regress&quot; is an infinite series of entities governed by a recursive principle that determines how each entity in the series depends on or is produced by its predecessor. The main interest in &quot;infinite regresses&quot; is due to their role in &quot;infinite regress arguments&quot;. An &quot;infinite regress argument&quot; is an argument against a theory based on the fact that this theory leads to an infinite regress. For such an argument to be successful, it has to demonstrate not just that the theory in question entails an infinite regress but also that this regress is vicious. There are different ways in which a regress can be vicious. The idea of a &quot;turtle world&quot; exemplifies viciousness due to &quot;explanatory failure&quot;: it does not solve the problem it was formulated to solve. Instead, it assumes already in disguised form what it was supposed to explain. This is akin to the informal fallacy of begging the question. In one interpretation, the goal of positing the existence of a world turtle is to explain why the earth seems to be at rest instead of falling down: because it rests on the back of a giant turtle. In order to explain why the turtle itself is not in free fall, another, even bigger turtle is posited, and so on, resulting in a world that is &quot;turtles all the way down&quot;. Despite its shortcomings in clashing with modern physics, and due to its ontological extravagance, this theory seems to be metaphysically possible, assuming that space is infinite, thereby avoiding an outright contradiction. But it fails because it has to assume rather than explain at each step that there is another thing that is not falling. It does not explain why nothing at all is falling.

==In epistemology and other disciplines==
The metaphor is used as an example of the problem of infinite regress in epistemology to show that there is a necessary foundation to knowledge, as written by Johann Gottlieb Fichte in 1794:

David Hume references the story in his 1779 work &quot;Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion&quot; when arguing against God as an unmoved mover:

Bertrand Russell also mentions the story in his 1927 lecture &quot;Why I Am Not a Christian&quot; while discounting the First Cause argument intended to be a proof of God&#x27;s existence:

==Modern allusions or variations==
References to &quot;turtles all the way down&quot; have been made in a variety of modern contexts. For example, American hardcore band Every Time I Die titled a song “Turtles All the Way Down” on their 2009 album “New Junk Aesthetic”. The lyrics mention the turtle world theory.

&quot;Turtles All the Way Down&quot; is the name of a song by country artist Sturgill Simpson that appears on his 2014 album &quot;Metamodern Sounds in Country Music&quot;. &quot;Gamma Goblins (&#x27;Its Turtles All The Way Down&#x27; Mix)&quot; is a remix by Ott for the 2002 Hallucinogen album &quot;In Dub&quot;. &quot;Turtles All the Way Down&quot; is also the title of a 2017 novel by John Green about a teenage girl with obsessive–compulsive disorder.

Musician Captain Beefheart used the phrase in 1975 to describe playing with Frank Zappa and the Mothers (captured on the album Bongo Fury) when he told Steve Weitzman of Rolling Stone that he &quot;had an extreme amount of fun on this tour. They move awfully fast. I&#x27;ve never travelled this fast with the Magic Band—turtles all the way down.&quot;

Stephen Hawking incorporates the saying into the beginning of his 1988 book &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;:

Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia discussed his &quot;favored version&quot; of the saying in a footnote to his 2006 plurality opinion in &quot;Rapanos v. United States&quot;:

Microsoft Visual Studio had a gamification plug-in that awarded badges for certain programming behaviors and patterns. One of the badges was &quot;Turtles All the Way Down&quot;, which was awarded for writing a class with 10 or more levels of inheritance.

In a TED-Ed video discussing Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems, the phrase &quot;Gödels all the way down&quot; is used to describe the way in which one can never get rid of unprovable true statements in an axiomatic system.

<text>Flagship Studios was an American video game developer founded by Bill Roper along with , , and David Brevik, former high level Blizzard North executives. The core personnel of Flagship Studios had been collaborating as a team since 1993 when they founded Condor Studios (later bought out and renamed Blizzard North) and in addition to creating the &quot;Diablo&quot; franchise many were key high level executives in the development of &quot;Warcraft&quot;, &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; games. Flagship Studios was formed following the resignation en masse of Blizzard North management following a dispute with Blizzard Entertainment parent company Vivendi regarding the potential fate of the company, development team, and titles, which were in doubt at that time. Flagship Studio&#x27;s primary target platform for their games was the PC.

Flagship Studios had a partnership with Namco Hometek and HanbitSoft to cover an international market for game marketing and distribution. The company dissolved in August 2008 because of financial troubles. Max Schaefer and Erich Schaefer moved on to help form Runic Games.

==Titles==
===&quot;Hellgate: London&quot;===
In March 2005, following months of teasing concept art for an unknown game, Flagship Studios&#x27; first title named &quot;&quot; was announced via an exclusive article in the computer magazine PC Gamer. It was formally released October 31, 2007 as an action role-playing game (RPG) in the same vein as the &quot;Diablo&quot; games, but with the twist of being played in 3D, primarily from a first-person perspective. The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic demon-infested London, following a great battle between demons and humans. Unlike regular first-person shooters, the game features RPG content in the form of e.g. random quests, and where a character&#x27;s combat efficiency is more determined by statistics than player reflexes. In addition, the game features random levels, uncommon in games of similar perspective and scale. Expectations from the game were high, as earlier games the developers have been involved in, especially titles from Blizzard Entertainment, have become best sellers with few exceptions. However, it received mixed reviews, and complaints by many gamers that the game was released in an unfinished state, which was later admitted by CEO Bill Roper. The company no longer owns the intellectual property rights to the game.

===&quot;Mythos&quot;===
&quot;Mythos&quot; was a game under development by a division of Flagship Studios commonly called &quot;Flagship Seattle&quot;. An online RPG, similar in style to &quot;Diablo&quot;, the game was used to test the networking technology behind the multiplayer component of &quot;Hellgate: London&quot;. It was expected to be free to play and download, although the financing model was never set in stone. Following the layoffs at Flagship Studios due to the financial issues, the intellectual property rights over Mythos have now been claimed by the Korean company Hanbitsoft, which was offered as collateral for loans earlier in the year. &quot;Mythos&quot; lead designer Travis Baldree and Flagship Studios co-founder Max Schaefer have subsequently formed the new game company Runic Games along with the remaining staff of 14 behind the game from Flagship Seattle. Runic Games developed the &quot;Diablo&quot;-like action RPG &quot;Torchlight&quot;. They have since left Runic to found Double Damage Games.

==Closed==
The co-founder Max Schaefer announced on August 15, 2008, that the studio has &quot;for all intents and purposes&quot; shut down.

<doc id="514950" wikidata="Q312378" url="?curid=514950" title="Asian long-horned beetle">
<text>The Asian long-horned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis), also known as the starry sky, sky beetle, or ALB, is native to the Korean Peninsula, northern and southern China, and disputably in northern Japan. This species has now been accidentally introduced into the eastern United States, where it was first discovered in 1996, as well as Canada, and several countries in Europe, including Austria, France, Germany, Italy and UK.

==Taxonomy and description==
Common names for &quot;Anoplophora glabripennis&quot; in Asia are the starry sky beetle, basicosta white-spotted longicorn beetle, or smooth shoulder-longicorn, and it is called the Asian long-horned beetle (ALB) in North America.

Adults are very large insects with bodies ranging from in length and antennae which can be as long as or 1.5–2 times longer than the body of the insect. They are shiny black with about 20 white spots on each wing cover and long antennae conspicuously banded black and white. These beetles can fly, but generally only for short distances, which is a common limitation for Cerambycidae of their size and weight. The upper sections of the legs of the adults are whitish-blue. &quot;A. glabripennis&quot; can be distinguished from related species by the markings on the wing covers and the pattern of the antennae.


==Range, habitat, and hosts==
The Asian long-horned beetle is native to eastern Asia, primarily in eastern China and Korea. This species was known from Japan in the mid-1800s, but may or may not be native there. It is invasive outside its native range.

In its native range, &quot;Anoplophora glabripennis&quot; primarily infests plants like maple, poplar, willow, and elm trees. In the United States, &quot;A. glabripennis&quot; has completed development on species of these genera and also &quot;Aesculus&quot;, &quot;Albizia&quot;, birch, katsura, ash, planes, and &quot;Sorbus&quot;. In Canada, complete development has been confirmed only on maple, birch, poplar, and willow, although oviposition has occurred on other tree genera. Maple is the most commonly infested tree genus in North America, followed by elm and willow. In Europe, complete development has been recorded on maple, &quot;Aesculus&quot;, alder, birch, hornbeam, beech, ash, planes, poplar, &quot;Prunus&quot;, willow, and &quot;Sorbus&quot;. The top five host genera infested in Europe, in decreasing order, are maple, birch, willow, &quot;Aesculus&quot;, and poplar. Not all poplar species are equally susceptible to attack. Other economically important trees attacked include apple (&quot;Malus domestica&quot;), mulberry (&quot;Morus alba&quot;), stone fruits (&quot;Prunus&quot; spp.), pear (&quot;Pyrus&quot; spp.), roses (&quot;Rosa&quot; spp.), and black locust (&quot;Robinia pseudoacacia&quot;).
In North America, established populations were first discovered in August 1996 in Brooklyn, New York and has since been found in other areas of New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, Ohio, and Ontario in Canada. However, it has also been eradicated from some regions within these states and provinces. The first confirmed detection in South Carolina was June 4, 2020, at a residence in Hollywood, Charleston County. As a result both Clemson University&#x27;s State Crop Pest Commission (which regulates crop pests for the state government) and the federal APHIS declared a quarantine.

In Europe, established populations have been found in Austria (in Braunau am Inn in 2001), Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, though the beetle had also been intercepted in areas through inspection of international trade goods such as wood packaging. In January 2021 Austria was declared free of them after 4 years (2 life cycles) of no detections in Gallspach, the last Austrian infestation.

==Life cycles==

Adult females lay 45–62 eggs in their lifetime by chewing a small pit through the bark of the host tree to the cambium and lay one long egg underneath the bark in each pit. Eggs hatch in 13–54 days depending on temperature. Eggs that have not developed enough, such as those laid in late summer or early fall, will overwinter and hatch the following season.

Larvae are cylindrical and elongate and can be long and wide. Larvae first create a feeding gallery in the cambial region, but more mature larvae tunnel to the heartwood as they feed. Larvae go through at least five instars over 1–2 years; which can vary due to host or temperature conditions. Larvae expel frass from their tunnels near the original oviposition site. A larva can consume up to 1,000 cubic cm of wood in its lifetime. Asian long-horned beetle larvae do not pupate before they reach a critical weight, so additional larval instars can occur.

Pupation usually occurs in spring at the end of the larval tunnel in the sapwood, eclosion occurs 12–50 days later, and adults will chew out of the tree approximately one week after eclosion. Adults feed on leaf petioles and can chew through bark on small branches to feed on the vascular cambium. Eggs, larvae or as pupae can overwinter within the tree. In their overwintering phase, pupae are inactive, and development does not occur. They resume their life cycle when temperatures are above .

Upon emergence, adult females can copulate, although an obligatory maturation period is required for feeding after emergence for ovarian maturation. Laboratory studies have estimated the female maturation period lasts 9–15 days. Adult males have mature spermatozoa before emergence, and feeding is necessary only to sustain their normal activity. Adults typically lay eggs on the plant they developed on during immature stages rather than colonizing new plants unless population density is high or the host plant is dead. However, when they do disperse, they can travel up to approximately from their host tree in a growing season in search of new hosts, although in a mark-recapture experiment about 98% of adults were recaptured within of their release point. Adults will typically infest the crown and main branches first and will begin to infest the trunk as the crown dies. Adult longevity and fecundity are influenced by conditions such as the larval host plant and temperature. Laboratory reared males and females can live up to 202 and 158 days, respectively.

==As an invasive species== 
Due to high tree mortality caused by larval feeding outside its native range, &quot;A. glabripennis&quot; can change both forest and urban ecosystems. In the United States, it can potentially destroy 30.3% of urban trees and cause $669 billion in economic loss. Early detection is used to manage infestations before they can spread.

===Monitoring===
Tree infestation can be detected by looking for exit holes 3/8 to 3/4 inches in diameter (1–2 cm) often in the larger branches of the crowns of infested trees. Sometimes sap can be seen oozing from the exit holes with coarse sawdust or &quot;frass&quot; in evidence on the ground or lower branches. Dead and dying tree limbs or branches and yellowing leaves when there has been no drought also indicate &quot;A. glabripennis&quot; infestation. Traps can also be used containing a pheromone and a plant kairomone to attract nearby adults. Some acoustic sensors can also differentiate larval feeding within trees. Dogs can also be trained to detect the smell of frass on trees.

Workers have found and reported infested material in warehouses in CA, FL, IL, IN, MA, MI, NC, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA, and WI in the United States, and in the Greater Toronto Area in Ontario, Canada. After an aggressive containment program and with the last confirmed sighting in 2007, Canada declared itself free of the beetle on April 5, 2013 and lifted restrictions on the movement of tree materials.

In September 1998, US customs regulations were changed to require wooden packing materials from China be chemically treated or kiln-dried to prevent further infestations of the Asian long-horned beetle from arriving.

===Quarantine===
Quarantines have been established around infested areas to prevent accidental spread of &quot;A. glabripennis&quot; by humans. The use of solid wood packing materials for maritime shipping is regulated for adequate treatment methods at certain ports.

===Management===
All infested trees should be removed by certified tree care personnel to ensure that the process is completed properly, and chipped in place, their stumps ground to below the soil level. Insecticides such as imidacloprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran have been used to target adult beetles in canopies or as trunk injections to target larvae. Insecticides within the tree may not translocate evenly, which allows some &quot;A. glabripennis&quot; to survive treatments. Combined with efficacy concerns, high cost, and non-target effects on other insects, widespread prophylactic treatment of trees in an infestation area concern scientists.

Over 1,550 trees in Chicago have been cut down and destroyed to eradicate &quot;A. glabripennis&quot; from Chicago. In New York, over 6,000 infested trees resulted in the removal of over 18,000 trees; New Jersey&#x27;s infestation of over 700 trees led to the removal and destruction of almost 50,000 trees, but infested trees continue to be discovered.

Some resistant trees have been developed that quickly fill oviposition pits with sap or produce callous tissue that encases and kills eggs. Non-host species are typically used to replace removed trees.

Biological control has also been considered in some areas such as China. Fungi, such as &quot;Beauveria brongniartii,&quot; can increase mortality in larvae and adults while &quot;Metarhizium brunneum&quot; and &quot;Beauveria asiatica&quot; can reduce adult survival time. Most parasitoids in the native range of &quot;A. glabripennis&quot; have a broad host range, and are not suitable as classical biological control agents. Woodpeckers can also be a significant source of mortality. Countries working towards eradicating &quot;A. glabripennis&quot; typically do not initially utilize biological control.

====Eradication====
In areas such as North America where infestations are small, &quot;A. glabripennis&quot; can potentially be eradicated. As trees are removed or treated, all host trees on public and private property located within an established distance from an infested area are surveyed by trained personnel. Infested areas are re-surveyed at least once per year for 3–5 years after the last beetle or infested tree is found.

In the US, &quot;A. glabripennis&quot; has been eradicated from Islip, Manhattan, Staten Island, Chicago and Boston. In Canada, it was declared eradicated in Toronto and Vaughan, Ontario, but it was rediscovered there in 2013. In 2019, the U.S. Department of Agriculture declared New York City free of the beetle after a 23-year eradication effort. In June 2020, Marie-Claude Bibeau (the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food) and Seamus O&#x27;Regan (the Minister of Natural Resources) declared that &quot;A. glabripennis&quot; had been eradicated in Mississauga and Toronto, the only two areas of known infestation in Canada.

In 2012, the first recorded outbreak of Asian longhorn beetle in the UK was found at Paddock Wood in Kent, near small commercial premises that had imported stone from China. Novel techniques used to control the outbreak included the use of two detection dogs trained in Austria that can smell the beetles in trees. At the end of the first year’s survey, 1,500 trees had been felled and burned from fields and roadsides and 700 from commercial premises and private gardens. The beetle was declared eradicated in 2019.
