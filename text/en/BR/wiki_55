<text>Deadman (Boston Brand) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He first appeared in &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #205 (October 1967), and was created by writer Arnold Drake and artist Carmine Infantino.

The character is depicted as an acrobat who was murdered by an unknown assailant, and then granted power by a Hindu deity to remain a disembodied spirit who can temporarily take possession of any living being in order to fight evil forces. 

Deadman has also appeared in various media outside comics. He is voiced by Raphael Sbarge in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, Michael Rosenbaum in &quot;&quot;, and Nicholas Turturro in &quot;Justice League Dark&quot;. 

==Creation==
Arnold Drake spoke on the development of Deadman and revealed the 1966 original concept sketch of the character, which was initially a muscular skeleton. Drake further stated, &quot;They were looking for something to bolster a magazine that was about to die, and I came up with Deadman, and they were going to turn it down, [but] then they bought the idea, but decided to turn down the title, because they were afraid, that the board would not permit them to title [the comic Deadman], because of the comics code of authority, so I said you fight for that, it&#x27;s a good title, they did and Deadman succeeded.

Drake later recalled in an interview, &quot;So here I was in the middle of a Zen-Buddhist movement and I thought, 
&quot;Maybe I can use that for my main character.&quot;

==Publication history==

Deadman&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #205, written by Arnold Drake and drawn by Carmine Infantino, included the first known depiction of narcotics in a story approved by the Comics Code Authority. The series is most associated with the art and writing of Neal Adams and the writing of Jack Miller, who took over from Infantino and Drake after the first story. The first story and all of the Adams stories were reprinted in 1985 as a seven-issue series.

Although he appeared occasionally in the 1970s and 1980s as a supporting character in various comics, including Jack Kirby&#x27;s &quot;Forever People&quot;, Deadman did not get his own series again until 1986, in a four-issue limited series written by Andrew Helfer and drawn by José Luis García-López, which picked up the story where Adams left off. Deadman&#x27;s next major storyline was in &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot;, in 1988–1989. After this, he starred in the two-issue series &quot;Deadman: Love After Death&quot;, drawn by Kelley Jones and written by Mike Baron. This was followed by the limited series &quot;Deadman: Exorcism&quot; in 1992, also written by Mike Baron and drawn by Kelley Jones. Jones&#x27; gaunt, zombie-like rendition of the character would later appear in the pages of &quot;Batman&quot;. There was a Deadman ongoing series in 2002, which lasted nine issues, as well as a couple of standalone issues. His cameo appearances also continued, including several issues of Alan Moore&#x27;s run on &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, and Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;. He had a cameo in books two and three of &quot;&quot;, which was released in November 2005. In 2009, Deadman was a featured title in the Wednesday Comics.

The character and self-titled series have won several awards, including the 1967 Alley Award for Best New Strip (by Arnold Drake and Carmine Infantino in &quot;Strange Adventures&quot;), and the 1968 Alley Award Hall of Fame (for Neal Adams). DC Comics published a slipcased hardcover edition collecting the original Deadman stories in December 2001. Deadman&#x27;s retconned origin is revealed in &quot;Brightest Day&quot; #14 (2010), written by Geoff Johns and Peter Tomasi. Deadman had a three-part miniseries called &quot;Deadman: Dark Mansion of Forbidden Love&quot; written by Sarah Vaughn with art by Lan Medina.

==Fictional character biography==
Circus trapeze artist Boston Brand performs under the name Deadman, a stage persona that includes a red costume and white corpse makeup. When Brand is murdered during a trapeze performance by a mysterious assailant known only as the Hook, his spirit is given the power to possess any living being by the Hindu god Rama Kushna to search for his murderer and obtain justice. It is established in &quot;Green Arrow&quot; (vol. 4) #4 that Deadman believes Rama is the supreme being of the universe.

At the end of the Neal Adams story line, Deadman seems to discover the truth behind his murder and the ultimate fate of Hook, who killed him as part of an initiation into a society of contract killers. However, the real Hook is one among many one-handed men who work for an organization known as &quot;The Scavengers&quot;. This group steals advanced technology for a profit. Fighting the Scavengers also led to Deadman gaining an artificial body from the Forever People. This group had rented rooms from Trixie Magruder, an old circus companion of Deadman.

===Various missions===
Rama Kushna also maintained a city for some time, called Nanda Parbat, where she rehabilitated criminals with her power. One of the worst was Darius Caldera, who almost destroyed the world when he left the city. Nanda Parbat later fell due to a combined military and mystical force. All the evil people are now back in the real world, still a danger. Brand&#x27;s twin brother, Cleveland, is killed while possessed by Boston, while he&#x27;s performing Boston&#x27;s circus act. The killer was out to kill Boston Brand. Rama also dies to defeat Jonah, a spirit similar to Deadman. Around this time, Deadman assists the Spectre in battling a demon before being forced to fuse with him after the demon injures him.

Later, Deadman receives a birthday present from his diminutive friend, Max Loomis. Max places himself in a trance to &quot;meet&quot; Deadman and the two take a pleasant journey down &quot;memory lane&quot;, mainly Deadman&#x27;s more pleasant memories of Nanda Parbat. Soon after, Loomis meets with old circus friends and Deadman involves himself in a case of suspected murder. Deadman wants to go after the escapees of Nanda Parbat, but Max thinks pursuing the murder is a better course. Over several years, a mysterious stranger has Deadman travel through time to try to save the souls of deceased heroes from Caldera. Due to the mental influence of various forces, Deadman is unable to use the knowledge of the timestream to benefit humanity. With the assistance of the spirits of the deceased heroes, Deadman defeats Caldera and the powers behind him. Max Loomis provides vital help on the material plane. After that, Boston and Loomis decide to hunt down the other Parbat escapees.

===Youth and Hell===
In the &quot;Sins of Youth&quot; incident, Deadman is one of the dozens of heroes reduced to a preteen age by Klarion the Witch Boy and an alien machine owned by Doiby Dickles. He assists Secret in confronting Teekl, Klarion&#x27;s cat familiar, in an effort to restore everyone. He also joins in the fight against mystically created and mystically altered villains. During &quot;Day of Judgment&quot;, Boston Brand travels with a group of heroes to the frozen wastelands of Hell. Their goal is to restart the demonic fires, thus recalling all the demons from the earthly plane. An accident strands Brand and the others under the frozen waters of the River Styx, forcing them to live out what would be, to them, Hell. For Brand, it is that the sharpshooter hits him in the shoulder, thus he survives. Brand feels he needs to die to learn &quot;how to live&quot;. His battles against the demons would come back to haunt him. In the four-part &quot;Black Baptism&quot; miniseries, Deadman and several other &quot;Sentinels of Magic&quot;, the magical group formed after the &quot;Day of Judgment&quot; incident, are hunted by the Diablos. Partly fueled by revenge, they subdue many of the Sentinels and drain their magic. The JLA eventually rescue them all and destroy all the Diablos.

===Blackest Night===

Boston Brand begins to hear the voices of the dead and his own remains calling for him to protect them. Being a spirit, he is unable to stop his body from being raised as a Black Lantern. He attempts to possess his own body but is ejected after experiencing extreme pain during the attempt. He assists Batman, Robin, and Red Robin in repelling the Black Lantern invasion. Deadman manages to save Commissioner Gordon from the Black Lanterns by possessing the body of his daughter, spiriting them both to safety.

Deadman is later sent by Batman to possess Jason Blood, invoking the power of Etrigan. Deadman uses Etrigan&#x27;s demon flame to hold back the Black Lanterns, but struggles to maintain control of his body and is forced out. Deadman then frees Batman and Red Robin, who had frozen themselves to escape the Black Lanterns&#x27; onslaught. He is later seen inside the Black Lantern Damage&#x27;s ring, apparently having followed Jean Loring, Mera and the Atom when they shrank down to enter it. He frees Mera and the Atom from Loring by briefly possessing her, allowing them to return to normal size. During this incident, he says he believes possessing the Black Lanterns causes him damage. He is later seen at Nanda Parbat, attempting to stop the Black Lanterns attempting to pass through the spiritual barrier by taking over their bodies and ripping them apart. He briefly loses himself to a Black Lantern&#x27;s personality, but is saved by the Phantom Stranger. The Stranger convinces Deadman to enter his body again, telling them it is his destiny to bring it within Nanda Parbat. With the Stranger&#x27;s help, Deadman forces the black ring off his body, bringing it through the gate of Nanda Parbat. The body, which the Stranger states is of &quot;singular importance&quot;, is placed under the gatekeeper and Blue Devil&#x27;s protection, and Deadman heads out, intent on sharing the information he gleaned while inside the Black Lanterns with Hal Jordan. In the aftermath of the final battle, Deadman is restored to life by a White Lantern ring.

===Brightest Day===
In the 2010–11 miniseries &quot;Brightest Day&quot;, Deadman discovers that his white ring can resurrect others. He begins to acclimate to living again, including exercising self-preservational habits, but expresses reservations about being alive again. As he attempts to learn what his mission on Earth is, he teams up with Hawk and Dove. Deadman learns that he will cross paths with the person the Entities chose to guard the Earth. The Entity also instructs Deadman to embrace life and those around him, as he led a selfish life in his previous one, realizing the value of others only after he died. In learning to appreciate his new life, Deadman realizes that he and Dove have fallen in love, and reconnects with his grandfather.

The Entity also tells Deadman that when Nekron attacked Earth, he created a &quot;dark avatar&quot; who will try to destroy the Star City forest and Earth&#x27;s soul. The Entity reveals that Earth&#x27;s savior is Alec Holland, and the &quot;dark avatar&quot; is a corrupted Swamp Thing. After Captain Boomerang accidentally kills Deadman, he gives his power ring to Holland, transforming him into a new Swamp Thing who kills the original.

===The New 52===
In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, Deadman&#x27;s origins are reimagined in the initial run of the anthology series &quot;DC Universe Presents&quot;. After living a selfish life as Boston Brand, he is forced to possess people as Deadman following his assassination to solve their problems and avoid being sent to Hell. He also features as a member of the supernatural team, Justice League Dark. Deadman uses his possession talents to help take down various supernatural threats, such as Dr. Mist and Faust. Despite their earlier claim, he and Dove try to rekindle their love. However, their attempt fails as Deadman insists on carrying on their relationship forward using borrowed bodies, while Dove shows disdain and repulsion to the idea. Furthermore, by helping out June Moone, they both gain the enmity of a crazed Enchantress.

===DC Rebirth===
As part of the DC Rebirth relaunch, a three-part miniseries, &quot;Deadman: Dark Mansion of Forbidden Love&quot; was released in October 2016. The story featured the creative team of writer Sarah Vaughn and artist Lan Medina. Deadman also appears in the &quot;Trinity&quot; book, focused on Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, along with Justice League Dark teammates Zatanna and John Constantine.

===Dawn of DC===
In &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, Deadman helps Doctor Fate and Detective Chimp fight Per Degaton and investigate Hauhet, the new guiding force behind the Helmet of Fate.

Deadman is a central character in the &quot;Knight Terrors&quot; event, where he helps battle the nightmare-controlling villain Insomnia. He sacrifices himself to defeat Insomnia, but is resurrected by Rama Kushna.

<text>The Gothic Line (; ) was a German and Italian defensive line of the Italian Campaign of World War II. It formed Field Marshal Albert Kesselring&#x27;s last major line of defence along the summits of the northern part of the Apennine Mountains during the fighting retreat of the Axis forces in Italy against the Allied Armies in Italy, commanded by General Sir Harold Alexander.

Adolf Hitler had concerns about the state of preparation of the Gothic Line: he feared the Allies would use amphibious landings to outflank its defences. To downgrade its importance in the eyes of both friend and foe, he ordered the name, with its historic connotations, changed, reasoning that if the Allies managed to break through they would not be able to use the more impressive name to magnify their victory claims. In response to this order, Kesselring renamed it the &quot;Green Line&quot; (&quot;Grüne Linie&quot;) in June 1944.

Using more than 15,000 slave labourers, the Germans created more than 2,000 well-fortified machine gun nests, casemates, bunkers, observation posts and artillery fighting positions to repel any attempt to breach the Gothic Line. Initially, this line was breached during Operation Olive (also sometimes known as the Battle of Rimini), but Kesselring&#x27;s forces were consistently able to retire in good order. This continued to be the case up to March 1945, with the Gothic Line being breached but with no decisive breakthrough; this would not take place until April 1945 during the final Allied offensive of the Italian Campaign.

Operation Olive has been described as the biggest battle of materials ever fought in Italy. Over 1,200,000 men participated in the battle. The battle took the form of a pincer manoeuvre, carried out by the British Eighth Army and the U.S. Fifth Army against the German 10th Army (10. &quot;Armee&quot;) and German 14th Army (14. &quot;Armee&quot;). Rimini, a city which had been hit by previous air raids, had 1,470,000 rounds fired against it by allied land forces. According to Lieutenant-General Oliver Leese, commander of the British Eighth Army: &quot;The battle of Rimini was one of the hardest battles of Eighth Army. The fighting was comparable to El Alamein, Mareth, and the Gustav Line (Monte-Cassino).&quot;

==Background==
After the nearly concurrent breakthroughs at Cassino and Anzio in spring 1944, the 11 nations representing the Allies in Italy finally had a chance to trap the Germans in a pincer movement and to realize some of the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill&#x27;s strategic goals for the long, costly campaign against the Axis &quot;underbelly&quot;. This would have required the U.S. Fifth Army under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark to commit most of his Anzio forces to the drive east from Cisterna, and to execute the envelopment envisioned in the original planning for the Anzio landing (i.e., flank the German 10th Army, and sever its northbound line of retreat from Cassino). Instead, fearing that the British Eighth Army, under Lieutenant-General Sir Oliver Leese, might beat him to the Italian capital of Rome, Clark diverted a large part of his Anzio force in that direction in an attempt to ensure that he and the Fifth Army would have the honour of liberating the city.

As a result, most of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Albert Kesselring&#x27;s forces slipped the noose and fell back north fighting delaying actions, notably in late June on the Trasimene Line (running from just south of Ancona on the east coast, past the southern shores of Lake Trasimeno near Perugia and on to the west coast south of Grosseto) and in July on the Arno Line (running from the west coast along the line of the Arno River and into the Apennine Mountains north of Arezzo). This gave time to consolidate the Gothic Line, a deep belt of fortifications extending from south of La Spezia (on the west coast) to the Foglia Valley, through the natural defensive wall of the Apennines (which ran unbroken nearly from coast to coast, deep and with high crests and peaks rising to ), to the Adriatic Sea between Pesaro and Ravenna, on the east coast. The emplacements included numerous concrete-reinforced gun pits and trenches and 2,376 machine-gun nests with interlocking fire, 479 anti-tank, mortar and assault gun positions, of barbed wire and many miles of anti-tank ditches. This last redoubt proved the Germans&#x27; determination to continue fighting.

Nevertheless, it was fortunate for the Allies that at this stage of the war the Italian partisan forces had become highly effective in disrupting the German preparations in the high mountains. On 2 April 1944, partisans belonging to the Eighth Garibaldi Brigade managed to occupy Sant&#x27;Agata Feltria; their ambush of a German detachment sent to round up partisans led to the Fragheto massacre on 7 April. By September 1944, German generals were no longer able to move freely in the area behind their main lines because of partisan activity. &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Frido von Senger und Etterlin—commanding XIV &quot;Panzer&quot; Corps (&quot;XIV Panzerkorps&quot;)—later wrote that he had taken to travelling in a little Volkswagen &quot;(displaying) no general&#x27;s insignia of rank—no peaked cap, no gold or red flags...&quot;. One of his colleagues who ignored this caution—Wilhelm Crisolli (commanding the 20th &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Field Division)—was caught and killed by partisans as he returned from a conference at corps headquarters.

Construction of the defences was also hampered by the deliberately poor quality concrete provided by local Italian mills whilst captured partisans forced into the construction gangs supplemented the natural lethargy of forced labour with clever sabotage. Nevertheless, prior to the Allies&#x27; attack, Kesselring had declared himself satisfied with the work done, especially on the Adriatic side where he &quot;...contemplated an assault on the left wing...with a certain confidence&quot;.

===Allied strategy===
The Italian Front was seen by the Allies to be of secondary importance to the offensives through France, and this was underlined by the withdrawal during the summer of 1944 of seven divisions from the U.S. Fifth Army to take part in the landings in southern France, Operation Dragoon. By 5 August, the strength of the Fifth Army had fallen from 249,000 to 153,000, and they had only 18 divisions to confront the combined German 10th and 14th Armies′ strength of 14 divisions plus four to seven reserve divisions.

Nevertheless, Winston Churchill and the British Chiefs of Staff were keen to break through the German defences to open up the route to the northeast through the &quot;Ljubljana Gap&quot; into Austria and Hungary. Whilst this would threaten Germany from the rear, Churchill was more concerned to forestall the Russians advancing into central Europe. The U.S. Chiefs of Staff had strongly opposed this strategy as diluting the Allied focus in France. However, following the Allied successes in France during the summer, the U.S. Chiefs relented, and there was complete agreement amongst the Combined Chiefs of Staff at the Second Quebec Conference on 12 September.

===Allied plan of attack===

The original plan of General Sir Harold Alexander, the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the Allied Armies in Italy (AAI)—as formulated by his Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General Sir John Harding—was to storm the Gothic Line in the centre, where most of his forces were already concentrated. It was the shortest route to his objective, the plains of Lombardy, and could be mounted quickly. He mounted a deception operation to convince the Germans that the main blow would come on the Adriatic front.

On 4 August, Alexander met Lieutenant-General Leese, the British Eighth Army commander, to find that Leese did not favour the plan. He argued that the Allies had lost their specialist French mountain troops to Operation Dragoon and that the Eighth Army&#x27;s strength lay in tactics combining infantry, armour and guns which could not be employed in the high mountains of the central Apennines.

It has also been suggested that Leese disliked working in league with Clark after the Fifth Army&#x27;s controversial move on Rome at the end of May and early June and wished for the Eighth Army to win the battle on its own. He suggested a surprise attack along the Adriatic coast. Although Harding did not share Leese&#x27;s view and Eighth Army planning staff had already rejected the idea of an Adriatic offensive (because it would be difficult to bring the necessary concentration of forces to bear), General Alexander was not prepared to force Leese to adopt a plan which was against his inclination and judgement and Harding was persuaded to change his mind.

Operation Olive—as the new offensive was christened—called for Leese&#x27;s Eighth Army to attack up the Adriatic coast toward Pesaro and Rimini and draw in the German reserves from the centre of the country. Clark&#x27;s Fifth Army would then attack in the weakened central Apennines north of Florence toward Bologna with British XIII Corps on the right wing of the attack fanning toward the coast to create a pincer with the Eighth Army advance. This meant that as a preparatory move, the bulk of the Eighth Army had to be transferred from the centre of Italy to the Adriatic coast, taking two valuable weeks, while a new intelligence deception plan (Operation Ulster) was commenced to convince Kesselring that the main attack would be in the centre.

==Adriatic Front (British Eighth Army)==

===Eighth Army dispositions for Operation Olive===
On the coast, Leese had Polish II Corps with 5th Kresowa Division in the front line and the 3rd Carpathian Division in reserve. To the left of the Poles was Canadian I Corps which had the Canadian 1st Infantry Division (with the British 21st Tank Brigade under command) in the front line and the Canadian 5th Armoured Division in reserve.

For the opening phase the corps artillery was strengthened with the addition of the British 4th Infantry Division&#x27;s artillery. West of the Canadians was British V Corps with the British 46th Infantry Division manning the right of the corps front line and 4th Indian Infantry Division its left. In reserve were the British 56th Infantry and 1st Armoured Divisions and the British 7th Armoured and 25th Tank Brigades.

Further to the rear was the British 4th Division, waiting to be called forward to join the corps. The left flank of the Eighth Army front was guarded by British X Corps employing the 10th Indian Infantry Division and two armoured car regiments, 12th and 27th Lancers. Prior to the attack the I Canadian Corps&#x27; front was covered by patrolling Polish cavalry units and V Corps by patrolling elements of the Italian Liberation Corps. In army reserve, also waiting to be called forward, was the 2nd New Zealand Division.

===German 10th Army dispositions===
Facing the Eighth Army was the German 10th Army&#x27;s LXXVI &quot;Panzer&quot; Corps (&quot;LXXVI Panzerkorps&quot;). Initially, this had only three divisions: 1st Parachute Division facing the Poles, 71st Infantry Division (&quot;71. Infanterie-Division&quot;) inland on the parachute division&#x27;s right and 278th Division (&quot;278. Infanterie-Division&quot;) on the Corps right flank in the hills which was in the process of relieving 5th Mountain Division. The 10th Army had a further five divisions in 51st Mountain Corps covering of front line on the right of LXVI &quot;Panzer&quot; Corps and a further two divisions—162nd Infantry Division (&quot;162. (Turkoman) Infanterie-Division&quot;) and 98th Infantry Division (&quot;98. Infanterie-Division&quot;) (replaced by 29th &quot;Panzer Grenadier&quot; Division (&quot;29. Panzergrenadierdivision&quot;) from 25 August)—covering the Adriatic coast behind LXVI Corps. In addition, Kesselring had in his Army Group Reserve the 90th &quot;Panzer&quot; Grenadier Division (&quot;90. Panzergrenadierdivision&quot;) and 26th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division (&quot;26. Panzerdivision&quot;).

===Eighth Army attack===
The British Eighth Army crossed the Metauro river and launched its attack against the Gothic Line outposts on 25 August. As Polish II Corps, on the coast and I Canadian Corps, on the coastal plain on the Poles&#x27; left, advanced towards Pesaro the coastal plain narrowed and it was planned that the Polish Corps, weakened by losses and lack of replacements, would go into Army reserve and the front on the coastal plain would become the responsibility of the Canadian Corps alone. The Germans were taken by surprise, to the extent that both von Vietinghoff, and the parachute division&#x27;s commander—&quot;Generalmajor &quot; Richard Heidrich—were away on leave.

They were in the process of pulling back their forward units to the Green I fortifications of the Gothic Line proper and Kesselring was uncertain whether this was the start of a major offensive or just Eighth Army advancing to occupy vacated ground whilst the main Allied attack would come on the U.S. Fifth Army front towards Bologna. On 27 August, he was still expressing the view that the attack was a diversion and so would not commit reserves to the front. It was not until 28 August—when he saw a captured copy of Leese&#x27;s order of the day to his army prior to the attack—that Kesselring realised that a major offensive was in progress, and three divisions of reinforcements were ordered from Bologna to the Adriatic front, still needing at least two days to get into position.

By 30 August, the Canadian and British Corps had reached the Green I main defensive positions running along the ridges on the far side of the Foglia river. Taking advantage of the Germans&#x27; lack of manpower, the Canadians punched through and by 3 September had advanced a further to the Green II line of defences running from the coast near Riccione. The Allies were close to breaking through to Rimini and the Romagna plain. However, LXXVI &quot;Panzer&quot; Corps on the German 10th Army&#x27;s left wing had withdrawn in good order behind the line of the Conca river. Fierce resistance from the Corps′ 1st Parachute Division—commanded by Heidrich (supported by intense artillery fire from the Coriano ridge in the hills on the Canadians&#x27; left)—brought their advance to a halt.

Meanwhile, British V Corps was finding progress in the more difficult hill terrain with its poor roads tough going. On 3–4 September, while the Canadians once again attacked along the coastal plain, V Corps made an armoured thrust to dislodge the Coriano Ridge defences and reach the Marano river. This was to open the gate to the plain beyond which could be rapidly exploited by the tanks of British 1st Armoured Division, poised for this purpose. However, after two days of gruesome fighting with heavy losses on both sides, the Allies were obliged to call off their assault and reassess their strategy. Leese decided to outflank the Coriano ridge positions by driving westwards toward Croce and Gemmano to reach the Marano valley which curved behind the Coriano positions to the coast some north of Riccione.

===Battles for Gemmano and Croce===
The Battle of Gemmano has been nicknamed by some historians as the &quot;Cassino of the Adriatic&quot;. After 11 assaults between 4 and 13 September (first by British 56th Division and then British 46th Division), it was the turn of Indian 4th Division who after a heavy bombardment made the 12th attack at 03:00 on 15 September and finally carried and secured the German defensive positions. In the meantime, to the north, on the other side of the Conca valley a similarly bloody engagement was being ground out at Croce. The German 98th Division held their positions with great tenacity, and it took five days of constant fighting, often door to door and hand to hand before the British 56th Division captured Croce.

===Coriano taken and the advance to Rimini and San Marino===
With progress slow at Gemmano, Leese decided to renew the attack on Coriano. After a paralyzing bombardment from 700 artillery pieces and bombers, the Canadian 5th Armoured Division and the British 1st Armoured Division launched their attack on the night of 12 September. The Coriano positions were finally taken on 14 September.

Once again, the way was open to Rimini. Kesselring&#x27;s forces had taken heavy losses, and three divisions of reinforcements ordered to the Adriatic front would not be available for at least a day. Now, the weather intervened: torrential rain turned the rivers into torrents and halted air support operations. Once again movement ground to a crawl, and the German defenders had the opportunity to reorganise and reinforce their positions on the Marano river, and the salient to the Lombardy plain closed. Once more, the Eighth Army was confronted by an organised line of defence, the Rimini Line.

Meanwhile, with Croce and beyond it Montescudo secured, the left wing of the Eighth Army advanced to the Marano river and the frontier of San Marino. The Germans had occupied neutral San Marino over a week previously to take advantage of the heights on which the city-state stood. By 19 September, the city was isolated and fell to the Allies with relatively little cost. beyond San Marino lay the Marecchia valley running across the Eighth Army line of advance and running to the sea at Rimini.

During the night of 19/20 September, Brigadier Richard W. Goodbody, commanding the 2nd Armoured Brigade, ordered (with many doubts) the 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen&#x27;s Bays) to attack Pt 153 at 10.50. The German antitank gunners, using the renowned 88mm guns, had a field day. All but three Sherman tanks of the two squadrons that took part in the attack were destroyed. The Bays lost 24 tanks and, more important, 64 highly skilled tank crewmen. Fortunately for the 9th Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers, who had been ordered to pass through the Bays, their attack was postponed after strong representations had been made to higher HQ.

On the right the I Canadian Corps on 20 September broke the German positions on the Ausa river and into the Lombardy Plain and 3rd Greek Mountain Brigade entered Rimini on the morning of 21 September as the Germans withdrew from their positions on the Rimini Line behind the Ausa to new positions on the Marecchia. However, Kesselring&#x27;s defence had won him time until the onset of the autumn rains. Progress for the Eighth Army became very slow with mud slides caused by the torrential rain making it difficult to keep roads and tracks open, creating a logistical nightmare. Although they were out of the hills, the plains were waterlogged and the Eighth Army found themselves confronted, as they had the previous autumn, by a succession of swollen rivers running across their line of advance. Once again, the conditions prevented Eighth Army&#x27;s armour from exploiting the breakthrough, and the infantry of British V Corps and I Canadian Corps (joined by the 2nd New Zealand Division) had to grind their way forward while von Vietinghoff withdrew his forces behind the next river beyond the Marecchia, the Uso, a few miles beyond Rimini. The positions on the Uso were forced on 26 September, and Eighth Army reached the next river, the Fiumicino, on 29 September. Four days of heavy rain forced a halt, and by this time V Corps was fought out and required major reorganization.

Since the start of Operation Olive, Eighth Army had suffered 14,000 casualties. As a result, British battalions had to be reduced from four to three rifle companies due to a severe shortage of manpower. Facing the Eighth Army LXXVI &quot;Panzer&quot; Corps had suffered 16,000 casualties. As the Eighth Army paused at the end of September to reorganise Leese was reassigned to command the Allied land forces in South-East Asia and Lieutenant-General Richard L. McCreery was moved from commanding British X Corps to take over the army command.

==Central Front (Fifth Army)==
===U.S. Fifth Army formation===
Clark&#x27;s U.S. Fifth Army comprised three corps: U.S. IV Corps, under Major General Willis D. Crittenberger, on the left formed by the U.S. 1st Armored Division, the 6th South African Armoured Division and two Regimental Combat Teams (RCTs), one of the U.S. 92nd Infantry Division the other the Brazilian 6th RCT (the first land forces contingent of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force); in the centre was U.S. II Corps, under Major General Geoffrey Keyes, (with the U.S. 34th, 85th, 88th and 91st Infantry Divisions supported by three tank battalions under command); and on the right British XIII Corps, under Lieutenant-General Sidney Kirkman, (composed of the British 1st Infantry and 6th Armoured Divisions, the 8th Indian Infantry Division and the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade). Like the Eighth Army, the Fifth Army was considered to be strong in armour and short on infantry considering the terrain they were attacking.

===German formation in the central Apennines===
In the front line facing Clark&#x27;s forces were five divisions of Joachim Lemelsen&#x27;s German 14th Army (20th &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Field Division, 16th SS &quot;Panzer&quot; Grenadier Division (16. &quot;Panzergrenadierdivision&quot;), 65th and 362nd Infantry Divisions and the 4th Parachute Division) and two divisions on the western end of von Vietinghoff&#x27;s German 10th Army (356th and 715th Infantry Divisions). By the end of the first week in September, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Field Division and the 356th Infantry Division had been moved to the Adriatic front along with (from army reserve) the 29th &quot;Panzer&quot; Grenadier Division and the armoured reserve of 26th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division. The 14th Army was not of the same quality as the 10th Army: it had been badly mauled in the retreat from Anzio and some of its replacements had been hastily and inadequately trained.

===Allied plan===
Clark&#x27;s plan was for II Corps to strike along the road from Florence to Firenzuola and Imola through the Il Giogo pass to outflank the formidable defences of the Futa pass (on the main Florence–Bologna road) while on their right British XIII Corps would advance through the Gothic Line to cut Route 9 (and therefore Kesselring&#x27;s lateral communications) at Faenza. The transfer of 356th Infantry Division to the Adriatic weakened the defences around the Il Giogo pass which was already potentially an area of weakness, being on the boundary between 10th and 14th Armies.

===Battle===

During the last week in August, U.S. II Corps and British XIII Corps started to move into the mountains to take up positions for the main assault on the main Gothic Line defences. Some fierce resistance was met from outposts but at the end of the first week in September, once reorganisation had taken place following the withdrawal of three divisions to reinforce the pressured Adriatic front, the Germans withdrew to the main Gothic Line defences. After an artillery bombardment, the Fifth Army&#x27;s main assault began at dusk on 12 September. Keyes tried to flank the II Giogo Pass by attacking both the peaks of Monticello and Monte Altuzzo using the 91st Infantry Division in a bold attempt to bounce the Germans off the positions, but this failed.

Progress at the II Giogo Pass was slow, but on II Corps&#x27; right British XIII Corps were making better progress. Clark grasped this opportunity to divert part of II Corps reserve (the 337th Infantry Regiment, part of the 85th Infantry Division) to exploit XIII Corps success. Attacking on 17 September, supported by both American and British artillery, the infantry fought their way onto Monte Pratone, some east of the Il Giogo pass and a key position on the Gothic Line. Meanwhile, U.S. II Corps renewed their assault on Monte Altuzzo, dominating the east side of the Il Giogo Pass. The Altuzzo positions fell on the morning of 17 September, after five days of fighting. The capture of Altuzzo and Pratone as well as Monte Verruca between them caused the formidable Futa Pass defences to be outflanked, and Lemelsen was forced to pull back, leaving the pass to be taken after only light fighting on 22 September.

On the left, IV Corps had fought their way to the main Gothic Line: notably the 370th Infantry Regiment, which pushed the Axis troops on its sector to the north beyond the Highway 12 towards Gallicano; and the Brazilian 6th RCT, which took Massarosa, Camaiore and other small towns on its own way north. By the end of the month, the Brazilian unit had conquered &quot;Monte Prano&quot; and controlled the Serchio valley region without suffering any major casualties. In October, it also took Fornaci with its munitions factory, and Barga; while the 370th received reinforcements from other units (365th and 371st), to ensure the Fifth Army left wing sector at the Ligurian Sea.

On Fifth Army&#x27;s far right wing, on the right of the British XIII Corps front, 8th Indian Infantry Division fighting across trackless ground had captured the heights of Femina Morta and British 6th Armoured Division had taken the San Godenzo Pass on Route 67 to Forlì, both on 18 September.

At this stage, with the slow progress on the Adriatic front, Clark decided that Bologna would be too far west along Route 9 to trap the German 10th Army. He decided therefore to make the main II Corps thrust further east towards Imola whilst XIII Corps would continue to push on the right toward Faenza. Although they were through the Gothic Line, Fifth Army—just like the Eighth Army before them—found the terrain beyond and its defenders even more difficult. Between 21 September and 3 October, U.S. 88th Division had fought its way to a standstill on the route to Imola suffering 2,105 men killed and wounded — roughly the same as the whole of the rest of II Corps during the actual breaching of the Gothic Line.

The fighting toward Imola had drawn German troops from the defence of Bologna, and Clark decided to switch his main thrust back toward the Bologna axis. U.S. II Corps pushed steadily through the Raticosa Pass and by 2 October, it had reached Monghidoro some from Bologna. However, as it had on the Adriatic coast, the weather had broken and rain and low cloud prevented air support while the roads back to the ever more distant supply dumps near Florence became morasses.

On 5 October, U.S. II Corps renewed its offensive along a front straddling Route 65 to Bologna. They were supported on their right flank by British XIII Corps including British 78th Infantry Division, newly returned to Italy after a three-month re-fit in Egypt. Gradual progress was made against stiffening opposition as German 14th Army moved troops from the quieter sector opposite U.S. IV Corps. By 9 October, they were attacking the massive high sheer escarpment behind Livergnano which appeared insuperable. However, the weather cleared on the morning of 10 October to allow artillery and air support to be brought to bear. Nevertheless, it took until the end of 15 October before the escarpment was secured. On the right of U.S. II Corps British XIII Corps was experiencing equally determined fighting on terrain just as difficult.

==Time runs out for the Allied offensive==

By the second half of October, it was becoming increasingly clear to Alexander that despite the dogged fighting in the waterlogged plain of Romagna and the streaming mountains of the central Apennines, with the autumn well advanced and exhaustion and combat losses increasingly affecting his forces&#x27; capabilities, no breakthrough was going to occur before the winter weather returned.

On the Adriatic front, the British Eighth Army&#x27;s advance resumed on its left wing through the Apennine foothills toward Forlì on Route 9. On 5 October the 10th Indian Infantry Division—switched from British X Corps to British V Corps—had crossed the Fiumicino river high in the hills and turned the German defensive line on the river forcing the German 10th Army units downstream to pull back towards Bologna. Paradoxically, in one sense, this helped Kesselring because it shortened the front he had to defend and shortened the distance between his two armies, providing him with greater flexibility to switch units between the two fronts. Continuing their push up Route 9, on 21 October British V Corps crossed the Savio river which runs north eastward through Cesena to the Adriatic and by 25 October were closing on the Ronco river, some beyond the Savio, behind which the Germans had withdrawn. By the end of the month, the advance had reached Forlì, halfway between Rimini and Bologna.

Cutting the German Armies&#x27; lateral communications remained a key objective. Indeed, later Kesselring was to say that if in mid-October the front south of Bologna could not be held, then all the German positions east of Bologna &quot;were automatically gone.&quot; Alexander and Clark had decided therefore to make a last push for Bologna before winter gripped the front.

On 16 October, the U.S. Fifth Army had gathered itself for one last effort to take Bologna. The Allies were short of artillery ammunition because of a global reduction in Allied ammunition production in anticipation of the final defeat of Germany. The Fifth Army&#x27;s batteries were rationed to such an extent that the total rounds fired in the last week of October were less than the amount fired during one eight-hour period on 2 October. Nevertheless, U.S. II Corps and British XIII Corps pounded away for the next 11 days. Little progress was made in the centre along the main road to Bologna. On the right, there was better progress, and on 20 October the U.S. 88th Division seized Monte Grande, only from Route 9, and three days later British 78th Division stormed Monte Spaduro. However, the remaining were over difficult terrain and were reinforced by three of the best German divisions in Italy—the 29th Panzergrenadier Division, 90th Panzergrenadier Division and the 1st Parachute Division—which Kesselring had been able to withdraw from the Romagna as a result of his shortened front. By late October, the Brazilian 6th RCT had pushed the Axis forces through province of Lucca to Barga, where its advance was halted.

==Later operations==
In early November, the buildup to full strength of the 1st Brazilian Division and some reinforcement of the U.S. 92nd Division had not nearly compensated the U.S. Fifth Army for the formations diverted to France. The situation in the British Eighth Army was even worse: Replacement cadres were being diverted to northern Europe and I Canadian Corps was ordered to prepare to ship to the Netherlands in February of the following year. Also, while they remained held in the mountains, the armies continued to have an over-preponderance of armour relative to infantry.

During November and December, Fifth Army concentrated on dislodging the Germans from their well-placed artillery positions which had been key in preventing the Allied advance towards Bologna and the Po Valley. Using small and medium Brazilian and American forces, the U.S. Fifth Army attacked these points one by one but with no positive outcome. By the end of the year, the defence compound formed by the Germans around Monte Castello, (&quot;Lizano in&quot;) Belvedere, Della Toraccia, Castelnuovo (di Vergato), Torre di Nerone, La Serra, Soprassasso and Castel D&#x27;Aiano had proved extremely resilient.

Meanwhile, the British Eighth Army—held on Route 9 at Forlì—continued a subsidiary drive up the Adriatic coast and captured Ravenna on 5 November. In early November, the push up Route 9 resumed, and the river Montone, just beyond Forlì, was crossed on 9 November. However, the going continued to be very tough with the river Cosina, some further along Route 9 being crossed only on 23 November. By 17 December, the river Lamone had been assaulted and Faenza cleared. The German 10th Army established itself on the raised banks of the river Senio (rising at least above the surrounding plain) which ran across the line of the Eighth Army advance just beyond Faenza down to the Adriatic north of Ravenna. With snows falling and winter firmly established, any attempt to cross the Senio was out of the question and the Eighth Army&#x27;s 1944 campaign came to an end.

In late December, in a final flourish to the year&#x27;s fighting, the Germans used a predominantly Italian force of units from the Italian Monterosa Division to attack the left wing of the U.S. Fifth Army in the Serchio valley in front of Lucca to pin Allied units there which might otherwise have been switched to the central front. Two brigades of the 8th Indian Infantry Division were rapidly switched across the Apennines to reinforce the U.S. 92nd Infantry Division. By the time the reinforcements had arrived, the Axis forces had broken through to capture Barga, but decisive action by the 8th Indian Division&#x27;s Major-General Dudley Russell halted further advance and the situation was stabilised and Barga recaptured by the New Year.

In mid-December Alexander became supreme commander of the Mediterranean Theatre. Clark took his place as commander of the Allied Armies in Italy (re-designated 15th Army Group) and command of U.S. Fifth Army was given to Lucian K. Truscott. In mid-February, as the winter weather improved, Fifth Army resumed its attacks on German artillery positions (&quot;Operation Encore&quot;). This time the IV Corps used two full infantry divisions to accomplish the mission: the Brazilian division, tasked with taking Monte Castello, Soprassasso and Castelnuovo di Vergato; and the newly arrived U.S. 10th Mountain Division, tasked to take Belvedere, Della Torraccia and Castel D&#x27;Aiano. Operation Encore began on 18 February and was completed on 5 March, preparatory to the final offensive in Italy.

<text>David Cay Boyle Johnston (born December 24, 1948) is an American investigative journalist and author, a specialist in economics and tax issues, and winner of the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Beat Reporting.

From July 2011 until September 2012 he was a columnist for Reuters, writing, and producing video commentaries, on worldwide issues of tax, accounting, economics, public finance and business. Johnston is the board president of Investigative Reporters and Editors. He has also written for Al Jazeera English and America in recent years. Johnston is currently a Professor of Practice in the College of Liberal Arts at Rochester Institute of Technology, and has also served as Distinguished Visiting Lecturer at College of Law and the Whitman School of Management at Syracuse University.

== Reporting ==
Johnston covered &quot;student radicals, black politics and development&quot; at the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; from 1968 to 1973. Although he &quot;earned enough credits for at least one master’s degree,&quot; his formal educational credentials are limited to a &quot;night high school diploma&quot; as he &quot;skipped most general education requirements in favor of upper division and graduate study at seven schools,&quot; including San Francisco State University (1972), the University of Chicago (where he studied under a five-month fellowship in 1973) and Michigan State University (1973-1975). At Michigan State, he wrote an internal textbook (&quot;A Guide to Public Records&quot;) for the university&#x27;s journalism department. From 1973 to 1976, he was an investigative reporter at the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; in its Lansing bureau. In 1976, he joined the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, where he remained until 1988. Johnston subsequently worked as a reporter at &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; from 1988 to 1995. He joined &quot;The New York Times&quot; in February 1995.

As a reporter Johnston investigated Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) political spying and other abuses, the hotelier Barron Hilton, misuse of charitable funds at United Way, news manipulation at WJIM-TV in Lansing, Michigan, and Donald Trump&#x27;s financial dealings. In 1983, Johnston&#x27;s reporting of newer information regarding a problematic murder investigation helped a man who had been previously tried four times to win an acquittal during his fifth trial, and was judged &quot;the best news story of the year by the California-Nevada editors of United Press International.&quot;

From February 1995 to April 2008, he was the tax reporter with &quot;The New York Times&quot;. For the next three years, until joining Reuters, he wrote &quot;Johnston&#x27;s Take&quot;, a column on tax policy for the nonprofit journal &quot;Tax Notes&quot; and its sister website tax.com, published by Tax Analysts. In 2009 he briefly wrote a column titled &quot;By the Numbers&quot; for &quot;The Nation&quot;.

Johnston received the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Beat Reporting &quot;for his penetrating and enterprising reporting that exposed loopholes and inequities in the U.S. tax code, which was instrumental in bringing about reforms. &quot;Johnston described how corporations were paying less in taxes, even as individuals were paying more, with even well-known companies like Colgate-Palmolive, Compaq Computer, and United Parcel Service (UPS) engaging in &quot;what the courts called shams.&quot; A court found that Merrill Lynch saved AlliedSignal (now Honeywell) $180 million in &quot;sham&quot; money transfers among foreign companies. However, the IRS is, since 1999, more likely to audit the poor than the rich, Johnston reported.

In 2001 Johnston investigated the claim that estate taxes were so high that farm families were being forced to sell their family farms in order to pay the taxes. This claim was presented to prove the need to eliminate the inheritance tax. Johnston challenged those who made that claim, such as the American Farm Bureau Federation, to cite an example of a farm that was lost because of estate taxes, and they were unable to do so. Economists told Johnston that it was a myth. An IRS analysis of 1999 returns found that almost no working farmers owe estate taxes. Estate taxes are not assessed on the first $1.35 million net worth, and then rise from 43 to 55 percent above $3 million. Additionally, most wealthy people use legal maneuvers to reduce their estate taxes significantly, to as little as zero in some cases.

He was a Pulitzer finalist in 2003 &quot;for his stories that displayed exquisite command of complicated U.S. tax laws and of how corporations and individuals twist them to their advantage.&quot; He was also a finalist in 2000 &quot;for his lucid coverage of problems resulting from the reorganization of the Internal Revenue Service.&quot;

Like columnist Steven Pearlstein, Johnston has won praise for his writing even though he has no degree in economics. Johnston studied economics at the University of Chicago graduate school and six other colleges, earning the equivalent of six years of college credits but no awarded degree, because he took upper level and graduate level courses almost exclusively, and did not remain at any one school long enough.

Johnston has been critical of news coverage of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a nearly $700 billion bailout of Wall Street in 2008. In a letter to American journalist and blogger Jim Romenesko, Johnston wrote, &quot;In covering the proposed $700 billion bailout of Wall Street don&#x27;t repeat the failed lapdog practices that so damaged our reputations in the rush to war in Iraq and the adoption of the Patriot Act. Don&#x27;t assume that Congress must act instantly, as so many news stories state as if it was an immutable fact. Don&#x27;t assume there is a case just because officials say there is.&quot; Johnston has been cited favorably by Glenn Greenwald as well as other bailout critics. On September 26, 2008, Johnston said: &quot;If you look around, you&#x27;ll notice that banks are still making ordinary loans to ordinary businesses. Your mailbox is still full of proposals to sell you credit cards and extend you debt. The Internet still has ads for these very toxic mortgages that are at the heart of this. They&#x27;re being advertised all over the Internet...And my point is not to argue that there is or is not a crisis, but that journalists need to begin not by questioning around the edges but by going to the core question. Is this the least expensive way to do this? Are there market solutions that might be applied?&quot;

In 2011, in his debut article for Reuters, Johnson mistook a positive number for a negative one in News Corp&#x27;s annual report, and as a result, his article said that News Corp had received a large tax refund, when in reality, it had paid taxes. This error led to a retraction of the article.

On March 14, 2017, Johnston released a portion of Donald Trump&#x27;s 2005 Form 1040 tax return which, he states, he received anonymously in the mail.

==DCReport==

In 2016, David Cay Johnston co-founded DCReport with David Crook, a veteran journalist who was founder and editor of The Wall Street Journal Sunday. DCReport is an online nonprofit news service that covers the US President and Congress. Johnston is Editor-in-Chief and David Crook is Managing Editor.

From 2019 to 2021, DCReport partnered with Raw Story providing original investigative reporting for Raw Story&#x27;s subscribers on financial regulation, taxes, energy, the environment, worker safety and corruption.

In December 2022, Johnston announced he would be stepping down as editor-in-chief, though continuing as an advisor and occasional contributor, and the Next Echo Foundation would be taking charge.

==Works==
Johnston is the author of best-selling books on tax and economic policy. &quot;Free Lunch: How the Wealthiest Americans Enrich Themselves at Government Expense and Stick You With The Bill&quot;, is about hidden subsidies, rigged markets, and corporate socialism. It follows his earlier book &quot;Perfectly Legal: The Covert Campaign to Rig Our Tax System to Benefit the Super Rich—and Cheat Everybody Else&quot;, a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller on the U.S. tax system that won the Investigative Reporters and Editors 2003 Book of the Year award.

Johnston&#x27;s first book, the 1992 &quot;Temples of Chance: How America Inc. Bought Out Murder Inc. to Win Control of the Casino Business&quot; is an account of how the junk-bond kings usurped mob control of the casino industry in the 1980s. The book discusses corruption in the industry and the role of the federal and state governments in that corruption.

In 2014 Johnston released &quot;Divided: The Perils of Our Growing Inequality&quot;. Cay Johnston shows most Americans, in inflation-adjusted terms, are now back to the average income of 1966. Post-recession (from 2009 to 2011) the top one percent of households took in 121 percent of the income gains while the bottom 99 percent saw their incomes fall.

In 2016, Johnston released &quot;The Making of Donald Trump&quot;, a journalistic account of the rise of businessperson-turned-presidential candidate Donald Trump. At the time he wrote the book, Johnston had known Trump for 28 years. The book was on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list.

Published in 2018 is &quot;It&#x27;s Even Worse Than You Think: What the Trump Administration is Doing to America&quot;, an investigative piece that details actions taken by Trump and his appointees at the departmental level, and how these actions affect Americans&#x27; rights and civil protections.

<doc id="522786" wikidata="Q3983973" url="?curid=522786" title="Homotopy lifting property">
<text>In mathematics, in particular in homotopy theory within algebraic topology, the homotopy lifting property (also known as an instance of the [[right lifting property]] or the covering homotopy axiom) is a technical condition on a continuous function from a topological space &quot;E&quot; to another one, &quot;B&quot;. It is designed to support the picture of &quot;E&quot; &quot;above&quot; &quot;B&quot; by allowing a homotopy taking place in &quot;B&quot; to be moved &quot;upstairs&quot; to &quot;E&quot;.

For example, a covering map has a property of &quot;unique&quot; local lifting of paths to a given sheet; the uniqueness is because the fibers of a covering map are discrete spaces. The homotopy lifting property will hold in many situations, such as the projection in a vector bundle, fiber bundle or fibration, where there need be no unique way of lifting.

==Formal definition==
Assume all maps are continuous functions between topological spaces. Given a map formula_1, and a space formula_2, one says that formula_3 has the homotopy lifting property, or that formula_4 has the homotopy lifting property with respect to formula_5, if:

*for any homotopy formula_6, and 
*for any map formula_7 lifting formula_8 (i.e., so that formula_9),

there exists a homotopy formula_10 lifting formula_11 (i.e., so that formula_12) which also satisfies formula_13.

The following diagram depicts this situation:

The outer square (without the dotted arrow) commutes if and only if the hypotheses of the lifting property are true. A lifting formula_14 corresponds to a dotted arrow making the diagram commute. This diagram is dual to that of the homotopy extension property; this duality is loosely referred to as Eckmann–Hilton duality.

If the map formula_15 satisfies the homotopy lifting property with respect to &quot;all&quot; spaces formula_5, then formula_15 is called a fibration, or one sometimes simply says that &quot;formula_15 has the homotopy lifting property&quot;.

A weaker notion of fibration is Serre fibration, for which homotopy lifting is only required for all CW complexes formula_5.

==Generalization: homotopy lifting extension property==
There is a common generalization of the homotopy lifting property and the homotopy extension property. Given a pair of spaces formula_20, for simplicity we denote formula_21. Given additionally a map formula_22, one says that &quot;formula_23 has the homotopy lifting extension property&quot; if:
* For any homotopy formula_24, and
* For any lifting formula_25 of formula_26, there exists a homotopy formula_27 which covers formula_28 (i.e., such that formula_29) and extends formula_30 (i.e., such that formula_31).

The homotopy lifting property of formula_32 is obtained by taking formula_33, so that formula_34 above is simply formula_35.

The homotopy extension property of formula_36 is obtained by taking formula_15 to be a constant map, so that formula_15 is irrelevant in that every map to &quot;E&quot; is trivially the lift of a constant map to the image point of formula_15.

<text>USS &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot; (CVE-95) was the fortieth of fifty s built to serve the United States Navy during World War II; she was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the Battle of the Bismarck Sea. Completed in May 1944, she served in support of the Philippines campaign, and the landings on Iwo Jima. On 21 February 1945, she sank off of Iwo Jima due to two Japanese kamikaze attacks, killing 318 crewmen. Notably, she was the last aircraft carrier in U.S. service to sink due to enemy action.

==Design and description==
&quot;Bismarck Sea&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck, a long flight deck. She was powered with two Uniflow reciprocating steam engines, which provided a force of , driving two shafts, enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of , assuming that she traveled at a constant speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow end, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one on the fore, another on the aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern, and she was equipped with 16 Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons, which were used in an anti-aircraft capability. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry 30 20 mm cannons, as a response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Anti-aircraft guns were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but she sometimes went over or under this number. For example, during the Philippines campaign, she carried 16 Wildcat FM-2 fighters and 12 Avenger TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 28 aircraft. During the Iwo Jima campaign, she carried 19 FM-2 fighters, and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 31 aircraft. She was designed to accommodate 764 crew, but in wartime, her complement inevitably crept over that number. A reasonable estimate puts the number of crew typically on board a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier at around 910 to 916 men.

==Construction and service history==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942, under the name &quot;Alikula Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was laid down on 31 January 1944, and was assigned the designation MC hull 1132. She was launched on 17 April 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Mabel C. Wallgren, wife of Senator Monrad Wallgren, under the name &quot;Alikula Bay&quot;. She was renamed &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot; on 16 May 1944, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent Casablanca-class carriers after naval or land engagements, and she was transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 20 May, with Captain John L. Pratt in command.
After being commissioned, &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot; engaged in training exercises off the West Coast throughout June. On 1 July, she left San Pedro ferrying aircraft and pilots to Pearl Harbor. After unloading her aircraft, she loaded more aircraft and ferried them to the Marshall Islands, arriving at Majuro Atoll on 16 July. She then proceeded back to Pearl Harbor, carrying damaged aircraft, arriving on 29 July, along with her sister ship . Throughout August, she was stationed at San Diego for a four-week overhaul, where she received her combat air contingent, Composite Squadron (VC) 86. Between 7 September, and 16 October, she engaged in additional training exercises. She then steamed to Ulithi, Caroline Islands, to join Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid&#x27;s 7th Fleet on 1 November. Between 14 and 23 November, she operated off Leyte and Mindanao in support of operations onboard Leyte. On 21 November, a Japanese aircraft made a strafing run along the carrier, but without inflicting any damage, and escaped to the northwest before it could be engaged.

On 27 November, she arrived at Seeadler Harbor, New Guinea, to join Task Group 77.4, commanded by Rear Admiral Calvin T. Durgin. Throughout December, she conducted additional flight training and gunnery exercises. On 27 December, she left for Palau, to support the invasion of Luzon. On 5 January 1945, her task group sighted the Japanese destroyers and . engaged in a brief and inconclusive firefight with the destroyers, before disengaging to provide a screen.

Twenty-four fighters and sixteen torpedo bombers were sent against the destroyers, which &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot; supplemented the strike group with four Avengers and the same amount of Wildcats. The aerial strike force inflicted serious damage on both of the destroyers, sinking &quot;Momi&quot;. &quot;Hinoki&quot;, albeit damaged, was able to escape into Manila harbor, but she was subsequently sunk on 7 January by aircraft from Task Force 78. However, that same day, the escort carrier was sunk by a kamikaze aircraft. The task group then participated in the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf and supported air operations over Luzon until 17 January, when the task group proceeded towards Ulithi in preparation for the invasion of Iwo Jima. She departed Ulithi on 10 February, reorganized into Task Unit 52.2, still under the command of Durgin, and consisting of ten escort carriers and their destroyer screens, along with two escort carriers loosely tied into the task group on anti-submarine duties. On 16 February, she arrived off Iwo Jima to support the landings. The task group&#x27;s aircraft conducted anti-submarine patrols, anti-aircraft patrols, and supported the first wave of troops on 19 February. Close air support, almost all of it derived from carriers, played a major role throughout the invasion.

===Sinking===

On 16 February, Vice-Admiral Kimpei Teroaka authorized the formation of a kamikaze special attack unit to counter the imminent landings on Iwo Jima. The kamikaze force consisted of thirty-two aircraft in total, and on the early morning of 21 February, they departed from Katori Naval Air Base, in Asahi, Chiba. They refueled at Hachijō-jima, and proceeded towards the U.S. naval contingent surrounding Iwo Jima, arriving near sunset.

When the kamikazes arrived, &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot; was performing routine close air support with the rest of Task Group 52.2. At the time, the escort carrier task group, having split in two, consisted of &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot;, her sister ships , , &quot;Saginaw Bay&quot;, , and , along with a destroyer contingent. The task group was steaming approximately east of Iwo Jima. At 17:30, the aircraft on &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot; were scrambled to deal with incoming planes, which turned out to be friendly. After recovering her planes, she found it necessary to take on three planes from other carriers and, due to the lack of deck space, to shelter four of her fighters below-decks without emptying their fuel tanks, a decision which would later prove disastrous. This brought the number of aircraft aboard the carrier to thirty-seven aircraft: 19 FM-2 fighters, 15 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, 2 OY-1 reconnaissance aircraft, and a F6F Hellcat fighter. At 18:45, the task group spotted the Japanese planes headed for them, when a Mitsubishi G4M made a dive towards &quot;Lunga Point&quot;. Gunners from &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot; shot it down. At 18:46, five Nakajima B6Ns dove towards &quot;Lunga Point&quot;. All four of the kamikazes missed with their torpedoes, and none of them made successful contact with &quot;Lunga Point&quot;, albeit the third kamikaze&#x27;s wreckage skidded across the carrier&#x27;s deck, sparking a brief gasoline fire. Damage to &quot;Lunga Point&quot; was minimal, and eleven of her crew were wounded. There were no fatalities, and she was able to continue operating in support of troops on Iwo Jima.

The fifth plane, however, switched targets, and proceeded towards &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot;. At , it was spotted by, and engaged by gunners aboard &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot;. However, despite the heavy gunfire, which damaged the plane, it quickly approached &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot; from the starboard side at a low angle, which the anti-aircraft guns could not depress sufficiently to fire at. The plane plowed in under the first 40 mm gun (aft), crashing through the hangar deck and striking the ship&#x27;s magazines. At the time of the crash, the aircraft elevator was in operation, and nearly up to the flight deck, when its cables were cut by the kamikaze, causing the platform to drop onto the hangar deck with a tremendous amount of force. The force of the explosion distributed munitions, including torpedoes, across the deck, and started a fire. The ship&#x27;s steering was also rendered dysfunctional by the blast. The sprinkler system and the water curtains were inoperative, but the fire was nearly under control when about two minutes later, a second plane, likely attracted by the ship&#x27;s glow against the darkness, approaching from the port side, struck the aft elevator shaft, exploding on impact, killing the majority of the fire-fighting party and destroying the fire fighting salt-water distribution system, thus preventing any further damage control. The second plane detonated amongst the four fighters which were sheltered belowdecks, and the fighters, with full gasoline tanks, quickly turned the fire into a conflagration, enveloping the entire aft side of the ship.

When munitions on board the ship began to detonate, and with no firefighting equipment operational, the situation quickly deteriorated. At 19:00, the crew assembled at their &quot;abandon ship&quot; locations, and the engines were cut. Captain John L. Pratt issued the order to abandon ship at 19:05. As the crew abandoned ship, a large explosion, likely from the detonation of the torpedoes within the hangar deck, rocked the ship. This explosion tore much of the aft-end of the ship to shreds, and she quickly acquired a list to the starboard. Twenty Wildcats and eleven Avengers went down with &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot;. The majority of the crew made it off the ship in the next 30 minutes. At 20:07, the ship&#x27;s island detached from the hull and slid into the water. Two hours after the dual kamikaze attacks, at 21:15, &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot; sank with the loss of 318 men, and was the last US Navy aircraft carrier to be lost during World War II. Many casualties were inflicted once the crew abandoned ship, through hypothermia, choppy seas, and Japanese aircraft strafing the survivors. Three destroyers and three destroyer escorts rescued survivors over the next 12 hours, between them saving a total of 605 officers and men from her crew of 923. The destroyer escort directed the rescue operations of the remaining hands, in spite of darkness, heavy seas and continuing air attacks, rescuing a majority of the surviving crew. Thirty of &quot;Edmonds&quot;″ own crew went over the side to bring the wounded and exhausted carrier men to safety. &quot;Edmonds&quot; hauled up 378 men, the destroyer escort retrieved 136 men, and the destroyer recovered 39 survivors. Survivors were then transferred to the attack transports and .

The special attack unit which struck on 21 February, in addition to sinking &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot;, also heavily damaged , , and slightly damaged &quot;Lunga Point&quot;, , and . &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot; was the only ship to sink as a result of the attacks and was struck from the Navy List on 30 March; to date, she is the last US aircraft carrier lost due to enemy action. The kamikaze attacks killed 43 Japanese in total.

<text>USS &quot;Kwajalein&quot; (CVE-98) was the forty-fourth of fifty s built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was named after the Battle of Kwajalein, in which American forces captured Kwajalein Atoll. The ship was launched in May 1944, commissioned in June, and served in support of the Philippines campaign. Later in the war, she served as a replenishment carrier, during which she was damaged by Typhoon Cobra. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet, repatriating U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She was decommissioned in May 1946, when she was mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in January 1961.

==Design and description==
&quot;Kwajalein&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, at the waterline, she was long, she had a beam of , at her widest point, this was , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installation of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20 mm cannons, and the amount of 40 mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Although &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to function with a crew of 860 and an embarked squadron of 50 to 56, the exigencies of wartime often necessitated the inflation of the crew count. In a combat situation, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but an additional number could be accommodated on the hangar deck.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington, under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942. The escort carrier was laid down on 19 February 1944 under the name &quot;Bucareli Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was later renamed &quot;Kwajalein&quot;, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers after naval or land engagements. The escort carrier was laid down as MC hull 1135, the forty-fourth of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. She was launched on 4 May 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Rudolf L. Johnson; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 7 June 1944.

==Service history==

After commissioning, &quot;Kwajalein&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Pedro. She then underwent a transport mission on 19 July to Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides, ferrying military passengers and aircraft. She arrived on 3 August, and proceeded westwards on 7 August for Guam in the Mariana Islands, transporting additional aircraft. There, she took on a load of salvaged Japanese equipment, which she carried back to the United States for analysis.

Arriving at the West Coast, she underwent repairs and overhaul at San Diego. She was then assigned to replenishment carrier duties, departing on 7 October to support the Third Fleet&#x27;s frontline Fast Carrier Task Force as part of Task Group 30.8, the Fleet Oiler and Transport Carrier Group. Replenishment escort carriers such as &quot;Kwajalein&quot; enabled the frontline carriers to replace battle losses and to stay at sea for longer durations of time. She took on a load of replacement aircraft at Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands, and sailed for Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 5 November, where she rendezvoused with the replenishment carrier fleet. She was stationed off Manus and Ulithi in the Caroline Islands, where she received supplies and replacement aircraft. Her aircraft were sent to support U.S. forces in the Philippines campaign. During these duties, on 18 December, as part of Task Group 30.8.14, she weathered Typhoon Cobra.

The Third Fleet had been operating against positions on Luzon since 14 December, but its escorting destroyers ran low on fuel. As a result, the fleet retired to the east to refuel and to receive replacement aircraft from Task Group 30.8. She rendezvoused with the Third Fleet about east of Luzon early on 17 December. The location had been chosen because it lay out of range of Japanese fighters, but it also happened to lie within Typhoon Alley, where many Pacific tropical cyclones transited. As the escort carriers and the Third Fleet met, Typhoon Cobra began to bear down. At 01:00 on 18 December, fueling operations were attempted with the destroyers, although heavy winds and listing seas complicated the matter. At the same time, barometers on-board the ships began to drop, and tropical storm force winds were recorded. Some preparations were made onboard &quot;Kwajalein&quot;, with the aircraft on her flight deck being lashed down to prevent their loss.

As the weather continued to deteriorate, Admiral William Halsey Jr. ordered fueling operations suspended at 13:10. In a clumsy attempt to evade the cyclone, and misled by sketchy data, Halsey ordered several conflicting orders in quick succession, which ultimately brought &quot;Kwajalein&quot; and the rest of the escort carriers into the quadrant of the typhoon with the strongest winds.

At 07:00, the fleet was inescapably trapped in the typhoon&#x27;s path. Conflicting orders meant that some of the destroyers attempted to do some fueling during the morning, even as waves with an estimated height of pounded the task force. At 07:22, &quot;Kwajalein&quot; came to course at 60°, along with her sisters and . At 09:40, she lost most steering control, but careful manipulation of the rudder meant that &quot;Kwajalein&quot; only faced rolls of about 10°, and at the time, she fared much better than many of her fellow replenishment carriers. However, with visibility down to only , each ship moving independently of each other, and the ship&#x27;s lack of steering control, the ship&#x27;s officers were gravely concerned about potential collisions.

Eventually, as she proceeded deeper into the typhoon&#x27;s eyewall, her roll began to increase drastically. At one point, Warrick reported that she had rolled 39° to port, a very dangerous angle. At 13:00, a Grumman F6F Hellcat fighter broke free of its restraints, and rolled across the flight deck into a gun mount. Several crewmen, at great personal risk, shoved the plane overboard before it could wreak any more damage. During the height of the storm, two more planes were jettisoned off her flight deck, with two more damaged and rendered inoperational. However, the majority of her aircraft remained intact and usable, in stark contrast to some of the other escort carriers who went through the typhoon, which had almost their entire aircraft contingent ejected or damaged beyond repair. Only minor damage was dealt to &quot;Kwajalein&quot;, and she was able to continue operating as a replenishment carrier.

Later, in January 1945, she transitioned northwards, providing replacement aircraft in support of the Fast Carrier Task Force, which was operating against Japanese bases along the Formosan and Chinese coasts. Upon completing her duties, she was discharged from the replenishment carrier fleet, steaming back to the United States. She returned on San Diego on 23 February, where she underwent overhaul, and received a load of aircraft.

After completing her overhaul, she proceeded to Pearl Harbor with her load of aircraft. There, she served as a transport carrier until the cession of hostilities with Japan. She conducted three transport runs from Hawaii to bases in the West Pacific, ferrying aircraft, supplies, and munitions. The aircraft she transported helped replace losses sustained in raids against the Japanese home islands. During these transport runs, Captain Charles Murray Heberton took over command of the vessel on 15 July 1945.

After news of the Japanese surrender broke, she joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. In total, she made four Magic Carpet runs, making stops throughout the Pacific. She arrived at San Pedro on 2 February 1946, whereupon she was discharged from the Magic Carpet fleet. On 23 April, she departed San Pedro, and sailed north for Mukilteo, Washington, arriving there on 5 February. She then proceeded to Pacific Reserve Fleet, Tacoma in Tacoma, Washington, where inactivation work was conducted. She was decommissioned on 16 August, and mothballed as part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She was redesignated as a utility aircraft carrier, CVU-98, on 12 June 1955. She was once again redesignated, this time as an aircraft transport, AKV-34, on 7 May 1959. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 April 1960, and sold for scrapping. She was ultimately broken up in Japan sometime in 1961. She received two battle stars for her World War II service.

<doc id="522795" wikidata="Q7870216" url="?curid=522795" title="USS Hollandia">
<text>USS &quot;Hollandia&quot; (CVE-97) was a of the United States Navy. She was named after the Battle of Hollandia, a successful amphibious operation during the New Guinea campaign. Launched in April 1944, and commissioned in June, she served in support of the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in January 1947, when she was mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrap in December 1960.

==Design and description==
&quot;Hollandia&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carrier ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate the movement of aircraft between the flight deck and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by 8 Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20–mm cannons, and the amount of 40–mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more.

==Construction==
The escort carrier was laid down on 12 February 1944, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1134, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was laid down and launched under the name &quot;Astrolabe Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was renamed &quot;Hollandia&quot; on 30 May 1944, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers after naval or land engagements. She was launched on 28 April 1944; sponsored by Mrs. William H. Wheat; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 1 June 1944, with Captain Charles Loomis Lee in command.

==Service history==


Upon being commissioned, &quot;Hollandia&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego. Shakedown continued as she underwent a transport mission, carrying a load of replacement aircraft and military personnel. She departed on 10 July, bound for Espiritu Santo. On her return trip, she stopped at Manus and Guadalcanal, before arriving at Port Hueneme, California on 27 August. For the next few months, &quot;Hollandia&quot; continued these transport missions to the West and South Pacific, transporting supplies and passengers.

She continued these duties until 1 April 1945, at which point she was anchored at Ulithi. As U.S. forces began their landings, beginning the Battle of Okinawa, &quot;Hollandia&quot; joined the Special Escort Carrier Group as its flagship. She, along with , , and the
 , transported Marine Air Groups 31 and 33 to land bases captured on Okinawa. In total, the air group being transported consisted of 192 Vought F4U Corsair and 30 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters. &quot;Hollandia&quot; was delegated to take on the planes of Marine Air Group 33. After departing on 2 April, the destroyers , , , and provided a screen for the carriers.

The escort carriers managed to safely arrive at Okinawa on 6 April, although the destroyers dropped depth charges to deter a suspected submarine en route. There, &quot;Hollandia&quot; prepared to begin launching her aircraft, which would be the first land-based aircraft to support the U.S. forces fighting their way down the island. However, she, along with &quot;White Plains&quot;, were ordered to postpone their launchings for several days, as the transport ships ferrying the equipment of the marines had been attacked and damaged, with much equipment lost. On 9 April, she launched her planes to the hastily expanded Kadena Air Base, where the aircraft began operations. Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 323, transported aboard the escort carriers, would go on to become the highest-scoring air unit participating in the Battle of Okinawa, claiming 124.5 Japanese planes.

Having completed her duties, she returned to San Diego, arriving on 1 May. Whilst at port, Captain John Thompson Brown, Jr. took over command of the vessel. She then conducted a transport run to Pearl Harbor, ferrying cargo and passengers. On 7 June, she departed the West Coast to serve as a replenishment carrier, supporting the Fast Carrier Task Force in its operations against Japan. Replenishment carriers enabled the frontline carriers to replace battle losses, and to stay at sea for longer durations of time. &quot;Hollandia&quot; loaded replacement aircraft at Pearl Harbor, and she sailed on 18 June to join Task Group 30.8, the Fleet Oiler and Transport Carrier Group (also known as the At Sea Logistics Service Group). She provided replacement aircraft up until news of the Japanese surrender broke.

Post-war, &quot;Hollandia&quot; berthed at Guam, where an overhaul was conducted to transform her into a passenger ship. She then joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. She conducted four Magic Carpet runs, before heading to San Pedro, where she was released from the Magic Carpet fleet. She departed Southern California on 4 February 1946, bound for Puget Sound, and upon arriving on 15 February, she underwent inactivation. The ship was decommissioned on 17 January 1947, and mothballed as part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Whilst mothballed, she was redesignated as a utility aircraft carrier, CVU-97, on 12 June 1955. The hull was then once again redesignated, this time as an aircraft transport, AKV-33, on 7 May 1959. Finally, her hull was struck from the Navy list on 1 April 1960, and sold sometime in July 1960 to Eisenberg &amp; Co. of New York for scrapping. Her ultimate fate was to be broken up in Japan during November 1960.

<doc id="522798" wikidata="Q369884" url="?curid=522798" title="USS Makin Island (CVE-93)">
<text>USS &quot;Makin Island&quot; (CVE-93) was a of the United States Navy. It was named for the 1942 Makin raid, an early diversionary raid designed to distract from the Guadalcanal campaign and the Tulagi campaign. Launched in April 1944, and commissioned in May, she served in support of the Philippines campaign, the Invasion of Iwo Jima, and the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in April 1946, and ultimately sold for scrapping in January 1947.

==Design and description==
&quot;Makin Island&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , an extreme width of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck, a long flight deck. She was powered with two Uniflow reciprocating steam engines, which provided a force of , driving two shafts, enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of , assuming that she traveled at a constant speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow end, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one on the fore, another on the aft.

One /38-caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern, and she was equipped with 16 Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft (AA) guns in twin mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons, which were used in an anti-aircraft capability. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20 mm cannons, as a response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Anti-aircraft guns were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but she sometimes went over or under this number. For example, during the Philippines campaign, she carried 15 FM-2 fighters, 9 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, and a TBM-3P photo reconnaissance plane, for a total of 25 aircraft. However, during the Invasion of Iwo Jima, she carried 20 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 32 aircraft. During the Battle of Okinawa, she carried 16 FM-2 fighters and 11 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 27 aircraft.

==Construction==
The escort carrier was laid down on 12 January 1944 under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1130, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was launched on 5 April 1944; sponsored by Mrs. B. B. Nichol; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 9 May 1944 with a partial crew complement of 60 officers and 560 crewmen.

==Service history==
Following commissioning, she underwent outfitting at Astoria, Oregon. On 31 May, she left, bound for Puget Sound, where munitions were loaded, and tests were conducted. On 8 June, she departed, traveling down to Naval Base San Diego, stopping at Naval Air Station Alameda to load more munitions and to refuel. Upon arriving in San Diego, she underwent a brief shakedown cruise, engaging in exercises off of Baja California. On 19 June, she set off on a transport mission, ferrying 78 aircraft and 236 men to Hawaii. After unloading her cargo in Pearl Harbor, she took on 70 aircraft, along with a marine squadron (VMO-155). She then proceeded onwards to Majuro Atoll, where she unloaded her planes. After leaving, she made stops at Kwajalein Atoll and Roi-Namur, where she took on wounded from the ongoing Battle of Saipan. She then returned to Pearl Harbor, where she loaded onboard Air Group 16, which had been recently detached from . After returning her aircraft cargo to San Diego, she sailed to Long Beach Naval Shipyard, where she underwent overhaul.

After finishing overhaul, she took on her aircraft contingent (VC-84), and on 16 August, she began exercises along the California coast. Exercises concluded on 5 September, with minor repairs being conducted until 11 September, when she sortied again for more exercises. She was assigned as part of Carrier Division 29, along with , , and . The task group engaged in simulated amphibious landings on San Clemente Island. On 10 October, Rear Admiral Calvin T. Durgin took control over the escort carrier group, making &quot;Makin Island&quot; as his flagship. On 16 October, her task group finished exercises, and traveled to the Ulithi Atoll, making stops at Pearl Harbor and Enewetak Atoll.

On 10 November, the ship got underway for Leyte, stopping at Kossol Roads. There, she protected convoys in transit to supply the ongoing Battle of Leyte. Notably, on 21 November, she opened fire on three Nakajima J1N &quot;Irving&quot; twin-engined bombers who flew near the carrier, albeit the aircraft did not engage, and escaped. On 23 November, she was relieved by Carrier Division 27, and the task group sailed to Manus for the forthcoming invasion of Luzon. On 27 November, she arrived at Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island, where supplies were loaded and preparations were made. Between 16 December and 20 December, she left port to engage in exercises with Huon Gulf.

She left Manus island on 27 December, and she rendezvoused with the invasion force in Surigao Strait, Leyte on 3 January 1945. The fleet assembled for the invasion of Luzon was immense, consisting of 18 escort carriers, 6 battleships, 4 heavy cruisers, and a multitude of destroyers and destroyer escorts. Almost immediately, the massive fleet was continuously harassed by Japanese kamikaze attacks. On the night of 3 January, a Mitsubishi A6M Zero &quot;Zeke&quot; dove on the escort carriers, plunging into the ocean approximately from the starboard of &quot;Makin Island&quot;. On the afternoon of 4 January, the task force once again came under kamikaze attacks, which sunk . On the early morning of 5 January, a Japanese plane flew a scant over the carrier. Later that day, her aircraft supplemented a strike force which sunk and heavily damaged . That same day, in the evening, kamikazes damaged , , and . &quot;Makin Island&quot; arrived unscathed near Luzon on 6 January. For the next 11 days, she remained off of Luzon flying air support for the amphibious operation. Notably, &quot;Salamaua&quot; was heavily damaged by a kamikaze on 13 January. On 17 January, the escort carriers withdrew, heading back to Ulithi. During the three-week operation, the only fatality onboard &quot;Makin Island&quot; was a sailor on the flight deck, who died when a 3.5-inch rocket on an Avenger accidentally discharged, launching him off the carrier. A resulting search proved unsuccessful. This was despite the fact 16 of her own aircraft were destroyed through anti-aircraft fire and accidents. Her air group destroyed 10 Japanese aircraft, and her anti-aircraft guns claimed a kamikaze heading towards the task force.

After the Battle of Luzon, the aircraft carriers only had 18 days to prepare for the Invasion of Iwo Jima. On 10 February, she departed Ulithi for Iwo Jima, where she arrived on 16 February 1945. Her escort carrier task group conducted 3,000 sorties over the Iwo Islands until 8 March, conducting aerial reconnaissance, providing close air support, creating a fighter cover, and patrolling against submarines. On 28 February, her fighters were even used to spray down the island with DDT to control a boom in the population of flies on the island. Notably, her fighters intercepted two Japanese troop transports carrying reinforcements to Iwo Jima, which were promptly strafed and sunk. The carrier group yet again came under heavy Japanese kamikaze attacks, but &quot;Makin Island&quot; was once again unscathed, although was sunk, and heavily damaged. Despite the intense air support, the only casualty onboard &quot;Makin Island&quot; was a wounded airman. After replenishing at Ulithi, she sailed for Okinawa, again as flagship. On 8 March, she retired to Ulithi in preparations for the Battle of Okinawa.

Arriving at Ulithi on 11 March, the ship was quickly readied, and launched for Okinawa on 21 March. Arriving on 25 March, &quot;Makin Island&quot; remained on station for 77 days (69 days directly off the coast of Okinawa), flying constant fire support, supply, and reconnaissance missions for the ground forces. The ship&#x27;s aircraft, from Composite Squadrons 84 and 91 (VC-84 and -91), flew 2,347 combat sorties, recording almost 8,000 hours of flying time. Relieved 1 June, the carrier sailed for Guam, arriving on 5 June. Whilst in availability on Guam, Vice Admiral Ira Earl Hobbs relieved now Rear Admiral Whaley from command. In addition, her aircraft contingent was rotated, with VC-41 being transferred onto the ship.

She sailed again 11 July, with Task Group 32.1, into the East China Sea. The task group&#x27;s goal was to provide air cover for minesweepers operating in the area, to blockade Japanese troops within China from mainland Japan, to provide air cover for a fast cruiser group which was raiding the Chinese coast, and to attack shipping around Shanghai. Upon a sweep of the Chinese coast, in which the task group encountered minimal resistance, and after a brief bombing of Shanghai harbor, she anchored in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 13 August. There, she received news of the Japanese surrender, and on 9 September proceeded to Wakanoura Wan, in southern Honshū, for occupation duty. Among her missions was providing air cover for the evacuation of Allied prisoners of war. She sailed for San Francisco on 18 October, arriving on 5 November, then voyaged to Shanghai to return troops (including the famous Flying Tigers) to the United States at Seattle on 30 December.

&quot;Makin Island&quot; was decommissioned on 19 April 1946 at Puget Sound, was stricken from the Navy list on 11 July, and sold on 1 January 1947.

<text>USS &quot;Makassar Strait&quot; (CVE-91) was a of the United States Navy. She was named after the Battle of Makassar Strait, an early naval engagement to the east of Borneo. Launched in March 1944, and commissioned in April, she served in support of the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in August 1946, when she was mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was used as a target, and she was accidentally run aground on San Nicolas Island in April 1961. Her wreckage survived until at least 1965.

==Design and description==
&quot;Makassar Strait&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carrier ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by 8 Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20–mm cannons, and the amount of 40–mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. For example, during the Battle of Okinawa, she carried 16 FM-2 fighters, and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 28 aircraft.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942, under the name &quot;Ulitaka Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was renamed &quot;Makassar Strait&quot; on 6 November 1943, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent Casablanca-class carriers after naval or land engagements. The escort carrier was laid down on 29 December 1943, MC hull 1128, the thirty-sixth of a series of fifty Casablanca-class escort carriers. She was launched on 22 March 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Truman J. Hedding; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 27 April 1944, with Captain Warren Kenneth Berner in command.

==Service history==

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Makassar Strait&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego. On 6 June, she departed San Diego, transporting aircraft and passengers to the Marshall Islands, making a stop at Pearl Harbor along the way. On her return trip, she loaded military wounded, and ferried them back to the West Coast, arriving back at Southern California on 13 July. She spent the next two months as a training carrier, conducting pilot qualifications off Southern California. On 25 September, she left for another transport mission, ferrying 129 aircraft to Hawaii and the Admiralty Islands. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 October, with a load of damaged fighters, where she resumed training operations.

For the next three months, until the new year, she served yet again as a training carrier in the waters surrounding Hawaii, hosting a dozen different air groups on her deck. Captain Herbert D. Riley assumed command on January 10, 1945. About 6,700 landings were made on her flight deck, as she conducted various types of exercises. After loading her permanent aircraft contingent, Composite Squadron 97 (VC-97), she departed Pearl Harbor on 29 January 1945, and was assigned to Task Group 50.8 (Logistics Support Group). She stopped at Enewetak Atoll, before assuming her role protecting convoys supporting the frontline Fast Carrier Task Force. She also provided air screens for the transfer of replacement aircraft to their carriers.

She was assigned to a support carrier group on 8 April, and began conducting operations with the main strike group of Task Group 52.1. She consequently began combat operations over Okinawa in support of the ongoing battle. For the next four weeks, she provided close air support and bombed Japanese defenses as the marines struggled to fight their way south. During these operations, her fighters shot down four Japanese aircraft. She ceased operations over Okinawa on 7 May, when she transferred her aircraft contingent to at Kerama Retto, which was to serve as her replacement.

After retiring from Okinawa, she arrived at Guam on 11 May. She then operated as a training carrier in the vicinity of the Mariana Islands, providing refresher training for pilots. She finished her duties and left for Hawaii on 19 July, making a stop at Kwajalein Atoll, where she loaded fifty aircraft. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 29 July, where she took on 387 passengers. She then proceeded, on 14 August, to sail for the West Coast. She arrived at San Diego on 21 August, and served, yet again, as a training carrier off the Southern California coast until well past the Japanese surrender. By the end of October, there had been over 15,500 recorded landings on her flight deck.

On 4 November, she left San Diego, and joined the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She sailed for Pearl Harbor, where she shipped troops to the Marshall Islands. She then stopped at Kwajalein, where she took on 1,092 veterans, and sailed back to the West Coast, arriving at San Diego on 29 November. On 4 December, she left for Guam, returning on 3 January 1946, repatriating a further 1,123 veterans back to the United States. She departed San Diego on 5 January, heading to Tacoma, Washington, making a stop at San Francisco. Upon arriving on 12 January, she was mothballed with the 19th Fleet, which would later become known as the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

She was declassified and decommissioned on 9 August 1946. She was reclassified as CVU-91 on 12 June 1955. On 28 August 1958, she was authorized to be used as a target and destroyed, and she was struck from the Navy list on 1 September 1958. During the next three years, she was used by the navy to gather data on the use of surface-launched missiles. During April 1961, while under tow to San Clemente Island off Southern California, she accidentally ran aground on San Nicholas Island in the Channel Islands. The Navy then sold her for breaking &quot;in situ&quot; on 2 May 1961. However, she was not scrapped, partially due to her less than optimal position. In 1965, it was known that she had not yet been broken up and was still being used as a target by the navy. Notably, by then, the entire escort carrier had since been split in half by the grounding.

<text>USS &quot;Salamaua&quot; (CVE-96) was a of the United States Navy. She was named after the invasion of Salamaua, a strategically important village in the New Guinea Theater during World War II, and one of the main targets of the Salamaua–Lae campaign. She served with distinction during the war, notably being damaged in early 1945 by a kamikaze aircraft during the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, killing 15 crewmen and injuring 88. Post war, the ship helped repatriate servicemen to the United States as part of Operation Magic Carpet before being decommissioned and struck in 1946, and ultimately being broken up in 1947.

==Design and description==

&quot;Salamaua&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Fifty of these escort carriers were built, making them the most numerous type of aircraft carrier ever built. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced normally, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck, a long flight deck. She was powered with two Uniflow reciprocating steam engines, which provided , driving two shafts, enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of , assuming that she traveled at a constant speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow end, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one on the fore, another on the aft.

One /38 caliber dual purpose gun was mounted on the stern, and she was equipped with sixteen Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were used in an anti-aircraft capability. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry 30 20–mm cannons, as a response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Anti-aircraft guns were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but they sometimes went over or under this number. For example, during the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, &quot;Salamaua&quot; carried 14 FM-2 fighters and 10 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 24 aircraft. However, during &quot;Salamaua&quot;″s anti-submarine sweeps in the closing stages of the war, she carried 18 FM-2 fighters, 2 FM-2P variant fighters, and 12 TBM-3E variant torpedo bombers, for a total of 32 aircraft. While she was transporting aircraft in a non-combat role, she could accommodate up to 50 aircraft, provided her flight deck was also used for storage.

==Construction==
The escort carrier was laid down on 4 February 1944, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1133, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. When she was ordered in 1942, she was expected to possess the name &quot;Anguilla Bay&quot;, as part of the US Navy&#x27;s policy of naming escort carriers after bays and sounds. On 6 November 1943, before she was laid down, she was renamed to &quot;Salamaua&quot;, as part of a new policy which named escort carriers after sites of naval or land engagements. She was launched on 22 April 1944; sponsored by Mrs. W. J. Mullins; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 26 May 1944, Captain Joseph Irwin Taylor, Jr in command, and with a partial complement of 54 officers and 518 enlisted men.

==Service history==
Following her commission, she proceeded through the Strait of Juan de Fuca on 17 June 1944, taking on armaments and conducting tests at Naval Station Bremerton from 18 June to 22 June. On 22 June, she arrived at Seattle, Washington, where she took on a load of damaged aircraft, bound for San Diego. As she proceeded down the West Coast, she underwent shakedown, pausing at the naval supply depot in Oakland. She arrived at San Diego, on 29 June, where she unloaded her aircraft. She then conducted drills off the coast of Baja California, for four days, returning to San Diego, on 4 July, where she took on an aircraft contingent and cargo. &quot;Salamaua&quot; left San Diego, on 6 July, arriving at Pearl Harbor, on 12 July, where she unloaded her wares for the next four days. She left Pearl Harbor, on 16 July, arriving at Naval Air Station Alameda, on 22 July, where she took on 50 aircraft and 300 passengers, bound for Finschhafen, New Guinea.

&quot;Salamaua&quot; departed Alameda, California, on the morning of 24 July, passing south of Hawaii, on 29 July, arriving at Finschhafen, on 12 August, where she took on a load of nonfunctional aircraft. She departed New Guinea, on 14 August, stopping at Palikulo Bay, to take on fuel. On 1 September, she returned to Alameda, where she underwent overhaul and conducted training exercises. She departed on 3 September, transporting cargo to San Diego, where she arrived on 4 September. On 26 September, she received her combat aircraft contingent (VC-87) at Naval Base San Diego. On 30 September, she left San Diego with to conduct flight exercises, returning on 7 October.

On 16 October, she once again sailed west from San Diego, as part of Task Unit 19.15.1, under the command of Rear Admiral Calvin T. Durgin, along with her fellow sister ships , , and . She paused at Pearl Harbor on 23 October, and arrived at Ulithi on 5 November. A tropical disturbance delayed departure until 10 November, when she set off for Leyte Gulf, pausing at Kossol Roads, to replenish fuel. She departed on 13 November, and from 14 November to 23 November, she furnished air screening for convoys in the Leyte Gulf area, without major incident. On 23 November, a Mitsubishi G4M bomber managed to get through the screen, strafing the carriers without much ill effect before being shot down. She then proceeded to the Admiralty Islands, to prepare for the invasion of Luzon, as part of Carrier Division 29, under the command of Rear Admiral Durgin. En route, the destroyers and detected a potential submarine on 26 November, and dropped depth charges. She, along with her task group, arrived at Seeadler Harbor on 27 November. She stayed at anchor until 16 December, when she left to engage in training exercises at Huon Gulf. On 21 December, she returned to Seeadler Harbor, to make final preparations for the planned invasion of Lingayen Gulf.

===Lingayen Gulf===
She departed Seeadler Harbor, on the afternoon of 27 December, and moved north to a massive escort carrier formation at Kossol Roads, on 30 December. On 1 January 1945, the task group left for Luzon, passing Leyte, on 3 January. The following day, 4 January 1945, her task group was engaged by kamikazes. On the afternoon of 4 January 1945, she was transiting the Sulu Sea, to the west of the Philippines. At 17:00, approximately 15 Japanese planes were picked up on radar, west of the task group, and approaching quickly. These planes split into two groups, one group heading towards the rear of the task group, whilst the other continued on its course towards the center. Although fighters from the carrier group were scrambled, false radar signals hampered their efforts to intercept, resulting in the shooting down of just one Japanese plane. During the early stages of the attack, one kamikaze made for &quot;Salamaua&quot;, but it was discouraged by heavy anti-aircraft fire, changing course instead to make for &quot;Lunga Point&quot; before being shot down. Later that day, she witnessed the sinking of , which was scuttled following a devastating kamikaze strike.

On 5 January, her task group was harried by more kamikazes, and two planes were shot down by &quot;Salamaua&quot;″s anti-aircraft gunners. The kamikazes did succeed in damaging the cruiser , however. On 6 January, she arrived off the entrance to Lingayen Gulf. Her planes began blasting enemy positions ashore and providing air cover for the approaching Allied ships. On 9 January, they provided air cover for the troops landing on the assault beaches, then continued that support until 13 January, when she was forced to retire.

In the days prior to 13 January, fueling operations for the task group had been underway, which was complicated significantly by rough seas which snapped hoses. On 13 January 1945, the task group relocated to the west of Lingayen Gulf, where fueling recommenced. At 09:00 in the morning, &quot;Salamaua&quot; was scheduled to be refueled by an oiler. The task group had launched combat air patrols to screen the carriers, with one group of aircraft at and another at . However, visibility was limited due to heavy cloud cover, hovering above the ground, and there was no indication of enemy activity in the area.

At 08:58, a Japanese kamikaze plane, emerging from cloud cover, unexpectedly dove almost vertically towards &quot;Salamaua&quot;″s flight deck. The speed of its descent, as well as the task group being on low alert, meant that the kamikaze was able to carry out its attack unmolested by anti-aircraft fire. Carrying two bombs, it penetrated deep into the lower decks, leaving a by gaping hole in the flight deck and lighting a fire in the lower bulkheads that caused a pillar of smoke to rise from the hole. Admiral Durgin, querying &quot;Salamaua&quot; as to the origin of the smoke, received a reply that &quot;Something just went through our flight deck&quot;. One of the bombs detonated near the tank tops, just above the bilge, narrowly missing the bomb stowage compartment. The blast sent debris from the engine and fuselage rocketing onto the flight deck, collapsing a number of bulkheads. Additionally, it sparked multiple fires throughout the flight deck, hangar deck, and engine room. Inside the hangar deck, aircraft were being readied for a strike, and the existence of armed munitions made the situation tenuous. The second bomb failed to explode, and was ejected through the starboard side of the ship at the waterline, near the engine, leaving a hole about wide through which seawater rushed in. There was immediate loss of power, communications, and steering throughout the ship. The aft engine room was breached and flooded, rendering the starboard engine inoperational, albeit the flooding extinguished the engine room blaze.

Several fires were kindled, but most of the blazes were quickly put under control, with the exception of a major fire within the hangar deck, which was fed by gasoline saturated debris from the flight deck. Fighting the fire was further complicated by the loss of water main pressure along the aft of the ship, and by the detonation of hydrostatic fuses and various other ammunition. After 30 minutes, the blaze was contained, after a fight which first belayed, then prevented the detonation of more munitions. A more pressing concern was flooding, which an entire day of pumping could not alleviate. This resulted in the entire starboard engine being submerged, leading to the ship acquiring an 8° list to the starboard. The attack on &quot;Salamaua&quot; was the last successful kamikaze attack in the Philippines Campaign.

There were more kamikazes which followed up in the 10 minutes after the attack on &quot;Salamaua&quot;, but the Japanese had lost the element of surprise. One plane dove towards , but was engaged by heavy anti-aircraft fire, including from &quot;Salamaua&quot;, and it veered towards before being destroyed by a proximity-fuzed 5-inch shell. Another two planes tried to strike &quot;Salamaua&quot;, one passing above her port quarter before crashing into the sea, and another one detonating in midair as it approached her astern. Throughout this ordeal, she was able to keep up with her task group using her port engine. Fifteen men were killed, and 88 injured by the attack. At 19:25, she broke away from her task group to limp away for Leyte, accompanied by the destroyers and , along with the tug .

===Okinawa===
&quot;Salamaua&quot; limped into Leyte, still hampered significantly by flooding, on 14 January. There, injured were unloaded, the worst of the wreckage was cleaned up, and flooding was partially controlled. After repairs, she set off for Seeadler Harbor, arriving on 2 February, for repairs on floating dry dock, where her aircraft contingent and crew were disembarked. On 5 February, she left for Pearl Harbor, accompanied by , also damaged by a kamikaze. She arrived on 17 February, where she unloaded unnecessary ammunition, and departed on 19 February, bound for San Francisco.

Arriving on 26 February, she was put in a queue for repairs. Repairs began on 3 March, and on 21 April, she moved west again. She arrived back at Pearl Harbor on 27 April, and received her new aircraft contingent (VC-70). She then conducted training exercises, in conjunction with . She concluded her exercises and returned on 4 May, and set off for Guam, on 10 May, arriving on 20 May. At Guam, she received orders to join Task Group 52.2.1., which was supporting operations on the Ryukyu Islands. She rendezvoused with the task group on 26 May, to support land operations on Okinawa, but on 3 June, she was ordered to join Task Group 30.8, a logistics support group, alongside , , and .

===Typhoon and anti-submarine operations===
She arrived at her post on 4 June, but the next day, Typhoon Connie passed directly over the Third Fleet. On the morning of 5 June, the task group was refueling, but the weather deteriorated to render it impossible by noon. Reports of a typhoon to the south led Captain Joseph I. Taylor to order as many aircraft as possible to be sheltered within the hangar bay. Her limited carrying capabilities forced some aircraft to be stored on the flight deck, where they were bolted down onto the tarmac. By late afternoon, the task group was being buffeted by tropical storm force winds, and at 3:30, 5 June, hurricane force winds were reported. Steering control was lost by 3:35, as massive waves pounded the ship. A fore 40–mm gun and the aircraft handling boom was carted away by the waves. The flight deck was partially detached at the extreme fore, damaging the aircraft catapult and some bulkheads. On the flight deck, an Avenger tore loose from its restraints, spinning wildly across, wrecking all of the aircraft anchored onto the flight deck and killing a crewman. By the time the task force emerged from the typhoon, 46 planes had been destroyed, mostly on &quot;Salamaua&quot; and &quot;Bougainville&quot;. &quot;Salamaua&quot;″s flight deck had been rendered inoperative, and she arrived at Guam, on 10 June, to undergo repairs.
Repairs were hastily made at Guam, and she arrived at Ulithi, on 18 July. On 21 July, she was assigned anti-submarine patrol duty as part of the newly formed Task Group 94.17, along with the destroyer escorts , , , and . Their objective was to protect the Marianas-Okinawa convoy lanes. On 31 July, she shifted to the Leyte-Okinawa lanes, as a reaction to the sinking of the destroyer escort and the cruiser by Japanese submarines. On 5 August, Captain Joseph I. Taylor relinquished command of &quot;Salamaua&quot;, being replaced by Captain John Hook Griffin. She undertook anti-submarine duties until the Japanese surrender on 15 August. Task Group 94.17 cleared naval mines, and achieved the likely destruction of two Japanese midget submarines, along with the possible destruction of another midget submarine.

===Post-war===
On 25 August, &quot;Salamaua&quot; returned to Leyte, replenished, then escorted a troop convoy on 27 August, containing the U.S. Eighth Army to Tokyo Bay. The convoy arrived on 2 September, and the escort carrier&#x27;s planes photographed the landing of the occupation troops at Yokohama, during the formal Japanese surrender aboard the battleship . After guarding a second convoy into Tokyo Bay, she joined the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; fleet, which embarked veterans for transport to the United States. She disembarked her first cargo of veterans at Alameda, on 3 October. Before the end of the year, &quot;Salamaua&quot; completed two more &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; runs.

In 1946, she was prepared for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 9 May 1946, struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 21 May, and subsequently sold to the Zidell Ship Dismantling Company, Portland, Oregon, for scrapping on 18 November 1946. Her hull was broken up sometime in 1947.

<doc id="522802" wikidata="Q4982817" url="?curid=522802" title="Buck Buchanan Award">
<text>The Buck Buchanan Award is awarded annually to the most outstanding defensive player in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA) of college football, and was first given in 1995 after the Walter Payton Award was designated solely for offensive players.

It was named in honor of Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive tackle Buck Buchanan (died 1992), who starred at Grambling State University. Buchanan was an All-American defensive lineman and the first overall pick in the 1963 American Football League (AFL) Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs.

Up until presentations for the 2014 season, the Payton and Buchanan Awards were awarded by The Sports Network. Since STATS LLC, now known as Stats Perform, acquired The Sports Network in February 2015, it has presented all of the major FCS awards. Through the 2011 season, the awards were presented the night before the NCAA Division I Football Championship, but the 2012 awards were presented on December 17, nearly three weeks before that season&#x27;s championship game.

==Winners==
== Awards won by school ==
This is a list of the colleges and universities who have had a player win a Buck Buchanan Award. Cal Poly (2004, 2005, 2006) is the only program with three winners. Appalachian State (1995–1996), Eastern Washington (2008, 2010), James Madison (2001, 2009), Montana (2007, 2019), Montana State (2012–2013), and Western Illinois (1998, 2000), are the only schools to win the award twice. Dexter Coakley of Appalachian State is the only player to win the award twice.
:^ Team is now a member of the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS).

<doc id="522804" wikidata="Q7874706" url="?curid=522804" title="USS Thetis Bay">
<text>USS &quot;Thetis Bay&quot; (CVE-90) was the thirty-sixth of fifty s built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was launched in March 1944, commissioned in April, and served as a transport carrier in the Pacific, as well as a replenishment carrier supporting the Allied bombardment of Tokyo and the Main Islands. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet, before being decommissioned in August 1946, being mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She was reactivated in July 1956, and converted to a helicopter transport carrier, serving in relief operations in Taiwan and Haiti. Ultimately, she was broken up in 1966, the last &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class hull to be scrapped.

==Design and description==

&quot;Thetis Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carrier ever built, and was designed specifically to be rapidly mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early-war losses. By the end of their production run, the time taken between laying down the hull and launching the ship had been cut down to nearly one month. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard and with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size limited the length of the flight deck and necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty cannons, and the amount of Bofors guns had been doubled to 16, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Although &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to function with a crew of 860 and an embarked squadron of 50 to 56, the exigencies of wartime often necessitated the inflation of the crew count. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more, which was often necessary during transport or especially training missions, due to the constant turnover of pilots and aircraft.

Following her conversion into a helicopter assault carrier, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard and with a full load, and could make at full speed. She had a designed complement of 900 crew and 938 troops, was armed with four twin anti-aircraft guns, and carried twenty helicopters.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington, under a United States Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942. The escort carrier was laid down on 22 December 1943 under the name &quot;Thetis Bay&quot;, located within Kuiu Island, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. The bay itself was named by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1928 after the United States Revenue Cutter Service cutter &quot;Thetis&quot;, which in turn was named after the sea nymph Thetis, the daughter of Nereus and the mother of Achilles in Greek mythology. She was laid down as MC hull 1127, the thirty-sixth of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. She therefore received the classification symbol CVE-90, indicating that she was the ninetieth escort carrier to be commissioned into the United States Navy. She was launched on 16 March 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Rico Botta, the wife of Captain Botta, the Assembly and Repair Officer overseeing Naval Air Station North Island; transferred to the Navy and commissioned on 12 April 1944, with Captain Donald Edmund Wilcox in command. Notably, actress Claudette Colbert&#x27;s husband, Joel Pressman, a lieutenant commander in the Medical Corps served as the first medical officer at the time of the commissioning.

==Service history==
===World War II===

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Thetis Bay&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego, California. Upon finishing, she was assigned to transport duty, and proceeded north towards San Pedro to take on a load of aircraft and passengers. She put out to sea on 5 June, stopped at Pearl Harbor on 11 June, and headed out, via Makin Island of the Gilberts Islands and Majuro of the Marshall Islands, to Kwajalein. There, she took on the 50th Engineer Combat Battalion of the United States Army, which she deposited back at Pearl Harbor on 5 July.
On 7 July, &quot;Thetis Bay&quot; got underway for Alameda ferrying 41 aircraft that required repairs. She steamed into port on 13 July, and after unloading her cargo, headed for Terminal Island, Los Angeles for a three-week overhaul. Finishing in August, she resumed transport duties on 11 August, delivering spare parts, replacement aircraft, and military passengers from the West Coast to bases in Hawaii and the Marshalls. After completing her first transport tour on 13 September, she made five more round-trip missions, spanning September 1944 to mid-April 1945, ferrying supplies from the United States to a variety of destinations in the Pacific, ranging from Pearl Harbor to Finschhafen, New Guinea. During this period, Captain Benjamin Eugene Moore Jr. raised his flag over the ship on 21 January 1945.

On 12 June, &quot;Thetis Bay&quot; steamed into Pearl Harbor carrying a load of aircraft, having departed from San Diego. There, she was assigned to become a replenishment carrier as a part of Task Group 50.8.4, the mobile replenishment group supporting the frontline Fast Carrier Task Force. Replenishment escort carriers such as &quot;Thetis Bay&quot; enabled the frontline carriers to replace battle losses, and to stay at sea for longer durations of time. She first headed to Apra Harbor in Guam of the Mariana Islands, arriving on 25 June. Then, she headed westwards, making her first rendezvous with the fast carriers on 12 July, when she transferred 40 of her replenishment aircraft. She returned to Guam on 22 July to take on more aircraft, before she departed on 24 July, making another rendezvous on 31 July. She then replenished at Guam, before heading out once again, resupplying the frontline carriers from 14 August to 8 September. As she began her replenishment mission, news broke of the Japanese surrender, and her replenishment aircraft were used to support the initial landings in the Occupation of Japan.

===Post-war===
Upon finishing her replenishment mission, &quot;Thetis Bay&quot; returned to the United States via Guam, arriving at Alameda on 7 September. There, she joined the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She cruised around the Pacific, making stops and returning U.S. servicemen back to the mainland. During one of her stops, Captain Allen Smith Jr. took over command of the vessel on 19 October. She completed her &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; duties, and was discharged in January 1946. Inactivation work was conducted in the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Bremerton, Washington. Upon the completion of that work, she was decommissioned and mothballed on 7 August 1946, joining the Tacoma group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

In May 1955, &quot;Thetis Bay&quot; was withdrawn from the Pacific Reserve Fleet and towed to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard under project SCB 122, where she began conversion into the Navy&#x27;s first assault helicopter aircraft carrier. On 1 July, she was redesignated as such, receiving the hull symbol CVHA-1. Ships of her type were expected to act as a complement to attack transports, providing them with vertical assault capabilities. She was recommissioned on 20 July 1956, with Captain Thomas Winfield South, II, in command. Her conversion was finally completed six weeks later on 1 September, with a portion of the aft section of her flight deck having been cut away.
&quot;Thetis Bay&quot; then proceeded southwards towards her new home part, arriving at Long Beach on 20 September. There, she took on the helicopters of Marine Corps Test Unit No. 1, based at Camp Pendleton, who demonstrated landing and take-off techniques on this novel type of ship. She then participated in amphibious training exercises off of the California coast, evaluating her planned complementary role, before deploying to the Far East on 10 July 1957. Having completed a short tour of duty, she returned to Long Beach on 11 December, where she resumed local operations. During 1958 and 1959, she conducted a variety of operations, including vertical envelopment exercises off of Luzon, the Philippines, throughout February 1958.

On 28 May 1959, she was reclassified as a landing platform helicopter amphibious assault ship, and thus, received the hull symbol LPH-6. In August 1959, severe flooding, starting on 7 August, exacerbated by Typhoon Billie, which had earlier struck in July, killed more than a thousand people in Taiwan. Thus, &quot;Thetis Bay&quot;, which was serving with the Seventh Fleet at the time, was dispatched from Hong Kong on 12 August, proceeding to Taiwan to conduct relief operations. There, she used her 21 Marine Corps Sikorsky H-34s of Marine Helicopter Transport Squadron (Light) 261 (HMR(L)-261) to ferry aid and transport stranded civilians. She completed her mission on the noon of 20 August, at which point the helicopters had delivered a total of of aid. In addition, the helicopters had ferried 850 passengers throughout the operation.

&quot;Thetis Bay&quot;, in May 1960, took part in a training night assault landing at Camp Pendleton. During the operation, her helicopters carried 1,300 troops and of cargo to the objective area. This practice operation represented the first large-scale night landing of ground forces by helicopters based on board a carrier. She deployed to the western Pacific for the spring of 1961, and upon completing her tour and returning to Long Beach, she was transferred to the United States Atlantic Fleet. She arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, her new home port, in early December 1961.

For the next three years, &quot;Thetis Bay&quot; operated along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean. In October 1962, during the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, she proceeded into the naval &quot;quarantine&quot; area along with her helicopter contingent and a marine landing team, standing by for potential actions. In the spring of 1963, she ferried special aircraft required for President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s planned visit to West Germany to Hamburg. In September 1963, she headed to Haiti, which had been affected by Hurricane Flora. She anchored off Port-au-Prince and launched Marine helicopters carrying medical aid and food supplies.

&quot;Thetis Bay&quot; left Norfolk on 5 January 1964, heading to the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for inactivation work, arriving there on 6 January. There, she was decommissioned, once again, joining the Philadelphia group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1964, and she was sold for scrapping in December 1964 to Peck Iron &amp; Metal Co., Inc., headquartered at Portsmouth, Virginia. She was proposed to be transferred to the Spanish Navy, but the light aircraft carrier was sent in her place. She was ultimately broken up in 1966. &quot;Thetis Bay&quot; received one battle star for her World War II service. Her name plate is on display at Freedom Park, Omaha, Nebraska.

<text>After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, evidence began to emerge of failed attempts by the Iraqi government to bring the conflict to a peaceful resolution.

==Saddam Hussein&#x27;s attempts==
In December 2002, a representative of the head of Iraqi Intelligence, Gen. Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, contacted former CIA counterterrorism head Vincent Cannistraro, stating that Saddam &quot;knew there was a campaign to link him to September 11 and prove he had weapons of mass destruction.&quot; Cannistraro further added that &quot;the Iraqis were prepared to satisfy these concerns. I reported the conversation to senior levels of the state department and I was told to stand aside and they would handle it.&quot; Cannistraro stated that the offers made were all &quot;killed&quot; by the Bush administration because they allowed Saddam Hussein to remain in power – an outcome viewed as unacceptable.

Shortly after, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak&#x27;s national security advisor, Osama El-Baz, sent a message to the U.S. State Department that the Iraqis wanted to discuss the accusations that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and ties with al-Qaeda. Iraq also attempted to reach the US through the Syrian, French, German, and Russian intelligence services. Nothing came of the attempts.

==Imad Hage==
In January 2003, Lebanese-American Imad Hage met with Michael Maloof of the US Defense Department&#x27;s Office of Special Plans. Hage, a resident of Beirut, had been recruited by the department to assist in the War on Terrorism. He reported that Mohammed Nassif, a close aide to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, had expressed frustrations about the difficulties of Syria contacting the United States, and had attempted to use him as an intermediary. Maloof arranged for Hage to meet with Richard Perle, head of the Defense Policy Board.

In February 2003, Hage met with the chief of Iraqi intelligence&#x27;s foreign operations, Hassan al-Obeidi. Obeidi told Hage that Baghdad didn&#x27;t understand why they were being targeted, and that they had no WMDs; he then made the offer for Washington to send in 2000 FBI agents to ascertain this. He additionally offered oil concessions, but stopped short of having Hussein give up power, instead suggesting that elections could be held in two years. Later, Obeidi suggested that Hage travel to Baghdad for talks; he accepted.

Later that month, Hage met with Gen. Habbush in addition to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. He was offered top priority to US firms in oil and mining rights, UN-supervised elections, US inspections (with up to 5,000 inspectors), to have al-Qaeda agent Abdul Rahman Yasin (in Iraqi custody since 1994) handed over as a sign of good faith, and to give &quot;full support for any US plan&quot; in the Arab-Israeli peace process. They also wished to meet with high-ranking US officials. On February 19, Hage faxed Maloof his report of the trip. Maloof reports having brought the proposal to Jamie Duran. The Pentagon denies that either Wolfowitz or Rumsfeld, Duran&#x27;s bosses, were aware of the plan.

On February 21, Maloof informed Duran in an email that Perle wished to meet with Hage and the Iraqis if the Pentagon would clear it. Duran responded &quot;Mike, working this. Keep this close hold.&quot;. On March 7, Perle met with Hage in Knightsbridge, and stated that he wanted to pursue the matter further with people in Washington (both have acknowledged the meeting). A few days later, he informed Hage that Washington refused to let him meet with Habbush to discuss the offer (Hage stated that Perle&#x27;s response was &quot;that the consensus in Washington was it was a no-go&quot;). Perle told the Times, &quot;The message was &#x27;Tell them that we will see them in Baghdad.&quot;

Throughout March, Hage continued to pass messages from Iraqi officials to Maloof. At one point, Maloof wrote a memo stating &quot;Hage quoted Obeidi as saying this is the last window or channel through which this message has gone to the United States. He characterized the tone of Dr. Obeidi as begging.&quot; Maloof contacted Perle, stating that Iraqi officials are &quot;prepared to meet with you in Beirut, and as soon as possible, concerning &#x27;unconditional terms&#x27; &quot;, and that &quot;Such a meeting has Saddam Hussein&#x27;s clearance.&quot; No action was taken.

According to an Arab source of the &quot;Guardian&quot;, Perle sent a Saudi official the following terms for Iraq to fulfill to prevent war: &quot;Saddam&#x27;s abdication and departure, first to a US military base for interrogation and then into supervised exile, a surrender of Iraqi troops, and the admission that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.

Hage has since become embroiled in a situation involving an earlier incident involving airport security that many have viewed as payback similar to the case of Valerie Plame.

== United Kingdom ultimatum ==
On March 12, 2003, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (UK), Tony Blair, and the UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw proposed a draft resolution to the United Nations. If the demands for disarmament were met by 17 March, it was suggested that military action would be averted and Saddam Hussein would be allowed to remain in power.

The six tests involved:

* a public statement by Saddam Hussein, broadcast in Iraq, admitting possession of weapons of mass destruction, stating his regime has decided to give them up and pledging to cooperate with UN weapon inspectors.
* a commitment to allow Iraqi scientists to be interviewed by the inspectors outside Iraq.
* the surrender of, and explanation of the 10,000 litres of anthrax the Iraqis are believed still to be holding.
* a commitment to the destruction of proscribed missiles.
* an account of the unmanned aerial vehicles and remotely piloted vehicles or drones.
* a commitment to surrender all mobile bio-production laboratories for destruction.

Saddam denied possession of weapons of mass destruction. Iraqi intelligence offered to allow several thousand American troops to search for banned weapons.

By offering the opportunity for Saddam to remain in power, it suggested Blair&#x27;s only justification at that time was the presence of weapons of mass destruction and any other justifications are &quot;ex post facto&quot; justifications. On 27 March 2003, UK government whistleblowers suggested that even if the tests were met, Iraq would have been invaded.

== Exile proposal ==

It has been suggested that Saddam Hussein was prepared to go into exile if allowed to keep $1 billion USD. On February 22, at a meeting in Crawford, Texas, George Bush told Spanish prime minister Jose Maria Aznar: 

The same month Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his representative, former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov, to Saddam Hussein. Primakov&#x27;s mission was to convince Saddam to abdicate as Iraqi president, which could prevent US invasion of Iraq. The debates failed, though. &quot;Saddam just tapped me on the shoulder and went out of the room&quot;, Primakov recalled.

In late October 2005, the son of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (the late president of the United Arab Emirates) stated that Saddam Hussein had in fact accepted the offer of exile in that country. Under the deal, Saddam and his family would have fled, been granted immunity from prosecution, and elections would have been held in Iraq within six months under UN and Arab League auspices. However, according to him, the Arab League did not bring up the issue at their emergency summit, citing rules preventing interference in the affairs of their member states, thus preventing it from being accepted. Anonymous officials in the UAE have confirmed the report.

There was also speculation that Saddam would go into exile in Belarus. After the invasion, there was concern that members of Hussein&#x27;s regime were trying to flee to that country.

<text>The Prince Edward Island Liberal Party, officially the Prince Edward Island Liberal Association&quot;,&quot; is a political party in the province of Prince Edward Island, Canada. The PEI Liberals are affiliated with the federal Liberal Party of Canada.

==History==

The party was created when PEI was a British colony by reformers who agitated for the system of responsible government. This was granted by the British crown to the colony in 1851.

George Coles was its dominant figure in its first decades. While initially supportive of Canadian Confederation, Coles and the Liberals soured on the project, and it was not until 1873 that the island joined Canada as a means of relieving the PEI government&#x27;s severe debts.

The early party supported the abolition of school fees, and a resolution to the &quot;Land Question&quot; that divided the province. The Liberals supported land reform through the state acquisition of large landed estates. These estates were broken up and turned over to tenants and squatters.

The Liberals have been one of only two parties forming government on the island since 1851, the other being the Progressive Conservatives. The Liberals have formed government more often, but not in recent times. In practice, there is little to distinguish the two parties from each other: both lean towards the centre of the political spectrum. The Liberals being slightly to the left and the Conservatives (Tories) slightly to the right.

Traditionally, the Tories have done better among Protestant voters, while Liberals have had more support from Catholics. Politics on the island, however, has never been sectarian, and both parties have always had voters and members from both populations. Indeed, it has been the custom until recently for a Liberal incumbent of one denomination to be opposed by a Tory challenger of the same denomination and vice versa. This had tended to minimise religious sectarianism within the parties. The Liberals have also traditionally enjoyed the support of the province&#x27;s small Acadian population concentrated in &quot;Prince County&quot; at the west end of the island. Conservative support has tended to be greater on the eastern half of the island.

In the past forty years, the most significant figures in the party have been Alexander B. Campbell and, later, Joe Ghiz. Liberal governments in the 1960s and 1970s under Campbell supported diversification of the province&#x27;s agricultural economy. Government incentives were provided to attract manufacturing and tourism. Under Ghiz in the 1980s, the Liberals opposed free trade between Canada and the United States, and the federal Tory government&#x27;s decision to close a military base on the island. The party&#x27;s enthusiasm for economic intervention in the economy had waned since the Campbell years.

Ghiz resigned in 1993 and was succeeded by Catherine Callbeck. Callbeck was the third female premier in Canadian history and, after the 1993 election, the first to lead her party to victory in a general election. After three and a half years, Callbeck resigned and was succeeded by Keith Milligan, under whom the Liberals were defeated in the 1996 election, falling to 8 seats. Wayne Carew was elected leader in 1999, and saw the party&#x27;s fortunes fall further, winning a single seat in the 2000 election. Robert Ghiz, son of Joe Ghiz, was elected leader in 2003.

After more than ten years in opposition, the Liberals returned to government in the 2007 election, and were re-elected in 2011. Ghiz resigned in 2015 and was succeeded as party leader and premier by Wade MacLauchlan, who led the Liberals to a third victory in 2015. After twelve years in government, the Liberals were defeated in the 2019 election, and were reduced to third party status for the first time in their history, behind the Progressive Conservatives and the Green Party. MacLauchlan resigned as party leader shortly after the election.

As the only candidate to seek the leadership, Sharon Cameron was named leader on November 19, 2022. The party regained opposition status in the 2023 Prince Edward Island general election, winning three seats to the Greens&#x27; two, though the party&#x27;s 17.2% share of the popular vote was the lowest in the party&#x27;s history. Cameron placed third in her own district, and resigned as party leader days later.

Hal Perry was appointed interim leader on April 12, 2023.

<doc id="522809" wikidata="Q7875585" url="?curid=522809" title="USS Windham Bay">
<text>USS &quot;Windham Bay&quot; (CVE-92) was the thirty-eighth of fifty s built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was named after Windham Bay, within Tongass National Forest, of the Territory of Alaska. The ship was launched in March 1944, commissioned in May, and served as a replenishment and transport carrier throughout the Invasion of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet, repatriating U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She was decommissioned in August 1946, when she was mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. With the outbreak of the Korean War, however, she was called back to service, continuing to serve as a transport and utility carrier until 1959, when she was once again decommissioned. Ultimately, she was broken up in February 1961.

==Design and description==
&quot;Windham Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall; at the waterline, she was long. She had a beam of , at her widest point, this was . She also had a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Power was provided by four Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boilers. Her compact size necessitated the installation of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20 mm cannons, and the amount of 40 mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Although &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to function with a crew of 860 and an embarked squadron of 50 to 56, the exigencies of wartime often necessitated the inflation of the crew count. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more, which was often necessary during transport or replenishment missions.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942. The escort carrier was laid down on 5 January 1944 under the name &quot;Windham Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was laid down as MC hull 1129, the thirty-eighth of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. She therefore received the classification symbol CVE-92, indicating that she was the ninety-second escort carrier to be commissioned into the United States Navy. She was launched on 29 March 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Henry M. Cooper; transferred to the Navy and commissioned on 3 May 1944, with Captain Charles William Oexle in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===
Upon being commissioned, &quot;Windham Bay&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego, arriving on 6 June. She then briefly conducted air qualifications and catapult trials off the southern California coast, before taking on a load of aircraft and passengers bound for Hawaii. On 12 June, she left port, arriving within Pearl Harbor on 19 June, trading her cargo for another load, this time bound for the Marshall Islands. She left Pearl Harbor on 25 June, arriving at Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 2 July. She then sailed westwards to Kwajalein Atoll, also within the Marshalls. There, she took on the aircraft and personnel of Marine Night Fighter Squadron 532 (VMF(N)-532), and steamed for the Mariana Islands. The squadron arrived on Saipan, which had recently been secured, by flying off of her flight deck, and she put into Garapan anchorage to unload the squadron&#x27;s gear.

Whilst in anchorage, &quot;Windham Bay&quot; loaded up a squadron of captured Japanese aircraft, and proceeded back to Hawaii. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 10 July, and remained in port for fifteen days, before departing for the West Coast on 25 July. She returned to port in San Diego on 31 July, and she began overhaul at San Pedro, where additional anti-aircraft armaments were retrofitted.

This process took up the entire month of August, and &quot;Windham Bay&quot; returned to sea on 1 September, with a load of aircraft bound for Emirau and Manus, of the Admiralty Islands. She arrived at Emirau in mid-September, and at Manus on 18 September. After unloading her aircraft, she took on a load of passengers and steamed for Espiritu Santo, of the New Hebrides, and upon completing this task, she took on another load of aircraft, returning to Manus on 5 October. She then visited Guadalcanal, of the Solomon Islands, before heading back to the West Coast. Proceeding via Espiritu Santo, she arrived back in San Diego on 20 October. She then made another transport mission to the South Pacific in November, transporting aircraft to Manus and collecting about 350 casualties from the Palau campaign at Guadalcanal on 24 November for transport back to San Diego.

Upon returning to port in San Diego on 10 December, &quot;Windham Bay&quot; remained inactive until 27 December, when she resumed transporting aircraft. During this stay, Lieutenant (temporarily promoted to Commander) Theophilus Horner Moore assumed temporary command of the carrier until it arrived at Pearl Harbor. Proceeding westwards, she transported a load of aircraft to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 2 January 1945 before taking on a load of F4U Corsairs. There, Captain Maxwell Franklin Leslie took over permanent command of &quot;Windham Bay&quot;. Leaving port on 5 January, she headed to Midway Atoll in the Hawaiian Islands, arriving on 9 January, where she unloaded her cargo. The following day, she left Midway, returning to Pearl Harbor on 13 January. She left port on 1 February, this time as a replenishment carrier, providing replacement aircraft, parts, and supplies for the frontline Fast Carrier Task Force of the Third Fleet, which at the time was preparing to provide support for the planned invasion of Iwo Jima. On her way out towards the Central Pacific, &quot;Windham Bay&quot; stopped at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands, before steaming for Ulithi Atoll in the Caroline Islands.

Upon taking on board the cargo required to sustain her replenishment duties, &quot;Windham Bay&quot; took to sea, as a part of Task Unit 50.8.4, the CVE Plane Transport Unit, along with her sister ships , , and . As a part of Task Group 50.8, the Logistics Support Group, the replenishment carriers were under the command of Rear Admiral Donald B. Beary. En route, the carriers were screened by the destroyer escorts , , and . She arrived off Iwo Jima on 19 February, whereupon she began delivering replacement aircraft and crews to the fleet carriers conducting operations over the island, with the transferring aircraft being screened by the fighter contingents of and . Task Unit 50.8.4 first conducted deliveries to Task Groups 58.1, 58.4, and 58.5 on 19 February, conducted deliveries to Task Groups 58.2 and 58.3 the following day, and then deliveries to all the Task Groups excepting 58.5 on 21 February. Her main duties finished, &quot;Windham Bay&quot; continued delivering a trickle of planes until 1 March, when her Task Group returned to replenish at Ulithi. In total, the four escort carriers had delivered 254 aircraft and 65 plane crews to the fleet carriers, the majority of which were transferred on the first three days.

Later, upon having replenished, Task Group 50.8.4. took to sea again, and beginning on 1 April, in addition to resupplying the Fast Carrier Task Force, the escort carriers also shouldered the burden of providing replacement aircraft and supplies for the CVEs providing air cover for the landings on Okinawa. Taking advantage of the Kerama Islands, which had been recently captured on 26 March, the escort carriers were able to quickly replenish on bombs and ammunition, minimizing the amount of time spent away from the frontline carriers.

By the early morning of 5 June, &quot;Windham Bay&quot;, along with the ships of Task Group 38.1 and Task Group 30.8, was trapped in the path of Typhoon Connie, which was proceeding northwards, and on a course to the east of Okinawa. Admiral William Halsey Jr., which had already led the Third Fleet into the deadly Typhoon Cobra in December 1944, now managed to lead the Third Fleet yet again into the eyewall of another deadly storm, ignoring reports by Rear Admiral Beary, who was convinced that Halsey&#x27;s eastwardly course would put his carriers into the storm. By the time this had become evident, the replenishment carriers had already found themselves navigating independently of each other. As &quot;Windham Bay&quot; neared the center of the storm, at around 3:00, her crew began to witness the aircraft stored upon the flight deck work free of their restraints and slip into the sea.

A few minutes later, &quot;Windham Bay&quot; entered the eyewall. The carrier&#x27;s wind-measuring system was quickly blown away by the gusts, but the crew estimated the winds to be gusting at around . In addition, waves estimated as towering some high broke over the carrier. Despite the fact that her forward aircraft elevator was up, water seeped through the edges of the elevator, flooding the elevator well with of water and temporarily taking it out of commission. At 3:55, as the carrier crested over a particularly high swell, the two forwardmost 40 mm Bofors guns, along with the forward lookout platform, were ejected off the ship. Simultaneously, the forwardmost of her flight deck collapsed onto her forecastle, damaging both her hangar deck and aircraft elevator.

The damage sustained during the typhoon necessitated repairs, and &quot;Windham Bay&quot; was therefore relieved of her replenishment duties. Heading eastwards, she stopped at the Marianas on 16 June on her way to Oahu, where quick repairs were made. In addition, she took on a load of F4U-2 Corsairs for transport. Stopping at Pearl Harbor from 25 June to 27 June, she entered port at San Diego on 11 July for extensive repairs, which took until late August to finish, after the Japanese surrender had been announced.

On 26 August, with her repairs having concluded, &quot;Windham Bay&quot; left San Diego harbor, with Marine Fighter Squadron 312 (VMF-312) on board, bound for Guam. Stopping briefly at Pearl Harbor, she arrived in Apra Harbor on 15 September. Having unloaded her passengers and cargo, she steamed for Samar and Leyte, within the Philippines, arriving on 19 September, taking on passengers, planes, and equipment for transport back to Hawaii. She departed Leyte on 24 September, stopped at Guam on 27 September, and arrived back at Oahu on 7 October. She left port on 8 October, and arrived back in San Diego harbor on 14 October.

Whilst in port, &quot;Windham Bay&quot; joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. On 19 October, the carrier left on her first run, a voyage which ended at San Pedro. She left for another run on 13 November, arriving at Samar on 26 November, leaving on 28 November. Pausing at Pearl Harbor, she arrived in Port Hueneme, California on 17 December. She then proceeded a short ways southward back to San Pedro port, where she remained until the New Year.

On 8 January 1946, &quot;Windham Bay&quot; departed San Pedro again, making a round trip to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 14 January. Leaving port on 15 January, she returned to California on 21 January. She then sailed north to Tacoma, Washington, arriving on 25 January, where she was to be mothballed as part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Inactivation work began as soon as she arrived, and she was decommissioned on 23 August.

===Korean War===

&quot;Windham Bay&quot; continued to be mothballed with the Pacific Reserve Fleet until the Korean War broke out during the summer of 1950. With the United States intervening in the war, under the auspices of the United Nations, &quot;Windham Bay&quot; was recommissioned and reclassified as an aircraft transport with the hull symbol T-CVE-92 on 28 October 1950 at Bremerton, Washington, with Captain Charles E. Brunton in command. As an aircraft transport, she was operated by the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) with a civilian crew, but with a military command. On 20 November, she steamed south to California, stopping at San Francisco on her way to San Diego, arriving on 2 December. She then sailed northwards, back to San Francisco, arriving on 13 December. There, she headed to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 19 December. Returning to California, she sailed into Alameda, California on 2 January 1951, before heading back into the Pacific on 7 January, this time with a load of aircraft bound for Korea. She arrived at Yokohama, Japan on 24 January, where she unloaded her cargo. She left Yokohama harbor on 26 January, proceeding southwards, where she visited Saigon in French Indochina. In doing this visit, &quot;Windham Bay&quot; became the first large vessel to enter the Long Gam River since 1925. Whilst she was docked in Saigon, Vietnamese rebels tossed seventeen hand grenades at the carrier, albeit none exploded. After completing her visit, she headed to Manila, the capital of the Philippines, before heading back to the West Coast. &quot;Windham Bay&quot; sailed into the San Francisco Bay on 24 February.

For the next twenty months, &quot;Windham Bay&quot; made nine round-trip transpacific resupply voyages, loading up at either San Francisco or San Diego, always unloading at Yokosuka, and always returning to San Francisco. She broke this routine in October and November 1952, when she visited Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and Bangkok, Thailand, before returning via Japan to Alameda on 9 December. &quot;Windham Bay&quot; continued her transpacific resupply voyages between the West Coast and Japan throughout 1953. As the Korean War wound down to an armistice, her transport missions began to involve more stops and side trips, notably to Hawaii, the Philippines, and to other Japanese ports besides Yokosuka. French Indochina became a frequent destination, with &quot;Windham Bay&quot; stopping at the capital of Saigon in May 1954, February 1955, and in March 1955, which by then had become part of the Republic of Vietnam. On 12 June 1955, she was reclassified as a utility carrier, with the hull symbol CVU-92. On 4 August 1956, she was severely damaged by a fire which broke out whilst she was docked in Alameda. In May 1957, she added Naha, Okinawa to her list of ports of call, and in December 1957, she made another stop to Saigon. In all other respects, &quot;Windham Bay&quot;″s career as a transport carrier during this period consisted solely of missions resupplying aircraft from the West Coast to Japan, conducted in support of the fast carriers assigned to cover the western Pacific.

&quot;Windham Bay&quot;″s career as a transport carrier lasted until the end of 1958, during a time in which the navy evaluated the &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers to be less economical and less desirable as transport carriers as compared to the older s. Therefore, she was yet again decommissioned and mothballed in January 1959, this time as part of the San Francisco Group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 February 1959, and subsequently sold for scrapping to the Hugo Neu Steel Products Corp., of New York City. The ship was ultimately scrapped in Japan throughout February 1961. &quot;Windham Bay&quot; received three battle stars for her World War II service.

<text>Etrigan the Demon is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Jack Kirby, Etrigan is a demon from Hell who, despite his violent tendencies, usually finds himself allied with the forces of good, mainly because of the alliance between the heroic characters of the DC Universe and Jason Blood, a human to whom Etrigan is bound. Etrigan is commonly depicted as a muscular humanoid creature with orange or yellow skin, horns, red eyes, and pointed, webbed ears, who frequently speaks in rhymes. The character was originally based in Gotham City, leading to numerous team-ups with Batman.

Since his conception, Etrigan has been adapted into several forms of media outside of comics, including animated series, films, and video games. He is voiced by Michael T. Weiss in the DC Animated Universe, Dee Bradley Baker in &quot;&quot;, Patrick Seitz in &quot;Justice League Action&quot;, and Ray Chase in the DC Animated Movie Universe.

==Creation==
Kirby&#x27;s former assistant, Mark Evanier, said that Carmine Infantino asked Jack Kirby to create a new monster hero. Kirby or Infantino mentioned a demon, and Kirby from that point worked on creating a demonic character. Evanier said that he was with Kirby and several others during a dinner at a restaurant, and Kirby came up with Etrigan&#x27;s name, back story, and motivations on the spot. Kirby intended to create the character but pass him off to others to write and draw. However, Infantino convinced him to make the first issue, suspended Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World comics series, and moved Kirby to the Etrigan comics.

==Publication history==
Etrigan first appeared in &quot;The Demon&quot; #1 (September 1972) and was created by Jack Kirby. He created him at the behest of DC, who saw it as likely to be more commercially successful than the Fourth World and cancelled &quot;New Gods&quot; and &quot;Forever People&quot; to facilitate work on the new title. According to Evanier, Kirby had no interest in horror comics, but created Etrigan in response to DC&#x27;s demand for a horror character. Kirby was annoyed that Etrigan&#x27;s popularity forced him to abandon the Fourth World titles before he was done with them.

Etrigan returned for a four-issue miniseries in 1987, written and illustrated by Matt Wagner. Alan Grant followed this with an Etrigan feature in &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot; #636-641 and a second ongoing title in 1990. The 1990 series lasted 58 issues, two &quot;Annual&quot;s and one #0 issue. Garth Ennis took over the title beginning with issue #40. Ennis&#x27; run included the first appearance of his character Hitman. This series was followed by a miniseries, &quot;Driven Out&quot;. Following this, John Byrne&#x27;s &quot;Blood of the Demon&quot; lasted 17 issues, and ignored much of the continuity that took place after Kirby&#x27;s initial run.

While his first monthly comic book series was short-lived, and his second was canceled after five years, Etrigan remains a popular supporting character with occasional additional miniseries. Series in which Etrigan has appeared include Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot;, Kevin Smith&#x27;s &quot;Green Arrow&quot; and &quot;&quot;, Garth Ennis&#x27;s &quot;Hitman&quot;, and &quot;Cosmic Odyssey&quot; by Jim Starlin and Mike Mignola.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===

In &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted continuity, DC Comics launched a new series featuring Etrigan titled &quot;Demon Knights&quot;, which debuted on September 14, 2011. It was written by Paul Cornell and drawn by Diógenes Neves.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre/Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
Etrigan, son of the demon Belial, is summoned by the wizard Merlin, his half-brother. Unable to gain the creature&#x27;s secrets, he bonds the demon with Jason Blood, a knight in King Arthur&#x27;s Camelot. This renders Jason immortal, which he alternately considers either a penance or a curse.

In modern times, Jason Blood resurfaces as a prominent demonologist in Gotham City. Jason is called to the crypt of Merlin and discovers a poem that causes him to switch places with Etrigan (appearing to transform him into Etrigan). To his misfortune, he is followed by the long-lived Morgaine le Fey, who lusts for Merlin&#x27;s secrets. That leads to Etrigan&#x27;s first major battle. Over the years, Etrigan both clashes with and occasionally aids Earth&#x27;s heroes, guided by his own whims and Blood&#x27;s attempts to use his power for good.

Some time after his first appearance, Etrigan begins speaking in rhyme due to a promotion in Hell, though he is not limited to rhyme. He leads the forces of Hell in a battle against the Great Evil Beast and is in brief contact with the entity in its questions about its nature - he barely survives the attempt. His high rank would also see him guide Dream of the Endless from Hell&#x27;s gates to Lucifer.
Some time after this, Jason Blood and Glenda Mark attempt to separate him and Etrigan, an event which leads to Belial transforming Blood&#x27;s ally Harry Matthews into a pillow. The two are successfully separated, but lose their immortality and age rapidly before being reunited in &quot;Cosmic Odyssey&quot;.

After the remerging, the relationship between Blood and Etrigan becomes even more contentious. Drawn to Hell by the Archfiend Asteroth, Etrigan stops Asteroth&#x27;s attempt to sacrifice Glenda Mark, Randu Singh, Merlin and Blood himself (in Hell, Blood and Etrigan were, at the time, separated). Etrigan followed these events by overthrowing the triumvirate of leaders in Hell (Lucifer, Belial and Beezlebub) and taking the symbol of authority in Hell, the Crown of Horns, for himself. He battles Lobo, Klarion the Witch Boy and his gang and is drawn into the Realm Beyond, where he meets the Thing-That-Cannot-Die and reunites with his older brother, Lord Scapegoat.

Upon escape from the Realm Beyond, Etrigan and Blood agree to work together and team with Batman and Robin against the Howler. Soon after, Etrigan is chosen as a political candidate for President of the United States and nearly succeeds in securing the Republican nomination from George H. W. Bush. During his political run, he attempts to gain Superman&#x27;s endorsement, but is denied.

Blood and Mark later have a daughter named Kathryn. He decides to destroy Etrigan and hires hitman Tommy Monaghan to help him. After a battle against both Merlin and Etrigan, the two rescue Kathryn and Blood steals Etrigan&#x27;s heart, which enables him to control him. Monaghan cons Blood into returning to Gotham and using Etrigan to retrieve the Ace of Winchesters, an anti-demon rifle, from Hell. Despite the risk of Etrigan killing him, Monahgan trades him his heart for the Ace of Winchesters.

Jason Blood later joins a substitute Justice League group after the main group vanishes during an attempt to rescue Aquaman from the past. He later leaves the group and passes his position as a magic specialist to Manitou Raven.

The series &quot;Blood of the Demon&quot;, plotted and drawn by John Byrne and scripted by Will Pfeifer, began in May 2005. Etrigan apparently loses the restrictions imposed upon him by the wizard Merlin which turned him from evil, caused by his &quot;murder&quot; at the exact moment he was transforming from his human self, Jason Blood, into his demon self. It turns out that the incident has resulted in Blood being able to exert some will over Etrigan&#x27;s violent nature, whereas previously the two remained separate. &quot;Blood of the Demon&quot; ended with issue #17 in July 2006.

Etrigan later attempts to use the Trident of Lucifer to take control of Hell. A makeshift Shadowpact team successfully takes the Trident from him and flees to the Oblivion Bar. Etrigan follows and battles the team inside the bar. He is petrified by the Midnight Rider&#x27;s ghost pistols and used as a hat rack before being returned to normal by sunrise.

Etrigan takes part in the war for control of Hell on behalf of Neron, duelling Blue Devil. Later, due to the effects of a magical drug Satanus had infested Hell with, he was transformed into a soulless physical human, a perfect duplicate of Jason Blood. Blood, meanwhile, has taken steps as to interfere with any possible attempts of Etrigan&#x27;s to re-merge.

In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Deadman possesses Etrigan to battle the Black Lanterns.

Etrigan briefly appears in the prelude to the JLA/JSA crossover during the &quot;Brightest Day&quot; event. Etrigan travels to Germany to find a crashed meteorite that contains an unconscious Jade and confronts the Justice League after attacking a squad of German superheroes. He mocks the League by claiming they are an inferior team of substitutes, but is ultimately defeated when Donna Troy uses her Lasso of Persuasion to force him back into his Jason Blood form. Jason apologizes for the trouble he caused and departs from the scene, but not before warning Batman and his teammates that the meteorite possesses supernatural qualities. The meteor is later revealed to be the Starheart, a legendary entity that has the power to possess metahumans with magical or elemental abilities.

Etrigan is shown aiding the JLA during their mission into Hell, where he helps Hawkman defeat a demonic beast. He also was the guide to the Secret Six in their trip to Hell and led Catman to see the fate of his father, all the while amused by the confusion and pain they were suffering as a result of their visit.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In &quot;The New 52&quot;, the 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe, his past and origins are largely changed. Before the Dark Ages, Etrigan was a Rhyming Demon who served Lucifer before leading a rebellion against him. Jason of Norwich had been sent to Camelot as a scribe to Merlin and was growing frustrated with life, believing he was meant for greater things and suffering from rages. A prophecy showed that if Jason did not have some sort of quest to force him to heal himself, his rage would grow and cause him to kill his love, Madame Xanadu. During the fall of Camelot, Merlin bonded Etrigan to Jason in an attempt to provide this quest.

Now immortal, Jason and Etrigan came to an agreement and shared their existence. Madame Xanadu began traveling with Jason, only to find Etrigan had now begun falling for her as well and would slaughter innocents if he thought she and Jason were happy together. To placate the demon, she pretended to be in love with him and cuckolding Jason.

Over the centuries, Jason became known as Jason o&#x27; the Blood and Etrigan continued to practice his rhymes. By the Dark Ages, he and Etrigan became the centre of a rag-tag team of adventurers, the &quot;Demon Knights&quot;: Jason/Etrigan, Xanadu, Vandal Savage, Shining Knight, the Horsewoman, Saracen inventor Al Jabr (&quot;The Numbers&quot; in Arabic) and the Amazon Exoristos (&quot;The Exile&quot; in Greek). They first fought Mordru and the Questing Queen&#x27;s army to a standstill before being tasked by the city of Alba Sarum to return Merlin to life at Avalon. Etrigan plotted to betray his teammates&#x27; souls and Avalon itself to Lucifer to curry his favour. While he successfully manipulated the Knights into letting Hell invade Avalon (and secretly felt guilty about his treatment of Xanadu), he was himself captured and used by the Questing Queen to gain access as well. Lucifer believed Etrigan had done this deliberately and condemned him; outraged, the demon refused to serve anyone again. At the end of the battle, Jason was tasked as a member of Avalon&#x27;s Stormwatch, but neither he nor Xanadu wanted to serve Merlin after having Etrigan forced on them again. Jason vowed to not let the demon out so often.

In the present, Etrigan&#x27;s body lies buried in London; it is explained that he was sealed there by his own friends because of his betrayal of them, but magic emanating from it is able to possess persons above, eventually freeing the demon, who promptly attacks Midnighter and Apollo. The entire Stormwatch then battles Etrigan, but after being defeated, he is able to possess a host and flees.

During &quot;Trinity War&quot;, Etrigan is among the superheroes who feel the disturbance in the magical plane when Shazam picks up Pandora&#x27;s Box. In the timeline of &quot;The New 52: Futures End&quot;, Zatanna is romantically involved with Etrigan.

==Characterization==
===Transformation incantation===
To transform into Etrigan, Blood must recite the poem from Merlin&#x27;s crypt (though usually he only recites the last two lines). The poem does not have to be spoken for it to work. For instance, in one adventure, Blood is magically transformed into a fly by the warlock Shahn-Zi. Unable to speak, Blood triggers the change by writing out the poem in the dust.
To return to human form, a couplet must be recited, either by Etrigan or someone else in his hearing, but there are several versions of it:

In other media such as &quot;Justice League Dark&quot;, a different poem is used to return Etrigan to human form:

==Powers and abilities==
===Etrigan===
Even among demons, Etrigan is considered to be extremely powerful. He has mystically enhanced superhuman strength, to the degree that he can stand against other powerhouses such as Superman, Wonder Woman, and Lobo. He has a high degree of resistance to injury and can project hellfire from his body, usually from his mouth. He has a very high command of magic. Other powers include mystically enhanced fangs and claws, enhanced senses, super speed, agility, telepathy, energy blasts, and precognition. His sadomasochistic nature allows him to enjoy pain as if it were pleasure, making him generally fearless in the face of combat and torture. His healing factor can handle an incredible amount of damage, allowing him to recover from wounds that have removed large sections of his body. He also has pyrokinesis and cryokinesis enabling him to manipulate fire and ice.

===Jason Blood===
Jason Blood is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant, including mastery in swordsmanship. Jason is adept at magic, and is often called upon to act as an advisor or investigator in occult matters. He has limited precognition and telepathy. Jason is technically immortal due to his connection to the demon Etrigan. He has the combined experiences of Etrigan since he was bonded to the demon. Jason Blood shares all of Etrigan&#x27;s weaknesses.

===Weaknesses===
Etrigan has all the limitations usually associated with a demon, including a weakness towards holy powers, holy water and iron. While his command of magic is strong, it is considered to be less than his father, Belial, and half-brother, Merlin. Additionally, Belial granted the &quot;power of Etrigan&quot; to both Merlin and another son, Lord Scapegoat. He is also helpless against those with magic strong enough to control him, such as Morgaine le Fey. He is also said to have a strong frailty for certain sounds as well.

<text>The Convair RIM-2 Terrier was a two-stage medium-range naval surface-to-air missile (SAM), among the earliest SAMs to equip United States Navy ships. It underwent significant upgrades while in service, starting with beam-riding guidance with a range at a speed of Mach 1.8 and ending as a semi-active radar homing (SARH) system with a range of at speeds as high as Mach 3. It was replaced in service by the RIM-67 Standard ER (SM-1ER).

Terrier has also been used as the base stage for a family of sounding rockets, beginning with the Terrier Malemute.

== History ==
The Terrier was a development of the Bumblebee Project, the United States Navy&#x27;s effort to develop a surface-to-air missile to provide a middle layer of defense against air attack (between carrier fighters and antiaircraft guns). It was test launched from on January 28, 1953, and first deployed operationally on the s, and , in the mid-1950s, with &quot;Canberra&quot; being the first to achieve operational status on June 15, 1956. Its US Navy designation was SAM-N-7 until 1963, when it was redesignated RIM-2.

For a brief time during the mid-1950s, the United States Marine Corps (USMC) had two Terrier battalions equipped with specially modified twin sea launchers for land use that fired the SAM-N-7. The Terrier was the first surface-to-air missile operational with the USMC. The launchers were reloaded by a special vehicle that carried two Terrier reloads.

Initially, the Terrier used radar beam-riding guidance, forward aerodynamic controls, and a conventional warhead. It had a top speed of Mach 1.8, a range of only , and was only effective against subsonic targets. Originally, the Terrier had a launch thrust of and weight of . Its original dimensions were a diameter of , a length of , and a fin span of . The cost per missile in 1957 was an estimated $60,000.

Even before it was in widespread service, the Terrier saw major improvements. The RIM-2C, named the Terrier BT-3 (Beam-riding, Tail control, series 3), was introduced in 1958. The forward control fins were replaced with fixed strakes, and the tail became the control surface. The BT-3 also had a new motor and featured an extended range, Mach 3 speed, and better maneuverability. The RIM-2D Terrier BT-3A(N) entered service in 1962 with a W30 1kt nuclear warhead, but all other variants used a 218 lb (99 kg) controlled-fragmentation warhead. The Terrier had 2 versions: BT-3(N) and HT-3. Only the BT-3A carried the nuclear warhead, BT-3A(N).

When fired, and after booster separation, its corkscrew contrail progressed to the center of the beam. Reception of its location in the beam was accomplished by a small turnstile antenna at the rear of the missile; this antenna also received the commands for detonation and self-destruct. The self destruct-command was sent a few milliseconds after the detonation command. The HT-3 was a SARH missile; it followed the reflected energy from the target. However, if jamming were encountered, it would passively home in on the jamming signal.

The &quot;Belknap&quot; class of DLG, redesignated CG, also carried the ASROC (Anti Submarine Rocket), which was launched from the same launcher as the Terrier. The &quot;Belknap&quot; class had 3 circular magazines in a triangle pattern. The bottom magazine contained the nuclear BT-3A(N) missiles and the Nuclear Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC). This was an additional safety feature in that it involved transferring the Nuclear Missile from the bottom ring to the upper ring and then to the launcher rails, which entailed many moving steps and time, preventing the accidental loading of a Nuclear Missile from one of the top two magazines.

The RIM-2E introduced SARH for greater effectiveness against low-flying targets. The final version, the RIM-2F, used a new motor that doubled effective range to .

The Terrier was the primary missile system of most US Navy cruisers and guided missile frigates built during the 1960s. It could be installed on much smaller ships than the much larger and longer-ranged RIM-8 Talos. A Terrier installation typically consisted of the Mk 10 twin-arm launcher with a 40-round rear-loading magazine, Some ships had extended magazines with 60 or 80 rounds, and the installation in &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;Canberra&quot; used a bottom-loading magazine of 72 rounds.

The French Navy&#x27;s Masurca missile was developed with some technology provided by the USN from Terrier.

The Terrier was replaced by the extended range RIM-67 Standard missile. The RIM-67 offered the range of the much larger RIM-8 Talos in a missile the size of the Terrier.

The system was decommissioned in USN service in 1995 and by the last foreign user, the Italian Navy, in 2006. 

===Combat service===
On April 19, 1972, a Terrier missile fired by was claimed by the US to have shot down a North Vietnamese Air Force MiG-17F in the Battle of Dong Hoi.

===Research use===

Terrier has also been used, typically as a first stage in a sounding rocket, for conducting high-altitude research. The Terrier can be equipped with various upper stages, like the Asp, the TE-416 Tomahawk (not to be confused with the similarly named BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missile), the Orion, or any of a variety of purpose-built second stages such as Oriole or Malemute. The booster also served as the basis for the MIM-3 Nike Ajax booster, which was slightly larger but otherwise similar, and has also seen widespread use in sounding rockets.

<text>Romance films involve romantic love stories recorded in visual media for broadcast in theatres or on television that focus on passion, emotion, and the affectionate romantic involvement of the main characters. Typically their journey through dating, courtship or marriage is featured. These films focus on the search for romantic love as the main plot focus. Occasionally, romance lovers face obstacles such as finances, physical illness, various forms of discrimination, psychological restraints, or family resistance. As in all quite strong, deep, and close romantic relationships, the tensions of day-to-day life, temptations (of infidelity), and differences in compatibility enter into the plots of romantic films.

Romantic films often explore the essential themes of love at first sight, young and mature love, unrequited love, obsession, sentimental love, spiritual love, forbidden love, platonic love, sexual and passionate love, sacrificial love, explosive and destructive love, and tragic love. Romantic films serve as great escapes and fantasies for viewers, especially if the two leads finally overcome their difficulties, declare their love, and experience their &quot;happily ever after&quot;, often implied by a reunion and final kiss. In romantic television series, such romantic relationships may develop over many episodes or different characters may become intertwined in different romantic arcs.

Screenwriter and scholar Eric R. Williams identifies Romance Films as one of eleven super-genres in his screenwriters&#x27; taxonomy, claiming that all feature-length narrative films can be classified by these super-genres. The other ten super-genres are action, crime, fantasy, horror, science fiction, comedy, sports, thriller, war and western.

== Decline in romance films ==

The proportion of romance films within the total number of movies produced has significantly declined in recent years. According to data from IMDb, the share of romance films decreased from 34.8% of all movies released in 2000 to 8.6% in the most recent year reported.

Romance films have experienced a cyclical presence in cinema history. They constituted a substantial portion of the movies released from the 1940s through the early 1960s, followed by a notable decline. The genre experienced a gradual recovery over the last three decades of the 20th century, peaking in the early 2000s. However, this trend has reversed in more recent times. Moreover, the integration of romance as a subplot in films of other genres, such as action movies, also appears to be diminishing.

==Subgenres==
=== Chick flick ===
″Chick flick″ is a term associated with romance films mostly targeted to a female audience. Although many romance films may be targeted at women, it is not a defining characteristic of a romance film and a ″&quot;chick flick″&quot; does not necessarily have a romance as a central theme, revolve around the romantic involvement of characters or even include a romantic relationship. As such, the terms cannot be used interchangeably. Films of this genre include &quot;Gilda&quot;, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;, &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;, &quot;The Notebook&quot;, &quot;Dear John&quot;, &quot;A Walk to Remember, Thelma &amp; Louise, Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;, &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;,&quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; and&quot; Romeo + Juliet.&quot;

=== Historical romance ===

Also known as epic romance, this is a romantic story with a historical period setting, normally with a turbulent backdrop of war, revolution, or tragedy. This includes films such as &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, &quot;Reds&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;A Very Long Engagement&quot;, &quot;Atonement&quot;, &quot;Portrait of a Lady on Fire&quot;, and &quot;Cold War&quot;.

=== Paranormal romance ===

Paranormal romance is a popular genre of film that features romantic relationships between humans and supernatural creatures. Popular tropes include vampirism, time travel, ghosts and psychic or telekinetic abilities – i.e. things that cannot be explained by science. The genre originated in literature and moved on to the screen in the early 2000s, following the success of the Twilight Saga adaptations from Stephenie Meyer&#x27;s books. By 2007–08, film studios were producing various paranormal romance films, many adapted from novels.

Examples of paranormal romance films include &quot;The Twilight Saga&quot;, &quot;Warm Bodies&quot;, &quot;Vampire Academy&quot;, &quot;I Am Dragon&quot;, and &quot;The Shape of Water&quot;.

=== Romantic comedy ===
Romantic comedies are films with light-hearted, humorous plotlines centered on romantic ideals such as true love being able to surmount most obstacles. Humour in such films tends to be of a verbal, low-key variety or situational, as opposed to slapstick. Films within this genre include &quot;City Lights&quot;, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;, &quot;My Wife&#x27;s Goblin&quot;, &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;, &quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot;, &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;, &quot;Good Morning, My Dear Wife&quot;, &quot;The Big Sick&quot;, &quot;Enough Said&quot;, &quot;Lost In Translation&quot;, &quot;To All the Boys I&#x27;ve Loved Before&quot;, &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;, &quot;Dave&quot;, &quot;Say Anything...&quot;, &quot;Moonstruck&quot;, &quot;In Summer We Must Love&quot;, &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;, &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot;, &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot;, &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, &quot;Manhattan&quot;, &quot;The Apartment&quot; and &quot;Pablo and Carolina&quot;.

=== Romantic drama ===
Romantic dramas usually revolve around an obstacle that prevents deep and true love between two people. Music is often employed to indicate the emotional mood, creating an atmosphere of greater insulation for the couple. The conclusion of a romantic drama typically does not indicate whether a final romantic union between the two main characters will occur.

Some examples of romantic drama films and shows before 2000 are &quot;Man&#x27;s Way with Women&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;María Candelaria&quot;, &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot;, &quot;Appointment with Happiness&quot;, &quot;Wakeful Eyes&quot;, &quot;Among the Ruins&quot;, &quot;The River of Love&quot;, &quot;Dearer than my Life&quot;, &quot;Love Story&quot;, &quot;Paris and Love&quot;, &quot;Featureless Men&quot;, &quot;Coming Home&quot;, &quot;Daughters of the Dust&quot;, &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;, &quot;Sommersby&quot;, &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;, &quot;The English Patient&quot;, &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;, &quot; Saptapadi&quot; and &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot;.

21st century examples include &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot;, &quot;Sideways&quot;, &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;, &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;, &quot;Up in the Air&quot;, &quot;The Artist&quot;, &quot;Gloria Bell&quot;, and &quot;Malcolm &amp; Marie&quot;.

Director Richard Linklater helmed the prominent &quot;Before&quot; trilogy, consisting of &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Before Sunset&quot;, and &quot;Before Midnight&quot;.

&quot;Kasautii Zindagii Kay&quot; is a popular Indian romantic drama television series of the 2000s.

Same-sex romantic dramas that tackle LGBT issues include &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, &quot;Blue is the Warmest Colour&quot;, &quot;Carol&quot;, &quot;Moonlight&quot;, and &quot;Call Me by Your Name&quot;.

=== Romantic fantasy ===

Romantic fantasies describe fantasy stories using many of the elements and conventions of the romance genre. Some examples include &quot;The Lady Eve&quot;, &quot;Top Hat&quot;, &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (Les Parapluies de Cherbourg)&quot;, &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, &quot;Enchanted&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Knowing&quot;, &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot;, &quot;Midnight in Paris,&quot; &quot;Her,&quot; and &quot;The Shape of Water.&quot;

=== Romantic musical ===
Romantic musical (alternatively musical romance) is a genre of film that features romantic relationships and whose story is partially explained through song and/or dance numbers. This genre originated on Broadway and moved to the silver screen thanks in part to the popularity of the Rodgers and Hammerstein productions.

Some examples include &quot;South Pacific&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot; and its 2021 remake, &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;High School Musical&quot;, &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;, the &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; franchise, &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot;, and &quot;La La Land&quot;.

=== Romantic thriller ===
Romantic thriller is a film genre with a storyline combining elements of the romance film and the thriller genre. Some examples of romantic thriller films are &quot;Desire&quot;, &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;, &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;The Crying Game&quot;, &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;, &quot;Unfaithful&quot;, &quot;Wicker Park&quot;, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;The Tourist&quot;, and &quot;The Adjustment Bureau&quot;.

== Film types, macro genres and the filmmaker&#x27;s voice ==
The screenwriters taxonomy creates additional categories beyond &quot;subgenre&quot; when discussing films, making the argument that all narrative Hollywood films can be delineated into comedies or dramas (identified as a &quot;film type&quot;). The taxonomy also identifies fifty &quot;macro genres&quot;, which can be paired with the romance super genre. Using this approach, films like &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (noted above) would be classified as a dramatic (type) historical/family (macro genres) romance (genre) rather than simply a historical romance; while &quot;The Notebook&quot; would be identified at dramatic (type) disease (macro genre) romance (genre) rather than simply a romantic drama.

Similarly, musicals are categorized as one option for a filmmaker&#x27;s &quot;voice&quot; because the artistic choice to have the characters sing does not affect the story or the characters – it simply alters how the story and characters are conveyed. Therefore, a romance film like &quot;Grease&quot; would be categorized as a dramatic (type), romance (super genre), high school / coming of age (macro genres), musical (voice) – rather than simply as a &quot;musical romance&quot;.

<doc id="522823" wikidata="Q6738154" url="?curid=522823" title="List of Major League Baseball attendance records">
<text>==Most attended game in history==
The all-time attendance record of 115,300 was set at a preseason game between the defending champions Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers on March 29, 2008, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. According to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, this is the only baseball game where the 100,000 figure has been definitively exceeded.

==Least attended game in history==
The record was set on September 28, 1882, in game between the Troy Trojans and the Worcesters in Worcester, Massachusetts, which some reports had only six spectators attend. As both clubs had been notified that they were being dropped from the National League, fans had very little interest in watching the lame-duck teams, especially on a day which the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; described as &quot;bleak, cold and windy&quot;.

This record does not count games played behind closed doors by governmental authority. Games that were played as such included the April 29, 2015 game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Chicago White Sox at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, which was closed because of safety concerns surrounding the 2015 Baltimore protests, and the majority of the 2020 season (only the NLCS and World Series had spectators) which was closed to fans due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

==Highest and lowest season home totals, by team==

The following shows the highest and lowest season home totals by team since 1903, excluding the 1918, 1981, 2020, and 2021 seasons.
The highest per game attendance average is held by the Colorado Rockies in 1994 with 57,570 for 57 home games at Mile High Stadium during the strike shortened season.

The 1918 season is excluded as it was shortened due to travel restrictions caused by World War I.

The 1981 season is excluded due to the players&#x27; strike that cancelled almost two months&#x27; worth of games.

The 2020 and 2021 seasons are excluded due to the COVID-19 pandemic that caused restrictions on public gatherings.

==4 million or more home attendance totals==
Toronto Blue Jays became the first team in baseball history to draw 4 million mark in attendance in 1991 season.

He emigrated to British Columbia in 1859 in order to act as surveyor for the Dewdney Trail that runs through the province. In 1870, Dewdney decided to take up a role in Canadian government. In this year, he was elected to the Legislative Council of British Columbia as a representative from the Kootenay region. In 1872, he was elected as a Member of the Parliament of Canada for the Yale region representing the Conservative party. He was reelected to this position in 1874 and again in 1878. Dewdney served as Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories from 1879 to 1888, and the fifth Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia from 1892 to 1897. Additionally, he served as the Indian commissioner in the North-West Territories from 1879 until 1888. In 1897, Dewdney retired from politics and began working as a financial agent until his death in 1916.

Throughout his political career, Dewdney played a role in the settlement of western Canada and defining the relationship between the government of Canada and the Indigenous peoples of the North-West in the nineteenth century. Dewdney experienced several political and humanitarian issues throughout his political appointments. As Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, Dewdney had to manage with a starvation crisis faced by the Indigenous peoples after years of deliberate extermination of buffalo herds, promoted by the Government of Canada to force the Indigenous inhabitants off the land prior to its settlement. Additionally, as Indian Commissioner, Dewdney subsequently tackled issues pertaining to the North-West Rebellion of 1885.

==Early life and career==
Edgar Dewdney was born in Bideford, England to parents Charles Dewdney and Fanny Hollingshead. He grew up in a wealthy family, providing him with many social opportunities. Dewdney had two marriages, neither producing any children. The first marriage was to Jane Shaw Moir in 1864, and the second in 1909 to Blanche Elizabeth Plantagenet Kemeys-Tynte. Dewdney originally wanted to pursue a career in civil engineering, studying the subject at Cardiff University. After his civil engineering training in 1859, he decided to start a life in the Pacific northwest in hopes of making a fortune with his newly acquired qualifications. Dewdney was also motivated to move to the North-West Territories after the discovery and further mining of gold in the Fraser Valley. He was active in the development of pack trails in the colony of British Columbia including the Dewdney Trail which became the main trail into the interior of the colony.

Dewdney was active in political life in British Columbia throughout the 1860s. Dewdney had a limited understanding of the functions of Canadian politics when his interests first piqued. After a few years in Provincial politics, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald requested Dewdney to become the Indian Commissioner in the North-West, as he knew of the “Indians” in the area quite well. Dewdney had an advantage due to his general knowledge of Indigenous peoples and that he did not originate from Ottawa. Later in his life, Dewdney held dual titles of Indian Commissioner and Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories. He was also the Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia and after three years retired and became a surveyor. Due to his prestigious career in politics, Dewdney was considered suitable to conduct the study and surveying of the Cascades. He discovered three routes, Allison, Coquihalla, and Railroad Passes in his 1902 exhibition. However, he disclosed that he never liked any of these routes due to their engineering difficulties. As a result, Dewdney suggested the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) should be built from Midway to Princeton, then north to Merritt and Spences Bridge, and have Fraser Canyon as the way through the Cascades. Dewdney is recognized as a legendary trail builder of colonial days in British Columbia, as this played a large role in the westward expansion of Canada. Despite this recognition, he faced issues regarding Canadian expansionism and the effect on Indigenous peoples.

===Surveyor during the gold rushes of the 1860s===

Dewdney was originally employed as a surveyor, and supervised the survey of New Westminster. In 1865, Dewdney was appointed by Governor Frederick Seymour to oversee the construction of a trail to the East Kootenay region of the British Columbia Interior so that coastal merchants might benefit from the burgeoning trade associated with gold mining in that area. This was also done to secure a line of communication within the region to prevent an American takeover of that part of the province. Although used for only a few years, parts of the Dewdney Trail, as it was known, remain to this day and are used for recreational hiking. Provincial Highway 3 largely follows the route of the Dewdney Trail.

==Entry into politics==
From 1868 to 1869, Dewdney became active in Colonial politics, representing the electoral district of Kootenay in the Legislative Council of British Columbia. After the colony joined Canadian Confederation in 1871, he served as a Conservative Member of Parliament for the riding of Yale following his election in 1872. He was appointed a member of Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald&#x27;s cabinet in 1879, where he served as Indian commissioner for the North-West Territories until 1888.

In 1881, Macdonald arranged Dewdney&#x27;s appointment as Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, then an executive position. Dewdney resigned his seat in the Commons, but remained Indian Commissioner during his term as Lieutenant-Governor, which lasted until 1888. Macdonald, along with being Prime Minister, held the cabinet post Minister of the Interior. Dewdney took orders directly from Macdonald. Responsible government had not been granted to the North-West Territories, so Dewdney was the Territories&#x27; head of government. Perhaps his most notable decision in office was changing the territorial capital from Battleford to Wascana Cree for &quot;Pile of Bones&quot; in 1883: a featureless location without water apart from a short spring run-off Wascana Creek, trees or topography. This is where Dewdney had secured a substantial real estate for himself adjacent to the near-future planned Canadian Pacific Railway line. Other townsites were also considered probable territorial capitals, including Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle and Qu&#x27;Appelle, the latter to the extent of having been designated the cathedral city of the new Diocese of Qu&#x27;Appelle by the Church of England in Canada. The matter was a national scandal at the time. Still, the initial major street of Pile of Bones, later renamed Regina by Princess Louise, Marchioness of Lorne, was called Dewdney Avenue.
After his term as Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, Dewdney was again elected to Parliament and served as the member for Assiniboia East (now southeastern Saskatchewan) from 1888 to 1891. During this period he also served as Minister of the Interior and Superintendent of Indian Affairs.

In 1892, he was appointed to the non-executive viceregal post of Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia. He served in this post until 1897.

He retired from politics in 1900, after unsuccessfully running for Parliament in New Westminster, British Columbia.

In 1909, following the death his wife Jane, Dewdney remarried. His newlywed wife was Blanche Kemeys-Tynte, the daughter of Colonel Charles John Kemeys-Tynte of Halswell, Somerset, England.

==Crisis: The starvation of the Indians==

Upon taking office in May, 1879, Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories Edgar Dewdney came face to face with the plight of the natives in the wake of the disappearing buffalo. The mass extermination of buffalo, encouraged by the Government as an important step to depopulating the land and permitted its settlement, had had its intended effect on the Indigenous peoples who relied completely on every aspect of the buffalo for food, clothing and resources for housing. Indigenous peoples had already starved to death at Qu&#x27;Appele, Fort Walsh, Fort Macleod, Battleford, Carlton, Fort Pitt, Fort Saskatchewan, Edmonton, Touchwood Hills, Fort Ellice, Moose Mountain, Fort Calgary, and elsewhere. Dewdney&#x27;s solution was to locate the native tribes on reserves. Their agents would teach them how to farm.

He reported conditions at the Blackfoot Crossing in July 1879 as follows:

By that autumn, seventeen instructors were established at different reserves along with supplies of tools and seed. They began to teach the natives how to farm.

Dewdney was later denounced for not responding to four official requests for food aid during the winter of 1882-83 for &quot;over 2000 Indians here almost naked and on the verge of starvation&quot;. When finally pressed to send food supplies after the official requests, Dewdney stated it was government policy to use famine to force Indians onto reserves.

The Report of the Royal Commission to Inquire into Changes Affecting the Administration of Justice in the North-West Territories was conducted by Dewdney in 1880 regarding the administration of Indian Affairs. This communication was written to the Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs in Ottawa and provided insight into conditions in the North-West. This report was controversial because it only provided a colonial viewpoint into the lives of Indigenous peoples. The Indigenous voice was omitted from the report, making the report biased to colonial views. Dewdney outlined in the report that the “scarcity of buffalo in Fort Walsh had not been exaggerated, and numbers of Indians of the Cree, Assiniboine and Blackfeet were awaiting the arrival of Col. MacLeod and myself.” The decline of the buffalo populations created a famine which “reduced the Indians to a state of dependence on government relief supplies and even forced the Indians to seek government on their reserves.” In order to resolve the starvation crisis, Dewdney proposed relocating all Indigenous peoples in the region onto reserves. Because of the scarcity in buffalo populations, the government had no other choice but to provide Indigenous peoples on reserves with food rations, distributed by the North-West Mounted Police.

Due to the high decline in the buffalo population, many Indigenous communities were facing starvation. Changes needed to be made in regards to the government’s actions in controlling and alleviating the threat of a starvation crisis. Dewdney traveled to parts of the north-west with Col. James Macleod, the Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police, in response to the threat of a starvation crisis. Before traveling to Blackfoot Crossing, Macleod stated in Fort Walk that the resolution to the buffalo problem and the starvation of the Indigenous peoples was to promote an agricultural lifestyle rather than one based on the reliance on buffalo. After observing the crisis at Blackfoot Crossing, Dewdney stressed that the Indigenous peoples there should work to relieve themselves of starvation that resulted from the disappearance of buffalo. He proposed stationing instructors on reserves in order to educate the Indigenous peoples on how to sustain an agricultural society, as well as to provide those on reserves with the necessary supplies. The Royal Commission shows that members of the Blackfoot nation were grateful for Dewdney’s efforts made to ending the crisis. Both members of government in Ottawa and Dewdney believed that the Blackfoot Crossing could be a prosperous agricultural settlement. Upon arriving to Blackfoot, Dewdney hoped to talk about this possible prosperity but before his arrival, he had received news that a number of buffalo had crossed through the settlement and destroyed the crops.

In the early 1880s, government officials such as Dewdney withheld rations from Indigenous people as a tool to bring them into submission. From 1881 to 1883, it was recorded that buffalo and buffalo herds were headed towards Fort Walsh. Upon hearing this, Dewdney ordered that the food rations for Fort Walsh be reduced. The North-West Mounted Police began preparation to abandon their post at the fort, which meant Indigenous peoples could only receive their treaty payments and other assistance if or when they signed the treaty and moved north. Dewdney&#x27;s refusal to allow the supply of relief to Indigenous communities created a volatile environment. In October 1882, reports from Augustus Jukes, senior surgeon for the North-West Mounted Police, regarding the limited food and lack of shelter did not have an effect on Dewdney. As a result, Fort Walsh closed in 1882 which left many Indigenous people starved, unless they signed Treaty One or Treaty Two. Dewdney said that he would recognize any male Cree as a chief if he could get the support of one hundred or more men to accept him as a leader. As a result, many Metis, Cree and Assiniboine separated from their bands in order to receive the promised rations from the government.

In 1882, it was reported that Cree and Assiniboine that settled in the Cypress Hills were supplied with minimal food rations. As a result, many Cree and Assiniboine began travelling to Indian Head. However, many died along the journey as a result of starvation. The reserve in Indian Head was called Win-cha-pa-ghen, or Skull Mountainettes, because the mountains were covered with the victims of the starvation crisis who received little aid from the government of Canada. In the spring, many made the journey back to the Cypress Hills, where Augustus Juke reported that many of the Cree and Assiniboine were in a state of starvation and did not have the basic necessities of life. This was the direct result of the Indian Commissioner’s insistence on letting them starve unless they complied with the government&#x27;s request for them to sign treaties. Dewdney was quoted saying “the longer they continue to act against the wishes of the Government, the more wretched will they become.”

In 1884, tensions between Louis Riel and the government were rising. Charles Borromée, the Justice of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories and legal advisor in the North-West Territories, sent a letter to Edgar Dewdney on September 5, 1884, regarding the conditions of Indigenous communities during the North-West Rebellion. Borromée wrote “Riel can harm the country, and that the government must come to the assistance of the Indians or misery and starvation will result.” Dewdney ultimately ignored this information, allowing the half breed (Metis) to starve.

In 1886, Dewdney described the state’s initiatives to provide rations to Indigenous communities as a “policy of reward and punishment,” implying that only bands deemed as “loyal” would receive rations, livestock, and other farming equipment. To help promote an agricultural society within Indigenous communities, treaties stipulated that farming supplies would be made available as well as livestock. Dewdney believed that one of the reasons Indigenous people could not become self supporting was due to the treaties failing to provide grist mills for grain farming. Dewdney, as Indian Commissioner, noted that there were insufficient resources and supplies despite the terms of the treaties. The government of Canada promoted self sufficiency in agriculture by Indigenous peoples as a way to offset the cost of famine relief from the government. However, the supplies that would help Indigenous peoples on reserves to create an agricultural based community were lacking. The lack of supplies from the government frustrated many. The starvation crisis would symbolize the defining issue during Edgar Dewdney’s tenure as Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories. The Crisis regarding the starvation of the natives is still seen as a major political and humanitarian crisis.

==Northwest Rebellion of 1885==

The North-West Rebellion of 1885 was an uprising led by the Metis and other Indigenous peoples of the North-West Territories against the Canadian government. The Metis felt threatened by the continuous buying and selling of land by the Canadian government. There was the question of whether the Metis would receive the land that they were entitled to, while the government continued to give more land to settlers. This, in conjunction with the decline in buffalo in the region and the lack of government relief, resulted in the North-West rebellion. The North-West Rebellion began as a peaceful protest by the Metis against the lack of government relief. The reinforcement of the North-West Mounted Police to the area was seen as a threat to the Metis, and helped to jumpstart violence between the Metis and the government. The violent altercation lasted for five months, with the eventual defeat of the Metis rebels by federal enforcers.

Edgar Dewdney was the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories during the Riel-led rebellion of 1885. It is clear that there were many issues in the North-West region prior to the outbreak of the Metis rebellion. The North-West Mounted Police Superintendent L.N.F. Crozier acted as an informant for Dewdney in the events leading up to the outbreak of the rebellion. With the information that he had gathered, Dewdney believed that he could maintain peace within the region and that he had control of the situation. However, he did not have faith in the ability of Indian agents across the region to maintain and control the unrest that was beginning to arise within Indigenous communities. As a result, Dewdney called for the appointment of a second roving inspector in 1885, as he believed that it would be difficult for one man to do the job effectively over a vast amount of territory, as well as the fact that the current roving inspector T.P. Wadsworth was reporting his findings to other officials behind Dewdney’s back. Since his arrival in the North-West Territories, Dewdney supported the increase of rations for Indigenous communities and believed that it was crucial that the terms outlined in treaties were met in order to maintain peace between the Metis and colonial settlers.

=== Land ===
The issue regarding Metis land claims and entitlement had been a topic of discussion for many years prior to the outbreak of rebellion. Louis Riel’s return to Canada caught the attention of the Canadian government, which motivated the efforts of communities along the Saskatchewan River to advance political demands. The Federal Government was not willing to negotiate with the Metis on the matter. Metis leader, Louis Riel and the Metis forwarded their demands to Ottawa in 1884. Dewdney, as Lieutenant Governor, stated that the government would investigate the claims of those who did not receive land or script in Manitoba, but made no other promises. Riel wanted “land titles and government by the people” instead of Dewdney holding absolute power in the region. The issue had been brought up to Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald many times, but had always been pushed aside to prioritize other issues occurring within the dominion. Many settlers in the region were becoming anxious and feared the outbreak of a rebellion, so in February 1885, Dewdney urged the Prime Minister to respond to their demands from the Metis. This request was once again ignored. Later that month, officials in Saskatchewan began sending reports to Dewdney regarding Metis military action that had begun in the area. It had been reported that the Metis had obtained weapons and ammunition from colonial traders, which was considered illegal. This was alarming for Dewdney, who believed that action needed to be taken to control the Metis and suppress tensions. As a result, Dewdney prepared to send police to the area if conditions worsened. When Riel and his followers began to take prisoners and recruit support from individuals on nearby reserves, Dewdney allowed one hundred Mounted Police to intervene. Dewdney was devoted to preventing other Indigenous peoples on reserves from joining Riel in the North-West Rebellion as an attempt to keep settlers in the area at ease. Land was prioritized by Riel and the Metis in order to secure their future prosperity and survival in the area. Their demands were not recognized by the government of Canada and prompted some Metis communities to prepare for military action.

=== Rations used as means of control===
Land and food were important tools used by the government of Canada to control Indigenous peoples. Therefore, land and food were key motivators in the resistance. Prior to the outbreak of the rebellion, Dewdney was unwilling to provide large amounts of rations to Metis settlements unless they were in extreme desperation. This mindset changed during the rebellion, as Dewdney’s idea was to “tempt” Metis and other Indigenous peoples to remain on their reserve and remain devoted to the dominion by offering them more rations and goods. When violence broke out between Riel and the government, Dewdney conducted a tour of reserves in the area, listening to the specific needs of the individuals living on the reserves in an attempt to keep them content. Dewdney offered them more rations of tobacco, bacon, flour, and tea. This was done to keep the Indigenous people on the reserve loyal to the state and separated from the rebellious Metis. Dewdney maintained this appeasement strategy throughout the rebellion. He emphasized the need to be loyal to the state throughout the rebellion. Dewdney suggested that rations and other goods should be withheld from “rebel Indians” after the North-West Rebellion had ended, until it was decided how justice could be achieved. Dewdney believed that those who had been loyal to the state should be rewarded after the North-West Rebellion had ended. These individuals were awarded through the distribution of money and livestock.

The North-West Rebellion can be linked to the starvation crisis, which is represented in the Frog Lake Massacre. The Frog Lake Massacre on April 2, 1885, was due to the restlessness of the Native people in the area of Frog Lake due to the lack of food and resources. Theresa Delaney, a settler who was held captive whose husband was shot in Frog Lake believed that Edgar Dewdney should be blamed as a cause for the massacre in that while visiting Frog Lake, Dewdney made many promises in regards to food and aid, but none of the promises were fulfilled. Although the massacre cannot be directly linked to Dewdney’s unfulfilled promises to the Indigenous peoples of Frog Lake, it is clear that the lack of government intervention at a time of crisis worsened the conditions. Due to the lack of resources, aid, and food provided to those in the region, it is clear that the residents of Frog Lake were living in unjust circumstances. Additionally, Dewdney acted as a mediator between the government and the Indigenous peoples of Frog Lake.

=== Result of the rebellion ===
The North-West Rebellion eventually ended on June 3, 1885, with subsequent consequences and as well as solutions to ensure there would be no repetition of violence. After the North-West Rebellion had ended, Dewdney took actions to improve the level of security on reserves. This was done to prevent another rebellion of the same nature from occurring in the region. Dewdney believed that all of those who were involved in the North-West Rebellion should be sentenced accordingly. He supported heavy jail sentences for the perpetrators and believed that many executions needed to be carried out in order to make a statement, including the execution of Louis Riel. Dewdney believed that the future of Indigenous communities lay in the younger generation. He feared Indigenous children and the power that they held. This was one of the arguments that justified his support the closing of day schools and the creation of Indian residential schools in order to fully transform Indigenous children into model citizens. He believed that children needed to be removed from the influence of their Indigenous parents and communities. This needed to be done in order to maintain control and ensure that another rebellion of similar nature did not occur. The failure of the North-West Rebellion caused the government of Canada to impose other regulations on the lives of individuals, such as Indian residential schools. The intended purpose of Indian residential schools were to isolate Indigenous children from the influences of their family in order to effectively assimilate them into Euro- Canadian society. These schools operated within Canada until 1996. They were opened and funded by the Canadian government and were operated by the Catholic church. At these schools, Indigenous children faced extreme physical, emotional, and sexual abuse as an assimilation tactic. The traumatization that Indigenous children faced at these schools has been passed down through generations and continues to have an extremely negative effect on Indigenous communities in the twenty-first century.

==Honours==
Dewdney had the prenominal &quot;the Honourable&quot; and the postnominal &quot;PC&quot; for life by virtue of being made a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada on September 25, 1888.

== Indigenous relations ==
Settler expansion westward further strained Indigenous and Crown relations. Metis and Indigenous peoples were affected by the increase in westward expansion and the methods of land settlement imposed by the government in Qu’Appelle and Saskatchewan. The Metis distrusted Dewdney due to his control over the land in question for settlement. New settlers arriving in the region began to push Metis out of Manitoba. The uncertainty regarding the fate of the Metis in Manitoba in regards to settler migration became a reality. Surveying of Metis land for the new settlers created new tensions, which Dewdney failed to acknowledge. There are some instances of Dewdney mediating territorial disputes as Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs, and while travelling the areas affected by the starvation crisis in 1879. He noted in the Royal Commission that the Sacree nation was in dispute with the Blackfeet over flour rations. The Sacree were forced to travel to Fort MacLeod in order to avoid further trauma caused by starvation, but voiced concern over the area also being inhabited by the Blackfeet. Dewdney ended the dispute and the Sacree agreed to move to Fort MacLeod. Dewdney was involved in mediating the territorial disputes between the Metis and settlers when tensions were heightened.

The early 1880s saw raids led by Indigenous bands to steal cattle and horses from ranchers. This is directly linked to the loss of buffalo in the area and the subsequent starvation crisis. These raids occurred across into the United States and created American tensions. As a Result, Dewdney created a permit system in 1882 so that groups such as the Blackfeet and Assiniboine could move across the border to hunt, visit relatives, and for leisure. Dewdney supported and defended the allegations against Canadian Indigenous peoples as being held responsible for the depredations in Northern Montana. Rancher anxieties and prompts from Americans due to raids by Indigenous peoples pushed Dewdney to move Indigenous bands “from the southern prairies of Assiniboia to reserves north of the Canadian Pacific Railroad.” This plan disrupted bands searching and following remaining buffalo across the international boundary. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were instructed to use force when faced with bands attempting to move north. Dewdney triumphantly claimed that there were no more natives north of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) line. As a result, the development of the CPR could continue further west by the instruction of Dewdney.

Concerning governance, Dewdney advocated for the enforcement of the Indian Act to dispose Indian chiefs. This would help the colonial government maintain power in local communities by removing Indigenous leadership and eradicating self-governance. As a result of this enforcement, arrests were made against those who were viewed as ‘bad Indians.’ The use of language such as ‘bad Indians’ left for interpretation that any Metis or Indigenous person that rejected government policy was atrocious. Additionally, Dewdney mediated territorial disputes as Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs while traveling areas affected by colonial expansion as well as food and land disputes.

== Criticism ==
Dewdney has been criticized for using the courts as an extension of administering his own concept of justice. He reportedly withheld rations from the Cree until he realized that it created more violence among them.

Dewdney was known for making many promises to the Indigenous peoples which raised their morale, but ultimately leaving these promises unfulfilled. At the time of the North-West Rebellion, Dewdney was Indian Commissioner as well as Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories. This gave him a great deal of power and influence in the area and created criticism towards him, as many believe that he was able to abuse this power to ultimately achieve his goals. Dewdney was criticized for not responding to requests for food relief made to the government by Metis, Assiniboine and Cree in the winter of 1882 to 1883. The lack of a response from Dewdney in regard to official requests for food supplies to Indigenous communities can be seen as a tactic used in order to push Indigenous peoples onto reserves.

Additionally, there was concern that the Department of Indian Affairs, its agents, and Dewdney had secretly been in contact with Montana grocery and mercantile firm I.G. Baker Company. The worry was that the Department had purchased subpar goods to distribute to the Metis who were affected by the starvation crisis. It was claimed by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company That Dewdney and other key officials in the North-West and Ottawa were linked with the company and therefore profiting off of the starvation crisis. Dewdney&#x27;s relationship with the Baker Co. relates back to before his appointment as Indian Commissioner. Dewdney was known to involve himself in various business ventures and investments in the North-West that resulted in his personal financial gain. Flour supplied to Indigenous communities by the Baker Company was unfit for consumption and caused deaths in several reserves. Additionally, there was the belief that the food had been tampered with which created a formal independent investigation into the Baker Company’s flour supply. It was determined that the flour was indeed substandard, which reflected negatively on Dewdney given his relationship with the Company.

Furthermore, there are also reports that Dewdney and other agents from the Department of Indian Affairs used food as a tool for coercion. Many Indigenous people on reserves were at the mercy of these agents.

== Life after the rebellion ==
It is important to note that Dewdney never truly liked living in the North-West Territories, as he saw the land as bleak and lifeless. He also disliked the harsh climate of the North-West Territories, as it could become intolerable at times. Dewdney suffered from extreme back pain, preventing him from traveling on horseback and camping between reserves. Dewdney’s wife Jane also expressed a longing to return to life in British Columbia, as it was filled with excitement and adventure. After the North-West Rebellion, Dewdney requested political appointments outside of the North-West. On September 12, 1888, he was named Minister of the Interior as well as superintendent general of Indian Affairs. Dewdney was appointed as Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia on November 2, 1892, and retired December 1, 1897. After his retirement from politics, Dewdney focused on business ventures. Throughout his life, Dewdney managed his personal finances poorly, resulting in his lack of pension to support him in his later life. Subsequently, he also focused on surveying projects for proposed railways in British Columbia. His wife Jane died in January 1909, which prompted his second marriage to Blanche Elizabeth Plantagenet Kemeys-Tynte in 1909. Money continued to be an issue for Dewdney up until his death. He attempted to receive a senate appointment as well as an appeal to receive a pension to aid him in his old age. He never received a senate appointment or a pension. Edgar Dewdney died on August 8, 1916, in Victoria, British Columbia, at the age of eighty.

==Legacy==
*A major east-west street in Regina, Dewdney Avenue, is named after him; Government House, the original Territorial government building and the local detachment of the RCMP (formerly its headquarters before these were transferred to Ottawa) and national training centre are on Dewdney Avenue.
*Dewdney, British Columbia, is the name of a locality immediately east of Mission, British Columbia, located below the 920 m Dewdney Peak on the north shore of the Fraser River. The community was the namesake of the former Dewdney provincial electoral district and also of the now-dismantled Dewdney-Alouette Regional District
*The Dewdney Trunk Road was one of the earliest main roads in the Lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia, running from Port Moody to the community of Dewdney. Today it exists in sections in Coquitlam and Port Coquitlam and is a major thoroughfare running between Maple Ridge and Mission, ending short of Dewdney in the community of Hatzic.
*The Last Mountain Lake Bird Sanctuary in Saskatchewan, established in 1887 upon Dewdney&#x27;s recommendation and the first wildlife reserve of its type on the continent, was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1987.

<doc id="522829" wikidata="Q1129307" url="?curid=522829" title="Convair F2Y Sea Dart">
<text>The Convair F2Y Sea Dart is an American seaplane fighter aircraft that rode on twin hydro-skis during takeoff and landing. It flew only as a prototype, and never entered mass production. It is the only seaplane to have exceeded the speed of sound.

It was created in the 1950s, to overcome the problems with supersonic planes taking off and landing on aircraft carriers. The program was canceled after a series of unsatisfactory results and a tragic accident on 4 November 1954, in which test pilot Charles E. Richbourg was killed when the Sea Dart he was piloting disintegrated in midair. The four surviving planes were retired in 1957, but some were kept in reserve until 1962.

==Development==
The Sea Dart began as Convair&#x27;s entry in a 1948 U.S. Navy contest for a supersonic interceptor aircraft. At the time, there was much skepticism about operating supersonic aircraft from carrier decks. In order to address this issue, the U.S. Navy ordered many subsonic fighters. The worry had some foundation, since many supersonic designs of the time required long takeoff rolls, had high approach speeds, and were not very stable or easy to control—all factors that were troublesome on a carrier.

Ernest Stout&#x27;s team at Convair&#x27;s hydrodynamic research laboratory proposed to put a Delta Dagger on water skis.

Convair&#x27;s proposal gained an order for two prototypes in late 1951. Twelve production aircraft were ordered before a prototype had even flown. No armament was ever fitted to any Sea Dart built, but the plan was to arm the production aircraft with four 20mm Colt Mk12 cannon and a battery of folding-fin unguided rockets. Four of this order were redesignated as service test vehicles, and an additional eight production aircraft were soon ordered as well.

==Design==
The aircraft was to be a delta-winged fighter with a watertight hull and twin retractable hydro-skis for takeoff and landing. When stationary or moving slowly in the water, the Sea Dart floated with the trailing edge of the wings touching the water. The skis were not extended until the aircraft reached about per hour during its takeoff run.

The required power was supplied by a pair of afterburning Westinghouse XJ46-WE-02 turbojets, fed from intakes mounted high above the wings to avoid ingesting spray. When these engines were not ready for the prototypes, twin Westinghouse J34-WE-32 engines of just over half the power were installed.

===Ski configurations===

The prototype was fitted with an experimental single ski, which proved more successful than the twin-ski design of the second service test aircraft. Testing with several other experimental ski configurations continued with the prototype through 1957, after which it was placed into storage.

The US was not the only country to consider the hydroski. The Saunders-Roe company of the United Kingdom, which had already built an experimental flying boat jet fighter, first flying in 1947 the SR.A/1, tendered a design for a ski-equipped fighter, but little came of it.

===Submarine carriage===
In the 1950s, the US Navy considered the internal arrangements of a submarine aircraft carrier that could carry three of these aircraft. Stored in pressure chambers that would not protrude from the hull, they would be raised by a portside elevator just aft of the sail and set to take off on their own on a smooth sea but catapulted aft in a higher sea. The program only reached the &quot;writing on a napkin&quot; stage, for two problems were not addressed: the hole for the elevator would have seriously weakened the hull and the load of a laden elevator would also be difficult to transmit to the hull structure.

==Operational history==
The aircraft was built in Convair&#x27;s San Diego facility at Lindbergh Field and was taken to San Diego Bay for testing in December 1952. On 14 January 1953, with E. D. &quot;Sam&quot; Shannon at the controls, the aircraft inadvertently made its first short flight during what was supposed to be a fast taxi run; its official maiden flight was on 9 April.

The underpowered engines made the fighter sluggish, and the hydro-skis were not as successful as hoped; they created violent vibration during takeoff and landing, despite the shock-absorbing oleo legs they were extended on. Work on the skis and legs improved this situation somewhat, but they were unable to resolve the sluggish performance. The Sea Dart proved incapable of supersonic speed in level flight with the J34 engines; not helping was its pre-area rule shape, which meant higher transonic drag.

The second prototype was canceled, so the first service test aircraft was built and flown. This was fitted with the J46 engines, which performed below specification. However, speeds in excess of Mach 1 were attained in a shallow dive with this aircraft, making it the only supersonic seaplane to date. On 4 November 1954, Sea Dart BuNo &quot;135762&quot; disintegrated in midair over San Diego Bay during a demonstration for naval officials and the press, killing Convair test pilot Charles E. Richbourg when he inadvertently exceeded the airframe&#x27;s limitations.

Even before that, the Navy had been losing interest (problems with supersonic fighters on carrier decks having been overcome) and the crash relegated the Sea Dart program to experimental status. All production aircraft were cancelled, though the remaining three service test examples were completed. The two final prototypes never flew.

===Redesignation===
Despite the fact that the airplane was officially retired and had not flown since 1957, at least one F2Y was still in storage as of 1962. As a result, it was redesignated YF-7A under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system.

<text>Naegleriasis, also known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), is an almost invariably fatal infection of the brain by the free-living protozoan &quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot;. Symptoms include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, a stiff neck, confusion, hallucinations and seizures. Symptoms progress rapidly over around five days with characteristics of both meningitis and encephalitis, making it a type of meningoencephalitis. Death usually results within one to two weeks of symptom onset.
&quot;N. fowleri&quot; is typically found in warm bodies of fresh water, such as ponds, lakes, rivers and hot springs. It is found in an amoeboid, temporary flagellate stage or microbial cyst in soil, poorly maintained municipal water supplies, water heaters, near warm-water discharges of industrial plants and in poorly chlorinated or unchlorinated swimming pools. There is no evidence of it living in salt water. As the disease is rare, it is often not considered during diagnosis.
Although infection occurs very rarely, it almost inevitably results in death.

==Signs and symptoms==
Onset of symptoms begins one to twelve days following exposure (with a median of five). Initial symptoms include changes in taste and smell, headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, back pain, and a stiff neck. Secondary symptoms are also meningitis-like including confusion, hallucinations, lack of attention, ataxia, cramp and seizures. After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly, with death usually occurring anywhere from one to eighteen days later (with a median of five), although it can take longer. In 2013, a man in Taiwan died 25 days after being infected by &quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot;.

It affects healthy children or young adults who have recently been exposed to bodies of fresh water. Scientists speculate that lower age groups are at a higher risk of contracting the disease because adolescents have a more underdeveloped and porous cribriform plate, through which the amoeba travels to reach the brain.

==Cause==
&quot;N. fowleri&quot; invades the central nervous system via the nose, specifically through the olfactory mucosa of the nasal tissues. This usually occurs as the result of the introduction of water that has been contaminated with &quot;N. fowleri&quot; into the nose during activities such as swimming, bathing or nasal irrigation.

The amoeba follows the olfactory nerve fibers through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone into the skull. There, it migrates to the olfactory bulbs and subsequently other regions of the brain, where it feeds on the nerve tissue. The organism then begins to consume cells of the brain, piecemeal through trogocytosis, by means of an &quot;amoebostome&quot;, a unique actin-rich sucking apparatus extended from its cell surface. It then becomes pathogenic, causing primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM or PAME).

Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis presents symptoms similar to those of relatively common bacterial and viral meningitis. Upon abrupt disease onset, a plethora of symptoms arise. Endogenous cytokines, released in response to the pathogens, affect the thermoregulatory neurons of the hypothalamus causing a rise in body temperature. Additionally, the cytokines may act on the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, leading to upregulation of Prostaglandin E2 contributing to hyperthermia. Further, the release of cytokines, exotoxins released by the pathogens and an increase in intracranial pressure stimulate the nociceptors in the meninges resulting in pain sensations.

The release of cytotoxic molecules in the central nervous system leads to extensive tissue damage and necrosis, such as damage to the olfactory nerve through lysis of nerve cells and demyelination. Specifically, the olfactory nerve and bulbs become necrotic and hemorrhagic. Spinal flexion leads to nuchal rigidity, or stiff neck, due to the stretching of the inflamed meninges. The increase in intracranial pressure stimulates the area postrema to create nausea sensations which may lead to brain herniation and damage to the reticular formation. Ultimately, the increase in cerebrospinal fluid from inflammation of the meninges increases intracranial pressure to an extent which leads to the destruction of the central nervous system. Although the exact pathophysiology behind the seizures caused by PAM is unknown, it is speculated that the seizures arise from altered meningeal permeability caused by increased intracranial pressure.

==Pathogenesis==
&quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot; propagates in warm, stagnant bodies of fresh water (typically during the summer months), and enters the central nervous system after insufflation of infected water by attaching itself to the olfactory nerve. It then migrates through the cribriform plate and into the olfactory bulbs of the forebrain, where it rapidly multiplies by feeding on nerve tissue.

==Diagnosis==
&quot;N. fowleri&quot; can be grown in several kinds of liquid axenic media or on non-nutrient agar plates coated with bacteria. &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; can be used to overlay the non-nutrient agar plate and a drop of cerebrospinal fluid sediment is added to it. Plates are then incubated at 37 °C and checked daily for clearing of the agar in thin tracks, which indicate the trophozoites have fed on the bacteria.

Detection in water is performed by centrifuging a water sample with &quot;E. coli&quot; added, then applying the pellet to a non-nutrient agar plate. After several days, the plate is microscopically inspected and &quot;Naegleria&quot; cysts are identified by their morphology. Final confirmation of the species&#x27; identity can be performed by various molecular or biochemical methods.

Confirmation of &quot;Naegleria&quot; presence can be done by a so-called flagellation test, where the organism is exposed to a hypotonic environment (distilled water). &quot;Naegleria&quot;, in contrast to other amoebae, differentiates within two hours into the flagellate state. Pathogenicity can be further confirmed by exposure to high temperature (42 °C): &quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot; is able to grow at this temperature, but the nonpathogenic &quot;Naegleria gruberi&quot; is not.

==Prevention==
Michael Beach, a recreational waterborne illness specialist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stated in remarks to the Associated Press that wearing of nose clips to prevent insufflation of contaminated water would be effective protection against contracting PAM, noting that &quot;You&#x27;d have to have water going way up in your nose to begin with&quot;.

Advice stated in the press release from Taiwan&#x27;s Centers for Disease Control recommended people prevent fresh water from entering the nostrils and avoid putting their heads down into fresh water or stirring mud in the water with feet. When starting to suffer from fever, headache, nausea, or vomiting subsequent to any kind of exposure to fresh water, even in the belief that no fresh water has traveled through the nostrils, people with such conditions should be carried to hospital quickly and make sure doctors are well-informed about the history of exposure to fresh water.

==Treatment==
On the basis of laboratory evidence and case reports, heroic doses of amphotericin B have been the traditional mainstay of PAM treatment since the first reported survivor in the United States in 1982.

Treatment has often also used combination therapy with multiple other antimicrobials in addition to amphotericin, such as fluconazole, miconazole, rifampicin and azithromycin. They have shown limited success only when administered early in the course of an infection.

While the use of rifampicin has been common, including in all four North American cases of survival, its continued use has been questioned. It only has variable activity &quot;in vitro&quot; and it has strong effects on the therapeutic levels of other antimicrobials used by inducing cytochrome p450 pathways. Fluconazole is commonly used as it has been shown to have synergistic effects against naegleria when used with amphotericin &quot;in vitro&quot;.

In 2013–2016, three successfully treated cases in the United States utilized the medication miltefosine. In one of the cases, a 12-year-old female, was given miltefosine and targeted temperature management to manage cerebral edema which is secondary to the infection. She survived with no neurological damage. The targeted temperature management coupled with early diagnosis and the medication has been attributed with her survival. On the other hand, another survivor, an 8-year-old male, was diagnosed several days after symptoms appeared and was not treated with targeted temperature management although he was administered miltefosine. He suffered apparent permanent neurological damage. In 2016, a 16-year-old male also survived PAM. He was treated with the same protocols as of the 12-year-old female in 2013. He recovered with a near-complete neurological recovery; however, the patient has mentioned difficulties with learning post-recovery.
 the U.S. CDC offered miltefosine to doctors for the treatment of diseases caused by free-living amoebas including &quot;Naegleria&quot;, despite a lack of any data on how well the drug reaches the central nervous system.

In 2018, a 10-year-old girl in the Spanish city of Toledo became the first person to contract the disease in Spain, and was successfully treated using intravenous and intrathecal amphotericin B.

A 2023 study on mice has showed that treatment that included a derivative of the drug acoziborole known as AN3057 significantly prolonged survival and showed a 28% recovery rate without relapse.

==Prognosis==

Since its first description in the 1960s, only seven people worldwide have been reported to have survived PAM out of 450 cases diagnosed, implying a fatality rate of about 98.5%. The survivors include four in the United States, one in Mexico and one in Spain. One of the US survivors had brain damage that is likely permanent, but there are two documented surviving cases in the United States who made a full recovery with no neurological damage; they were both treated with the same protocols.

There is also a fourth survivor in the United States. However, he had a different strain.

==Epidemiology==
The disease is rare and highly lethal: there had only been 381 cases Drug treatment research at Aga Khan University in Pakistan has shown that &quot;in vitro&quot; drug susceptibility tests with some FDA approved drugs used for non-infectious diseases (digoxin and procyclidine were shown to be most effective of the drugs studied) have proved to kill &quot;Naegleria&quot; &quot;fowleri&quot; with an amoebicidal rate greater than 95%. The same source has also proposed a device for drug delivery via the transcranial route to the brain.

In the US, the most common states with cases reported of PAM from &quot;N. fowleri&quot; are the southern states, with Texas and Florida having the highest prevalence. The most commonly affected age group is 5–14-year olds (those who play in water). The number of cases of infection could increase due to climate change, which was posited as the reason for three cases in Minnesota in 2010, 2012, and 2015.

 the numbers of reported cases were expected to increase simply because of better-informed diagnoses being made both in ongoing cases and in autopsy findings.

==History==
In 1899, Franz Schardinger first discovered and documented an amoeba he called &quot;Amoeba gruberi&quot; that could transform into a flagellate. The genus &quot;Naegleria&quot; was established by Alexis Alexeieff in 1912, who grouped the flagellate amoeba. He coined the term &quot;Naegleria&quot; after Kurt Nägler, who researched amoebae. It was not until 1965 that doctors Malcolm Fowler and Rodney F. Carter in Adelaide, Australia, reported the first four-human cases of amoebic meningoencephalitis. These cases involved four Australian children, one in 1961 and the rest in 1965, all of whom had succumbed to the illness. Their work on amebo-flagellates has provided an example of how a protozoan can effectively live both freely in the environment, and in a human host.

In 1966, Butt termed the infection resulting from &quot;N. fowleri&quot; primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) to distinguish this central nervous system (CNS) invasion from other secondary invasions made by other amoebae such as &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;. A retrospective study determined the first documented case of PAM possibly occurred in Britain in 1909. In 1966, four cases were reported in the US. By 1968 the causative organism, previously thought to be a species of &quot;Hartmannella&quot;, was identified as a novel species of &quot;Naegleria&quot;. This same year, occurrence of sixteen cases over a period of three years (1962–1965) was reported in Ústí nad Labem, Czechoslovakia. In 1970, Carter named the species of amoeba &quot;N. fowleri&quot;, after Malcolm Fowler.

== Society and culture ==
&quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot; is also known as the &quot;brain-eating amoeba&quot;. This common name has also been applied to &quot;Balamuthia mandrillaris&quot;, causing some confusion between the two; &quot;Balamuthia mandrillaris&quot; is unrelated to &quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot;, and causes a different disease called granulomatous amoebic encephalitis. Unlike naegleriasis, which is usually seen in people with normal immune function, granulomatous amoebic encephalitis is usually seen in people with poor immune function, such as those with HIV/AIDS or leukemia.

Naegleriasis was the topic in Season 2 of the medical mystery drama &quot;House, M.D.&quot; in the two-part episode titled &quot;Euphoria&quot;. It is also the topic of the episode &quot;39 Differences&quot; of season 6 of &quot;The Good Doctor&quot;.

== Research ==
The U.S. National Institutes of Health budgeted $800,000 for research on the disease in 2016. Phenothiazines have been tested &quot;in vitro&quot; and in animal models of PAM. Improving case detection through increased awareness, reporting, and information about cases might enable earlier detection of infections, provide insight into the human or environmental determinants of infection, and allow improved assessment of treatment effectiveness.

<text>Élisabeth Félix (21 February 1821 – 3 January 1858), better known only as Mademoiselle or Madame Rachel or simply Rachel, was a French actress. She became a prominent figure in French society, and was the mistress of, among others, Napoleon III and Prince Napoléon, both nephews of Napoleon I, and of Alexandre Colonna-Walewski, the illegitimate son of Napoleon I. Efforts by newspapers to publish pictures of her on her deathbed led to the introduction of privacy rights into French law.

==Biography==

Rachel Félix was born as Elisa-Rachel Félix on 28 February 1821, in Mumpf, Rheinfelden, Aargau, to a family of Swiss Jewish background. Her father, Jacob Jacques Félix, was a peddler, and her mother, Esther Thérèse Hayer, was a Bohemian dealer in second-hand clothes. She had four sisters (Sophie-Sarah, Rébecca, Mélanie-Dinah, and Adélaïde &quot;Lia&quot;) and one brother, Raphaël.

As a child, Félix earned money singing and reciting in the streets. She arrived in Paris in 1830 intending to become an actress. She took elocution and singing lessons, eventually studying under the instruction of the musician Alexandre-Étienne Choron and Saint-Aulaire. She took dramatic arts classes and debuted in &quot;La Vendéenne&quot; in January 1837, at the Théâtre du Gymnase. Delestre-Poirson, the director, gave her the stage name Rachel, which she chose to retain in her private life as well.

Rachel was described as a very serious and committed student. She was admired for her intelligence, work ethic, diction, and ability to act. Auditioning in March 1838, she starred in Pierre Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Horace&quot; at the Théâtre-Français at the age of 17.

During this time, she began a liaison with Louis Véron, the former director of the Paris Opera, which became the subject of much gossip. During this time, from 1838 to 1842, she lived in a third-floor apartment in Paris&#x27;s Galerie Véro-Dodat.

Her fame spread throughout Europe after success in London in 1841, and she was often associated with the works of Racine, Voltaire, and Corneille. She toured Brussels, Berlin, and St. Petersburg.

Although French classical tragedy was no longer popular at the time Rachel entered the stage of Comédie-Française, she remained true to her classical roots, arousing audiences with a craving for the tragic style of writers like Corneille, Racine and Molière.

She created the title role in Eugène Scribe&#x27;s &quot;Adrienne Lecouvreur.&quot; Her acting style was characterized by clear diction and economy of gesture; she evoked a high demand for classical tragedy to remain on the stage. This represented a major change from the exaggerated style of those days, as society was beginning to demand the highly emotional, realistic, instinctual acting styles of the Romantics. Félix completely rejected the Romantic Drama movement happening in nineteenth-century France. She was best known for her portrayal of the title role in &quot;Phèdre&quot;.

Félix&#x27;s health declined after a long tour of Russia. Her efforts to remain successful and the constant flux of her relationships had weakened her. She had shown symptoms of tuberculosis as early as 1841, and died early in 1858 of the disease, aged 36, in Le Cannet, Alpes-Maritimes, France. She is interred at Père-Lachaise cemetery in Paris.

==Legacy==
Félix had two illegitimate sons; Alexandre-Antoine-Jean Colonna-Walewski with Count Alexandre Colonna-Walewski (illegitimate son of Napoleon I and Marie Walewska), and Gabriel-Victor Bertrand with Arthur Bertrand (son of Henri Gatien Bertrand).

Upon her deathbed, she wrote many farewell letters to her sons, family members, lovers, colleagues and theatre connections at Comédie-Française. She is buried in a mausoleum in the Jewish part of Père Lachaise Cemetery and in Paris was named after her.

The English theatre critic James Agate published a biography of her in 1928.

A modern account of her life and legacy by Rachel Brownstein was published in 1995.

The character &quot;Vashti&quot; in Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s novel &quot;Villette&quot; was reportedly based on Félix, whom Brontë had seen perform in London.

&quot;Rachel&quot;, a light tannish colour, primarily for face-powder used in artificial light, is named after her. The Raschel lace-making machine was also named after her.

<doc id="522846" wikidata="Q2468139" url="?curid=522846" title="Langar (Sikhism)">
<text>In Sikhism, a langar (, pronunciation: , &#x27;kitchen&#x27;) is the community kitchen of a gurdwara, which serves meals to all free of charge, regardless of religion, caste, gender, economic status, or ethnicity. People sit on the floor and eat together, and the kitchen is maintained and serviced by Sikh community volunteers who are doing &quot;seva&quot; (&quot;selfless services&quot;). The meals served at a langar are always lacto-vegetarian.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Langar&quot; is a Persian word that was eventually incorporated into the Punjabi language and lexicon.

==Origins==

The concept of charity and providing cooked meals or uncooked raw material to ascetics and wandering yogis has been known in eastern cultures for over 2000 years. However, in spite of institutional support from several kings and emperors of the Delhi sultanate (up to the Mughal empire), it could not be institutionalized into a sustainable community kitchen, but continued as volunteer-run free food opportunities. 

Within the Jammu hills, a significant component of the Sufi missionaries&#x27; social outreach was to organize community kitchens, known locally as langar. In addition to providing meals to the needy, they were also intended to promote inclusion within their society and discourage segregation and untouchability, both of which were widely practised throughout the Indian subcontinent. This practice, largely facilitated through donations, allowed participants to discard their social identity and was considered a sacred duty. The tradition was inaugurated in the 12-13th century by Shaikh Farid. 

The community kitchen started by the Sikh Gurus, was universal and accepting of people from all faiths and backgrounds, a tradition which has continued to this day. The type of food served and the method of cooking employed, further helped make Sikh langar universally accepted by all faiths and castes.

Several writers such as Gurinder Singh Mann and Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair have alluded to this fact of cooked food (or raw material) being provided to travelers, ascetics and wandering yogis, free food distribution practices being in vogue in fifteenth century among various religious groups like Hindu Nath Yogis and Muslim Sufi saints. However, no evidence exists of formal institutionalized community kitchens, providing cooked free meals, continuously, over a period of time by any particular community.

The roots of such volunteer-run charitable feeding is very old in Indian tradition; for example: Hindu temples of the Gupta Empire era had attached kitchen and almshouse called &quot;dharma-shala&quot; or &quot;dharma-sattra&quot; to feed the travelers and poor, or whatever donation they may leave. These community kitchens and rest houses are evidenced in epigraphical evidence, and in some cases referred to as &quot;satram&quot; (for example, &quot;Annasya Satram&quot;), &quot;choultry&quot;, or &quot;chathram&quot; in parts of India. In fact, Sikh historian Kapur Singh refers to Langar as an Aryan institution. 

The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim I Ching (7th century CE) wrote about monasteries with such volunteer-run kitchens. The institution of the Langar emerged from Fariduddin Ganjshakar, a Sufi Muslim saint living in the Punjab region during the 13th century. This concept further spread and is documented in &quot;Jawahir al-Faridi&quot; compiled in 1623 CE.

The concept of langar—which was designed to be upheld among all people, regardless of religion, caste, colour, creed, age, gender, or social status—was an innovative charity and symbol of equality introduced into Sikhism by its founder, Guru Nanak around 1500 CE in North Indian state of Punjab.

The second Guru of Sikhism, Guru Angad, is remembered in Sikh tradition for systematizing the institution of langar in all Sikh Gurdwara premises, where visitors from near and far could get a free simple meal in a simple and equal seating. He also set rules and training method for volunteers (&quot;sevadars&quot;) who operated the kitchen, placing emphasis on treating it as a place of rest and refuge, and being always polite and hospitable to all visitors.

It was the third Guru, Guru Amar Das, who established langar as a prominent institution, and required people to dine together irrespective of their caste and class. He encouraged the practice of langar, and made all those who visited him attend langar before they could speak to him.

==Contemporary practice==

Langars are held in gurdwaras all over the world, most of which attract members of the homeless population. The volunteers feed people without any discrimination, alongside the Sikh devotees who gather. Almost all gurdwaras operate langars where local communities, sometimes consisting of hundreds or thousands of visitors, join for a simple lacto-vegetarian meal.

<doc id="522852" wikidata="Q12060225" url="?curid=522852" title="History of Isan">
<text>The history of Isan (, ) has been determined by its geography, situated as it is on the Korat Plateau between Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand.

The national government claimed that the name &quot;Isan&quot; was derived from Sanskrit &quot;Īśāna&quot;, a name of Shiva they claimed referred to his rule of the northeast (Sanskrit &quot;īśānya&quot;). This interpretation was intended to reinforce Isan&#x27;s identity as the northeast of Thailand, rather than as part of the Lao kingdom because of the fear of the Lao people seceding.

The Thai king Vajiravudh reinvoked the ancient name, designating the northeast sector of the Rattanakosin Kingdom &quot;Isan&quot;. Previously, in the reign of Chulalongkorn in early 20th century, the sector was generally called &quot;Hua Mueang Lao&quot; (&quot;Lao Townships&quot; ) for the area north of Nakhon Ratchasima (Korat) and &quot;Khamen Pa Dong&quot; (&quot;Wilderness Khmer&quot;, ) for the townships to the east. Later, the term &quot;Isan&quot; came into wide, if unofficial, use as a term for the northeastern region, and &quot;khon Isan&quot; (&quot;Isan people&quot;, ) as a general term for the peoples of Isan.

Isan has been dominated by each of its neighbors in turn, although its relative infertility meant it was more often a battleground than a prize. Rather than being incorporated into the respective empires of each power, the area was divided into &quot;mueang&quot; (&quot;city-states&quot;, ), each paying tribute to one or more powers under the mandala system.

Throughout the 20th century, the Thai government took steps to cement Isan&#x27;s status as a part of Thailand and to de-emphasize the Lao, Khmer and Kuy origins of its population, a process known as Thaification.

The majority of people in present-day Isan speak the Lao language known as Isan. Many Khmer speakers live in the southern half and substantial minorities of Katuic speakers (i.e., Kuy, Bru, and So) also exist. Most Isan people are both conversant and to some degree literate in Central Thai. Before the central government introduced the Thai alphabet and language in regional schools, the people of Isan wrote in the Lao alphabet, a very similar script that Thai adopted. Most people still speak the Isan language, a dialect of the Lao language, as their first language. A significant minority in the south also speak Northern Khmer.

The Kuy people, an Austroasiatic people concentrated around the core of what was once the Chenla Kingdom and known as the &quot;Khmer Boran&quot; &quot;ancient Khmer&quot;, are a link to the region&#x27;s pre-Tai history.

==Prehistory==
Four &quot;Homo erectus&quot; fossil skull fragments found in northern Thailand&#x27;s Hat Pudui cave (Ko Kha District, Lampang Province) by Thai paleontologists Somsak Pramankij and Vadhana Subhavanin, were in deposits dating from the mid-Pleistocene era, which was before the Khorat Plateau had uplifted from an extensive plain. Professor Phillip V. Tobias of Johannesburg&#x27;s University of the Witwatersrand examined the fragments and said: &quot;It seems unavoidable but to conclude that Thailand must have been a highway or crossroads in the movement of hominids — members of the family of man.&quot;

Pha Taem cliff paintings alongside the Mekong in Udon Thani Province date to around 1500 BC. They are younger than but similar in composition to the Rock Paintings of Hua Mountain in southern China, which are attributed to the Luoyue people of what is today the lowland plains of northern Vietnam, particularly the marshy, agriculturally rich area of the Red River Delta, and particularly associated with the Bronze Age Đông Sơn culture of mainland Southeast Asia.

The Ban Chiang archaeological site, dating from around 3000 BC to 300 AD, attracted attention in 1966 as seemingly the world&#x27;s oldest site showing traces of a Bronze Age culture, due to errors in dating. In Fine Arts, the site is remarkable for its pottery; further investigation into ancient skeletal remains raised serious questions about transitions to sedentism and intensified agriculture. The question as to why the site was abandoned until resettled by 19th–century Lao émigrés remains to be settled. The Bronze Age site of Ban Non Wat in the southeast of the plateau is also under investigation (2002–present.)

==Early history==

The first major civilisation to occupy Isan was considered, by the study of artifacts, to be Dvaravati. The remains of walled and moated towns scattered the region, in the valleys of Chi and Mun Rivers. The remains often show the Buddhist and Hinduist influence, perhaps expanding from the western part or the coastal and the Chao Phraya River basin.
==Khmer Domination==

From the 11th century, the Dvaravati or Mon culture from the Chao Phraya River basin was gradually displaced by the Khmer Empire of Angkor. Many principal centers became Angkor&#x27;s tributary states. Consequently, a number of temples influenced by ancient Khmer art were found in Isan, most notably in southern part, at Phanom Rung and Phimai, which lie on the so-called Ancient Khmer Highway, the direct link to Angkor. Inscriptions found also told the connections between vassal towns and the court of Angkor.

==Sukhothai==
The Sukhothai Kingdom broke free from the Angkor Empire around the 13th century. Although Isan is not thought to have been a part of the Sukhothai kingdom due to the lack of clear evidence, the Khmer empire became weaker and retreated to its Cambodian heartlands, leaving Isan in the hands of fragmented &quot;muang&quot; () &quot;city-states&quot; or statelets. However, many Khmer-speaking people remained and are still a prominent fixture in the southern area, constituting the majority in present-day southern part of the region such as in present-day Surin Province, Buriram Province and are also numerous in part of Sisaket Province.

==Lan Xang==
The Lao kingdom of Lan Xang was established in Luang Prabang in the 14th century by Fa Ngum. The kingdom&#x27;s name means &quot;Million Elephants&quot;, echoing the name of the neighboring northern kingdom of Lan Na &quot;Million Rice Paddies&quot;. As the Khmer Empire continued to retreat under pressure from the neighboring Tai kingdoms of the Ayutthaya Kingdom and Lan Xang. Ayutthaya established a presence at Nakhon Ratchasima and Phimai. However, the bulk of the Khorat Plateau fell into the mandala of Lan Xang.

Lao settlers began gradually moving across the Mekong into Isan between the 14th and 16th centuries. Major cities were established at Loei, Viang Khuk, Nong Khai, Nong Bua Lamphu (traditionally held by the crown prince), Sakon Nakhon, Nakhon Phanom, Roi Et, Suwannaphume, and Champasak. Additional settlements were located Nong Han Noi, Mahukhanakhon, and a number of settlements across the Mekong from Vientiane including Sri Xiang Mai, Phon Phao, Tha Bo, Say Fong, and Phon Phisai. Many of these early settlements were destroyed or abandoned in the aftermath of the Lao rebellion (1826-1828). Lan Xang was divided by a succession dispute after the death of King Sourigna Vongsa in 1700, into the competing Kingdom of Vientiane, Kingdom of Luang Phrabang and Kingdom of Champasak. Most of what would become the Isan was split between Vientiane and Champasak.

==Siam==
With the rise of King Taksin, his Thonburi Kingdom began expanding direct control over the region. Thonburi forces invaded and took control of the Kingdom of Luang Phrabang and the Kingdom of Vientiane and Isan entered its direct orbit.

In 1718, Lao settlers in the company of an official in the service of King Nokasad of the Kingdom of Champasak founded &quot;mueang&quot; Suwannaphum.

During late 18th century, the Lao kingdoms of Luang Phrabang and Champasak were increasingly at odds with Vientiane. As Vientiane struggled to maintain control of Isan, a number of dissidents began migrating from Vientiane and taking refuge in Isan. Most of them recognized Siam as their suzerain according to the mandala system. Under this system, mueang leaders were granted something equivalent to a fiefdom and a noble title as governor, having full right of rulership over their towns. Thus they eventually became the subjects of the royal court in Bangkok. New towns were founded such and Chaiyaphum along with many minor towns such as Han Chai Cham Na.
In 1827, King Anouvong of Vientiane rebelled against Siam. After a successful attack on the stronghold of Korat, he was defeated and in Yasothon a memorial to the defeat was raised. The defeat of Anu&#x27;s revolt was followed by forced migrations from defeated Lao kingdoms to Isan, further increasing the dominance of Lao culture in the region but weakening the mueang of the Lao. The governors of these new towns were semi-autonomous. They had right to rule, to tax their own subject, part of which might be transferred to Bangkok periodically. If time of war, these local rulers had a duty to send troops to defend Siam.

Following defeat in the Franco-Siamese conflict, Siam ceded Luang Phrabang and Champasak to France in 1893 and 1904. Isan became the kingdom&#x27;s northeast frontier as the buffer zone between French Indochina and Siam, with Siam becoming a &#x27;buffer zone&#x27; between the United Kingdom and France with the &quot;Entente Cordiale&quot;. Thus began the process of annexation of Isan area into the modern Siamese nation.

Prince Damrong Rajanubhab as the new Minister of Interior (1892) introduced the monthon administration system known as &quot;Thesaphiban&quot; ( - literally, control over territory) - officially adopted by the 1897 Local Administration Act, which transferred much power from the traditional provincial governors drawn from the local nobility to the newly established &quot;monthon&quot; commissioners and civil servants (รองอำมาตย์ - court support) appointed by Bangkok. In 1902, local revolts broke out in Isan, often led by charismatic religious leaders called () or (&quot;Holy man&quot;). One of the most serious of these rebellions ( ) recalled the resistance to Thonburi authority by the monk Chao Phra Faang, 1768–70. A former monk and &quot;Phu Mi Bun&quot; in the Ubon Ratchathani area headed a millenarian sect inspired by his predictions of &#x27;apocalyptic&#x27; vision. His apocalyptic prophecy created panic among almost all of the Isan people until the Bangkok government eventually crushed it.

From the 20th century onwards, Siam gradually consolidated its control over Isan through a programme of Thaification. The introduction of a national school system in the 1920s replaced instruction by monks in the Isan Lao language with teaching in the Thai language only. Radio and television, when they began, also broadcast in Thai. They included (and still do) twice daily broadcasts of the Thai National Anthem.

Even after the Revolution in 1932, when democratic rule began, Isan was ignored by the new Thai government. Most of the region was underdeveloped. Apparently new or necessary infrastructure were hardly built. Albeit the biggest part of Thailand, until now, there are still only two railways in the region and most of modern paved roads were built in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Communism==

In the latter half of the 20th century, Isan was perceived by the Thai government as a potential breeding ground for Communism. The region&#x27;s poverty, special history, remoteness and inaccessible terrain all contributed to this fear.

Inevitably, the extent to which Communist insurgents were a real threat in Isan is hard to determine. It is known that there were a number of political attacks from the 1960s onwards, and that Communist activists and equipment entered the region from Laos. On the other hand, the number of guerrillas probably never exceeded a few thousand, and the combination of action by the security forces and the offers of amnesties had largely ended the threat by the early 1980s.

==US bases==

The fight against Communism persuaded the government to allow the establishment of a number of US bases in Isan, notably in the provinces of Nakhon Ratchasima, Nakhon Phanom, Udon Thani, Nakhon Sawan and Ubon Ratchathani. Although the bases were directed at Communists in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, they had an indirect effect in promoting development and opposing Communism in Isan. The bases required the creation of improved transport links, facilitating the integration of Isan with the rest of Thailand. The most important of these was Highway 2 named the Mittraphap Road (&quot;Friendship Highway&quot;,) which links with Bangkok and Isan. and other northeast highways that being with the numeral 2, which link the region&#x27;s major cities with each other. These remain Isan&#x27;s primary road links, with many later to be incorporated into the 21st-century Asian Highway Network. Complemented by Thai government programs to build minor roads, these projects did much to bind rural Isan more closely to the cities and to Bangkok.

The number of US servicemen reached its peak in 1969 at 50,000. This influx of US personnel also had a direct effect in exposing the region to western culture. This helped to promote the development of the region, but it also created a sizable sex industry in the vicinity of the bases. Finally, the US military presence contributed substantial sums of money to the area&#x27;s economy, with emigrant-spouses who accompanied American servicemen continuing to send substantial sums home. The bases were closed at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.

==Development==
The Thai government promoted development in Isan as one weapon in the fight against Communism. In particular, Field Marshal Sarit Dhanarajata, who took control of the country in 1958, was a native of Isan and promoted a number of development projects there.

From the 1960s onwards, the government launched a string of development programmes aimed wholly or in part at Isan. These began with a five-year development plan announced in 1961 and backed by US aid. The program&#x27;s &quot;top down&quot; approach was satirized in a country song still being sung decades later. An Accelerated Rural Development Programme followed in 1964, again with US support. This was administered by provincial governors in the hope of circumventing the inefficiencies of central government, but it could not evade the problems of bureaucracy, corruption and a conservative mindset which hampered all development efforts.

1960s projects to introduce improved crop strains have been criticised for forcing farmers to take out loans to pay for the seed, fertiliser and equipment required, while reducing genetic diversity. Even in the 1970s, government per capita spending on rural assistance programmes was lower in Isan than anywhere else in Thailand.

Nevertheless, much was achieved: Mobile Rural Development Units focusing on health education trained about 1000 field workers per year in the late 1960s; hydroelectric schemes such as Nam Pong/Ubon Ratana power station in Khon Kaen and Lam Pao in Kalasin provided electricity; modern toilets were distributed; government rice purchase programmes maintained prices.

Education efforts increased the proportion of children attending high school from 4.4% in 1970 to 80% by 2000. Universities were established beginning with Khon Kaen University in 1964, soon followed by Mahasarakham University and Suranaree University of Technology.

==Recent history==
An important political issue at the end of the 20th century was the construction of the Pak Mun dam in the district of Khong Chiam, in Ubon Ratchathani Province. The project was completed in 1994, flooding 117 square kilometres of land and displacing around 3000 families. The project has been criticised for insufficient compensation payments, adverse effects on the fisheries of the Mun River, and failure to produce the projected power output.

Protesters against the Pak Mun dam joined with other grassroots activists in 1995 to form the Assembly of the Poor, a group seeking to promote the involvement of the poor in decision-making processes, and to have their interests taken into account. The group has organised a number of protests against the project in Bangkok. The now deposed prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, responded by claiming that activists NGO Living River Siam are trouble-makers who do not reflect the opinions of ordinary people. The same issue arose with the Rasi Salai Dam in Sisaket Province, which was also completed in 1994 for the generation of electricity; it was abandoned for that purpose in 2000 and converted into a recreation area.

<text>NCAA Division III independent schools are four-year institutions that compete in college athletics at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III level, but do not belong to an established intercollegiate athletic conference for a particular sport. These schools may however still compete as members of an athletic conference in other sports. A school may also be fully independent, and not belong to any athletic conference for any sport at all. The reason for independent status varies among institutions, but it is frequently because the school&#x27;s primary athletic conference does not sponsor a particular sport.

<text>Centaurus A (also known as NGC 5128 or Caldwell 77) is a galaxy in the constellation of Centaurus. It was discovered in 1826 by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop from his home in Parramatta, in New South Wales, Australia. There is considerable debate in the literature regarding the galaxy&#x27;s fundamental properties such as its Hubble type (lenticular galaxy or a giant elliptical galaxy) and distance (11–13 million light-years). It is the closest radio galaxy to Earth, as well as the closest BL Lac object, so its active galactic nucleus has been extensively studied by professional astronomers. The galaxy is also the fifth-brightest in the sky, making it an ideal amateur astronomy target. It is only visible from the southern hemisphere and low northern latitudes.

The center of the galaxy contains a supermassive black hole with a mass of 55 million solar masses, which ejects a relativistic jet that is responsible for emissions in the X-ray and radio wavelengths. By taking radio observations of the jet separated by a decade, astronomers have determined that the inner parts of the jet are moving at about half of the speed of light. X-rays are produced farther out as the jet collides with surrounding gases, resulting in the creation of highly energetic particles. The X-ray jets of Centaurus A are thousands of light-years long, while the radio jets are over a million light-years long.

It is also one of the nearest large starburst galaxies, of which a galactic collision is suspected to be responsible for an intense burst of star formation. Models have suggested that Centaurus A was a large elliptical galaxy that collided with a smaller spiral galaxy, with which it will eventually merge. For that reason, the galaxy has been of particular interest to astronomers for years. While collisions of spiral galaxies are relatively common, the effects of a collision between an elliptical and a spiral galaxy are not fully understood.

== Observational history ==
NGC 5128 was discovered on 29 April 1826 by James Dunlop during a survey at the Parramatta Observatory.

In 1847 John Herschel described the galaxy as &quot;two semi-ovals of elliptically formed nebula appearing to be cut asunder and separated by a broad obscure band parallel to the larger axis of the nebula, in the midst of which a faint streak of light parallel to the sides of the cut appears.&quot;

In 1949 John Gatenby Bolton, Bruce Slee and Gordon Stanley localized NGC 5128 as one of the first extragalactic radio sources. Five years later, Walter Baade and Rudolph Minkowski suggested that the peculiar structure is the result of a merge event of a giant elliptical galaxy and a small spiral galaxy. The first detection of X-ray emissions, using a sounding rocket, was performed in 1970. In 1975–76 gamma-ray emissions from Centaurus A were observed through the atmospheric Cherenkov technique.

The Einstein Observatory detected an X-ray jet emanating from the nucleus in 1979. Ten years later, young blue stars were found along the central dust band with the Hubble Space Telescope.

The Chandra X-ray Observatory identified in 1999 more than 200 new point sources. Another space telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, found a parallelogram-shaped structure of dust in near infrared images of Centaurus A in 2006.

Evidence of gamma emissions with very high energy (more than 100 GeV) was detected by the H.E.S.S-Observatorium in Namibia in 2009.

The following year, Centaurus A was identified as a source of cosmic rays of highest energies, after years of observations by Pierre Auger Observatory. In 2016 a review of data from Chandra and XMM-Newton, unusual high flares of energy were found in NGC 5128 and the galaxy NGC 4636. Jimmy Irwin of University of Alabama hypothesized the discovery as potentially a black hole in a yet unknown process or an intermediate-mass black hole.

==Morphology==
Centaurus A may be described as having a peculiar morphology. As seen from Earth, the galaxy looks like a lenticular or elliptical galaxy with a superimposed dust lane. The peculiarity of this galaxy was first identified in 1847 by John Herschel, and the galaxy was included in Halton Arp&#x27;s &quot;Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies&quot; (published in 1966) as one of the best examples of a &quot;disturbed&quot; galaxy with dust absorption. The galaxy&#x27;s strange morphology is generally recognized as the result of a merger between two smaller galaxies.

The bulge of this galaxy is composed mainly of evolved red stars. The dusty disk, however, has been the site of more recent star formation; over 100 star formation regions have been identified in the disk.

==Novae and supernovae==
Two supernovae have been detected in Centaurus A.
The first supernova, named SN 1986G, was discovered within the dark dust lane of the galaxy by Robert Evans on 3 May 1986.
It was later identified as a Type Ia supernova,
which forms when a white dwarf&#x27;s mass grows large enough to ignite carbon fusion in its center, touching off a runaway thermonuclear reaction, as may happen when a white dwarf in a binary star system strips gas away from the other star. SN 1986G was used to demonstrate that the spectra of type Ia supernovae are not all identical, and that type Ia supernovae may differ in the way that they change in brightness over time.

The second supernova, designated SN 2016adj, was discovered by Backyard Observatory Supernova Search in February 2016 and was initially classified as a Type II supernova based on its H-alpha emission line.
A subsequent classification found the spectrum best resembled the Type Ib core-collapse supernova 1999dn. (See Type Ib and Ic supernovae).

In addition to these supernovae, a luminous red nova, designated AT2020nqq (type ILRT, mag. 17.8), was discovered on 27 June 2020.

Centaurus A is close enough that classical novae can also be detected. The first confirmed nova in this galaxy was discovered by BlackGEM at magnitude 18.47 on 23 December 2024, and designated AT 2024aeql.

==Distance==
Distance estimates to Centaurus A established since the 1980s typically range between 3–5 Mpc. Classical Cepheids discovered in the heavily obscured dust lane of Centaurus A yield a distance between ~3–3.5 Mpc, depending on the nature of the extinction law adopted and other considerations. Mira variables and Type II Cepheids were also discovered in Centaurus A, the latter being rarely detected beyond the Local Group. The distance to Centaurus A established from several indicators such as Mira variables and planetary nebulae favour a more distant value of ~3.8 Mpc.

==Nearby galaxies and galaxy group information==
Centaurus A is at the center of one of two subgroups within the Centaurus A/M83 Group, a nearby group of galaxies. Messier 83 (the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy) is at the center of the other subgroup. These two groups are sometimes identified as one group and sometimes identified as two groups. However, the galaxies around Centaurus A and the galaxies around M83 are physically close to each other, and both subgroups appear not to be moving relative to each other. The Centaurus A/M83 Group is located in the Virgo Supercluster.

In addition to dwarf galaxies, Centaurus A, like most galaxies, has a population of globular clusters. Some objects that appear to be globular clusters are hypothesized to be the tidally stripped cores of former galaxies. The most extreme example is the object VHH81-01, whose central black hole is estimated to be around .

== Observations ==
=== Radio waves ===


In July 2021 the Event Horizon Telescope released a resolved image of Centaurus A showing the jet coming from the black hole at its center.

==Visibility==

Centaurus A is located approximately 4° north of Omega Centauri (a globular cluster visible with the naked eye). Because the galaxy has a high surface brightness and relatively large angular size, it is an ideal target for amateur astronomy observations. The bright central bulge and dark dust lane are visible even in finderscopes and large binoculars, and additional structure may be seen in larger telescopes. Claims have been made that Centaurus A is visible to the naked eye under exceptionally good conditions.

<text>The Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot is a 1995 comic book written by Frank Miller, drawn by Geof Darrow and published by Dark Horse Comics. The comic book was adapted into an animated TV series of the same name.

==Overview==
After appearing in various comic book pin-up and poster pages, the Big Guy first appeared without Rusty in issues #6 and 7 of Mike Allred&#x27;s &quot;Madman Comics&quot;, which was part of Dark Horse Comics&#x27; now defunct Legend imprint.

The property graduated to its own series, a large format two-issue mini-series in 1995, written by Frank Miller and illustrated by Geof Darrow. The story revolves around an attack on Tokyo by a giant reptilian creature that is originated in an experiment gone wrong, and the failure of the newly commissioned Rusty the Boy Robot to stop the threat. Subsequently, Japan requested help from the U.S. Armed Forces, whose ultimate defense, the robot Big Guy, launches from his air carrier base and uses his awesome arsenal and good old-fashioned American know-how to save the day.
Big Guy also makes an appearance in Frank Miller and Dave Gibbons&#x27; &quot;Martha Washington Stranded in Space&quot; and cameo appearances in the last Sin City book, &quot;Sin City: Hell and Back&quot;.

==Adaptation==

A two-season television adaptation, featuring the voices of Pamela Segall, Jonathan David Cook, Gabrielle Carteris, Stephen Root, Kathy Kinney, Kevin Michael Richardson, M. Emmet Walsh, and R. Lee Ermey, aired on the Fox Kids Network for 26 episodes from September 18, 1999 to March 5, 2001.

<text>A Rigid-framed power kite is one of the power kites which consists of a single skin and a rigid frame. They are often used in the popular sport of kite surfing. Typically it has four lines and a pair of handles; or a particular style of bar, again with 4 lines. (See also kite control systems) The best known commercial kite of this type is the Peter Lynn C-Quad.

This type of foil kite is related to the leading edge inflatable kite and the bow kite, which have a similar shape but typically do not include a rigid frame.

<text> is a free software indexing and searching system created in 1995 by Andrew Scherpbier while he was employed at San Diego State University. It can provide a search engine for a single website.

It includes three groups of files: a set of tools for indexing, a set of tools for searching, and a set of HTML files for building the user interface to access the search engine. works differently from most search engines as most engines use a two-step process, building an index and searching it. indexes pages in full, then processes the pages into a searchable form later using soundex and metaphone. also stores fuzzy match information instead of using a dynamic algorithm. At one time, over 500 organizations used to index sites they owned. Notable sites included Blizzard Entertainment, Greenpeace, and The Mozilla Foundation.

The last official release is Dig 3.2.0b6 announced on 16 June 2004. Only sporadic maintenance is in evidence since that date at the project&#x27;s bug reporting page. It was used by the GNU project&#x27;s website for a long time but was replaced in 2008 with Hyper Estraier.

<doc id="522894" wikidata="Q3175821" url="?curid=522894" title="Great Satan">
<text>The &quot;Great Satan&quot; () is a derogatory epithet used in some Muslim-majority countries to refer to the United States. Alongside the &quot;Death to America&quot; slogan, it originated in Iran during the Islamic Revolution. While it is primarily an expression of anti-American sentiment, it has occasionally been used to refer to the United Kingdom, although the term &quot;old fox&quot; is more popular as a dedicated expression of anti-British sentiment.

The epithet was coined by Iranian religious leader Ruhollah Khomeini, who used it in a speech on 5 November 1979, one day after the onset of the Iran hostage crisis. In the speech, he condemned the United States as an imperialist power that sponsored corruption throughout the world. Khomeini introduced the epithet as the larger of a pair, using the term &quot;Little Satan&quot; to refer to Israel, particularly in the context of Israel–United States relations. In the context of the Cold War, Khomeini used the related term &quot;Lesser Satan&quot; to refer to the Soviet Union, and asserted that revolutionary Iran should oppose the Americans and the Soviets alike.

== Background ==
The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of espousing anti-Western sentiment as a result of interference in Iranian affairs by the British and U.S. governments. In 1907, an agreement signed between the British and Russian empires divided Iran into spheres of influence, infuriating Iranian public opinion. 46 years later in 1953, in response to the decision by Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq to nationalize the petroleum industry in Iran, the CIA and MI6 organized a coup d&#x27;état to overthrow his administration in favor of a pro-Western leader, Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. The Eisenhower administration was concerned that Mossadeq&#x27;s nationalist aspirations could lead to an eventual communist takeover of Iran. After widespread rioting and with help from the CIA and MI6, Mossadeq was defeated and the Shah returned to power, ensuring support for Western oil interests in Iran and ending the perceived threat of communist expansion. General Fazlollah Zahedi, who led the military coup, became prime minister. The operation was code-named Operation Ajax. At first, the military coup seemed to fail, and Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi fled the country.

In 1965, Ayatollah Khomeini was exiled for criticizing the White Revolution&#x27;s decision to extend the franchise to women, initiate land reforms and the Shah&#x27;s unpopular Status of Forces Bill, which gave U.S. military personnel diplomatic immunity for crimes committed in Iran. By the early 1970s, many Iranians opposed the Shah&#x27;s government. Khomeini eventually returned to Iran and led the 1979 Iranian revolution. During the Iranian Revolution, demonstrators commonly chanted slogans such as &quot;Death to Shah,&quot; &quot;Independence, Freedom, Islamic Republic,&quot; and &quot;Death to America&quot;.

== Definition ==
=== Great Satan (United States) ===
Khomeini is quoted as saying on November 5, 1979, &quot;[America is] the great Satan, the wounded snake.&quot; The term was used extensively during and after the Islamic Revolution, and it continues to be used in some Iranian political circles. Use of the term at rallies is often accompanied by shouts of &quot;Marg bar Amrika!&quot; (&quot;Death to America&quot;). It is used in academic journals.

=== Lesser Satan (Soviet Union) ===
Khomeini called the Soviet Union, the principal antagonist of the US during the Cold War, the &quot;Lesser Satan&quot; because of its atheistic communist ideology, and he said that Iran should support neither side of the Cold War.

=== Little Satan (Israel) ===
The State of Israel was condemned as the &quot;Little Satan&quot; in 1979 by Khomeini when he was addressing Israel&#x27;s backing of the Shah, its close ties to the US, and the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi also stated that &quot;Israel is the little Satan&quot; in a July 1980 interview.

<text>USS &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; (CVE-73) was a of the United States Navy. During the Battle off Samar, part of the overall Battle of Leyte Gulf, during a successful effort to turn back a much larger attacking Japanese surface force, &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; was sunk by naval gunfire, primarily from the battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;, taking at least 15 hits between 8:10 and 8:50. She was the only American aircraft carrier sunk by enemy surface gunfire during World War II.

Named for Gambier Bay on Admiralty Island in the Alaska Panhandle, she was originally classified AVG-73, was reclassified ACV-73 on 20 August 1942 and again reclassified CVE-73 on 15 July 1943; launched under a Maritime Commission contract by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington on 22 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. H. C. Zitzewitz, wife of Lieutenant Commander Herbert C. Zitzewitz, the Senior Naval Liaison Officer (SNLO) assigned to Kaiser&#x27;s Vancouver Yard from the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ships; and commissioned at Astoria, Oregon on 28 December 1943, Captain Hugh H. Goodwin in command.

The ship was referred to as the &quot;Bonus Ship&quot; by yard personnel because she was the 19th carrier delivered in 1943. The yard had originally projected 16 carriers would be delivered before the end of 1943. However, in September the Navy asked the yard to increase that number by at least two more. To rally the workers, Kaiser initiated a campaign called &quot;18 or More by &#x27;44&quot; to meet the new challenge; being the 19th and last Kaiser-built carrier commissioned in 1943, &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; was dubbed the &quot;Bonus Ship&quot;. No ships of her class survive today.

==Service history==

===World War II===
After shakedown out of San Diego, the escort carrier sailed on 7 February 1944 with 400 troops embarked for Pearl Harbor, thence to rendezvous off the Marshalls, guarded by the destroyer , where she flew 84 replacement planes to the fleet carrier . She returned to San Diego via Pearl Harbor, ferrying aircraft for repairs and qualified carrier pilots off the coast of Southern California. She departed on 1 May 1944 to join Rear Admiral Harold B. Sallada&#x27;s Carrier Support Group 2 (TG 52.11), staging in the Marshalls for the invasion of the Marianas.

&quot;Gambier Bay&quot; gave close air support to the initial landings of Marines on Saipan 15 June 1944, destroying enemy gun emplacements, troops, tanks, and trucks. On the 17th, her combat air patrol (CAP) shot down or turned back all but a handful of 47 enemy planes headed for her task group and her gunners shot down two of the three planes that did break through to attack her.

The following day, warning of another air attack sounded. As her fighters prepared to take off, they found intense antiaircraft fire of the entire task group covering their flight path. Captain Goodwin called the event &quot;another shining example of the adaptability and courage of the young men of our country&quot;. Eight pilots of Composite Squadron 10 (VC-10) did take off to help repulse the aerial attack.

&quot;Gambier Bay&quot; remained off Saipan, repulsing aerial raids and launching planes which strafed enemy troop concentrations, bombed gun emplacements, and supported Marines and soldiers fighting ashore. Meanwhile, American carriers slashed the carrier air strength of the combined Japanese Mobile Fleet and turned it back in defeat in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; continued close ground support operations at Tinian (19–31 July), then turned her attention to Guam, where she gave identical aid to invading troops until 11 August.
After a respite for logistics in the Marshalls, &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; spent 15–28 September supporting the amphibious attack which drove ashore and captured Peleliu and Angaur, Southern Palaus. She then steamed by way of Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura), New Guinea, to Manus Island, Admiralties, where the invasion of the Philippines was staged. Screened by four destroyer escorts, &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; and her sister ship escorted transports and amphibious landing ships safely to Leyte Gulf before joining Rear Admiral Clifton A. F. Sprague&#x27;s escort carrier task unit on 19 September off Leyte.

The task unit comprised six escort carriers, screened by three destroyers and four destroyer escorts, and was known by its radio call sign: &quot;Taffy 3&quot;. Under the command of Rear Admiral Thomas L. Sprague, three groups of six-carrier task units, known as &quot;Taffy&quot;s, maintained air supremacy over Leyte Gulf and eastern Leyte. During the invasion their planes destroyed enemy airfields, supply convoys, and troop concentrations; gave troops driving inland vital close air support; and maintained combat air patrol over ships in Leyte Gulf. While &quot;Taffy 1&quot; and &quot;Taffy 2&quot; were respectively stationed off northern Mindanao and off the entrance to Leyte Gulf, &quot;Taffy 3&quot; steamed off Samar.

Meanwhile, the Japanese threw their entire fleet against American naval power in a desperate gamble to destroy the large concentration of American shipping in Leyte Gulf. Powerful Japanese forces—composed of carriers, battleships, cruisers, and destroyers—attempted to converge on the Philippines in a three-pronged attack to the south, center, and north. The Japanese Southern Force met disaster before dawn on 25 October as it tried to drive through Surigao Strait to join the Center Force off Leyte Gulf. While steaming through the Sibuyan Sea en route to the San Bernardino Strait on 24 October, the Center Force was hit hard by hundreds of planes from the carriers of Admiral William &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey&#x27;s Third Fleet. After the Battle of Sibuyan Sea, Admiral Halsey no longer considered the Center Force a serious threat, and he sent the carriers north to intercept decoy carriers of the Japanese Northern Force off Cape Engaño.

=== Battle off Samar ===

The departure of Halsey&#x27;s carriers left the escort carriers of &quot;Taffy 3&quot; as the only ships guarding the area around Samar. American commanders were unaware of night-time movement of the Japanese Center Force toward Samar. However, shortly after sunrise on 25 October, a gap in the morning mist disclosed the pagoda-like masts of enemy battleships and cruisers on the northern horizon. Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s still dangerous Center Force—consisting of four battleships, six heavy cruisers, two light cruisers and 11 destroyers—had slipped undetected through San Bernardino Strait and down the fog-shrouded coast of Samar, bound for Leyte Gulf. Visibility was approximately with a low overcast and occasional rain squalls which the American ships would use to their advantage in the coming battle.

&quot;Taffy 3&quot; was overwhelmingly outgunned by the Center Force. Immediately, an urgent call for help went out from &quot;Taffy 3&quot; as the escort carriers steamed eastward to launch planes before gradually turning south to seek concealment in a heavy squall. American pilots attacked the Japanese formation with torpedoes, bombs, and strafing runs until their ammunition ran out, after which they made &quot;dry runs&quot;—dummy attacks with no ordnance or ammunition—to break up the enemy formation and delay its advance. Smoke was laid down to cover the escort carriers&#x27; escape as the destroyers ducked in and out of the smoke and rain to engage the Japanese warships at point-blank range until ordered back to cover the escort carriers with more smoke.

====Coming under heavy fire====

In spite of these efforts, &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; would come under fire from multiple ships at around 8:10. The heavy cruiser &quot;Chikuma&quot; closed to 10,200 yards and fired off her eight 8-inch (203 mm) guns, but a few minutes later switched fire to the destroyer escort USS &quot;Samuel B Roberts&quot;. Meanwhile at 22,000 yards, the Japanese flagship, the battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;, landed a hit on her first salvo as an 18.1-inch (46 cm) shell smashed through &quot;Gambier Bay&#x27;s&quot; flight deck near her stern, starting a fire on the flight deck which was put out in three minutes. At 8:16, another shell from &quot;Yamato&quot; cut through her hanger bay. &quot;Haruna&quot; also fired a single salvo at &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; before switching fire to escorting destroyers.

====The fatal hit====
Around 08:20, &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; was crippled by a shell hit which flooded her forward engine room, immediately cutting her speed to 10 knots as she gradually slowed until dead in the water 15 minutes later. The damage was initially recorded as a high explosive 8-inch (203 mm) cruiser shell&quot;.&quot; However, Japanese records disprove this and insist the hit was scored by an 18.1-inch (46 cm) shell from &quot;Yamato&quot; from around 20,000 yards. On paper, the difference between a cruiser round and a battleship round should have been apparent, but &quot;Yamato,&quot; having mistaken &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; for a full-sized fleet carrier, was firing armor-piercing shells that over-penetrated her hull without exploding. Most photographs of &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; under fire show her under attack from six-gun salvos and white splashes, corresponding with &quot;Yamato&#x27;s&quot; gun layout, firing angle, and undyed shells. The Japanese heavy cruisers also never switched to high explosive shells (as evidenced by the damage inflicted to USS &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; and USS &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; by &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Haguro)&quot;, thus any cruiser shells that hit the ship would not have exploded.

====Final moments====

&quot;Kongō&quot; then switched fire from an enemy destroyer to &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; at 26,300 yards. At 8:24, two 18.1-inch (46 cm) shells hit &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;, one hit amidships below the waterline and cut through a fresh water tank, flooding the ship with sea water, while another sliced through her bow. These hits were claimed by both &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Kongō,&quot; but &quot;Yamato&quot; was at a much closer range and had the matching firing angle, awarding her the hits. At 8:28, two more hits from &quot;Yamato&quot; made their mark, the former a 6.1-inch (155 mm) shell which exploded in her hanger bay, and the latter an 18.1-inch (46 cm) shell that tore through her flight deck and started a fire which was never put out by damage control for the rest of the time the ship was afloat. Simultaneously, a collum of Japanese heavy cruisers engaged an enemy aircraft carrier which was close to &quot;Gambier Bay&#x27;s&quot; position, leading several historians to conclude they assisted in battering her, but evidence proves their target was &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot;, the escort carrier right next to &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;. 

At 8:30, a high explosive shell, probably from &quot;Yamato&#x27;s&quot; secondary battery, exploded in &quot;Gambier Bay&#x27;s&quot; officer quarters, causing minor damage, another shell ripped through her bulkhead at 8:32. Simultaneously, an attempt was made by the destroyers &quot;Johnston&quot;, &quot;Hoel,&quot; and &quot;Heermann&quot; to cover &quot;Gambier Bay.&quot; This achieved only partial success: &quot;Kongō&quot; engaged &quot;Heermann&quot;, but Yamato only engaged and helped to sink &quot;Hoel&quot; with her secondary battery and continued to pound &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; with her main battery, scoring another two hits at 8:37 which destroyed &quot;Gambier Bay&#x27;s&quot; steering and fuel supply, followed by another hit at 8:43. By 8:45, &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; had fully stopped, prompting &quot;Yamato&quot; to cease fire and turn north and the light cruiser &quot;Noshiro&quot; to fire on her. At 8:50, the abandon ship order was issued as a result &quot;Yamato&#x27;s&quot; gunfire damage. As &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; was being abandoned by her crew, two 6-inch (152 mm) shells from &quot;Noshiro&quot; exploded in her store keeper&#x27;s office. Fires raged through the riddled escort carrier, and she capsized at 09:07 and sank at 09:11, at approximately . Her sinking was witness by &quot;Yamato&quot;, which was concluded to have sunk one enemy &quot;fleet carrier&quot;. Most of her nearly 800 survivors were rescued two days later by landing and patrol craft dispatched from Leyte Gulf. 147 crewmen were killed. The Americans also lost four other ships in the battle—, &quot;Hoel&quot;, &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;, and &quot;Johnston&quot;. &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; was the only US Navy aircraft carrier sunk exclusively by surface naval gunfire during World War II, and one of only three worldwide (along with in 1940 and IJN &quot;Chiyoda&quot; in 1944).

Aircraft from &quot;Taffy 2&quot; joined in the battle off Samar. The events that followed were described by Admiral Sprague:

&quot;At 09:25 my mind was occupied with dodging torpedoes when near the bridge I heard one of the signalmen yell &#x27;They&#x27;re getting away!&#x27; I could hardly believe my eyes, but it looked as if the whole Japanese fleet was indeed retiring. However, it took a whole series of reports from circling planes to convince me. And still I could not get the fact to soak into my battle-numbed brain. At best, I had expected to be swimming by this time.&quot;
&quot;Gambier Bay&quot;″s VC-10 Squadron and other ships of &quot;Taffy 3&quot;—aided by planes of &quot;Taffy 2&quot;—had stopped the powerful Japanese Center Force and inflicted significant losses. Three enemy cruisers were sunk, and much damage was inflicted on the other ships. Overall, the overwhelmingly powerful Japanese surface fleet had been turned back by the escort carriers and their screen of destroyers and destroyer escorts.

==Awards==
&quot;Gambier Bay&quot; received four battle stars for service in World War II and shared in the award of the Presidential Unit Citation to &quot;Taffy 3&quot; for extraordinary heroism in the Battle off Samar. Commanding officer Captain Walter V. R. Vieweg received the Navy Cross for his &quot;extraordinary heroism&quot;. Executive officer Richard R. Ballinger received the Silver Star &quot;for conscious gallantry and intrepidity&quot;.

<text>The Order of the Smile (Polish: &quot;Order Uśmiechu&quot;) is an international award given by children to adults distinguished in their love, care and aid for children.

==History==

The idea of the Order of the Smile was established in 1968 by the Polish magazine &quot;Kurier Polski&quot;, inspired by Wanda Chotomska. In 1979 (announced by the UNESCO as the International Year of the Child) the Secretary-General of the United Nations Kurt Waldheim officially recognized the Order. From then, the Order of the Smile became an international order.

In 1996, in Rabka, the Order of the Smile Museum was established on the grounds of the family park known as &quot;Rabkoland.&quot; After the region had been given the official status of the &quot;City of Children from around the World,&quot; an initiative was put forward to open a permanent Polish Santa&#x27;s Village, which would accept letters addressed to Santa Claus from children across Poland.

In 2003 an International Chapter of the Order of the Smile session took place outside the Warsaw headquarters in Świdnica, where the Child Friendship Center was being erected. Świdnica had been officially titled the &quot;Capital of Children&#x27;s Dreams,&quot; and September 21, 2003, was declared Order of the Smile Children&#x27;s Day.

==Design==
Chotomska&#x27;s television series &quot;Jacek i Agatka&quot; announced a competition to submit a design for the Order of the Smile. The award&#x27;s logo was created and developed by a nine-year-old girl from Głuchołazy, Ewa Chrobak. Using a plate as a template, she drew a sun, and added uneven rays of light. The design, one of 45,000 that had been submitted, was chosen by Szymon Kobyliński, who elaborated it into its current form.

== Nomination ==
All candidates for the Order of Smile should be nominated by children. Nominations can come from a single child or collectively from many children. Nominations can be submitted from all around the world. The candidates should be people of extraordinary love and work for children. Nominations should be sent to the International Chapter of the Order of Smile (ICOS). Afterwards the candidates are chosen to be Laureates by the Chapter.

The Order is awarded twice a year: in spring and in fall. Laureates of the Order of Smile include now about 1000 people from almost 50 countries (state of April 2016).

==Decorating==
The medal - which is a badge representing a smiling sun - is awarded in Warsaw, Poland by the International Chapter of the Order of the Smile. There is a special procedure of the decoration. In special cases the decoration could be held outside Poland, in the country of the laureate. The right to use the title of the &quot;Knight of the Order of Smile&quot; is guaranteed only to those who were decorated at an official ceremony organized by the Chapter.

Traditionally, upon being awarded with the medal, each recipient must drink a glass or cup of lemon juice while smiling throughout the process.

== International Chapter ==
Although most of the 59 members of the Chapter are of Polish descent, it includes representatives from other countries such as Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Romania, Serbia, Sudan, Tunisia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States.

At the forefront of the International Chapter of the Order of Smile stands the Chancellor, Marek Michalak, who remains in this position since 19 January 2007. Previous Chancellors include: Ewa Szelburg-Zarembina (from 1968 to 1976), Radoslaw Ostrowicz (from 1982 to 1990), and Cezary Leżenski (from 1976 to 1981, and again from 1992 to 2006).

On 16 November 1992, the International Chapter of the Order of Smile was officially registered in Poland as an association.

<text>The Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia, more commonly known as the Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia, is a political party in Nova Scotia, Canada. Like most conservative parties in Atlantic Canada, it has been historically associated with the Red Tory faction of Canadian conservatism. The party is currently led by Pictou East MLA Tim Houston. The party won a majority government in the 2021 provincial election. He called a snap election in 2024, increasing his party&#x27;s majority mandate. The Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia and the Conservative Party of Canada are two separate entities.

==History==
The Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia, registered under the Nova Scotia Elections Act as the Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia, originated from the Confederation Party of Charles Tupper. Tupper united members of the pre-Confederation Conservative Party (who were predominantly United Empire Loyalists and members of the business elite) and supporters of Sir John A. Macdonald&#x27;s national Conservative coalition. The party supported Macdonald&#x27;s protectionist National Policy, nation-building, and the unification of British North America.

Canadian Confederation was initially unpopular in Nova Scotia, and the party was out of government for most of the late 19th century. It formed government for only six years between 1867 and 1956. It bottomed out in 1945, when the party was shut out of the legislature altogether.

The modern party was built by Robert Stanfield after World War II. Stanfield, the scion of a wealthy textile family, had considered himself socialist in university; though he later moderated his views, he always remained a progressive. Under his leadership, what was by then the &quot;Progressive Conservative Party&quot; became a moderate Red Tory organization. He was able to get the party back into the House of Assembly soon after taking the leadership. By 1956, he had built it into an organization that was able to sweep to power, winning re-election four times.

As premier, he led reforms in human rights, education, municipal government and health care and also created Industrial Estates Limited, a crown corporation that successfully attracted investment from world companies such as Michelin Tire. He worked to modernized the road system, brought in the first form of Medicare, established the first economic development agency, invested heavily in education at all levels and established the predecessor to the Nova Scotia Community College.

After Stanfield left provincial politics to become leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party in 1967, G. I. Smith served as premier until 1970. After being elected party leader in 1971, John Buchanan was elected premier in 1978. He was re-elected in 1981, 1984 and 1988. In the 1984 election, voters served his largest majority, capturing 42 of the 52 seats in the legislature. Buchanan&#x27;s government first succeeded in convincing federal government to give Nova Scotia control over offshore resources such as gas and oil, resulting in future revenue for the province through the Crown Share.

Roger Bacon became premier in 1990 after Buchanan was appointed to the Senate of Canada and until the party selected Donald W. Cameron as party leader and premier. During his term, Cameron reformed government finance practices, promoted anti-discrimination measures, introduced new government accountability measures and established the first non-partisan electoral boundaries revision commission in 1992.

==Recent history==
After six years of Liberal governments led by John Savage and later Russel MacLellan, PC leader John Hamm was elected premier in 1999. After taking office, he invested more in education and health care, implemented some tax cuts and sold or closed government-owned industries such as Sydney Steel. His government also passed tough lobbyist registration legislation, introduced smoking cessation initiatives, provided new funding for community college modernization and achieved historically high economic growth and employment numbers. His government was the first to truly balance provincial finances in 25 years in 2002. Hamm retired as Premier of Nova Scotia and leader of the PC party in 2006.Rodney MacDonald was elected to replace Hamm as party leader in 2006 and subsequently became Premier of Nova Scotia. Through strategic investments in rural broadband infrastructure, MacDonald continued to expand high-speed internet access throughout the province. MacDonald&#x27;s government moved to help stabilize energy costs, grow the economy and attract new investment to the province.

The 2006 election resulted in a reduced minority for MacDonald and the Progressive Conservatives were reduced to third-party status in the 2009 election. On June 24, 2009, MacDonald stepped down as leader and Karen Casey was named the interim leader.

Jamie Baillie became leader of the PC Party on October 30, 2010 after running unopposed. He led the party into the 2013 election, and won eleven seats allowing the PC party form the Official Opposition. In the 2017 election, the party retained official opposition status, and increased their seat count to 17.

On November 1, 2017, Baillie announced he was stepping down as leader. Baillie was to remain in the position until a new leader was chosen, however on January 24, 2018, he resigned after the party executive requested his immediate resignation due to &quot;allegations of inappropriate behaviour&quot;. Following his resignation, Pictou West MLA Karla MacFarlane was named interim leader. 

In 2018, Tim Houston was elected the leader of the PC party after getting a large plurality of the points in the first round.

In the 2021 Nova Scotia general election, Tim Houston fought the campaign on a pledge to spend quite a bit to fix healthcare. The Progressive Conservative party won a majority government for the first time since 1999 and formed government for the first time since 2006.

==Values and mission==
According to the PC Party website, their mission is &quot;to form a fiscally responsible, socially progressive government that promotes individual achievement and personal responsibility, is accountable to its citizens, listens to its people, embraces innovation, preserves the best of our unique heritage and diverse cultures and learns from the past&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;St. Lo&quot; (AVG/ACV/CVE–63) was a of the United States Navy during World War II. On 25 October 1944, &quot;St. Lo&quot; became the first major warship to sink as the result of a &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack. The attack occurred during the Battle off Samar, part of the larger Battle of Leyte Gulf.

==Construction==
&quot;St. Lo&quot; was laid down as Chapin Bay on 23 January 1943, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 1100; renamed Midway on 3 April 1943; launched on 17 August 1943; sponsored by Mrs Howard Nixon Coulter, commissioned on 23 October 1943.

==Service history==
&quot;Midway&quot; left Astoria, Oregon on 13 November 1943. She went dry docking on 10 April 1944. After shakedown on the west coast and two voyages to Pearl Harbor and one to Australia, carrying replacement aircraft, &quot;Midway&quot;, with Composite Squadron 65 (VC-65) embarked, joined Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan&#x27;s Carrier Support Group 1 in June, for the Mariana Islands. She provided air cover for the transports and participated in airstrikes on Saipan VC-65&#x27;s FM-2 Wildcats claimed to have shot down four and damaged one other Japanese aircraft during combat air patrol operations there.

On 13 July, she sailed for Eniwetok, for replenishment before joining the attack on Tinian, on 23 July. Furnishing air support for ground forces on the island and maintaining an anti-submarine patrol, &quot;Midway&quot; operated off Tinian, until she again headed out for supplies on 28 July.

&quot;Midway&quot; remained at anchor in Eniwetok Atoll, until she got under way on 9 August, for Seeadler Harbor, at Manus, Admiralty Islands, arriving on 13 August.

On 13 September, she sortied with Task Force 77 (TF 77) for the invasion of Morotai. Launching her first aircraft to support the landings on 15 September. She continued to assist allied troops ashore and provide cover for the transports through 22 September.

After a refueling period, &quot;Midway&quot; resumed air operations in the Palaus until returning to Seeadler Harbor on 3 October. There, word arrived that the escort carrier had been renamed &quot;St. Lo&quot;, 10 October, to free the name &quot;Midway&quot; for a new attack carrier and to commemorate the Battle of Saint-Lô, on 18 July 1944.

===Battle off Samar===

&quot;St. Lo&quot; departed Seeadler Harbor on 12 October, to participate in the liberation of Leyte. Ordered to provide air coverage and close air support during the bombardment and amphibious landings, she arrived off Leyte on 18 October. She launched airstrikes in support of invasion operations at Tacloban, on the northeast coast of Leyte. Operating with Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague&#x27;s escort carrier unit, &quot;Taffy 3&quot; (TU 77.4.3), which consisted of six escort carriers and a screen of three destroyers and four destroyer escorts, &quot;St. Lo&quot; steamed off the east coasts of Leyte and Samar and her aircraft sortied from 18 to 24 October, attacking enemy installations and airfields on Leyte and Samar islands.

Steaming about east of Samar, before dawn of 25 October, &quot;St. Lo&quot; launched a four-aircraft anti-submarine patrol while the remaining carriers of Taffy 3 prepared for the day&#x27;s initial airstrikes against the landing beaches. The Battle off Samar began at 06:47, when Ensign Bill Brooks – piloting one of the TBF Avengers from &quot;St. Lo&quot; – reported sighting a large Japanese force comprising four battleships, eight cruisers and twelve destroyers approaching from the west-northwest, only away. At the same time, lookouts on &quot;St. Lo&quot; spotted the characteristic pagoda-like superstructures of Japanese battleships on the horizon. Rear Admiral Sprague ordered Taffy 3 to turn south at flank speed. Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s force closed and by about 06:58 opened fire on the slow, outnumbered and outgunned ships of Taffy 3.

&quot;St. Lo&quot; and the other five escort carriers dodged in and out of rain squalls and managed to launch all available fighter and torpedo aircraft with whatever armament they had available. Pilots were ordered, &quot;to attack the Japanese task force and proceed to Tacloban airstrip, Leyte, to rearm and refuel&quot; as the carriers managed to dodge salvos from enemy cruisers and battleships.

By 08:00, the enemy cruisers, approaching from &quot;St. Lo&quot;″s port quarter, had closed to within . &quot;St. Lo&quot; responded with fire from her single gun, claiming three hits on a &quot;Tone&quot;-class cruiser.

For the next 90 minutes, Admiral Kurita&#x27;s ships closed in on Taffy 3, with his nearest destroyers and cruisers firing from as close as on the port and starboard quarters of &quot;St. Lo&quot;. Many salvos straddled the ship, landed close aboard, or passed directly overhead. Throughout the battle, the carriers and their escorts used smoke screens that Admiral Sprague credited with degrading Japanese gun accuracy. More effective were the attacks by the destroyers and destroyer escorts against the Japanese ships. All the while, Kurita&#x27;s force was under attack by Taffy 3 aircraft and aircraft from the two other U.S. carrier units to the south.

Under attack from the air and fire from American destroyers and destroyer escorts, the enemy cruisers broke off the action and turned north at 09:20. At 09:15, the enemy destroyers which had been kept at bay by the exploits of , and as well as the other units of Taffy 3 – launched a premature torpedo attack from . The torpedoes had nearly run out of fuel when they finally approached the escort carriers, broaching the surface. A &quot;St. Lo&quot; Avenger, piloted by Lieutenant, junior grade Tex Waldrop, strafed two torpedoes in the wake of .

===Kamikaze===
At 10:50, the task unit came under a concentrated air attack by the Shikishima Special Attack Unit. During the forty-minute engagement with enemy &quot;kamikazes&quot;, all the escort carriers except were damaged. One Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero – perhaps flown by Lieutenant Yukio Seki – crashed into the flight deck of &quot;St. Lo&quot; at 10:51. Seki was originally aiming to strike the carrier &quot;White Plains&quot; but damage from anti-aircraft fire made him change course to the &quot;St. Lo&quot;. Its bomb penetrated the flight deck and exploded on the port side of the hangar deck, where aircraft were in the process of being refueled and rearmed. A gasoline fire erupted, followed by secondary explosions, including detonations of the ship&#x27;s torpedo and bomb magazine. &quot;St. Lo&quot; was engulfed in flame and sank 30 minutes later.

Of the 889 men aboard, 113 were killed or missing and approximately 30 others died of their wounds. The survivors were rescued from the water by , , and (which picked up 434 survivors).

The wreck is located near .

<text>George Edward &quot;Jed&quot; Smock Jr. (January 4, 1943 – June 6, 2022), better known as Brother Jed, was an American evangelist whose open-air preaching ministry was concentrated on college campuses. He preached at major universities in all 50 US states and other countries. As an itinerant preacher, he usually spent only a few days on each campus, visiting the northern campuses in the fall and spring and the southern campuses in the winter. In 2004, he relocated to Columbia, Missouri, where he often preached at the University of Missouri and other colleges throughout the Midwest. In the summer of 2013, he relocated his ministry and residence to his hometown of Terre Haute, Indiana.

== Biography ==
Brother Jed&#x27;s self-described lifestyle of &quot;drunkenness, dissipation, and debauchery&quot; began while he was a freshman in high school. Older friends exposed him to alcohol, which became a regular part of his life. Smock began attending Indiana University in 1960. By his second year, he had established himself as the heaviest drinker in the fraternity. Smock would soon drop out of Indiana University and hitchhike to California, where he was a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman.

Smock would later go on to finish his undergraduate education at Indiana State University, continuing his previous lifestyle of &quot;debauchery.&quot; There he graduated with honors, majoring in Social Studies with a minor of English. Smock states in his autobiography that, despite his lifestyle, he graduated near the top of his class, going straight to the bars after taking his last senior final exam. There he was hospitalized after being punched while trying to stop a fight, leaving him with a scar on his face. Smock claims to have woken up in an emergency room with no recollection of the night before, having details being filled in by his friend, and having gone back out to the bars that same night.

Smock attended graduate school at Indiana State University, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in history and wrote a thesis on &quot;the personal effects of smoking seven straight joints of marijuana&quot; while he was a research assistant in psychology for the Institute of Research into Human Behavior at the school. Smock served as a history professor for one year at the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse.

He converted to Christianity after being preached to by an Arab carrying a cross in Morocco.

Smock formed Campus Ministry USA, a para-church organization, in 1984. In 2004, the group moved its operations from Newark, Ohio to Columbia, Missouri, where he often preached at the University of Missouri on Speakers Circle.

Brother Jed left Columbia for Indiana in 2013. His family was documented for a pilot TV series while preaching in Indiana.

Brother Jed frequented Eastern Illinois University.

== Personal life ==
Jed married Cynthia D. Lasseter Smock (who calls herself “Sister Cindy” when preaching). They have five daughters, all of whom have accompanied them on their travels and appearances on college campuses.

== Preaching style and personal views ==

Smock wrote a spiritual autobiography, &quot;Who Will Rise Up?&quot; in which he described his dissolute youth and conversion experience, and presented his justification for his confrontational style of evangelism.

Smock and his wife Cindy used a distinctive preaching style, termed &quot;confrontational evangelism&quot; in the subtitle of his autobiography. This controversial variant of evangelism is shared by some street and campus preachers, who hope that a spiritual rebuke will force sinners to repent. In his autobiography, Smock referred to his college evangelical group as &quot;The Destroyers&quot;, but this name is not presently being used on his website.

Smock was a member of the United Methodist Church, although his actions, views, and theology were not indicative of its positions.

College newspapers have reported some of his statements: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how the whorehouses in this town stay open — all of you sorority girls are giving it away for free!&quot; and &quot;Who are you, Bob Marley?&quot; (addressed to a black student with dreadlocks). He often shouted, &quot;A masturbator today is a homosexual tomorrow.&quot; His assistants carried signs declaring that feminists, liberals, and those who listen to rock and roll are destined for Hell, along with homosexuals, fornicators, those who use tampons, and masturbators. As a result of his aggressive, rude and confrontational style of preaching, Brother Jed was frequently mocked and accused of intolerance.

Besides issues relating to coarse language with immodest sexual references, Smock claimed to be sinless, holding a position called Christian perfection. He held to Pelagianism, identifying himself with the teachings of Pelagius. In addition, he held a view of God which denies that goodness is an essential attribute of God&#x27;s nature.

== Fictional portrayals ==
Smock&#x27;s character was the basis of the 2012 short, &quot;Battle of the Sects&quot;, in which an extreme evangelical preacher visits a university only to be run out by the campus Christians.

The project was started in April 2002 in response to an article on linux.com by astrophysics student Henrik Nilsen Omma.

In September 2007, project lead Chris Gray left the project to pursue his own open-source disc, called OpenDisc, citing numerous difficulties which he believed were negatively affecting the progress of the OpenCD project. As of September 27, 2007, the OpenCD project is no longer under active development.

<doc id="522916" wikidata="Q126098" url="?curid=522916" title="Michel Gondry">
<text>Michel Gondry (; born 8 May 1963) is a French filmmaker and producer noted for his inventive visual style and distinctive manipulation of mise en scène. Along with Charlie Kaufman, he won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay as one of the writers of the 2004 film &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot;, which he also directed. His other films include the music documentary &quot;Dave Chappelle&#x27;s Block Party&quot; (2005), the surrealistic science fantasy comedy &quot;The Science of Sleep&quot; (2006), the comedy &quot;Be Kind Rewind&quot; (2008), the superhero comedy &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; (2011), the drama &quot;The We and the I&quot; (2012), and the romantic science fantasy tragedy &quot;Mood Indigo&quot; (2013).

Gondry has directed numerous music videos, including Björk&#x27;s &quot;Human Behaviour&quot; in 1993 and &quot;Bachelorette&quot; in 1997, both of which earned him nominations for the Grammy Award for Best Music Video; he also directed several videos for The White Stripes. He is also a record producer, most notably producing several tracks for American rapper and illustrator MC Paul Barman on his album &quot;Thought Balloon Mushroom Cloud&quot; (2009).

==Early life==
Gondry was born in Versailles. He is the grandson of inventor Constant Martin.

==Career==
Gondry&#x27;s vision and career began with his emphasis on emotion. Much of his inspiration, he says, came from the film &quot;Le voyage en ballon&quot;. He stated: &quot;When I watch this movie, I dream I&#x27;m flying and then I do stories where people are flying. I think it&#x27;s directly influencing.&quot;

His career as a filmmaker began with creating music videos for the French rock band Oui Oui, in which he also served as a drummer. The style of his videos for Oui Oui caught the attention of music artist Björk, who asked him to direct the video for her song &quot;Human Behaviour&quot;. The collaboration proved long-lasting, with Gondry directing a total of eight music videos for Björk.

Other artists who have collaborated with Gondry on more than one occasion include Daft Punk, the White Stripes, the Chemical Brothers, the Vines, Steriogram, Radiohead, and Beck. Gondry&#x27;s video for Lucas Secon&#x27;s &quot;Lucas with the Lid Off&quot; was nominated in the Best Music Video (short form) category at the 37th Grammy Awards, (one of two Gondry music videos nominated that year along with Sinéad O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s &quot;Fire on Babylon&quot;).

Gondry has also created numerous television commercials. He pioneered the &quot;bullet time&quot; technique later adapted in &quot;The Matrix&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Smarienberg&quot; commercial for Smirnoff vodka, as well as directing a trio of inventive holiday-themed advertisements for clothing retailer Gap.

Gondry, along with directors Spike Jonze and David Fincher, is representative of the influx of music video directors into feature film. Gondry made his feature film debut in 2001 with &quot;Human Nature&quot;, garnering mixed reviews. His second film, &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; (also his second collaboration with screenwriter Charlie Kaufman), was released in 2004 and received very favorable reviews, becoming one of the most critically acclaimed films of the year.

&quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot; utilizes many of the image manipulation techniques that Gondry had experimented with in his music videos. Gondry won an Academy Award alongside Kaufman and Pierre Bismuth for the screenplay of &quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot;. The style of Gondry&#x27;s music videos often relies on videography and camera tricks which play with frames of reference.

Gondry also directed the musical documentary &quot;Dave Chappelle&#x27;s Block Party&quot; (2006) which followed comedian Dave Chappelle as he attempted to hold a large, free concert in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. His following film, &quot;The Science of Sleep&quot;, hit theaters in September 2006. This film stars Mexican actor Gael García Bernal, and marked a return to the fantastical, surreal techniques he employed in &quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot;.

According to the Guinness World Records 2004, Gondry&#x27;s Levi&#x27;s 501 Jeans &quot;Drugstore&quot; spot holds the record for &quot;Most awards won by a TV commercial&quot;. The commercial was never aired in North America because of the suggestive content involving purchasing latex condoms.

He was asked by French comic duet Éric and Ramzy to direct &quot;Seuls Two&quot;, but declined; by his suggestion, Éric and Ramzy subsequently asked Mr Oizo to direct another movie, &quot;Steak&quot;.

In September 2006, Gondry made his debut as an installation artist at Deitch Projects in New York City&#x27;s SoHo gallery district. The show, called &quot;The Science of Sleep: An Exhibition of Sculpture and Pathological Creepy Little Gifts&quot; featured props from his film, &quot;The Science of Sleep&quot;, as well as film clips and a selection of gifts that the artist had given to women he was interested in, many of them former or current collaborators, Karen Baird, Kishu Chand, Dorothy Barrick and Lauri Faggioni.

A leitmotif of the film is a &#x27;Disastrology&#x27; calendar; Gondry commissioned the painter Baptiste Ibar to draw harrowing images of natural and human disasters.

Gondry was an Artist in Residence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2005 and 2006. Later directing the music video for the Paul McCartney song &quot;Dance Tonight&quot;, in which Gondry makes a cameo appearance.

Gondry directed &quot;Unnatural Love&quot;, the fifth episode in season two of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Flight of the Conchords&quot;. Interior Design, one third of the 2008 anthology film &quot;Tokyo!&quot;, was next for Gondry. Interior Design was based on the comic book &quot;Cecil and Jordan in New York&quot; by Gabrielle Bell but was adapted from New York City to Tokyo for the film.

In 2009, &quot;The Thorn in the Heart&quot;, another feature documentary, was released, it is about Michel&#x27;s aunt Suzette and her son Jean-Yves. In 2011, Gondry directed &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, a superhero film by Sony starring Seth Rogen, Jay Chou and Christoph Waltz; Rogen co-wrote the script. In 2011, he was the head of the jury for the short film competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.

His film &quot;The We and the I&quot; was selected to be screened in the Directors&#x27; Fortnight section at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.

On 3 January 2013, Gondry released his latest animated short &quot;Haircut Mouse&quot; on his official Vimeo channel. In February 2013, Gondry released a hand-drawn animated documentary on famed linguist Noam Chomsky, &quot;Is the Man Who is Tall Happy?&quot;.

In April 2013, his &quot;Mood Indigo&quot; was released, based upon Boris Vian&#x27;s 1947 novel &quot;L&#x27;Écume des Jours&quot;.

In 2014, he was selected as a member of the jury for the 64th Berlin International Film Festival. Also in 2014, Gondry produced the video for Metronomy&#x27;s single &quot;Love Letters&quot;, taken from the album of the same name.

In 2015 his feature film &quot;Microbe &amp; Gasoline&quot; was released, a smaller scale endeavour after the troubled production of &quot;Mood Indigo&quot;. The latter also served as inspiration for 2023&#x27;s The Book of Solutions.

In 2024, his first animated film,&quot;Maya, Give Me a Title&quot; was released, his daughter, Maya Gondry, voiced herself in the film, Pierre Niney voiced a character in the film as well, it also has a short live-action sequence.

== Personal life==
His brother Olivier &quot;Twist&quot; Gondry is also a television commercial and music video director creating videos for bands such as The Stills, Hot Hot Heat, Daft Punk and The Vines.

He has a son named Paul, and a daughter named Maya.

<doc id="522918" wikidata="Q2305638" url="?curid=522918" title="Shere Khan">
<text>Shere Khan () is a fictional Bengal tiger in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Book&quot; and its adaptations. He is often portrayed as the main antagonist, itself an exaggeration of his role in the original stories, in which he only appears a third of the time. Shere Khan is named after Afghan Emperor Sher Shah Suri. &quot;Khan&quot; is a title of distinction among the Turco-Mongol peoples, usually meaning &quot;chief&quot; or &quot;ruler&quot;. According to The Kipling Society, the name shows that Shere Khan &quot;is the chief among tigers&quot;.

==The original &quot;Jungle Book&quot; stories==
Shere Khan is depicted by Kipling as having been born with a crippled leg, so his mother gave him the derisive nickname &quot;Lungri&quot; (&quot;The Lame One&quot;). Despite this condition, Shere Khan is prideful and regards himself as the &quot;rightful&quot; lord of the jungle. The only creature who looks up to him is Tabaqui, a spineless and hated golden jackal.

In &quot;Mowgli&#x27;s Brothers&quot;, Shere Khan&#x27;s failed attempt to hunt humans causes a human &quot;cub&quot; to stray from its parents. When Shere Khan discovers the infant, it has been adopted by Indian wolves, Raksha and Father Wolf, who have named the child Mowgli. Mowgli is accepted into Akela&#x27;s wolf pack and is protected by Bagheera (a panther) and Baloo (a bear). Furious at losing his kill, the tiger swears that the boy will be his some day. While Mowgli is growing up, Shere Khan infiltrates the wolf pack by promising the younger wolves rich rewards once Akela is deposed. When the young wolves manoeuvre Akela into missing his kill, the pack council meets to kill and replace him. Shere Khan threatens to take over their hunting territory if the wolves do not give him Mowgli. Having been warned by Bagheera, Mowgli attacks Shere Khan and his allies with a burning branch (the mysterious and powerful &quot;red flower&quot; of man) and drives them away. Akela leaves the pack to become a lone hunter. Mowgli goes to the human village but swears that he will return one day with Shere Khan&#x27;s skin.

Shere Khan also appears in the story &quot;How Fear Came&quot;, which is set between the first and second halves of the &quot;Mowgli&#x27;s Brothers&quot;, and probably sometime after &quot;Kaa&#x27;s Hunting&quot;. In this story the tiger comes to drink from the river just after having killed a human purely for sport, leading &quot;Hathi&quot; the elephant to tell the story of why tigers, out of all the animals in the jungle, are allowed to hunt humans for pleasure at certain times. This story, in which Mowgli appears mainly as an observer, may be seen as a direct ancestor of Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Just So Stories&quot;.

In &quot;Tiger! Tiger!&quot;, Mowgli is adopted by Messua and her husband and learns human ways. In this short story, Mowgli learns the villagers have heard of the tiger Shere Khan, who also has a bounty on his head, but believe the tiger&#x27;s lame because he is the reincarnation of a money-lender injured in a riot. When Mowgli scoffs at these fanciful tales, the villagers decide to put him to work herding buffalo. He then meets his wolf friend Grey Brother, who tells him that Shere Khan is still planning to kill him. Grey Brother forces Tabaqui to tell him where and when Shere Khan is planning to strike, then kills the jackal. With the help of Akela, Grey Brother and Mowgli trap Shere Khan in a narrow canyon and incite the buffalo to stampede him to death.

==In adaptations and other media==
===Disney versions===

====&quot;The Jungle Book&quot;====

In Disney&#x27;s 1967 animated adaptation of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, Shere Khan&#x27;s voice was performed by George Sanders, while his singing voice was provided by Bill Lee and Thurl Ravenscroft and his roars were performed by Jimmy MacDonald. He was designed and animated by animator Milt Kahl. The inhabitants of the jungle fear him greatly; mere news of his being in the vicinity compels the wolf pack to send Mowgli away. Man&#x27;s gun and fire are the only things Shere Khan fears, and consequently, he feels the urge to kill humans whenever the opportunity presents itself. Shere Khan first appears about two-thirds of the way through the film where, after having been interrupted during a hunt by Colonel Hathi, he eavesdrops on Bagheera asking the elephants to help search for a now-lost Mowgli and sets out to find and kill the boy. He later encounters Kaa just as he was going to eat Mowgli, but the snake denies any knowledge of the man-cub. Doubting Kaa&#x27;s honesty, Shere Khan threatens Kaa into showing his middle by loosening his coils, inadvertently allowing Mowgli to escape after which the tiger resumes his search.

In the climax, Shere Khan finds Mowgli, who refuses to run and instead stands up against the tiger, saying that he is not afraid. Impressed by Mowgli&#x27;s bravery, Shere Khan, for his own amusement, gives him a 10-second head start to run away. But Mowgli still refuses and grabs a stick, intent on fighting the tiger. Shere Khan becomes annoyed and immediately attempts to attack Mowgli, who flinches in fear, finally understanding the true danger of the ferocious beast. Fortunately, Baloo arrives in the nick of time and grabs Shere Khan by the tail. Mowgli then hits Shere Khan with his stick. Enraged, he chases Mowgli while dragging Baloo behind him, but the vultures manage to fly Mowgli to safety. Baloo&#x27;s interference proves such a nuisance to Shere Khan that he decides to savage the bear, nearly killing him. Upon learning that Shere Khan is afraid of fire, Mowgli grabs a burning branch from a tree struck by a bolt of lightning, and the vultures distract Shere Khan long enough for Mowgli to tie the branch to his tail. Shere Khan panics and is forced to flee.

====&quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot;====
Shere Khan returned (and had more on-screen time) in &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot;. Humiliated by the ordeal of his tail being tied to a burning branch in the original film, the tiger has sworn to kill Mowgli for revenge. He first searches the Man Village and is chased off by the villagers. He then searches the jungle for Mowgli and is lied to by Kaa, who tells him that Mowgli is at the swamp out of fear, and being pestered by Lucky, a new but dim-witted member of the vultures, who accidentally reveals Mowgli&#x27;s whereabouts before Shere Khan violently attacks him for his jokes, causing the other 4 vultures to fly away in fear. Shere Khan and Mowgli ultimately meet again as Mowgli tries to reconcile with Shanti and Ranjan, who, unbeknownst to him, were cornered by the tiger at that very moment. Barely escaping, Mowgli hides in an abandoned temple surrounded by lava. Shanti, Ranjan, Baloo, and Bagheera hurry to save Mowgli. After Baloo and Shanti team up, they, along with Mowgli, confuse Shere Khan by banging three different gongs. Eventually, Shanti&#x27;s gong collapses, giving away her hiding place. Shere Khan threatens to kill Shanti instead unless Mowgli comes out of hiding, forcing Mowgli to reveal himself. Shere Khan then chases the two of them, despite Baloo&#x27;s efforts to slow him down. Mowgli and Shanti jump over a pit of molten lava and grab onto the head of a tiger statue. Shere Khan leaps across and corners the children. Before he can kill them, the statue falls under his weight taking the three of them with it. Shanti and Mowgli are saved by Baloo while Shere Khan falls onto a stone slab in the lava pit, and the statue lands on top of him, trapping him inside its mouth. He is last seen being taunted by Lucky. In &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot;, Shere Khan was voiced by Tony Jay, who reprised his role from the Disney Afternoon series &quot;TaleSpin&quot;.

====&quot;TaleSpin&quot;====
Shere Khan appeared in the 1990-1991 Disney Afternoon series &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, which anthropomorphised a number of animal characters from the 1967 &quot;Jungle Book&quot;. Khan was depicted as the wealthy mogul of Khan Industries in the harbour city of Cape Suzette. He was a nominal villain who occasionally took enjoyment in driving small companies out of business to expand his own enterprise, but sometimes allied with the heroes when it suited him. Tony Jay provided his voice, and would do so again in &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot; (2003), which restored Khan to a more conventional portrayal.

====1994 live-action film====
In the 1994 live-action film &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, Shere Khan is presented as a more sympathetic character. In the film, Shere Khan does not kill for sport, and his sole goal is to protect the jungle from those who break &quot;the laws of the jungle&quot; (the most basic of which are killing to eat or to keep from being eaten), including humans who trespass with guns and kill animals for fun instead of food. At the beginning of the film, he sees two British guards and a hunter named Buldeo shooting animals for sport and becomes enraged at this. That night, he attacks the humans&#x27; camp in revenge for the animals&#x27; death and kills Mowgli&#x27;s father Nathoo in response to him defending Buldeo. Other than killing Nathoo, Shere Khan also kills a guard and a British sergeant named Claiborne, both of whom were responsible for the jungle law being broken alongside Buldeo. This event is what led Mowgli to be separated from civilization and to live in the jungle to survive.

Shere Khan is not seen again until the second half of the film, which takes place twenty years after the first act, when he spots several hunters (led by Captain William Boone) and roars to announce his approach. He goes on to maul Lieutenant Wilkins (a henchman of Boone) to death when he gets separated. Following Boone&#x27;s death by Kaa, Shere Khan and Mowgli meet face to face for the first time. Shere Khan is obviously distrusting of Mowgli and all humans. He attempts to scare Mowgli away by roaring in his face, but Mowgli stubbornly roars back and stares Shere Khan down. Seeing Mowgli&#x27;s courage, Shere Khan develops a newfound respect for him, and begins to see him as a fellow &quot;creature of the jungle&quot;. Because of this, Shere Khan spares Mowgli and allows him and his friend Katherine Brydon to leave peacefully.

====&quot;Jungle Cubs&quot;====
Shere Khan also appears in the 1996 Disney animated series &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot;, where he is a tiger cub. He is more of a bully than a predator but is friends with the other characters. Shere Khan is voiced by Jason Marsden. The producers originally wanted Shere Khan to keep his British accent for the show, but later changed their mind, and Shere Khan ended up with an American accent, completely different from that of his adult version. The adult version of himself appears in the &quot;Jungle Cubs: Born to be Wild&quot; video (again voiced by Tony Jay), and in these cut scenes, he attempts to kill Mowgli when Mowgli, Baloo and Bagheera walk into his part of the jungle. Baloo and Bagheera try to reason with Shere Khan by recounting the &quot;Red Dogs&quot; story, in which they and the other animals saved Shere Khan&#x27;s life, but Shere Khan refuses to listen and says to them the past is the past. Baloo then throws a stone at a beehive and grabs Shere Khan by the head, letting go only when the beehive falls on his head. Shere Khan, with the beehive still on his head, runs away from the angry bees.

====&quot;The Jungle Book: Mowgli&#x27;s Story&quot;====
Shere Khan appears once again as a villain in the 1998 film &quot;The Jungle Book: Mowgli&#x27;s Story&quot;, where he is voiced by Sherman Howard and accompanied by his sidekick Tabaqui, who in this version is a spotted hyena. In the film, he kills Raksha in Monkey Town when she comes to rescue Mowgli. During the final battle, Mowgli uses fire in order to banish Shere Khan from his jungle. Shere Khan complies and leaves the jungle.

====2016 live-action/CGI hybrid film====

Idris Elba voices Shere Khan in the 2016 live-action film &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. In this incarnation, Shere Khan has several noticeable burns, including a blinded left eye. He also hates humans and views them all as a threat, much as his previous Disney incarnation does. When interviewed regarding the character, Elba described Shere Khan as the &quot;lord of the jungle&quot;, a creature &quot;that reigns with fear&quot; and that he &quot;terrorizes everyone he encounters because he comes from a place of fear.&quot;

Shere Khan first appears during the drought, when the animals gather to drink at Peace Rock, a watering hole where the animals maintain a water truce not to devour each other while quenching their thirst. Upon scenting Mowgli, he threatens to kill him as man is not allowed to live in the jungle. Raksha, Mowgli&#x27;s adoptive mother, retorts that they do not see him as the jungle&#x27;s ruler; and that he has no right to dictate rules since he breaks them himself. This causes Akela and his wolf pack to debate whether to have Mowgli leave. When Mowgli leaves the wolf pack with Bagheera, Shere Khan ambushes him en route and fights with Bagheera. Though Shere Khan defeats and mildly injures Bagheera, Mowgli escapes with the aid of a stampeding water buffalo herd. During Kaa&#x27;s attempt to hypnotize Mowgli, she reveals that Shere Khan himself is responsible for Mowgli being found by Bagheera, as he killed Mowgli&#x27;s father (an event that left him with his burns and even more passionate hatred for humans).

Shere Khan later returns to confront Akela&#x27;s pack and demand Mowgli is turned over to him, killing Akela by grabbing him in his jaws and throwing the wolf leader off a cliff when he learns that Mowgli is on his way to the Man-village. He then assumes control of the wolves, confident that Mowgli will return as he orders them to spread the word. Later that night, Shere Khan tells the wolf pups the story of the cuckoo bird as an insult to Raksha. He admits to Raksha that he never wanted Mowgli to leave the jungle, he wanted him dead.

When Mowgli hears of Akela&#x27;s death, he returns to face Shere Khan at the river with a burning torch stolen from the Man-village. Shere Khan points out that he has accidentally started a wildfire in the process, and that the animals now have more reason to fear Mowgli than Shere Khan. When Mowgli throws away the torch, Shere Khan attempts to attack the now unarmed Mowgli; but is blocked by Baloo, Bagheera and the wolf pack who are inspired by Mowgli&#x27;s courage and stand up to Shere Khan while reciting the mantra of the wolf. Infuriated by this defiance and insult to his self-proclaimed reign, he roars in fury while unleashing his true behavior as a vicious tiger; now attempting to kill all the animals just to get to Mowgli. However, the combined efforts of Baloo, Bagheera and the wolf pack keep him distracted long enough for Mowgli to set a trap in the burning jungle nearby. During their battle, Mowgli lures Shere Khan onto a dead strangler fig tree and eventually defeats him by causing him to fall roaring to his death into the fires below.

==== Other ====
In the &quot;Descendants&quot; novel &quot;The Isle of the Lost&quot;, Shere Khan is shown as an inmate of the Isle of the Lost. He is shown to have a soft spot for the Evil Queen&#x27;s daughter Evie.

Shere Khan was to appear in cancelled Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book 3&quot;, a sequel to Disney&#x27;s original animated films where he and Baloo were to be taken to a Russian circus and Shere Khan was to change his ways and become good.

=== &quot;Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle&quot; (2018) ===
In the 2018 live-action film &quot;&quot;, Shere Khan is portrayed in motion-capture and voice-over by Benedict Cumberbatch. This version of Shere Khan bears a closer resemblance to his novel counterpart in that he is crippled with a deformed front leg. He is also considerably more sinister than previous incarnations as he continually strives to gain more power and influence among the jungle&#x27;s creatures as he seeks to kill Mowgli. Shere Khan first appears in the beginning of the film breaking jungle law by killing Mowgli&#x27;s parents. When the infant Mowgli escapes him thanks to the intervention of Bagheera and the wolf pack, Shere Khan is informed of his whereabouts by his hyena minion Tabaqui and challenges Akela for him. When this fails, Shere Khan leaves for many years until he announces his return by killing man&#x27;s cattle and leaving it for Baloo and the pack to find. He also pursues Mowgli during the latter&#x27;s swim and subsequent escape, but fails to catch him after Mowgli falls into a tiger pit and an elephant rescues him. Shere Khan next appears when the Bandar-Log monkeys bring Mowgli to him on Tabaqui&#x27;s orders, where he tries to eat Mowgli while the boy has been knocked unconscious. The intervention of Baloo, Bagheera and Kaa stops Shere Khan, and he waits until Akela is challenged for leadership to try and claim the boy again after Akela fails to catch a deer, but Mowgli drives him away with a burning branch taken from the Man-Village. Afterwards, Shere Khan divides the wolf pack with his followers haranguing and raiding Akela&#x27;s pack and their allies. Mowgli, having lived in the Man-Village and seeking to rid the jungle of the tiger&#x27;s influence, calls out Shere Khan. The boy then faces off against the tiger, aided by the elephants before he manages to mortally wound Shere Khan. However, the hunter pursuing Shere Khan, John Lockwood, accidentally grazes Mowgli with a bullet and shoots Akela as he stops the tiger from killing Mowgli causing the elephant whose tusk was shot off by Lockwood to intervene and kill the hunter to prevent more death. As the other animals rally to Mowgli, Shere Khan slinks away and collapses, playing dead to try and lure Mowgli in. Mowgli fails to let his guard down and kills Shere Khan with his knife as the tiger tries to kill him, ending his reign of terror once and for all.

===Other appearances===
* Shere Khan appeared in the 1942 film adaptation by the Hungarian brothers, Zoltan and Alexander Korda, with the screenplay written by Laurence Stallings.

<doc id="522920" wikidata="Q5464154" url="?curid=522920" title="Foil kite">
<text>Foil kites are soft kites based on the design of the parafoil. They consist of a number of cells running fore to aft, some or all of which are open at the front to allow air to inflate the kite so it takes on an aerofoil section. Due to the amount of power that these kites can generate, they can be used for a variety of different activities including kitesurfing, kite landboarding, snowkiting, kite buggying, kite-energy systems or airborne wind energy, and recreational kiting.

Foil kites are flown with various line set-ups that includes 2-, 3- and 4-line systems; 2-line systems consisting of rings, wrist bands or bar compared to depowerable 4-line systems using a bar or handles. (See also: kite control systems)

In order to make them suitable for use on water some foils have limited air inlets in the centre of the leading edge, with valves to keep the air in and (hopefully) the water out. Internal holes in the cell sides allow the whole kite to inflate. These kites are naturally slower to inflate than an open-fronted foil.

Foils are the most efficient of the power kites. The aerofoil section means that they can still provide significant lift when parked overhead, unlike leading edge inflatable kites.

==Development and history of foil kites==
One of the first popular foil-based kites was the development of a two-line power kite by Ray Merry and Andrew Jones in the early 1970s in England which became known as the &quot;Flexifoil&quot; (and later the Flexifoil company). Merry and Jones also experimented with kite pulled vehicles, a concept which was further developed by Peter Lynn and popular today in its current form as kite buggying.

The &quot;Flexifoil&quot; kite, still sold today as a &#x27;Stacker&#x27; has a solid carbon spar in its leading edge to maintain its shape as it flies.

The second-generation two-line parafoil was called the &quot;Sparless Stunter&quot;, designed by Ted Dougherty. Development began mid-1985 and was available for sale in mid-1988. These parafoil kites were square in shape and had 6 cells. In September 1988 a version was flown at the Ocean City Sunfest breaking the record for the World&#x27;s Largest Stunt kite. In January 1989 the &quot;Sparless Stunter&quot; was introduced at the KTA show as the first totally sparless parafoil stunt kite. The Sparless Stunter saw a very brief history as kite technology evolved by May 1990 the first version of the original &quot;Quadrifoil&quot; was flown in competition at Wildwood, NJ. The first &quot;Quadrifoil&quot; was essentially two &quot;Sparless Stunter&quot;s sewn together with a swept back shape. Later generations were refined into the widely known “classic.”

Peter Lynn introduced a similar foil-based kite in 1991 for kite traction with the Peter Lynn &quot;Peel&quot; – this was a completely soft foil kite without any spars. The &quot;Peel&quot; was a popular kite traction kite in the early to mid-1990s and continued to sell into the late 1990s and was sold in sizes up to 10 m2. The Peel was also a two-line kite flown in the same style as the &quot;Flexifoil&quot;.

The next evolution on the foil kites for traction activities was the development of the 4-line foil kite. While 2-line kites require sometimes significant push and pull arm movement to fly (especially true the larger the kite), the development of the 4-line kite required less arm movement. 4-line kites are flown with two lines on each handle: a top line (or power line), and a bottom line (or brake line). 4-line kites can still be flown with push and pull arm movement, but if the bottom brake line is pulled in the bottom edge of the kite stalls and will cause the kite to turn on that bottom edge. This results in tighter turns with less arm movement – this is important if sitting in a kite buggy.

One of the first available 4-line kites was the &quot;Quadrifoil&quot;, designed by Ted Dougherty, popular as a buggy kite in the mid-1990s. The &quot;Quadrifoil&quot; in its original design became known as the &#x27;Classic&#x27; – the kite was rectangular in shape in contrast to today&#x27;s more elliptical designs. Later evolutions of the kite were sold as the Competition (more elliptical in design – C1, C3), Q2000 range, and lastly the &quot;Competition X&quot; range (XXS, XS, XM, XL and the XXL). Although these were sold under the Quadrifoil brand-name by Active People, none of these were designed by Dougherty himself.

Dougherty&#x27;s next kite after the &quot;Quadrifoil&quot; was the &quot;QuadTrac&quot; built and sold by Skynasaur in the US in the mid-1990s.

Following the success of the &quot;Quadrifoil&quot;, Ray Merry (of &quot;Flexifoil&quot; fame) designed the &quot;Skytiger&quot; range of 4-line kites that was the dominant 4-line traction kite of the mid to late 1990s. This too was a rectangular design and a very solid and stable flying kite. The design was refined for more pull with the introduction of the &#x27;Hi&#x27; series with an increased aspect ratio (wing). Commonly available were the Hi-22, Hi-40 (3.7 metre) and the Hi-60 (5.6 metre). A Hi-80 and Hi-100 were also available although not commonly seen. The &#x27;Hi&#x27; series was available in regular ripstop nylon, or also available made from &#x27;Icarex&#x27;, a lightweight polyester material that allowed the kites to fly in much lower winds.

In Europe in the late 1990s the kite buggy scene was becoming popular and there were a large number of traction kite designs from a large number of European companies. The designs took two different directions – those that were steady and reliable in most winds and typically resistant to &#x27;luffing&#x27; in gusty or unreliable winds, and those that were tuned to produce maximum pull at the cost of stability (known as &#x27;race kites&#x27;). In the UK in the late 1990s, the &#x27;Predator&#x27; kite designed by Peter Mirkovic of Sky Kites was the most popular and successful traction kite amongst people competing in buggy races, winning the majority of races at this time.

By late 1990s/early 2000s a number of new companies entered the traction kite market that had prior experience with development of paragliders, and used this knowledge and experience for the development of traction kites.

<doc id="522921" wikidata="Q1147559" url="?curid=522921" title="Very Long Baseline Array">
<text>The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) is a system of ten radio telescopes which are operated remotely from their Array Operations Center located in Socorro, New Mexico, as a part of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). These ten radio antennas work together as an array that forms the longest system in the world that uses very long baseline interferometry. The longest baseline available in this interferometer is about .

The construction of the VLBA began in February 1986 and it was completed in May 1993. The first astrometrical observation using all ten antennas was carried out on May 29, 1993. The total cost of building the VLBA was about $85 million. The array is funded by the National Science Foundation, and costs about $10 million a year to operate.

Each receiver in the VLBA consists of a parabolic dish antenna 25 meters (82 feet) in diameter, along with its adjacent control building. This contains the supporting electronics and machinery for the receiver, including low-noise electronics, digital computers, data storage units, and the antenna-pointing machinery. Each of the antennas is about as tall as a ten-story building when the antenna is pointed straight up, and each antenna weighs about 218 metric tons (240 short tons).

The signals from each antenna are recorded on a bank of approximately one-terabyte hard disc drives, and the information is time-stamped using atomic clocks. Once the disc drives are loaded with information, they are carried to the Pete V. Domenici Science Operations Center at the NRAO in Socorro. There, the information undergoes signal processing in a powerful set of digital computers that carry out the interferometry. These computers also make corrections for the rotation of the Earth, the slight shifts in the crust of the Earth over time, and other small measurement errors.

== Observations by the VLBA ==
The Very Long Baseline Array usually makes radio observations at wavelengths from three millimeters to 90 centimeters, or in other words, at frequencies from 0.3 gigahertz to 96 gigahertz. Within this frequency range, the VLBA observes in eight different frequency bands that are useful for radio astronomy. The VLBA also makes observations in two narrow radio bands below one gigahertz that include spectral lines produced by bright maser emissions.

The VLBA radio telescopes are located at:



==High-Sensitivity Array==
The use of the VLBA can be scheduled dynamically, and its sensitivity can be improved by a factor of five by including other radio telescopes such as the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico and the Effelsberg radio telescope in Germany. These three additional sites are brought online for as much as 100 hours per four-month trimester. In this configuration, the entire array is known as the High-Sensitivity Array (HSA). The Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico was also used, before it collapsed.

==Baseline distance and angular resolution==
Distance between each VLBA baseline (km):

The longest baseline in the array is .

<text>Apache Lucene is a free and open-source search engine software library, originally written in Java by Doug Cutting. It is supported by the Apache Software Foundation and is released under the Apache Software License. Lucene is widely used as a standard foundation for production search applications.

Lucene has been ported to other programming languages including Object Pascal, Perl, C#, C++, Python, Ruby and PHP.

==History==
Doug Cutting originally wrote Lucene in 1999. Lucene was his fifth search engine. He had previously written two while at Xerox PARC, one at Apple, and a fourth at Excite. It was initially available for download from its home at the SourceForge web site. It joined the Apache Software Foundation&#x27;s Jakarta family of open-source Java products in September 2001 and became its own top-level Apache project in February 2005. The name Lucene is Doug Cutting&#x27;s wife&#x27;s middle name and her maternal grandmother&#x27;s first name.

Lucene formerly included a number of sub-projects, such as Lucene.NET, Mahout, Tika and Nutch. These three are now independent top-level projects.

In March 2010, the Apache Solr search server joined as a Lucene sub-project, merging the developer communities.

Version 4.0 was released on October 12, 2012.

In March 2021, Lucene changed its logo, and Apache Solr became a top level Apache project again, independent from Lucene.

==Features and common use==
While suitable for any application that requires full text indexing and searching capability, Lucene is recognized for its utility in the implementation of Internet search engines and local, single-site searching.

Lucene includes a feature to perform a fuzzy search based on edit distance.

Lucene has also been used to implement recommendation systems. For example, Lucene&#x27;s &#x27;MoreLikeThis&#x27; Class can generate recommendations for similar documents. In a comparison of the term vector-based similarity approach of &#x27;MoreLikeThis&#x27; with citation-based document similarity measures, such as co-citation and co-citation proximity analysis, Lucene&#x27;s approach excelled at recommending documents with very similar structural characteristics and more narrow relatedness. In contrast, citation-based document similarity measures tended to be more suitable for recommending more broadly related documents, meaning citation-based approaches may be more suitable for generating serendipitous recommendations, as long as documents to be recommended contain in-text citations.

==Lucene-based projects==
Lucene itself is just an indexing and search library and does not contain crawling and HTML parsing functionality. However, several projects extend Lucene&#x27;s capability:
* Apache Nutch – provides web crawling and HTML parsing
* Apache Solr – an enterprise search server
* CrateDB – open source, distributed SQL database built on Lucene
* DocFetcher – a multiplatform desktop search application
* Elasticsearch – an enterprise search server released in 2010
* Kinosearch – a search engine written in Perl and C and a loose port of Lucene. The Socialtext wiki software uses this search engine, and so does the MojoMojo wiki. It is also used by the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and the Toxin and Toxin-Target Database (T3DB).
* MongoDB Atlas Search – a cloud-native enterprise search application based on MongoDB and Apache Lucene
*OpenSearch – an open source enterprise search server based on a fork of Elasticsearch 7
* Swiftype – an enterprise search startup based on Lucene

<text>The cost of living is the cost of maintaining a certain standard of living for an individual or a household. Changes in the cost of living over time can be measured in a cost-of-living index. Cost of living calculations are also used to compare the cost of maintaining a certain standard of living in different geographic areas. Differences in the cost of living between locations can be measured in terms of purchasing power parity rates. A sharp rise in the cost of living can trigger a cost of living crisis, where purchasing power is lost and, for some people, their previous lifestyle is no longer affordable.

The link between income and health is well-established. Cost of living pressures may lead to household energy insecurity or fuel poverty as well as housing stress.

==Definition==

Cost of living is the cost of maintaining a certain standard of living. Changes in the cost of living over time can be operationalized in a cost-of-living index. Cost of living calculations can be used to compare the cost of maintaining a certain standard of living in different geographic areas. Differences in cost of living between locations can be measured in terms of purchasing power parity rates.

Major components of the cost of living include food, housing costs and energy. Energy costs include heating, light and cooking costs. In the United Kingdom, about 18% of an average home&#x27;s energy costs relate to the cost of heating water.

==Cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)==

Employment contracts and pension benefits can be tied to a cost-of-living index, typically to the consumer price index (CPI). A COLA adjusts salaries based on changes in a cost-of-living index. Salaries are typically adjusted annually. They may also be tied to a cost-of-living index that varies by geographic location if the employee moves. In this latter case, the expatriate employee will likely see only the discretionary income part of their salary indexed by a differential CPI between the new and old employment locations, leaving the non-discretionary part of the salary (e.g., mortgage payments, insurance, car payments) unmodified.

Annual escalation clauses in employment contracts can specify retroactive or future percentage increases in worker pay which are not tied to any index. These negotiated increases in pay are colloquially referred to as cost-of-living adjustments or cost-of-living increases because of their similarity to increases tied to externally determined indexes. The cost-of-living allowance is equal to the nominal interest minus the real interest rate.

== Consumer Price Index (CPI) ==

When cost-of-living adjustments, negotiated wage settlements and budgetary increases exceed &quot;CPI&quot;, media reports frequently compare the two without consideration of the pertinent tax code. However, CPI is based on the retail pricing of a basket of goods and services. Most purchases of that same basket require the use of after-tax dollars—dollars that were often subject to the highest &quot;marginal tax rate&quot;. Consequently, the COLA will necessarily have to exceed the CPI inflation rate to maintain purchasing power.

The widely recognized problem known as bracket creep can also occur in countries where the marginal tax brackets themselves are not indexed — COLA increases simply place more dollars into higher tax rate brackets. Only under a flat tax system would a percentage gain on gross income translate into a comparable inflation-offsetting gain at the after-tax level.

Some salaries and pensions in the United States with a COLA include:
* Social Security
* Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS)
* Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS)

Pensions in Canada with a COLA include:
* Canadian Auto Workers union (CAW) Local 200 (Ontario)

== Social security benefits ==
===United States===
Social security benefits in the United States receive cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) to match increases in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). They can also receive funds from public charities for specific issues. The COLAs are made at most annually and are calculated based on the value of the CPI-W in the third quarter of the year (averaging the values from July, August, and September). COLAs can only increase benefits, so in deflationary years when the CPI-W drops there is no COLA.

==Worldwide survey==
The Economist Intelligence Unit produces a semi-annual (twice yearly) worldwide cost of living survey that compares more than 400 individual prices across 160 products and services. They include food, drink, clothing, household supplies and personal care items, home rents, transport, utility bills, private schools, domestic help and recreational costs.

The survey itself is an internet tool designed to calculate cost-of-living allowances and build compensation packages for corporate executives maintaining a western lifestyle. The survey incorporates easy-to-understand comparative cost of living indices between cities. The survey allows city-to-city comparisons, but for the purpose of this report all cities are compared to a base city of New York City, which has an index set at 100. The survey has been carried out for more than 30 years.

The most recent survey was published in March 2017. Singapore remains the most expensive city in the world for the fourth year running, in a rare occurrence where the entire top five most expensive cities were unchanged from the year prior. Sydney and Melbourne have both cemented their positions as top-ten staples, with Sydney becoming the fifth most expensive, and Melbourne becoming the sixth. Asia is home to more than five most expensive cities in the top twenty but also home to eight cheapest cities of the cheapest ten.

== Rising cost of living ==
Larry Summers estimated in 2007 that the lower 80% of families were receiving $664 billion less income than they would be with a 1979 income distribution, or approximately $7,000 per family. Not receiving this income may have led many families to increase their debt burden, a significant factor in the 2007–2009 subprime mortgage crisis, as highly leveraged homeowners suffered a much larger reduction in their net worth during the crisis. Further, since lower income families tend to spend relatively more of their income than higher income families, shifting more of the income to wealthier families may slow economic growth.

The 2022 World Inequality Report, a four-year research project organized by the economists Lucas Chancel, Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez, and Gabriel Zucman, shows that &quot;the world is marked by a very high level of income inequality and an extreme level of wealth inequality&quot;. According to the report, the bottom half of the population owns 2% of global wealth, while the top 10% owns 76% of it. The top 1% owns 38%.

==Other uses ==

Stipends or extra pay provided to employees who are being temporarily relocated may also be called cost-of-living adjustments or cost-of-living allowances. Such adjustments are intended to offset changes in welfare due to geographic differences in the cost of living. Such adjustments might more accurately be described as a per diem allowance or tied to a specific item, as with housing allowances. Employees who are being permanently relocated are less likely to receive such allowances, but may receive a base salary adjustment to reflect local market conditions.

A non-taxable cost-of-living allowance is frequently given to members of the U.S. military stationed at overseas bases if the area to which a service member is assigned has a higher cost of living than the average area in the United States. For example, service members stationed in Japan receive a cost of living allowance of between $300 and $700 per month (depending on pay grade, years of service, and number of dependents), in addition to their base pay.

<doc id="522936" wikidata="Q1616189" url="?curid=522936" title="Fallacy of division">
<text>The fallacy of division is an informal fallacy that occurs when one reasons that something that is true for a whole must also be true of all or some of its parts.

An example:

# The second grade in Jefferson Elementary eats a lot of ice cream
# Carlos is a second-grader in Jefferson Elementary
# Therefore, Carlos eats a lot of ice cream

The converse of this fallacy is called fallacy of composition, which arises when one fallaciously attributes a property of some part of a thing to the thing as a whole.

If a system as a whole has some property that none of its constituents has (or perhaps, it has it but not as a &quot;result&quot; of some constituent&#x27;s having that property), this is sometimes called an &quot;emergent&quot; property of the system.

The term &quot;mereological fallacy&quot; refers to approximately the same incorrect inference that properties of a whole are also properties of its parts.

== History ==
Both the fallacy of division and the fallacy of composition were addressed by Aristotle in &quot;Sophistical Refutations&quot;.

In the philosophy of the ancient Greek Anaxagoras, as claimed by the Roman atomist Lucretius, it was assumed that the atoms constituting a substance must themselves have the salient observed properties of that substance: so atoms of water would be wet, atoms of iron would be hard, atoms of wool would be soft, etc. This doctrine is called &quot;homoeomeria&quot;, and it depends on the fallacy of division.

==Examples in statistics==

In statistics an ecological fallacy is a logical fallacy in the interpretation of statistical data where inferences about the nature of individuals are deduced from inference for the group to which those individuals belong. The four common statistical ecological fallacies are: confusion between ecological correlations and individual correlations, confusion between group average and total average, Simpson&#x27;s paradox, and other statistical methods.

<text>In cryptography, a ciphertext-only attack (COA) or known ciphertext attack is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the attacker is assumed to have access only to a set of ciphertexts. While the attacker has no channel providing access to the plaintext prior to encryption, in all practical ciphertext-only attacks, the attacker still has some knowledge of the plaintext. For instance, the attacker might know the language in which the plaintext is written or the expected statistical distribution of characters in the plaintext. Standard protocol data and messages are commonly part of the plaintext in many deployed systems, and can usually be guessed or known efficiently as part of a ciphertext-only attack on these systems. 

==Attack==
The attack is completely successful if the corresponding plaintexts can be deduced, or even better, the key. The ability to obtain any information at all about the underlying plaintext beyond what was pre-known to the attacker is still considered a success. For example, if an adversary is sending ciphertext continuously to maintain traffic-flow security, it would be very useful to be able to distinguish real messages from nulls. Even making an informed guess of the existence of real messages would facilitate traffic analysis. 

In the history of cryptography, early ciphers, implemented using pen-and-paper, were routinely broken using ciphertexts alone. Cryptographers developed statistical techniques for attacking ciphertext, such as frequency analysis. Mechanical encryption devices such as Enigma made these attacks much more difficult (although, historically, Polish cryptographers were able to mount a successful ciphertext-only cryptanalysis of the Enigma by exploiting an insecure protocol for indicating the message settings). More advanced ciphertext-only attacks on the Enigma were mounted in Bletchley Park during World War II, by intelligently guessing plaintexts corresponding to intercepted ciphertexts.

==Modern==
Every modern cipher attempts to provide protection against ciphertext-only attacks. The vetting process for a new cipher design standard usually takes many years and includes exhaustive testing of large quantities of ciphertext for any statistical departure from random noise. &quot;See:&quot; Advanced Encryption Standard process. Also, the field of steganography evolved, in part, to develop methods like mimic functions that allow one piece of data to adopt the statistical profile of another. Nonetheless, poor cipher usage or reliance on home-grown proprietary algorithms that have not been subject to thorough scrutiny has resulted in many computer-age encryption systems that are still subject to ciphertext-only attack. Examples include:

===Examples===
*Early versions of Microsoft&#x27;s PPTP virtual private network software used the same RC4 key for the sender and the receiver (later versions had other problems). In any case where a stream cipher like RC4 is used twice with the same key, it is open to ciphertext-only attack. &quot;See:&quot; stream cipher attack
* Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), the first security protocol for Wi-Fi, proved vulnerable to several attacks, most of them ciphertext-only.
* GSM&#x27;s A5/1 and A5/2
* Some modern cipher designs have later been shown to be vulnerable to ciphertext-only attacks. For example, Akelarre.
* A cipher whose key space is too small is subject to brute force attack with access to nothing but ciphertext by simply trying all possible keys. All that is needed is some way to distinguish valid plaintext from random noise, which is easily done for natural languages when the ciphertext is longer than the unicity distance. One example is DES, which only has 56-bit keys. All too common current examples are commercial security products that derive keys for otherwise impregnable ciphers like AES from a user-selected password. Since users rarely employ passwords with anything close to the entropy of the cipher&#x27;s key space, such systems are often quite easy to break in practice using only ciphertext. The 40-bit CSS cipher used to encrypt DVD video discs can always be broken with this method, as all that is needed is to look for MPEG-2 video data.

<text>George Isaac Smith MBE (April 6, 1909 – December 19, 1982) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the 18th premier of Nova Scotia from 1967 to 1970. He was a Canadian senator from 1975 until his death. G.I. Smith is noted for having recruited Robert Stanfield to help rebuild and lead the Progressive Conservatives in Nova Scotia. While premier he brought Michelin Tire, still Nova Scotia&#x27;s biggest employer, to the province. He established the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission, and had the government take over Sydney Steel Corporation when its corporate owners quit the industry. His government also established the affordable housing community of Lower Sackville.

Earlier in his ministerial years, as highways minister (1956–62) he built the Bicentennial Highway and paved many miles of roads throughout the province. As finance and economics minister (1962–67) He was most noted for creating the Voluntary Economic Planning organization through which, business labour and community and academic leaders worked to develop economic plans for the province.

Smith also worked with Premier Stanfield and cabinet colleagues to create Industrial Estates Limited, a body designed to attract industry to Nova Scotia.

==Biography==
Born in Stewiacke, Nova Scotia on April 6, 1909 to Major John Robert Smith and Susan Ettinger Coulter. Educated at Stewiacke School and Colchester County Academy, Truro. He then attended Dalhousie University and graduated with LLB in 1932. He became Stewiacke town solicitor and Town Clerk. A few years later he joined with Tatamagouche native, and former Yarmouth federal Conservative candidate, Frank Patterson to establish a Truro Law firm Patterson Smith, where he practiced law in Truro. He served overseas in the North Nova Scotia Highlanders during World War II and was mentioned in dispatches, and ended up with rank of Lt. Colonel and was commanding officer of the regiment.

Smith was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Colchester County in 1949 and served until 1974. He joined Robert Stanfield&#x27;s cabinet when the Tories formed government in 1956. In 1967 when Stanfield left to become National PC leader, he made it clear that he would only do so if Smith would agree to succeed him as Premier of Nova Scotia.

Smith&#x27;s government was defeated by the Liberals in 1970 and Smith resigned as party leader the next year. In 1975 he was summoned to the Senate of Canada by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and represented the senatorial division of Colchester, Nova Scotia. In the Senate Smith was a vigorous advocate of equalization payments and fair treatment of all provinces.

Smith died in office in Truro, Nova Scotia on December 19, 1982.

In 1938, Smith married Law Firm Secretary Sally Archibald of Truro. Together they had three children John Robert (Rob), Ruby Alison and George Isaac. Sally Smith died on March 26, 2011, her 95th birthday. Youngest Son George died on Christmas Day 2012, age 58.

<doc id="522941" wikidata="Q1378975" url="?curid=522941" title="Convention center">
<text>A convention center (American English; or conference centre in British English) is a large building that is designed to hold a convention, where individuals and groups gather to promote and share common interests. Convention centers typically offer sufficient floor area to accommodate several thousand attendees. Very large venues, suitable for major trade shows, are sometimes known as exhibition halls. Convention centers typically have at least one auditorium and may also contain concert halls, lecture halls, meeting rooms, and conference rooms. Some large resort area hotels include a convention center.

In Francophone countries, the term is palais des congrès (such as the Palais des Congrès de Paris) or centre des congrès (such as the Centre des congrès de Quebec).

==Types==

* Meeting facilities with lodging: hotels that include their own convention space in addition to accommodation and other related facilities, known as convention hotels.
* Meeting facilities without lodging: are convention centers that do not include accommodation; usually located adjacent to or near a hotel(s).
* Other: any convention and meeting facilities designed to hold large numbers of people. Can exist alone (e.g., stadiums, arenas, parks, etc.) or within other structures (e.g., university lecture halls, museums, theaters). Usually do not include accommodation.

== History ==
The original convention centers or halls were in castles and palaces. Originally a hall in a castle would be designed to allow a large group of lords, knights and government officials to attend important meetings with the king. A more ancient tradition would have the king or lord decide disputes among his people. These administrative actions would be done in the great hall and would exhibit the wisdom of the king as judge to the general populace.

One of the most famous convention center debacles happened in France on June 20, 1789. King Louis XVI locked a group known as the Third Estate out of the meeting hall in Versailles. This led to the revolutionary group holding their meeting in an indoor tennis court. This was the first modern democratic conference center and lead to the Tennis Court Oath and the French Revolution.

<doc id="522944" wikidata="Q2688209" url="?curid=522944" title="Zerene eurydice">
<text>Zerene eurydice, the California dogface butterfly, belongs to the family Pieridae and is a sister genus to &quot;Colias.&quot; &quot;The Zerene eurydice&quot; and the &quot;Colias&quot; both share the &quot;characteristic of having yellow-orange and black wing coordination&quot;.&quot;&quot; Additionally the,&quot;&quot;Colias&quot; and &quot;Zerene eurydice&quot; males have bright UV patterns on their wings.&quot; There are only two species of the &quot;Zerene&quot;, the &quot;Zerene eurydice&quot;, and the Zerene cesonia, also known as the Southern dogface. A study that collected mitochondrial DNA from various &quot;Colias&quot; butterfly species found that &quot;Z. eurydice&quot; had decreased divergence from the ingroup, highlighting how closely related these two genera are. This species is endemic to California, and is California&#x27;s state insect. The California dogface butterfly varies in its wing color and pattern. 
== Description ==
The California dogface butterfly, gained its name as a result of the coloring of the wings of the butterfly, especially in the males. &quot;The &quot;Zerene eurydice&quot; only has UV patterns on its dorsal forewings.&quot; The female mostly has yellow wings, with two black dots or dashes on each forewing, while the male has black on the outer edges of the forewing, usually enclosing a yellow-orange color and two black dots. Male &quot;Z. Eurydice&quot; butterflies have an iridescent pigment found in their dorsal forewings due to light reflecting chitin structures and this has been associated with mating success. The wing span of &quot;Zerene Eurydice&quot; measures on average 5.1 to 6.3 cm. The wings are covered with scales to assist &quot;flight aerodynamics and heat insulation&quot; and the overall body contains &quot;setae hairs that sense vibration and touch.&quot;

==Distribution, feeding and habitat==
&quot;Z. eurydice&quot;″s distribution is limited to that of California and is commonly found in the San Bernardino mountains and Santa Ana Mountains in Southern California. The &quot;Zerene&#x27;s&quot; habitat is found in &quot;foothills, chaparral, oak or coniferous woodlands.&quot; Within these regions, the habitat is temperate and terrestrial.

Larvae of &quot;Z. eurydice&quot; exclusively feed on &quot;Amorpha californica&quot;, and &quot;Amorpha fruticosa,&quot; which belong to the family Fabaceae. These host plants are found within, &quot;poison oak, willow, and near streambanks. During the larva and pupal stages, the &quot;Zerene eurydice&quot; are greenish yellow(same colors as family &quot;Fabaceae&quot;), and depend on &quot;Amorpha californica&quot; and &quot;Amorpha fruitcosa&quot; for camouflaging from predators. These butterflies fly very fast, and are difficult to approach unless they are nectaring at flowers. As a result, it is a challenge to get a photograph of them with their wings open. This fast flight aids &quot;Z. eurydice&quot; in escaping from predators such as: &quot;ants, spiders, wasps, parasitic wasps, parasitic flies, birds, rats, toads, lizards, praying mantis, and snakes.&quot; Adult butterflies are attracted to regions with moist soils and feed on several species of flowers. It has been found that they are especially fond of blue gilia, sunflowers and thistle blooms. 
The breeding season for &quot;Zerene eurydice&quot; is between early spring and late summer, with an average of hundred eggs per season. &quot;Z. Eurydice&quot; butterflies usually begin their flights around 7 a.m. and fly until the afternoon. This is not continuous and the butterflies will often roost in bushes. The females usually depart in flight an hour or two after the males.

==First state insect==
The California dogface butterfly has been the state insect of the U.S. state of California since 1972. Its endemic range is limited to the state. California was the first state to choose a state insect—and thus, to choose a butterfly—though most of the other states have now followed, and many even have both a state insect and state butterfly. It took 43 years, a determined 4th grade class, and Fresno Assemblyman Kenneth Maddy to have the California Dogface butterfly designated as the state insect.

==Threats==
Threats towards the species &quot;Zerene eurydice&quot; include, &quot;fire suppression which results in closure of habitat openings and may result in eventual overly intense fires that could eradicate populations.&quot; &quot;Zerene eurydice&quot; are also locally threatened by livestock grazing. For global status-most recently updated in 2019-classifies &quot;Zerene eurydice&quot; as G4, indicating &quot;apparently secure.&quot; The reasons behind &quot;Zerene eurydice&quot; being &quot;apparently secure&quot; are, &quot;although this species is uncommon and local, and is a subject to some threats, they persist in a relatively large number of occurrences.&quot; The number of element occurrences for &quot;Zerene eurydice&quot; are between 81 and 300. However, the long-term trend for &quot;Zerene eurydice&quot; results in a decline of less than 30% because of &quot;the large scale of habitat conversion that has taken place in the California Coast and Transverse Ranges in the 20th century.

<doc id="522946" wikidata="Q6508756" url="?curid=522946" title="Leading edge inflatable kite">
<text>A leading edge inflatable kite (LEI) is a single skin kite with inflatable bladders providing structure. It is useful as a power or traction kite. These kites are flown using 2, 4 or 5 control lines and a bar. (See also: kite control systems) A LEI is a great kite for water use because the inflated bladders cause it to float on the water surface. A LEI can sit on the water for an indefinite time and still be relaunched because, unlike a foil kite, there are no chambers that can fill with water. Generally used for kitesurfing and kiteboarding, leading edge inflatable kites come in many different sizes, most commonly from 5 to 18 square metres.

Based on their design Leading Edge Inflatable kites can be broken down into four categories: C-kites, hybrid kites, delta kites, and bow kites.

==C-kites==
C-kites are the oldest style of LEI used for traction kiting. They typically come with four lines, and some have the option of an additional 5th line for safety and easy relaunching. The main difference between C-kites and other LEI styles is that they do not have any lines that support the leading edge of the kite (called bridles). The lines on a C-kite attach to the four corners of the kite. Hybrid kites, together with bow kites and later delta kites are all subtypes of a SLE-kite (Supported Leading Edge), defined by having a bridle which supports the leading edge. C-kites are the preferred kite of wake-style kiteboarders.

==SLE sub-types==
===Bow kites===

All of the Bow kite&#x27;s advantages are because of its concave trailing edge. This design feature changes the shape of the kite&#x27;s trailing edge as it flies, requiring that the leading edge flatten to match, resulting in a much flatter looking kite. The bridles on the kite restrict the leading edge and hold it in line with the rest of the kite. In addition, the concave trailing edge enables the kite to be sheeted out further than a traditional C- kite, which is why a Bow kite can be nearly 100% depowered.

The inflatable and bow kite designs were invented by Dominique and Bruno Legaignoux.

===Hybrid kites===
Hybrid kites are a cross between C-kites and bow kites. Like bow kites, they incorporate bridles to support their leading edge. These bridles support the kite and enable designers to experiment with different arc profiles - some Hybrids can have a very flat arc, while some can look similar to a C-kite. Individual characteristics of the Hybrid kites vary depending on how similar they represent one of the other two kite styles. The defining difference between a Hybrid and Bow kite is the shape of the trailing edge. The trailing edge on a Hybrid kite is convex, whereas that of a Bow is concave.

===Delta kites===
Delta kites are a refinement of the hybrid design. Their shape (when flattened out) is more triangular, which places more of the kite&#x27;s canopy in the middle. This increases the amount of &quot;projected area&quot; that is exposed to the wind, resulting in more power. These kites still use a bridle (though often extremely simplified), and so could still be called SLE kites. (They are often called C-shaped, but they are not C-kites as they are traditionally known.) Delta C-kites are a new breed of hybrid which combines the high-performance of a C-kite with the depowerable fast-turning triangular Delta kites.

<text>Robert Dunkerson Orr (November 17, 1917 – March 10, 2004) was an American politician and diplomat who served as the 45th governor of Indiana from 1981 to 1989. A member of the Republican Party, he served as United States Ambassador to Singapore from 1989 to 1992 under President George H. W. Bush.

==Early life==
Robert D. Orr was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where his family was vacationing, on November 17, 1917, the last of the three children of Samuel Lowery and Louise Dunkerson Orr. His father was an industrialist with interests in many companies whose holdings were centralized in the Orr Iron Company. Orr grew up in Evansville, Indiana, where his father&#x27;s company was headquartered. His family have lived in the area for three generations.

He attended local public schools for most of his early education, but transferred to the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut before his final year of high school beginning in 1934. Upon graduation he was accepted to Yale University, enrolling in 1936. At Yale, he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter). He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1940 and then enrolled in Harvard Business School.

After the outbreak of World War II, he left Harvard without graduating to join the Army. He was admitted to Officer&#x27;s Candidate School and after completing his course served on the staff of the quartermaster&#x27;s general staff in the Pacific Theater, eventually rising to the rank of major. For his service, he was awarded the Legion of Merit. He met Joanne &quot;Josie&quot; Wallace who served in the Women&#x27;s Air Force Service Pilots, while he was serving. They were married in 1944, settled in Evansville, and eventually had three children.

After returning home, Orr entered into the family business and became active in Republican politics of Vanderburgh County. Many Evansville factories had been creating war implements, and the end of the conflict led many of them to close. Orr began purchasing vacated factories, refurbishing them to produce goods, and selling them. Through his activity, he became involved in a local economic development committee. His business and holdings expanded rapidly and by 1953 he was on the board of twenty local businesses including Erie Investments, Sterling Brewers, and Grand Junction, and was director of twelve other companies. He was on several civic boards including the Rotary Club, Evansville YMCA, Willard Library, Buffalo Trace Council of Boy Scouts of America, and the Presbyterian Church of Evansville. Because of his community service, he was awarded the Jaycees Young Man of the Year award in 1953. As a result of the award, he was invited to serve as a trustee of Hanover College, a position he held for decades.

==Political career==
Orr first became involved in politics in 1950 as a member of a local Republican Party advisory board. In 1951 he became chairman of the local party; he served until 1954. He was a precinct committeeman for eight years, and in 1958 became treasurer for the Eight District Republican Committee, a position he held until 1960. In 1965 he was elected chairman of the Vanderburg County Republican Central Committee; he held that position for six years.

In 1968 he was elected to the Indiana Senate representing Evansville. He served there until 1973. In 1972, he was nominated at the State Republican Convention to run for Lieutenant Governor on a ticket with Otis R. Bowen. The election campaign focused largely on their opponents&#x27; records of raising taxes, and they won the election with 56.8 percent of the vote. As lieutenant governor, Orr oversaw the state agricultural bureau and was director of the Indiana Department of Commerce. Orr drew on his experience in economic development in Evansville to put in a place a statewide economic growth plan. He convinced state leaders to fund the creation of two Port of Indiana ports on the Ohio River, one at Mount Vernon and other at Jeffersonville, and he launched a successful tourist attraction campaign. Orr vote five tie-breaking votes in the Indiana Senate during his term, including one that passed Bowen&#x27;s tax reorganization plan, drastically lowering property taxes, requiring local taxing authorities to receive state-level approval to raise taxes, while increasing the state sales tax. Orr and Bowen were re-elected to office in 1976.

Orr was popular statewide because of his economic plans and for being associated with the tax reorganization plan. With Bowen&#x27;s backing, he ran unopposed for the Republican nomination to run for governor in 1980. In the general election, he was opposed by Democrat John Hillenbrand. Orr focused on connecting himself with the popular Governor Bowen; his slogan was &quot;Let&#x27;s Keep a Good Thing Going.&quot; He easily defeated Hillenbrand, 1,257,383 (57.7 percent) to 913,116 (41.9 percent) votes.

As governor, he oversaw the reform of the Indiana educational system. In 1984, he defeated State Senator Wayne Townsend of Hartford City to win a second term as governor: 1,146,497 (52.8 percent of the two-party vote) to 1,036,832 (47.2 percent). An ad from the 1984 campaign, which featured an actress playing a fortune teller and a singer with a Daryl Hall style mullet, was featured on an episode of CNN&#x27;s Not Just Another Cable News Show. In the 1984 election, Orr polled 110,886 fewer votes than he had in 1980, and his overall percent dropped by 4.9.

In 1986, Orr served as president of the Council of State Governments and as the chairman of the Midwestern Governors Association.

After his terms as governor, Orr was named by U.S. President George H. W. Bush as the U.S. Ambassador to Singapore, a position that he held until 1992.

After he left his ambassadorship, Orr established a consulting firm called the Alliance for Global Commerce, which focused on international trade and export issues.

In 2000, he and his wife, Joanne &quot;Josie&quot; Wallace, divorced. In 2001, at the age of eighty-three, he married Mary Kay Davis. On March 10, 2004, Orr died at the age of eighty-six at the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis from complications following kidney surgery. He is buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.

The portion of Interstate 69 south of its interchange with Interstate 64, at one time labeled Interstate 164, is named the &quot;Robert D. Orr Highway&quot; in his honor.

<text>Mei Yaochen () (1002–1060) was a Chinese poet of the Song dynasty. He was one of the pioneers of the &quot;new subjective&quot; style of poetry which characterized Song poetry.

Mei Yaochen was born in Xuancheng in present-day Anhui Province. His style name was &#x27;Sheng Yu&#x27; (). He passed the jinshi exam in 1051 and had a career in the civil service, but was unsuccessful. He was a prolific poet, with around 3000 works extant; he was popularized as a poet by the younger Ouyang Xiu.

Most of his works are in the &quot;shi&quot; form, but they are much freer in content than those of the Tang dynasty. His response to the impossibility of surpassing the Tang poets was to make a virtue of his lack of ambition; his ideal was 平淡 (pingdan), or the pedestrian. His early verses are often socio-critical, advocating reform along Neo-Confucian lines; later he turned to celebrations of ordinary life and verses mourning the deaths of his first wife and several of his children.
An example is his poem translated into English by Kenneth Rexroth as &quot;An Excuse for Not Returning the Visit of a Friend.&quot;

<text>Paul Oscar Adolph Husting (April 25, 1866October 21, 1917) was an American lawyer and Democratic politician from Mayville, Wisconsin. He was the first popularly-elected United States senator from Wisconsin, serving from 1915 until his death in 1917. He previously served eight years in the Wisconsin Senate, representing Dodge County, and was district attorney for four years. He was a grandson of Solomon Juneau, the founder of Milwaukee.

== Background and early career ==
Husting was born April 25, 1866, in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Husting moved with his parents to Mayville, Wisconsin, in 1876, where he received a common school education. From the age of 17 years, he became successively a retail clerk in a general store, a railway postal clerk, a mailing clerk in the Wisconsin State Prison at Waupun, and assistant bookkeeper in the office of the Secretary of State of Wisconsin under Thomas J. Cunningham.

Husting entered the University of Wisconsin Law School, passed the state bar examination, and was admitted to the bar in 1895. He initially practiced law in Mayville by himself, but in 1897 associated himself with C. W. Lamoreux until the latter was elected judge, upon which the firm of Husting &amp; Brother was formed.

== Public office ==
Husting was elected district attorney of Dodge County in 1902 and reelected in 1904. He was elected to the state senate in 1906, and reelected in 1910. In the state senate, he advocated conservation of the state&#x27;s natural resources, the income tax, the &quot;Husting bill&quot; establishing a maximum passenger railroad fare of two cents per mile, initiative and referendum, and direct election of United States senators. He offered the original resolution to investigate, and assisted in the investigation of, the Wisconsin primary and election of 1908, which resulted in the enactment of the state&#x27;s Corrupt Practices Act.

Husting was the first United States senator from Wisconsin to be elected by a direct vote of the people, defeating the incumbent Governor, Francis E. McGovern, at the November 1914 election by 967 votes. He succeeded Isaac Stephenson as the United States senator on March 4, 1915, and served in the Senate from 1915 until his death. During his time in the U.S. Senate, he was chairman of the Committee on Fisheries during 1917 and chairman of a special committee investigating trespasses on Indian lands during his entire time in the Senate.

Husting was the only Democrat to win a state-wide election in Wisconsin between 1892 and 1932.

== Death and political consequences ==

Husting was killed in a duck hunting accident on Rush Lake near Pickett, Wisconsin. While rising in a row boat after telling his brother Gustav to fire, Gustav accidentally shot his brother in the back. Husting fell into a coma, and died later that same day. The &quot;New York Times&quot; described him as &quot;the most aggressive leader&quot; of the &quot;loyalist&quot; (e.g. supportive of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s pro-Allied policies) forces in Wisconsin, and contrasted him with &quot;Senator La Follette and the pro-German constituency behind him&quot;. He is interred on the Husting family plot at Graceland Cemetery in Mayville.

Husting&#x27;s death was of political importance. In 1919 the Senate would have been under Democratic control had he not been succeeded by Republican Irvine Lenroot, as a consequence of which in 1919 the Senate had 49 Republicans and 47 Democrats (Vice-President Thomas R. Marshall was a Democrat, and had the power to break all ties).

==Personal life and family==
Paul Husting was the second of seven children born to John P. and Mary M. (&quot;&quot; Juneau) Husting. John P. Husting had emigrated to Wisconsin from the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg in 1855. Mary M. Juneau was the twelfth of sixteen children born to Solomon Juneau—the co-founder and first mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Husting&#x27;s younger brother, Berthold Juneau &quot;Bert&quot; Husting, had a brief career in professional baseball and was later United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin in the 1940s.

His older brother, Charles Ottomar &quot;Otto&quot; Husting, served as Paul&#x27;s private secretary in the U.S. Senate.

<doc id="522958" wikidata="Q622381" url="?curid=522958" title="Deterministic system">
<text>In mathematics, computer science and physics, a deterministic system is a system in which no randomness is involved in the development of future states of the system. A deterministic model will thus always produce the same output from a given starting condition or initial state.

==In physics==

Physical laws that are described by differential equations represent deterministic systems, even though the state of the system at a given point in time may be difficult to describe explicitly.

In quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation, which describes the continuous time evolution of a system&#x27;s wave function, is deterministic. However, the relationship between a system&#x27;s wave function and the observable properties of the system appears to be non-deterministic.

==In mathematics==
The systems studied in chaos theory are deterministic. If the initial state were known exactly, then the future state of such a system could theoretically be predicted. However, in practice, knowledge about the future state is limited by the precision with which the initial state can be measured, and chaotic systems are characterized by a strong dependence on the initial conditions. This sensitivity to initial conditions can be measured with Lyapunov exponents.

Markov chains and other random walks are not deterministic systems, because their development depends on random choices.

==In computer science==

A deterministic model of computation, for example a deterministic Turing machine, is a model of computation such that the successive states of the machine and the operations to be performed are completely determined by the preceding state.

A deterministic algorithm is an algorithm which, given a particular input, will always produce the same output, with the underlying machine always passing through the same sequence of states. There may be non-deterministic algorithms that run on a deterministic machine, for example, an algorithm that relies on random choices. Generally, for such random choices, one uses a pseudorandom number generator, but one may also use some external physical process, such as the last digits of the time given by the computer clock.

A &quot;pseudorandom number generator&quot; is a deterministic algorithm, that is designed to produce sequences of numbers that behave as random sequences. A hardware random number generator, however, may be non-deterministic.

==Others==
In economics, the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model is deterministic. The stochastic equivalent is known as real business-cycle theory.

As determinism relates to modeling in the natural sciences, a deterministic model uses existing data to model the future behavior of a system. The deterministic model is useful for systems that do not experience frequent or unexpected behavior - unless that behavior is already present in the system via existing data. This type of modeling is distinct from stochastic modeling or forward modeling. Stochastic modeling uses random data in the model while forward modeling uses a given model to predict future behavior in a system. Deterministic models are used across the natural sciences, including geology, oceanography, physics, and other disciplines.

<text>The south-west corner drainage region of Western Australia is one of only two temperate and relatively fertile parts of mainland Australia. It covers about , or a little less than 2% of the continent. For comparison, this is about the same size as North Carolina or a little larger than England.

The landscape is generally flat and sandy but there are several major features, in particular the Stirling Range near Albany, which reaches at its highest point, and the Darling Scarp.

The climate is temperate Mediterranean. Summers are warm to hot and dry, winters are cool and wet. Mountains near the coast concentrate rainfall in that area, with parts of the extreme south-western corner receiving as much as per year. Away from the coast, however, precipitation drops rapidly, with inland areas averaging about per year.

Other Western Australian drainage divisions include:
* Pilbara freshwater ecoregion
* Timor Sea drainage division in the Kimberley and the Northern Territory Top End.

Other Australian drainage divisions include:
* Gulf of Carpentaria
* Australian north-east coast drainage division
* Australian south-east coast drainage division
* Murray-Darling Basin
* South Australian gulf drainage division
* Lake Eyre Basin
* Western Plateau

<text>Fuse is the only studio album by the rock band Fuse. It was recorded in 1969 and released in January 1970, before they broke up and with members going on to form Cheap Trick and Silver Fox.

==Production and release==
Fuse was born in Rockford, in late 1968. A single was released on Ken Adamany&#x27;s Smack Records label with the tunes &quot;Hound Dog&quot; and &quot;Crusin for Burgers.&quot; In 1969 an album was recorded with producer Jackie Mills, and released in January 1970. The titles of the single appear on the CD &quot;Re-issue&quot; by Rewind.

==Critical reception==
The album was not as successful as the band or label hoped. According to Richie Unterberger of Allmusic, &quot;The album is an average, perhaps somewhat below average, late-&#x27;60s hard rock recording. It looks forward to some facets of &#x27;70s metal and art rock in its overwrought vocals, tandem hard rock guitar riffs, and classical-influenced keyboards.&quot;

Rick Nielsen has nothing good to say about the &quot;Fuse&quot; album, stating &quot;Tom Petersson and I were in a Midwest band called Fuse. The guys we were with were all rinky dinks; they’re probably pumping gas now. Tom and I had the stick-to-it-iveness and positive thinking to know what we wanted to do, so we split the band and went off to hang out in England... That Fuse stuff stinks. We don’t stand by it.&quot; By Petersson&#x27;s account, &quot;The band was much better than the album indicates. When it came out we were disgusted. The producer was an idiot.&quot;

The other band members were not rinky dinks, far from it. Guitarist Craig Myers was a guitar prodigy, playing in bands since he was 12 or 13 years old. Drummer Chip Greenman was also universally respected amongst his peers, as was singer Joe Sundberg. In fact Craig, Chip and Tom Peterson were bandmates in Toastin Jam, the band Rick Nielsen essentially joined when he broke up the version of The Grim Reapers that was a cover band in order to pursue creating original music with the talented musicians in Toastin Jam.

Jackie Mills produced quality psychedelic rock records with Kaleidoscope and The Floating Bridge before working with Fuse. Fuse had been together for less than a year when they recorded the album, so presumably the material was written in that short period of time, and the band members were novice songwriters.

<doc id="522968" wikidata="Q466289" url="?curid=522968" title="Dry deck shelter">
<text>A dry deck shelter (DDS) is a removable module that can be attached to a submarine to allow divers easy exit and entrance while the boat is submerged. The host submarine must be specially modified to accommodate the DDS, with the appropriate mating hatch configuration, electrical connections, and piping for ventilation, divers&#x27; air, and draining water. The DDS can be used to deploy a SEAL Delivery Vehicle submersible, Navy divers, or Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC).

==Active and future DDS-capable submarines ==
===Royal Navy===
In UK service it is formally named the Special Forces Payload Bay (SFPB) and was procured under ‘Project Chalfont’.
 Training is conducted at the purpose-built Chalfont Shore Facility (CSF) constructed by BAE Systems at HMNB Clyde. It is used by the .

===United States Navy===
The United States Navy&#x27;s DDSs are long and high and wide, add about 30 tons to its host submarine&#x27;s submerged displacement, can be transported by trucks or C-5 Galaxy airplanes, and require one to three days to install and test. They have three HY-80 steel sections within the outer glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) fairing: a spherical hyperbaric chamber at the forward end to treat injured divers; a smaller spherical transfer trunk; and a cylindrical hangar with elliptical ends. The hangar can support a SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) submersible, six Navy SEALs to man the SDV, and a crew of Navy Divers to operate the DDS and launch the SDV; or 20 SEALs with four Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC). The SDV release team consists of 2 officers, 2 enlisted technicians, and 18 divers.
The two SEAL delivery vehicle teams report to Naval Special Warfare Group 3.

There are currently six portable dry deck shelters in use by the USN, the first one built by Electric Boat. The first, designated DDS-01S (&quot;S&quot; for starboard opening outer door), was completed in 1982. The remaining five, DDS-02P (&quot;P&quot; for port opening), -03P, -04S, -05S, and -06P, were built between 1987 and 1991 and were built by Newport News Shipbuilding. The shelters are maintained by a combined effort of Navy divers stationed on the teams and workers of the maintenance company Oceaneering International. They have expected useful lives of about 40 years each.

The first submarine to have an operational dry deck shelter was the , which was fitted with the DDS in 1982 and first deployed with it in 1983. It is deployed on the , the , the :, and the
. The &quot;Ohio&quot;-class SSGNs are capable of supporting dual dry deck shelters.

=== French Navy &quot;(Marine nationale)&quot; ===

&quot;Suffren&quot;-class submarine, a nuclear attack submarines designed by the French shipbuilder Naval Group, integrate a removable dry deck shelter. It can deploy a dozen combat swimmers and embark the new PSM3G swimmer delivery vehicle (SDV). 

==Former DDS-capable submarines==

<text>The Five College Radio Astronomical Observatory (FCRAO) was a radio astronomy observatory located on a peninsula in the Quabbin Reservoir. It was sited in the town of New Salem, Massachusetts on land that was originally part of Prescott, Massachusetts. It was founded in 1969 by the Five College Astronomy Department (University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass), Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College and Smith College). From its inception, the observatory has emphasized research, the development of technology and the training of students—both graduate and undergraduate.

The initial FCRAO telescope was a customized low-frequency antenna to search for pulsars in the galaxy. The development of instrumentation within the FCRAO labs contributed to the discovery of the binary pulsar system PSR B1913+16 by Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse, for which they received the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics. It was replaced by a 14-meter radome-enclosed millimeter-wave telescope in 1976.

== Decommissioning ==

After UMass Amherst devoted its time, energy, and funding to the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) in Mexico from approximately 2005, FCRAO was described as being the then–&quot;current platform&quot;, with the LMT referred to as its &quot;future platform&quot;. On July 21, 2011, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority announced that the telescope and the associated control building were removed from the site.

<doc id="522976" wikidata="Q722712" url="?curid=522976" title="Jean Baptiste Boisduval">
<text>Jean Baptiste Alphonse Déchauffour de Boisduval (24 June 1799 – 30 December 1879) was a French lepidopterist, botanist, and physician.

He was one of the most celebrated lepidopterists of France, and was the co-founder of the Société entomologique de France. While best known abroad for his work in entomology, he started his career in botany, collecting a great number of French plant specimens and writing broadly on the topic throughout his career, including the textbook &quot;Flores française&quot; in 1828. Early in his career, he was interested in Coleoptera and allied himself with both Jean Théodore Lacordaire and Pierre André Latreille. He was the curator of the Pierre Françoise Marie Auguste Dejean collection in Paris and described many species of beetles, as well as butterflies and moths, resulting from the voyages of the &quot;Astrolabe&quot;, the expedition ship of Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse and the &quot;Coquille&quot;, that of Louis Isidore Duperrey.

He left Paris, where he had lived for nearly 60 years, in 1875, to retire in Ticheville near his family. His brother was Adolphe-Armand d&#x27;Echauffour de Boisduval (September 26, 1801 – March 1, 1842), a doctor, naturalist, and health officer in their native Ticheville.

Boisduval&#x27;s Elateridae are in the Natural History Museum, London and the types of Curculionidae in Brussels Natural History Museum. His Lepidoptera were sold to Charles Oberthür. The Sphingidae are in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

 The standard author abbreviation is Boisduval when citing a zoological name.

<text>Sydney Tower, also known as Westfield Tower and formerly as Centrepoint Tower, is an observation and telecommunications tower that is the tallest structure in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, as well as the second-tallest observation tower in the Southern Hemisphere. Sydney Tower has also previously been known as &quot;AMP Tower&quot;.

The tower stands above the Sydney central business district (CBD), located on Market Street, between Pitt and Castlereagh Streets. It is accessible from the Pitt Street Mall, Market Street or Castlereagh Street and sits above the Westfield Sydney (formerly Centrepoint) shopping centre. The tower is open to the public, and is one of the most prominent tourist attractions in the city, being visible from a number of vantage points throughout town and from adjoining suburbs. Auckland&#x27;s Sky Tower is taller but Sydney Tower&#x27;s main observation deck is almost higher than the observation deck on Auckland&#x27;s Sky Tower.

While the shopping centre at the base of the tower is run by the Scentre Group, the tower itself is occupied by Trippas White Group, which owns and operates Sydney Tower Dining, and Merlin Entertainments, which owns and operates the Sydney Tower Eye observation deck and outside adventure experience known as the SKYWALK.

==History==
Designed by Australian architect Donald Crone, the first plans for Sydney Tower were unveiled in March 1968. Construction of the office building started in 1970, and tower construction began in 1975. Prior to construction of the tower, the height limit in Sydney had been set at , to allow for the harbour&#x27;s flying boats that were popular before the jet era. It was developed by AMP, with Concrete Constructions the main contractor.

Public access to the tower began in September 1981. The total cost of construction was A$36
million. In 1998, the addition of a lightning rod to the top of spire extended the tower&#x27;s overall height from 305 metres to , which is above sea level.

While AMP managed the Centrepoint shopping centre, the tower was officially referred to as the AMP Tower. After the Westfield Group took over ownership of Centrepoint in December 2001, the name was changed to Sydney Tower.

In 2009, the base building was closed and stripped for a major refurbishment. This involved the connection of the shopping centre to other arcades and a complete upgrade of all the sites. The shopping centre was progressively reopened from 2010 and was renamed Westfield Sydney. In June 2011 the AMP banner was removed by helicopter from the tower and replaced by a large illuminated Westfield logo.

In 2011, Merlin Entertainments acquired the rights to operate the observation deck, renaming the attraction the Sydney Tower Eye.

==Structure==
===Sections===
Four sections of the tower are open to the public, three being occupied by Sydney Tower Dining. 360 Bar and Dining, which offers revolving views of the Sydney skyline, is located on level one of the Sydney Tower. Sydney Tower Buffet, a contemporary self-select restaurant, is on the tower&#x27;s second level. Studio, located on level three can cater for cocktail functions for 200 people and 156 sit-down guests.

The observation deck, currently called the Sydney Tower Eye, is located on level four of Sydney Tower. To access this level, visitors can buy a pass from the operating company or at the gate. The pass allows access to other Sydney attractions including Wild Life Sydney and the Sydney Aquarium. The Sydney Tower Eye is located above ground level. It has a fully enclosed viewing platform featuring 360-degree views of the city and surrounding areas. This floor also houses a small gift shop, multilingual touchscreens and a readout that displays data about the wind speed, direction, sway amplitude, and other statistics of the tower. On 23 September 2011, a 4D cinema was opened on the fourth floor of the arcade, playing a film with footage from various locations in Sydney. The theatre is the first of its kind in Australia; in-theatre effects include wind, bubbles, and fire.

Skywalk is an open-air glass-floored platform encircling the Sydney Tower Eye at a height of above ground level. The viewing platform extends over the edge of the main structure of the deck. It was opened on 18 October 2005, cost A$3.75 million to construct, took four years to design and two months to build. This platform is only accessible as part of planned and booked tours.

===Details===
The golden turret near the top of the tower has a maximum capacity of 960 people. Travel to the observation deck is by three high speed double-deck lifts, each with a capacity of 8 to 10 people. The lifts travel at full, half or quarter speed, depending on wind conditions. At full speed the lifts reach the deck in 45 seconds.

==Cultural events==
Leading up to the Sydney 2000 Olympics, the tower was decorated with sculptures by Australian artist Dominique Sutton (an athlete rising from starting blocks, a gymnast performing a handstand, and a wheelchair basketball player passing the ball) which were positioned above the main body of the tower and in some cases overhung the edges. These sculptures were removed in 2002 and relocated to Sydney Olympic Park at Homebush Bay. The figures were placed atop the tower using an S-64 Aircrane heavy lift helicopter known as &quot;Elvis&quot;.

On several occasions, the tower has been used to launch fireworks or it has been illuminated with coloured lights as part of various celebrations in Sydney, such as New Year&#x27;s Eve or during the Olympics in 2000.

Each year the Sydney Tower Stair Challenge comprises the challenge of running up 1,504 stairs from Pitt Street Mall to the Observation Deck. The event is to raise money for the Cancer Council, and the two winners become eligible to compete in the Empire State Building Run-up. However, the event was cancelled in both 2011 and 2012.

==Incidents==
On 8 March 2018, the Skywalk was closed for five weeks following the suicide of a 21-year-old woman who removed her safety harness and leapt from the tower while on a tour. The Skywalk reopened on 12 April 2018, after conducting a probe into the incident and the tower having upgraded the safety equipment.

The second suicide took place on 8 July that same year. Leonard Nherera, 18, jumped 268 metres to his death from the Skywalk tour at 7pm.

== Engineering heritage award ==
The tower received an Engineering Heritage Plaque from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

==In popular culture==
*The tower appeared in the 1990 Disney animated film &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; and the 2003 Disney/Pixar animated film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;.
*In the film &quot;&quot;, the tower is seen in several shots, usually shown whenever the CBD of Sydney appears.
*The tower was featured in the 1995 film &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;, where it was used as the Angel Grove Observatory. A CGI simulation of the tower was used when it became a weapon for the main villain, Ivan Ooze in the film&#x27;s climactic battle.
* The tower is destroyed in the films &quot;&quot; and &quot;Supernova&quot;.
*The tower is demolished in the 2017 short film&quot; Waltzing Tilda&quot;.

<doc id="522983" wikidata="Q2476709" url="?curid=522983" title="Red Shoe Diaries">
<text>Red Shoe Diaries is an American erotic drama anthology series that aired on Showtime from 1992 to 1997, and was distributed by Playboy Entertainment overseas. It is a spin-off of the television film of the same name directed by Zalman King. Most episodes were directed by either King or Rafael Eisenman.

The storylines usually have a plot revolving around romantic intrigue and the sexual awakening of a woman who often also narrates. Sensuous love scenes with nudity as well as sultry, moody music are characteristic for most episodes. There is no story arc or characters connecting the different stories other than Jake Winters introducing each episode.

==Premise==
Jake Winters (David Duchovny) places an ad in the newspaper under &quot;Red Shoes&quot;, seeking women to mail in their personal diaries with stories of love, passion and/or betrayal. He is then shown walking on desolate train tracks with his dog Stella. He begins reading a letter from his post office box out loud that begins with &quot;Dear Red Shoes...&quot; In the pilot film, Jake lost his fiancée to suicide and discovered she kept a diary detailing an affair she had with a construction worker and shoe salesman who sold her a pair of red high heels. He placed the ad in the newspaper in an effort to make sense of his fiancée&#x27;s secret life through the stories of women in similar situations. Each episode is devoted to a woman&#x27;s story Jake receives, and begins and ends with Jake&#x27;s comments to Stella.

==Production==
Zalman King conceived of an erotic television series that would air on premium cable, which was then a burgeoning market as it was not beholden to MPAA ratings. With his wife and collaborator Patricia Louisianna Knop, King wrote the script for the television film &quot;Red Shoe Diaries&quot;, intending it to be the pilot for the anthology series. The film, in conjunction with four episodes, was pitched to Showtime in 1991.

Said King: &quot;I wanted to do an anthology series from a very intimate, woman&#x27;s point of view.&quot; He dismissed the term softcore to categorize his work because of its pornographic connotations, saying, &quot;Eroticism has a real place in my vocabulary because [it] usually needs to move out of a relationship or some sort of tension and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m very interested in. I usually think of my work as romance.&quot; Producer David Saunders said, &quot;We weren&#x27;t interested in making porn. We wanted to make erotic movies with good stories that looked great, were well-acted, and that concerned women as well as men. Showtime&#x27;s interests and our interests coincided.&quot; Of the show&#x27;s content, writer Chloe King said, &quot;It&#x27;s not . There&#x27;s more intellectual than physical foreplay.&quot; Lizzie Borden, Anne Goursaud, Mary Lambert, Nelly Alard, and Elise D&#x27;Haene were among the female writers and directors on the show.

David Duchovny was cast in &quot;The X-Files&quot; shortly after signing on to do the pilot film. Though his character&#x27;s story is continued in the episode entitled &quot;Jake&#x27;s Story&quot;, he mostly appears as the series&#x27; narrator, bookending each episode.

Episodes were mostly filmed in Canoga Park in the San Fernando Valley. Later locations included Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico.

Originally screened in the UK on Channel 5 in the 1990s, the channel screened several episodes back-to-back on August 30, 2021. &quot;Red Shoe Diaries&quot; episodes were also broadcast on the Canadian television channel Showcase in August 2010.

==Reception==
Though the series did not gain positive attention from critics, it was a major success for Showtime and helped boost the network&#x27;s viewership to compete with HBO in the 1990s. It was the first softcore program to be touted by a premium cable network and to deliver consistently high ratings. Imitators and softcore series similarly aimed at female audiences sprang up in the wake of the show&#x27;s popularity, including &quot;The Hunger&quot;, &quot;Emmanuelle in Space&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Strangers&quot;. TV critics described the series as &quot;both creator of &#x27;art house&#x27; soft porn and savior of the kind of quality programming for which pay cable has also become known&quot;, and &quot;innovative for its time...[for staying] true to its basic, lusty principles while adding music-video artiness, jumpy, nervy video cuts and dim mood lighting for a veneer of upscale, almost snooty, erotica. Lifetime with nudity.&quot;

Despite the series&#x27; foregrounding of a woman&#x27;s perspective and inclusion of some lesbian story lines, it did receive criticism for its heavy featuring of female nudity, particularly since no male full frontal nudity was shown.

==Home media==
After the 1992 release of the pilot movie, episodes from the series were compiled on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD as branded &quot;Red Shoe Diaries&quot; movies. Each compilation features three episodes.

<text>In some strains of Christian theology, the Christian Church may be divided into:
*the Church Militant (), also called the Church Pilgrim, which consists of Christians on Earth who struggle as soldiers of Christ against sin, the devil, and &quot;the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places&quot;; 
*the Church Penitent (), also called the Church Suffering () or the Church Expectant (), which in the theology of certain churches, especially that of the Catholic Church, consists of those Christians currently in Purgatory; and
*the Church Triumphant (), which consists of those who have the beatific vision and are in Heaven.

Within Catholic ecclesiology these divisions are known as the &quot;three states of the Church.&quot; The actual language used in the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; states that &quot;&quot;The three states of the Church…&quot; at the present time some of his disciples are pilgrims on earth. Others have died and are being purified, while still others are in glory, contemplating &#x27;in full light, God himself triune and one, exactly as he is&#x27;.&quot;

In Protestant theology, which rejects the doctrine of Purgatory, the Churches Militant and Triumphant are together known as the two states of the Church. These divisions are often discussed in the context of the doctrine of the communion of saints; although Christians may be physically separated from each other by the barrier of death, they nonetheless remain united to each other in one Church, and support each other in prayer.

== Etymology ==
=== Militant ===
The term &quot;militant&quot; () has a primary meaning of &quot;being a soldier, performing military service&quot;, but it acquired a secondary meaning of &quot;serving, performing service, laboring&quot;, with its root &quot;&quot; coming to mean &quot;soldier of Christ or God&quot; in Medieval Latin usage. The members of the Church Militant, i.e. those Christians on earth, are engaged in spiritual warfare against sin Failing that directly, those who believe in the existence of Purgatory hope to die in a state of grace and join the Church Penitent, to purify themselves of their imperfections and, ultimately, join the Church Triumphant.

=== Penitent ===
The term &quot;penitent&quot; ( or &quot;paenitens&quot;) means &quot;repenting, being sorry&quot;. Those who constitute the Church Penitent are in Purgatory to satisfy whatever portion of the temporal punishment due for their sins was not satisfied before death. They are in a process of purging their imperfections before entering heaven. It is held that all members of the Church Penitent will eventually join the Church Triumphant.

The alternate term &quot;suffering&quot; () emphasizes the nature of souls&#x27; experience in Purgatory; they are suffering the temporal consequences of their sins to redemptive effect. The other alternative, &quot;expectant&quot; ( or &quot;exspectans&quot;), emphasizes that the souls of Purgatory are awaiting expectantly the beatific vision of heaven.

=== Triumphant ===
The term &quot;triumphant&quot; () means &quot;exulting, rejoicing exceedingly&quot;, taken from a figurative usage of &quot;&quot;, originally designating the Roman triumph. Those who constitute the Church Triumphant rejoice eternally in the glory of God, to whom they are united in the beatific vision.

== Usage in different Christian Churches ==

=== Catholic Church ===

The Catholic Church commemorates the Church Triumphant and the Church Penitent in its liturgy on two consecutive days: All Saints&#x27; Day on November 1 (the Church Triumphant) and All Souls&#x27; Day on November 2 (the Church Penitent).

These terms are not used in the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, an authoritative summary of the teaching of the Catholic Church published in 1994. However, the teaching these terms represent is precisely restated, quoting &quot;Lumen gentium&quot;: &quot;The three states of the Church&quot;. &quot;When the Lord comes in glory, and all his angels with him, death will be no more and all things will be subject to him. But at the present time some of his disciples are pilgrims on earth. Others have died and are being purified, while still others are in glory, contemplating &#x27;in full light, God himself triune and one, exactly as he is&#x27;.&quot;

=== Anglican Communion ===
Anglicans believe that &quot;…the Church on earth is united with the Church in heaven, (&#x27;sanctorum communio&#x27;). They speak of the &#x27;Church Militant here on earth&#x27; and the Church triumphant in heaven. They worship God together with &#x27;angels and archangels, and with all the company of heaven.

=== Lutheran Church ===
Eric Lund, a Lutheran professor, described an analogy relating the Old Testament to the New Testament: &quot;God ordered two altars to be placed in the tabernacle. Fire was transferred from the outer one to the inner one. God also assembled a twofold church: the church militant and the church triumphant. The fire of love will someday be transferred from the church militant to the church triumphant.&quot; As such, within Lutheranism, &quot;That is called the Church &quot;militant&quot;, which in this life is still fighting, under the banner of Christ, against Satan, the world, and the flesh.&quot; 

Likewise, &quot;That is called the Church &quot;triumphant&quot;, which, being transferred to heavenly rest, and relieved from the labor of fighting, and the danger of being overcome in heaven against all contending powers.&quot; Heinrich Schmid, a Lutheran theologian explains that the Church Militant derives her name from spiritual warfare, citing , , , , and ; he further states that the Church Triumphant derives her name from spiritual victory, citing , , and .

=== Methodist Churches ===
The African Methodist Episcopal Church, a part of the World Methodist Council, defines the Church Militant as &quot;engaged in constant warfare against the world, the flesh and the devil, and in that respect is distinguished from the Church Triumphant.&quot; It defines the Church Militant as inclusive of all Christian denominations, among them Methodism, Presbyterianism, Baptist churches, Congregational churches, Anglicanism, among many others. In the same fashion, it defines the Church Triumphant as existing &quot;in heaven, and consist[ing] of those who have washed their robes and made them immaculate and pure in the blood of the Lamb.&quot;

In Methodist theology, &quot;the communion expressed at the Eucharist is not only within the Church Militant, but is between the Church Militant and the Church Triumphant.&quot;

=== Seventh-day Adventist Church ===
The Seventh-day Adventist Church defines the terms in the following ways, &quot;While in this world the church is a militant church, daily engaged in the battles of its Lord, and in warfare against satanic agencies. Its members are in constant conflict with the world, the flesh, and the powers of evil (Rom. 7:15–23; Gal. 5:17; 1 Peter 5:8, 9; 1 John 5:4; cf. 1 John 4:4). If this side of the Lord&#x27;s return the church is the militant church, the church of the New Jerusalem is the triumphant church. It is made up of faithful disciples and conquerors in this worldly battle. They have exchanged the sword for a palm of victory (Rev 7:9) and the cross for a crown (2 Tim. 4:8; 1 Peter 5:4). The battle is over, the mission accomplished (Matt. 25:21, 23) and the redeemed, invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb (Rev. 19:9), eat and drink at Christ&#x27;s table in His kingdom (Luke 22:28–30) and reign with Him for ever and ever (Rev 22:5).&quot; Thus, the Seventh-day Adventist view is that the church is the Church Militant until the general resurrection at the end of the present age. The church becomes the Church Triumphant only after the second coming of Christ.

==Secular uses==
The two states account of the church was adapted by Anatoly Lunacharsky to distinguish between a socialistic culture of the future (&quot;Ecclesia triumphans&quot;) and proletarian culture of the proletariat struggling in the present against capitalism (&quot;Ecclesia militans&quot;). This theoretical approach was used in the development of Proletkult.

<doc id="523002" wikidata="Q739084" url="?curid=523002" title="U.S. Bancorp">
<text>U.S. Bancorp (stylized as us bancorp) is an American multinational financial services firm headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota and incorporated in Delaware. It is the 5th-largest bank in the United States as of 2025. As the largest bank in the Midwestern United States, it is considered systemically important by the Financial Stability Board. It is the parent company of its primary operating entity, U.S. Bank National Association, which does business as U.S. Bank. The company provides banking, investment, mortgage, trust, and payment services products to individuals, businesses, governmental entities, and other financial institutions. 

The firm&#x27;s early history can be traced to 1891, operating under the second-oldest banking charter granted in 1863 following the passage of the National Bank Act. Since inception dozens of regional mergers and acquisitions throughout the Upper Midwest and Western United States led to the creation of modern U.S. Bancorp. As a diversified holding company, U.S. Bancorp has acquired multiple subsidiaries since the late 2010s. Its retail credit card offerings are provided via the Visa network in the U.S. and abroad. 

U.S. Bancorp&#x27;s annual revenue levels have it ranked on the Fortune 500, with its public stock trading within both the S&amp;P 500 and S&amp;P 100 indexes. It was included in the 2024 Forbes Global 2000 for its sales, profitability, asset base, and market value, among other financial institutions. U.S. Bancorp sponsors a variety of cultural events, transportation hubs, and sporting venues, including U.S. Bank Stadium. U.S. Bank is one of the largest asset custodians in the country with $6.7 trillion under administration, including, as of 2021, digital assets. 

== History ==




The U.S. Bank name first appeared as United States National Bank of Portland, established in Portland, Oregon, in 1891. In 1902, it merged with Ainsworth National Bank of Portland, but kept the U.S. National Bank name. It changed its name to the United States National Bank of Oregon in 1964.

The central part of the franchise dates from 1864, with the formation of First National Bank of Minneapolis. In 1929, that bank merged with First National Bank of St. Paul (also formed in 1864) and several smaller Upper Midwest banks to form the First Bank Stock Corporation, which changed its name to First Bank System in 1968.

In the eastern part of the franchise, Farmers and Millers Bank in Milwaukee opened its doors in 1853, growing into the First National Bank of Milwaukee and eventually becoming First Wisconsin and ultimately Firstar Corporation. In Cincinnati, First National Bank of Cincinnati opened for business on July 13, 1863 under National Charter #24—the charter that U.S. Bancorp still operates under today, and one of the oldest active national bank charters in the nation. U.S. Bancorp claims 1863 as its founding date. Despite having started up in the midst of the Civil War, First National Bank of Cincinnati went on to survive many decades to grow into Star Bank.

===U.S. Bancorp of Oregon era===
In January 1969, the U.S. National Bank of Oregon reorganized as a holding company, U.S. Bancorp, after receiving authorization from its bank directors on September 9, 1968 and subsequently receiving legal approval to proceed from the Comptroller of the Currency on November 28, 1968. LeRoy B. Staver, president, and chief executive officer of the bank, was appointed chairman and chief executive officer for the new holding company while Robert B. Wilson was appointed president of the holding company and also executive vice president for the bank. Wilson later resigned as president in December 1972 and his position was filled eight months later by John A. Elorriaga.

Staver retired in October 1974 and was succeeded by John Elorriaga who was promoted to chairman and chief executive officer while Carl W. Mays Jr was named president in Elorriaga&#x27;s place.

A major change in the organization of leadership in the U.S. Bancorp of Oregon occurred in August 1983. Although Elorriaga remained as chairman and chief executive officer for the firm, Mays was appointed to the new position of executive assistant to the chairman while Edmund P. Jensen was appointed president as a replacement to Mays, and Roger L. Breezley was appointed to the new post of chief operating officer.

In December 1986, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Forest Grove, Oregon-based Valley National Corporation (not to be confused with the Phoenix, Arizona, company of the same name) with its five-branch Valley National Bank of Forest Grove subsidiary for $13.7 million (~$ in ) in stock.

U.S. Bancorp of Oregon made its first acquisition outside the state of Oregon by announcing in December 1986 the pending acquisition of the Spokane, Washington-based Old National Bancorp with its Old National Bank of Washington and First National Bank of Spokane subsidiaries for $174 million (~$ in ). The acquisition was completed in July 1987 on the first day that the state of Washington had allowed bank acquisitions by out-of-state companies.

In December 1986, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Camas, Washington-based Heritage Bank for $2.8 million (~$ in ).

In May 1987, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Seattle, Washington-based Peoples Bancorp with its Peoples National Bank subsidiary for $275 million (~$ in ) in stock. The acquisition was completed in December 1987. After the acquisition, Peoples and Old National were combined to form U.S. Bank of Washington.

John Elorriaga retired as chairman of the board and chief executive officer in November 1987 and was replaced by Roger L. Breezley while Jensen continued as president.

In December 1987, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Bellingham, Washington-based Mt Baker Bank for $25 million (~$ in ).

U.S. Bancorp of Oregon entered the state of California by announcing in April 1988 the pending acquisition of the Eureka, California-based Bank of Loleta with seven branch offices in Humboldt and Del Norte counties for $15.3 million (~$ in ) in cash. The acquisition was completed in December 1988 and was renamed U.S. Bank of California.

In April 1988, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Bellingham, Washington-based Northwestern Commercial Bank for $15.5 million (~$ in ). The acquisition was completed in November 1988.

In July 1988, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Auburn, Washington-based Western Independent Bancshares with its Auburn Valley Bank subsidiary for $4.25 million (~$ in ) in cash.

In October 1989, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Sacramento, California-based Mother Lode Savings Bank with three branch offices for $5.3 million (~$ in ). The acquisition was completed in August 1990. This acquisition was one of the first of a thrift by a commercial bank in the nation since legislation permitting such takeovers went into effect.

During the late 1980s, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon made several attempts to enter the state of Idaho by the acquisition of an existing Idaho-based bank, the only method then allowed under Idaho law, but failed when the price got too high. In March 1990, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced that they would establish a bank through a loophole in Federal banking law that allows the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to allow the relocation of bank headquarters within 30 miles of their present location without regards to state boundaries and state regulations. So U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced that they plan to transfer the existing branches of the First National Bank of Spokane to the U.S. Bancorp of Washington and then ask permission from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to move the headquarters of First National from Spokane, Washington, to Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho. After receiving Federal approval, First National was finally moved in February 1992 and renamed U.S. Bank of Idaho.

In July 1990, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Auburn, California-based HeartFed Financial Corporation with its Heart Federal Savings and Loan subsidiary for $107.8 million (~$ in ) in stock. At the time of the announcement, Heart Federal Savings had 29 branch offices in northern California. The acquisition was completed in March 1991 for $118 million (~$ in ).

In November 1991, Edmund P. Jensen was given the post of chief operating officer in addition to his duties as president, making him a possible successor to Breezley.

In February 1992, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the 20 branch offices in Northern California and 29 branch offices in Nevada for $70 million (~$ in ) that were being divested by Bankamerica Corporation as a result of Bank of America&#x27;s impending acquisition of Security Pacific Corporation. This acquisition gave U.S. Bancorp of Oregon its first presence in the state of Nevada.

Another major change in the organization of leadership in the U.S. Bancorp of Oregon occurred in January 1993. While retaining his position as chief operating officer, Edmund P. Jensen was appointed vice-chairman while giving his position of president to Kevin R. Kelly. At the same time, Gerry B. Cameron was appointed vice-chairman. Ten months later, Jensen resigned to become president of Visa Inc. In January 1994, Gerry Cameron was first appointed chief operating officer as a replacement to Jensen and later appointed chief executive officer just three weeks later. Kelly submitted his resignation as president in March 1994 and Breezley finally gave up the chairmanship to Cameron in April 1994.

In May 1995, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Boise, Idaho-based West One Bancorp for $1.8 billion (~$ in ). At the time of the announcement, West One had branch offices in Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and Utah while U.S. Bancorp of Oregon had branch offices in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, and Nevada. The acquisition was completed in December 1995 and gave U.S. Bancorp of Oregon its first entry into the state of Utah. As part of the acquisition deal, West One&#x27;s chairman and chief executive Daniel R. Nelson would become the chief operating officer and president of U.S. Bancorp and he would later be Cameron&#x27;s successor as chairman and CEO upon Cameron&#x27;s planned retirement in three years. Since both U.S. Bancorp and West One had overlapping territories in Oregon and Washington, the U.S. Justice Department would only allow the acquisition to proceed if U.S. Bancorp would sell off 27 branch offices in Washington and Oregon. As a result of the regulatory ruling, U.S. Bancorp sold 25 branch offices in Oregon, four in central Washington and one in Idaho to First Hawaiian Bank for $38 million in cash.

In February 1996, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the San Ramon, California-based California Bancshares for $309 million (~$ in ) in stock. California Bancshares had a total of 38 branches in the East San Francisco Bay Area in nine separate banks that included Alameda First National, Community First National, Modesto Banking Co., Commercial Bank of Fremont, Lamorinda National Bank, Bank of San Ramon Valley, Westside Bank, Concord Commercial Bank and Bank of Milpitas. The acquisition was completed in June 1996.

In September 1996, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the St. George, Utah-based Sun Capital Bancorp with its three-branch office Sun Capital Bank subsidiary for $15.5 million (~$ in ). The acquisition was completed in January 1997.

In December 1996, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Sacramento, California-based Business &amp; Professional Bank for $35 million (~$ in ) in cash. The acquisition was completed in May 1997.

===First Bank System era===

In March 1997, the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based First Bank System announced the pending acquisition of U.S. Bancorp of Oregon for $9 billion (~$ in ) in stock. At the time of the announcement, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon had banking offices in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho and Utah while First Bank System had banking offices in Minnesota, Colorado, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Kansas, and Wyoming. Under the terms of the acquisition, First Bank System was the nominal survivor, and the newly merged company was headquartered in Minneapolis. However, it took the more recognizable U. S. Bancorp name. John F. Grundhofer, chairman and chief executive of First Bank, was appointed president and chief executive of the new company while Gerry B. Cameron, chairman, and chief executive of U.S. Bancorp of Oregon, was appointed chairman of the new company, which he held until his retirement in 1998. The acquisition was completed in August 1997. Approximately 4000 jobs were eliminated, mostly in Portland.

====Brief history of First Bank prior to acquisition====

First Bank System can trace its roots to the formation of First National Bank of Minneapolis in 1864. In 1929, the First National Bank of Minneapolis joined with the First National Bank of St. Paul to form a joint holding company for both banks that was called the First Bank Stock Corporation, while keeping both subsidiary banks legally separate. The new holding company quickly grew by acquiring other banks in the four-state region before the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 prohibited such actions. First Bank Stock Corporation was renamed First Bank System Inc. in 1968.

====U.S. Bancorp after takeover by First Bank System====
In September 1997, the new U.S. Bancorp, formerly First Bank System, announced the pending acquisition of the St. Cloud, Minnesota-based Zappco, Inc. with its three banks and six banking locations for an undisclosed amount. At the time of the announcement, U.S. Bancorp had more than 1,000 banking offices in the states of Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, California, Idaho, Nebraska, North Dakota, Nevada, South Dakota, Montana, Iowa, Illinois, Utah, Wisconsin, Kansas, and Wyoming. The acquisition was completed in December 1997.

In March 1998, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Vancouver, Washington-based Northwest Bancshares with its 10-branch offices Northwest National Bank subsidiary for an undisclosed amount. In October 1998, the U.S. Justice Department agreed to allow the acquisition to proceed on the condition that one of the Northwest National Bank branch offices was to be sold. The acquisition was completed in December 1998 after U.S. Bancorp sold the requested banking office to Centennial Bank of Eugene.

At the end of 1998, Gerry Cameron retired as chairman and handed the position over to John Grundhofer who added the title of chairman to his other positions of president and chief executive officer.

In February 1999, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the San Diego-based Bank of Commerce with its 10 branch offices for $314 million (~$ in ) in stock. The acquisition was finalized in July 1999.
r
In May 1999, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Newport Beach, California-based Western Bancorp with its Santa Monica Bank and Southern California Bank subsidiaries and a total of 31 branch offices for $904 million (~$ in ) in stock. At the time of the announcement, U.S. Bancorp had 98 branch offices within California. The acquisition was finalized in November 1999 for $1.04 billion (~$ in ) in stock.
In July 1999, Philip G. Heasley was appointed president and chief operating officer of U.S. Bancorp. John Grundhofer had handed over the position of president to Heasley while still retaining the titles of chairman and chief executive officer. Heasley had assisted Grundhofer in turning the company around from near insolvency when the company was originally known as First Bank until it became a successful financial institution that became large enough to be absorb other banks, including U.S. Bancorp of Oregon in 1997. Heasley resigned the following year to join Bank One as the head of their First USA credit card unit around the same time Firstar was about to takeover U.S. Bancorp.

In September 1999, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the San Diego-based Peninsula Bank with its 11 branch offices for $104 million (~$ in ) in stock. In early January 2000, a group of Peninsula Bank stockholders tried to stop the merger because the initial merger agreement was made prior to the huge 27% single-day drop in the value of U.S. Bancorp stock which effectively lowered the purchase price. The acquisition was later completed in January 2000 at a 10% reduction of the original price negotiated.

In June 2000, U.S. Bancorp announced the acquisition of the San Diego-based Scripps Financial Corporation with its nine-branch office Scripps Bank subsidiary for $155 million (~$ in ) in stock. The acquisition was completed in October 2000.

===Firstar era===
In October 2000, Firstar Corporation of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, announced the pending acquisition of U.S. Bancorp for $21 billion (~$ in ) in stock. The merger was completed on February 27, 2001. While Firstar was the nominal survivor, the merged company took the U.S. Bancorp name and moved to old U.S. Bancorp&#x27;s headquarters in Minneapolis. Under the merger agreement, Jerry Grundhofer, president and chief executive officer of Firstar, would continue in those positions in the combined company while his older brother, John Grundhofer, chairman, president and chief executive officer of U.S. Bancorp, would serve as chairman of the board in the combined company until his planned retirement on December 31, 2002. The merged company retained some administrative functions in Milwaukee and Cincinnati.

To allow the merger to proceed, the U.S. Department of Justice required Firstar to sell 11 branch offices in the Minneapolis-area and 2 in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Bremer Bank of Saint Paul, Minnesota, purchased the 11 Minneapolis-area Firstar offices while Liberty Bank of West Des Moines, Iowa, purchased the 2 Council Bluffs offices.

====Brief history of Firstar prior to acquisition====

Firstar Corporation traced its roots to the founding of the Farmer&#x27;s and Millers Bank in Milwaukee in 1853, which by 1919 evolved into First Wisconsin National Bank. However, the Firstar that took over U.S. Bancorp in 2001 was actually the same company and leadership that acquired Firstar 27 months earlier in 1998, namely Star Banc Corporation. That bank, in turn, traced its roots to the founding of First National Bank of Cincinnati in 1863. Jerry Grundhofer and his team from Star Banc were instrumental in both acquisitions.

Present-day U.S. Bancorp retains Star Banc&#x27;s pre-1998 stock price history. As mentioned above, it claims 1863 as its founding date, and operates under the charter originally granted to First National Bank of Cincinnati. Additionally, all SEC filings before 1998 are under Star Banc, and all filings from 1998 to 2000 are under Firstar.

====U.S. Bancorp after takeover by Firstar====
In April 2001, the new U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of all 20 branch offices in California of the Encino-based Pacific Century Bank from its Honolulu-based parent Pacific Century Financial Corporation. The acquisition was completed in September 2001.

In July 2002, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of all 57 retail banking branches of the San Mateo, California-based Bay View Bank from its Bay View Capital Corporation parent for $429 million (~$ in ). The acquisition was completed in November 2002.

On New Years Day 2003, John Grundhofer retired as chairman of U.S. Bancorp and handed the position to his younger brother Jerry Grundhofer, who added the title of chairman to his other positions of president and chief executive officer in the corporation.

In May 2004, U.S. Bancorp announced that it was acquiring the $34 billion (~$ in ) corporate trust bond administration business from National City Corporation.

In October 2004, Richard K. Davis was appointed chief operating officer and president of U.S. Bancorp. Jerry Grundhofer had handed over the position of president to Davis while still retaining the titles of chairman and chief executive officer. Davis had been a protege of Grundhofer since their days together at Star Banc Corporation and had assisted in the takeover of Firstar by Star Banc in 1998 and the later acquisition of U.S. Bancorp by Firstar in 2001.

U.S. Bancorp acquired Genpass along with its MoneyPass ATM network subsidiary for an undisclosed amount in May 2005.

In November 2005, U.S. Bancorp announced that it was acquiring the $410 billion corporate trust and institutional custody businesses of Wachovia Corporation for $720 million in cash.

In July 2006, U.S. Bancorp announced that it was acquiring the $123 billion (~$ in ) municipal and corporate bond trustee business from SunTrust.

In June 2006, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Avon, Colorado-based Vail Banks Inc. with its WestStar Bank subsidiary and 23 locations for $98.6 million (~$ in ) in cash. The acquisition was completed in September 2006.

In November 2006, U.S. Bancorp announced that it was acquiring the $30 billion (~$ in ) municipal bond trustee business from LaSalle Bank.

In November 2006, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Great Falls, Montana-based United Financial Corporation with its Heritage Bank subsidiary for $71 million (~$ in ) in stock. The acquisition was completed in February 2007 and nearly double the branch presence of U.S. Bank in Montana.

In December 2006, Jerry Grundhofer handed over the position of chief executive officer to president Richard Davis while Grundhofer remained chairman until his retirement the following year in December 2007. After Grundhofer retirement in December 2007, Davis added the position of chairman to his other titles of president and chief executive officer.

In March 2008, the U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the seven-office Los Angeles-based Mellon 1st Business Bank from the Bank of New York Mellon for an undisclosed amount in cash. The acquisition was completed in June 2008.

On November 14, 2008, the U.S. Treasury invested $6,599,000,000 (~$ in ) in preferred stock and warrants in the company via the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Weeks earlier, U.S. Bancorp has entered into acquisition talks with National City Corp. and had made an offer to buy National City until PNC Financial Services used its portion of TARP funds to outbid U.S. Bancorp and acquire National City instead. Had National City accepted U.S. Bancorp&#x27;s offer, U.S. Bancorp would have expanded into Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania (three states that as of 2023 still don&#x27;t have a retail presence from U.S. Bancorp), but major divestments would&#x27;ve been made in Midwestern states, especially Ohio.

On November 21, 2008, the company acquired the failed Downey Savings &amp; Loan Association and also the failed Pomona First Federal Bancorp in a transaction facilitated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for an undisclosed amount. Downey Savings had 170 branch offices in California and five branch offices in Arizona while PFF Bank had 38 branch offices in Southern California.

In April 2009, U.S. Bancorp acquired the assets and deposits of the failed Ketchum, Idaho-based First Bank of Idaho in a transaction facilitated by the FDIC. First Bank of Idaho had seven offices in Idaho and Wyoming, some of which operated under the name First Bank of the Tetons.

On June 17, 2009, the company redeemed the $6.6 billion of preferred stock and on July 15, 2009, it completed the purchase of a warrant held by the U.S. Treasury Department. This effectively concluded U.S. Bancorp&#x27;s participation in the Capital Purchase Program. It was the first bank to repay the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds.
On October 5, 2009, the company announced its acquisition of the $8 billion (~$ in ) mutual fund administration and accounting servicing division of Fiduciary Management, Inc. for an undisclosed amount.

On October 7, 2009, the company agreed to buy the bond trustee business of First Citizens Bank, a subsidiary of First Citizens BancShares Inc. for an undisclosed amount.

On October 20, 2009, the company completed a transaction to purchase the failed FBOP Corporation&#x27;s nine subsidiary banks from the FDIC for an undisclosed amount. The banks included BankUSA, National Association with 2 offices in Arizona, Cal National Bank with 68 offices in California, Citizens National Bank with 1 office in Texas, Community Bank of Lemont with 1 office in Illinois, Madisonville State Bank with 1 office in Texas, North Houston Bank with 1 office in Texas, Pacific National Bank with 17 offices in California, Park National Bank with 31 offices in Illinois, and San Diego National Bank with 28 offices in California.

Since the company did not have a previous presence in Texas nor want one in the near future, the company subsequently sold the three banks in Texas in 2010 to Houston-based Prosperity Bancshares for an undisclosed amount. Each of the banks had one office each.

In October 2009, BB&amp;T Corporation (now Truist Financial) announced the pending sale of its Nevada banking operations to U.S. Bancorp for an undisclosed amount. BB&amp;T had just acquired the 21 offices in Nevada through a transaction facilitated by the FDIC for disposal of the assets and deposits of the failed Alabama-based Colonial BancGroup but BB&amp;T had no desire to expand west of Texas while it wanted to keep the other Colonial former locations in the Southeastern United States. The acquisition was completed in January 2010.

In July 2010, U.S. Bancorp sold its FAF Advisors subsidiary to Nuveen Investments for $80 million (~$ in ) and a 9.5% stake in Nuveen.

In 2010, Huntington Bancshares announced it would take over the leases of bank branches inside Giant Eagle locations in Ohio, largely replacing U.S. Bancorp but also replacing branches from FirstMerit Corporation (which itself would be acquired by Huntington in 2016) and Citizens Financial Group; the deal didn&#x27;t affect Citizens branches inside Giant Eagle locations in Pennsylvania. The deal mostly didn&#x27;t affect U.S. Bancorp, but it did lead to the withdrawal from the Youngstown, Ohio market since U.S. Bancorp&#x27;s only branches in the area were inside Giant Eagle locations; the branches had been a holdover from the Firstar days. By 2020, U.S. Bancorp had organically become Ohio&#x27;s largest bank by deposits despite not having a presence in the Youngstown and Toledo markets and ahead of major banks based in Ohio (Huntington, Fifth Third Bank &amp; KeyBank), PNC Bank, and Chase Bank.

In January 2011, U.S. Bancorp acquired the assets and deposits of the failed First Community Bank of New Mexico in a transaction facilitated by the FDIC for an asset discount of approximately $380 million (~$ in ). The acquisition had included 35 offices in New Mexico and 3 offices in Arizona.

In January 2012, the company acquired the assets and deposits of the failed Knoxville, Tennessee-based BankEast in a transaction facilitated by the FDIC for an asset discount of approximately $67.5 million (~$ in ). The acquisition had included 10 offices in the Knoxville area.

In March 2013, U.S. Bancorp announced that it was acquiring the $57 billion (~$ in ) municipal bond trustee business from Deutsche Bank.

In January 2014, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of 94 branch offices of the Charter One Bank in Chicago from the RBS Citizens Financial Group for $315 million (~$ in ), doubling its market share in Chicago. 13 Charter One branches were closed due to their close proximity to existing U.S. Bank offices. The acquisition was completed in June 2014.

In January 2015, chief financial officer Andrew Cecere was promoted to chief operating officer. A year later, Cecere was given the additional position of president.

In January 2017, U.S. Bancorp announced that chairman and CEO Richard Davis was going to hand over his CEO position to president and COO Andrew Cecere in April 2017 while remaining as chairman. Davis officially retired from the company in April 2018 and Cecere became chairman, president and CEO.

In November 2017, the bank performed the United States banking industry&#x27;s first real-time payment transaction using a system set up by The Clearing House. The transaction moved a nominal amount between accounts at BNY Mellon and U.S. Bancorp in three seconds, inaugurating the first new payment clearance and settlement system for the US in over 40 years.

In February 2018, the bank was charged by the Department of Justice with failing to implement measures preventing illegal activities, including one case of abetting. U.S. Bancorp agreed to pay $613 million in fines and implement measures to improve the monitoring of its customer transactions. In September 2018, $505 million was distributed to customers of an illegal payday loan business whose suspicious activities US Bancorp had failed to report.

In September 2018, Fiserv announced that it would acquire MoneyPass from US Bancorp for $690 million (~$ in ). The deal was finalized in March 2019. The sale did not include Elan&#x27;s credit card division, which issued some of the most prominent cards including Fidelity, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. In December 2019, the bank dismissed Emily James, a Portland, Ore., call-center employee, and her supervisor, after James gave $20 (~$ in ) of her own money to Marc Eugenio. On Christmas Eve, Eugenio ran out of gasoline and cash, and he was stranded at a gas station when his U.S. Bank debit card was rejected because funds he had deposited two days earlier had not yet been released into his account. After an unsuccessful attempt to release the funds, James met Eugenio at the gas station during her break and offered him $20 from her own pocket as a Christmas Eve act of kindness. She was fired from her job for violating company policy, but rehired after an investigation prompted by an article from Nicolas Kristof was published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In May 2020, the US Bancorp Center in downtown Minneapolis was damaged by rioting during the George Floyd protests in Minneapolis–Saint Paul. Two other bank branch locations on East Lake Street in Minneapolis were destroyed by arson. US Bancorp rebuilt the damaged branch location at 919 East Lake Street and donated the property at 2800 East Lake Street for redevelopment as an affordable housing project.

On September 21, 2021, U.S. Bancorp agreed to purchase MUFG Union Bank&#x27;s consumer business for $8 billion (~$ in ). It is the bank&#x27;s biggest deal since 2001 when it merged with Milwaukee-based Firstar Corp. for $21 billion (~$ in ). The deal with MUFG Union Bank will add $58 billion in loans to U.S. Bancorp&#x27;s current base of $294 billion and will give U.S. Bancorp a large presence on the U.S. West Coast, especially California. The combined bank will have $723 billion in assets. U.S. regulatory approval for the merger was announced on October 16 of 2022, and was completed as of December 1, 2022. 

In May 2022, Bancorp announced a five-year community benefits plan, developed in coordination with the NCRC and the CRC as part of the planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank. The $100 billion community plan is set over five years and is focusing on supporting equitable access to capital for low- and moderate-income communities and communities of color.

In August 2023, Mitsubishi UFG Financial Group Inc, former parent company of MUFG Union Bank it sold 8 months earlier to U.S. Bancorp, announced it would be buying a $936 million stake in U.S. Bancorp. The deal swaps debt with equity, strengthening U.S. Bancorp&#x27;s alliance with Japan&#x27;s largest bank.

<doc id="523004" wikidata="Q321814" url="?curid=523004" title="Mixolydian mode">
<text>Mixolydian mode may refer to one of three things: the name applied to one of the ancient Greek &quot;harmoniai&quot; or &quot;tonoi&quot;, based on a particular octave species or scale; one of the medieval church modes; or a modern musical mode or diatonic scale, related to the medieval mode. (The Hypomixolydian mode of medieval music, by contrast, has no modern counterpart.)
The modern diatonic mode is the scale forming the basis of both the rising and falling forms of Harikambhoji in Carnatic music, the classical music form of southern India, or Khamaj in Hindustani music, the classical music form of northern India.

==Greek Mixolydian==
The idea of a Mixolydian mode comes from the music theory of ancient Greece. The invention of the ancient Greek Mixolydian mode was attributed to Sappho, the poet and musician. However, what the ancient Greeks thought of as Mixolydian is very different from the modern interpretation of the mode. The prefix &quot;mixo&quot;- (-) means &quot;mixed&quot;, referring to its resemblance to the Lydian mode.

In Greek theory, the Mixolydian &quot;tonos&quot; (the term &quot;mode&quot; is a later Latin term) employs a scale (or &quot;octave species&quot;) corresponding to the Greek Hypolydian mode inverted. In its diatonic genus, this is a scale descending from &quot;paramese&quot; to &quot;hypate hypaton&quot;: in the diatonic genus, a whole tone (&quot;paramese&quot; to &quot;mese&quot;) followed by two conjunct inverted Lydian tetrachords (each being two whole tones followed by a semitone descending). This diatonic genus of the scale is roughly the equivalent of playing all the white notes of a piano from B to B, which is also known as modern Locrian mode.
In the chromatic and enharmonic genera, each tetrachord consists of a minor third plus two semitones, and a major third plus two quarter tones, respectively.


==Medieval Mixolydian and Hypomixolydian==
The term &quot;Mixolydian&quot; was originally used to designate one of the traditional &quot;harmoniai&quot; of Greek theory. It was appropriated later (along with six other names) by 2nd-century theorist Ptolemy to designate his seven &quot;tonoi&quot; or transposition keys. Four centuries later, Boethius interpreted Ptolemy in Latin, still with the meaning of transposition keys, not scales.

When chant theory was first being formulated in the 9th century, these seven names plus an eighth, Hypermixolydian (later changed to Hypomixolydian), were again re-appropriated in the anonymous treatise &quot;Alia Musica&quot;. A commentary on that treatise, called the &quot;Nova expositio&quot;, first gave it a new sense as one of a set of eight diatonic species of the octave, or scales. The name &quot;Mixolydian&quot; came to be applied to one of the eight modes of medieval church music: the seventh mode. This mode does not run from B to B on white notes, as the Greek mode, but was defined in two ways: as the diatonic octave species from G up one octave to the G above, or as a mode whose final was G and whose ambitus runs from the F below the final to the G above, with possible extensions &quot;by licence&quot; up to A above and even down to E below, and in which the note D (the tenor of the corresponding seventh psalm tone) had an important melodic function. This medieval theoretical construction led to the modern use of the term for the natural scale from G to G.

The seventh mode of western church music is an authentic mode based on and encompassing the natural scale from G to G, with the perfect fifth (the D in a G to G scale) as the dominant, reciting note or &quot;tenor&quot;.

The plagal eighth mode was termed &quot;Hypomixolydian&quot; (or &quot;lower Mixolydian&quot;) and, like the Mixolydian, was defined in two ways: as the diatonic octave species from D to the D an octave higher, divided at the mode final, G (thus D–E–F–G + G–A–B–C–D); or as a mode with a final of G and an ambitus from C below the final to E above it, in which the note C (the tenor of the corresponding eighth psalm tone) had an important melodic function.

==Modern Mixolydian==
The modern Mixolydian scale is the fifth mode of the major scale (Ionian mode). That is, it can be constructed by starting on the fifth scale degree (the dominant) of the major scale. Because of this, the Mixolydian mode is sometimes called the &quot;dominant scale&quot;.
The Mixolydian scale has the formula

:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

That is, the scale has the same series of tones and semitones as the major scale, but with a minor seventh. As a result, the seventh scale degree is a subtonic, rather than a leading-tone. The flattened seventh of the scale is a tritone away from the mediant (major-third degree) of the key. The order of whole tones and semitones in a Mixolydian scale is

:whole, whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole

In the Mixolydian mode, the tonic, subdominant, and subtonic triads are all major, the mediant is diminished, and the remaining triads are minor. A classic Mixolydian chord progression is I-VII-IV-V.

The Mixolydian mode is common in non-classical harmony, such as folk, jazz, funk, blues, and rock music. It is often prominently heard in music played on the Great Highland bagpipes.

As with natural and harmonic minor, Mixolydian is often used with a major seventh degree as a part of the dominant and perfect cadences. &quot;Wild Thing&quot; by The Troggs is a, &quot;perfect example,&quot; while others include &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; by Bob Dylan, &quot;Shooting Star&quot; by Bad Company, and &quot;Bold as Love&quot; by Jimi Hendrix.

Klezmer musicians refer to the Mixolydian scale as the Adonai malakh mode. In Klezmer, it is usually transposed to C, where the main chords used are C, F, and G7 (sometimes Gm).

To hear a modern Mixolydian scale, one can play a G-major scale on the piano, but change the F# to F natural.
