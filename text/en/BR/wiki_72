Seaman apprentice is the second lowest enlisted rate in the U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps just above seaman recruit and below seaman; this rank was formerly known as seaman second class.

The current rank of seaman apprentice should not be confused with the rank of apprentice seaman which was the lowest Navy rank from 1904 to 1948. In the old system apprentice seaman was followed by seaman 2nd class and seaman 1st class. (The three tiered rank system for seamen dates from the 18th Century Royal Navy when the ranks were called landsman, ordinary seaman and able seaman.)

The actual title for an E-2 in the U.S. Navy varies based on the community to which the sailor belongs. Likewise, the color of their group rate marks also depends on their community. 

* Those in the general deck and administrative community are seamen apprentice. They wear white stripes on navy blue uniforms, and navy blue (black) stripes on white uniforms.
* Hospital corpsmen are hospitalmen apprentice. They are the only rate in this community. They wear white stripes on navy blue uniforms, and navy blue stripes on white uniforms.
* Those in the engineering and hull community are called firemen apprentice and wear red stripes on both navy blue and white uniforms.
* Those in the aviation community are called airmen apprentice and wear green stripes on both navy blue and white uniforms.
* Seabees are called constructionmen apprentice and wear light blue stripes on both navy blue and white uniforms.

No stripes are worn on the working uniforms - coveralls or utilities.

In October 2005, the dental technician rating was merged with the hospital corpsman rating, eliminating the dentalman apprentice title. Those who once held the rank of dentalman apprentice have instead become hospitalman apprentices.

Sailors who have completed the requirements to be assigned a rating and have been accepted by the Bureau of Naval Personnel as holding that rating (a process called &quot;striking&quot;) are called designated strikers, and are called by their full rate and rating in formal communications (i.e., &quot;machinist&#x27;s mate fireman apprentice&quot;, as opposed to simply &quot;fireman apprentice&quot;), though the rating is often left off in informal communication. Those who have not officially been assigned to a rating are officially referred to as &quot;undesignated&quot; or &quot;non-rates.&quot;

<text>Cosmosphere is an international science education center and space museum in Hutchinson, Kansas, United States. It was previously known as the Kansas Cosmosphere. The museum houses over 13,000 spaceflight artifacts—the largest combined collection of US and Russian spaceflight artifacts in the world, and is home to various space educational programs.

==Facilities==
The Cosmosphere grew from a planetarium established on the Kansas State Fairgrounds in 1962. The facility houses the largest collection of Russian space artifacts outside of Moscow, and a collection of US space artifacts second only to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

The Cosmosphere has five venues: the Hall of Space Museum, the Justice Planetarium, the Carey Digital Dome Theater, Dr. Goddard&#x27;s Lab (an explosive live science presentation on the history of rocketry) and CosmoKids, an interactive STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) area. The Cosmosphere also hosts summer camps for all ages, and co-curricular applied STEAM education programs for field trips, groups, and scouts that meet Next Generation Science Standards and Common Core, focused on college and career readiness.

The Cosmosphere is the only Smithsonian affiliate museum in Kansas.

In 2012, the Carey Digital Dome Theater upgraded from IMAX to 4K digital projection system.

In 2015, the Justice Planetarium underwent a complete renovation, transitioning from an optical starball projection system to the Spitz Sci-Dome XD digital projection system.

In 2021, three of the museum&#x27;s oldest galleries began renovations: the German Gallery, the Redstone and Sputnik Gallery, and the Kennedy Theater. These galleries opened during the late 1990s. They will be repainted, and their exhibits will receive new graphics and new sound.

===Restoration and replication===
The Cosmosphere&#x27;s SpaceWorks division has restored flown U.S. spacecraft for museums and exhibits across the globe, including artifacts that are part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum. Two examples of this work are the Apollo 13 Command Module &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and the &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; – both on display at the Cosmosphere. The Cosmosphere built roughly 80% of the artifacts and props for the movie &quot;Apollo 13&quot; and of the replicated spacecraft hardware seen in &quot;Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D&quot;; and the TV mini-series &quot;From the Earth to the Moon.&quot;

==Collection==


Flown items included in the Cosmosphere&#x27;s collection are a Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, the &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; Mercury spacecraft, the Gemini 10 space capsule, and the Command Module &quot;Odyssey&quot; from Apollo 13. Additionally, authentic Redstone and Titan II launch vehicles used in the Mercury and Gemini programs flank the building&#x27;s exterior. A prized item on display is a Moon rock from Apollo 11, the first crewed mission to land on the Moon.

Every artifact on display at the Cosmosphere is either an actual flown artifact, a &quot;flight-ready backup&quot; (identical to the item actually flown), an engineering model, or a historically accurate replica.

The Cosmosphere museum begins with the earliest experiments in rocketry during the World War II era, explores through the Space Race and Cold War, and continues through modern times with the Space Shuttle and International Space Station, as well as SpaceShipOne and commercial spaceflight.

==Controversy==
In November 2003, the Cosmosphere released a statement indicating that a routine audit had revealed many missing items from the museum. Over a year later, in April 2005, former Cosmosphere director Max Ary was charged with stealing artifacts from the museum&#x27;s collection and selling the pieces for personal profit. Some of the missing items included a nose cone, silk screens, boot covers, nuts and bolts, an Air Force One control panel, and a tape of the Apollo 15 landing which Ary sold for $2,200.

Additional charges involved the theft of dozens more artifacts from the Cosmosphere when he left in 2002 and false insurance claims made regarding the loss of an astronaut&#x27;s Omega watch replica. Ary also failed to notify NASA of the watch&#x27;s loss.

Ary went on trial in 2005. He testified that the artifacts he sold were from his private collection, which he had accumulated through undocumented trades and salvage of unwanted items. He also stated he had received numerous personal gifts from astronauts. Some of the items in question were supposedly brought with him from the Noble Planetarium in 1976 and incorporated into the Cosmosphere&#x27;s permanent collection, and in many cases, ownership of artifacts could not be proved on Ary&#x27;s behalf or the Cosmosphere&#x27;s.

Ary was found guilty on 12 counts. On May 15, 2006, he was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay restitution of $132,000. In 2008, he lost his appeal and began to serve his sentence in a federal prison in El Reno, Oklahoma on April 24, 2008. Ary has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence. He was released on good behavior in June 2010.

<doc id="526685" wikidata="Q578376" url="?curid=526685" title="Clutch (band)">
<text>Clutch is an American rock band from Germantown, Maryland. Since its formation in 1991, the band lineup has included Tim Sult (lead guitar), Dan Maines (bass), Jean-Paul Gaster (drums), and Neil Fallon (vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards). To date, Clutch has released thirteen studio albums, and several rarities and live albums. Since 2008, the band has been signed to their own record label, Weathermaker Music. Clutch is one of the pioneers of stoner rock. 

==History==
===Early years and breakthrough: 1991–2003===
Clutch was formed in 1991 by bassist Dan Maines, drummer Jean-Paul Gaster, lead guitarist Tim Sult, and lead vocalist Roger Smalls (vocals) in Germantown, Maryland. Before settling on the name Clutch, the band used the early names Glut Trip and Moral Minority. Smalls soon departed and was replaced by Neil Fallon, a longtime schoolmate of the other members at Seneca Valley High School. The band&#x27;s name was chosen due to the band&#x27;s interest in cars at the time, and it being a one-syllable name like many bands at the time, including Prong, who the band was fans of.

The band quickly gained notice through constant touring. The 12&quot; single &quot;Passive Restraints&quot; on the Earache label was Clutch&#x27;s first commercial release, garnering attention from other labels. Their debut LP, &quot;Transnational Speedway League&quot;, was released through EastWest Records in 1993. It was followed by a self-titled album in May 1995 that gained Clutch mainstream exposure. However, shortly after its release, the band&#x27;s A&amp;R rep was fired from EastWest, resulting in all of the rep&#x27;s acts, including Clutch, being dropped. The band moved to the larger Columbia label for the 1998 album &quot;The Elephant Riders&quot;. They followed it in 1999 with a self-released groove-based album &quot;Jam Room&quot;.

The album &quot;Pure Rock Fury&quot; was released by Atlantic Records in 2001. The title track was initially released as the first single. The program director for North Carolina rock station WXQR (Rock 105), Brian Rickman, suggested that the label switch singles to another track from the album, &quot;Careful with That Mic&quot;. Atlantic did so, and Clutch achieved a surprise hit single. The follow-up tracks, &quot;Immortal&quot; and &quot;Open Up the Border&quot;, were also well received by American rock stations. In 2003 they issued &quot;Live at the Googolplex&quot; and the rarities record &quot;Slow Hole to China&quot;.

===Commercial and critical success: 2004–2011===

The album &quot;Blast Tyrant&quot; was released in 2004, their first for DRT Entertainment. The band once again enjoyed more rock radio airplay and heavy rotation on the Music Choice cable service thanks to the single &quot;The Mob Goes Wild&quot;. Its accompanying video was directed by Bam Margera and featured Margera&#x27;s &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; co-stars Ryan Dunn, Brandon DiCamillo, and Don Vito. The video was filmed at Rex&#x27;s in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The 2005 release &quot;Pitchfork &amp; Lost Needles&quot; combined Clutch&#x27;s 1991 &quot;Pitchfork&quot; 7-inch release with previously unreleased demos and early tracks. In 2005 the band saw their first lineup change since the early 1990s with the addition of organist Mick Schauer, who performed on the albums &quot;Robot Hive/Exodus&quot; (2005) and &quot;From Beale Street to Oblivion&quot; (2007). The later album was produced by Joe Barresi who has also produced for Kyuss, Melvins, Queens of the Stone Age, and Tool.

The band&#x27;s first live DVD, &quot;Full Fathom Five&quot;, and accompanying CD, produced and directed by Agent Ogden, were released in September 2008. The band also released a remastered version of &quot;Slow Hole to China: Rare and Unreleased&quot; on April 28, 2009. The band&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;Strange Cousins from the West&quot;, was released on July 14, 2009. Songs from the album were played live on tour prior to the album&#x27;s recording. A two-disc DVD set &quot;Clutch Live at the 9:30&quot; was released on May 11, 2010, by the band&#x27;s own label, Weathermaker Music. The set includes the entire December 28, 2009, show at Washington, D.C.&#x27;s 9:30 club, in which the band performed its entire 1995 self-titled LP.

On May 10, 2011, Clutch reissued their 2004 album &quot;Blast Tyrant&quot; on Weathermaker Music. The new edition contained a bonus album known as &quot;Basket of Eggs&quot; that includes unreleased songs as well as acoustic versions of previous hits. In its first week of release &quot;Blast Tyrant&quot; sold close to three thousand copies nationally, landing it at No. 26 on the Billboard Hard Rock Top 100, more than seven years after the original version debuted at No. 15.

===Recent releases: 2012–present===
On June 10, 2012, the band released a new single, &quot;Pigtown Blues&quot;, backed with an acoustic version of &quot;Motherless Child&quot; from &quot;Strange Cousins from the West&quot;.

On March 16, 2013, Clutch released their tenth album &quot;Earth Rocker&quot; which entered the Billboard Top 200 chart at No. 15 giving Clutch their highest chart position to date. It remained on the chart for a total of five weeks. The album also reached No. 4 on iTunes&#x27; overall Top 100 album charts and was No. 1 on their rock chart. &quot;Earthrocker&quot; won Album of the Year 2013 from British publication &quot;Metalhammer&quot;, and was rated highly on many rock and metal magazines&#x27; and websites&#x27; end-of-the-year &quot;top-tens&quot;.

In an interview on January 7, 2015, with music and entertainment company 88 Miles West, Fallon stated that the band was heading to Dripping Springs, Texas, to record their upcoming eleventh album. Fallon states the venture to Texas was due to the relocation of record producer Machine, with whom they worked on &quot;Blast Tyrant&quot; and &quot;Earth Rocker&quot;, and who recently opened a new studio there. He stated in the interview that &quot;Septemberish, give or take a couple of months&quot; is when they hope to release the new album.

Their eleventh studio album, &quot;Psychic Warfare&quot;, was released October 2, 2015. Fallon said the concept is influenced by science fiction author Philip K. Dick. &quot;His general philosophy and questions have always crept into my lyrics, because I share an interest in it&quot;, he added. &quot;On &quot;Earth Rocker&quot;, &#x27;Crucial Velocity&#x27; was definitely a Philip Dick song for me. On this record, &#x27;X-Ray Visions&#x27; certainly is.&quot; Gaster described the new material as more diverse than ever.

In April 2018, Neil Fallon announced through the radio station The Eagle Rocks that the band&#x27;s twelfth studio album would be titled &quot;Book of Bad Decisions&quot;. The album was released on September 7, 2018. The album was recorded at Sputnik Sound Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, with producer and engineer Vance Powell.

Former keyboardist, Mick Schauer died of cancer on September 15, 2019, at age 46.

In an August 2020 interview on the Detroit-based radio station WRIF, drummer Jean-Paul Gaster stated that Clutch would &quot;probably&quot; begin recording their thirteenth studio album in the winter. In an interview with &quot;Metal Kaoz&quot; in April 2021, Gaster offered an update on the new album, saying: &quot;Over the last year, we&#x27;ve written a lot of songs for our new album, and we&#x27;ve done some streaming shows too, which was something we knew nothing about prior to the pandemic. But we educated ourselves quickly, and that kept us busy for a lot of last year as well. We&#x27;ve been writing now for our new album that we will record in the fall, and I think we&#x27;re spending more time than ever in the studio, just trying out different ideas. And most of the ideas don&#x27;t ever really make it to the end; we try 10 things and we keep one.&quot; Gaster also stated that their new album would likely not be released until early 2022. The resulting album, &quot;Sunrise on Slaughter Beach&quot;, was released on September 16, 2022. 

On July 9, 2021, Clutch began a series of reissues known as the &quot;Clutch Collector&#x27;s Series&quot; in which each member picks a Clutch album and reimagines it. So far, the series only has two instalments: a new reissue of 2004&#x27;s &quot;Blast Tyrant&quot;, released on July 9, curated by drummer Jean-Paul Gaster, and 2005&#x27;s &quot;Robot Hive/Exodus,&quot; curated by bassist Dan Maines.

As of April 2024, Clutch has begun writing new material for their fourteenth studio album.

In August of 2024, Clutch rereleased their compilation album &quot;Slow Hole To China.&quot;

==Other projects==
In the late 1990s, Clutch and its sibling project The Bakerton Group (an instrumental jam band composed of all four Clutch members) formed an independent record label, River Road Records, to release their own music. River Road does not sign any other artists. The Bakerton Group has released one three-track EP titled &quot;Space Guitars&quot; and two full-length albums titled &quot;The Bakerton Group&quot; and &quot;El Rojo&quot; respectively. Clutch/Bakerton Group now runs its own independent record label for its own releases, Weathermaker Music.

The Company Band was started in 2007 by Neil Fallon, James A. Rota (Fireball Ministry), Brad Davis (Fu Manchu), Jess Margera (CKY) and Dave Bone. Initially, the bass was played by Jason Diamond (Puny Human).

Dunsmuir is a project featuring Neil Fallon, Dave Bone, Brad Davis and Vinny Appice. They released a self-titled album in 2016.

<doc id="526689" wikidata="Q602131" url="?curid=526689" title="Independent Democratic Union">
<text>The Independent Democratic Union (&quot;Unión Demócrata Independiente&quot;, UDI) is a conservative and right-wing political party in Chile, founded in 1983. Its founder was the lawyer, politician and law professor Jaime Guzmán, a civilian allied with Augusto Pinochet. Guzmán was a senator from 1990 until his murder by communist guerrillas on April 1, 1991.

Its ideological origins date back to Guzmán&#x27;s Guildist Movement, born out of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in 1966, espousing the independence and depoliticization of intermediate bodies of civil society. The UDI is today a conservative political party with strong links to the Opus Dei, that opposes abortion in nearly all or all cases.

UDI has for most of its history formed coalitions with National Renewal (RN) and other minor movements under different names such as; Participación y Progreso (1992), Unión por el Progreso de Chile (1993), Alliance for Chile (1999–2009, 2013), Coalition for Change (2009–2012) and Chile Vamos (2015–present). UDI was the largest political party in Congress between 2010 and 2014. The party has been part of the government coalition twice, from 2010 to 2014 and 2018 to 2022.

The party has liberal-conservative and social-conservative factions. The social-conservative faction is characterised by its political work in poor sectors, while the liberal-conservative faction is characterised by its connections to Chile&#x27;s business class, its links to think tanks such as Libertad y Desarrollo (LyD), and its training of young political leaders, often students from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (PUC) such as Jaime Bellolio or Javier Macaya.

==History==

===Origins (1967–1988)===
It was during the university strikes of the 1960s when Jaime Guzmán, President of the Law Students Union at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, who opposed the protests and strikes led by the Christian-democrats and left-wing students- gathered a group of students and founded the &quot;Movimiento Gremial&quot; (Guildist Movement) and ran for the university&#x27;s Student Union (Federación de Estudiantes) election. The movement quickly became one of the most important in the Catholic University, and later won the presidency of the university&#x27;s Student Union.

Jaime Guzmán criticized liberal democracy and sought inspiration in authoritarian corporatism, proposing the principle of subsidiarity and to invigorate intermediate social movements, by the way that these were independent to develop their own specific purposes. Well into the government of Salvador Allende, some young members of the National Party and the Christian Democrats became part of the Gremialismo Movement of Jaime Guzmán.

Guzmán supported a military coup against Allende&#x27;s government, which happened shortly thereafter on September 11, 1973 (&quot;see&quot;: Chilean coup of 1973). He was a close advisor of General Augusto Pinochet. Guzmán was later appointed a member of the Commission for the Study of the New Constitution, who worded the new constitution promulgated in 1980.

After the 1982 economic crisis, which caused the temporary removal of the &quot;Chicago Boys&quot; from cabinet, Guzmán moved away from the government and decided to found the movement he desired, establishing it on September 24, 1983, under the name Independent Democratic Union Movement (Movimiento Unión Demócrata Independiente).

The emerging movement, a supporter of the military government, had (as opposed to the traditional right-wing political groups) a strong empathy with the lower classes, in order to seize from the Marxist left its traditional domain. Amid the growing economic crisis of the time, UDI engaged in empowering leaders in the countryside and peripheral neighbourhoods that would help extend its influence in the middle and lower classes. One of them was Simon Yévenes, UDI member assassinated by left-wing resistance fighters on April 2, 1986.

On April 29, 1987, the Independent Democratic Union merged with other related movements such as National Union Movement, led by Andrés Allamand, and National Labour Front, led by Sergio Onofre Jarpa, plus some former members and supporters of the National Party and the Christian Democrats, to form the National Renewal party (RN), who managed briefly to unite all the right movements in the country. However, UDI members maintained their own identity in the new party, which caused a crisis in 1988, culminating in the resignation of all former UDI members to National Renewal. Allamand stayed in charge of National Renewal, while Jaime Guzman managed to register a new political party: the Independent Democratic Union in 1989.

=== End of dictatorship (1988–1989)===
UDI strongly supported Pinochet&#x27;s remaining in power in the 1988 Chilean national plebiscite. After the &quot;Yes&quot; option was defeated and presidential elections were announced, the UDI joined National Renewal and formed the &quot;Democracy and Progress&quot; alliance (&quot;Democracia y Progreso&quot;). Hernan Büchi, the former Minister of Finances under Pinochet, ran for president for this alliance. The alliance also ran a common Parliament list. The UDI&#x27;s option lost the 1989 presidential election, this time against the center-left Concertación&#x27;s leader, the Christian Democrat Patricio Aylwin.

In the 1989 parliamentary elections, the Independent Democratic Union obtained a 9.82% of votes in deputies (14 deputies out of 120) and 5.11% in the Senate (2 senators elected on 38). Jaime Guzmán won a seat as Senator for Western Santiago constituency. Although Guzman took third place with only 17% of the vote, behind Christian Democrat Andrés Zaldívar and Party for Democracy leader Ricardo Lagos, the two main leaders of the Coalition of Parties for Democracy, the binomial system allowed Zaldívar&#x27;s and his election and deferred Ricardo Lagos who got 30%.

=== Growth and opposition (1989–2003) ===
By 1990, Guzman was positioned as the leader of the opposition and was one of the harshest critics of the new democratic government, accusing it of softness in the fight against left-wing armed organizations which kept operating in Chile after the restoration of restricted democracy. On April 1, 1991, Guzmán was shot dead by members of the armed left-wing group Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (&quot;Frente Patriótico Manuel Rodríguez&quot;), after leaving his lecture of Constitutional Law at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. He was replaced as senator by the National Renewal candidate for the same constituency, Miguel Otero.

The Independent Democratic Union remained as a minor party in the early years of transition, compared with its ally National Renewal, but over the years managed to win preferences, match and surpass them. In subsequent elections, UDI began to grow noticeably: got 12.11% in a congressional election in 1993, a 14.45% in elections in 1997 and 25.19% in the 2001 elections, when it became the largest party in Chile, removing that title to the Christian Democrats.

In 1998, when Pinochet was arrested in London, the UDI and National Renewal pressed the Frei government to return him to Chile.

In 1999, Joaquín Lavín, the mayor of Las Condes and member of UDI, was proclaimed as the Alliance for Chile candidate for the presidential election. Even as a relatively new face, a moderate support for Augusto Pinochet and a proposal eminently pragmatic rather than dogmatic, took him to get the 47.51% of the votes against the Concertación candidate Ricardo Lagos on the first ballot, with a difference of about 30,000 votes (i.e., almost one vote per polling place). Finally, in January 2000, Lavín got 48.69% of the votes against 51.31% of Lagos in the second round. That was the highest percentage of the vote received by any right-wing presidential candidate in the 20th century in Chile.

During the first half of the presidential term of Ricardo Lagos (2000–2006), UDI established itself as a relevant political actor of the opposition. Proof of this are the results of UDI in the 2000 municipal elections, the parliamentary elections of 2001, and the Lagos-Longueira agreement of January 17, 2003 to modernize the State administration and give a consensual political solution to Inverlink case and MOP-Gate case, which affected the institutional stability of the Lagos administration. The result of this is the election finance law, high public management law and others. During this period, especially outstanding figure is the party president, Pablo Longueira.

A milestone in the party&#x27;s image came in 2003 when Longueira reported in a TV interview that he met with relatives of Disappeared Detainees, who saw the party as a serious and reliable institution, through which they could get some of the solutions that Socialist governments had not granted them. Of these numerous meetings, arose the document &quot;Peace Now&quot; (&quot;La Paz Ahora&quot;), which sought to give a sign of national reconciliation.

===Disputes with National Renewal (2003–2006)===
Also in 2003, stressed the frictions and conflicts between RN and UDI, mainly due to a dispute between the parties for the leadership within the Alliance for Chile, as well as personal disagreements between the presidents of both parties, Pablo Longueira and Sebastián Piñera. That is Joaquin Lavin, who was then leader of the Alliance for Chile and only presidential candidate, had suddenly and publicly call on both the resignation from their posts.

In 2005, UDI selected Joaquín Lavín for presidential elections again, but National Renewal launched its own candidate, the millionaire businessman and former senator Sebastián Piñera. Attempts to choose a single candidate for the right-wing failed. Piñera got second in the election, and there was a runoff between him and the &quot;Concertación&quot; candidate, Michelle Bachelet. Lavín urged his supporters to vote for Piñera, whom he endorsed wholeheartedly. However, in the 2006 runoff, Piñera was defeated by Bachelet. In the 2005 parliamentary elections, UDI maintained its status as largest party in Congress, electing 33 out of 120 deputies.

=== Michelle Bachelet first administration (2006–2010)===
During the government of Michelle Bachelet (2006–2010), UDI was the majority party in both houses of Congress and successfully fought the municipal election of 2008. At the internal level, in July 2008 was first presented two lists to lead the party: one headed by Juan Antonio Coloma and Victor Perez Varela (who had the backing of the historical leaders of the party) and one by Jose Antonio Kast and Rodrigo Alvarez (supported mainly by the younger members). Coloma got 63% of member votes.

Coloma&#x27;s board immediately got down to the details of the upcoming 2008 Chilean municipal election, and just finished it, the preparations for next year&#x27;s parliamentary and presidential election. In December 2008, the highest party leaders decided to forgo the option to offer the country a UDI presidential candidate and provided support for Piñera&#x27;s candidacy in order to avoid a fifth consecutive Concertacion government. This decision was ratified later, unanimously by party members, August 22, 2009.

In the 2009 Chilean parliamentary election, UDI held the largest plurality in the election of deputies, electing 40 deputies (one third of the House) with 23.04% (1,507,001 votes), and got 21.21% (369,594 votes) in the election of senators. Its bench is the largest obtained by a single party in Chile since 1990. UDI currently has 39 deputies and 8 senators.

In the 2008 Chilean municipal election, UDI got 347 councilmen (16.16% of councilmen) by a vote of 15.11%, and obtained 58 mayors (16.81% of mayors) by a vote of 20.05%. That year, it was the largest party by elected councilmen and the most voted for party in the election of councilmen. Also, UDI is the second largest party by number of mayors in Chile (only one mayor less than Partido Demócrata Cristiano de Chile).

=== Sebastián Piñera first administration (2010–2014)===

Sebastián Piñera, the candidate of the Coalition for Change, was elected President of the Republic of Chile on January 17, 2010, in runoff against Senator Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle. UDI and its territorial deployment was key to the Piñera&#x27;s success. Meanwhile, in 2009 Chilean parliamentary election, UDI managed to remain the largest party in the country and elected 40 deputies out of 120, representing the largest bank obtained by a single political party in Chile since 1990.
In August 2010 they met for the second time the lists of Juan Antonio Coloma and Jose Antonio Kast to lead the party, again with a triumph for Coloma with more than 67% of the votes.
Many members of UDI played a main role during the Piñera administration, among them were Joaquin Lavin in the ministry of education where he faced the 2011–2013 Chilean student protests and the cause he had to resign in 2011, Pablo Longueira in the ministry of economy, Andres Chadwick in the ministry of interior and public security, Laurence Golborne in the ministry of mining.
The party&#x27;s influence in the government forced the Piñera administration to have a conservative shift on educational, economic and cultural issues, having a moderate approach on social policy like maternity leave, taxes and civil unions for same-sex couples and directly opposing any kind of therapeutic abortion legalization. 
In the 2013 primaries the UDI candidate for the Alliance (Chile) was former economy minister Pablo Longueira in which he beat National Renewal opponent Andrés Allamand, however, Longueira had to resign amid the campaign due to his depression and personal issues. The replacement of Longueira was Evelyn Matthei representing the party and the government coalition, in the first round she got the second place with a 25,03% of the votes, the right&#x27;s second worst result since the return to democracy in 1990 so far, in the second round Michelle Bachelet defeated Matthei by a 25-point margin (62,17% vs 37,83%) being in relative terms the biggest margin of victory since 1994.

=== Michelle Bachelet second administration (2014–2018)===

The Independent Democratic Union played a main role in the opposition against Bachelet&#x27;s second administration in congress, stating disagreement and rejecting the main reforms on the tax system, change the electoral system, eliminating for-profit education, reforming labour laws, allowing same-sex marriage and decriminalizing abortion in the cases of rape, fetal inviability and in case of serious risk of the mother&#x27;s life and health and a project change to the constitution. In 2015, the UDI formed a new centre-right coalition called Chile Vamos alongside National Renewal and Evópoli.

During 2014 and 2015 the party faced a major crisis amid the controversies around the campaign funding and links with major holding corporate groups like Penta, Soquimich and Corpesca, the scandals had both political and judicial consequences, many leaders and members of the party, former ministers, senators, deputies were convicted under the scandals and the party suffered a major down in their approval ratings.

Despite the scandals and the internal crisis of the party, the UDI became again the most voted party in the country during the 2016 Chilean municipal elections.

<text>Jean-François Ducis (; 22 August 173331 March 1816) was a French dramatist and adapter of Shakespeare.

== Biography ==
Ducis was born in Versailles, one of ten children.
His father, Pierre Ducis, originally from Savoy, was a linen draper at Versailles, and his mother, Maria-Thérèse Rappe, was the daughter of a porter of the Count of Toulouse and all through life he retained the simple tastes and straightforward independence fostered by his bourgeois education.

In 1768, he produced his first tragedy, &quot;Amélise&quot;. The failure of this first attempt was fully compensated by the success of his &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1769), and &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; (1772). &quot;Œdipe chez Admète&quot;, imitated partly from Euripides and partly from Sophocles, appeared in 1778, and secured him in the following year the chair in the Academy left vacant by the death of Voltaire. Equally successful was &quot;Le Roi Lear&quot; in 1783. &quot;Macbeth&quot; in 1784 did not take so well, and &quot;Jean sans terre&quot; in 1791 was almost a failure; but &quot;Othello&quot; in 1792, supported by the acting of Talma, obtained immense applause.
Its vivid picture of desert life secured for &quot;Abufar ou la Famille arabe&quot; (1795), an original drama, a flattering reception.

Ducis was noted for his translations of six of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and Ducis&#x27; adaptations, which frequently involved renaming characters and revising plots, became the basis for translations into Italian and the languages of Eastern Europe. As an example, Ducis&#x27;s version of &quot;Othello&quot; ended with the title character reconciling with Desdemona and pardoning a chastened Iago.

On the failure of a similar piece, &quot;Phédor et Waldamir, ou la famille de Sibérie&quot; (1801), Ducis ceased to write for the stage; and the rest of his life was spent in quiet retirement at Versailles.
He had been named a member of the Council of the Ancients in 1798, but he never discharged the functions of the office; and when Napoleon offered him a post of honor under the empire, he refused.
Amiable, religious, and bucolic, he had little sympathy with the fierce, skeptical and tragic times in which his lot was cast. &quot;Alas!&quot; he said in the midst of the Revolution, &quot;tragedy is abroad in the streets; if I step outside of my door, I have blood to my very ankles. I have too often seen Atreus in clogs, to venture to bring an Atreus on the stage.&quot;
Though actuated by honest admiration of the great English dramatist, Ducis is not Shakespearean. His ignorance of the English language left him at the mercy of the translations of Pierre Letourneur (1736–1788) and of Pierre de la Place (1707–1793); and even this modified Shakespeare had still to undergo a process of purification and correction before he could be presented to the fastidious criticism of French taste.
That such was the case was not, however, the fault of Ducis; and he did good service in modifying the judgment of his fellow countrymen.
He did not pretend to reproduce, but to excerpt and refashion; and consequently the French play sometimes differs from its English namesake in everything almost but the name.
The plot is different, the characters are different, the &quot;motif&quot; different, and the scenic arrangement different.
&quot;Le Banquet de l&#x27;amitié&quot;, a poem in four cantos (1771), &quot;Au roi de Sardaigne&quot; (1775), &quot;Discours de réception à l&#x27;académie française&quot; (1779), &quot;Épîtres à l&#x27;amitíé&quot; (1786), and a &quot;Recueil de poésies&quot; (1809), complete the list of Ducis&#x27;s publications.

<text>Southwest Finland is since 2019 the official name in English for the region in the southwest of Finland hitherto known as Finland Proper. In Finnish and Swedish, the region still retains the previous name (, ; ). It borders the regions of Satakunta, Pirkanmaa, Tavastia Proper (Kanta-Häme), Uusimaa, and Åland. The region&#x27;s capital and most populous city is Turku, which was the capital city of Finland before Helsinki.

The area is largely the same as the historical province of Finland Proper, so named because it is the original home of the tribe known as the Finns proper.

== Origin of the name Finland Proper ==

The name of Finland Proper has a historical function. In historic times, in the area of the present Southern Finland lived three tribes, which were the Finns proper, the Tavastians and the Karelians. The southwestern part of the country, the province where the Finns proper lived, was simply called Finland (Finnish: &quot;Suomi&quot;). In the 17th century the name began to be used to refer to the whole land and a specified name for the lesser Finland was required. The first notes &quot;Fennigia specialiter dicta&quot; and &quot;Fennigia presse dicta&quot; were recorded in Latin in the 1650s, and the Swedish &quot;Finland för sig sielft&quot; and &quot;Egenteliga Finland&quot; later in the 18th century. The modern form &quot;Egentliga Finland&quot; was in official use at the end of the century, and the Finnish term &quot;Varsinais-Suomi&quot; became established only around the 1850s.

== Geography ==

Southwest Finland&#x27;s nature differs from other regions. The most notable biotopes are the Archipelago Sea and groves. 80% of Finland&#x27;s insect species can be found in Southwest Finland. There are around 20,000 islands near the coast.

The southernmost point of Southwest Finland and the southernmost inhabited island is Utö. Its highest point is 164 meters in Kiikala.

== Historical provinces ==
== Heraldry ==
The region uses the coat of arms of the historical province of Finland Proper. The knight&#x27;s helmet motif on the coat of arms has been interpreted as symbolizing born of the court of Duke of Finland, the in the southern part of the duchy, as well as the region&#x27;s position as the center of the eastern parts of Sweden known as &quot;Österland&quot;.

He made clutch contributions to the Mets&#x27; World Series championship in 1986, including a 12th-inning single against the Houston Astros to win Game 5 of the NLCS and a 10th-inning single against the Boston Red Sox to start the comeback rally in Game 6 of the World Series. He is one of only four players to be named captain of the Mets, and the Expos retired his number 8.

After leaving the major leagues, Carter coached baseball at the college and minor-league levels. In 2003, Carter was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, becoming the first Hall of Famer whose plaque depicts him as a member of the Montreal Expos.

== Early life ==
Carter was born in the Los Angeles suburb of Culver City in 1954 to Jim Carter, an aircraft worker, and his wife, Inge. One month after Carter turned 12 in 1966, his 37-year-old mother died of leukemia.

Athletic at a young age, Carter, along with four other boys, won the seven-year-old category of the first national Punt, Pass, and Kick skills competition in 1961. Carter attended Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton, where he played football as a quarterback and baseball as an infielder, graduating in 1972. He also played American Legion Baseball and was named the 1971 American Legion Graduate of the Year.

After receiving more than 100 athletic scholarship offers, Carter signed a letter of intent to play football for the UCLA Bruins as a quarterback, but then signed with the Montreal Expos after they selected him in the third round (53rd overall) of the 1972 Major League Baseball draft.

== Playing career ==
=== Montreal Expos ===
Carter earned his nickname of &quot;the Kid&quot; during his first spring training camp with the Expos in 1974.

==== Rookie season ====
The Expos converted Carter to a catcher in the minor leagues. In 1974, he hit 23 home runs and drove in 83 runs for the Expos&#x27; Triple-A affiliate, the Memphis Blues. Following a September callup, Carter made his major league debut at Jarry Park in Montreal in the second game of a doubleheader against the New York Mets on September 16. Despite batting 0–4 in his debut game, he finished the season batting .407 (11–27). His first major-league hits came in both games of an Expos sweep of another doubleheader with the Mets on September 18, as a pinch hitter in the seventh inning of the opener and as the catcher in the second game. His first MLB home run occurred on September 28 against Steve Carlton in a 3–1 victory over the visiting Philadelphia Phillies.

Carter split time between right field and catching during his rookie season (1975), and was selected for the National League All-Star team as a right fielder. He did not have a plate appearance in the game but played as a defensive replacement for Pete Rose in the ninth inning, when he caught Rod Carew&#x27;s fly ball for the final out of the NL&#x27;s 6–3 victory. In his rookie season, Carter hit .270 with 17 home runs and 68 runs batted in, receiving the &quot;Sporting News&quot; Rookie of the Year Award and finishing second to San Francisco Giants pitcher John Montefusco for the National League Rookie of the Year award. He was also voted the Expos Player of the Year, an award that he also won in 1977, 1980 and 1984.

==== Expos catcher ====
Carter again split time in the outfield and behind the plate in 1976. Limited to 91 games by a broken finger, he batted just .219 with six home runs and 38 RBIs. In 1977, young stars Warren Cromartie, Ellis Valentine and Andre Dawson became full-time outfielders. In mid-June, former starting catcher Barry Foote was traded to the Phillies, allowing for more starts for Carter behind the plate. With little time at other positions, he responded with 31 home runs and 84 RBIs. In 1980, Carter hit 29 home runs, drove in 101 runs and earned the first of three consecutive Gold Glove Awards. In the NL MVP balloting, he finished second to third baseman Mike Schmidt of the Phillies, who won the National League East by one game over the Expos.
Carter caught Charlie Lea&#x27;s no-hitter on May 10, 1981, the nightcap of a doubleheader split, during the first half of the strike-shortened season. The season resumed on August 9, with Carter playing in the 1981 All-Star Game, hitting two home runs and winning the game&#x27;s MVP award. He became the fifth and most recent player to hit two home runs in the All-Star Game.

MLB split the fractured 1981 season into two halves, with the first-place teams from each half in each division meeting in a best-of-five divisional playoff series. The four survivors moved on to two best-of-five League Championship Series. The Expos won the NL East&#x27;s second half with a 30–23 record. In his first postseason, Carter batted .421, hit two home runs and drove in six in the Expos&#x27; victory over the Phillies in the division series. Carter&#x27;s average improved to .438 in the NLCS, with no home runs or RBIs, and his Expos lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games.

Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau once remarked: &quot;I am certainly happy that I don&#x27;t have to run for election against Gary Carter.&quot; However, some Expos were unhappy with Carter&#x27;s unabashed enthusiasm, feeling that he was too absorbed in his image and that he basked in his press coverage too eagerly, derisively naming him &quot;Camera Carter.&quot; Andre Dawson felt that Carter was &quot;more a glory hound than a team player.&quot;

==== 1984 season ====
Carter hit the decisive home run in the 1984 All-Star Game, earning him his second All-Star Game MVP award. Carter&#x27;s 106 RBIs (an NL lead), 159 games played, .294 batting average, 175 hits and 290 total bases were personal highs.

The 1984 Expos finished fifth in the NL East. At the end of the season, the rebuilding Expos chafed at Carter&#x27;s salary demands and traded him in December to the Mets for Hubie Brooks, Mike Fitzgerald, Herm Winningham and Floyd Youmans.

=== New York Mets ===
In his first game with New York on April 9, 1985, Carter hit a tenth-inning walk-off home run to give the Mets a 6–5 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. The Mets and Cardinals rivaled for the National League East championship, with Carter and former Cardinals first baseman Keith Hernandez leading the Mets. The Mets won 98 games but lost a tight race for the division crown by three games to the Cardinals. Carter hit a career-high 32 home runs and drove in 100 runs. The Mets had three players finish in the top ten in NL MVP balloting that season (Dwight Gooden fourth, Carter sixth and Hernandez eighth).

==== 1986 World Series champions ====

In 1986, the Mets won 108 games and took the National League East by games over the Phillies. Carter suffered a postseason slump in the NLCS, batting .148. However, he hit a walk-off RBI single to win Game 5. Carter also had two hits in Game 6, which the Mets won in 16 innings.

The Mets won the World Series in seven games over the Boston Red Sox. Carter batted .276 with nine RBIs in his first World Series and hit two home runs over Fenway Park&#x27;s Green Monster in Game Four. He is the only player to hit two home runs in both an All-Star Game (1981) and a World Series game. Carter started a two-out rally in the tenth inning of Game 6, scoring the first of three Mets runs in the inning on a single by Ray Knight. He also hit an eighth-inning sacrifice fly that tied the game. Carter finished third on the NL MVP ballot in 1986.

==== 1987–1988 ====
Carter batted .235 in 1987 and ended the season with 291 career home runs. He had 299 home runs by May 16, 1988 after a fast start, then slumped until August 11 against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field when he hit his 300th. During his home-run drought, Carter was named co-captain of the team with Hernandez, who had been named captain the previous season.

Carter ended 1988 with 11 home runs and 46 RBIs, his lowest totals since 1976. He ended the season with 10,360 career putouts as a catcher, breaking the career mark of Detroit Tigers catcher Bill Freehan (9,941).

The Mets won 100 games that season, taking the NL East by 15 games. Heavily favored, they were upset by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS. Carter batted .183 in 50 games for the Mets in 1989. In November, the Mets released Carter after five seasons, during which he had hit 89 home runs and drove in 349 runs.

=== After the Mets ===
Released by the Mets after the 1989 season, Carter subsequently joined the San Francisco Giants. At age 36, he platooned with catcher Terry Kennedy in 1990, batting .254 with nine home runs. With the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1991, Carter again found himself in a pennant race, with the Dodgers finishing one game behind the Atlanta Braves in the National League West.

At the end of the season, Carter returned to Montreal for his final season, claimed off waivers from the Dodgers. Carter was still nicknamed &quot;the Kid&quot; by teammates despite his age. In his last career at-bat on September 27, 1992, he hit a game-winning RBI double over the head of Chicago Cubs right-fielder and former Expos teammate Andre Dawson. Carter was given a standing ovation. The Expos finished 87–75 and in second place behind the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League East.

=== Career statistics ===
Over a 19-year major league career, Carter was an 11-time All-Star, won three Gold Glove Awards and won five Silver Slugger Awards. He played in 2,296 games, accumulating 2,092 hits in 7,971 at bats for a .262 career batting average, along with 324 home runs, 1,225 runs batted in and a .335 on-base percentage. He hit 307 home runs as a catcher, ranking him seventh all-time at the position. His 1,225 career runs batted in also ranks seventh all-time among major-league catchers.

Carter&#x27;s 2,056 games played as a catcher rank him fourth on the all-time list. He caught 127 shutouts during his career, ranking him sixth all-time. He led National League catchers eight times in putouts, five times in assists and three times in baserunners caught stealing. His 810 baserunners caught stealing are the most for any major-league catcher since the end of the dead-ball era, when stolen bases were more prevalent. His 11,785 putouts and 149 double plays during his playing career both rank tenth all-time among major league catchers.

Carter&#x27;s .991 career fielding percentage was five points above the league average during his playing career. When he broke the 100-assist barrier in 1977, he joined Johnny Bench and Jim Sundberg as the only major-league catchers to have more than 100 assists in a season since the end of World War II.

Carter amassed the second-highest career WAR for a catcher during his career.

== Post-playing career ==
After his retirement as a player, Carter served as an analyst for Florida Marlins television broadcasts from 1993 to 1996. He also appeared in the film &quot;The Last Home Run&quot; (1998), which was filmed in 1996.

=== Hall of Fame ===
Carter was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his sixth year on the ballot on January 7, 2003. He became the first Hall of Famer whose plaque depicts a player with the Montreal Expos logo. Carter had originally expressed a preference during his final playing season to be inducted wearing an Expos cap. Given the uncertainty of the Expos franchise at the time, Carter&#x27;s employment by the Mets organization since retiring as a player, his World Series title with the Mets and his media celebrity during his stint in New York, Carter shifted his preference to be enshrined with a Mets cap after his election to the Hall of Fame. The New York media strongly supported Carter&#x27;s preference. Carter joked that &quot;he wanted his Cooperstown cap to be a half-and-halfer, split between the Expos and Mets&quot;. The final decision rested with the Hall of Fame, whose president Dale Petroskey declared that Carter&#x27;s achievements with the Expos over 12 season had earned his induction, whereas his five seasons with the Mets by themselves would not have, saying &quot;we want to have represented on the plaque the team that best represents where a player made the biggest impact in his career. When you look at it, it&#x27;s very clear. Gary Carter is an important part of the history of the Expos.&quot; Carter accepted the Hall&#x27;s decision with grace, stating: &quot;The fact I played 11 years in Montreal and the fact that the majority of my statistics and accomplishments were achieved there, it would be wrong, probably, to do it any other way.&quot; At the induction ceremony, Carter spoke some words in French, thanking fans in Montreal, while noting that the Mets&#x27; 1986 championship was the highlight of his career.

Carter was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 2001. While the Mets have not retired number 8, it has remained unissued by the team since his election to the Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2001, he was elected into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame along with Dave McKay, and his number 8 was retired by the Expos. After the Expos moved to Washington, D.C. to become the Washington Nationals following the 2004 season, a banner displaying Carter&#x27;s number along with those of other Expos stars Andre Dawson, Tim Raines and Rusty Staub was hung from the rafters at the Bell Centre, home of the NHL&#x27;s Montreal Canadiens. In Washington, Carter is recognized in the Ring of Honor at Nationals Park.

=== Coaching ===

Carter was named Gulf Coast League Manager of the Year after his first season managing the Gulf Coast Mets in 2005. One year later, he was promoted to the A-level St. Lucie Mets, whom he guided to the 2006 Florida State League championship, again earning Manager of the Year honors. Carter was criticized, most notably by former teammate Keith Hernandez, for twice openly campaigning for the Mets&#x27; managerial position while it was still occupied by incumbents Art Howe in 2004 and Willie Randolph in 2008.

In 2008, Carter managed the Orange County Flyers of the Golden Baseball League, guiding his team to the GBL championship. He was named Manager of the Year. For the following season, Carter was named manager of the Long Island Ducks of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. The Ducks won the 2009 second-half Liberty Division title but were defeated by the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs in the Liberty Division playoffs.

In October 2009, Carter was named head baseball coach for the NCAA Division II Palm Beach Atlantic University Sailfish.

== Personal life ==
Carter met his future wife Sandy when they were students at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton, California. They married in 1975 and had three children. His daughter Kimmy played catcher for the Florida State softball team from 1999 to 2002. She later served as the head softball coach at Palm Beach Atlantic University.

Carter was an active philanthropist and championed causes that fought leukemia and illiteracy. The Gary Carter Foundation (of which Carter was the president) supports eight Title I schools in Palm Beach County with students live in poverty. The foundation seeks to &quot;better the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of children.&quot; To accomplish this, it advocates &quot;school literacy by encouraging use of the Reading Counts Program, a program that exists in the Palm Beach County School District&quot;. Since its inception, the Gary Carter Foundation has placed more than $622,000 toward charitable purposes, including $366,000 to elementary schools for reading programs.

The 11th edition of the Merriam-Webster&#x27;s &quot;Collegiate Dictionary&quot;, published in 2012, credits Carter, who rarely used profanity, with the first recorded use of the term &quot;f-bomb.&quot;

=== Illness and death ===
In May 2011, Carter was diagnosed with four malignant tumors in his brain after experiencing headaches and forgetfulness. Doctors confirmed that he had a grade IV primary brain tumor known as glioblastoma multiforme. Doctors said that the extremely aggressive cancer was inoperable and that Carter would undergo other treatment methods to shrink his tumor. On January 20, 2012, Carter&#x27;s daughter Kimmy posted on her blog that an MRI had revealed additional tumors on her father&#x27;s brain. Even as he battled an aggressive form of brain cancer, Carter did not miss opening day for the college baseball team he coached.

Carter died on February 16, 2012 at the age of 57. Nine days later, the Mets announced that they were adding a memorial patch to their uniforms in Carter&#x27;s honor for the entire 2012 season. The patch features a black home plate with the number 8 and &quot;KID&quot; inscribed on it. On the Mets&#x27; 2012 opening day, the Carter family unveiled a banner with a similar design on the centerfield wall of Citi Field.

The NHL&#x27;s Montreal Canadiens, who had purchased the Expos&#x27; mascot Youppi! and hung retired numbers in its arena after the Expos&#x27; relocation to Washington, paid tribute to Carter by presenting a video montage and observing a moment of silence before a game against the New Jersey Devils on February 20, 2012. All Canadiens players took to the ice during pregame warmups wearing number 8 Carter jerseys, and Youppi! appeared wearing an Expos uniform. In addition, Youppi! wore a patch on his Canadiens jersey featuring a white circle with a blue number 8 inside it for the remainder of the season.
Tom Verducci, longtime &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; baseball writer, reminisced about Carter following his death, &quot;I cannot conjure a single image of Gary Carter with anything but a smile on his face. I have no recollection of a gloomy Carter, not even as his knees began to announce a slow surrender ... Carter played every day with the joy as if it were the opening day of Little League.&quot; &quot;Gary actually took a lot of grief from his teammates for being a straight arrow. It wasn&#x27;t the cool thing to do but on the same token, I think he actually served as a role model for a lot of these guys as they aged. He was the ballast of that team. They did have a lot of fun, there&#x27;s no question about that, but they were also one of the fiercest, most competitive teams I&#x27;ve ever seen and obviously their comebacks from the &#x27;86 postseason defines that team. Carter was a huge part of that.&quot;

At Carter&#x27;s memorial service, on February 24, 2012, Expo teammate Tommy Hutton made note of Carter&#x27;s deep faith. The three loves in Carter&#x27;s life, Hutton said, were his family, baseball and God.

Faillon Street West in Montreal, located near IGA Stadium, the tennis stadium built on the site of the former Parc Jarry, was renamed Gary Carter Street in his honor.

On March 28, 2014, during an exhibition game between the Toronto Blue Jays and the New York Mets at Olympic Stadium in Montreal, a banner was unveiled in honor of Carter in a special ceremony before the first pitch. Carter&#x27;s widow Sandy and daughter Kimmy were present on the field for an emotional video tribute and the unveiling of the banner on the outfield wall, which reads &quot;Merci! Thank You!&quot; and contains an image of a baseball overlaid with Carter&#x27;s retired number 8.

<text>The Co-operative Bank p.l.c. is a British retail and commercial bank based in Manchester, England. Established as a bank for co-operators and co-operatives following the principles of the Rochdale Pioneers, the business evolved in the 20th century into a mid-sized British high street bank, operating throughout the UK mainland. Transactions took place at cash desks in Co-op stores until the 1960s, when the bank set up a small network of branches that grew from six to a high of 160; in 2023 it had 50 branches.

The Co-operative Bank is the only UK high street bank with a customer-led ethical policy which is incorporated into the bank&#x27;s articles of association. The policy was introduced in 1992 and incorporated into the bank&#x27;s constitution in 2013, then revised and expanded in 2015 in line with over 320,000 customer responses to a poll.

Despite its name, the bank has never been a cooperative itself. In the 1970s it was registered as a separate PLC that was wholly owned by the co-operative society it was part of, in order to achieve its status as a bank among other banks entitled to use inter-banking systems. That society, The Co-operative Group, maintains some relationship with the bank, including managing the licensed use of the brand name &quot;Co-operative ...&quot;.

In 2013–2014, after a merger with Leek-based Britannia Building Society, a failed attempt to buy a larger rival and a troubled commercial property loan portfolio, the bank was the subject of a rescue plan to address a capital shortfall of about £1.9 billion. The Co-operative Group, which had previously owned the bank outright, became a minority shareholder with a 20% stake. Following restructuring and the formation of a new holding company on 1 September 2017, the Co-operative Group no longer had a stake in the bank and the relationship agreement between the two organisations ended in 2020.

In May 2024, Coventry Building Society agreed to purchase The Co-operative Bank. Regulatory approval was granted in November 2024 and the acquisition completed on 1 January 2025.

== History ==
===Origins===

The bank was formed in 1872 as the Loan and Deposit Department of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, becoming the CWS Bank four years later. However, the bank did not become a registered company until 1971, when the Co-operative Bank Act 1971 (c. xxii) separated the banking business from the Co-operative Wholesale Society. In 1975, the bank became the first new member of the Committee of London Clearing Banks for 40 years and thus able to issue its own cheques.

===Expansion===
The bank merged with the Britannia Building Society in 2009, increasing its branch network to 373 branches.

Following the UK government&#x27;s acquisition of 43.4% of Lloyds Banking Group in 2009, the Co-operative Bank entered into negotiations with Lloyds Banking Group to purchase over 600 of its branches. The purchase was publicly announced in July 2012 and it was revealed that the branches would be initially split from Lloyds under the resurrected TSB brand. On 24 April 2013 the Co-operative Bank announced that it had decided against proceeding with the deal. The reasons given were the poor economic outlook in the UK and an increase in financial regulation requirements. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; had previously reported that the Co-operative would require a £1 billion increase in capital to support enlarging the bank.

===2013 financial crisis===
In March 2013 the bank reported losses of £600m. In May Moody&#x27;s downgraded its credit rating by six notches to junk (Ba3) resulting in the chief executive Barry Tootell&#x27;s resignation.

Over the weekend of 15–16 June 2013 negotiations between the Co-operative Group and its regulator the Prudential Regulation Authority culminated in reports that the bank had a shortfall in its capital of about £1.5 billion, and that this would be filled by a procedure known as a &quot;bail-in&quot; scheme. Bank chairman Paul Flowers resigned shortly before the announcement of the shortfall. A press release by the bank issued on 17 June 2013 explained that the scheme would compel subordinated (also known as junior) bondholders to convert some or all of their assets from debt instruments to ownership (&quot;equity&quot;) shares of uncertain value which would be listed on the London Stock Exchange and a new fixed income instrument. The scheme contrasted with the rescues of other British banks in 2008 and 2009 when central government introduced new capital into the failed institutions. Details of the outcome for small retail investors in the bank were uncertain at the time of the June announcement, but there was no suggestion that ordinary deposits in the bank would be put at any additional risk by the rescue, as they would continue to be covered by the existing compensation scheme. The bondholders had the opportunity to seek to reject the restructuring proposed, and an alternative option of the Bank of England taking over the ownership of the bank under the Banking Act 2009 special resolution regime was considered.

In September it was discovered that there was a £3.6bn funding gap between the value the Co-operative Bank placed on its loan portfolio and the actual value it would realise if forced to sell the assets. In October it was reported that the Co-operative Group had been forced to renegotiate the bank&#x27;s £1.5bn rescue with US hedge funds Aurelius Capital Management, Beach Point Capital Management, and Silver Point Capital that owned its debt. As a result, the group would lose majority control of its banking arm with the proportion of the bank&#x27;s equity remaining under its ownership dropping to 30%, less than the 75% proposed in the original rescue plan. The plan passed a creditor vote and on 18 December 2013 a judge on the High Court of England and Wales allowed the plan to move forward.

An independent review commissioned by the bank, published in April 2014, concluded that the root of the bank&#x27;s problems lay in its 2009 takeover of the Britannia Building Society and poor management controls. The bank&#x27;s auditors, KPMG, were fined £4 million for misconduct shortly after the takeover of Britannia, particularly the valuation of Britannia&#x27;s commercial loans and other liabilities, by the Financial Reporting Council in 2019.

=== 2014–16 rehabilitation ===
The bank&#x27;s chief executive at the time, Niall Booker, a former banker at HSBC who nursed HSBC&#x27;s sub-prime lending business back to health, was appointed in 2013. He attempted to refocus the bank&#x27;s strategy as a retail and SME lender. At this point, the bank was Britain&#x27;s seventh biggest lender, and the majority of the bank&#x27;s revenue was made from interest charges on loans.

Flotation on the London Stock Exchange was planned for 2014 but the plans were abandoned in March 2014 when a rights issue was announced to raise an additional £400 million. In May 2014 the bank finalised the £400 million fundraising plan and obtained shareholder approval, which reduced the Co-operative Group&#x27;s ownership of the bank to just over 20%.

The Co-operative Bank lost 38,000 current account customers in the first half of 2014 after suffering what it called a &quot;hurricane of negative publicity&quot; following the lender&#x27;s near collapse. However, this loss was partly offset by 9,700 who switched to the bank – double the number who joined six months earlier, resulting in a net loss of 28,199 customers (around 2% of the bank&#x27;s total). The rate of loss slowed significantly in 2015, resulting in a loss of 2,250 current account customers between January and August of that year. Overall, between 2014 and 2017, the number of current account holders dropped from 1.5 million to 1.4 million.

Nevertheless, the bank reported progress in its rehabilitation, as its losses sharply narrowed and it strengthened its capital position. Figures released by the bank in August 2014 for the first half of the year showed a pre-tax loss of £75.8 million was identified, compared to £844.6 million for the same period in 2013. Co-op Bank also said its core Tier 1 capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, stood at 11.5 percent at the end of June and was expected to be significantly above the previous guidance of 10 percent at the end of 2014. However the bank, as expected, was unable to meet the new Bank of England financial stress tests in December 2014.

In late 2014 the bank sold its repossessed properties business for £157.5 million, and its ATM operating business for £35 million. It also outsourced its mortgage servicing operation to Capita, transferring about 660 staff to Capita.

The narrowing of losses was driven largely by a faster-than-expected reduction in unwanted assets, including significant parts of the portfolio of sub-prime mortgages the bank inherited from its merger with Britannia Building Society. Non-core assets reduced by £ billion, and credit impairments improved. In August 2014 the bank said it had cut staff numbers by 21 percent (about 1,560 workers) in the previous year and that there were more job losses to come. The bank had also closed 46 branches, reducing its branch network by 16 percent since the start of 2014. Another 25 would close in the remainder of the year, it said. In August 2015 the bank said that it had closed 62 branches over the previous year, taking the total down to 165. This was partly due to a 28% drop in in-branch transactions resulting from a change in demand from branch to internet banking. By that point staff reductions had exceeded 2,000 workers. After the closure of 54 branches during the first three months of 2016 the bank described its programme of branch closures as &quot;mostly finished&quot;. The total number of jobs cut by the bank between 2013 and 2017 was approximately 2,700. The closure of a further 10 branches in the spring of 2017 reduced the branch total to 95, down from nearly 300 at the start of the process.

In December 2014 a Bank of England assessment measured the bank&#x27;s core capital ratio (a measure of financial strength) at minus 2.6%. As a result, the bank appointed Bank of America Merrill Lynch to help sell £6.6 billion of mortgages.

The bank was not expected to make a full-year profit until 2017 at the earliest. In August 2015 Booker said that he expected the bank would be &quot;part of the consolidation of some of the country’s smaller banks&quot;, and that stock-market flotation would remain an option for the future. He said that there had been &quot;no meaningful discussions&quot; concerning the suggestion that the hedge funds which own 80% of the bank&#x27;s equity were looking at buying up the Co-operative Group&#x27;s remaining 20% holding.

On 1 April 2016 the bank announced a pre-tax loss for 2015 of £611 million, more than double the loss of £264m for 2014. Booker&#x27;s salary rose to £3.85m from its 2014 level of £3.1m, an increase of 24.2%. In November 2016 the bank announced a reduction of the workforce to 4,015, a loss of 200 staff.

=== 2017 restructuring, investment and proposed sale ===

In February 2017 the bank&#x27;s board announced that they were &quot;commencing a sale process&quot; for the bank and were &quot;inviting offers&quot;. They said that they were also considering options other than a sale to build capital, including raising cash from new and existing investors. A statement from the Co-operative Group indicated that it supported the decision. In April 2017 the Co-operative Group wrote off its 20% stake in the bank and in May 2017 the bank began seeking a debt-for-equity swap. In June 2017 the bank&#x27;s board discontinued the formal sale process. By that time the bank&#x27;s total losses since its financial crisis amounted to £2.6 billion. It was then announced that institutional bondholders had agreed to convert £426 million of bonds into equity, which would give them a 17 per cent stake in the bank. Additionally, it was announced that existing investors had agreed to put £250 million of new equity into a newly established holding company, which would take a 68 per cent stake in the bank. The investors also agreed to add £100 million over 10 years to the bank&#x27;s pension fund and provide over £200 million of collateral to assist in separating the bank&#x27;s pension from that of the Co-operative Group. The group was due to own 1 per cent of the bank, with the bank retaining its name and ethical policy. These arrangements were implemented in September 2017 and the final 1% stake held by the group was sold shortly afterwards for £5 million, ending the group&#x27;s ownership of the bank entirely. The &quot;relationship agreement&quot; between the bank and the group is due to come to an end in 2020. During the uncertainty of the first half of 2017 the bank lost a further 25,000 current account customers. The bank reduced staff numbers by 800 in 2017 and made a pre-tax loss of £174.4 million (the loss for the previous year had been £477.1 million). In February 2018 the bank announced that its remaining branch network would be reduced from 95 to 68 branches during April and May 2018.

=== 2018 onwards: extension of portfolio and growth ===
Andrew Bester joined as the bank&#x27;s CEO in July 2017, setting out to deliver a plan to enhance the bank&#x27;s digital capabilities while developing the ethical brand further.

In September 2018 the bank expressed an interest in bidding for part of a £775 million fund designed to help banks develop their business banking services and encourage SME customers to transfer their accounts from RBS Group. The fund was created by RBS as a consequence of its £45 billion Government bailout during the financial crisis of 2007–2008. In May 2019, the bank was awarded £15 million by Banking Competition Remedies (BCR) to grow its presence in the business banking market, following its successful application for funding from Pool B of the Capability and Innovation Fund.

=== 2020–2024: contraction ===
By this time, bank was a plc with debt securities listed on the London Stock Exchange. Its equity is not listed. The bank&#x27;s sole shareholder is the Co-operative Bank Finance plc. The sole shareholder of the Co-operative Bank Finance plc is the Co-operative Bank Holdings Ltd which is a private company limited by share capital. The holding company is owned by hedge funds and other asset management companies.

During the first half of 2020 the bank allocated £11.2m to &quot;loan impairments&quot;, giving a loss for that period of £44.6m. In August 2020 the closure was announced of 18 of the bank&#x27;s remaining 68 branches – to take place by the end of the year – along with an 11% reduction in staff numbers, as a response to a reduction in branch use and historically low interest rates. In 2023, the bank had 50 branches in the UK.

In October 2020, Andrew Bester informed the board of directors of his intention to step down as chief executive officer and as a director of parent company The Co-operative Bank Finance plc. He was replaced as CEO by the bank&#x27;s CFO, Nick Slape.

As a part of wider turnaround plans, in August 2023 the bank acquired the mortgage accounts of Sainsbury&#x27;s Bank and in March 2024 announced it would consult staff on a restructure which would reduce staffing by 12%, about 400 staff.

A series of banking entities engaged in talks and offers to acquire the bank, including US private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management in November 2020, challenger bank Shawbrook in October 2023 A tentative offer was received from the Coventry Building Society which was provisionally accepted in April 2024.

===2024 onwards: takeover by Coventry Building Society===
On 19 April 2024, Coventry Building Society agreed takeover terms for the bank, worth up to £780 million. The deal was subject to the two firms agreeing a contract and gaining approval from financial services regulators. On 24 May 2024, Coventry Building Society finalised its takeover of the bank, and announced that it would not be giving its members a vote on the deal. Regulatory approval was granted in November 2024, and the acquisition was completed on 1 January 2025.

== Membership before financial crisis==
Despite its name, the Co-operative Bank was not itself a true co-operative as it was not owned directly by its staff, nor customers. Prior to 2013 it was owned by a holding company itself owned by a co-operative – The Co-operative Group. Its customers could, however, choose to become Co-operative Group members and hence indirectly acquire an ownership interest in the bank, earning dividends on their account holdings and borrowing with the Bank.

The bank also had approximately 2,500 preference shareholders, which were irredeemable fixed-interest shares. These shareholders could attend the bank&#x27;s general meetings, but only had speaking and voting rights if the dividend is in arrears, or on any resolution varying their rights or winding up the bank.

Unlike other co-operative banks, such as the Dutch company Rabobank, the Co-operative Bank did not have a federal structure of local banks, instead being a single national bank.

==Customer Union for Ethical Banking==
In October 2013, around the time of the takeover, a group of customers, supported by &quot;Ethical Consumer&quot; magazine, launched a &quot;Save our Bank&quot; campaign, to keep the bank adhering to its ethical policy and eventually bring it back into co-operative ownership. 10,000 people signed up to the campaign. In 2016 the campaign became the Customer Union for Ethical Banking, a formal co-operative, which retained the Save our Bank name on its website. The union now has 1,200 members who all pay a small yearly membership fee. In 2019, the bank committed to ongoing engagement with the customer union, through a formal recognition agreement.

== Ethical policy ==

The Co-operative Bank operates an Ethical Policy and has an ethical code of conduct as part of its constitution. The Ethical Policy is overseen by a values and ethics committee chaired by an independent director. The policy excludes the provision of any banking services to businesses that take part in certain business activities or sectors. These include a commitment not to finance &quot;the manufacture or transfer of armaments to oppressive regimes&quot; or &quot;any business whose core activity contributes to global climate change, via the extraction or production of fossil fuels&quot;. The bank estimates that it has declined finance totalling in excess of £1bn since the policy was introduced in 1992. The policy is based on a regularly renewed customer mandate in the form of a survey. In the 2005/06 financial year, whilst making profits of £96.5 million, it turned away business of nearly £10 million.

The Ethical Policy only applies to the balance sheet of the Co-operative Bank and never applied to other Co-operative Group businesses such as the Co-operative Asset Management, the group&#x27;s asset management business. Nevertheless, this business received criticism in 2009 for not following the bank&#x27;s Ethical Policy and in 2013 it was sold to the Royal London Group.

In June 2005, the bank closed the account of Christian Voice, a Christian evangelical group, because of its standpoint on homosexuality, specifically the group&#x27;s &quot;discriminatory pronouncements on grounds of sexual orientation&quot;. They said the group was &quot;incompatible with the position of the Co-operative Bank, which publicly supports diversity and dignity&quot;. Christian Voice said the bank was discriminating against it on religious grounds. &quot;Gay Times&quot; subsequently selected the Co-operative Bank for its Ethical Corporate Stance Award.

In late 2014 the bank undertook an advertising campaign to promote its Ethical Policy. The Co-operative Bank brand subsequently came top in YouGov&#x27;s survey of the most improved brands of 2015.

The expanded Ethical Policy, updated in 2015, is built on five pillars: Banking, Workplace, Products and Services, Campaigning and Business.

===Charity and community===
The bank&#x27;s partnership with youth homelessness charity, Centrepoint, continued during 2018 and raised over £1m, helping to fund a national helpline for Centrepoint, and a specialist helpline service based in Manchester.

In 2018, the bank partnered with charity Refuge and successfully lobbied for the launch of a new banking industry code of practice for customers affected by financial abuse.

==Divisions==

===Smile===

The bank launched a separate internet-only operation known as smile in 1999. It has around half a million customers.

===Britannia===
In October 2008, it was reported that Co-operative Financial Services was in talks with Britannia Building Society with a view to sharing facilities and possibly a full merger. Such a venture was facilitated by the passing of the Building Societies (Funding) and Mutual Societies (Transfers) Act 2007, although further secondary legislation was required before such a merger could take place. On 21 January 2009, Co-operative Financial Services and Britannia Building Society agreed to a merger, with the new &quot;super-mutual&quot; being brought under the stewardship of The Co-operative Group. The proposed merger was subject to a vote by Britannia&#x27;s members at their AGM, and on 29 April 2009 the members voted overwhelmingly in favour of the merger. Neville Richardson, Britannia CEO, became chief executive of the combined business.

In the short term, both Britannia Building Society and the Co-operative Bank continued operating their own products, branch networks and systems. All Britannia branches were due to be rebranded under the Co-operative name by the end of 2013, but this was abandoned in the wake of the financial crisis, with a great many simply closing and only a smaller number being retained and converted.

In June 2013, a member of the Treasury Select Committee criticised Richardson – who had left the bank in 2011 – over his role in the merger. In 2014, an independent review reported that the problems faced by both companies had been exacerbated by the merger. In the same year the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, told the Treasury Select Committee that the Britannia Building Society would have collapsed if it had not been taken over by the Co-operative Bank.

== Technical problems ==
In 2009, the Co-operative Bank received considerable public criticism from business customers for problems with the bank&#x27;s business internet banking service. It subsequently emerged that the service crashed when more than 130 users logged on simultaneously, and some business customers were left unable to access their accounts for days.

In 2011, some Co-operative Bank customers were left temporarily unable to use their debit cards as a result of IT problems.

In 2021, the Bank&#x27;s Open Banking service began to suffer a &quot;temporary outage&quot;, which is still ongoing in 2023.

==Controversies==
On 17 November 2013, Labour Party advisor and the former Co-operative Bank chairman, Rev. Paul Flowers, was caught buying crack cocaine and methamphetamine. The former Labour councillor served as the Bank&#x27;s chairman from April 2010 until June 2013 and it was under his chairmanship that in March 2013 the bank reported losses of £600 million; in May 2013, Moody&#x27;s had downgraded its credit rating by six notches to junk (Ba3) and the chief executive Barry Tootell resigned. Flowers was suspended by both the Labour Party and the Methodist Church. On 19 November it was discovered that Flowers had previously resigned as a Labour Party Councillor for Bradford Council after &quot;inappropriate&quot; content was discovered on his computer.

On 19 November 2013, the group&#x27;s chairman Len Wardle, who was leading the board when Flowers was appointed to his position, resigned &quot;with immediate effect&quot; because of the Flowers scandal.

<text>Sonic the Comic was a British children&#x27;s comic published by Fleetway Editions between 1993 and 2002. It was the UK&#x27;s Sega comic, featuring stories about its mascot Sonic the Hedgehog and related characters, as well as comic strips based on other Sega video games, along with news, reviews, and tips for games released for Sega systems.

==Format and publication history==
The original price for &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot; was 95 pence, but it incrementally increased over the comic&#x27;s lifespan, until the price had reached £1.50 by the final issue. The comic generally contained four comic strip stories, each usually following different storylines and being written and drawn by different writers and artists. The first was always a seven-page story about Sonic himself (except for #148 which began with the Tails strip), and in the earliest issues, the remaining three would involve a different Sega game character (see list below). Later, the Sega backup strips were supplanted by stories focusing on supporting Sonic characters such as Tails, Knuckles, Amy and the Chaotix. The anthology &quot;Sonic&#x27;s World&quot; featured a variety of events in the STC world not covered by the main character strips.

The different strips could at times contrast heavily with each other, with different strips aimed at different age groups or with a different balance between comedy and drama: the humour-based &quot;Decap Attack&quot; strip could appear alongside the darker and more violent &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; strip. Lew Stringer has stated that the majority of readers were aged between five and ten and many strips were written with this in mind: &quot;That doesn&#x27;t mean that older readers can&#x27;t appreciate the stories and artwork of course but it&#x27;s worth bearing in mind that if the stories sometimes seem juvenile, it&#x27;s because they are. Having said that, it doesn&#x27;t mean we can be sloppy because we&#x27;re &#x27;just&#x27; writing for kids&quot;.

Aside from the comic strips, for its first few years STC regularly featured content related to Sega videogaming. Fitting in with the Sonic convention of calling levels &quot;Zones&quot;, these sections were given such titles as the &quot;Q-Zone&quot; (which featured videogame tips and cheats), the &quot;News Zone&quot; and the &quot;Review Zone&quot;. Readers&#x27; artwork was printed in the &quot;Graphic Zone&quot;, and letters were featured in &quot;Speedlines&quot;.

===Megadroid===

The mascot of the comic was a robot named Megadroid, composed of parts of a Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. Megadroid was the persona used by the editors of &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot; to answer letters and provide story recaps and general magazine news (much like Tharg in &quot;2000AD&quot;, and in fact created by former Tharg Richard Burton). He acted as a liaison between the readers (whom he called &quot;boomers,&quot; deriving from the term &quot;sonic boom&quot;) and the &quot;humes who think they&#x27;re in charge&quot;.

Megadroid had two one-off strips; the first (#41) was a tour of the STC offices for the Christmas issue, and a second (#83) in which he ran away from the STC offices to a seaside town only to return from his harrowing experience to attend to the needs of the boomers.

Megadroid was dropped from the comic in 1998, and with him the &quot;Speedlines&quot; letter page vanished. Speedlines returned in 2000, though it was no longer a regular feature and instead of Megadroid, the letters were supposedly answered by Sonic himself (actually editor Andy Diggle and later Steve MacManus).

===Staff===
The bulk of the work in the comic was written by either Nigel Kitching or Lew Stringer, while art was provided by Richard Elson, Nigel Dobbyn, Carl Flint, Woodrow Phoenix, Roberto Corona, Mike McMahon, Kitching himself and many others. The first editor was Richard Burton.

Several of the comic&#x27;s contributors have found success elsewhere in comics. Mark Millar, who wrote the first &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; storyline and some Sonic strips, has since written major titles for DC and Marvel Comics such as &quot;Wanted&quot; and &quot;Civil War&quot;; editor Andy Diggle has since become a comics writer; and &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; illustrator Richard Rayner contributed to &quot;Decap Attack&quot; scripts.

===Demise===
The demise of STC began when budget cuts at the comic led to the number of pages being cut from 36 to 32 beginning with issue 95 in 1997 and as a result, the loss of the news, game review and game tips sections (though the slow phasing out of these sections had already been ongoing since early 1995). Despite being one of Fleetway&#x27;s biggest selling comics in 1998, from issue 133, published that July, one strip an issue was given over to reprints to save money as part of Fleetway&#x27;s policy of five-year reader cycles (issue 133 was published shortly after the comic&#x27;s fifth birthday). Later in the year, the mascot Megadroid was removed, along with the &quot;Speedlines&quot; letters page. Two further strips were replaced by reprints in issues 155 and 157, leaving just the main &quot;Sonic&quot; strip and the cover as the only new material in each issue. With the lack of new supporting character strips, Nigel Kitching was asked to share the main strip with Lew Stringer, causing the plans for the &quot;Shanazar&quot; story arc to be heavily altered.

During this time, the main strip&#x27;s stories came under the &quot;Time Zone&quot; banner, mostly being set on Shanazar and then later involving dimensional portals leading to other dimensions and Earth&#x27;s history (identical to the previous Amy and Tekno stories) due to editorial preference. Neither Mobius nor any of the main characters bar Sonic and Amy featured, and the lack of ancillary strips meant no other stories could be told. Following issue 157, Lew Stringer replaced Nigel Kitching as the comic&#x27;s sole writer.

After Andy Diggle became the comic&#x27;s editor, Stringer&#x27;s run concluded with an apocalyptic final storyline, and Kitching returned with issue 175 for a ten-part adaptation of the videogame &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;. From issue 185, the comic became fully reprint, aside from new covers drawn by Richard Elson. This happened at short notice – even Kitching was not aware that issue 184 would be his last until he requested an extension for the ten-issue storyline he was in the middle of writing, having apparently already made plans for future stories that would follow it. He revealed the cancellation to fans on the unofficial STC Yahoo! Groups mailing list on 19 April 2000, a little over two months before the last issue was published and only a few weeks after he himself had been made aware of the fact. As a result, the final story ended with a handful of loose ends from earlier stories left untied.

Fully reprint issues continued to be published until issue 223, which reprinted the four-part storyline &quot;The Evil Empire&quot; and featured an article by Nigel Kitching about his time working on the comic, an abridged version of which was posted to the STC Mailing List.

A new Sonic magazine published by Egmont Story Works began publication in 2024. Due to liscensing restrictions, issues of &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot; are no longer considered &quot;on brand&quot; and therefore cannot be reprinted. 

==Sonic the Hedgehog comic strips==
The mainline &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series lifts its lore and some characters from the western lore bible, which was used in a promotional comic for the original &quot;Sonic the Hedghog&quot; game and the UK &quot;Stay Sonic&quot; guide. Revealed in issue 8&#x27;s &quot;The Origin of Sonic,&quot; Sonic was a brown hedgehog who originally worked with professor Ovi Kintober, and became blue by running fast enough to break the sound barrier. Ovi planned to use the Chaos Emeralds to rid the planet Mobius of all evil, but an accident involving the emeralds and a rotten egg transformed him into Ivo Robotnik. After traveling to the Special Zone, Sonic and his friends are warped 6 months into the future, and have to take down Robotnik&#x27;s control over the world.

In addition to established characters such as Sonic, Tails, and Amy, unique members of the series&#x27; incarnation of the Freedom Fighters include a computer AI version of Kintober, as well as Johnny Lightfoot, a rabbit who wields a stafflike weapon, Porker Lewis, the Fighters&#x27; technology expert, Shortfuse the Cybernik, a squirrel encased in a powerful super-badnik suit, and Tekno the Canary, a scientific genius who betrayed Robotnik. Robotnik himself gains an ally in Grimer, the series&#x27; equivalent to Snively from the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series and the Archie Comics &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series. Robotnik later encases himself inside an egg, transforming again to be more in line with his design from &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog.&quot; Knuckles the Echidna debuts in adaptations of &quot;Sonic 3&quot; and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles,&quot; where he protects the Master Emeralds on Angel Island (known in the comic as the Floating Island), and reluctantly teams up with the sky pirate Captain Plunder.

Metal Sonic, known as Metallix in the story, became the series&#x27; second major recurring villain after Eggman. Debuting in the Sonic CD adaption &quot;The Sonic Terminator,&quot; he captures Amy on Little Planet (known as the Miracle Planet in the comic), forcing Sonic to rescue her. Metallix returns in a loose adaptation of &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot;, where a hivemind of Metallix robots calling themselves the Brotherhood of Metallix have taken over Robotnik&#x27;s former base in the Special Zone, and in the story &quot;The Return of Chaotix,&quot; where they take over both Little Planet and Mobius by preventing the creation of Robotnik, revealing that it was Grimer who created the Metallix.

One element of &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot; that was distinct from other Sonic fiction was its depiction of Sonic&#x27;s powered-up form, Super Sonic or known to fans as &quot;Fleetway Super Sonic&quot;. In STC, Super Sonic was a monstrous, inhibitionless alter-ego, the Mr. Hyde to Sonic&#x27;s Doctor Jekyll, into which Sonic transformed in times of stress or exposure to the Chaos Emeralds. The appearances of Super Sonic were few and far between in the first eighty or so issues of the comic, although he became a prominent threat during the build-up to issue 100. Following a storyline in which the Chaos Emeralds&#x27; energy was transferred out of Sonic and into the Special Zone, Super Sonic continued to exist as a separate entity, forcing Sonic to pursue him. After Super Sonic was defeated by being frozen in time within the time-travelling, dimension-jumping Omni-Viewer, Sonic was left isolated in the Special Zone; on Mobius, Shortfuse joined the Freedom Fighters, and Knuckles ended a long quest back to the Floating Island. Super Sonic&#x27;s subsequent escape from the Omni-Viewer triggered a planet-wide electromagnetic pulse that the Omni-Viewer shunted to Mobius, deactivating all of Robotnik&#x27;s robots and computer systems. With no technology or troops to protect him, Robotnik was finally deposed as Mobius&#x27; ruler in the comic&#x27;s 100th issue.

After establishing the new state of play on Mobius—including the now-amnesiac Super Sonic&#x27;s befriending of magician Ebony and psychic Pyjamas—the next major move for &quot;STC&quot; was its adaptation of &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot;, which proved to be the last game adaptation for a prolonged period of time. Although it ultimately amounted to little more than use of the different elements from the game (Flickies Island, the birds used for Badniks and dimensional travel via Mobius Rings), with the added introduction of a new Metallix villain (with its design based on Knuckles this time), it was a key stepping stone in shaping the direction of Sonic stories right up until the conclusion of the series. The story introduced the interdimensional alien race known as the Drakon Empire (spun out of a dangling plot point from nearly one hundred issues prior), who allied themselves with Doctor Robotnik in an attempt to acquire the Chaos Emeralds, revealing their previous ownership of the gems ages prior. Alliances, betrayals and double-crosses culminated in Robotnik&#x27;s successful capture of the Emeralds and a 4-issue epic in which he had god-like powers &amp; reshaped Mobius entirely, but when his body was drained of Chaos Energy, he vanished into a sub-atomic dimension.

A series of dimension-hopping adventures by Amy and Tekno resulted in Mobius being briefly invaded by Earth military forces, after which Sonic pursued Grimer and Nack the Weasel in their quest to recover Robotnik. Trapped on the sub-atomic world of Shanazar, Sonic found it hard to adapt to the local culture, and when Amy&#x27;s adventures led her to join him on the planet, the two explored the world&#x27;s numerous vastly different zones, combating myriad threats. Robotnik had his own plans, however, using the dimensional technology that brought Sonic, Grimer and Nack to Shanazar to enlarge the world, fusing it with Mobius in a &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;-style event. Shanazar&#x27;s zones could now be accessed from portals on Mobius, and various doorways had also opened to various points in Earth&#x27;s history. Infuriated with yet another failure, however, Robotnik decided to bring his long war with Sonic to an end by destroying Mobius once and for all. Entering into a partnership with the living plastic alien hive-mind, The Plax, Robotnik used their technology to absorb elemental energy from both Mobius and Earth, forcing both worlds into total ecological collapse. His scheme was again foiled, however, by Shortfuse, who wired his armour into Robotnik&#x27;s machine, undoing the damage and draining the energy from the villain, with the added bonus of the feedback finally liberating him from his armour.

This proved to be one defeat too many for Robotnik; retreating physically and mentally, he languished in darkness until Grimer, desperate to snap his master out of his depression, initiated the events of the comic&#x27;s final storyline, the adaptation of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; (although in practice, this would prove to be the loosest game adaptation yet, as the game&#x27;s wildly different approach was largely incompatible with the &quot;STC&quot; universe). Discovering a canister containing a creature of living chaos energy, Grimer unleashed the fear-inducing &quot;Chaos&quot; upon the Freedom Fighters, leading to the death of Johnny Lightfoot. Rampaging out of Grimer&#x27;s control, Chaos then attacked the Floating Island, intending to absorb the Chaos Emeralds; however, Knuckles jettisoned the emeralds before he could absorb more than one, causing the island itself to plunge into the ocean. While Robotnik then set about gathering the emeralds to lure all the players to his fortress that they might all die together, Sonic was transported into the ancient past of Mobius by Tikal and Pachacamac, two of the planet&#x27;s race of echidnas, where he witnessed the beginning of the war between the Echidnas and the Drakon Empire, the origins of the Chaos Emeralds, and the creation of Chaos, who proved to be a Drakon prosecutor mutated by exposure to the emeralds. Returning to the present, Sonic arrived just as Chaos absorbed the remaining emeralds and became Perfect Chaos. Robotnik&#x27;s suicide plan was thwarted, however, by the unexpected appearance of Super Sonic, dying due to depletion of his own chaos energy. Absorbing Chaos&#x27;s energy, reverting him back to his Drakon form, Super Sonic became his old evil self again and turned on the Freedom Fighters, until Ebony used her magics to fuse Sonic and Super Sonic back together again.

The original stories in &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot; came to an end at this point with issue #184, but the comic continued until #223 with reprinted material from throughout the magazine&#x27;s life.

===Characters===

====Sonic the Hedgehog====
As the central protagonist and main character of the comic, Sonic&#x27;s personality differed slightly from his typical portrayals in other Sonic fiction; a flawed hero, he can act arrogant, rude, and somewhat self-centred, being condescending towards Tails in particular (often referring to him as &quot;pixel brain&quot;). Despite his flaws, Sonic will always rescue the innocent from danger when the situation arises. After Johnny Lightfoot&#x27;s death at the hands of Chaos, Sonic blames himself and disappears for a short while, returning from his self-imposed exile with a less egocentric attitude and a stronger will. Sonic&#x27;s origin was first used in 1991 in a Disney comic then now put into &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot;. Sonic was once a brown hedgehog, he then one day met the scientist Dr. Kintobor who invented a machine powered by the mysterious power of the Chaos Emeralds. Dr. Kintobor also invented Sonic&#x27;s trademark speed shoes to help amplify Sonic&#x27;s speed. While testing Dr. Kintobor&#x27;s invention, Sonic broke the sound barrier, giving him his looks and speed. The adaptation of Sonic Adventure led to Sonic&#x27;s redesign to match his modern incarnation.

When Sonic is required to do some undercover work, he adopts the persona of &quot;Bob Beaky&quot;, a heavily wrapped-up bird.

====Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower====
Tails is Sonic&#x27;s best friend as well as sidekick. Tails is commonly insulted by Sonic, who often calls him &quot;Pixel Brain&quot;. Despite this, Tails still looks up to him. Tails was born in the Nameless Zone. Similar to Tails&#x27; backstory in the Canon games, he used to get picked on due to his twin tails. Tails eventually ran off and was found by Sonic in the Swamp Zone. This depiction of Tails does not have the genius-level intelligence of his video game counterpart, but is capable of flying the Tornado on his own, and coming up with cunning schemes to triumph over his enemies.

====Knuckles the Echidna====
Knuckles is the guardian of the Master Emerald, which gives the Chaos Emeralds their power as well as the secret to the Floating Island&#x27;s levitation powers. Following the adaptation of Sonic Adventure, Knuckles is also in possession of one of the Chaos Emeralds. In this media depiction, Knuckles is not too fond of Sonic&#x27;s character, and is notably less gullible than his video game counterpart.

====Amy Rose====
Amy first appeared in a two-part story where she was arrested by Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s Trooper Badniks for the criminal offense of association with Sonic; she had been saying she was his girlfriend. While annoyed at the fact she had been lying about them being an &quot;item&quot;, Sonic still had a duty to rescue her and did so, but to his horror realised that she was now a fugitive and would have to stay with the Freedom Fighters.

Amy&#x27;s character swiftly matured as the comic went on and became one of the most valuable members of the Freedom Fighters, especially due to her expert marksmanship with her crossbow (as opposed to wielding the Piko Piko Hammer), which she created herself. The notion of a love interest in Sonic was, for the most part, underplayed and one of the comic&#x27;s writers, Nigel Kitching, revealed he saw it partly as Amy just trying to annoy Sonic. Several times, Sonic would be left exasperated by either civilians assuming the two were dating, which Amy would play along with or her playing up the crush. Because of this, when trapped on the Miracle Planet with her, he faked being lost for two days.

She appeared often in strips, with a few solo stories by Lew Stringer where she saved the day without the others noticing. She constantly showed self-righteousness, pragmatism and quick thinking: in the story &quot;Plasma&quot; in #78, she both worked out how to defeat the villain and let Sonic believe he had as she knew that, as a symbol of hope for Mobius, &quot;it&#x27;s important that they think it&#x27;s &quot;him&quot; who saves the day!&quot;. She also took a second-in-command role, taking full control when Sonic was absent or transformed into Super Sonic. When Sonic was lost in the Special Zone, she led the Freedom Fighters until he returned in #100. At a later part of the comic&#x27;s life, Amy would be mostly written by Lew Stringer as a straightforward adventurer and had a long series of back-up strips teamed up with her best friend Tekno.

Nigel Kitching originally planned for Amy to be more of an irritant for Sonic, influenced by 1930s and 40s &quot;Hollywood screwball comedies&quot; like &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful World&quot;, but while still being a capable fighter. However, Deborah Tate wanted the character to be of a role model for girls, as she was the only female regular character at the time, and dictated that she be more sensible and mature.

====The Chaotix Crew====
The Chaotix characters – Vector, Mighty, Espio, and Charmy – were written into &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot; as protectors of the Special Zone. The storyline had them framed without losing Sonic&#x27;s trust. Along with Knuckles, this ensemble has been developed through many adventures as some of Sonic&#x27;s best friends, always willing to help out.

==Non-Sonic comic strips==
When STC started out, three of the four strips in each issue originated from games other than Sonic. After a while, they were gradually replaced by Sonic spin-offs.

*&quot;Shinobi&quot; (3 series)
*&quot;Streets of Rage&quot; (3 series)
*&quot;Kid Chameleon&quot; (2 series)
*&quot;Eternal Champions&quot; (2 series)
*&quot;Golden Axe&quot; (2 series)
*&quot;Decap Attack&quot; (3 series)
*&quot;Pirate STC&quot; (1 series)
*&quot;Marko&#x27;s Magic Football&quot; (1 series)
*&quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot; (2 series)
*&quot;Wonder Boy&quot; (2 series)
*&quot;&quot; (1 series)
*&quot;Mutant League Football&quot; (1 series)
*&quot;Shining Force&quot; (1 series)
*&quot;Megadroid&quot; (2 series)
Of these, &quot;Pirate STC&quot; and the &quot;Megadroid&quot; strips was the only ones not to be based on an existing video game; &quot;Pirate STC&quot; was based on a series of adverts for the Sega Mega Drive and Mega-CD, while the &quot;Megadroid&quot; strips were based on the host robot of &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot;.

===Decap Attack===
&quot;Decap Attack&quot; was an adaptation of the Genesis/Mega Drive game of the same name. The strip was mostly written and drawn by Nigel Kitching, although Richard Piers Rayner co-wrote some episodes and Mike McMahon drew several. The series outlasted every other non-Sonic strip, getting new stories until issue 132.

The strip contained a very absurdist and manic sense of black humour, dealing with the daily life of Chuck, Head (the talking skull who, to Head&#x27;s annoyance, gets thrown at enemies), the evil-minded Igor (who is constantly trying to kill Chuck) and the stereotypical mad scientist Professor Frank N. Stein, who is actually putting on his German accent and really comes from Cardiff. The game&#x27;s adversary Max D. Cap only appeared twice, along with his accountant sidekick Rupert, who is constantly encouraging Max to be more stereotypically evil in his mannerisms.

===Streets of Rage===
Three comic strip series based on the &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; Genesis/Mega Drive games were published in &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot;. The strip first appeared in issue 7 of STC and was written by Mark Millar, and the last &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; story ran from STC 41-46 and was written by Nigel Kitching. All three series featured artwork by Peter Richardson.

The strip was set in a city ruled by Mr. X and his organised crime group The Syndicate, who were opposed by the video games&#x27; player characters Axel, Blaze, Max and later Skate. In the first story, Axel, Blaze and Max quit the police force and become vigilantes. &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; was darker and more violent than STC&#x27;s other strips, and the stories were relatively long for the comic, being told over six parts.

==Related publications==

In addition to &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot;, nine issues of &quot;Sonic the Poster Mag&quot; were published. This comic consisted of an A1-sized poster, on the reverse of which was printed a comic strip in A4-sized sections. The poster was folded to match the pages of the comic. Most of the stories were based around Sonic, but one was devoted to &quot;Shinobi&quot; and another to &quot;Streets of Rage&quot;. Comic stories were published from issue 3 onwards: Issue 1 contained information on the two Sonic cartoon series at the time (&quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;) and the second featured game tips for &quot;Sonic Chaos&quot;.

In 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1999 &quot;Sonic Summer Specials&quot; were published. The 1995 issue consisted mainly of reprinted material from &quot;Sonic the Poster Mag&quot;, and the 1999 edition was entirely reprints. In addition, the &quot;Knuckles Knock-Out Special&quot; was printed in 1996, containing material devoted to Sonic&#x27;s &quot;friendly rival&quot;.

===Collected editions===

Four 32-page compilation books were released by Ravette Publishing in 1994. Early Sonic stories were reprinted in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog Beats the Badniks&quot; (issues 1–4) and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog: Spin Attack&quot; (issues 6 &amp; 8–10), while &quot;Shinobi: The Fear Pavilion&quot; (issues 1–6) and &quot;Streets of Rage: Bad City Fighters&quot; (issues 7–12) each collected the complete first story from their respective series.

Twenty-five copies of each book were given away as competition prizes in issues 23 (&quot;Beats the Badniks&quot; and &quot;Spin Attack&quot;) and 24 (&quot;Shinobi&quot; and &quot;Streets of Rage&quot;), although in each competition the winners were unable to choose which of the two books to receive as a prize.

===Virgin Books===

In 1993, Virgin Publishing released four Sonic novels, written by James Wallis, Carl Sargent and Marc Gascoigne under the collective pseudonym &quot;Martin Adams&quot;. These were based on the origin established in &quot;Stay Sonic&quot; and the original lore bibles and shared many similarities with early STC, including the origin of Robotnik and the early cast (Johnny, Porker, Sally Acorn, Joe Sushi et al.). The second title, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog in the Fourth Dimension&quot;, involved a time-travelling Sonic being forced to ensure Kintobor became Robotnik, in order to save Mobius - several years before STC featured a similar plot element.

===GamesTM feature on STC===
In its 87th issue, the British video games magazine GamesTM featured a four-page article on “Sonic The Comic,” entitled “Paper With Attitude,” which included observations by various people who worked on the comic such as Nigel Kitching, scans of the comic, a production sketch of Captain Plunder, and the history of STC. Amongst the points raised in the article included the following:

• Unlike a number of other comics (such as those made by Marvel) any artwork was drawn only after STC was written as a full script.

• Halfway during Robert Corona&#x27;s tenure, a new licensing agency came up with new guidelines for drawing Sonic, which included the position, orientation, and the number of his spikes varying from each angle, the fact that Sonic&#x27;s pupils “always had to be touching some part of the outside of his eyes,” and the fact that they could never show Sonic&#x27;s teeth.

• There were restrictions on the amount of violence allowed. A lynching scene in the “Knuckles” series, for instance, was redrawn to place the noose around his body rather than his neck, while in a “Sonic” story a gun was redrawn to have it fire a sucker dart. There was, however, more freedom in regards to other Sega franchises, as characterised by the “Decap Attack” series, where Kitching (in his own words) “got away with murder” and in terms of the story where the brain of the detective was physically removed to erase his memories, Kitching was “absurdly proud of this for some reason.”

• The Megadroid mascot was the creation of Richard Burton.

• Nigel Kitching decided to have Robotnik overthrown in the 100th issue because he felt that the fact that Robotnik remaining dictator of Mobius despite the number of times Sonic defeated him sent out a negative message: that evil “can never actually be defeated.”

• The news, game, and review sections were removed later on during the comic&#x27;s run due to budgetary reasons.

• Positive comments were made about the unofficial continuation of STC, STC Online. Nigel Kitching noted that the people at STC Online &quot;are producing rather good continuations of the STC strips.&quot; Robert Corona noted that he couldn&#x27;t say “how impressed I am at the dedication and talent that goes into STC Online,&quot; feeling that it was great that &quot;those guys refused to accept the end just because the publisher decided to pull the plug.&quot; Andy Diggle was also pleased about STC finding a new home, noting that &quot;It&#x27;s nice to see that STC actually HAS an online presence.&quot;

<doc id="526711" wikidata="Q5290928" url="?curid=526711" title="Lockheed HC-130">
<text>The Lockheed HC-130 is an extended-range, search and rescue (SAR)/combat search and rescue (CSAR) version of the C-130 Hercules military transport aircraft, with two different versions operated by two separate services in the U.S. armed forces.

The HC-130H Hercules and HC-130J Super Hercules versions are operated by the United States Coast Guard in a SAR and maritime reconnaissance role.

The HC-130P Combat King and HC-130J Combat King II variants are operated by the United States Air Force for long-range SAR and CSAR. The USAF variants also execute on scene CSAR command and control, airdrop pararescue forces and equipment, and are also capable of providing aerial refueling to appropriately equipped USAF, US Army, USN, USMC, and NATO/Allied helicopters in flight. In this latter role, they are primarily used to extend the range and endurance of combat search and rescue helicopters.

In July 2015, it was announced that the U.S. Forest Service will be receiving some of the U.S. Coast Guard&#x27;s HC-130H aircraft to use as aerial fire retardant drop tankers as the Coast Guard replaces the HC-130H with additional HC-130J and HC-27J Spartan aircraft, the latter being received from the Air National Guard as part of a USAF-directed divestment of the C-27.

==Development==
The United States Coast Guard was the first recipient of the HC-130 variant. In keeping with the USN/USMC/USCG designation system of the time, the designation for the first order in 1958 was R8V-1G, but with the introduction of the Tri-Service aircraft designation system for commonality across the U.S. Armed Forces in 1962, this was eventually changed to HC-130B. Six USCG HC-130E aircraft were produced in 1964, but production soon switched to the new C-130H platform which was entering service. The first HC-130H flew on 8 December 1964 and the USCG still operates this aircraft.

First flown in 1964, the USAF HC-130P Combat King aircraft has served many roles and missions. Based on the USAF C-130E airframe, it was modified to conduct search and rescue missions, provide a command and control platform, conduct in-flight refueling of helicopters, and carry supplemental fuel in additional internal cargo bay fuel tanks for extending range or air refueling. They were also originally modified to employ the Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, although this system has since been discontinued and the specialized equipment removed. The HC-130N was a follow-up order without the Fulton recovery system and all USAF extant HC-130Ps have since had their Fulton recovery systems removed.

==Role==

===USAF HC-130P/N Combat King===
The USAF HC-130P/N, also known as the Combat King aircraft, can fly in the day against a reduced threat; however, crews normally fly night, low-level, air refueling and airdrop operations using night vision goggles. The aircraft can routinely fly low-level NVG tactical flight profiles to avoid detection. To enhance the probability of mission success and survivability near populated areas, USAF HC-130 crews employ tactics that include incorporating no external lighting or communications and avoiding radar and weapons detection.

Secondary mission capabilities include performing tactical airdrops of pararescue specialist teams, small bundles, zodiac watercraft, or four-wheel drive all-terrain vehicles; and providing direct assistance to a survivor in advance of the arrival of a recovery vehicle. Other capabilities are extended visual and electronic searches over land or water, tactical airborne radar approaches and unimproved airfield operations. A team of three Pararescuemen, trained in emergency trauma medicine, harsh environment survival and assisted evasion techniques, is part of the basic mission crew complement.

Up until 2016, HC-130P/N aircraft of the Combat Air Forces were a combination of mid to late-1960s vintage aircraft based on C-130E airframes and mid-1990s vintage aircraft based on C-130H3 airframes. All underwent extensive modifications. These modifications included night vision-compatible interior and exterior lighting, a personnel locator system compatible with aircrew survival radios, improved digital low-power color radar and forward-looking infrared systems. As of 2018, with the exception of a handful of extant aircraft in the Air National Guard, all remaining HC-130P/N aircraft are operated by the Air Force Reserve Command.

===USCG HC-130H===
The HC-130H first flew on 8 December 1964. The Coast Guard began equipping with the HC-130H in the late sixties and early seventies.
U.S. Coast Guard HC-130Hs were primarily acquired for long-range overwater search missions, support airlift, maritime patrol, North Atlantic Ice Patrol and command and control of search and rescue, replacing previously operated HU-16 Albatross amphibious and HC-123 Provider land-based aircraft. Like their USAF counterparts, USCG HC-130s also have the capability of air dropping rescue equipment to survivors at sea or over open terrain. They carried additional equipment and two 1,800-gallon fuel bladders in the cargo compartment.

===USAF HC-130P Combat Shadow===


The MC-130P Combat Shadow series of aircraft initially entered service in December 1965 during the Vietnam War as the HC-130H CROWN airborne controller. The CROWN airborne controllers located downed aircrew and directed Combat Search and Rescue operations over North Vietnam. In mid-1966 flight testing began of rescue helicopters equipped with aerial refueling receivers, and 11 of the controller aircraft were modified as tankers and redesignated the HC-130P SAR Command and Control/vertical lift (helicopter) aerial refueling aircraft, entering service in Southeast Asia in November 1966. Originally assigned to the Tactical Air Command (TAC) and then the Military Airlift Command (MAC), Combat Shadows have been part of the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) since that command&#x27;s establishment in 1993. In February 1996, AFSOC&#x27;s 28-aircraft HC-130P tanker fleet was redesignated the MC-130P Combat Shadow, aligning the variant with AFSOC&#x27;s other M-series special operations mission aircraft. At the same time as this redesignation, USAF continued to field HC-130P/N aircraft as dedicated CSAR platforms under the Air Combat Command (ACC) and in ACC or PACAF-gained CSAR units in the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard.

===USCG HC-130J===
The new HC-130J aircraft are derived from the Lockheed Martin KC-130J tanker operated by the U.S. Marine Corps. The USCG has six HC-130Js in service, but they are not capable of refueling helicopters in flight. The first delivery of this variant to the United States Coast Guard was in October 2003. They initially operated in a logistic support role until they received significant modifications, including installations of a large window on each side of the fuselage to allow crew members to visually scan the sea surface, the addition of an inverse synthetic aperture sea search radar, flare tubes, a forward-looking infrared/electro-optical sensor, a gaseous oxygen system for the crew and an enhanced communications suite. Aircraft are installed with the Minotaur Mission System and incorporates sensors; radar; and command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance equipment and enables aircrews to gather and process surveillance information that can be transmitted to other platforms and units during flight.

The first of these modified Coast Guard HC-130Js was delivered in March 2008 and complete delivered in September 2019. The 17th HC-130J for the United States Coast Guard is expected to be delivered in 2024.

The Coast Guard is acquiring a fleet of 22 new, fully missionized HC-130J aircraft to replace its legacy HC-130Hs.

===USAF HC-130J Combat King II=== 
The USAF HC-130J Combat King II combat rescue variant has modifications for in-flight refueling of helicopters and tilt-rotor aircraft, including refueling pods on underwing pylons and additional internal fuel tanks in the cargo bay. The HC-130J Combat King II is also capable of itself being refueled in flight by boom-equipped tankers such as the KC-135, KC-10 and KC-46.

Lockheed Martin officials conducted the first flight of the USAF HC-130J version on 29 July 2010. The first HC-130J was delivered to the USAF in September 2010, but underwent further testing before achieving Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in 2012.

The HC-130J personnel recovery aircraft completed developmental testing on 14 March 2011. The final test point was air-to-air refueling, and was the first ever boom refueling of a C-130 where the aircraft&#x27;s refueling receiver was installed during aircraft production. This test procedure also applied to the MC-130J Combat Shadow II aircraft in production for Air Force Special Operations Command.

Given the advancing age of its current HC-130P/N airframes, all of which are based on either the venerable (and since retired) mid/late-1960s vintage C-130E airframe or the more recent mid-1990s vintage C-130H2/H3 airframe, the Air Force plans to eventually buy up to 39 HC-130J Combat King IIs to equip rescue squadrons in the active Air Force, the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard. The first HC-130J was delivered to the 563d Rescue Group at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona on 15 November 2012.

The US Air Force Reserve received its first HC-130J on 2 April 2020 when it was delivered to the 920th Rescue Wing&#x27;s 39th Rescue Squadron at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida.

==Operational history==

===U.S. Coast Guard operations===

The United States Coast Guard operates 18 HC-130H aircraft from three bases around the United States:

* CGAS Clearwater, Florida
* CGAS Kodiak, Alaska
* CGAS Barbers Point (formerly NAS Barbers Point), Hawaii

These aircraft are used for search and rescue, enforcement of laws and treaties, illegal drug interdiction, marine environmental protection, military readiness, International Ice Patrol missions, as well as cargo and personnel transport.

The Coast Guard also currently operates an additional 9 HC-130J aircraft from CGAS Elizabeth City, North Carolina.

Neither the HC-130H nor the HC-130J in their U.S. Coast Guard variants are equipped for the aerial refueling of helicopters.

===U.S. Air Force operations===
The HC-130P (to include HC-130P/N) is primarily based on the C-130E airlift aircraft, with a smaller number based on the C-130H. The USAF HC-130J is a newly manufactured aircraft. As the dedicated fixed-wing combat search and rescue platform in the USAF inventory, the HC-130 is operated by the following units:

* Air Combat Command
** 347th Rescue Group (347 RQG), 71st Rescue Squadron (71 RQS), Moody AFB, Georgia – HC-130J
** 563d Rescue Group (563 RQG), 79th Rescue Squadron (79 RQS), Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona – HC-130J
* Air Education and Training Command
** 58th Special Operations Wing (58 SOW), 415th Special Operations Squadron (415 SOS), Kirtland AFB, New Mexico – HC-130J
* Air Force Reserve Command
** 920th Rescue Wing (920 RQW), 39th Rescue Squadron (39 RQS), Patrick Space Force Base, Florida – HC-130J
* Air National Guard
** 106th Rescue Wing (106 RQW), 102d Rescue Squadron (102 RQS), New York Air National Guard, Francis S. Gabreski Air National Guard Base, New York – HC-130J
** 129th Rescue Wing (129 RQW), 130th Rescue Squadron (130 RQS), California Air National Guard, Moffett Federal Airfield, California – HC-130J
** 176th Wing (176 WG), 211th Rescue Squadron (211 RQS), Alaska Air National Guard, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska – HC-130J

HC-130s were assigned to the Air Combat Command (ACC) from 1992 to 2003, to include those Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard rescue units operationally-gained by ACC. Prior to 1992, they were assigned to the Air Rescue Service as part of Military Airlift Command (MAC). In October 2003, operational responsibility for the Continental United States (CONUS) and Alaskan air search and rescue (SAR) mission, as well as the worldwide combat search and rescue (CSAR) mission was transferred to the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) at Hurlburt Field, Florida.

In October 2006, all USAF CSAR forces were reassigned back to Air Combat Command with the exception of those Alaska Air National Guard CSAR assets which were transferred to the operational claimancy of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF). The CONUS and Alaska SAR missions were also transferred back to ACC and PACAF, respectively. However, the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC) that had been previously located at McClellan Air Force Base, California and Scott Air Force Base, Illinois under MAC and at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia under ACC, was relocated to Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida under the control of 1st Air Force (1 AF), the USAF component command to U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) and ACC&#x27;s numbered air force for the Air National Guard.

While under AFSOC and since returning to ACC and PACAF, USAF, AFRC and ANG HC-130s have been deployed to Italy, Kyrgyzstan, Kuwait, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Uzbekistan, Djibouti, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Greece in support of Operations Southern and Northern Watch, Operation Allied Force, Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation Unified Protector. HC-130s also support continuous alert commitments in Alaska, and provided rescue coverage for NASA Space Shuttle operations in Florida until that program&#x27;s termination in 2011.

The USAF&#x27;s first HC-130Js gained initial operating capability (IOC) in April 2013, permitting retirement of the first group of HC-130P aircraft based on C-130E airframes that were built in the mid and late 1960s. The first HC-130J was delivered by Lockheed Martin to Air Combat Command on 23 September 2010 for testing.

In 2009, there were HC-130P aircraft operated by the Air National Guard, and 10 by the Air Force Reserve Command. As of 2019, unofficial estimates place the number of HC-130Ps remaining at 6 airframes, all assigned to Air Force Reserve Command.

Litton, Flight Engineer, Pennington Gap PA; TSGT Theodore Trainer, Loadmaster, Wapabo WA; TSGT Robert Landry, Crew Chief, New Orleans, LA; Major Kenneth S. Wayne, Flight Surgeon, Oak Park IL; SSGT William L. Hippert, Radio Operator, Rahway NJ; SSGT Pat E. Carrothers, Radio Operator, Lake Charles LA.) set a recognized turboprop aircraft class record of for a great circle distance without landing. The USAF Lockheed HC-130H was flown from Ching Chuan Kang Air Base, Republic of China (Taiwan), to Scott AFB, Illinois in the United States. As of 2018, this record still stands more than 40 years later.

==Variants==
;HC-130B
:Search and rescue version of the C-130B for United States Coast Guard (USCG) introduced in 1959, formerly R8V-1G and SC-130B.
;HC-130E
:Modified rescue version of the C-130E for USCG, originally designation was SC-130E. 
;HC-130H
:Combat rescue version of the C-130E and C-130H for the United States Air Force (USAF) and enhanced SAR version for the USCG, with Fulton surface-to-air recovery system installed in USAF versions; many USAF versions later updated to HC-130P standard. Overall similar to HC-130E except for more powerful Allison T56-A-15 engines. 30 are built as of July 1977. 
;HC-130P Combat King
:Extended range version of the HC-130H, modified for in-flight refueling of helicopters, refueling pods on underwing pylons, and additional internal fuel tanks in the cargo bay. Initial examples in series based on C-130E airframe until late 1960s. Later examples built in the 1980s and 1990s based on C-130H airframe.
;HC-130P/N Combat King
:Additional order of new HC-130Ps without Fulton surface-to-air recovery system or existing HC-130Ps with Fulton system removed.
;HC-130J
:Modified rescue version of the C-130J for USCG.
;HC-130J Combat King II
:USAF combat rescue variant of the C-130J with changes for in-flight refueling of helicopters, including refueling pods on underwing pylons and capabilities to receive fuel inflight from boom-equipped tankers. The USAF HC-130J eliminates the enlisted Flight Engineer position, but unlike the USAF C-130J airlift version, still retains a Combat Systems Officer/Navigator position.

<doc id="526716" wikidata="Q7309447" url="?curid=526716" title="Registration of Political Parties Act 1998">
<text>The Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 (c. 48), is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which made legal provision to set up a register of political parties in the United Kingdom. Previously there had been no such register, and political parties were not specially recognised.

The legislation was introduced for a variety of reasons. It was planned to introduce some elements of list-based proportional representation in elections to the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly and also to introduce full list-based proportional representation in European Parliament elections in England, Scotland and Wales and for that, political parties needed to have a stronger legal recognition. Additionally, various pieces of legislation needed to refer to parties and so were using &quot;ad hoc&quot; definitions, which might have been incompatible.

Another motivation was the use of the names &quot;Literal Democrats&quot;, &quot;Conversative Party&quot;, and &quot;Labor Party&quot; by people in elections in the 1990s; these names were criticised as potentially confusing with the names of the three major parties in the UK (the Liberal Democrats, the Conservative Party and the Labour Party, respectively). In the 1994 European Elections, Richard Huggett stood as a Literal Democrat candidate for the Devon and East Plymouth seat, taking more votes than the Conservative Party margin over the Liberal Democrats, leading to a legal challenge by the Liberal Democrat candidate.

Candidates for election could no longer be described as an &quot;Independent Conservative&quot; or &quot;Independent Liberal&quot; on a ballot paper, as the 1998 Act prohibits any description which could cause confusion with a registered political party. In practice, the description used is either the name of a registered party or the word &quot;Independent&quot;.

The legislation therefore introduced a register of political parties and included provisions to prohibit &quot;confusion&quot; with already-existing parties, names that were more than six words, or were &quot;obscene or offensive&quot;.

As the act also permitted logos on ballot papers, the act also introduced a similar register for emblems, which had the result that the Communist Party of Britain is the only party in the United Kingdom permitted to use the hammer and sickle as its ballot-paper logo, although they usually use the hammer and dove variant. Parties may register more than one emblem, or none at all; most have two or three.

The act was amended by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (2000 c. 41) to change the registration authority to the Electoral Commission from &quot;the registrar or other officer who performs the duty of registration of companies in England and Wales under the Companies Act 1985&quot;.

<text>A gene family is a set of several similar genes, formed by duplication of a single original gene, and generally with similar biochemical functions. One such family are the genes for human hemoglobin subunits; the ten genes are in two clusters on different chromosomes, called the α-globin and β-globin loci. These two gene clusters are thought to have arisen as a result of a precursor gene being duplicated approximately 500 million years ago.

Genes are categorized into families based on shared nucleotide or protein sequences. Phylogenetic techniques can be used as a more rigorous test. The positions of exons within the coding sequence can be used to infer common ancestry. Knowing the sequence of the protein encoded by a gene can allow researchers to apply methods that find similarities among protein sequences that provide more information than similarities or differences among DNA sequences.

If the genes of a gene family encode proteins, the term &quot;protein family&quot; is often used in an analogous manner to &quot;gene family&quot;.

The expansion or contraction of gene families along a specific lineage can be due to chance, or can be the result of 
natural selection. To distinguish between these two cases is often difficult in practice. Recent work uses a combination
of statistical models and algorithmic techniques to detect gene families that are under the effect of natural selection.

The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) creates nomenclature schemes using a &quot;stem&quot; (or &quot;root&quot;) symbol for members of a gene family (by homology &quot;or&quot; function), with a hierarchical numbering system to distinguish the individual members. For example, for the peroxiredoxin family, &quot;PRDX&quot; is the root symbol, and the family members are &quot;PRDX1&quot;, &quot;PRDX2&quot;, &quot;PRDX3&quot;, &quot;PRDX4&quot;, &quot;PRDX5&quot;, and &quot;PRDX6&quot;.

==Basic structure==
One level of genome organization is the grouping of genes into several gene families. Gene families are groups of related genes that share a common ancestor. Members of gene families may be paralogs or orthologs. Gene paralogs are genes with similar sequences from within the same species while gene orthologs are genes with similar sequences in different species. Gene families are highly variable in size, sequence diversity, and arrangement. Depending on the diversity and functions of the genes within the family, families can be classified as multigene families or superfamilies.

Multigene families typically consist of members with similar sequences and functions, though a high degree of divergence (at the sequence and/or functional level) does not lead to the removal of a gene from a gene family. Individual genes in the family may be arranged close together on the same chromosome or dispersed throughout the genome on different chromosomes. Due to the similarity of their sequences and their overlapping functions, individual genes in the family often share regulatory control elements. In some instances, gene members have identical (or nearly identical) sequences. Such families allow for massive amounts of gene product to be expressed in a short time as needed. Other families allow for similar but specific products to be expressed in different cell types or at different stages of an organism&#x27;s development.

Superfamilies are much larger than single multigene families. Superfamilies contain up to hundreds of genes, including multiple multigene families as well as single, individual gene members. The large number of members allows superfamilies to be widely dispersed with some genes clustered and some spread far apart. The genes are diverse in sequence and function displaying various levels of expression and separate regulation controls.

Some gene families also contain pseudogenes, sequences of DNA that closely resemble established gene sequences but are non-functional. Different types of pseudogenes exist. Non-processed pseudogenes are genes that acquired mutations over time becoming non-functional. Processed pseudogenes are genes that have lost their function after being moved around the genome by retrotransposition. Pseudogenes that have become isolated from the gene family they originated in, are referred to as &quot;orphans&quot;.

==Formation==

Gene families arose from multiple duplications of an ancestral gene, followed by mutation and divergence. Duplications can occur within a lineage (e.g., humans might have two copies of a gene that is found only once in chimpanzees) or they are the result of speciation. For example, a single gene in the ancestor of humans and chimpanzees now occurs in both species and can be thought of as having been &#x27;duplicated&#x27; via speciation. As a result of duplication by speciation, a gene family might include 15 genes, one copy in each of 15 different species.

===Duplication===

In the formation of gene families, four levels of duplication exist: 1) exon duplication and shuffling, 2) entire gene duplication, 3) multigene family duplication, and 4) whole genome duplication. Exon duplication and shuffling gives rise to variation and new genes. Genes are then duplicated to form multigene families which duplicate to form superfamilies spanning multiple chromosomes. Whole genome duplication doubles the number of copies of every gene and gene family. Whole genome duplication or polyploidization can be either autopolyploidization or alloploidization. Autopolyploidization is the duplication of the same genome and allopolyploidization is the duplication of two closely related genomes or hybridized genomes from different species.

Duplication occurs primarily through uneven crossing over events in meiosis of germ cells. (1,2) When two chromosomes misalign, crossing over - the exchange of gene alleles - results in one chromosome expanding or increasing in gene number and the other contracting or decreasing in gene number. The expansion of a gene cluster is the duplication of genes that leads to larger gene families.

===Relocation===
Gene members of a multigene family or multigene families within superfamilies exist on different chromosomes due to relocation of those genes after duplication of the ancestral gene. Transposable elements play a role in the movement of genes. Transposable elements are recognized by inverted repeats at their 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; ends. When two transposable elements are close enough in the same region on a chromosome, they can form a composite transposon. The protein transposase recognizes the outermost inverted repeats, cutting the DNA segment. Any genes between the two transposable elements are relocated as the composite transposon jumps to a new area of the genome.

Reverse transcription is another method of gene movement. An mRNA transcript of a gene is reversed transcribed, or copied, back into DNA. This new DNA copy of the mRNA is integrated into another part of the genome, resulting in gene family members being dispersed.

A special type of multigene family is implicated in the movement of gene families and gene family members. LINE (Long INterspersed Elements) and SINE (Short INterspersed Elements) families are highly repetitive DNA sequences spread all throughout the genome. The LINEs contain a sequence that encodes a reverse transcriptase protein. This protein aids in copying the RNA transcripts of LINEs and SINEs back into DNA, and integrates them into different areas of the genome. This self-perpetuates the growth of LINE and SINE families. Due to the highly repetitive nature of these elements, LINEs and SINEs when close together also trigger unequal crossing over events which result in single-gene duplications and the formation of gene families.

===Divergence===

Non-synonymous mutations resulting in the substitution of amino acids, increase in duplicate gene copies. Duplication gives rise to multiple copies of the same gene, giving a level of redundancy where mutations are tolerated. With one functioning copy of the gene, other copies are able to acquire mutations without being extremely detrimental to the organisms. Mutations allow duplicate genes to acquire new or different functions.

===Concerted evolution===

Some multigene families are extremely homogenous, with individual genes members sharing identical or almost identical sequences. The process by which gene families maintain high homogeneity is Concerted evolution. Concerted evolution occurs through repeated cycles of unequal crossing over events and repeated cycles of gene transfer and conversion. Unequal crossing over leads to the expansion and contraction of gene families. Gene families have an optimal size range that natural selection acts towards. Contraction deletes divergent gene copies and keeps gene families from becoming too large. Expansion replaces lost gene copies and prevents gene families from becoming too small. Repeat cycles of gene transfer and conversion increasingly make gene family members more similar.

In the process of gene transfer, allelic gene conversion is biased. Mutant alleles spreading in a gene family towards homogeneity is the same process of an advantageous allele spreading in a population towards fixation. Gene conversion also aids in creating genetic variation in some cases.

==Evolution==

Gene families, part of a hierarchy of information storage in a genome, play a large role in the evolution and diversity of multicellular organisms. Gene families are large units of information and genetic variability. Over evolutionary time, gene families have expanded and contracted with genes within a family duplicating and diversifying into new genes, and genes being lost. An entire gene family may also be lost, or gained through de novo gene birth, by such extensive divergence such that a gene is considered part of a new family, or by horizontal gene transfer. When the number of genes per genome remains relatively constant, this implies that genes are gained and lost at relatively same rates. There are some patterns in which genes are more likely to be lost vs. which are more likely to duplicate and diversify into multiple copies.

An adaptive expansion of a single gene into many initially identical copies occurs when natural selection would favour additional gene copies. This is the case when an environmental stressor acts on a species. Gene amplification is more common in bacteria and is a reversible process. Contraction of gene families commonly results from accumulation of loss of function mutations. A nonsense mutation which prematurely halts gene transcription becomes fixed in the population, leading to the loss of genes. This process occurs when changes in the environment render a gene redundant.

== Functional family ==
In addition to classification by evolution (structural gene family), the HGNC also makes &quot;gene families&quot; by function in their stem nomenclature. As a result, a stem can also refer to genes that have the same function, often part of the same protein complex. For example, &quot;BRCA1&quot; and &quot;BRCA2&quot; are unrelated genes that are both named for their role in breast cancer and &quot;RPS2&quot; and &quot;RPS3&quot; are unrelated ribosomal proteins found in the same small subunit.

The HGNC also maintains a &quot;gene group&quot; (formerly &quot;gene family&quot;) classification. A gene can be a member of multiple groups, and all groups form a hierarchy. As with the stem classification, both structural and functional groups exist.

<doc id="526721" wikidata="Q222606" url="?curid=526721" title="Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien">
<text>Louis Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Enghien (&quot;duc d&#x27;Enghien&quot; pronounced ) (Louis Antoine Henri; 2 August 1772 – 21 March 1804) was a member of the House of Bourbon of France. More famous for his death than his life, he was executed by order of Napoleon Bonaparte, who brought charges against him of aiding Britain and plotting against Napoleon.

==Biography==
The Duke of Enghien was the only son of Louis Henri de Bourbon and Bathilde d&#x27;Orléans. As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, he was a prince du sang. He was born at the Château de Chantilly, the country residence of the Princes of Condé – a title he was born to inherit. He was given the title &quot;duc d&#x27;Enghien&quot; from birth, his father already being the Duke of Bourbon and the heir of the Prince of Condé, the Duke of Bourbon being the Heir apparent of Condé.

His mother&#x27;s full name was Louise Marie Thérèse &quot;Bathilde&quot; d&#x27;Orléans; she was the only surviving daughter of Louis Philippe d&#x27;Orléans (grandson of the Regent &quot;Philippe d&#x27;Orléans&quot;) and Louise Henriette de Bourbon. His uncle was the future Philippe Égalité and he was thus a first cousin of the future Louis-Philippe I, King of the French. He was also doubly descended from Louis XIV through his legitimated daughters, &quot;Mademoiselle de Blois&quot; and &quot;Mademoiselle de Nantes&quot;.

He was an only child, his parents separating in 1778 after his father&#x27;s romantic involvement with one Marguerite Catherine Michelot, a Paris Opera singer, was discovered; it was his mother who was blamed for her husband&#x27;s infidelity. Michelot was the mother of Enghien&#x27;s two illegitimate sisters.

He was educated privately by the Abbé Millot, and in military matters by Commodore de Vinieux. He early on showed the warlike spirit of the House of Condé, and began his military career in 1788. At the outbreak of the French Revolution, he emigrated with his father and grandfather a few days after the Storming of the Bastille, and in exile he would seek to raise forces for the invasion of France and restoration of the monarchy to its pre-revolutionary status.

In 1792, at the outbreak of French Revolutionary Wars, he held a command in the corps of émigrés organized and commanded by his grandfather, the Prince of Condé. This &quot;Army of Condé&quot; shared in the Duke of Brunswick&#x27;s unsuccessful invasion of France.
After this, the young duke continued to serve under his father and grandfather in the Condé army, and, on several occasions, distinguished himself by his bravery and ardour in the vanguard. On the dissolution of that force after the peace of Lunéville (February 1801), he privately married Princess Charlotte de Rohan, niece of the Cardinal de Rohan, and took up his residence at Ettenheim in Baden, near the Rhine.

===Seizure, trial and death===
Early in 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte, then First Consul of France, heard news which seemed to connect the young duke with the Cadoudal Affair, a conspiracy which was being tracked by the French police at the time. It involved royalists Jean-Charles Pichegru and Georges Cadoudal who wished to overthrow Bonaparte&#x27;s regime and reinstate the monarchy. The news ran that the duke was in company with Charles François Dumouriez and had made secret journeys into France. This was false; there is no evidence that the duke had dealings with either Cadoudal or Pichegru. However, the duke had previously been condemned in absentia for having fought against the French Republic in the &quot;Armée des Émigrés&quot;. Napoleon gave orders for the seizure of the duke.

French dragoons crossed the Rhine secretly, surrounded his house and brought him to Strasbourg (15 March 1804), and thence to the Château de Vincennes, near Paris, where a military commission of French colonels presided over by General Pierre-Augustin Hulin was hastily convened to try him. The duke was charged chiefly with bearing arms against France in the late war, and with intending to take part in the new coalition then proposed against France.

The military commission, presided over by Hulin, drew up the act of condemnation, being incited thereto by orders from Anne Jean Marie René Savary, who had come charged with instructions to kill the duke. Savary prevented any chance of an interview between the condemned and the First Consul, and, on 21 March, the duke was shot in the moat of the castle, near a grave which had already been prepared. A platoon of the Gendarmes d&#x27;élite was in charge of the execution. His last words were &quot;I must die then at the hands of Frenchmen!&quot;

In 1816, his remains were exhumed and placed in the Holy Chapel of the Château de Vincennes.

====Impact of death====
Royalty across Europe were shocked and dismayed at the duke&#x27;s death. Tsar Alexander I of Russia was especially alarmed, and decided to curb Napoleon&#x27;s power. &quot;Baden was the territory of the tsar&#x27;s father-in-law, and the German principalities were part of the Holy Roman Empire of which Russia was a guarantor.&quot;

Enghien was the last descendant of the House of Condé; his grandfather and father survived him, but died without producing further heirs. It is now known that Joséphine and Madame de Rémusat had begged Bonaparte to spare the duke, but nothing would bend his will. Whether Talleyrand, Fouché or Savary bore responsibility for the seizure of the duke is debatable, as at times Napoleon was known to claim Talleyrand conceived the idea, while at other times he took full responsibility himself. On his way to St. Helena and at Longwood, Napoleon asserted that, in the same circumstances, he would do the same again; he inserted a similar declaration in his will, stating that &quot;[I]t was necessary for the safety, interest, and the honour of the French people when the Comte d&#x27;Artois, by his own confession, was supporting sixty assassins at Paris.&quot;

The execution shocked the aristocracy of Europe, who still remembered the bloodletting of the Revolution. Either Antoine Boulay, comte de la Meurthe (deputy from Meurthe in the Corps législatif) or Napoleon&#x27;s chief of police, Fouché, said about his execution &quot;C&#x27;est pire qu&#x27;un crime, c&#x27;est une faute&quot;, a statement often rendered in English as &quot;It was worse than a crime; it was a blunder.&quot; The statement is also sometimes attributed to Talleyrand. In the 1844 essay, &quot;Experience&quot;, Emerson misattributes the line to Napoleon himself.

In contrast, in France the execution appeared to quiet domestic resistance to Napoleon, who soon set up a military dictatorship by crowning himself Emperor of the French. Cadoudal, dismayed at the news of Napoleon&#x27;s proclamation, reputedly exclaimed, &quot;We wanted to make a king, but we made an emperor&quot;.

==Cultural references==

===Tolstoy===
The killing of d&#x27;Enghien is discussed in the opening book of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;. The vicomte de Mortemart, a French émigré who supposedly knew the duke personally, is the focus of attention of the Russian aristocrats gathered at Anna Pavlovna Sherer&#x27;s home:

The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the duc d&#x27;Enghien. &quot;After the murder of the Duc, even the most partial ceased to regard [Buonaparte] as a hero. If to some people he ever was a hero, after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earth.&quot; The vicomte said that the duc d&#x27;Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular reasons for Buonaparte&#x27;s hatred of him.(...)

It was an anecdote, then current, to the effect that the duc d&#x27;Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress&#x27; favors, and that in his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject, and was thus at the Duc&#x27;s mercy. The latter spared him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death. The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked agitated.

The actress Marguerite-Joséphine Wiemer, known as &quot;Mademoiselle George&quot;, was indeed Napoleon&#x27;s mistress, but there is no evidence that Enghien had anything to do with her, or that the story preserved to posterity by Tolstoy&#x27;s masterpiece was anything more than one of the pieces of gossip and conspiracy theories current around Europe at the time.

===Dumas===
The killing is treated in &quot;The Last Cavalier&quot; by Alexandre Dumas. For example:

[T]he dominant sentiment in Bonaparte&#x27;s mind at that moment was neither fear nor vengeance, but rather the desire for all of France to realise that Bourbon blood, so sacred to Royalist partisans, was no more sacred to him than the blood of any other citizen in the Republic. 

&quot;Well, then&quot;, asked Cambacérès, &quot;what have you decided?&quot;

&quot;It&#x27;s simple&quot;, said Bonaparte. &quot;We shall kidnap the Duc d&#x27;Enghien and be done with it.&quot;His death was also briefly mentioned in &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;:

&#x27;There wasn&#x27;t any trouble over treaties when it was a question of shooting the poor Duc d&#x27;Enghien&#x27; &quot;

===Film===
&quot;La mort du duc d&#x27;Enghien en 1804&quot; (1909) was a one-reel silent film directed by Albert Capellani.

<text>Marquess of Cambridge was a title that was created twice, once in the Peerage of England and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The first creation was for Prince George Augustus in 1706, when he was created Duke of Cambridge, Marquess of Cambridge, Earl of Milford Haven, Viscount Northallerton and Baron of Tewkesbury. He succeeded to the Dukedoms of Cornwall and Rothesay on his father&#x27;s accession to the throne on 1 August 1714. His titles merged with the Crown when he succeeded to the throne as King George II in 1727.

The second creation (along with the subsidiary titles Earl of Eltham and Viscount Northallerton) was in 1917 for Adolphus, Duke of Teck, brother of Queen Mary and brother-in-law of King George V, when he gave up his German titles and took the surname &quot;Cambridge&quot;. Adolphus Cambridge was a grandson of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge through his daughter Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge.

Upon the death of the second Marquess without any male heirs, the marquessate became extinct.

==Marquess of Cambridge (1706-1727)==
*Prince George Augustus, Duke of Cambridge (1683-1760), Succeeded to the throne in 1727 as King George II

&quot;For further details see Duke of Cambridge&quot;

==Marquesses of Cambridge (1917–1981)==
*Adolphus Charles Alexander Albert Edward George Philip Louis Ladislaus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge (1868–1927), grandson of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, was created Marquess when George V relinquished his family&#x27;s German titles
*George Francis Hugh Cambridge, 2nd Marquess of Cambridge (1895–1981), only son of the 1st Marquess, died without male issue and his honours became extinct

<text>John David Marks (November 10, 1909 – September 3, 1985) was an American songwriter. He specialized in Christmas songs and wrote many holiday standards, including &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; (a hit for Gene Autry and others), &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; (a hit for Brenda Lee), &quot;A Holly Jolly Christmas&quot; (recorded by the Quinto Sisters and later by Burl Ives), &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; (for Burl Ives), and &quot;I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day&quot; (introduced by Bing Crosby).

==Personal life==
Marks was born to a Jewish family in Mount Vernon, New York. He began writing songs when he was 13. A graduate of McBurney School in New York, N.Y., Colgate University, and Columbia University, Marks later studied in Paris. He earned a Bronze Star and four Battle Stars as an Army Captain in the 26th Special Service Company during World War II. Marks had three children: Michael, Laura, and David. Marks was the great-uncle of economist Steven Levitt.

Marks&#x27; father, Louis B. Marks (1869-1939), was a leading illumination (lighting) engineer. His wife, Margaret May Marks, was the sister of Robert L. May, who wrote the original story of Rudolph. Marks was the nephew of Marcus M. Marks, a business figure who served as Borough President of Manhattan.

Marks lived on West 11th Street in Greenwich Village and is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. He died on September 3, 1985, of complications from diabetes.

==Career==
Among Marks&#x27;s many works is &quot;Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, which was based on a poem of the same name by Marks&#x27;s brother-in-law, Robert L. May, Rudolph&#x27;s creator. A television film based on the story and song first aired in 1964, with Marks composing the score. He felt pigeonholed by the success of the song; he felt that his best song was &quot;I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day“, which set the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 1864 poem &quot;Christmas Bells&quot; to music. 

In addition to his songwriting, Marks founded St. Nicholas Music in 1949, and served as director of ASCAP from 1957 to 1961. In 1981, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Marks appeared as an imposter on the December 11, 1961, episode of the game show &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot;. Impersonating the owner of a herd of reindeer, he received two of the four votes. After the true contestant was revealed, Marks identified himself as the composer of &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;.

<text>Aubrey Lewis Huff III (born December 20, 1976) is an American former professional baseball player who played 13 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). Huff played for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Houston Astros, Baltimore Orioles, Detroit Tigers, and San Francisco Giants; he was a member of two World Series championship teams for the Giants. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed.

Huff attended Vernon College and the University of Miami, where he finished his career second in school batting average. He was drafted by the Devil Rays in the sixth round in 1998, and debuted with them in 2000. In 2002, he finished tenth in the American League (AL) in batting average. He set a career high in 2003 with 34 home runs and batted .311 with 107 runs batted in (RBI), while tying for the lead in errors among AL right fielders with six. Next season, he batted .297 with 24 home runs and 104 RBI. In 2005, he batted .261 with 22 home runs and 92 RBI. During the 2006 season, he was traded to the Astros.

In 2007, Huff signed a three-year contract with the Orioles. He hit 15 home runs his first season with the Orioles, his lowest total since 2001. In 2008, he won the Silver Slugger Award for the designated hitter position after batting .304 with 32 home runs and a career-high 108 RBI. During the 2009 season, he was traded to the Tigers. He became a free agent after the season and signed a one-year deal with the Giants. He batted .290 with 26 home runs in 2010, reached the playoffs for the first time, and won his first World Series. He signed a two-year deal with the Giants in 2011, and batted .246 and hit 12 home runs, his lowest total since 2001. In 2012, he batted .192, was used mostly as a pinch hitter, and appeared in a career-low 52 games but won his second World Series with the Giants. The team paid a $2 million buyout to release him.

In January 2014, Huff announced his retirement from baseball, and took a position as a baseball color commentator for eight months.

==Early life==
Huff was born in Marion, Ohio, and grew up in Mineral Wells, Texas. In 1983, when he was six years old, his father, Aubrey II, was shot and killed as an innocent bystander in a domestic dispute while working as an electrician. When his mother told him that his father had been killed, Huff later wrote: &quot;I went back to watching &quot;The Transformers&quot; on television. I remember thinking, ‘He was never here anyway.’&quot; Huff&#x27;s mother Fonda then raised him and his sister Angela.

Growing up, Huff regularly practiced baseball in his yard, which had a batting cage with lights and a pitching machine. He said, &quot;[My mother bought] it more to keep me out of trouble.&quot; He grew up rooting for the Texas Rangers, and frequently attended their games. One of his favorite players was Nolan Ryan. Huff initially attended Mineral Wells High School, but transferred to Brewer High School when his family moved to Fort Worth. While he was selected to the All-District baseball team in high school, he was better known as a basketball player. He graduated in 1995.

==College career==
Huff attended Vernon College for two years and was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of its baseball team in 1996. He transferred to the University of Miami for his final two years of college baseball. As a junior, he tied team single-game records for runs in a game (five against Harvard University on March 28) and most doubles in a game (four on May 16 against Georgia Tech).

As a senior, Huff hit for a .412 batting average, the fourth highest single-season average in school history. His .768 slugging percentage was the second highest in school history. He also hit 21 home runs (fifth in school history) and a school record of 95 runs batted in (RBI). &quot;Baseball America&quot;, &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, and the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association named him a first-team All-American.

Huff finished his UM college career with a .400 batting average (second in school history) and a .719 slugging percentage (third in school history). In 2009, he was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
Huff was the Tampa Bay Devil Rays&#x27; fifth-round selection (162nd overall) in the 1998 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft. He spent 1998 with the Charleston RiverDogs of the single-A South Atlantic League, where he batted .321 with 85 hits, 19 doubles, 13 home runs, and 54 RBI in 69 games.

In 1999, Huff played for the Orlando Rays of the Double-A Southern League and was named a Southern League postseason All-Star. In 133 games with the Rays (tied with three players for fourth in the league behind Brady Clark&#x27;s 138, Brent Abernathy&#x27;s 136, and Kurt Airoso&#x27;s 134), Huff batted .301 (eighth) with 148 hits (fourth, behind Abernathy&#x27;s 168, Clark&#x27;s 165, and Tim Giles&#x27;s 157), 40 doubles (third, behind Scott Vieira&#x27;s 44 and Abernathy&#x27;s 42), 22 home runs (tied with John Curl for second behind Javier Cardona&#x27;s 26), and 78 RBI (tied with Bry Nelson for ninth in the league).

Huff began 2000 with the Durham Bulls of the Triple-A International League. In 108 games, he batted .316 (fifth) with 129 hits, 36 doubles (fourth, behind Clark&#x27;s 41, Ryan Jackson&#x27;s 38, and José Fernández&#x27;s 37), 20 home runs, and 76 RBI. He was named the International League Rookie of the Year and was named to the postseason All-Star team.

===Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2000–2006)===
====2000====
Huff was called up by the Devil Rays at the beginning of August to be the starting third baseman after Vinny Castilla suffered an injury. He had an RBI in his debut on August 2, a 5–3 loss to the Cleveland Indians. Two days later, he got his first career hit against José Mercedes in a 10–9 loss to the Baltimore Orioles. On August 10, he had a season-high three RBI by hitting his first career home run, a game-winning three-run hit against Jason Ryan in a 10–4 victory over the Minnesota Twins. In 39 games, Huff hit .287 with 35 hits, seven doubles, four home runs, and 14 RBI.

====2001====
Huff began the 2001 season with Durham, but was called up on April 13 when Ariel Prieto was sent to the minors. He became the starting third baseman on May 11 when Castilla was released. Huff was moved from third base to first base on August 6 following an injury to Steve Cox. After batting .243 with six home runs and 33 RBI in his first 92 games, he was optioned to Durham on August 23 when Cox came off the disabled list (DL). In September, he was called up to replace Greg Vaughn as the Devil Rays&#x27; designated hitter (DH). On September 19, he had three hits and five RBI, including a game-winning single against David Cone, in a 12–2 victory over the Boston Red Sox. He finished the season batting .248 with 102 hits, 25 doubles, eight home runs, and 45 RBI in 111 games. In 17 games at Durham, he batted .288 with 19 hits, six doubles, three home runs, and 10 RBI.

====2002====
Huff missed the first month of 2002 with a broken cheekbone and began the season in the minor leagues before getting called up on May 28 to replace the struggling Jason Tyner on the roster. He started for the rest of the season as a first baseman, a third baseman, or a DH. On July 19, he had four hits, including a home run against Esteban Loaiza, and three RBI in an 11–8 loss to the Blue Jays. He had a 17-game hitting streak from August 23 to September 10, the second-longest streak in franchise history at the time (behind Quinton McCracken&#x27;s 18-game streak in 1998). In 113 games, Huff finished tenth in the American League (AL) with a .313 batting average and had 142 hits, 25 doubles, 23 home runs, and 59 RBI. He led the Devil Rays in home runs, marking the first time a player led his team in home runs after starting the season in the minors since 1996, when Tony Clark led the Detroit Tigers. In 32 games with Durham, he batted .325 with 41 hits, nine doubles, three home runs, and 20 RBI.

====2003====
On April 26, 2003, Huff had four hits in a 10–7 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. After playing mostly first and third base in April, he took over from George Lombard as the Devil Rays&#x27; right fielder for the remainder of the season on April 29. On May 3, he had the first multi-homer game of his career by hitting two two-run home runs against Adam Bernero in an 8–6 victory over the Tigers. He had four hits on June 4 in a 5–2 victory over the Chicago Cubs. On September 6, he stole home plate in a 7–4 victory over the Oakland Athletics. On September 23, he had four hits and hit a home run against Josh Towers in an 8–5 loss to the Blue Jays.

In 162 games (tied for second in the AL with Miguel Tejada behind Hideki Matsui&#x27;s 163), he batted .311 (ninth) with 47 doubles (third behind Garret Anderson&#x27;s and Vernon Wells&#x27;s 49), 34 home runs (ninth), and 107 RBI (tied for eighth with Jason Giambi). Huff&#x27;s single-season totals in hits, doubles, home runs, and RBI had been matched by 11 players in major league history as of 2012. He was tied for 24th in AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting along with Esteban Loaiza and Jason Varitek. Defensively, he tied with Tim Salmon for the lead in errors by AL right fielders with six.

====2004====
In 2004, Huff spent most of the season playing third base. On May 12, he had five RBI, including a three-run home run against Chan Ho Park, in a 9–8 loss against the Texas Rangers. He saw a streak of 398 consecutive games played snapped on August 22 when he was forced to miss a few games with a minor back injury. On August 27, he had four hits in an 8–7 loss to the Athletics. He would have four hits again on September 23 in a 7–3 loss to the Yankees.

Huff finished the season batting .297 with 178 hits, 27 doubles, 29 home runs, and 104 RBI in 157 games. His average, home runs, and RBI were the highest totals among Devil Rays&#x27; players.

====2005====
In 2005, Huff spent most of the year in right field. On April 18, Huff had four RBI and hit the 100th home run of his career, a three-run shot against Jaret Wright in a 19–8 loss to the Yankees. After hitting five home runs in the first three months, Huff hit 17 home runs through the rest of the season. On July 22, he hit the first grand slam of his career, a game-winning home run against Bruce Chen in a 7–5 victory over the Orioles. He was named the AL Player of the Week from July 25 to 31 after he batted .409 with two home runs and 10 RBI. In 148 games, Huff batted .261 with 150 hits, 26 doubles, 22 home runs, and 92 RBI.

====2006====
For 2006, Huff was moved back to third base. He was placed on the disabled list for the first time in his career on April 12 with a sprained left knee suffered in a collision with Nick Green the day before. On May 4, he was activated from the DL. On May 19, he hit his first career walk-off home run against Yusmeiro Petit in a 10-inning, 5–4 win over the Marlins. Through July 9, Huff batted .283 with 65 hits, 15 doubles, eight home runs, and 28 RBI in 63 games.

Huff ranked among the top ten in several career and single-season records in the history of the Tampa Bay Rays (Devil Rays from 1998 to 2007) as of 2019. Through 2019, he ranked fifth in games played (799), at bats (3,028), plate appearances (3,322), hits (870), doubles (172), RBI (449), and batting average (.287). His 128 home runs ranked third (behind Carlos Peña&#x27;s 163, and Evan Longoria&#x27;s 261), and his 400 runs scored ranked sixth. He, Longoria and Delmon Young were the only Devil Rays to appear in 162 games in a season. He held Devil Rays&#x27; record for hits in a season and doubles in a season, both set in 2003. His batting averages in 2002 and 2003 ranked sixth and seventh, respectively; his home run total in 2003 tied for fifth; and his RBI totals in 2003 and 2004 were fourth and tied for sixth, respectively.

===Houston Astros (2006)===
On July 12, 2006, the Houston Astros acquired Huff from Tampa Bay for minor leaguers Mitch Talbot and Ben Zobrist. Huff was used at third base for the Astros until August 1, when he was moved to right field following regular third baseman Morgan Ensberg&#x27;s return from the DL. In his debut with the Astros on July 13, the first game after the All-Star break, Huff had two hits, including a three-run home run against Randy Messenger in a 5–1 victory over the Marlins. On August 9, he had three hits, two home runs, and six RBI in a 14–1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 68 games with Houston, Huff batted .250 with 56 hits, 10 doubles, 13 home runs, and 38 RBI. He combined to bat .267 with 121 hits, 25 doubles, 21 home runs, and 66 RBI in 131 games in 2006. On October 31, he filed for free agency.

===Baltimore Orioles (2007–2009)===
====2007====
On January 3, 2007, Huff officially signed a three-year, $20 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles. He began the year getting most of the starts at first base, but in mid-May he became the Orioles regular DH as Kevin Millar was moved to first base. In a 9–7 loss to the Angels on June 29, he hit for the cycle and got his 1,000th hit and 200th double (both against Kelvim Escobar). He was one of four Orioles to hit for the cycle (along with Brooks Robinson, Cal Ripken Jr., and Félix Pie) and the first player to do so at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. On August 14, Huff had two hits and five RBI, including a grand slam against Jeff Karstens in a 12–0 victory over the Yankees. In 151 games, Huff batted .280 with 154 hits, 34 doubles, 15 home runs, and 72 RBI.

====2008====
Before the 2008 season, Huff switched his uniform number from 19 to 17 in honor of his former teammate Joe Kennedy, who died during the offseason. He angered fans in the offseason when he called Baltimore a &quot;horse----&quot; town when compared to Tampa, but he regained fan support by the end of the year by posting one of his best seasons. He was the Orioles&#x27; designated hitter for most of the season, although he was moved to third base at the end of August following an injury to Melvin Mora. On April 8, he had four hits and four RBI in an 8–1 victory over the Rangers. He was named AL Player of the Week from June 30 to July 6 after hitting .345 with three home runs and nine RBIs. He was named the Player of the Week again from August 25–31 after batting .478 with two home runs and seven RBI. In 154 games, Huff batted .304 with 182 hits (tied with Nick Markakis for 10th in the league), 48 doubles (tied with Markakis for third in the league behind Dustin Pedroia&#x27;s 54 and Brian Roberts&#x27;s 51), 33 home runs (tied for eighth with Jason Giambi and Josh Hamilton), and 108 RBI (sixth). He also led the American League with 82 extra-base hits. He finished 16th in AL MVP voting and was named &quot;Most Valuable Oriole&quot; by Baltimore sportswriters. He won the Silver Slugger Award for DH and the Edgar Martínez Award, becoming the first Oriole to win the award since Tommy Davis in 1974.

====2009====
Huff moved to first base in 2009 following the departure of Millar. Through August 17, Huff batted .253 with 109 hits, 24 doubles, 13 home runs, and 72 RBI in 110 games.

===Detroit Tigers (2009)===

On August 17, 2009, Huff cleared waivers and was traded to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for pitching prospect Brett Jacobson. He began his time with the Tigers as the team&#x27;s DH, but in September he only played against right-handed pitchers as Marcus Thames began playing against left-handed pitchers. He hit his first career pinch-hit home run against Jason Frasor on September 14, a game-tying three-run hit in a 10-inning, 6–5 victory over Toronto.

In 40 games with the Tigers, Huff batted .189/.265/.302 with 20 hits, six doubles, two home runs, and 13 RBI. His season totals were a .241 batting average, 129 hits, 30 doubles, 15 home runs, and 85 RBI in 150 games. Following the season, Huff filed for free agency.

===San Francisco Giants (2010–2012)===
====2010====

On January 13, 2010, Huff signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the San Francisco Giants. He spent most of the season playing first base for the Giants, although he played left field and right field when Buster Posey played first base from May 29 – June 30 and Travis Ishikawa made most of the starts at first base from July 3 – August 14. On April 14, Huff hit his first career inside-the-park home run (his first home run with the Giants), a game-winning hit against Charlie Morton in a 6–0 victory over the Pirates. On August 28, he got his 1,500th career hit against Alex Sanabia in a 10-inning, 10–9 victory over the Marlins. In 157 games, Huff batted .290 with 165 hits, 35 doubles, 26 home runs, and 86 RBI while scoring 100 runs (tied for seventh in the league with Brandon Phillips, Martín Prado, and Dan Uggla) for the first time in his career. Huff finished seventh in the voting for the NL MVP award.

Huff, in the 11th year of his career, reached the playoffs for the first time as the Giants won the NL West. In Game 4 of the NL Division Series (NLDS) against the Atlanta Braves, he had a ninth-inning, two-out, game-tying RBI single against Mike Dunn in a 3–2 Giants&#x27; victory. He batted .267 with four hits and one RBI in the series as the Giants defeated the Braves in four games. He batted .250 with six hits and three RBI in the series as the Giants defeated the Phillies in six games. In Game 4 of the World Series against the Texas Rangers on October 31, he hit a game-winning two-run home run against Tommy Hunter in a 4–0 Giants&#x27; victory. He batted .294 with five hits, a home run, and four RBI in the series, winning his first World Series as the Giants defeated the Rangers in five games to win their first World Series in 56 years.

====2011====

Huff filed for free agency after the 2010 season, but on November 23, 2010, he re-signed with the Giants on a two-year, $22 million contract with a club option for 2013. Coming off the team&#x27;s 2010 World Series success and his new contract, Huff arrived at 2011 spring training out of shape. He began 2011 in right field due to an injury to Cody Ross, but he returned to first base when Ross was activated from the disabled list on April 20. He drew a pinch-hit, game-winning, bases loaded walk on April 30 against John Lannan in a 2–1 victory over the Washington Nationals. On June 2, his wife&#x27;s birthday, Huff hit three home runs and drove in a career-high six runs in the Giants&#x27; 12–7 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. He said after the game, &quot;[My wife] wanted me to hit her a homer. I hit three. Brownie points.&quot; Those home runs accounted for a quarter of his season total, as his overall production dropped from the previous season.

For the season, he batted .246/.306/.370. Compared to 2010, his batting average dropped 44 points, his homers fell from 26 to 12, and his walks went from 83 to 47 as he grew impatient. His On-base plus slugging (OPS) dropped 215 points to .676, last among Major League first baseman in 2011. Giants&#x27; manager Bruce Bochy said, &quot;[Huff&#x27;s] struggles helped cause our struggles&quot;; the Giants failed to return to the playoffs in 2011.

====2012====
In 2012 spring training, Huff competed with Brandon Belt and Brett Pill for the Giants&#x27; first base job. Belt won the job, and Huff opened the season as the Giants&#x27; left fielder. On April 21, because the Giants did not have any infielders available, Huff was positioned at second base for the first time in his career in the ninth inning of a tied game against the Mets. He failed to cover second base in a potential double play situation, and the Mets went on to win the first game of the doubleheader 5–4. After the game, on April 25, Huff was placed on the 15-day disabled list with anxiety issues.

He returned from the disabled list on May 7, but was used mainly as a pinch hitter for the rest of the season. On June 15, he was placed on the DL with a sprained right knee that he suffered jumping over a dugout railing to celebrate Matt Cain&#x27;s perfect game. He returned from the DL on July 28 but was placed on it four days later with right knee tendinitis, which kept him out until August 31.

In 52 games, Huff batted .192/.326/.282 with 15 hits, four doubles, one home run, and seven RBI. In the playoffs, Huff was used exclusively as a pinch hitter. In 10 games, he had one hit in nine at-bats but won his second career World Series as the Giants swept the Tigers in four games. On November 1, Huff&#x27;s $10 million club option was declined, making him a free agent. He instead was paid a $2 million buyout.

Huff hit 242 career home runs, which as of May 16, 2022, ties him for 257th all-time with a number of players. In addition to being used as a designated hitter, he played at five different positions in his career: first base, third base, left field, right field, and second base.

==Post-playing career==

On January 4, 2014, Huff announced his retirement from baseball and took a position as a baseball color commentator for the Pac-12 Network. On March 31, 2014, Huff started co-hosting a morning radio show on Bay Area sports radio station 95.7 The Game with Chris Townsend and Ric Bucher titled &quot;Bucher, Towny and Huff&quot;. Huff left the show in August 2014.

Huff was an assistant baseball coach at Canyon Crest Academy in San Diego, California in 2015. In late 2015, Huff announced he was attempting a comeback three years after playing his final Major League game. In February 2017, he released a book, co-written by Stephen Cassar, entitled &quot;Baseball Junkie&quot;, in which he opens up about his &quot;battle with anxiety and the pressure of playing in the Major Leagues&quot;.

==Personal life==

On January 27, 2007, Huff married Barbara &quot;Baubi&quot; Heaton. The couple have two sons. During Huff&#x27;s playing days, they resided in Tampa, Florida, in the off-season. Baubi Huff filed for divorce on January 31, 2012. Although the couple briefly reconciled, they eventually divorced and Huff claimed that a woman could only marry him for money.

Huff has several tattoos. A &quot;Transformers&quot; fan, he has the logos of the Autobots and Decepticons tattooed on his shoulder blades. On his left shoulder, he also has a tattoo of a guitar with his father&#x27;s name under it in memory of his father.

Huff said he began taking Adderall in 2009, and was high on it &quot;every game, pretty much&quot; thereafter. He said: &quot;I was crushing 20, sometimes 50, 60, almost 100 milligrams daily&quot;. He said he was “high as a kite” during the team&#x27;s 2010 victory parade, as he struggled with the drug, which he views as a performance-enhancing drug. He said he then developed a dependency on alcohol to help him sleep, drinking 12–15 beers after games.

During the Giants&#x27; 2010 playoff race and postseason, Huff became known for wearing a red &quot;rally thong&quot;, which he joked would help the team win. When he was slumping in 2011, fans sent him thongs throughout the season in hopes of improving his performance.

In 2014, Huff says he contemplated suicide as he held a .357 Magnum to his head, with its hammer cocked, &quot;ready to pull the trigger&quot;.

===Politics===
Huff has supported the policies of current President Donald Trump, and has made controversial statements considered sexist, transphobic, and violent in nature. In November 2019, a comment Huff posted on Twitter went viral. He stated: &quot;Getting my boys trained up on how to use a gun in the unlikely event @BernieSanders beats @realDonaldTrump in 2020. In which case knowing how to effectively use a gun under socialism will be a must.&quot; The tweet was accompanied by a photo of a smiling Huff wearing a pro-Trump T-shirt at a shooting range, holding a used target with many bullet holes in it, and accompanied by two children (presumed to be his sons) whose faces were out of the frame of the picture.

In early January 2020, Huff was criticized after tweeting in response to a comment on the site which talked about invading Iran and kidnapping women from the country. He wrote: &quot;Let&#x27;s get a flight over and kidnap about 10 each. We can bring them back here as they fan us and feed us grapes, amongst other things.&quot; Huff later claimed the tweets were satirical, and continued to post similar tweets.

In mid-January 2020, when the Giants promoted Alyssa Nakken to be an assistant coach, making her the first full-time female assistant coach in the history of MLB, Huff tweeted: &quot;I got in trouble for wearing a thong in my own clubhouse when female reporters were present. Can&#x27;t imagine how it will play out with a full time female coach running around. This has #metoo &amp; #BelieveAllWomen written all over it. Only in ⁦@SFGiants.&quot; And then: &quot;Couldn&#x27;t imagine taking baseball instruction from an ex female softball player. Have fun with that @bcraw35 @bbelt9 @BusterPosey.&quot;

His behavior eventually prompted the Giants to ban Huff from a 2020 ceremony honoring their 2010 World Series championship. The team wrote that its reason was: &quot;Aubrey has made multiple comments on social media that are unacceptable and run counter to the values of our organization.&quot; Huff claimed that he was banned because of his support for President Trump saying &quot;If you look at my Twitter account, I&#x27;d say about 75 percent of my support [is for] President Trump. So, yeah, absolutely. I have every reason to believe in my heart of hearts it was all about President Trump.&quot;

In June 2020, Huff criticized people who wear masks to avoid spreading the COVID-19 virus, saying &quot;If you want to wear a mask and live in fear for the rest of your lives, that&#x27;s certainly your prerogative. But the vast majority of well-adjusted, sane, common sense people that aren&#x27;t sheep and can reason for themselves agree with me. I understand that coronavirus is real. If you have pre-existing conditions, or you&#x27;re an old person or—and this is going to sound insensitive, but someone has to say it—you&#x27;re morbidly obese, then stay the fuck home. Just because that is your plight in life, doesn&#x27;t mean the whole world has to shut down. If I God forbid get the coronavirus, here&#x27;s what I do: I go home, I get well and I get back and live my life. I would rather die from coronavirus than live the rest of my life in fear and wear a mask.&quot;

Huff has stated that he is not anti-vaccination, rather &quot;anti you telling me I need to get vaxxed.&quot; However, his other social media posts and his Twitter bio state that he is an anti-vaxxer.

On August 9, 2021, his Twitter account was permanently suspended, or banned, for what was called &quot;spreading COVID misinformation.&quot; On December 16, 2022, Huff&#x27;s Twitter account was reinstated.

In 2022, Huff ran for the school board in the Solana Beach school district and lost to his opponent, incumbent candidate Debra Schade, garnering just 17.5% of the vote to Schade&#x27;s 82.5%.

<text>A cross whose arms end in arrowheads is called a &quot;cross barby&quot; or &quot;cross barbée&quot; in the traditional terminology of heraldry. In Christian use, the ends of this cross resemble the barbs of fish hooks, or fish spears. 

In modern use, the symbol has become associated with extremist organisations after the Arrow Cross (&quot;Nyilaskereszt&quot;) symbol was used in Hungary in the 1930s and 1940s as the symbol of a far-right Hungarist fascist political party, the Arrow Cross Party, led by Ferenc Szálasi, and of this party&#x27;s thuggish paramilitary organization. The symbol consists of two green double-ended arrows in a cross configuration on a white circular background on a red background. The arrow cross symbol remains outlawed in Hungary.

A variant symbol, the Crosstar, is used by the Nationalist Movement, a white supremacist group based in the United States.

The arrow cross was previously used by the &quot;Falange Venezolana&quot; (Venezuelan Phalanx), a far-right group based in Venezuela.

<text>Jervis Bay () is a oceanic bay and village in the Jervis Bay Territory and on the South Coast of New South Wales, Australia. In the Dhurga language of the Aboriginal inhabitants of the area, it is called Booderee, which translates as &quot;bay of plenty&quot;.

A area of land around the southern headland of the bay is a territory of the Commonwealth of Australia, known as the Jervis Bay Territory, which is administered by, but is not a part of, the Australian Capital Territory. The Territory includes the settlements of Jervis Bay Village and Wreck Bay Village. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) base, , is in the Jervis Bay Territory between Jervis Bay Village and Greenpatch Point.

==History==
Archaeological finds at Burrill Lake, 55 kilometres south of Jervis Bay, provide evidence of Aboriginal occupation dating back 20,000 years.

Jervis Bay was sighted by Lieutenant James Cook aboard on 25 April 1770, two days after Saint George&#x27;s Day, and he named the southern headland Cape St George.

In August 1791, Lieutenant Richard Bowen, aboard the convict transport ship &quot;Atlantic&quot;, part of the Third Fleet, sailed into the bay and named it in honour of Admiral John Jervis, under whom he had served. In November 1791 Master Matthew Weatherhead entered the bay aboard , which had also been part of the Third Fleet, in order to undertake repairs to the ship.

In mid 1797, survivors of the wreck of passed through the area on foot, while undertaking an arduous trek of 600 kilometres in an attempt to get to Port Jackson (Sydney) – only three of them completed the journey.

Explorer George Bass entered the bay on 10 December 1797 and named Bowen Island.

Alexander Berry&#x27;s takeover of land in the Shoalhaven displaced the Aboriginal inhabitants, who were moved to Wreck Bay in 1822. Smallpox and syphilis significantly reduced their population. A separate population of Aborigines, whom settlers called &quot;the Jervis Bay tribe&quot; — the Wandandian people — remained on their traditional lands on the bank of Currambene Creek, near Huskisson, and around St Georges Basin, until well into the 20th century.

In 1841, the private township of South Huskisson on Jervis Bay was founded as a seaport and terminus of The Wool Road. It was renamed Vincentia in 1952.

The bay was a base for whaling in 1912 and 1913. The vessels involved were the factory ship &quot;Loch Tay&quot; and her two catchers &quot;Campbell&quot; and &quot;Sorrell&quot;.

In 1915, the land now comprising the Jervis Bay Territory was surrendered to the Commonwealth Government by the state of New South Wales. It was proposed that it would become a seaport for the new federal capital under construction at Canberra, which would be Australia&#x27;s only inland capital.

In the late 1960s, Australia&#x27;s first nuclear power plant was proposed for the area, and a site was prepared, but the project did not proceed.

In 1995, Jervis Bay National Park and Botanic Gardens were handed back to the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community. In 1997, the community, who jointly manage the park with the Commonwealth Government, decided to rename it Booderee National Park and Botanic Gardens.

==Geography==
===Geology===
Jervis Bay is a drowned river valley and formed 15,000 years ago, at the end of the last ice age. The bay took on its present appearance around 4000 BC after the sea levels had risen , and as sand dune barriers created the southern peninsula. Much of the rock in Jervis Bay is part of the Sydney Basin sandstone formation, which is 280-225 million years old, although lower areas are overlain with Tertiary-era sediments.

Several features at Jervis Bay have been used as evidence that the Australian coast experienced many giant tsunamis prior to European colonisation.

===Description===
In the Jervis Bay Territory on the southern side of the bay are the settlements of Greenpatch, Hyams Beach, and Bowen Island. From north to south on the New South Wales shore of the bay are Callala Beach, Callala Bay, Huskisson and Vincentia. Beecroft Peninsula, on the northern side of the bay, has been used as a bombing range by the RAN. Point Perpendicular forms the southern end of the peninsula. Jervis Bay is approximately a three-hour drive south of Sydney. A door-to-door shuttle service is available between Sydney Airport and the South Coast every day.

==Environment and protected areas==

Significant areas of the Jervis Bay natural environment have been established as protected areas, including Booderee National Park, Jervis Bay National Park (NSW) and the Jervis Bay Marine Park.

Some of the land on both sides of the bay have been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because the coastal heathland supports the largest sub-population of the endangered eastern bristlebird, isolated from other sub-populations.

Jervis Bay has been recorded as having the whitest sand in the world.

==Recreation==
Jervis Bay is known for recreational fishing, kayaking, paddleboarding, sailing and scuba diving, with tour operators departing from Huskisson and amateurs using boat ramps at bayside towns and camp sites. Popular diving sites include The Labyrinths, Gorgonian Wall, Point Perpendicular, a submerged Fairey Firefly aeroplane, scallop beds, Middle Ground, Ten Fathom Reef, and Bowen Island.

Jervis Bay is also known for whale watching, because whale migration, both north and south, can be observed as the animals pass the entrance to the bay, frequently entering the sheltered waters to rest. The majority of whales sighted at Jervis Bay are humpbacks, which migrate along Australia&#x27;s east coast from June to November. Southern right whales are also showing a slow but steady increase in recent years as they re-colonise former habitats, having been extensively hunted in the 19th and 20th centuries. Other species sighted have been false killer whales, orcas, minke whales and, on one occasion, a blue whale.

==Tourism==
Tourism in Jervis Bay is one of the most important avenues of income for many of the local residents, with many businesses orienting themselves towards it. The Jervis Bay Visitors Information Centre is at Huskisson, and is part of the Lady Denman Maritime Museum and Gallery. Local council-managed visitor information centres are at Nowra and Ulladulla.

==Aquaculture==
The first commercial aquaculture licence for an area in the bay was granted in 2015, for an enterprise which started growing blue mussels. They also found abundant Angasi oysters and scallops growing on the lines which they dropped at first, but the industry focus is on the blue mussels, which have a high ratio of meat to shell. The first full-scale commercial harvest of blue mussels was scheduled for November 2020. The potential of growing seaweeds for commercial use is also being explored, and Shoalhaven City Council is investing to develop a wharf, boat maintenance facility and other infrastructure needed to service the industry. It is hoped that the industry will create up to 1,000 jobs.

==Climate==
Jervis Bay experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;), with average maximum temperatures varying from 16 °C in winter to 25 °C in summer tempered by sea breezes. Since 2001, the highest recorded temperature is 42.1 °C on 1 January 2006, and the lowest 4.7 °C on 13 August 2005. Hot summer evenings are often relieved by a front of rapidly moving cool air known as a southerly buster.

Rainfall is fairly evenly distributed throughout the seasons, with a bias to the first half of the year, due to prevailing easterlies. Short high intensity rainfall events may happen at any time of the year and can lead to local flooding. Jervis Bay also experiences thunderstorms during the warmer months bringing lightning, heavy rain and occasionally hail. With an annual rainfall around 1,200 mm, it is wetter than other areas in the South Coast due to its exposed eastward location on a peninsula facing the Tasman Sea, thus making it more susceptible to moist easterly flows. Yearly rainfall is influenced by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.

<doc id="526780" wikidata="Q2816318" url="?curid=526780" title="35-hour workweek">
<text>The 35-hour workweek is a labour reform policy adopted in France in February 2000, under Prime Minister Lionel Jospin&#x27;s Plural Left government. Promoted by Minister of Labour Martine Aubry, it was adopted in two phases: the &quot;Aubry 1&quot; law in June 1998 and the &quot;Aubry 2&quot; law in January 2000. The previous legal working week was 39 hours, established by President François Mitterrand, also a member of the Socialist Party. The 35-hour working week had been on the Socialist Party&#x27;s 1981 electoral program, titled 110 Propositions for France, but was not pursued because of the poor state of the economy.

Time worked after the standard legal limit of 35 hours is considered overtime. The reform&#x27;s aim is primarily to lower the unemployment rate, then at a record high of 12.5%, by encouraging the creation of jobs with work sharing.

== Objectives ==

The main stated objectives of the law were to create new jobs, by making it more cost effective to hire an additional worker than to pay current staff overtime, and the pursuit of decommodification of France&#x27;s citizens, by lowering the amount of time dedicated to work without lowering their standard of living. Additionally, the Jospin government was able to advantage of the changes introduced with the 35-hour workweek to relax other workforce legislation.

== Implementation ==
The Aubry 1 law was passed in 1998. It served as an encouragement for businesses to transition voluntarily to a 35-hour workweek. It did so by offering a reduced payroll tax for all businesses that lowered their current employees&#x27; working hours and hired additional workers before January 2000.

The Aubry 2 law was adopted in January 2000. It legally lowered the standard hours worked per week from 39 to 35 for companies with more than 20 employees. Small businesses had until January 2002 to prepare for the shift. Additional hours worked after 35 then had to be paid at the overtime premium of 25% for the first eight hours, and then at a 50% premium for any further hours.

Businesses were required to sign an agreement with unions to bargain over the hourly wage increase, to make up for the potential loss of income by the employees&#x27; decreasing work time. Unions wanted to ensure that the reduced weekly hours would not result in a reduced income. Their slogan was &quot;35 hours pays 39&quot;.

To motivate companies to compromise with unions, the government offered social security rebates to all firms that signed contracts with unions agreeing to a 35-hour workweek and wage increases. The legislation explicitly stated that monthly income must stay at the same level, however this only applied to minimum wage workers. To help small companies make the transition, the government increased the annual limit on overtime hours for small companies and set their overtime premiums at a lower rate.

== Amendments ==
The Raffarin government, some members of which were vocal critics of the law, gradually pushed for further relaxation of the legal working time requirements. On 22 December 2004, the French Parliament extended the maximum number of overtime hours per year from 180 to 220 under the Fallon laws. The reforms also reduced the payroll tax cuts given to companies that implemented the 35-hour workweek.

On 31 March 2005, another law extended the possibilities of overtime hours.

In August 2016, the El Khomri law reduced overtime payments.

== Results ==
Professor Fabrice Gilles at the University of Lille studied the impact of the Aubry laws, by analyzing data on capital operating time (the average time that capital equipment is in use at firms) from the Bank of France and administrative files on work time regulation agreements from the French Ministry of Labour. He found that capital operating time has not decreased in shift-work firms, because they responded by increasing the intensity of night-shift work and adding some additional overtime. In fact, shift-work companies have expanded scheduled hours to preserve output and increase productivity. Non-shift-work companies have decreased their capital operating costs.

There has not been a significant rise in dual jobholding as a result of the reduction of full-time employment work hours.

Even though the standard hours worked in a week has been lowered to 35, some occupations demand more. The French bar association (CNB) says that 44% of lawyers in the country worked 55 hours or more a week in 2008. Part-time workers work an average 23.3 hours a week in France, compared to the European average of 20.1 hours.

After being implemented, the Aubry reforms were credited with lowering unemployment and expanding the economy, although they have been met with legislative proposals for additional reforms.

== Criticism ==

Businesses have overhead costs such as training, rent and employment taxes that do not adjust with operating hours. The expenses and higher wages cause the cost benefit of hiring an extra worker to go down, and raise the incremental cost of each additional worker.

Generally speaking, left-wing parties and trade unions support the reduction, while right-wing parties and the MEDEF employer federation oppose it. Critics of the 35-hour working week have argued that it has failed to serve its purpose because an increase in recruitment has not occurred. In their view, the reluctance of firms to take on new workers has instead simply increased hourly production quotas. According to right-wing parties and economic commentators, the main reason that French firms avoid hiring new workers is that French employment regulations on labour flexibility make it difficult to lay off workers during poor economic periods.

<doc id="526791" wikidata="Q699809" url="?curid=526791" title="You're Under Arrest (manga)">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kōsuke Fujishima. It was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;seinen&quot; manga magazines &quot;Morning Party Zōkan&quot; and &quot;Morning&quot; from 1986 through 1992. It centers on a fictional police station in Sumida, Tokyo, as its officers tackle everyday criminals while keeping people safe. It mixes both drama and action with humor.

The chapters of &quot;You&#x27;re Under Arrest&quot; have been collected in seven &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes by Kodansha. The manga has been adapted into three television seasons, three OVA series and a film, all animated by Studio Deen. The series also spawned a live-action drama special starring Misaki Ito and Sachie Hara. The show has received positive reviews from critics.

==Story==

The series follows Natsumi Tsujimoto and Miyuki Kobayakawa, two female officers of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. They are stationed at the fictional Bokuto Police Station located at Sumida, Tokyo. The series is largely episodic, and it focuses on the interaction between the main characters and the humorous supporting cast.

The majority of the series takes place in the Greater Tokyo Area. However, the site where the Bokuto Police Station is supposed to be does not exist in the Sumida Ward. In reality, the Bokuto Hospital takes its place.

==Media==

===Manga===
The English version of the manga was published by Dark Horse Comics, which only contained selected episodes from volumes 6 and 7 (reportedly at Fujishima&#x27;s request, resulting in continuity confusion by some fans of the series). The final frame of the last Japanese volume refers to a &quot;You&#x27;re Under Arrest 2&quot;, which has not yet been serialized.

A special one-shot chapter, titled &quot;Taiho Shichauzo GP&quot;, appeared in &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; on December 23, 2022.

The first two television series were aired with English subtitles on AXN Asia&#x27;s networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia.

AnimEigo licensed the initial OVA series, the first television series, and the only full-length television episode of &quot;You&#x27;re Under Arrest&quot; that aired in 1999 for North American release. ADV Films subsequently released the 1999 mini-TV episodes that comprised the rest of &quot;You&#x27;re Under Arrest! Mini-Specials&quot; as well as the movie. The 2001 TV series, the 2002 OVA TV special and &quot;Full Throttle&quot; are licensed in North America by Sentai Filmworks and distributed by Section23 Films.

In South Korea, Tooniverse licensed the OVA series until 2nd season.

TBS is in charge of promoting the 2nd season, movie and &quot;Full Throttle!&quot; outside of Japan.

===Film===
The film ran for 90 minutes in the United States and 92 minutes in France.

===Video game===
Released on March 29, 2001 by Pioneer LDC for the PlayStation, the game is a text adventure game that introduces three new characters. One of them is a detective named Ryosuke Arisugawa, a 24-year-old plainclothed officer assigned to Bokuto Police Station in order to identify and arrest a hacker who was trying to break into the precinct&#x27;s network system. Another character is his 18-year-old sister Chiharu Arisugawa, who the player must keep an eye on.

Players can assign various characters from the Bokuto Station to conduct patrols around the neighborhood.

===Novel===
A novel was published by Kodansha. It is a stand-alone story from the series, detailing a fight with Miyuki and Natsumi due to the latter being late for work again in Bokuto Station. Work on the novel had been supervised by Kōsuke Fujishima himself personally with Atsuko Nakajima doing the artwork in the novel.

===TV drama===
A TV drama was created and aired on TV Asahi in 2002. The opening theme song was called &quot;Galaxy&quot; by Nana Katase, and the closing theme was &quot;Through the Rain&quot; by Mariah Carey. It adapted the main characters while adding new characters over the course of the nine-episode series. The drama also advances the romantic relationships of the main characters. Each episode ran for 45 minutes each.

===Model kits===
Two models were created and titled Honda Today and Natsumi&#x27;s motorcycle. Each are scale.

==Reception==
Shortly after &quot;You&#x27;re Under Arrest 2&quot; came out, &quot;You&#x27;re Under Arrest&quot; was among the top 10 anime shows in &quot;Newtype&quot;s August 2001 issue.

Regarding the &quot;Full Throttle&quot; revival series, Theron Martin commented that &quot;Little that the series does in these episodes is especially fresh or memorable, but if you were always a fan of the Bokuto Traffic Section&#x27;s antics in the earlier series then that enjoyment is unlikely to fade here.&quot;. Similarly, Chris Beveridge said that &quot;Though this season pales for a lot of people because some of the supporting cast are either minimized or gone entirely, I appreciated the return to dealing with the core cast of characters after all this time.&quot;.

<text>The Taymyr Peninsula ( ) is a peninsula in the Far North of Russia, in the Siberian Federal District, that forms the northernmost part of the mainland of Eurasia. Administratively it is part of the Krasnoyarsk Krai Federal subject of Russia.

==Geography==
The Taymyr Peninsula lies between the Yenisei Gulf of the Kara Sea and the Khatanga Gulf of the Laptev Sea.

Lake Taymyr and the Byrranga Mountains are located within the vast Taymyr Peninsula.

Cape Chelyuskin, the northernmost point of the Eurasian continent, is located at the northern end of the Taymyr Peninsula.

== Etymology ==
There are several theories about the origin of the name &quot;Taimyr.&quot; The most widely accepted explanation is that it comes from the Evenki language, originating from the ancient Tungus word &quot;tamura,&quot; which means &quot;valuable, precious, rich.&quot; The Evenki people originally used this name for the Taimyr River, known for its abundance of fish. In the 19th century, thanks to the geographer and explorer Alexander von Middendorff (1815–1894), the name came to refer to the entire peninsula.

Other interpretations exist as well. For example, in Yakut, &quot;tuoy muora&quot; translates to &quot;salt lake,&quot; which can also be understood metaphorically as &quot;fertile&quot; or &quot;blessed,&quot; since salt is vital for the health of reindeer. Another Yakut version, &quot;Tymyr,&quot; means &quot;blood vessel.&quot;

In the Nenets language, &quot;tai myarey&quot; means &quot;bald&quot; or &quot;bare,&quot; possibly in reference to the region’s low-growing tundra.

In the Nganasan language, &quot;taa mire&quot; translates to &quot;reindeer paths.&quot;

==Population==
The Nenets people, also known as &quot;Samoyeds&quot;, are an indigenous people in northern arctic Russia, and some live at the Taymyr Peninsula.

The Nganasan people are an indigenous Samoyedic people inhabiting central Siberia, including the Taymyr Peninsula. In the Russian Federation, they are recognized as being one of the Small-Numbered peoples of the Russian North. They reside primarily in the settlements of Ust-Avam, Volachanka, and Novaya in the Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District of Krasnoyarsk Krai, with smaller populations residing in the towns of Dudinka and Norilsk as well. The isolated location of the Nganasan people enabled them to maintain shamanistic practices even in the 20th century.

==Economy==
MMC Norilsk Nickel conducts mining operations in the area. The company conducts smelting operations in the area of the city of Norilsk, near the peninsula. The nickel ore concentrate and other products of the company are transported over a short railroad to the port city of Dudinka on the Yenisei River, and from there by boat to Murmansk and other ports.

==Ecology==
The peninsula is the site of the last known naturally occurring muskox outside of North America, which died out about 2,000 years ago. They were successfully reintroduced in 1975. The population grew to 2,500 in 2002, increasing to 6,500 in 2010.

Study in 2021 found that based on eDNA, woolly mammoths survived on the Taymyr Peninsula until 3,900 to 4,100 years ago, roughly concurrent with the Wrangel population. The Taymyr Peninsula, with its drier habitat, may have served as a refugium for the mammoth steppe, supporting mammoths and other widespread Ice Age mammals such as wild horses (&quot;Equus&quot; sp.).

==Climate==
The coasts of the Taymyr Peninsula are frozen most of the year, between September and June on average. The summer season is short, especially on the shores of the Laptev Sea in the northeast. The climate in the north and exterior of the peninsula is Tundra Climate (ET), while some areas further-south have a very cold but somewhat more continental subarctic climate, with winters even slightly colder than the tundra directly to the north, but with somewhat warmer summers that can support some tree growth. Winters are harsh, with frequent blizzards and extremely low temperatures. The following data for Cape Chelyuskin provides an indication of the weather experienced in the northern part of the peninsula.

<doc id="526797" wikidata="Q755034" url="?curid=526797" title="Atheist (band)">
<text>Atheist is a Florida death metal band from Sarasota, Florida, founded in 1987.

The band&#x27;s original lineup consisted vocalist and rhythm guitarist Kelly Shaefer, lead guitarist Rand Burkey, bassist Roger Patterson and drummer Steve Flynn. The band is known for its highly technical playing style, and its 1991 album &quot;Unquestionable Presence&quot; is regarded as a landmark of the technical death metal genre. The band managed to gain a reputation in the underground. After disbanding in 1994, the group reformed in 2006 and has since released one studio album and a live DVD.

== History ==

The band was originally formed in 1984 in Sarasota, Florida, firstly under the name Oblivion and later as R.A.V.A.G.E. (which stands for &quot;Raging Atheists Vowing A Gory End&quot;). They released their first album, &quot;Piece of Time&quot;, in 1989. Shortly before entering the studio to record their second album, Roger Patterson died on February 12, 1991, in a car accident at the age of 22. Shortly afterwards, they recruited ex-Pestilence and Cynic bassist Tony Choy to record their second album, &quot;Unquestionable Presence&quot;. Atheist disbanded for the first time in 1992, then reunited in 1993 to record a third album, &quot;Elements&quot;, fulfilling their contractual requirements, before disbanding for a second time in early 1994.

Seven years after their second breakup, Shaefer decided to re-release and remaster their three albums with different bonus tracks.

Relapse Records reissued the band&#x27;s three albums in late 2005, as well as a vinyl box set containing the three albums plus the R.A.V.A.G.E. demo &quot;On They Slay&quot;. Flynn formed the band Gnostic in the same year. In January 2006, Atheist announced they were regrouping to perform live during the summer and autumn. The line-up was Shaefer, Burkey, Choy and Flynn. Shaefer only provided vocals due to long battles with tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome. The Gnostic guitarist Sonny Carson played all of Shaefer&#x27;s guitar parts, while Burkey was later replaced by Chris Baker of Gnostic.

On July 12, 2008, Shaefer issued a statement indicating that he and Flynn were working on new material. A month later, Shaefer announced that they had commenced the recording of a new studio album, which would be their first in over 15 years. The band toured Europe and the US in 2009 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of &quot;Piece of Time&quot;. A live DVD filmed at the Wacken Open Air Festival appeared towards the end of the year.

On July 11, 2010, Atheist revealed that their fourth studio album would be called &quot;Jupiter&quot; and was set for a November release. They signed a deal with Season of Mist and &quot;Jupiter&quot; was released on November 8, 2010.

On August 3, 2010, Shaefer and Flynn announced on behalf of the band that Tony Choy would not be appearing on &quot;Jupiter&quot; but was still likely to appear in live performances with the band due to his own musical aspirations. The band announced in 2014 that it was working on a fifth studio album, which was planned to be released in 2015; however, the album would be left unreleased for over half a decade.

In February 2018, Atheist signed with Agonia Records, and the band plans to release their fifth studio album for the label.

==Musical style and legacy==
Atheist are considered one of the pioneers of technical death metal. Mike DaRonco of Allmusic said Atheist are &quot;arguably the ultimate progressive metal band of their day&quot;. Atheist have also been noted for elements of thrash metal, jazz and progressive rock present in their music. According to Langdon Hickman of Invisible Oranges, &quot;Like almost every metal band of the 1980s, Atheist also did not go untouched by progressive metal. Progressive rock mostly filtered into heavy metal through those 1970s hard rock and heavy metal bands that laid [the] foundational roots for the metal of the 1980s.&quot; Vocalist Kelly Shaefer said, &quot;One of the main reasons Atheist ended up being such a strange band was we were trying so hard not to sound like anybody else that we went way overboard. We were outsiders within an outsider&#x27;s scene so we made it doubly hard for ourselves.&quot;

<text>The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) was a state-run health sciences institution with six locations in New Jersey.

It was founded as the Seton Hall College of Medicine and Dentistry in 1954, and by the 1980s was both a major school of health sciences, and a major research university. On July 1, 2013, it was dissolved, with most of its schools merging with Rutgers University to form a new Rutgers School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, while the School of Osteopathic Medicine, including its Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, became part of Rowan University and was renamed the Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine.

==History==

The university had two primary predecessor finding organizations:

* Seton Hall College of Medicine and Dentistry (1956), including two constituent colleges (medicine, dentistry)
* Rutgers Medical School (1966)

In 1965, the State of New Jersey took over Seton Hall&#x27;s schools and merged them with the Rutgers school, forming the College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (CMDNJ).

In 1981, it was renamed to the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ).

=== Seton Hall ===
The Seton Hall College of Medicine and Dentistry was incorporated on August 6, 1954. The college enrolled its first class in 1956 at the Jersey City Medical Center. This was the forerunner of the New Jersey Medical School, the New Jersey Dental School, and the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. In 1965, the college was acquired by the state of New Jersey and renamed the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry (NJCMD).

=== Rutgers Medical School ===
Rutgers Medical School opened in 1966 as a two-year basic science institution offering the master of medical science (M.M.S.) degree.

=== State takeover and merger ===
The College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (CMDNJ) was created by legislature in 1968 with the consolidation of the boards of trustees of Rutgers Medical School (now Robert Wood Johnson Medical School) and New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry. It was the largest school of health sciences of its kind in the United States. It was also the leading research university in New Jersey, edging the other major research universities in the state (including Princeton University and Rutgers University) in federal research grant dollars. It did, however, have various academic partnerships with universities and other institutions in New Jersey.

=== Relocation to Newark ===
In 1966 plans were made to move the school from Jersey City to Newark. Residents of the neighborhood targeted as the new location were blindsided by the decision. Community organizations banded together to oppose the relocation of the school, citing displacement of 20,000 people and businesses. President Johnson&#x27;s Model City Act dictated community involvement. In 1968 Robert Wood, undersecretary of Housing and Urban Development, representatives from President Johnson&#x27;s administration, and Governor Hughes urged Newark&#x27;s Mayor Hugh Addonizio to negotiate in good faith with the community organizations as mandated by the Model City Act.

On March 15, 1968, a substantial agreement was made. One of the demands included was a smaller site than the 150 acres initially approved. In compromise the site was reduced to 57.9 acres, with another 63 acres was to be designated for housing and other related facilities to be developed and built by community organizations. Other compromises were the development of Community Health programs and an upgrade to the current Newark Community Hospital. The community secured jobs by mandating that 1/3 of the day laborers to build the hospital and college, and 1/3 of the workforce to run it were black and Latino. They also mandated the admittance of minority students into its program and the inaugural class had 28 minority students. This agreement became known as the Newark Accords. A binding agreement between the Community Organizations and the city, it also became the framework for other cities to follow in their negotiations. The University Hospital is a direct result of those agreements.

==Tuition raise ==
In July 2010, UMDNJ&#x27;s board of trustees voted to raise tuition up to 21 percent for out-of-state students and up to 18% for in-state students. The changes occurred after medical students had already begun their clinical rotations, signed into housing agreements, and received their financial aid packages. Returning students received an additional bill after the academic year had already started. They had anticipated an increase of up to 4% based on historical data and their acceptance letters. However, Governor Chris Christie had passed a tuition cap of 4% for public universities on undergraduate tuition in 2010. In the students&#x27; eyes, the unprecedented increase in tuition was viewed as a way to make up a sudden financial deficit in UMDNJ&#x27;s budget, though there was a lack of transparency by the UMDNJ Board of Trustees and President Denise Rodgers at the time.

==Dissolution==
On 1 July 2013, UMDNJ was dissolved under legislation passed by the New Jersey state legislature on 28 June 2012 and signed by Chris Christie in August. University Hospital became an independent organization. Rowan University took over the School of Osteopathic Medicine. The other component schools were taken over by the Rutgers University system.

The School of Pharmacy was not part of the transfer, as it had been part of Rutgers University since 1927.

==Academics==
UMDNJ was made up of 8 schools:

*New Jersey Medical School – Newark
*New Jersey Dental School – Newark
*Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences – Newark, Piscataway, and Stratford
*School of Health Related Professions – Newark
*School of Nursing – Newark
*School of Public Health – New Brunswick
*Robert Wood Johnson Medical School – Piscataway
*School of Osteopathic Medicine – Stratford

UMDNJ also operated The University Hospital in Newark and the Raritan Valley Hospital in Greenbrook, New Jersey, while Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, Hackensack University Medical Center in Hackensack and Cooper University Hospital in Camden were affiliates of UMDNJ. UMDNJ also operated a palliative care facility for people living with AIDS.

UMDNJ had approximately 7,000 students in more than 100 degree and certificate programs; more than 13,000 employees, including nearly 2,500 faculty members; more than 31,000 alumni and more than 200 education and healthcare affiliates throughout New Jersey. The university was dedicated to pursuing excellence in the education of health professionals and scientists, conducting research, delivering healthcare, and serving the community. The National Science Foundation ranked UMDNJ #71 out of 630 universities and colleges in terms of R&amp;D expenditures.

==Controversy and scandals==
UMDNJ was involved in a series of Medicaid over-billings. The criminal complaint filed against the institution charged that health-care fraud occurred through alleged double-billing of Medicaid between May 2001 and November 2004 for physician services in outpatient clinics. A deferred prosecution agreement was filed in federal court in Newark, N.J., December 29, 2005 to avoid prosecution. Herbert Jay Stern, a former U.S. Attorney and federal judge in New Jersey, was appointed as a federal monitor to oversee and enforce compliance in accordance with the deferred prosecution agreement that outlines reform and action to help resolve illegal practices and restore financial integrity and professionalism to the institution. The monitor soon discovered dental students were being given credit for classes they did not attend. Local doctors were rewarded for no-show jobs at the school in exchange for sending patients to the cardiac-surgery center.

In March 2008, UMDNJ announced that its accreditation by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education had been restored, following the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement; Stern had recommended the return of full responsibility for governance of the institution to UMDNJ&#x27;s board of trustees after implementation of a number of systemic reforms by the Board and administration.

In Stratford, New Jersey, at the UMDNJ School of Osteopathic Medicine, Warren Wallace, the prior Senior Associate Dean for Academic and Student Affairs, was terminated amid accusations of unethical behavior. Accusations include inappropriate use of UMDNJ time and resources for political activities, efforts to obtain no-bid contracts for a friend or neighbor, and inappropriate actions in relation to obtaining admission to the School of Osteopathic Medicine for his daughter.

UMDNJ had placed New Jersey Senator Wayne Bryant on a &quot;no-show&quot; job to increase funding for the school, Bryant being the chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee and the Legislature&#x27;s Joint Budget Oversight Committee. Bryant stepped down from this position in February 2007. The case was investigated by former United States Attorney (later New Jersey governor) Christopher Christie. Bryant was found guilty of the charges on November 19, 2008, and received a four-year sentence in federal prison. R. Michael Gallagher, former dean of the School of Osteopathic Medicine, was convicted of bribing Bryant and received an 18-month sentence.

<doc id="526807" wikidata="Q636427" url="?curid=526807" title="Nominal rigidity">
<text>In economics, nominal rigidity, also known as price-stickiness or wage-stickiness, is a situation in which a nominal price is resistant to change. Complete nominal rigidity occurs when a price is fixed in nominal terms for a relevant period of time. For example, the price of a particular good might be fixed at $10 per unit for a year. Partial nominal rigidity occurs when a price may vary in nominal terms, but not as much as it would if perfectly flexible. For example, in a regulated market there might be limits to how much a price can change in a given year.

If one looks at the whole economy, some prices might be very flexible and others rigid. This will lead to the aggregate price level (which we can think of as an average of the individual prices) becoming &quot;sluggish&quot; or &quot;sticky&quot; in the sense that it does not respond to macroeconomic shocks as much as it would if all prices were flexible. The same idea can apply to nominal wages. The presence of nominal rigidity is an important part of macroeconomic theory since it can explain why markets might not reach equilibrium in the short run or even possibly the long run. In his &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;, John Maynard Keynes argued that nominal wages display downward rigidity, in the sense that workers are reluctant to accept cuts in nominal wages. This can lead to involuntary unemployment as it takes time for wages to adjust to equilibrium, a situation he thought applied to the Great Depression.

==Evidence==

There is now a considerable amount of evidence about how long price-spells last, and it suggests that there is a considerable degree of nominal price rigidity in the &quot;complete sense&quot; of prices remaining unchanged. A price-spell is a duration during which the nominal price of a particular item remains unchanged. For some items, such as gasoline or tomatoes, prices are observed to vary frequently resulting in many short price spells. For other items, such as the cost of a bottle of champagne or the cost of a meal in a restaurant, the price might remain fixed for an extended period of time (many months or even years). One of the richest sources of information about this is the price-quote data used to construct the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The statistical agencies in many countries collect tens of thousands of price-quotes for specific items each month in order to construct the CPI. In the early years of the 21st century, there were several major studies of nominal price rigidity in the US and Europe using the CPI price quote microdata. The following table gives nominal rigidity as reflected in the frequency of prices changing on average per month in several countries. For example, in France and the UK, each month on average, 19% of prices change (81% are unchanged), which implies that an average price spell lasts about 5.3 months (the expected duration of a price spell is equal to the reciprocal of the frequency of price change if we interpret the empirical frequency as representing the Bernoulli probability of price change generating a negative binomial distribution of durations of price-spells).

The fact that price spells last on average for 3.7 months does not mean that prices are not sticky. That is because many price changes are temporary (for example sales) and prices revert to their usual or &quot;reference price&quot;. Removing sales and temporary price cuts raises the average length of price-spells considerably: in the US it more than doubled the mean spell duration to 11 months. The reference price can remain unchanged for an average of 14.5 months in the US data. 
Also, it is prices that we are interested in. If the price of tomatoes changes every month, the tomatoes price will generate 12 price spells in a year. Another price that is just as important (for example, canned tomatoes) might only change once per year (one price spell of 12 months). Looking at these two goods prices alone, we observe that there are 13 price spells with an average duration of (12+13)/13 equals about 2 months. However, if we average across the two items (tomatoes and canned tomatoes), we see that the average spell is 6.5 months (12+1)/2. The distribution of price spell durations and its mean are heavily influenced by prices generating short price spells. If we are looking at nominal rigidity in an economy, we are more interested in the distribution of durations across prices rather than the distribution of price spell durations in itself. There is thus considerable evidence that prices are sticky in the &quot;complete&quot; sense, that the prices remain on average unchanged for a prolonged period of time (around 12 months). Partial nominal rigidity is less easy to measure, since it is difficult to distinguish whether a price that changes is changing less than it would if it were perfectly flexible.

Linking micro data of prices and cost, Carlsson and Nordström Skans (2012), showed that firms consider both current and future expected cost when setting prices. The finding that the expectation of future conditions matter for the price set today provides strong evidence in favor of nominal rigidity and the forward looking behavior of the price setters implied by the models of sticky prices outlined below.

==Modeling sticky prices==
Economists have tried to model sticky prices in a number of ways. These models can be classified as either time-dependent, where firms change prices with the passage of time and decide to change prices &quot;independently&quot; of the economic environment, or state-dependent, where firms decide to change prices &quot;in response to changes&quot; in the economic environment. The differences can be thought of as differences in a two-stage process: In time-dependent models, firms decide to change prices and then evaluate market conditions; In state-dependent models, firms evaluate market conditions and then decide how to respond.

In time-dependent models price changes are staggered exogenously, so a fixed percentage of firms change prices at a given time. There is no selection as to which firms change prices. Two commonly used time-dependent models are based on papers by John B. Taylor and Guillermo Calvo. In Taylor (1980), firms change prices every &quot;n&quot;th period. In Calvo (1983), price changes follow a Poisson process. In both models the choice of changing prices is independent of the inflation rate.

The Taylor model is one where firms set the price knowing exactly how long the price will last (the duration of the price spell). Firms are divided into cohorts, so that each period the same proportion of firms reset their price. For example, with two-period price-spells, half of the firms reset their price each period. Thus the aggregate price level is an average of the new price set this period and the price set last period and still remaining for half of the firms. In general, if price-spells last for &quot;n&quot; periods, a proportion of 1/&quot;n&quot; firms reset their price each period and the general price is an average of the prices set now and in the preceding &quot;n&quot; − 1 periods. At any point in time, there will be a uniform distribution of ages of price-spells: (1/&quot;n&quot;) will be new prices in their first period, 1/&quot;n&quot; in their second period, and so on until 1/&quot;n&quot; will be &quot;n&quot; periods old. The average age of price-spells will be (&quot;n&quot; + 1)/2 (if the first period is counted as 1).

In the Calvo staggered contracts model, there is a constant probability h that the firm can set a new price. Thus a proportion h of firms can reset their price in any period, whilst the remaining proportion (1 − &quot;h&quot;) keep their price constant. In the Calvo model, when a firm sets its price, it does not know how long the price-spell will last. Instead, the firm faces a probability distribution over possible price-spell durations. The probability that the price will last for &quot;i&quot; periods is (1 − &quot;h&quot;)&quot;i&quot;−1, and the expected duration is &quot;h&quot;−1. For example, if &quot;h&quot; = 0.25, then a quarter of firms will rest their price each period, and the expected duration for the price-spell is 4. There is no upper limit to how long price-spells may last: although the probability becomes small over time, it is always strictly positive. Unlike the Taylor model where all completed price-spells have the same length, there will at any time be a distribution of completed price-spell lengths.

In state-dependent models the decision to change prices is based on changes in the market and is not related to the passage of time. Most models relate the decision to change prices to menu costs. Firms change prices when the benefit of changing a price becomes larger than the menu cost of changing a price. Price changes may be bunched or staggered over time. Prices change faster and monetary shocks are over faster under state dependent than time. Examples of state-dependent models include the one proposed by Golosov and Lucas and one suggested by Dotsey, King and Wolman.

==Significance in macroeconomics==

In macroeconomics, nominal rigidity is necessary to explain how money (and hence monetary policy and inflation) can affect the real economy and why the classical dichotomy breaks down.

If nominal wages and prices were not sticky, or &quot;perfectly flexible&quot;, they would always adjust such that there would be equilibrium in the economy. In a perfectly flexible economy, monetary shocks would lead to immediate changes in the level of nominal prices, leaving real quantities (e.g. output, employment) unaffected. This is sometimes called monetary neutrality or &quot;the neutrality of money&quot;.

For money to have real effects, some degree of nominal rigidity is required so that prices and wages do not respond immediately. Hence sticky prices play an important role in all mainstream macroeconomic theory: Monetarists, Keynesians and new Keynesians all agree that markets fail to clear because prices fail to drop to market clearing levels when there is a drop in demand. Such models are used to explain unemployment. Neoclassical models, common in microeconomics, predict that involuntary unemployment (where an individual is willing to work, but unable to find a job) should not exist, as this would lead employers to cut wages; this would continue until unemployment was no longer a problem. While such models can be useful in other markets where prices adjust more readily, sticky wages are a common way to explain why workers cannot find jobs: as wages cannot be cut instantaneously, they will sometimes be too high for the market to clear.

Since prices and wages cannot move instantly, price- and wage-setters become forward looking. The notion that expectations of future conditions affect current price- and wage-setting decisions is a keystone for much of the current monetary policy analysis based on Keynesian macroeconomic models and the implied policy advice.

Huw Dixon and Claus Hansen showed that even if only part of the economy has sticky prices, this can influence prices in other sectors and lead to prices in the rest of the economy becoming less responsive to changes in demand. Thus price and wage stickiness in one sector can &quot;spill over&quot; and lead to the economy behaving in a more Keynesian way.

===Mathematical example: a little price stickiness can go a long way===
To see how a small sector with a fixed price can affect the way rest of the flexible prices behave, suppose that there are two sectors in the economy: a proportion &quot;a&quot; with flexible prices &quot;Pf&quot; and a proportion 1 − &quot;a&quot; that are affected by menu costs with sticky prices &quot;Pm&quot;. Suppose that the flexible price sector price &quot;Pf&quot; has the market clearing condition of the following form:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the aggregate price index (which would result if consumers had Cobb-Douglas preferences over the two goods). The equilibrium condition says that the real flexible price equals some constant (for example formula_3 could be real marginal cost). Now we have a remarkable result: no matter how small the menu cost sector, so long as &quot;a&quot; &lt; 1, the flexible prices get &quot;pegged&quot; to the fixed price. Using the aggregate price index the equilibrium condition becomes
:formula_4
which implies that
:formula_5
so that
:formula_6
What this result says is that no matter how small the sector affected by menu-costs, it will tie down the flexible price. In macroeconomic terms all nominal prices will be sticky, even those in the potentially flexible price sector, so that changes in nominal demand will feed through into changes in output in both the menu-cost sector and the flexible price sector.

Now, this is of course an extreme result resulting from the real rigidity taking the form of a constant real marginal cost. For example, if we allowed for the real marginal cost to vary with aggregate output &quot;Y&quot;, then we would have

:formula_7

so that the flexible prices would vary with output &quot;Y&quot;. However, the presence of the fixed prices in the menu-cost sector would still act to dampen the responsiveness of the flexible prices, although this would now depend upon the size of the menu-cost sector &quot;a&quot;, the sensitivity of formula_8 to &quot;Y&quot; and so on.

==Sticky information==

In macroeconomics, sticky information is old information used by agents as a basis for their behavior—information that does not take into account recent events. The first model of sticky information was developed by Stanley Fischer in his 1977 article. He adopted a &quot;staggered&quot; or &quot;overlapping&quot; contract model. Suppose that there are two unions in the economy, who take turns to choose wages. When it is a union&#x27;s turn, it chooses the wages it will set for the next two periods. In contrast to John B. Taylor&#x27;s model where the nominal wage is constant over the contract life, in Fischer&#x27;s model the union can choose a different wage for each period over the contract. The key point is that at any time t, the union setting its new contract will be using the up-to-date latest information to choose its wages for the next two periods. However, the other union is still setting its wage based on the contract it planned last period, which is based on the old information.

The importance of sticky information in Fischer&#x27;s model is that whilst wages in some sectors of the economy are reacting to the latest information, those in other sectors are not. This has important implications for monetary policy. A sudden change in monetary policy can have real effects, because of the sector where wages have not had a chance to adjust to the new information.

The idea of sticky information was later developed by N. Gregory Mankiw and Ricardo Reis. This added a new feature to Fischer&#x27;s model: there is a fixed probability that one can replan one&#x27;s wages or prices each period. Using quarterly data, they assumed a value of 25%: that is, each quarter 25% of randomly chosen firms/unions can plan a trajectory of current and future prices based on current information. Thus if we consider the current period, 25% of prices will be based on the latest information available, and the rest on information that was available when they last were able to replan their price trajectory. Mankiw and Reis found that the model of sticky information provided a good way of explaining inflation persistence.

===Evaluation of sticky information models===

Sticky information models do not have nominal rigidity: firms or unions are free to choose different prices or wages for each period. It is the information that is sticky, not the prices. Thus when a firm gets lucky and can re-plan its current and future prices, it will choose a trajectory of what it believes will be the optimal prices now and in the future. In general, this will involve setting a different price every period covered by the plan.

This is at odds with the empirical evidence on prices. There are now many studies of price rigidity in different countries: the US, the Eurozone, the UK and others. These studies all show that whilst there are some sectors where prices change frequently, there are also other sectors where prices remain fixed over time. The lack of sticky prices in the sticky information model is inconsistent with the behavior of prices in most of the economy. This has led to attempts to formulate a &quot;dual stickiness&quot; model that combines sticky information with sticky prices.

===Sticky inflation assumption===

The sticky inflation assumption states that &quot;when firms set prices, for various reasons the prices respond slowly to changes in monetary policy. This leads the rate of inflation to adjust gradually over time.&quot;
Additionally, within the context of the short run model there is an implication that the classical dichotomy does not hold when sticky inflation is present. This is the case when monetary policy affects real variables. Sticky inflation can be caused by expected inflation (e.g. home prices prior to the recession), wage push inflation (a negotiated raise in wages), and temporary inflation caused by taxes. Sticky inflation becomes a problem when economic output decreases while inflation increases, which is also known as stagflation. As economic output decreases and unemployment rises the standard of living falls faster when sticky inflation is present. Not only will inflation not respond to monetary policy in the short run, but monetary expansion as well as contraction can both have negative effects on the standard of living.

<text>Prevlaka () is a small peninsula in southern Croatia, near the border with Montenegro, at the entrance to the Bay of Kotor on the eastern Adriatic coast.

Because of its strategic location in the southern Adriatic, in the aftermath of the SFR Yugoslav breakup, the peninsula became subject to a territorial dispute between Croatia and FR Yugoslavia, a federal state that included Montenegro. The territory was functional under UN until 2002. The UN mission ended in December 2002 and the territory that had previously been part of SR Croatia was returned to the Republic of Croatia. An agreement was signed by both sides five days before the departure of the UNMOP that demilitarized Prevlaka, though implementation still has a temporary character.

==Geography==
The narrow, uninhabited peninsula is long and only wide, covering an area of (just under ).

The word &quot;prevlaka&quot; means &#x27;portage&#x27;. Cape Oštro (Punta Oštro/Punta d&#x27;Ostro), located at the very tip of the peninsula, is the southernmost point of mainland in Croatia. Along with the small Montenegrin island of Mamula, which sits some east of Cape Oštro, in addition to being two sides of an international maritime border, the two spots present observation entry points into the Bay of Kotor.

North of the Prevlaka isthmus, just within the Bay of Kotor, lie the two less prominent capes Konfin and Kobila, to the northwest of which is a road border crossing between Croatia and Montenegro. The D516 highway connects it to Konavle and the D8; northwards the road connects to Njivice, Sutorina, and Igalo.

==History==

Konavle and the Prevlaka peninsula was bought by the Republic of Ragusa from the Bosnian Kingdom in the early 15th century to protect its eastern flank. Ragusans fortified Cape Oštro in 1441. Cape Kobila was the boundary with Sutorina under the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s control since 1699.

In 1806, during Napoleon&#x27;s conquest of Europe, King Alexander I of Russia was intent on stopping French advances in the Adriatic and to that end deployed a Mediterranean expedition led by vice-admiral Dmitry Senyavin, that by September 1806 made considerable territorial gains in the area, including Prevlaka and the entire Bay of Kotor. In July 1807, the Russians and the French struck a deal in the first Treaty of Tilsit for the area to be handed over to the First French Empire. In 1808, the French assigned the newly acquired territory over to their client state called the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy before in 1810 reassigning it back into the First French Empire proper as part of the Illyrian Provinces, their recently created autonomous subdivision.

Following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, former Ragusan territory including Prevlaka came under the rule of the Austrian Empire in 1813. Austrian rule was ratified by the Congress of Vienna in 1815, and the territory became part of its newly created internal administrative subdivision, the Kingdom of Dalmatia. It remained as such after the transformation of Austrian Empire into the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary following the Congress of Berlin in 1867. Towards the end of the 19th century, on the suggestion of General Lazar Mamula, the Austro-Hungarian authorities decided to build a fort on Punta d&#x27;Ostro, along with another in the island of Mamula in order to ensure military control over the entrance into the Bay of Kotor. The Austrian authorities successfully fortified cape Mirište and the islet of Mamula. The authorities reportedly also decided to compensate local farmers for the expropriated land, but no money was paid until the collapse of the dual monarchy.

In 1918, after the end of World War I and collapse of Austria-Hungary, Prevlaka became part of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. By 1922, once the new state determined its internal administrative subdivisions, dividing its territory into 33 oblasts, the peninsula got included in kingdom&#x27;s Dubrovnik Oblast. In 1929, as Kingdom of SCS transformed into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia along with its internal administrative subdivisions being reconfigured into 9 banovinas, Prevlaka was included into Zeta Banovina together with Dubrovnik. During the 1930s, Royal Yugoslav Army further fortified Prevlaka. In 1939, the area was assigned to the newly created Banovina of Croatia subdivision of the Yugoslav kingdom.

World War II was the only period since the 15th century when the boundaries of Konavle were modified. In April 1941 Nazi Germany invaded Yugoslavia, conquering it in less than three weeks before proceeding to dismember its territory by creating a handful of locally-administered fascist puppet states. Due to its strategic importance, the Axis-aligned Kingdom of Italy under prime minister Benito Mussolini would not let either of the two newly propped up local fascist puppet regimes, the Independent State of Croatia or the Italian governorate of Montenegro, control the Bay of Kotor region. The Bay of Kotor along with its surrounding areas including eastern Konavle and Prevlaka was controlled directly by Italy based on the May 1941 Treaties of Rome.

As World War II dragged on, in summer 1943, in response to the Allied advances in their Italian campaign, Nazi Germany took over the administration of the Bay of Kotor including Prevlaka. On 22 December 1944, the Yugoslav Partisans took control of the region, and after the war Prevlaka became part of the newly proclaimed FPR Yugoslavia, specifically its constituent unit the People&#x27;s Republic of Croatia.

In 1955, the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) closed down access to Prevlaka because of its coastal artillery installations.

During the Yugoslav Wars that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia, the territory was occupied by Yugoslav forces like most of the Dubrovnik region during the siege of Dubrovnik. At one point, the Croatian military gained temporary control over Prevlaka, before it was retaken. The two sides agreed on the demilitarization of the peninsula and the United Nations Security Council Resolution 779 of October 6, 1992 extended the mandate of UNPROFOR to the implementation of this agreement, together with the European Community Monitoring Mission. A resolution to the conflict took shape in 1996 when the United Nations mediated the conflict and established an observer mission (UNMOP) which oversaw the demilitarization and acted as a buffer.

The Konfin/Kobila border crossing has operated since 1999.

The UN mission ended in December 2002 and the territory that had previously been part of SR Croatia was returned to the Republic of Croatia. An agreement was signed by both sides five days before the departure of the UNMOP that demilitarized Prevlaka, though implementation still has a temporary character.

In 2002, the two states agreed on a temporary solution stipulating that Croatia would receive the entire land mass of the Prevlaka peninsula including some of the sea belt entrance into Boka Kotorska while the sea bay on the side of Prevlaka facing Herceg Novi was declared no man&#x27;s waters.

Montenegro became independent in 2006 and the temporary agreement remained in effect. In 2008, a mixed commission was created, tasked with preparing the legal case for the border settlement in front of the International Court of Justice at The Hague. In search of the permanent border settlement, the two states have the option of settling the issue between themselves bilaterally or opting for the international arbitration.

<text>Savitri Devi Mukherji (born Maximiani Julia Portas, ; 30 September 1905 – 22 October 1982) was a French-born Greek-Italian fascist, Nazi sympathizer, and spy who served the Axis powers by committing acts of espionage against the Allied forces in India. She was later a leading member of the Neo-Nazi underground during the 1960s.

Savitri was a proponent of a synthesis of Hinduism and Nazism, proclaiming Adolf Hitler to have been an avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu. She depicted Hitler as a sacrifice for humanity that would lead to the end of the worst World Age, the Kali Yuga, which she believed was induced by the Jews, whom she saw as the powers of evil.

Her writings have influenced neo-Nazism and Nazi occultism. Rejecting Judaism and Christianity, she believed in a form of pantheistic monism, a single cosmos of nature composed of divine energy-matter. Within neo-Nazism, she promoted occultism and ecology, and her works have influenced the alt-right. She also influenced the Chilean diplomat Miguel Serrano. In 1982, Franco Freda published a German translation of her work &quot;Gold in the Furnace&quot;, and the fourth volume of his annual review, &quot;Risguardo&quot; (1980–), was devoted to Savitri Devi as the &quot;missionary of Aryan Paganism&quot;.

Savitri was an associate in the post-war years of Françoise Dior, Otto Skorzeny, Johann von Leers, and Hans-Ulrich Rudel. She was also one of the founding members of the World Union of National Socialists.

==Early years==
Born as Maximiani Julia Portas in 1905 in Lyon, Savitri Devi was the daughter of Maxim Portas, a French citizen of Greek descent and an English woman of Italian descent, Julia Portas (née Nash). Maximiani Portas was born two and a half months premature, weighing only , and was not at first expected to live. She formed her political views early. From childhood and throughout her life, she was a passionate advocate for animal rights. Her earliest political affiliations were with Greek nationalism.

Portas studied philosophy and chemistry, earning two master&#x27;s degrees and a PhD in philosophy from the University of Lyon. She next traveled to Greece, and surveyed the legendary ruins. Here, she became familiar with Heinrich Schliemann&#x27;s discovery of swastikas in Anatolia. Her conclusion was that the Ancient Greeks were Aryan in origin. Her first two books were her doctoral dissertations: &quot;Essai-critique sur Théophile Kaïris&quot; (&quot;Critical Essay on Theophilos Kairis&quot;) (Lyon: Maximine Portaz, 1935) and &quot;La simplicité mathématique&quot; (&quot;Mathematical Simplicity&quot;) (Lyon: Maximine Portaz, 1935).

===Nazism===
In early 1928, she renounced her French citizenship and acquired Greek nationality. Joining a pilgrimage to The British Mandate of Palestine during Lent in 1929, Portas decided that she was a Nazi.

In 1932, she traveled to India in search of a living pagan Aryan culture, believing that the country represented &quot;the best of racial segregation.&quot; Formally adhering to Hinduism, she took the name Savitri Devi (Hindi: सावित्री देवी; which means &quot;Sun-rays Goddess&quot; in Sanskrit). She volunteered to work at the Hindu Mission as an advocate against Judaism and Christianity, and wrote &quot;A Warning to the Hindus&quot; in order to offer her support for Hindu nationalism and independence, and rally resistance to the spread of Christianity and Islam in India. During the 1930s, she distributed pro-Axis propaganda and engaged in intelligence gathering on the British in India. She claimed that, during World War II, she enabled Subhas Chandra Bose (the leader of the Axis-affiliated Indian National Army) to contact representatives of the Empire of Japan.

===World War II===

During World War II, Devi&#x27;s connection to the Axis powers led to a clash with her mother, who served with the French Resistance during the German occupation of France. In 1940, Devi married Asit Krishna Mukherji, a Bengali Brahmin with Nazi views who edited the pro-German newspaper &quot;New Mercury&quot;. During 1941, Devi chose to interpret Allied military support for Greece, against Italian and German forces, as an invasion of Greece. Devi and Mukherji lived in Calcutta and continued to gather intelligence for the Axis cause. This included entertaining Allied personnel, which gave Devi and Mukherji an opportunity to question them about military matters. The information which they gathered was passed on to Japanese intelligence officials and the Japanese military found it useful when they launched attacks against Allied airbases and army units.

==Post-war Nazi activism==
After World War II, she travelled to Europe in late 1945 under the name Savitri Devi Mukherji as the wife of a British subject from India, with a British Indian passport. She briefly stopped in England, then she visited her mother in France, with whom she would quarrel over the latter&#x27;s support for the French Resistance. She then traveled to Iceland, where she witnessed the eruption of Mount Hekla on 5–6 April 1947. She briefly returned to England, then she traveled to Sweden, where she met Sven Hedin.

On 15 June 1948, she boarded the Nord-Express and traveled from Denmark to Germany, where she distributed thousands of copies of handwritten leaflets in which she encouraged the &quot;Men and women of Germany&quot; to &quot;hold fast to our glorious National Socialist faith, and resist!&quot; She recounted her experience in &quot;Gold in the Furnace&quot; (which was re-edited and released as &quot;Gold in the Furnace: Experiences in Post-War Germany&quot; to coincide with the hundredth anniversary of her birth).

Arrested for posting bills, she was tried in Düsseldorf on 5 April 1949 for the promotion of Nazi ideas on German territory as a subject of the Allied Control Council, and sentenced to three years imprisonment. She served time in Werl Prison, where she befriended her fellow Nazi and SS prisoners (recounted in &quot;Defiance&quot;), before she was released early in August 1949 and expelled from Germany. She then went to stay in Lyon, France.

In April 1953, she obtained a Greek passport in her maiden name in order to re-enter Germany, and while she was there, she went on a pilgrimage, as she called it, to Nazi &quot;holy&quot; sites. She flew from Athens to Rome and then she traveled by rail over the Brenner Pass into &quot;Greater Germany&quot;, which she regarded as &quot;the spiritual home of all racially conscious modern Aryans&quot;. She traveled to a number of sites which were significant in the life of Adolf Hitler and the history of the Nazi Party (NSDAP), as well as German nationalist and heathen monuments, as recounted in her 1958 book &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;.

Savitri Devi became a friend of Hans-Ulrich Rudel, and she completed her manuscript of &quot;The Lightning and the Sun&quot; at his home in March 1956. Through his introductions, she was able to meet a number of Nazi émigrés in Spain and the Middle East. In 1957, she visited Johann von Leers in Egypt and traveled across the Middle East before she returned to her home in New Delhi, making stops in Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad, Tehran, and Zahedan. In 1961 she stayed with Otto Skorzeny in Madrid.

Savitri Devi took employment teaching in France during the 1960s, spending her summer holidays with friends at Berchtesgaden. In the spring of 1961, while she was on her Easter holiday in London, she learned about the existence of the original British National Party. This group emerged after the Second World War when a handful of former members of the British Union of Fascists took on the name. (The original BNP was quickly absorbed into the Union Movement – it has no direct connection to the present-day BNP.) She met the British National Party&#x27;s president Andrew Fountaine. Beginning a correspondence with Colin Jordan, she became a devoted supporter of the National Socialist Movement.

In August 1962, Savitri Devi attended the international Nazi conference in Gloucestershire and she was also a founder-signatory of the Cotswold Agreement which established the World Union of National Socialists (WUNS). At this conference she met, and was greatly impressed by, George Lincoln Rockwell. When Rockwell became the leader of the WUNS, he appointed William Luther Pierce the editor of its new magazine: &quot;National Socialist World&quot; (1966–68). Along with articles by Jordan and Rockwell, Pierce devoted nearly eighty pages of the first issue of the magazine to a condensed edition of &quot;The Lightning and the Sun&quot;. Because of the enthusiastic response, Pierce included chapters from &quot;Gold in the Furnace&quot; and &quot;Defiance&quot; in subsequent issues.

After retiring from teaching in 1970, Savitri Devi spent nine months at the Normandy home of her close friend Françoise Dior while she was working on her memoirs; although she was welcome at first, her annoying personal habits began to disrupt life at the presbytery (among her habits, she did not take baths during her stay and she continually chewed garlic). Concluding that her pension would go much further in India and encouraged by Françoise Dior, she flew from Paris to Bombay on 23 June 1971. In August, she moved to New Delhi, where she lived alone, with a number of cats and at least one cobra.

Savitri Devi continued to correspond with Nazi enthusiasts in Europe and the Americas, particularly with Colin Jordan, John Tyndall, Matt Koehl, Miguel Serrano, Einar Åberg and Ernst Zündel. She was the first person to tell Zündel of her claim that the Nazi genocide of the Jews was untrue; he proposed a series of taped interviews (conducted in November 1978) and published a new illustrated edition of &quot;The Lightning and the Sun&quot; in 1979.

==Animal rights activism==
Devi was an animal rights activist, as well as a vegetarian from a young age, and she also espoused ecologist views in her works. She wrote &quot;The Impeachment of Man&quot; in 1959 in India in which she espoused her views on animal rights and nature. According to her, human beings do not stand above the animals; in her ecologist views, humans are a part of the ecosystem and as a result, they should respect all life, including animals and the whole of nature.

She always held radical views with regard to vegetarianism and believed that people who do not &quot;respect nature or animals&quot; should be executed. She also believed that vivisection, circuses, slaughter and fur industries among others do not belong in a civilized society.

==Death==
By the late 1970s, she had developed cataracts and her eyesight was rapidly deteriorating as a result. Myriam Hirn, a clerk from the French embassy in India, looked after her, making regular house visits. She decided to leave India, returning to Germany to live in Bavaria in 1981 before moving back to France in 1982.

Savitri died in 1982 in Sible Hedingham, Essex, England, at a friend&#x27;s home. The cause of her death was recorded as a heart attack and coronary thrombosis. She was &quot;en route&quot; to lecture in the United States at the invitation of Matthias Koehl at the time of her death. Her body was cremated in a simple ceremony in Colchester, Essex which was attended by Tony Williams as well as two young British Nazis. Devi&#x27;s ashes were shipped in an inscribed urn to the headquarters of the American Nazi Party in Arlington, Virginia, where they were then taken and purportedly placed by Matt Koehl next to those of George Lincoln Rockwell in a &quot;Nazi hall of honor&quot; in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

<text>The Jonang () is a school of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism. Its origins in Tibet can be traced to the early 12th century master Yumo Mikyo Dorje. It became widely known through the work of the popular 14th century figure Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen. The Jonang school&#x27;s main practice is the &quot;Kālacakra tantra&quot; (&quot;Wheel of Time Tantra&quot;), and they are widely known for their defense of the philosophy known as shentong (&quot;empty of other&quot;).

After a period of influence, the Jonang tradition suffered a series of reversals, partly due to its suppression by the politically dominant Gelug school under the Fifth Dalai Lama in the 17th century. Jonang did survive in Amdo, from which they eventually re-established themselves in other regions like Golok, Nakhi, and Kham. They have continued practicing uninterrupted to this day. An estimated 5,000 monks and nuns of the Jonang tradition practice today in these areas. However, their teachings were limited to these regions until the Rimé movement of the 19th century encouraged the study of non-Gelug traditions of Tibetan Buddhism.

The Jonang shentong view was influential on various figures in other Tibetan Buddhist schools, including the 3rd Karmapa Rangjung Dorje (1284–1339), the eighth Tai Situpa (1700–1774), Katok Tsewang Norbu (1698–1755), Situ Panchen (1700–1774), Jamgön Kongtrül (1813–1899), Kalu Rinpoche (1905–1989), and Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso (1934–2024).

==History==

=== Development ===
The monk Künpang Tukjé Tsöndrü (, 1243–1313) established a kumbum or stupa-vihara in the Jomonang Valley about northwest of the Tashilhunpo Monastery in Ü-Tsang (modern Shigatse). The Jonang tradition took its name from this &quot;Jomonang&quot; monastery, where Tsöndrü established a practice tradition that integrated seventeen different transmission of the Kālacakra Tantra completion stage yogas, and which was significantly expanded by later figures, including Dolpopa.

The Jonang tradition combines two specific teachings, what has come to be known as the philosophy of shentong (&quot;empty of other&quot;) madhyamaka, and the Dro lineage of the &quot;Kalachakra Tantra.&quot; The origin of this combination in Tibet is traced to the master Yumo Mikyö Dorjé (c. 11th-12th century), a pupil of the Kashmiri master Somanātha, whose treatises compiled sources emphasizing the unique approach to emptiness of the Kalachakra Tantra.

The shentong view holds that the non-dual nature of the mind (the buddha-nature) is real (and &quot;not&quot; empty of inherent existence), while all other phenomena &quot;are&quot; empty in this way. The buddha-nature can be described empty, but not of its own-nature, rather it is empty of all defiled and illusory phenomena. Thus, in Jonang, the emptiness of ultimate reality should not be characterized in the same way as the emptiness of relative phenomena. This is because ultimate reality is a stream of luminosity (&quot;prabhāsvara-saṃtāna),&quot; endowed with limitless Buddha qualities. It is empty of all that is false, not empty of the limitless Buddha qualities that are its innate nature.

The key figure in Jonang is Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (1292–1361), a great yogi and scholar who widely promoted the philosophy of shentong. He was initially educated at Sakya monastery, and he also studied Kagyu and Nyingma lineages. He was very impressed by the yogis of Jonang Monastery and eventually studied there under Khetsun Yonten Gyatso (1260–1327), receiving a complete transmission of the Jonang &quot;Kālacakra&quot; tradition. After some years in meditative retreat, Dolpopa assumed the leadership of Jonang monastery. Over the years, Dolpopa became extremely popular and was invited to teach throughout Tibet. He wrote various influential works on the shentong philosophy.

=== Post-Dolpopa era and suppression ===
After Dolpopa&#x27;s time, the Jonang school generated a number of renowned Buddhist scholars, its most famous being Lama Tāranātha (1575–1634), who placed great emphasis on the &quot;Kālacakra Tantra&quot;, Sanskrit study and the history of Indian Buddhism. Tāranātha studied under various figures, such as Je Draktopa, Yeshe Wangpo, Kunga Tashi and Jampa Lhundrup, but his main teacher was the mahāsiddha Buddhaguptanātha.
In the 17th century, the Gelug school became the dominant political force in Tibet, which was now ruled by the Dalai Lamas. The Gelug school worked to suppress the Jonang school and its distinct philosophy of shentong. Modern historians have identified two other reasons which more likely led the Gelugpa to suppress the Jonangpa. First, the Jonangpa had political ties that were very vexing to the Gelugpa. The Jonang school, along with the Kagyu, were historical allies with the powerful house of Tsangpa, which was vying with the 5th Dalai Lama and the Gelug school for control of Central Tibet.

This was bad enough, but soon after the death of Taranatha, an even more ominous event occurred. Taranatha&#x27;s tulku was discovered to be a young boy named Zanabazar, the son of Tüsheet Khan, Prince of Central Khalkha. Tüsheet Khan and his son were of Borjigin lineage (the imperial clan of Genghis Khan and his successors), meaning they had the birth authority to become khagan. When the young boy was declared the spiritual leader of all of Mongolia, suddenly the Gelugpa were faced with the possibility of war with the former military superpower of Asia. While the Mongol Empire was long past its zenith, this was nonetheless a frightening prospect and the Dalai Lama sought the first possible moment of Mongol distraction to take control of the Jonang monasteries.

As a result of the suppression of Jonang, the writings of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen and even those of Sakya proponents of shentong (like Sakya Chokden) were sealed and banned from publication and study. Jonang monasteries were also gradually converted to the Gelug lineage by the political authorities.

The 14th Dalai Lama has also said that the main reason for the suppression of Jonang was political, not religious sectarianism (since the 5th Dalai Lama was himself a student of numerous lineages, including Bon).

=== Survival and revival ===
The Jonang tradition was able to survive in Amdo where a couple of monasteries had been founded in ’Dzam thang and rGyal rong. From here Jonang was able to spread to other regions like Golog and Ngawa. Dzamtang Tsangwa dzong (in Zamtang County, Sichuan), established by Ngag dbang bstan ’dzin rnam rgyal (1691–1728), eventually became the school&#x27;s main seat. Due to the efforts of figures like Ngag dbang blo gros grags pa (1920–1975) and Ngag dbang yon tan bzang po (1928–2002), about fifty Jonang monasteries survived the cultural revolution.

The Jonang school also experienced a revival in the modern era during the Rime period. Important modern Jonang scholars include Bamda Gelek Gyatso (1844–1904), Tsoknyi Gyatso (1880–1940), Ngawang Lodro Drakpa (1920–75), Kunga Tukje Palsang (1925–2000) and Ngawang Yonten Sangpo (1928–2002). Modern Jonang figures also had close relationships with masters of the non-sectarian (Rime) movement such as Jamgon Kongtrul (1813–1899) and Patrul Rinpoche (1808–1887) and these Rime figures also visited and studied at Dzamtang. 
Until recently little was known about the survival of Jonang until Tibetologists discovered around 40 monasteries, with around 5000 monks, including some in the Amdo Tibetan and rGyalgrong areas of Qinghai, Sichuan and Tibet.

One of the primary supporters of the Jonang lineage in exile has been the 14th Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama donated buildings in Himachal Pradesh state in Shimla, India for use as a Jonang monastery (now known as the Main Takten Phuntsok Choeling Monastery) and has visited during one of his recent teaching tours. The Karmapa of the Karma Kagyu lineage has also visited.

The Jonang tradition has been actively petitioning for the past 20+ years to the Tibetan Government in exile, requesting them to recognize the Jonang as the sixth living Buddhist tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, and seek equal religious rights and representation to the Bon, Nyingma, Sakya, Kagyu and Gelug. The 14th Dalai Lama assigned Jebtsundamba Khutuktu of Mongolia (who is considered by the Gelug tradition to be an incarnation of Tāranātha) as the leader of the Jonang tradition.

More recently, the Jonang school has been growing in the West (led by teachers like Khentrul Jamphel Lodrö Rinpoché and Khenpo Chokyi Nangwa) and among the Chinese (led by teachers like Tulku Jamyang Lodrö and mKhan po Chos kyi dbang phyug).

==Texts==
Much of the Tibetan literature of the Jonang has survived, including the &quot;Ocean of Definitive Meaning: A Teaching for the Mountain Hermit&quot; (commonly referred to as &quot;Mountain Dharma&quot;)&quot;,&quot; an extensive presentation of the ground, path, and fruit from the shentong perspective by Dolpopa.

=== Mahayana sutras of definitive meaning ===

==== Tathagatagarbha sutras ====
According to Dolpopa, his main sources for the ultimate truth and definitive meaning (nītārtha) are the &quot;tathagatagarbha sutras,&quot; the most important of which are the following:
* &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Sutra on the Tathagata Essence&quot;, Tib. )
* &quot;Avikalpapraveśadhāraṇī&quot; (&quot;Dharani for Entering the Nonconceptual&quot;; Tib. )
* &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Sutra of the Lions Roar of Srimaladevi&quot;)
* &quot;Mahābherīsūtra&quot; (&quot;Sutra of the Great Drum&quot;)
* &quot;Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Sutra to Benefit Angulimala&quot;)
* &quot;Śūnyatānāmamahāsūtra&quot; (&quot;Sutra of Great Emptiness&quot;)
* &quot;Tathāgatamahākaruṇānirdeśasūtra (Sutra Presenting the Great Compassion of the Tathagata),&quot; also known as the &quot;Dhāraṇīśvararājasūtra&quot;
* &quot;Tathāgataguṇajñānācintyaviṣayāvatāranirdeśasūtra&quot; (&quot;Sutra Presenting the Inconceivable Qualities and Primordial Awareness of the Tathagata&quot;)
* &quot;Mahāmeghasūtra&quot; (&quot;Extensive Sutra of the Great Cloud&quot;)
* &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Sutra of Great Final Nirvana&quot;), which exists in two Tibetan versions, a condensed and an extensive version.

==== Sutras of Definite Meaning ====
Another Jonang list of sutras of definitive meaning, i.e. which teach the ultimate truth, not the relative or provisional meaning (neyārtha) for the Jonang traditions is the following:
* &quot;Pañcaśatikā-prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Perfection of Wisdom in 500 Lines&quot;)
* the “Maitreya Chapter” (&quot;Maitreya&#x27;s Questions&quot; is a chapter found in two versions of the Tibetan &quot;Large Prajñaparamita sutra,&quot; the 18,000 line and the 25,000 line versions&quot;.&quot;) 
* &quot;Ghanavyūha Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Dense Array Sutra&quot;)
* &quot;Praśāntaviniścayaprātihāryanāmasamādhisūtra&quot; (&quot;Sutra on Utterly Quiescent and Certain Magical Meditative Concentrations&quot;) 
* &quot;Ratnameghasūtra&quot; (&quot;Clouds of Jewels Sutra&quot;)
* &quot;Suvarṇaprabhāsottamasūtra&quot; (&quot;Golden Light Sutra&quot;)
* &quot;Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra (Explanation of the Profound Secrets Sutra)&quot;
* &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra (Descent into Laṅka Sutra)&quot;
* &quot;Sarvabuddha-viṣayāvatāra-jñānālokālaṃkāra Sūtra&quot;
* &quot;Buddhāvataṃsakasūtra&quot;

=== Tantric sources ===
The most important Buddhist tantra in the Jonang tradition is the &quot;Kālacakra tantra.&quot;

Regarding tantric commentaries, Jonang relies on &quot;The Bodhisattva Trilogy&quot; (sems &#x27;grel skor gsum), which comprises the following three texts: The &quot;Vimalaprabhā&quot; (an 11th-century Indian commentary on the &quot;Kalacakra tantra&quot;), the &quot;Hevajrapiṇḍārthaṭīkā&quot; (Toh 1180, a commentary on the &quot;Hevajra tantra&quot; in 6000 lines), and the &quot;Laksabhidhanaduddhrtalaghutantrapindarthavivarana&quot; (Toh 1402), a commentary on the &quot;Chakrasamvara tantra&quot; by Vajrapani.

=== Key śāstras ===
The Jonang tradition also relies on several important Indian and Tibetan śāstras (treatises), including:
* The works of Nagarjuna, especially his &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;
* The Five Maitreya Texts: &quot;Abhisamayalankara,&quot; &quot;Mahayanasutralankara,&quot; &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga,&quot; &quot;Dharmadharmatavibhanga,&quot; &quot;Madhyantavibhanga&quot;
* The works of Dolpopa, especially his &quot;Ocean of Definitive Meaning: A Teaching for the Mountain Hermit (&quot;Wylie: &quot;ri chos nges don rgya mtsho)&quot; and his &quot;Great Calculation of the Doctrine that have the Significance of a Fourth Council.&quot; His &quot;A General Explanation of Buddha’s Teaching&quot; was his first work on the view of “Empty of Other,” elucidating the core meaning of Buddhism.
* The works of Taranatha, especially his &quot;The Essence of Other-Emptiness, Meaningful to Behold (Mthong ba don ldan)&quot; and his &quot;Commentary on the Heart Sutra.&quot;

<doc id="526822" wikidata="Q5111539" url="?curid=526822" title="Christmas on Mars">
<text>Christmas on Mars is a 2008 independent psychological science fiction film from the alternative rock band the Flaming Lips, written and directed by the band&#x27;s frontman, Wayne Coyne, and featuring the entire band in the cast, as well as many of their associates, including Steve Burns, Adam Goldberg, and Fred Armisen.

The film began development in 2001, filming was completed in October 2005, and the film premiered on May 25, 2008 at the Sasquatch! Music Festival. For its general release in the United States, &quot;Christmas on Mars&quot; was booked into several dozen cities for unconventional screenings, in venues which included a former Ukrainian Socialist Social Club in New York City. The film was released in three different packages on November 11, 2008 through conventional retailers as well as through the band&#x27;s website. A vinyl edition was released November 25, 2008.

== Plot ==
The film tells the story of the experiences of Major Syrtis during the first Christmas on a newly colonized Mars.

The main character, Major Syrtis (played by Steven Drozd), is trying to organize a Christmas pageant to celebrate the birth of the first colonist baby. The hype they&#x27;ve added to this Mars mission is that this beautiful woman is giving birth to a baby from an artificial impregnation from the bubble she wears on her stomach. It&#x27;s all scientifically timed, so she gives birth to this baby the second it hits midnight on Christmas. It is symbolically the beginning of a new civilization. But instead of being born from religious ideas, it&#x27;s from a scientific idea.

A Martian that lands, but the Martian isn&#x27;t really perceived as a Martian. People think he&#x27;s another crazy guy who&#x27;s flipped and turned himself green. They can&#x27;t find a quick replacement for Santa, so they use this Martian guy. The Martian guy becomes the Martian and Santa Claus simultaneously.

== Cast ==

*Steven Drozd as Major Syrtis
*Wayne Coyne as the Alien Super-Being
*Michael Ivins as Deuteronilus
*Kliph Scurlock as Orcus
*Steve Burns as Astronaut
*Scott Booker as Sirenum
*Adam Goldberg as Dr. Scott Zero
*Fred Armisen as Noachis
*Mark Degraffenreid as Captain Icaria
*Jimmy Pike as Jim Eleven
*Kenny Coyne as Ed Fifteen

;Cast notes:
*Contrary to early reports, Isaac Brock of Modest Mouse and Elijah Wood do not appear in the film&#x27;s final cut. However, a scene with Isaac Brock and Adam Goldberg exists on the DVD as an Easter egg.

== Production ==
At the beginning of 2002, over 20 minutes of edited film were ready, with music and preliminary sound effects also completed for these scenes. Most of the movie was shot on 16 mm film, with most of the sets based in Wayne&#x27;s Oklahoma City house. Most scenes were filmed in and around Oklahoma City, using locations such as old industrial facilities. Further filming was done in Boston, Texas.

== Release ==
Originally, &quot;Christmas on Mars&quot; was not to be released at conventional movie theaters. Instead, a DVD release would be preceded by a number of screenings at rock venues. Speaking to mtv.com, Coyne has explained &quot;We want to show the movie with a mega-sound system and snow machines and just make it like a bigger event than what has become the typical movie-going experience. I&#x27;m hoping that people can watch this movie while they drink beer, smoke cigarettes, and have a good time.&quot;

By October 2007, the film was in the final editing stage and the band was also transferring it to HD and adding &quot;in-depth special effects.&quot; On September 12, 2008, the film made its New York City debut at 7am within the KGB Complex, a former Ukrainian Socialist Social Club, on the Lower East Side.

== DVD ==
The film was released on DVD November 11, 2008 in three different packages designed by the band&#x27;s visual generalist George Salisbury. One is a conventional DVD available at conventional retailers. There is also a deluxe edition containing the film on DVD in addition to a soundtrack CD. The Mega Deluxe Edition includes: The Film and Soundtrack (in special Deluxe Edition packaging), an exclusive T-shirt, a collectible movie ticket replicating those used during the rock festival tour, trading cards featuring all four members of the band from the movie on one side and performing on stage on the other, an &quot;Eat Your Own Spaceship&quot; bumper sticker, and a box of &quot;Flaming Lips&quot; popcorn featuring Wayne as the Martian. The first 1,000 Mega Deluxe Edition versions will have the popcorn boxes signed by all four members of the Flaming Lips. Of those 1,000 copies ten will contain a &quot;golden ticket&quot; good for two tickets to the Lips annual New Year&#x27;s Eve concert in Oklahoma City. The vinyl edition is slated for release on November 25, 2008. The DVD contains at least one easter egg.

== Soundtrack ==
Two tracks from the movie soundtrack, &quot;Protonilus Death March&quot; and &quot;Syrtis Major&quot; were released as a 5000-only picture-disc EP late in 2004, available only through the band&#x27;s online store in conjunction with the purchase of their limited-edition pictorial biography &quot;Waking Up With a Placebo Headwound&quot;. &quot;Syrtis Major&quot; and another soundtrack cut, &quot;Xanthe Terra&quot;, were also released as B-sides to the 2-part European single release of &quot;Do You Realize??&quot; These songs are both entirely instrumental, in a similar style to acclaimed Lips instrumentals such as the Grammy-winning Approaching Pavonis Mons by Balloon (Utopia Planitia). For the final soundtrack release, &quot;Protonilus Death March&quot; has been renamed to &quot;The Gleaming Armament of Marching Genitalia,&quot; &quot;Syrtis Major&quot; is now &quot;Space Bible With Volume Lumps&quot; and &quot;Xanthe Terra&quot; is now &quot;Suicide and Extraordinary Mistakes.&quot;

<doc id="526824" wikidata="Q325712" url="?curid=526824" title="Milwaukee Art Museum">
<text>The Milwaukee Art Museum (also referred to as MAM) is an art museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Its collection of over 34,000 works of art and gallery spaces totaling 150,000 sq. ft. (13,900 m²) make it the largest art museum in the state of Wisconsin and one of the largest art museums in the United States.

The Milwaukee Art Museum emerged from the reunion of two prior art institutions, the Layton Art Gallery and the Milwaukee Art Institute, both established in 1888. In 1957, they combined their collections inside the newly-completed Milwaukee County War Memorial designed by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, forming the Milwaukee Arts Center (renamed Milwaukee Art Museum in 1980). Subsequent expansions included the David Kahler Building in 1975, the Quadracci Pavilion by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, inaugurated in 2001, and the East End entrance, opened in 2015.

Among highlights of the collection are paintings by American artists of the Ashcan School, American and European decorative arts, 19th-century German art and early-20th-century German Expressionist art, as well as folk and Haitian art. The museum also holds one of the largest collections of works by Wisconsin-born artist Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe in the United States.

In 2024, the Milwaukee Art Museum was ranked 8th best art museum in the country by the readers and editors of USA Today, one of the largest US newspapers by number of subscribers and print circulation.

== Location and visit ==
Located on the lakefront of Lake Michigan, the Milwaukee Art Museum is one of the largest art museums in the Midwestern United States. Aside from its galleries, the museum includes a cafe, named Cafe Calatrava, and a gift shop.

=== Hours ===
Normal operating hours for MAM are Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and Thursday 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. The museum is closed Mondays and Tuesdays.

==History==

===Origins to the 1960s===
Beginning around 1870, multiple organizations were founded in order to bring an art gallery to Milwaukee, as the city was still a growing port town with few or no facilities to hold major art exhibitions. All attempts to build a major art gallery failed despite the presence of active art collectors in town, such as banker Alexander Mitchell, and manufacturers William Henry Metcalf and Charles Allis.

In 1883, local businessman Frederick Layton, a British immigrant who made his fortune through wholesale, meatpacking, and railroad ventures in Wisconsin, suggested establishing an art gallery for the city of Milwaukee. He commissioned Scottish architect George Ashdown Audsley, of the firm W. &amp; G. Audsley, to design the building later known as the Layton Art Gallery. Audsley&#x27;s Greek Revival, one-story building was inaugurated on April 5, 1888. Layton provided a $100,000 endowment to the new gallery for the acquisition of artworks, while part of his own collection was put on display. Wisconsin painters Edwin C. Eldridge and George Raab served as the gallery&#x27;s first and second curators, respectively.

In parallel, the Milwaukee Art Association (later Milwaukee Art Society), created by a group of German panorama artists and local businessmen, disputed the claim to be the city&#x27;s first art gallery, having also been established in 1888. In 1911, it relocated to a new building adjacent to the Layton Art Gallery and eventually took on the name of Milwaukee Art Institute five years later. The institute&#x27;s collection consisted mostly of gifts and purchases from Wisconsin artists, as well as gifts from the personal collection of its first director, Samuel O. Buckner.

Following Frederick Layton&#x27;s death, George Raab was replaced by educator Charlotte Partridge as curator and director of the Layton Art Gallery in 1922. Partridge had founded the Layton School of Art two years prior, and would continue to lead it along with her lifelong partner, art instructor Miriam Frink. During her tenure, she focused on contemporary art exhibitions and acquisitions, and additionally served as director of the Federal Art Project for Wisconsin from 1935 to 1939, as part of the Works Progress Administration, a New Deal agency. Meanwhile, the Milwaukee Art Institute came under the direction of German-born painter Alfred Pelikan in 1926, a position he occupied until 1942.
In 1954, Partridge retired from the Layton Art Gallery, while Frink retired from the directorship of the Layton School of Art, where she was replaced by artist Edmund Lewandowski. A year later, the Milwaukee Art Institute and Layton Art Gallery formed the Milwaukee Art Center, under the direction of art historian and museum curator Edward H. Dwight. The institution moved into the newly-built Eero Saarinen-designed Milwaukee County War Memorial and formally opened in 1957.

===Kahler Building and growth of collections===

In 1975, Margaret (Peg) Bradley, the widow of industrialist Harry Lynde Bradley, donated an ensemble of more than 600 European and American Modern artworks to the museum. Highlights of the gift include Fauvist paintings, German Expressionist works by Wassily Kandinsky and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, as well as a group of works by Georgia O’Keeffe. The brutalist Kahler Building (1975) was designed by architect David Kahler in response to the donation to house the museum&#x27;s new Bradley Wing, as well as other suites of galleries for the collection. Peg Bradley herself contributed $1 million to the construction of the addition. In the wake of the Kahler expansion, the name of Milwaukee Art Museum was officially adopted by the institution in 1980.

In 1999, the Milwaukee-based Chipstone Foundation established a partnership with the museum to display part of their collections of American decorative arts and furniture in dedicated galleries on a rotating basis.

===Quadracci Pavilion and further expansions (since 2001)===
The Quadracci Pavilion, a multi-purpose 13,197-square-meter (142,050-square-foot) building including a reception hall, auditorium, exhibition space, and store, was designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava and completed in 2001. The construction method of concrete slabs into timber frames was revolutionary in architecture, with Windover Hall, a -tall grand reception area topped with a glass roof, standing at the center of the structure. The style and symbolism of the building were based on Gothic architecture and designed to represent the shape of a ship looking over Lake Michigan. As Calatrava stated, “the building’s form is at once formal (completing the composition), functional (controlling the level of light), symbolic (opening to welcome visitors), and iconic (creating a memorable image for the Museum and the city).” The Quadracci Pavilion contains a movable &quot;brise soleil&quot; that opens up for a wingspan of during the day, folding at night or during inclement weather. Sensors on the wings monitor wind speeds, so if winds reach over for at least three seconds, the wings close. The pavilion received the 2004 Outstanding Structure Award from the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering. The addition brought the total size of the museum to 341,000 square feet. 

The Cudahy Gardens were designed in conjunction with the Quadracci Pavilion by landscape architect Dan Kiley. This garden measures 600 feet by 100 feet, a rectangular shape that is divided into five lawns by a series of ten-foot-tall hedge lines. In this garden there is a center fountain that creates a 4-foot-tall water curtain. There are linden trees and crabapple trees scattered throughout this garden as well. The gardens were named after philanthropist Michael Cudahy, whose donations greatly contributed to their construction.

The year 2001 saw the opening of the Herzfeld Photography, Print, and Drawing Study Center on the lower level of the Kahler Building, following a gift from the Milwaukee-based Richard and Ethel Herzfeld Foundation. In 2004, the museum acquired close to 300 American and European works through the gift of the collection of Maurice and Esther Leah Ritz. This was followed in 2010 and 2012 by the acquisition of close to 500 folk and self-taught American artworks from the collections of businessman Anthony Petullo and playwright Lanford Wilson, including paintings and sculpture by African American artists Bill Traylor, Clementine Hunter, William L. Hawkins, Joseph Yoakum, Minnie Evans, and Bessie Harvey.
In November 2015, the museum opened a $34 million expansion funded jointly by a museum capital campaign and by Milwaukee County. The expansion was designed by Milwaukee architect James Shields and the HGA firm to provide additional gallery space, including a section devoted to light-based media, photography, and video installations. The two-story building&#x27;s total size is 120,000 sq. ft., including a new atrium and lakefront-facing entry point for visitors. The design emerged after a lengthy process that included the main architect&#x27;s temporary departure because of design disputes in 2014.
In 2017, the museum grouped its George Peckham Miller Art Research Library (established in 1916), its archives, and its manuscripts under a unique Milwaukee Art Museum Research Center, before relocating part of these collections to the historic Judge Jason Downer Mansion, in the neighborhood of Yankee Hill. The house was built in the High Victorian Gothic style for lawyer and former Wisconsin Supreme Court justice Jason Downer in 1874. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989, along with several properties, as part of the First Ward Triangle Historic District. Among archival collections preserved by the museum are the papers and drawings of industrial designer Brooks Stevens and interior designer George Mann Niedecken.

In December 2017, the museum announced its purchase of nearby O&#x27;Donnell Park from Milwaukee County. The institution had already commissioned the installation of &quot;The Calling&quot;, a public sculpture by American artist Mark di Suvero, on the site in 1982. In 2023, the park was officially renamed Museum Center Park.

== Collection ==
The museum houses over 34,000 works of art, a selection of which is presented on four floors, with works from antiquity to the present. Included in the collection are 15th- to 20th-century European and 17th- to 20th-century American paintings, sculpture, prints, drawings, decorative arts, photographs, and folk and self-taught art. Some artists represented include Gustave Caillebotte, Francisco de Zurbarán, Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Auguste Rodin, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Gabriele Münter, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Frank Lloyd Wright, Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, Wassily Kandinsky, Mark Rothko, Robert Gober, and Andy Warhol.

It also has paintings by European painters Francesco Botticini, Jan Swart van Groningen, Jan van Goyen, Franz von Lenbach, Ferdinand Waldmüller, Carl Spitzweg, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Jean-Léon Gérôme, Gustave Caillebotte, Camille Pissarro, Jules Bastien-Lepage, and Max Pechstein.

=== Funding ===
As of 2015, the museum’s endowment is around $65 million. Endowment proceeds cover a fraction of the museum&#x27;s expenses, leaving it overly dependent on funds from day-to-day operations such as ticket sales. Daniel Keegan, who has served as the museum&#x27;s director since 2008, negotiated an agreement with Milwaukee County and the Milwaukee County War Memorial for the long-term management and funding of the facilities in 2013. In 2024, a $3.54 million gift helped establish an endowment to make admission to the museum free for children aged 12 and under.

==Controversy==
In June 2015 the museum&#x27;s display of a work depicting Benedict XVI, composed of 17,000 latex condoms, created outrage among Catholics and others.

== In popular culture ==
The Quadracci Pavilion makes an appearance in the 2008 EA racing video game &quot;Need for Speed: Undercover,&quot; as well as the film &quot;&quot;, where it stands for the headquarters of car collector Dylan Gould (played by actor Patrick Dempsey).

The 2011 comedy film &quot;Bridesmaids&quot;, set in Milwaukee, features opening aerial shots of the museum.

In 2020, the Quadracci Pavilion also featured in season 2, episode 11 of the comedy television series &quot;Joe Pera Talks with You&quot;, titled “Joe Pera Shows You How to Do Good Fashion”.

<doc id="526827" wikidata="Q312063" url="?curid=526827" title="Kalanchoe">
<text>Kalanchoe ( ), (also called &quot;kalanchöe&quot; or &quot;kalanchoë&quot;), is a genus of about 125 species of tropical, succulent plants in the stonecrop family Crassulaceae, mainly native to Madagascar and tropical Africa. A &quot;Kalanchoe&quot; species was one of the first plants to be sent into space, sent on a resupply to the Soviet Salyut 1 space station in 1979. The majority of kalanchoes require around 6–8 hours of sunlight a day; a few cannot tolerate this, and survive with bright, indirect sunlight to bright shade.

==Description==
Most are shrubs or perennial herbaceous plants, but a few are annual or biennial. The largest, &quot;Kalanchoe beharensis&quot; from Madagascar, can reach tall, but most species are less than tall.

Kalanchoes open their flowers by growing new cells on the inner surface of the petals to force them outwards, and on the outside of the petals to close them. Kalanchoe flowers are divided into 4 sections with 8 stamens. The petals are fused into a tube, in a similar way to some related genera such as &quot;Cotyledon&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Kalanchoe&quot; was first described by the French botanist Michel Adanson in 1763.

The genus Bryophyllum was described by Salisbury in 1806 and the genus Kitchingia was created by Baker in 1881. &quot;Kitchingia&quot; is now regarded as a synonym for &quot;Kalanchoe&quot;, while &quot;Bryophyllum&quot; has also been treated as a separate genus, since species of &quot;Bryophyllum&quot; appear to be nested within Kalanchoe on molecular phylogenetic analysis, &quot;Bryophyllum&quot; is considered as a section of the former, dividing the genus into three sections, &quot;Kitchingia&quot;, &quot;Bryophyllum&quot;, and &quot;Eukalanchoe&quot;. these were formalised as subgenera by Smith and Figueiredo (2018).

===Etymology===
Adanson cited Georg Joseph Kamel (Camellus) as his source for the name. The name came from the Cantonese name 伽藍菜 (Jyutping: gaa1 laam4 coi3).

&quot;Kalanchoe ceratophylla&quot; and &quot;Kalanchoe laciniata&quot; are both called (apparently &quot;Buddhist monastery &quot;[samghārāma]&quot; herb&quot;) in China. In Mandarin Chinese, it does not seem very close in pronunciation (&quot;qiélán cài&quot;, but possibly &quot;jiālán cài&quot; or &quot;gālán cài&quot; as the character has multiple pronunciations), but the Cantonese &quot;gālàahm choi&quot; is closer.

===List of hybrids===
Several hybrids within &quot;Kalanchoe&quot; are known:
* &quot;K. houghtonii&quot; = &quot;K. daigremontiana&quot; × &quot;K. delagoensis&quot;
* &quot;K. lokarana&quot;
* &quot;K. poincarei&quot;
* &quot;K. rechingeri&quot;
* &quot;K. richaudii&quot; = &quot;K. delagoensis&quot; × &quot;K. rosei&quot;

==Distribution and ecology== 
The genus is predominantly native to the Old World. Only one species originates from the Americas. 56 are from southern and eastern Africa and 60 species on the island of Madagascar. It is also found in south-eastern Asia and China.

These plants are food plants for caterpillars of the Red Pierrot butterfly. The butterfly lays its eggs on leaves, and after hatching, caterpillars burrow into the leaves and eat their inside cells.

==Cultivation and uses==

These plants are cultivated as ornamental houseplants and rock or succulent garden plants. They are popular because of their ease of propagation, low water requirements, and wide variety of flower colors typically borne in clusters well above the leaves. The section &quot;Bryophyllum&quot;—formerly an independent genus—contains species such as the &quot;air-plant&quot; &quot;Kalanchoe pinnata&quot;. In these plants, new individuals develop vegetatively as plantlets, also known as bulbils or gemmae, at indentations in leaf margins. These young plants eventually drop off and take root. No males have been found of one species of this genus which does flower and produce seeds, and it is commonly called the mother of thousands: &quot;Kalanchoe daigremontiana&quot; is thus an example of asexual reproduction.

The cultivars &#x27;Tessa&#x27; and &#x27;Wendy&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Diseases==
==Traditional medicine ==
In traditional medicine, &quot;Kalanchoe&quot; species have been used to treat ailments such as infections, rheumatism and inflammation. &quot;Kalanchoe&quot; extracts also have immunosuppressive effects. &quot;Kalanchoe pinnata&quot; has been recorded in Trinidad and Tobago as being used as a traditional treatment for hypertension.

A variety of bufadienolide compounds have been isolated from various &quot;Kalanchoe&quot; species. Five different bufadienolides have been isolated from &quot;Kalanchoe daigremontiana&quot;. Two of these, daigremontianin and bersaldegenin 1,3,5-orthoacetate, have been shown to have a pronounced sedative effect. They also have the strong positive inotropic effect associated with cardiac glycosides, and with greater doses an increasing effect on the central nervous system.

Bufadienolide compounds isolated from &quot;Kalanchoe pinnata&quot; include bryophillin A which showed strong anti-tumor promoting activity, and bersaldegenin-3-acetate and bryophillin C which were less active. Bryophillin C also showed insecticidal properties.

<text>This is a list of [[cruiser]]s of the [[Royal Navy]] of the United Kingdom from 1877 (when the category was created by amalgamating the two previous categories of frigate and corvette) until the last cruiser was decommissioned more than a century later. There are no longer any cruisers in the Royal Navy. 

== First class cruisers ==
Armoured cruisers were protected by a belt of side armour and an armoured deck. In the Royal Navy this classification was not actually used, the term first class cruiser being used instead for both armoured cruisers and large protected cruisers. Thus, the first class cruisers built between the &quot;Orlando&quot; class (1886) and the &quot;Cressy&quot; class (1897) were, strictly speaking, protected cruisers as they lacked an armoured belt. The first class cruiser was succeeded by the battlecruiser in the Royal Navy.

==Protected cruisers==
Protected cruisers were so-called because their vital machinery spaces were protected by an armoured deck and the arrangement of coal bunkers. The ships below are all protected cruisers, but were rated as second and third class cruisers by the Royal Navy. The third class cruiser was not expected to operate with the fleet, was substantially smaller than the second class and lacked the watertight double-bottom of the latter. With the advent of turbine machinery, oil firing and better armour plate the protected cruiser became obsolete and was succeeded by the light cruiser.

==Scout cruisers==
The scout cruiser was a smaller, faster, more lightly armed and armoured cruiser than the protected cruiser, intended for fleet scouting duties and acting as a flotilla leader. Essentially there were two distinct groups – the eight vessels all ordered under the 1903 Programme, and the seven later vessels ordered under the 1907-1910 Programmes. The advent of better machinery and larger, faster destroyers and light cruisers effectively made them obsolete.

==Light cruisers==
The light armoured cruiser – light cruiser – succeeded the protected cruiser; improvements in machinery and armour rendering the latter obsolete. The of 1910 were rated as second-class protected cruisers, but were effectively light armoured cruisers with mixed coal and oil firing. The of 1913 were the first oil-only fired class. This meant that the arrangement of coal bunkers in the hull could no longer be relied upon as protection and the adoption of destroyer-type machinery resulted in a higher speed. This makes the &quot;Arethusa&quot;s the first &quot;true example&quot; of the warship that came to be recognised as the light cruiser. In the London Naval Treaty of 1930, light cruisers were officially defined as cruisers having guns of 6.1 inches (155 mm) calibre or less, with a displacement not exceeding 10,000 tons.

==Heavy cruisers==
The heavy cruiser was defined in the London Naval Treaty of 1930 as a cruiser with a main gun calibre more than 6 inches but not exceeding 8 inches. The earlier &quot;Hawkins&quot; class were therefore retrospectively classified as such, although they had been initially built as &quot;improved light cruisers&quot;. The County were built as light cruisers with most of them in service at the time of the Treaty of London, after which they were also redesignated as heavy cruisers. A further three Countys were cancelled. The &quot;York&quot; class was a reduced version of the County to build more ships within tonnage limits.

==Through-deck cruisers==
Although at times called &quot;through-deck cruisers&quot;, the &quot;Invincible&quot; class of the 1980s were small aircraft carriers.

<text>Kurt Browning (born June 18, 1966) is a Canadian figure skater, choreographer and commentator. He is the first skater to land a ratified quadruple jump in competition. He is a four-time World Champion and Canadian national champion. He competed at three different Olympic Games.

== Career ==
Kurt Browning represented Canada in three Winter Olympics, 1988 (finishing 8th overall), 1992 (6th) and 1994 (5th). Browning won the Canadian novice championships in 1983 and was the Canadian junior champion in 1985. He was the senior champion of Canada four times and came in second place three times. He won the World Championships four times, in 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1993. He came in second place at Worlds in 1992 due to a severe back injury that &quot;had a particularly negative effect on his Olympic bid&quot;. He came in fifth place at the 1994 Winter Olympics. He earned the privilege of carrying the Canadian flag during the opening ceremonies of the 1994 games in Lillehammer, Norway. Browning&#x27;s other achievements include three Canadian Professional Championships and three World Professional Championships.

On March 25, 1988, at the 1988 World Championships in Budapest, Hungary, Browning landed the first ratified quadruple jump, a toe loop in the competition. This accomplishment is listed in the Guinness Book of Records. Jozef Sabovčík had previously landed a quad toe loop at the 1986 European Championships which was recognized at the event but then ruled invalid three weeks later. Browning later said, &quot;I remember that there were a few people landing the jump (in practice) long before I did, and by watching them I was inspired to try it myself. After landing it, I certainly expected more skaters to start doing it in competition. I was surprised in the next few years when that really did not happen.&quot; Browning is also known for his intricate, fast, often lighthearted footwork. Browning has used percussive pop instrumentals in his programs; for example, he used &quot;Bonzo&#x27;s Montreux&quot; by Led Zeppelin in 1993. He interpreted the music by punching his fists and frequently running across the ice. The following season he used &quot;St. Louis Blues,&quot; wearing a tight black t-shirt, stretch pants, and belt. He also raised his fists &quot;in a biceps-flexing muscle pose&quot; and included humor by emulating laughter with upper body movements, skated in time to descending saxophone notes and by pointing to the audience during his footwork sequence.

As figure skating historian James R. Hines has stated, &quot;Browning is remembered for outstanding interpretative programs&quot;. For example, Hines calls Browning&#x27;s free skating program in 1993, set to music from the film &quot;Casablanca&quot; and choreographed by Sandra Bezic, &quot;is most memorable&quot;. He portrayed Rick, Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s character, and like Bogart, wore a white dinner jacket. One of Browning&#x27;s iconic programs is &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, where he emulates Gene Kelly&#x27;s dancing in the film. Choreographed by Bezic and debuted in a CBC-TV special in 1994, this program is still asked to be performed at ice shows after 20 years. He has also appeared in made-for-television films and toured with Stars on Ice.

As a commentator, Browning has made frequent appearances since turning professional in 1994. He has been a regular colour commentator for the CBC at major skating events since 2006.

Browning appeared in the 2006 Fox television program &quot;Skating with Celebrities&quot;. Starting in 2009, he was the co-host of Battle of the Blades.

As a choreographer, he has choreographed programs for many figure skaters including:

* Jeremy Abbott
* Kevin Alves
* Patrick Chan
* Vaughn Chipeur
* Marc-André Craig
* Alissa Czisny
* Javier Fernández 
* Yuzuru Hanyu
* Takeshi Honda
* Brian Joubert
* Tuğba Karademir
* Carolina Kostner
* Takahiko Kozuka
* Tara Lipinski
* Evan Lysacek
* Brandon Mroz
* Lucinda Ruh
* Jamie Salé / David Pelletier
* Yuka Sato
* Tomáš Verner
* Yan Han
He also co-directed and choreographed the 2011–12 Stars on Ice tour.

== Awards and honors ==
Browning was awarded with a Lou Marsh Trophy for top Canadian Athlete (in 1990), Lionel Conacher Awards (1990 and 1991), an American Skating World Professional Skater of the Year Award (in 1998), and a Gustav Lussi Award from the Professional Skaters&#x27; Association (in 2001).

He was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada (CM) in 1989.

Browning was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1994 and Skate Canada Hall of Fame in 2000. He was honored with a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in 2001. He was inducted into World Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2006. He received the inaugural ISU Skating Lifetime Achievement Award in 2020.

== Personal life ==
Browning was born on June 18, 1966, in Rocky Mountain House, Alberta. He was raised in Caroline, Alberta.

He married Sonia Rodriguez, a principal dancer with the National Ballet of Canada, on June 30, 1996. Their first son, Gabriel, was born on July 12, 2003, and their second son, Dillon, was born on August 14, 2007. They are now divorced.
Browning&#x27;s home in the Forest Hill area of Toronto suffered a fire on August 18, 2010.

He married Alissa Czisny on August 11, 2022.

<doc id="526841" wikidata="Q282554" url="?curid=526841" title="Siena Cathedral">
<text>Siena Cathedral () is a medieval church in Siena, Italy, dedicated from its earliest days as a Roman Catholic Marian church, and now dedicated to the Assumption of Mary.

Since the early 13th-century the Siena Cathedral has been an important part of the Sienese identity. One way to see this is the continuous building projects constantly surrounding the cathedral from its earliest days, aiming at reinforcing and expanding this impressive site. Indeed, it was the community of citizens that continually advocated for the cathedral to become one of the largest churches in Europe. For centuries the Cathedral acted as more than just a place of worship - it was the center of the city and a place to express civic pride. 

The cathedral was designed and completed between 1215 and 1263 on the site of an earlier structure. It has the form of a Latin cross with a slightly projecting transept, a dome and a bell tower. The dome rises from a hexagonal base with supporting columns. The dome was completed in 1264. The lantern atop the dome was added by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The bell tower has six bells, where the oldest one was cast in 1149. The nave is separated from the two aisles by semicircular arches. The exterior and interior are constructed of white and greenish-black marble in alternating stripes, with the addition of red marble on the façade. Black and white are the symbolic colors of Siena, etiologically linked to black and white horses of the legendary city&#x27;s founders, Senius and Aschius. The finest Italian artists of that era completed works in the cathedral. These artists were Nicola and Giovanni Pisano, Donatello, Pinturicchio, Lorenzo Ghiberti, and Bernini.

It was the episcopal seat of the Diocese of Siena, and from the 15th century that of the Archdiocese of Siena. It is now the seat of the Archdiocese of Siena-Colle di Val d&#x27;Elsa-Montalcino.

== Early history ==
The origins of the first structure are shrouded in legend. There was a 9th-century church with the bishop&#x27;s palace at the present location. In December 1058 a synod was held in this church resulting in the election of pope Nicholas II and the deposition of the antipope Benedict X. There is a common myth that the cathedral was consecrated on November 18, 1179, but there is little evidence to support this idea. There is evidence that the concentration ceremony occurred on November 18, according to the &quot;Ordo Officiorum Ecclesiae senensis&quot;, but without reference to a specific year.

In 1196, the cathedral masons’ guild, the &quot;Opera di Santa Maria&quot;, was put in charge of the construction of a new cathedral. Works were started with the north–south transept and it was planned to add the main, larger body of the cathedral later, but this enlargement was never accomplished.

By 1215 there were already daily masses said in the new church. Beginning in 1226, city records show that black and white marble blocks were being transported to the cathedral, presumably to be used for the facade and bell tower. These records also note the payment of stone masons to work with the marble blocks. The vaults and the transept were constructed in 1259–1260 at the order of the committee composed of city citizens. In 1259 Manuello di Ranieri and his son Parri carved the wooden choir stalls, which were replaced about 100 years later and have now disappeared. In 1264, Rosso Padellaio helped create the copper sphere on top of the dome. The pulpit, one of the few original works to survive today, was made between 1265-1268 by Nicola Pisano and his followers. This group was most likely also responsible for carving the main altar. The &quot;Opera di Santa Maria&quot; ordered stained glass for a large, round window in 1287. 
A second massive addition of the main body of the cathedral was planned in 1339. It would have more than doubled the size of the structure by means of an entirely new nave and two aisles ranged perpendicular to the existing nave and centered on the high altar. The majority of construction was under the direction of Giovanni di Agostino, a well-known sculptor of the time. Construction was halted by the Black Death in 1348. Unfortunately, the halt in construction revealed the failures already present in the new structure, such as a shallow foundation and weak building materials. The project was abandoned officially in 1355, and the work never resumed. The outer walls, remains of this extension, can now be seen to the south of the Duomo, while the floors of the uncompleted nave now serve as a parking lot and museum. Though unfinished, the remains are a testament to Sienese power, ambition, and artistic achievement. One of the walls can be climbed by narrow stairs for a high view of the city. The bell tower is one of the only modern aspects dated before 1215, built between the nave and south transept.

== Façade ==

The façade of Siena Cathedral is one of the most fascinating in all of Italy and certainly one of the most impressive features in Siena. Each of the cardinal points (west, east, north, and south) has its own distinct work; by far the most impressive of these is the west façade. Acting as the main entryway to the Duomo proper, it boasts three portals (see Portal (architecture)); the central one is capped by a bronze-work sun.

Built in two stages and combining elements of French Gothic, Tuscan Romanesque architecture, and Classical architecture, the west façade is a beautiful example of Sienese workmanship. 

Work began on the lower part around 1284. Built using polychrome marble, the work was overseen by Giovanni Pisano whose work on the Duomo&#x27;s façade and the pulpit was influenced by his father Nicola Pisano. Built in Tuscan Romanesque style it emphasizes a horizontal unity of the area around the portals at the expense of the vertical bay divisions. The three portals, surmounted by lunettes, are based on Giovanni Pisano&#x27;s original designs, as are much of the sculpture and orientation surrounding the entrances. The areas around and above the doors, as well as the columns between the portals, are richly decorated with acanthus scrolls, allegorical figures and biblical scenes. The figures above the portals, many of whom were Old Testament prophets, were carved exaggerated poses and features, to enable them to be seen from far away. 

Giovanni Pisano was able to oversee his work until about 1296 when he abruptly left Siena, reportedly over creative differences with the Opera del Duomo, the group that oversaw the construction and maintenance of the Siena cathedrals. Pisano&#x27;s work on the lower façade was continued under the direction of Camaino di Crescentino, but a number of changes were made to the original plan. These included raising the façade due to the raising of the nave of the church and the installation of a larger rose window based on designs by Duccio di Buoninsegna and commissioned by the city of Siena. Work on the west façade came to an abrupt end in 1317 when the Opera del Duomo redirected all efforts to the east façade.
There is debate as to when work on the upper façade was completed. Most scholars agree that it was finished sometime between 1360 and 1370, though when it began again is not known. The work continued to use Pisano&#x27;s plans for the façade with some adaptations under the direction of Giovanni di Cecco. Di Cecco preferred more elaborate designs, most likely inspired by the Orvieto Cathedral. The façade needed to be much higher than foreseen as the nave had, once again, been raised.

The changes were probably needed to accommodate the raised nave and di Cecco&#x27;s more elaborate design scheme, heavily influenced by French Gothic architecture, which caused the apparent division of the upper portion of the cathedral. Most noticeably the pinnacles of the upper portion do not continue from the columns flanking the central portal as they normally would in such cathedrals. Instead, they are substantially offset, resulting in a vertical discontinuity which is uncommon in cathedrals of the time as it can lead to structural weakness. To adjust for this imbalance, the towers on each side of the cathedral were opened by adding windows, reducing the weight they needed to support. The upper portion also features heavy Gothic decoration, a marked contrast to the simple geometric designed common to Tuscan Romanesque architecture.
While most of the sculpture decorating the lower level of the lavish façade was sculpted by Giovanni Pisano and assistant depicting prophets, philosophers and apostles, the more Gothic statuary adorning the upper portion—including the half-length statues of the patriarchs in the niches around the rose window—are works of later, unattributed, sculptors. Almost all the statuary adorning the cathedral today are copies. The originals are kept in the Crypt of the Statues in the Museo dell&#x27;Opera del Duomo.

Three large mosaics on the gables of the façade were made in Venice in 1878. The large central mosaic, the Coronation of the Virgin, is the work of Luigi Mussini. The smaller mosaics on each side, Nativity of Jesus and Presentation of Mary in the Temple, were made by Alessandro Franchi.

The bronze central door is a recent addition to the cathedral, replacing the original wooden one. The large door, known as the Porta della Riconoscenza, was commissioned in 1946 near the end of the German occupation of Siena. Sculpted by Vico Consorti and cast by Enrico Manfrini, the scenes on the door represent the Glorification of the Virgin, Siena&#x27;s patron saint.

On the left corner pier of the façade is a 14th-century inscription marking the grave of Giovanni Pisano. Next to the façade stands a column with a statue of the Contrade Lupa, a wolf breast-feeding Romulus and Remus. According to local legend Senius and Aschius, sons of Remus and founders of Siena, left Rome with the statue, stolen from the Temple of Apollo in Rome.

== Interior ==

In the interior the pictorial effect of the black and white marble stripes on the walls and columns strikes the eye. Black and white are the colours of the civic coat of arms of Siena. The capitals of the columns in the west bays of the nave are sculpted with allegorical busts and animals. The horizontal molding around the nave and the presbytery contains 172 plaster busts of popes dating from the 15th and 16th centuries starting with St. Peter and ending with Lucius III. The spandrels of the round arches below this cornice exhibit the busts of 36 emperors. The vaulted roof is decorated in blue with golden stars, replacing frescoes on the ceiling, while the formerets (half ribs) and the tiercerons (secondary ribs) are adorned with richly elaborated motifs.

The stained-glass round window in the choir was made in 1288 to the designs of Duccio. Divided into registers, the window depicts the &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot;. It is one of the earliest remaining examples of Italian stained glass. in 1308-1311 Duccio created a magnificent double sided altarpiece, the &quot;Maestá&quot;, which illustrated the Madonna Enthroned. Situated directly beneath the &quot;Assumption of Mary&quot; stained glass, these two works presented a unified visual theme that emphasized the Virgin Mary, to whom the Cathedral is dedicated.


The hexagonal dome is topped with Bernini&#x27;s gilded lantern, like a golden sun. The &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; coffers were painted in blue with golden stars in the late 15th century. The colonnade in the drum is adorned with images and statues of 42 patriarchs and prophets, painted in 1481 by Guidoccio Cozzarelli and Benvenuto di Giovanni. The eight stucco statues in the spandrels beneath the dome were sculpted in 1490 by Ventura di Giuliano and Bastiano di Francesco. Originally they were polychromed, but later, in 1704, gilded.

Next to the first two pillars, there are two fonts, carved by Antonio Federighi in 1462–1463. His basin for the Blessing of Holy Water was later transferred to the chapel of San Giovanni.

The marble high altar of the presbytery was built in 1532 by Baldassarre Peruzzi. The enormous bronze ciborium is the work of Vecchietta (1467–1472, originally commissioned for the church of the Hospital of Santa Maria della Scala, across the square, and brought to the cathedral in 1506). At the sides of the high altar, the uppermost angels are masterpieces by Francesco di Giorgio Martini (1439–1502).

Against the pillars of the presbytery, there are eight candelabras in the form of angels by Domenico Beccafumi (1548–1550), He also painted the frescoes, representing &quot;Saints&quot; and &quot;Paradise&quot;, on the walls in the apse. These were partially repainted in 1912. Behind the main altar is a very large painting &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot; by Bartolomeo Cesi in 1594.
The presbytery keeps also the beautiful wooden choir stalls, made between 1363–1397 and extended in the 16th century. Originally there were more than ninety choir stalls, arranged in double rows. The remaining 36 stalls are each crowned by the bust of a saint in a pointed niche. Their backs are decorated with carved panels, the work of Fra’ Giovanni da Verona in 1503.

== Pulpit ==
The pulpit is made of Carrara marble and was sculpted between the end of 1265 and November 1268 by Nicola Pisano and several other artists. This pulpit expresses the northern Gothic style adopted by Pisano, while still showing his classical influences. The whole message of the pulpit is concerned with the doctrine of Salvation and the Last Judgment. In the top level, seven scenes narrate the Life of Christ. The many figures in each scene with their chiaroscuro effect, show a richness of surface, motion, and narrative. On the middle-level statuettes of the Evangelists and Prophets announce the salvation of mankind. The pulpit itself is the earliest remaining work in the cathedral. The staircase dates from 1543 and was built by Bartolomeo Neroni. At the same time, the pulpit was moved from the choir to its present location.

== The Marble Floor ==

The inlaid marble mosaic floor is one of the most ornate of its kind in Italy, covering the whole floor of the cathedral. Visitors have been amazed by the stunning effect of these floors for centuries. Indeed, Giorgio Vasari, an Italian Renaissance painter and architect, claimed the floor was “&quot;the most beautiful … great and magnificent pavement ever made.&quot;” This undertaking went on from the 14th to the 16th centuries, and about forty artists made their contribution, the majority of whom were Sienese. The floor consists of 56 panels in different sizes. Most have a rectangular shape, but the later ones in the transept are hexagons or rhombuses. They represent the sibyls, scenes from the Old Testament, allegories, virtues, and figures from the ancient world. Most are still in their original state. The earliest scenes were made by a graffito technique: drilling tiny holes and scratching lines in the marble and filling these with bitumen or mineral pitch. In a later stage black, white, green, red, and blue marble intarsia were used. This technique of marble inlay also evolved during the years, finally resulting in a vigorous contrast of light and dark, giving it an almost modern, impressionistic composition.

The uncovered floor can only be seen for a period of six to ten weeks each year, generally including the month of September. The rest of the year, the pavements near the altar are covered, and only some near the entrance may be viewed.

=== Nave and Aisles ===

==== Nave ====

The nave, or central part of the church, contains scenes from classical antiquity. It is unusual to see figures from pagan and classical antiquity in a church from this time period. These additions were primarily included from the influence of two Sienese popes, Enea Silvio Piccolomini and Francesco Tedeschini Piccolomini, who believed that classical authors and figures held knowledge that is applicable across faith traditions.

At the entrance of the nave is a scene containing &quot;Hermes Trismegistus&quot;, a popular figure of the fifteenth century who was seen as the ‘founder of human wisdom.’ Designed by Giovanni di Stefano in 1488, this panel welcomes visitors into the church and introduces the theme of knowledge that develops throughout the nave and side aisles.

&quot;The She-Wolf Suckling Romulus and Remus&quot;, or &quot;The She Wolf of Siena&quot; was originally created in the 1360’s but heavily restored by Leopoldo Maccari in 1865. It portrays a wolf in the center surrounded by eight smaller circles, each depicting the emblem of major Italian cities.

&quot;Allegory of the Mount of Wisdom&quot; was designed by Pinturicchio in 1505 and completed in 1506 by Paolo Mannuci. This complicated scene includes a feminine personification of Fortune who is leading a group of wise men up a rocky, dangerous path to great the female personification of Wisdom.

The final panel in the nave is &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; (completed in 1372 and restored in 1864 by Leopoldo Maccari). The central image is of a wheel, where a king sits at the top and three male figures cling to the wheel. Surrounding the wheel are four figures depicting philosophers from the ancient world.
==== Side Aisles ====
The side aisles along the nave are decorated with ten panels (five in each aisle) of the &quot;Sibyls&quot;. Each panel contains a Sibyl that is an allegorical representation of the known world of the time, as identified by an accompanying inscription: &quot;Persian Sibyl&quot;, &quot;Hellespontine Sibyl&quot;, &quot;Eritrean Sibyl&quot;, &quot;Phrygian Sibyl&quot;, &quot;Samian Sibyl&quot;, &quot;Delphic Sibyl&quot;, &quot;Libyan Sibyl&quot;, &quot;Cimmerian Sibyl&quot;, &quot;Cumaen Sibyl&quot;, and &quot;Tiburtine Sibyl&quot;. The effect of these allegorical figures represent the universality of the Christian message. Each full-length Sibyl is contrasted against a black and red background, and illustrated in a variety of poses with flowing robes. 

=== Transepts and Chancel ===
The scenes in the transepts and chancel represent biblical stories and mark the thematic transition from the scenes in the naves and aisles, which depicted figures from classical antiquity. The biblical scenes all focus on the theme of humanity’s salvation. 

(In a church shaped like a cross, transepts are ‘arm’ shapes of the cross, and the chancel is the center of the church, where the transepts and nave meet. In the Siena Cathedral, the chancel encompasses the area below the dome and in front of the altar.)

==== Left Transept ====
The left transept contains three large panels: &quot;The Expulsion of Herod&quot;, &quot;The Slaughter of the Innocents&quot;, and &quot;The Story of Judith&quot;. 

&quot;The&quot; &quot;Expulsion of Herod&quot; by Benvenuto di Giovanni (1484-1485) in an incredibly intricate scene representing God’s revenge against Herod, the persecutor of John the Baptist. 

&quot;The Slaughter of the Innocents&quot; by Matteo di Giovanni is one of the most awe-inspiring panels of the cathedral, and has evoked emotional responses from visitors since its creation in 1481. The panel articulates the desperation of the mothers who are trying to save their babies from the slaughter of malicious guards. This is the only scene from the New Testament. 

&quot;The Story of Judith&quot; by Francesco di Giorgio Martini (1473), located near the pulpit, depicts the Old Testament narrative of Judith beheading Holofernes, an enemy general. 

==== Chancel ====

The majority of the panels in the chancel are grouped together in a large hexagonal portion of the pavement and depict &quot;Scenes from the Lives of Elijah and Ahab&quot;. Each of these scenes are either designed within a hexagonal panel or smaller rhombus-shaped panel. The upper half of these scenes (four of the seven hexagons and two of the six rhombuses) were completed from 1519-1524 by Domenico Beccafumi, who was the most renowned Sienese artist of his time. He worked on cartoons for the floor for thirty years (1518–1547) and made vast contributions to the cathedral’s pavement. The lower portion wasn’t completed until 1878 by Alessandro Franchi.

Beccafumi’s eight-meter long frieze &quot;Moses Striking water from the Rock&quot; was completed in 1525. This panel marks a technical and stylistic shift from Beccafumi’s earlier work. Here, the artist used different tones within the same piece of marble to create figures heavily contrasted by light and shadow.

The subsequent section, also by Beccafumi, portrays &quot;Scenes from the Life of Moses on Mount Sinai&quot;. The large panel, completed from 1525-1529, is a continuation of the previous story and employs a similar technical and stylistic method. Rather than isolating each scene within a panel, the entire panel merges the scenes together in one combined section.

Next are five panels arranged horizontally: &quot;Joshua Defeats the Five Kings of the Amorites&quot;, &quot;David the Psalmist&quot; between &quot;David the Slingsman&quot; and &quot;Goliath Falling Backwards&quot;, and &quot;Samson Chastising the Philistines&quot;. The scenes portraying David are credited to Domenico di Niccolò dei Cori (1413-1423), the first known artist to work work on the panels. His successor, Paolo di Martino, completed &quot;Joshua Defeats the Five Kings of the Amorites&quot; and &quot;Samson Chastising the Philistines&quot; between 1424 and 1426 which contain more details than the previous panels. 

The final panel in the chancel, located directly in front of the altar, is &quot;Abraham’s Sacrifice,&quot; or &quot;Sacrifice of Isaac&quot;. Completed in 1547 by Beccafumi, the scene contains one large panel of Abraham&#x27;s sacrifice of Issac, surrounded by smaller rectangular panels of related scenes. 

Bordering the main altar is a geometric pattern containing five circular panels which depict &quot;Mercy&quot; and &quot;The Four Cardinal Virtues&quot; (Fortitude, Justice, Prudence, and Good Government)&quot;.&quot; The panels date from 1406, as established by a payment made to Marchese d&#x27;Adamo and his fellow workers who executed the cartoons of Sienese painters.

==== Right Transept ====

The right transept contains five sections of panels: &quot;The Seven Ages of Man&quot;, &quot;Religion and the Theological Virtues&quot;, &quot;The Story of Jephthah&quot;, &quot;The Death of Absalom&quot;, and &quot;Emperor Sigismund&quot;.

&quot;The Seven Ages of Man&quot; is a collection of six octagonal panels surrounding a central rectangular panel and woven together by a geometric rope-inspired pattern. They depict the stages of life a man goes through, from infancy to death. The majority of the original work by Antonio Federighi in 1457 was reconstructed in 1871.

&quot;Religion and the Theological Virtues&quot; is a set of panels, depicting an allegory of religion and three personifications of theological virtues (&quot;Hope&quot;, &quot;Faith&quot;, and &quot;Charity&quot;). The original works from 1780 were replaced a century later by designs by Alessandro Franchi. 

&quot;The Story of Jephthah&quot; is credited to Francesco di Giorgio Martini, and notably contains sixty characters throughout the panel. The finer details of the narrative have been lost over time.

&quot;The Death of Absalom&quot; by Pietro di Tommaso del Minella (1447) narrates a group of soldiers finding King David’s sin, Absalom, hanging dead from a tree. The figures are contrasted by a foreground of red marble, and a background of black marble.

In 1434 the renowned painter Domenico di Bartolo completed the panel &quot;Emperor Sigismund Enthroned&quot;. The Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund was popular in Siena, because he resided there for ten months on his way to Rome for his coronation. Today, the details are incredibly faded.

== Works of art ==

The cathedral&#x27;s valuable pieces of art including &quot;The Feast of Herod&quot; by Donatello, and works by Bernini and the young Michelangelo make it an extraordinary museum of Italian sculpture. The &quot;Annunciation between St. Ansanus and St. Margaret&quot;, a masterwork of Gothic painting by Simone Martini and Lippo Memmi, decorated a side altar of the church until 1799, when it was moved to the Uffizi of Florence.

The funeral monument for cardinal Riccardo Petroni (Siena 1250 - Genoa 1314, a jurisconsult of Pope Boniface VIII) was erected between 1317 and 1318 by the Sienese sculptor Tino di Camaino. He had succeeded his father as the master-builder of the Siena cathedral. The marble monument in the left transept is the earliest example of 14th-century funeral architecture. It is composed of a richly decorated sarcophagus, held aloft on the shoulders of four statues. Above the sarcophagus, two angels draw apart a curtain, revealing the cardinal lying on his deathbed, accompanied by two guardian angels. The monument is crowned by a spired tabernacle with statues of the Madonna and Child, Saint Peter and Saint Paul.

In the pavement, in front of this monument, lies the bronze tombstone of Bishop Giovanni di Bartolomeo Pecci, bishop of Grosseto, made by Donatello in 1427. It shows the dead prelate laid out in a concave bier in highly illusionistic low relief. Looking at it obliquely from the end of the tomb, gives the impression of a three-dimensionality. It was originally located in front of the high altar and moved to the present location in 1506.

The wall tomb of bishop Tommaso Piccolomini del Testa is set above the small door leading to the bell tower. It is the work of the Sienese painter and sculptor Neroccio di Bartolomeo de&#x27; Landi in 1483.

The Piccolomini Altarpiece, left of the entrance to the library, is the work of the Lombard sculptor Andrea Bregno in 1483. This altarpiece is remarkable because of the four sculptures in the lower niches, made by the young Michelangelo between 1501 and 1504: Saint Peter, Saint Paul, Saint Gregory (with the help of an assistant) and Saint Pius. On top of the altar is the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;, a sculpture (probably) by Jacopo della Quercia.

Many of the Duomo&#x27;s furnishings, reliquaries, and artwork, have been removed to the adjacent Museo dell&#x27;Opera del Duomo. This includes Duccio&#x27;s &quot;Maestà&quot; altarpiece, some panels of which are scattered around the world or lost. Duccio&#x27;s large stained glass window, original to the building, was removed out of precaution during WWII for fear of shattering from bombs or fire. A replica has been installed in the Duomo ever since. The glass depicts a typical Sienese religious subject- three panels of the death, Assumption, and Coronation of Mary, flanked by the city&#x27;s most important patron saints, Saint Ansanus; Saint Sabinus; Saint Crescentius; and Saint Victor, and in four corners are the Four Evangelists.

== Chapel of Saint John the Baptist ==

The Chapel of Saint John the Baptist is situated in the left transept. At the back of this chapel, amidst the rich renaissance decorations, is the bronze statue of St. John the Baptist by Donatello. In the middle of the chapel is a 15th-century a marnle font. But most impressive in this chapel are the eight frescoes by Pinturicchio, which were commissioned by Alberto Aringhieri and painted between 1504 and 1505. Two of the frescoes were repainted in the 17th century, while a third was completely replaced in 1868. The original paintings in the chapel are: &quot;Nativity of John the Baptist&quot;, &quot;John the Baptist in the desert&quot; and &quot;John the Baptist preaching&quot;. He also painted two portraits: &quot;Aringhieri with the cloak of the Order of the Knights of Malta&quot; and &quot;Kneeling Knight in Armour&quot;. These two portraits show us a very detailed background.

== The Chigi Chapel ==

The small Chigi Chapel (or Cappella della Madonna del Voto) is situated in the right transept. It is the last, most luxurious sculptural addition to the Duomo, and was commissioned in 1659 by the Sienese Chigi pope Alexander VII. This circular chapel with a gilded dome was built by the German architect Johann Paul Schor to the baroque designs of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, replacing a 15th-century chapel. At the back of the chapel is the &quot;Madonna del Voto&quot; (by a follower of Guido da Siena, 13th century), that even today is much venerated and receives each year the homages of the contrade. On the eve of the battle of Montaperti (4 September 1260) against Florence, the city of Siena had dedicated itself to the Madonna. The victory of the Sienese, against all odds, over the much more numerous Florentines was ascribed to her miraculous protection.

Two of the four marble sculptures in the niches, are by Bernini himself: &quot;Saint Jerome&quot; and &quot;Mary Magdalene&quot;. The other two are &quot;Saint Bernardine&quot; (Antonio Raggi) and &quot;Saint Catherine of Siena&quot; (Ercole Ferrata). The eight marble columns are originally from the Lateran Palace in Rome. The bronze gate at the entrance is by Giovanni Artusi.

== Piccolomini Library ==

The library was commissioned by cardinal Francesco Todeschini Piccolomini (then archbishop of Siena and the future pope Pius III) in 1492. It was intended as a repository of the books and the manuscript collection of his uncle cardinal Enea Silvio Piccolomini, eventually Pope Pius II. This collection included works by his uncle, books in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, and many rare parchments. Today, many of the original collection has been lost, but the library still houses many exquistete illuminated Psalters ‘by Liberale da Verona and Girolamo da Cremona were executed between 1466 and 1478 and later carried on by other Sienese illuminators’. 

Adjoined to the left-side of the cathedral, the entrance is set apart by a large marble wall monument, with two grand arches. This marble entrance was constructed by Lorenzo di Mariano in 1497. It contains a round relief of &quot;St. John the Evangelist&quot; (probably) by Giovanni di Stefano and, below the altar, a polychrome &quot;Pietà&quot; by the sculptor Alberto di Betto da Assisi in 1421. Above this marble monument is a fresco of the &quot;Papal Coronation of Pius III&quot; by Pinturicchio in 1504. 

Entering the room, there is an unmistakable stylistic shift within the library, compared to the rest of the cathedral; whereas the cathedral is more somber and dark, the library is filled with light and bright colors. Much of the color comes from the many frescos that cover the entirety of the walls and ceilings. 

The walls are covered with frescoes depicting the ten most important scenes from the life of Pope Pius II, to whom the library is dedicated. Pinturicchio painted this cycle of frescoes around the library between 1502 and 1507, representing Raphael and himself in several of them. There is some controversy whether these frescos were based, at least partially, on designs by Raphael. This masterpiece is full of striking detail and vivacious colours. Each scene is explained in Latin by the text below, and demonstrate the remarkable events from the secular and religious career of pope Pius II, first as a high prelate, then bishop, a cardinal and ultimately pope:

# Enea Silvio Piccolomini (ESP) leaves for the Council of Basel. The storm scene in the background is a first in western art.

# ESP, ambassador at the Scottish Court
# ESP crowned court poet by emperor Frederick III
# ESP makes an act of submission to Pope Eugene IV
# ESP, bishop of Siena, presents emperor Frederick III with his bride-to-be Eleanora of Portugal at the Porta Camollia in Siena.
# ESP receives the cardinal&#x27;s hat in 1456
# ESP, enters the Lateran as pontiff in 1458
# Pius II convokes a Diet of Princes at Mantua to proclaim a new crusade in 1459
# Pius II canonizes Saint Catherine of Siena in 1461
# Pius II arrives in Ancona to launch the crusade.

The ceiling is decorated in four panels, which each contain mythological subjects and are boarded by colorful, geometric patterns. They were executed between 1502 and 1503 by Pinturicchio and his assistants. The floor, made of blue ceramics with crescent moons, adds another element of color to the room. In the center of the room is a marble statue of three smiling women with entwined arms, who are personifications of the three graces. Originally a Greek painting, the famous statue &quot;Three Graces&quot; is a Roman copy that was bought specifically to be placed in the library.

== Baptistry ==

Unlike Florence or Pisa, Siena did not build a separate baptistry. The baptistry is located underneath the eastern bays of the choir of the Duomo. The construction of the interior was largely performed under Camaino di Crescentino and was completed about 1325. The main attraction is the hexagonal baptismal font, containing sculptures by Donatello, Jacopo della Quercia and others.

== Crypt ==

Located under the Duomo near the baptistry, and rediscovered in 1999 during an excavation, is the cathedral&#x27;s crypt. Although scholars prior to 1999 believed there was a crypt, as recorded in medieval sources, they did know know to what extent this room was preserved. There is evidence that the room was filled with dirt and other material waste in the beginning of the 15th century, with more deposits added in the first half of the 18th century. The room was decorated towards the end of the 13th century by a series of frescos, which survive today in vivid color. These frescos, covering each wall as well as the two pillars supporting the room, depict forty-five scenes from the Old and New Testaments. These scenes are bordered by geometric patterns and other embellishments.

<text>Wayne Michael Coyne (born January 13, 1961) is an American musician. He is the founder, lead vocalist, main songwriter, and only constant member of the psychedelic rock band the Flaming Lips.

==Early life==
Coyne was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, the son of Thomas Coyne and Dolores &quot;Dolly&quot; Jackson. The fifth of six children of an Irish Catholic family, Coyne moved with his family from Pittsburgh&#x27;s Troy Hill neighborhood to Oklahoma in early 1961. Coyne grew up in Oklahoma City. Coyne preferred listening to music and playing pickup football. He, his sister, and his brothers dubbed themselves &quot;The Fearless Freaks&quot; for their brutal backyard football games. Tommy Coyne, Wayne&#x27;s older brother, described the games as a &quot;semi-civilized gang fight.&quot;

In 1977, while in high school, Coyne began working as a fry cook for a Long John Silver&#x27;s restaurant in Oklahoma City. During his second year of employment, there was a rash of robberies in Oklahoma City. The restaurant was robbed and Coyne and other employees were held at gunpoint and forced to lie on the ground. Coyne was certain he was going to die. The assistant manager could not open the restaurant&#x27;s safe, however, and the robbers eventually fled the scene. Coyne believes &quot;this is really how you die...one minute you&#x27;re just cooking up someone&#x27;s order of French fries and the next minute you&#x27;re laying on the floor and they blow your brains out. There&#x27;s no music, there&#x27;s no significance, it&#x27;s just random.&quot; Coyne continued working at Long John Silver&#x27;s until 1990.

==With the Flaming Lips==
Coyne formed the Flaming Lips in 1983 with brother Mark singing lead, Michael Ivins on bass guitar, and Richard English on drums. Mark later left the band and Wayne assumed vocal duties. Wayne is the only constant member of the band since its founding. According to allmusic.com Coyne &quot;became the primary singer and songwriter&quot; of the band. According to an article in the September 16th, 1993 issue of Rolling Stone Mark and Wayne Coyne came up with the name &quot;The Flaming Lips&quot; as a reference to a rumor of a high school classmate who contracted genital herpes after receiving cunnilingus from a partner with active cold sores. Wayne remarked on this unsubstantiated claim:When Mark and I were in, I think it was Junior Year in High School, there was a rumor about this girl who got herpes from this guy at a party. He went down on her with a cold sore. I don&#x27;t think we knew the girl, and I&#x27;m not sure if she even existed, you know how kids just spread bullshit. But when we were thinking of band names one night over a pack of Schlitz and some left-handed cigarettes and remembered how we joked that they both had &quot;Flaming Lips&quot; and it just stuck.During large-crowd festival performances, Coyne makes his entrance by descending from an alien mother ship (a nod to Parliament-Funkadelic) in a bubble and floats across the audience. Coyne has also been known to pour fake blood down his face via a hidden tube during live shows. Coyne does this to pay homage to a famous picture of Miles Davis who, after a performance, had blood on his suit because a police officer had beaten him during the show.

Flaming Lips concerts also feature confetti cannons, lasers, laser pointers, images projected on to a screen, dozens of large balloons, a stage filled with dancers dressed as aliens, yetis, the gloves etc. Before performing, Coyne can be seen helping the stage crew. Their performances have been likened to psychedelic experiences rather than simply music shows, a tradition that goes back to the band&#x27;s formation.

== Experimental art==

In 1996 and 1997, Coyne developed &quot;The Parking Lot Experiments,&quot; where forty different tapes were distributed. The band instructed forty cars to start the tapes at the same time, resulting in a surround sound. Over 1,000 people gathered in a parking lot for this experiment.

The parking lot experiments led to the experimental album &quot;Zaireeka&quot;, which is made up of four stereo tracks, each on four different CDs. The four CDs are meant to be played simultaneously in order to hear the complete tracks. Coyne believes Zaireeka embraces &quot;...a kind of anarchy in art. It was like an art happening – you have to bring four sound systems together. Sometimes you get great synchronicity; other times, it sounds haphazard. You get to hear music in a whole new way.&quot;

At the New Year&#x27;s Eve Freakout in Oklahoma City on January 1, 2010, Coyne instructed the audience to set their cell phone alarms for 12:55 a.m. When the alarms went off, the alarm sounds were drowned out by cheering. Coyne remarked that &quot;someone has a loud fucking iPhone.&quot;

In October 2010, Coyne created a screen print using his own blood. The poster commemorated The Flaming Lips&#x27; appearance at the Austin City Limits Music Festival. It has a picture of a skull drawn in a Wes Wilson style. Coyne printed it using his blood collected in a vial. The frontman stated, &quot;We thought it would be silly to use chicken blood or something, they don&#x27;t need to sacrifice their vital fluids any more than I need to&quot;

In February 2017, Coyne debuted an art exhibit at the Waterloo Center for the Arts in Waterloo, Iowa called &quot;Works by Wayne Coyne&quot;. The exhibit featured &quot;The King&#x27;s Mouth,&quot; a 14-minute light attraction to enter and enjoy.

==Directorial debut==
Coyne began making his science fiction film, &quot;Christmas on Mars&quot;, in 2001. It was a low budget project and principal photography was shot on a set in his backyard. The different parts of the spaceship set were built by Coyne.

The film tells the story of the first Christmas on a colonized Mars. In the film, Coyne plays a super-being who is curious about a baby being born on Mars.

&quot;Christmas on Mars&quot; was shown for the first time at the Sasquatch! Music Festival in a circus tent. The Flaming Lips took the tent on tour, showing the movie after each performance. &quot;The concept was to come up with another one of those midnight movies, like &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; that I went to see as a teenager, all toked up, before the days of cable.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Coyne lives on a compound of four houses in the same neighborhood in which he grew up. Each Halloween, Coyne dresses up to scare trick-or-treaters who come to his home. He feels that it is good to scare children, because when they grow older, there are things &quot;that are horribly scary . . . you can&#x27;t just run away from them or turn on a light and it runs away.&quot; Though an atheist, Coyne states: &quot;I wish I did believe in God. It would be a great relief to think, &#x27;God&#x27;ll take care of it. God&#x27;ll put gas in the car tomorrow.&#x27;&quot;

In 2012 Coyne separated from his common-law wife, J. Michelle Martin-Coyne. In September 2013, Martin-Coyne filed for divorce on the grounds of &quot;irreconcilable incompatibility.&quot; The two had no children together and disagree on how long they lived together (Martin-Coyne claiming since 1989, Coyne since 2004).

Coyne began dating Katy Weaver in 2012. The two got engaged in September 2018 and in November 2018 announced they were expecting their first child together. They got married January 5, 2019, in downtown Oklahoma City. In June 2019, Coyne and Weaver welcomed their first child, a son, named Bloom Bobby Coyne. On March 13, 2022, the Coynes announced the arrival of a second son named Rex Roses Coyne.

<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
Colonia Dignidad (&quot;&#x27;&quot;Dignity Colony&#x27; or &#x27;Colony of Dignity&#x27;) was an isolated colony established in post-World War II Chile by emigrant Germans which became notorious for the internment, torture, and murder of dissidents during the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet in the 1970s while under the leadership of German emigrant preacher Paul Schäfer. Colonia Dignidad has been described as a &quot;state within a state&quot;.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt; Schäfer and members of the colony were deeply religious and followed the teachings of William Branham. The main legal economic activity of the colony was agriculture; at various periods it also was home to a school, a hospital, two airstrips, a restaurant, and a power station.
Colonia Dignidad&#x27;s longest continuous leader, Paul Schäfer, arrived in the colony in 1961. Schäfer was a fugitive, accused of child molestation in West Germany. The organization he led in Chile was described, alternatively, as a cult or as a group of &quot;harmless eccentrics&quot;. The organization was secretive, and the Colonia was surrounded by barbed wire fences, featured a watchtower and searchlights, and was later reported to contain secret weapon caches. External investigations, including efforts by the Chilean government, uncovered a history of criminal activity in the enclave, including child sexual abuse. Reports from Chile&#x27;s National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation indicate that a small set of the many individuals abducted by Pinochet&#x27;s Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional during his rule were held as prisoners at Colonia Dignidad, most of whom were subjected to torture, and often to extrajudicial execution as well. Several members of Colonia&#x27;s leadership of the time, including Schäfer, were participants in the atrocities.

In 1991, the name of the settlement was changed to Villa Baviera. After Schäfer fled to Argentina in 1996 to escape child molestation charges in Chile, control over residents loosened. Residents of the colony are now free to leave, and the site is open for tourism.

==Location ==
Located in a remote area in the Maule Region of central Chile, Colonia Dignidad was located in the commune of Parral, in a rural area on the north bank of the Perquilauquén River, about 35 km southeast of the town of Parral. The full name of the colony from the 1950s was Sociedad Benefactora y Educacional Dignidad (&quot;Charitable and Educational Society &#x27;Dignity&#x27;&quot;). At its largest, Colonia Dignidad was home to some three hundred German and Chilean residents, and covered .

==History==
The first inhabitants of Colonia Dignidad arrived in 1961, brought by German citizen Paul Schäfer. Born in 1921 in the town of Troisdorf, Schäfer&#x27;s first employment in Germany was as a welfare worker for children in an institution of the local church. He was fired from that post at the end of the 1940s and faced accusations of sexual abuse against children in his care. While these first reports led to his dismissal, no criminal proceedings were initiated.

Schäfer had been following the ministry of William Branham from Germany, and was very excited when Branham made a personal visit to Germany in 1955. Schäfer and other members of his church served as William Branham&#x27;s personal security detail on his 1955 European tour. One sermon during his visit to Karlsruhe, Germany, left a deep impression on Schäfer. Schäfer claimed to experience a healing in the meeting, and thereafter began to strongly teach some of Branham&#x27;s key doctrines. Following the 1955 meetings with Branham, Schäfer began to put more of William Branham&#x27;s doctrines into practice in his group, and began to insist to his followers that they were the &quot;only faithful ones&quot; to William Branham&#x27;s teachings.

Working as an independent preacher, Schäfer formed a community in Gronau dedicated to working with children at risk. He quickly acquired great influence over his members, who had to perform hard farm work without pay. Shortly thereafter, stories reemerged relating to the earlier allegations of pedophilia against him. As a result, in 1961, Schäfer organized the emigration of several hundred members of their community to Chile.

&quot;Strong ties were forged&quot; between Schäfer, William Branham, and Ewald Frank during Branham&#x27;s time in Germany. Schäfer may have been influenced to move to Chile by Branham&#x27;s doomsday prophesies that predicted the imminent destruction of western democracies. Schäfer continued to promote Branham&#x27;s teaching throughout his life, and many escapees and the current members of Colonia are still affiliated with the teachings of Branham.

Ewald Frank was a key figure in helping Colonia establish its weapons factories by contracting with German arms producers to assist the colony in setting up their operations. Frank also played a role in assisting in the sale and transport of the materials and supplies for the operations in Colonia. When investigations were launched into Colonia in later years, many members of the colony fled back to Germany where they found refuge with Frank. Schäfer maintained connections to Branham until the time of his death in a car accident in 1965.

=== Allegations against the colony ===
To the outside world, the colony portrayed itself as a prime example of German efficiency, cleanliness and communal work. The profitable agricultural production and an attached charity hospital helped preserve this image for a long time. The colony had its own press operations which recorded and broadcast videos showing their happy residents amid celebrations and commemorations: men dedicated to farm work, women and girls embroidering or preparing butter. Diplomats at the German embassy ignored reports of the violence and crime and praised it as a “model colony”.

However, Schäfer&#x27;s propaganda efforts were again and again overshadowed by allegations of people escaping from the colony and obtaining asylum in Germany. The earliest known example was Wolfgang Müller, who fled in 1966 and first exposed the atrocities that occurred within the colony. Müller obtained German citizenship and worked for a newspaper, soon becoming an activist in Germany against the leaders of &quot;Colonia Dignidad&quot;. He eventually became the president of a foundation dedicated to the support of Schäfer&#x27;s victims in Chile.

In 1967, Schäfer freed another inhabitant of the colony, Heinz Kuhn, who confirmed the allegations previously made by Müller, and provided more information on abuses. However, these first allegations were rejected by politicians and were emphatically denied due to their ties with the management of the Colony in their preparation of the military coup of September 11, 1973, as demonstrated later in Chilean court cases.

In 1988, Georg and Lotti Packmor escaped and testified in a parliamentary hearing in Bonn, Germany, that German citizens were forced to live in the enclave against their will.

=== Secret detention camp ===

Before officially moving his organization to Chile, Paul Schäfer requested that the Chilean government exempt him from paying taxes and grant him asylum as long as he helped with gaining political intelligence. The Rettig Commission noted a wealth of information supporting the accusations of the use of the land owned by Colonia Dignidad for detention and torture of political detainees during Pinochet&#x27;s military dictatorship. Among these sources are spokesmen for the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, and the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. The Rettig Commission ultimately based its conclusions on evidence that it examined directly.

In these underground prisons, the captives were tortured in numerous ways, including mutilation from dogs and electric shocks. Some torture victims allege that Schäfer was directly involved in their torture. There is speculation that the extent of Schäfer&#x27;s involvement with Pinochet has not yet been fully disclosed. Schäfer&#x27;s 2005 arrest saw more than 500 government files of missing detainees hidden in the (potato cellar in English). Each of these files contained details of severe human rights violations committed under Schäfer&#x27;s supervision in collaboration with Pinochet. In the late 1970s, Pinochet allegedly ordered for the mass graves containing hundreds of murdered detainees to be unearthed and for the bodies to be either thrown into the sea or burned.

=== Claims of German Intelligence Service assistance ===
Journalist John Dinges has suggested that there was some degree of cooperation between the German Intelligence Service, German arms dealer Gerhard Mertins, and Colonia Dignidad, including creation of bunkers, tunnels, a hospital, and runways for the decentralized production of armaments in modules (parts produced in one place, other parts in another). This subject was proactively hidden, because of the problems experienced at the time associated with Argentina.

=== Army base ===
Because of Colonia Dignidad&#x27;s close association with the Chilean military and strategic proximity to the Argentina–Chile border, the Colonia served as a base for the Chilean military during the 1978 Beagle conflict between Chile and Argentina. The hospital at Colonia Dignidad also served as a laboratory for the manufacture of weaponized sarin as part of the Pinochet government&#x27;s Project Andrea.

=== Democratic transition ===
Chile turned to democracy in 1990 after 17 years of dictatorship, but &quot;Colonia Dignidad&quot; remained unchanged. Allegations of abuses and humiliations that occurred inside the colony increased. National and international pressure intensified, but each time the police tried to conduct an investigation at the site they were greeted with a wall of silence. &quot;Colonia Dignidad&quot; authorities remained powerful and also had allies in the army and among the Chilean far right, who would warn them in advance when the police were preparing to visit the site.

Slowly, Chilean public awareness began to change, creating a growing feeling of resentment towards the place, which many began to perceive as an independent state, or an enclave within Chile.

== Life under Schäfer’s leadership==

Before coming to Chile, Schäfer had attempted to start an orphanage in Germany, but two mothers living there accused him of molesting their children, so to escape judicial consequences, he fled to Chile. Schäfer arrived in Chile in 1961 with around 70 followers, and a number of kidnapped children. The colony continued to &#x27;import&#x27; children from Germany and the surrounding areas until the end of Schäfer&#x27;s leadership. Colonia Dignidad grew to have about 350 people, around 100 of whom were children. Those on the side of the colony said that it was a harmless organization, but, those against it recounted it as tyrannical in structure, and highly restrictive in terms of interaction between genders and in expression of sexuality, with a reportedly aging population. The perimeter of the colony was made up of barbed wire, searchlights, and a watchtower. Today the colony is not as isolated as it was under Schäfer&#x27;s leadership; Schäfer made great efforts to keep the colony as isolated as he could. The road to the colony cut through farmland and forest, and brought the traveler to a large barbed-wire fence that was generally heavily protected. Inside, however, the colony seemed fairly normal, though a bit old-fashioned:The village had modern apartment complexes, two schools, a chapel, several meetinghouses, and a bakery that produced fresh cakes, breads, and cheeses. There were numerous animal stables, two landing strips, at least one airplane, a hydroelectric power station, and mills and factories of various kinds, including a highly profitable gravel mill that supplied raw materials for numerous road-building projects throughout Chile. On the north side of the village was a hospital, where the Germans provided free care to thousands of patients in one of the country&#x27;s poorest areas.Schäfer, despite living in Chile for most of his adult life, spoke little Spanish, as only German was spoken inside the colony. He was described as having a very serious demeanor, and rarely smiled, but was considered to be quite charismatic nonetheless. He made great efforts to illustrate Colonia Dignidad as a utopian paradise, seemingly frozen in a time before World War II. In reality, Schäfer ran a fear-based colony where members were barred from interacting with the world outside the community, and a few were armed to protect the community against possible outside attacks. The inhabitants lived under an abnormal authoritarian system, where in addition to minimal contact with the outside, Schäfer ordered the division of families (parents did not talk to their children, or did not know their siblings). It prohibited all kinds of relations, sentimental or conjugal, among adult women and men, and segregated the living quarters of each sex. Schäfer sexually abused children and some were tortured, as is clear from the statements of the German Dr. Gisela Seewald, who admitted the use of electroshock therapy and sedatives that her boss had claimed were placebos. Members were often encouraged to confess to him both their own sins, and the sins of others that they had witnessed. Supposed sinners were often publicly outed and shamed during gathering times and meals. Women were thought to be inherently sinful, plagued by sexuality, thus the justification behind separating the men from the women.

Schäfer often dictated forming romantic relationships, as far as saying when to get married and have children. Most of the time, however, conceptions of the family inside the colony were based not on genetics, but on loyalty to Schäfer, who self-identified as &quot;The Permanent Uncle.&quot; When children were born, they would be raised by nurses in groups segregated by sex rather than their biological parents. Males would initially be placed in a group called &quot;The Babies&quot;, then advance to &quot;The Wedges&quot; by age 6, &quot;The Army of Salvation&quot; by 15, &quot;The Elder Servants&quot; by the mid-30s, and lastly, &quot;The Comalos&quot; by 50. Females were divided into &quot;The Dragons,&quot; &quot;The Field Mice,&quot; &quot;The Women&#x27;s Group,&quot; and &quot;The Grannies&quot; at the same respective ages. This was done in an effort to give everyone an exact role in the colony&#x27;s order. Group members shared living spaces of about six to one room, and all wore similar German 30s-style clothing. Each person would work 12+ hours a day, receiving no payment, but doing so rather for the sake of Colonia Dignidad.

The colony had a school and hospital in the enclave which offered support to rural families through free education and health services. This would, ultimately, create support in case the colony was attacked. However, there are many cases uncovered in recent years that refer to illegal adoptions of children from families residing in the surrounding areas by the German hierarchy in order to deliver on the promise of free education. Locals around the colony generally knew Colonia Dignidad to be made up of hygienic, hard-working individuals who led a very structured life.

==Atrocities==
===Sexual abuse===
In 1996, Schäfer fled child sex abuse charges in Chile, escaping arrest until 2005. The previous year, in his absence, a Chilean court had convicted him of child abuse, together with 26 other cult members. In 2006, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He died in prison of a heart ailment, on 24 April 2010, at the age of 88. At the time of his death, he was still under investigation for the 1985 disappearance of mathematician Boris Weisfeiler, an American citizen who went missing while hiking near Colonia Dignidad.

===Torture and murder===
During the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, from 1973 to 1990, Colonia Dignidad served as a special torture center. In 1991, Chile&#x27;s National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation concluded that a number of people apprehended by the DINA were held at Colonia Dignidad, and that some of the colony&#x27;s residents actively helped the DINA torture some of the captives. Colonia Dignidad&#x27;s involvement came to light as early as an October 1976 report from the United Nations Ad Hoc Working Group on Chile, as referenced in a March 1977 Amnesty International report, &quot;Disappeared Prisoners in Chile&quot;, with the latter report describing the evidence in this way:

 Prisoners being tortured in the tunnels under Colonia Dignidad were each interrogated to gain an understanding of their personality in order to gauge the appropriate torture technique. These techniques led to a number of afflictions lasting indeterminate periods of time. As many as 100 of the citizens taken to Colonia Dignidad by the DINA were murdered at the colony.

There are more than 1,100 desaparecidos (disappeared people) in Chile, some taken to the Colony where they were tortured and killed. One of them is a U.S. citizen, Boris Weisfeiler, a Soviet-born mathematics professor at Pennsylvania State University. Weisfeiler, then 43 years old, vanished while on a hiking trip near the border between Chile and Argentina in the early part of January 1985. It is presumed that Weisfeiler had been kidnapped and taken to the Colony where he was tortured and killed. In 2012, a judge in Chile ordered the arrest of eight former police and army officials over the kidnapping of Weisfeiler during the Pinochet years, citing evidence from declassified US files. In 2016, the case was closed and the men were freed when a judge ruled that Weisfeiler had indeed been abducted, but that it was only a common crime, long past the statute of limitations, instead of a human rights violation.

===Member abuse===
Some defectors from the colony have portrayed it as a cult in which the leader Paul Schäfer held the ultimate power. They claim that the residents were never allowed to leave the colony, and that they were strictly segregated by gender. Television, telephones and calendars were banned. Residents worked wearing Bavarian peasant garb and sang German folk songs. Sex was banned, with some residents forced to take drugs to reduce their desires. Drugs were also administered as a form of sedation, mostly to young girls, but to males as well. Severe discipline in the forms of beatings and torture was commonplace: Schäfer insisted that discipline was spiritually enriching.
One of the first instances of abuse allegations was in 1966 from escapee Wolfgang Müller, who had been sixteen when he came to the colony. He claimed that he was forced into slave labor, received regular harsh beatings, and was molested by Schäfer on multiple occasions. Müller said that former Nazis were part of the colony as well.

===Weapons violations===

In June and July 2005, Chilean police found two large illegal arms caches in or around the colony. The first, within the colony itself, included three containers with machine guns, automatic rifles, rocket launchers, and large quantities of ammunition, some as many as forty years old but with evidence of recent maintenance. This cache was described as the largest arsenal ever found in private hands in Chile. The second cache, outside a restaurant operated by the colony, included rocket launchers and grenades.

In January 2005, former Chilean secret police operative Michael Townley, then living in the United States under a witness-protection program, acknowledged to agents of Interpol Chile links between DINA and Colonia Dignidad. Townley also revealed information about Colonia Dignidad and the army&#x27;s Laboratory on Bacteriological Warfare. This last laboratory would have replaced the old DINA laboratory at Vía Naranja de Lo Curro hill, where Townley worked with the chemist Eugenio Berríos. Townley also gave proof of biological experiments, related to the two aforementioned laboratories, on political prisoners at Colonia Dignidad.

===Nazi ties===

The Central Intelligence Agency and Simon Wiesenthal claim that Josef Mengele, the infamous Nazi concentration camp doctor, known as the &quot;Angel of Death&quot; for his lethal experiments on human subjects was present at the colony. The colony itself rejected the accusation when Wiesenthal published it in 1997 in the Chilean press. The German government states that to this date, there is &quot;no evidence to support or invalidate Wiesenthal&#x27;s claim or the more general allegation that the Colonia Dignidad or its legal successors was a place of refuge for Nazi criminals. 

The Nazi underground in South America was established some time before World War II. Juan Perón provided shelter to some escaped Nazi criminals. Nazi sympathy in South America decreased until Pinochet took power. It was suggested that part of the intense racism, anti-Semitism, and classism in Chile can be attributed to Nazi presence.

The high concentration of Germans in Chile shaped the country&#x27;s overall attitude towards subjects like education and military. A few of the Germans who immigrated to Chile in the 1960s were former Nazis led by Paul Schäfer. Colonia Dignidad was a “Nazi stronghold protected by the Chilean government[...].” Former members of the SS and Gestapo had the job of demonstrating Nazi torture methods to the secret police of Chile. Many of Schäfer&#x27;s followers who had Nazi pasts joined him to escape post-World War II war crime investigations. The presence of Colonia Dignidad had an effect on the general political opinion of the surrounding areas, and the government as well because of this, considering the political ties between Colonia Dignidad and the Chilean government.

==Legal proceedings==
In 2004, a Chilean court convicted Schäfer and 26 other cult members of child abuse. In 2006, Schäfer was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

In early 2011, Hartmut Hopp, considered to be Schäfer&#x27;s &quot;right-hand-man&quot; at Colonia Dignidad, was placed under house arrest in Chile while awaiting trial for human rights crimes. In May 2011, Hopp fled Chile on board a helicopter, later making his way to Germany. In June 2016, prosecutors in Germany petitioned a court to enforce a 5-year prison sentence that Hopp was sentenced to in absentia in Chile. In May 2019, German prosecutors announced that they had dropped their investigation into Hopp and Reinhard Döring. In January 2020, a lawyer for the victims, Petra Schlagenhauf, lodged a complaint seeking to have the investigation reopened.

Hopp and other alleged accomplices in Schäfer&#x27;s crimes who were charged and awaiting trial took refuge in Ewald Frank&#x27;s church in Germany, where they were protected from extradition. Frank is a leader of William Branham&#x27;s followers in Germany. German protestors picketed in front of Frank&#x27;s church to protest his actions. The government of Chile banned Ewald Frank from entering the country after finding he had been visiting and holding revival meetings with Schäfer&#x27;s followers at Colonia. Schäfer&#x27;s followers speculated to news reporters that Frank and Schäfer had known each other since the 1950s when they were both at Branham&#x27;s European campaign meetings together.

At the time that Hopp fled Chile, 10 other cult members were out on bail awaiting trial on various charges. Fearing that they would also flee the country, their bail was immediately revoked and they were taken into custody.

In 2010, Chilean authorities opened an investigation into the events occurring in the colony during the 1990s, resulting 19 months later in the Supreme Court issuing a unanimous ruling to prosecute 16 Chilean and German members of the colony. On 28 January 2013, six former leaders of the colony were sentenced to prison, while the remaining 10 were found guilty of lesser crimes and given probationary sentences.

In March 2017, the German Bundestag officially acknowledged the responsibility of Germany and the failure of the German foreign policy regarding the Colonia Dignidad and members of all the parties in the German parliament passed a resolution giving the government a year to come up with plans to investigate the history of the colony, establish a memorial, and offer assistance to victims and family members.

==Villa Baviera era==


In 1991, the name of the settlement was changed to &quot;Villa Baviera&quot;. Residents of the colony are now allowed free ingress and egress, and some study at university. As of 2019 Villa Baviera is operated as a tourist resort, something that has been the subject of controversy from human rights activists.

When the transition of the colony first started, many of the former victims protested in front of the &quot;Villa Baviera&quot;, attached photos of the murdered and disappeared on the fence and compared the use of the former torture site to &quot;installing a McDonald&#x27;s in Auschwitz&quot;. 

In October 2005, the Chilean government sent a team of coordinators to the colony whose task it was to make sure the inhabitants would be fully integrated into Chilean society. Their main advice was to modernize the estate, so the inhabitants could gain their livelihood within the premises. One of the ideas was to turn the facilities into a &quot;wellness-farm with hot springs and organic yoghurt production&quot;.

<text>Goosebumps is a series of children&#x27;s horror novels written by American author R. L. Stine. The protagonists in these stories are teens or pre-teens who find themselves in frightening circumstances, often involving the supernatural, the paranormal or the occult. Between 1992 and 1997, sixty-two books were published under the &quot;Goosebumps&quot; umbrella title. R. L. Stine also wrote various spin-off series, including, &quot;Goosebumps Series 2000&quot;, &quot;Give Yourself Goosebumps&quot;, &quot;Tales to Give You Goosebumps&quot;, &quot;Goosebumps Triple Header&quot;, &quot;Goosebumps HorrorLand&quot;, &quot;Goosebumps Most Wanted&quot; and &quot;Goosebumps SlappyWorld&quot;. Additionally, there was a series called &quot;Goosebumps Gold&quot; that was never released.

&quot;Goosebumps&quot; has spawned a pair of television series, a video games series, a comic series and merchandise, as well as a pair of feature films, which star Jack Black as a fictionalized version of Stine.

The series was originally published in English by Scholastic Press in the United States and Scholastic Hippo in the United Kingdom. Spanning various genres, including horror, comedy, fantasy, adventure, supernatural fiction, thriller and mystery, the world of &quot;Goosebumps&quot; explores a multitude of themes.

Since the release of its first novel, &quot;Welcome to Dead House&quot;, in July 1992, the books have achieved immense popularity, garnered positive reviews, and achieved commercial success worldwide. They have captivated a diverse audience, including children and older readers, and have sold over 400 million copies globally in 35 languages as of October 2022, becoming the second-best-selling book series in history (behind &quot;Harry Potter&quot;). At one point, the series held the distinction of being the best-selling book series of all time, selling over 4 million books a month during its prime. Individual books in the series have been listed in several bestseller lists, including the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for children.

==Structure and genre==
The &quot;Goosebumps&quot; series falls under many genres but mainly horror and thriller, although Stine characterizes the series as &#x27;scary books that are also funny&#x27;. Each book features different child characters and settings. The primary protagonists are middle class and can be either male or female. In &quot;Goosebumps&quot; stories, the central characters are often placed in remote or isolated locations, diverging from common societal conventions. This can range anywhere from comfortable suburban areas to boarding schools, foreign villages or campsites. Books typically feature characters who either recently moved to a new neighborhood or are sent to stay with relatives.
The books in the &quot;Goosebumps&quot; series feature similar plot structures with children being involved in scary situations. At his peak, Stine was known to complete these stories extremely quickly, some of which were written in only six days. The books are mostly written in first person narrative, often concluding with twist endings. They contain surreal horror, with characters encountering the strange and supernatural.

The author has plot devices he follows throughout his &quot;Goosebumps&quot; books. Stine says he does not have any death in his stories, and the children in his novels are never put into situations that would be considered too serious. He attributed the success of his books to their absence of drugs, and violence.

All &quot;Goosebumps&quot; books are written at a reading level ranging from 3rd to 7th grade (8-12 years old, in the US education system).

==Inspiration and themes==
According to the documentary &quot;Tales from the Crypt: From Comic Books to Television&quot;, R.L. Stine said that he remembered reading the popular/infamous &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; comic books when he was young and credited as one of his inspirations. Books and characters in the series were inspired by books and films. For example, the character Slappy the Dummy was inspired by the literary classic &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;. Some of Stine&#x27;s ideas for the books also came from real life; Stine got the idea for the book &quot;The Haunted Mask&quot; after his son, Matt, had a Halloween mask he had trouble getting off. Stine also uses his childhood fears to help him write his books. The author said, &quot;Luckily, I have a great memory. As I write a story, I can remember what it feels like to be afraid and panicky&quot;. Stine states he often thinks of a title to a novel first, then lets the title lead him to a story.

Two common themes in the series are children triumphing over evil and children facing horrid or frightening situations and using their own wit and imagination to escape them. Stine does not attempt to incorporate moral lessons into his novels, and says his books are &quot;strictly reading motivation&quot;.

==Original &quot;Goosebumps&quot; series==

Following the success of Stine&#x27;s young adult horror novels, the co-founder of Parachute Press (the company that developed the series), Joan Waricha, persuaded him to write scary books for younger children. Stine says the name for the book series came to him after he saw a TV station&#x27;s ad in &quot;TV Guide&quot; that stated &quot;It&#x27;s goosebumps week on Channel 11&quot;. He originally signed a six-book deal with the publisher Scholastic, but went on to write 62 books in the original series, the first book being &quot;Welcome to Dead House&quot;, released in July 1992. The series was originally aimed at girls, but both boys and girls enjoyed the series equally with half of Stine&#x27;s fan mail being sent from boys. The cover illustrations for this series was done primarily by Tim Jacobus. Thirty-two of the books from the original series were later re-released with new artwork under the &quot;Classic Goosebumps&quot; rename.

==Spin-off series==
The books in the &quot;Tales to Give You Goosebumps&quot; and &quot;Goosebumps Triple Header&quot; series were written as short story anthologies, featuring a collection of stories in each book. From 1994 to 1997, six &quot;Tales to Give You Goosebumps&quot; books were published. Two &quot;Goosebumps Triple Header&quot; books were released from 1997 to 1998, beginning with &quot;Three Shocking Tales of Terror: Book 1&quot;.

Fifty &quot;Give Yourself Goosebumps&quot; books were published from 1995 to 2000, starting with &quot;Escape from the Carnival of Horrors&quot;. The books in this series were written as gamebooks, featuring multiple endings. The books in this series were ghostwritten by several authors, including Kathryn Lance and Stine&#x27;s sister-in-law Megan Stine. Many of the cover illustrations for this series were done by Mark Nagata.

Due to declining &quot;Goosebumps&quot; sales and increasing competition (primarily from another series from Scholastic, Animorphs), Scholastic and R. L. Stine decided to create &quot;Goosebumps Series 2000&quot;. From 1998 to 2000, 25 books in the series were published, beginning with &quot;Cry of the Cat&quot;. The books in this series were written in a similar format and featured similar content to the original series, but Stine classified them as being &quot;much scarier&quot;. The covers in this series were illustrated by Tim Jacobus.

The books in the &quot;Goosebumps Gold&quot; series appeared on illustrator Tim Jacobus&#x27;s website and marketing sites but were never released. In this series, Stine intended to write a sequel to &quot;The Haunted Mask II&quot; (&quot;The Haunted Mask Lives!&quot;), and a sequel to &quot;Welcome to Dead House&quot; (&quot;Happy Holidays from Dead House&quot;). It was one of the two-book series by Stine that was planned to be released in 2000 (the other was &quot;The Nightmare Room&quot;).

The series was renewed in 2008 following the release of the first book in the &quot;Goosebumps HorrorLand&quot; series, &quot;Revenge of the Living Dummy&quot;, that was published on April 1, 2008. Before the 2008 release of &quot;Revenge of the Living Dummy&quot;, there had not been a &quot;Goosebumps&quot; book published in almost 10 years. Stine decided to start writing &quot;Goosebumps&quot; books again after receiving mail from someone asking him to write new books in the series. Nineteen &quot;Goosebumps HorrorLand&quot; books were published, and books in the series mainly featured two stories. The series continued in 2012 with new stories featuring some of the series&#x27; most memorable villains, including Slappy the Dummy, the Lawn Gnomes and others. The first book of the spin-off series &quot;Goosebumps Most Wanted&quot;, &quot;Planet of the Lawn Gnomes&quot;, was released in October 2012.

In 2024, the series &quot;Goosebumps House of Shivers&quot; started with the first book being: &quot;Scariest. Book. Ever.&quot;

== Achievements, reception and controversy ==
===Achievements===
Following the release of the first novel in the series, the books quickly became popular, selling a million copies a month soon after they first appeared, and four million copies a month by the mid-1990s. Individual &quot;Goosebumps&quot; books appeared in the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for children and the &quot;USA Today&quot; bestseller list. In 2001, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; listed 46 books in the series in its list of bestselling children&#x27;s paperback books of all time. &quot;Goosebumps&quot; was a bestseller in many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Australia.

In 1996, the book series accounted for almost 15% of Scholastic&#x27;s annual revenue. Following the decline of &quot;Goosebumps&quot; sales next year, Scholastic&#x27;s sales had dropped 40%. The decline in &quot;Goosebumps&quot; book sales had made front-page news of most newspaper business sections, which Patrick Jones stated &quot;demonstrates the impact and importance of R. L. Stine. One writer, it seems, influences the fate of an entire company&quot;.

As of 2008, the &quot;Goosebumps&quot; series maintains an 82% brand awareness among children 7–12. It is listed as the number two bestselling children&#x27;s book series of all time and as Scholastic&#x27;s bestselling children&#x27;s book series of all time. By 2014, according to Scholastic, there were 350 million copies of &quot;Goosebumps&quot; books sold in 32 languages, including Chinese, Czech, Spanish, and Hebrew. As of 2008, the book series sells about two million copies annually.

Three books from the &quot;Goosebumps&quot; series have won the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards for Favorite Book: &quot;Deep Trouble&quot; in 1995 (the award category&#x27;s first year), the book &quot;Tales to Give You Goosebumps&quot; in 1996, and &quot;Deep Trouble II&quot; in 1998. In 2000, the series was ranked as the number two children&#x27;s books by the National Education Association, as chosen by children. In 2003, &quot;Goosebumps&quot; was listed at number 188 on the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read poll of the UK&#x27;s 200 &quot;best-loved novels&quot;.

===Reception===
Upon the release of the first book, &quot;Welcome to Dead House&quot;, &quot;Goosebumps&quot; received critical acclaim with many critics and readers praising the series for its dark nature, villains, likable protagonists and for being much more mature compared to other children&#x27;s book series at the time. &quot;Slate&quot;&#x27;s Katy Waldman classified a classic &quot;Goosebumps&quot; story as &quot;funny, icky, and just a bit menacing&quot;. Following the release of the first &quot;Goosebumps HorrorLand&quot; book, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; stated in a starred review that the new &quot;Goosebumps&quot; series was &quot;deliciously chilling&quot;. Two reviewers of the &quot;Goosebumps&quot; books did not feel that the books were high quality literature. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s Marc Silver thought the series was &quot;quite tame&quot;. He called the &quot;Goosebumps&quot; books &quot;subliterature&quot;, stating the plotting in the books was careless and that characters in the stories rarely grew. Roderick McGillis, from the academic journal &quot;&quot;, described the books as camp, writing the books &quot;are so artificial, so formulaic, so predictable, so repetitive&quot;. McGillis also felt that the content of the &quot;Goosebumps&quot; series is &quot;thin in the extreme&quot;.

Stine&#x27;s books have a reputation for getting children excited about reading, which the writer is very proud of. James Carter, writing in &quot;Talking Books: Children&#x27;s Authors Talk About the Craft, Creativity and Process of Writing&quot;, stated &quot;regarding &quot;Point Horrors&quot; and &quot;Goosebumps&quot;, I feel that anything that children read avidly is a good thing&quot;. Librarian and writer Patrick Jones commented that &quot;[t]he real horror is a culture where kids, especially boys, don&#x27;t read—and Stine has done his best to stop that turn of the screw from happening in his lifetime&quot;.

===Book challenges===
&quot;Goosebumps&quot; was listed 15th in the list of most frequently challenged books during 1990–1999 and 94th in the list of top banned/challenged books during 2000–2009 by the American Library Association (ALA). According to the ALA, a challenge is an attempt by a person or group to remove or restrict materials from a library or school curriculum. The series was challenged for being too frightening for young people and depicting occult or demonic themes. By 1997, the ALA was informed of 46 challenges, over 75% of which occurred in school libraries. The rest of the challenges were held in public libraries or the location of the challenges were unknown. The same year, a hearing by the Anoka-Hennepin School District to ban the books was broadcast by C-SPAN. In the hearing, most of the parents and children felt the books should not be banned, and the school district&#x27;s book review committee decided to keep the books.

==Legal dispute==
In November 1996, Scholastic, the publisher of the series, and Parachute Press, the developer of the series, agreed to a new contract. Scholastic retained control of book publishing and the TV series, but gave Parachute Press merchandising rights to the series. In September 1997, following a dispute between Scholastic and Parachute Press, Scholastic accused Parachute Press of violating the contract. Scholastic claimed that Parachute Press had been making merchandising deals and issuing press releases without Scholastic&#x27;s required consent, and had begun withholding payments from them. In November 1997, Parachute responded by alleging Scholastic had repudiated its financial obligations, claiming Scholastic had voided its rights to publish 54 books. Parachute Press filed a lawsuit, which followed with numerous other suits and counter lawsuits over who controls certain rights to the series. In 2003, the two sides reached an agreement, with Scholastic receiving the &quot;Goosebumps&quot; trademark and all other rights to the series for .

<doc id="526853" wikidata="Q641160" url="?curid=526853" title="List of rulers of Provence">
<text>The land of Provence has a history quite separate from that of any of the larger nations of Europe. Its independent existence has its origins in the frontier nature of the dukedom in Merovingian Gaul. In this position, influenced and affected by several different cultures on different sides, the Provençals maintained a unity which was reinforced when the region was made a separate kingdom during the Carolingian decline of the later ninth century. When Boso of Provence acquired the region in 879, it was known as Lower Burgundy until it was merged with Upper Burgundy in 933 to form the Kingdom of Arles. The counts of Arles began calling themselves &quot;count of Provence&quot;; although in name vassals, they were &quot;de facto&quot; autonomous princes. After 1032, the county was part of the Holy Roman Empire.

In the eleventh century, Provence became disputed between the traditional line and the counts of Toulouse, who claimed the title of &quot;Margrave of Provence&quot;. In the High Middle Ages, the title of Count of Provence belonged to local families of Frankish origin, from 1112 to 1245 to the House of Barcelona (a cadet branch of the House of Aragón), from 1245 to 1382 to the House of Anjou, and from 1382 to 1481 to a cadet branch of the House of Valois. It was inherited by King Louis XI of France in 1481, and definitively incorporated into the French royal domain by his son Charles VIII in 1487.

== Merovingian dukes ==
During the period of the Merovingian dynasty in Gaul, Provence was a province ruled by &quot;duces&quot; (dukes), military leaders and district commanders who served as defenders of the frontiers of the kingdom and ruled over vast territories as opposed to the &quot;comites&quot; (counts), who ruled the cities and their environs. Provence was usually a part of the division of the Frankish realm known as the Kingdom of Burgundy, which was treated as its own kingdom. Their title sometimes appears as &quot;rector Provinciae&quot;.

This is an incomplete list of the known Merovingian-appointed dukes of Provence.

*Liberius (until 534), Ostrogothic appointee
*Namatius (bef. 552), Frankish appointee
*Bodegisel (fl. c. 566)
*Adovarius (561–569)
*Lupus (569–570)
*Jovin (570–573)
*Albin (573–575)
*Dinamius (from 575)
*Gondulf (fl. c. 581)
*Leudegisel (fl. c. 585), of Burgundian Provence
*Nicetas (from 587)
*Babo (fl. c. 600)
*Aegyla (fl. c. 602)
*Bado (634–641)
*Willibad (641–643), of Burgundian Provence
*Hector (fl. c. 679)
*Nemfidius (fl. c. 700)
*Antenor (fl. c. 697)
*Metrannus (fl. c. 700)
*Maurontus (c. 720 – 739)
*Abbo (fl. c. 739)

==Carolingian dukes==
Provence was ruled by a poorly known series of dukes during the period of general Carolingian unity until the Treaty of Verdun (843).

*Leibulf (until c. 829)
*Guerin (c. 829 – 845)
*Fulcrad (845 – c. 860)

==Carolingian kings==
After the division of the Carolingian Empire by the Treaty of Verdun (843), the first of the fraternal rulers of the three kingdoms to die was Lothair I, who divided his middle kingdom in accordance with the custom of the Franks among his three sons. Out of this division came the Kingdom of Provence, given to Lothair&#x27;s youngest son, Charles. A heritage of royal rule was thus inaugurated in Provence which, though it was often subsumed into one of its larger neighbouring kingdoms, was just as often proclaiming its own sovereigns.

The kingdom of Provence was also known as Lower Burgundy (or Cisjurane Burgundy). Its capital was first Vienne then Arles.

*Charles of Provence (855–863)&lt;br&gt;&quot;On his death, Provence was divided between his surviving brothers, Lothair II and the Emperor Louis II. The bulk went to Louis.&quot;
*Louis II (863–875), also Holy Roman Emperor from 855&lt;br&gt;&quot;On his death, as with his Kingdom of Italy, Louis&#x27;s Provence went to his uncle Charles the Bald .&quot;
*Charles the Bald (875–877), also Holy Roman Emperor from 875
*Louis the Stammerer (877–879)&lt;br&gt;&quot;With the death of Louis the Stammerer, Provence refused to elect his two sons and instead elected one of their own as king. Boso married Ermengard, daughter of Louis II, to strengthen his and his son&#x27;s claim.&quot;
*Boso (879–887)
*Louis the Blind (887–928), also Holy Roman Emperor from 901 to 905&lt;br&gt;&quot;Louis&#x27;s kingdom did not pass to his heirs, but instead to his brother-in-law, the husband of his sister, Hugh, who had acted as his regent since 905. Hugh never used the royal title in Provence.&quot;
*Hugh (911–933)&lt;br&gt;&quot;In 933, Provence ceased to be a separate kingdom as Hugh exchanged it with Rudolph II of Upper Burgundy for the Iron Crown of Lombardy, that is, rule of Italy.&quot;

==Counts and margraves, within the Empire==
In the aftermath of the death of Louis the Blind, Provence began to be ruled by local counts placed under the authority of a margrave. Firstly, Hugh of Arles served as duke and regent during Louis&#x27; long blindness. Secondly, Hugh gave the march of Vienne and duchy of Provence to Rudolf II of Burgundy in a treaty of 933. Rudolf was never recognised by the nobles of the country and appointed Hugh, Duke of Burgundy, as its first margrave.

At the time, the premier counts in the region were the counts of Arles and those of Avignon. Those who would first bear the title &quot;comes Provinciae&quot; or &quot;count of Provence&quot; descended from one Rotbold of Arles. William I and Rotbold I did not divide their father&#x27;s domains and this indivisibility was maintained by their respective descendants. It is thus impossible to ascertain who succeeded whom in the county as various reigns overlap.

By his marriage to Emma of Provence, daughter of Rotbold II, William III, Count of Toulouse inherited lands and castles in Provence. Emma inherited the title Margrave of Provence upon her elder brother&#x27;s death in 1037. Her son Pons by William III did not survive her, but her grandson did and claimed her title in opposition to the younger line of counts of Provence.

===Bosonid dynasty===


===House of Gévaudan===
===Houses of Barcelona (comital) and Toulouse (margravial)===

With a lack of interest in the &quot;Reconquista&quot; on their southern frontier, the Catalans turned towards their origins, the Mediterranean littoral and northwards. They coveted the region between the Cévennes and the Rhône, then under the control of Toulouse. In 1112, the count of Barcelona, Ramon Berenguer III, married the heiress of Provence, Douce, who was the daughter of the Countess Gerberga of Provence, Gévaudan, Carladais, and part of Rodez. The marriage was probably taken at the urging of the church, which was then in conflict with the House of Toulouse. In 1076, Count Raymond IV was excommunicated, but he still lent his support to Aicard, the deposed archbishop of Arles (since 1080). With the count away on the First Crusade, the church took the opportunity to seize the balance of power in the region. This marriage effectively put Provence under Catalan control.

To accommodate the longstanding claims of the count of Toulouse, in 1125, Raymond&#x27;s heir, Alfonso Jordan, signed a treaty whereby his family&#x27;s traditional claim to the title of &quot;Margrave of Provence&quot; was recognised and the march of Provence was defined as the region north of the lower Durance and on the right of the Rhône, including the castles of Beaucaire, Vallabrègues, and Argence. The region between the Durance, the Rhône, the Alps, and the sea was that of the county and belonged to the house of Barcelona. Avignon, Pont de Sorgues, Caumont and Le Thor remained undivided.

Internally, Provence was racked by uncertainties over rights of succession. Douce and Ramon Berenguer signed all charters jointly until her death in 1127, after which he alone appears as count in all charters until his death in 1131. At that time, Douce&#x27;s younger sister, Stephanie was married to Raymond of Baux, who promptly laid claim to the inheritance of her mother, even though Provence had peacefully passed into the hands of her nephew, Berenguer Ramon I.

===Capetian Angevin dynasty===
*1246–1285 Charles I, Count of Anjou, Maine, Provence and Forcalquier (1246), King of Naples, Sicily (1266) and Jerusalem (1277).
*1285–1309 Charles II of Naples &quot;the Lame&quot;, King of Naples and (nominal) Jerusalem and Sicily, son of Charles I
*1309–1343 Robert of Naples &quot;the Wise&quot;, Duke of Calabria (1296–1309), King of Naples and (nominal) Jerusalem and Sicily (1309), son of Charles II
*1343–1382 Joan I of Naples, Queen of Naples and (nominal) Jerusalem and Sicily (1343–1381)
*1349–1362 Louis I of Naples, King of Naples and (nominal) Jerusalem and Sicily, as husband of Joan I of Naples
:&quot;Queen Joan died heirless, leaving the county to Louis I of Anjou, son of King John II of France &quot;the Good&quot;, of the House of Valois, and great-great-grandson of Charles II of Naples.&quot;

===Valois-Anjou dynasty===
*1382–1384 Louis I of Anjou, Count and then Duke of Anjou (1351), Duke of Calabria and Count of Maine (1356), Duke of Touraine (1370), nominal King of Sicily (1382)
*1384–1417 Louis II of Anjou, Duke of Anjou, Calabria and Touraine, Count of Maine, nominal King of Sicily (1384), Count of Guise (1404), son of Louis I
*1417–1434 Louis III of Anjou, Duke of Anjou and Touraine, nominal King of Sicily (1417), Duke of Calabria (1424), son of Louis II
*1434–1480 René I of Naples &quot;the Good&quot;, Count of Guise (1417–1422), Duke of Lorraine and Bar (1431), King of Naples and (nominal) Sicily and Jerusalem (1434–1442), Duke of Anjou and Touraine (1434), King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona (in dispute, 1466–1472), son of Louis II
*1480–1481 Charles III (V of Maine), also known as Charles of Maine, Count of Maine and Guise (1472), nephew of René I

Upon his death, the heirless Charles du Maine bequeathed the counties of Provence-Forcalquier to King Louis XI of France. From that point forward, the title of Count of Provence simply became one of the many hereditary titles of the French monarchs. The only time the title was used independently afterwards was by the future Louis XVIII of France, who was known as the &quot;Comte de Provence&quot; until the death of his nephew Louis XVII in 1795, after which he claimed the throne of France.

==Mission highlights==

The Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Sciences – 3 (ATLAS-03) was the primary payload aboard STS-66. It continued the series of Spacelab flights to study the energy of the sun and how it affects the Earth&#x27;s climate and environment. The ATLAS-03 mission made the first detailed measurements from the Shuttle of the Northern Hemisphere&#x27;s middle atmosphere in late fall. The timing of the flight, when the Antarctic ozone hole was diminishing, allowed scientists to study possible effects of the ozone hole on mid-latitudes, the way Antarctic air recovers, and how the northern atmosphere changes as the winter season approaches.

In addition to the ATLAS-03 investigations, the mission included deployment and retrieval of the Cryogenic Infrared Spectrometer Telescope for Atmosphere, or CRISTA. Mounted on the Shuttle Pallet Satellite, the payload is designed to explore the variability of the atmosphere and provide measurements that will complement those obtained by the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite launched aboard &quot;Discovery&quot; in 1991. CRISTA-SPAS is a joint U.S./German experiment.

Other payloads in &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27;s cargo bay included the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV-7) payload and the Experiment on the Sun Complementing ATLAS (ESCAPE-II). Payloads located in the middeck include the Physiological &amp; Anatomical Rodent Experiment (PARE/NIR-R), Protein Crystal Growth-Thermal Enclosure (PCG-TES), Protein Crystal Growth- Single Locker (PCG-STES), Space Tissue Loss/National Institute of Health (STL/NIH-C), Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS) and the Heat Pipe Performance-2 Experiment (HPP-2).
STS-66 further advanced comprehensive effort to collect data about sun&#x27;s energy output, chemical makeup of the Earth&#x27;s middle atmosphere, and how these factors affect global ozone levels. Seven instruments on the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science-3 (ATLAS-3) also flew on first two ATLAS flights. No other collection of space-based instruments provides the same extensive range of atmospheric measurements. Also considered a primary payload was the Cryogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere-Shuttle Pallet Satellite (CRISTA-SPAS), continuing joint NASA-German Space Agency (DARA, now the DLR) series of scientific missions. ATLAS-3 and CRISTA-SPAS considered as joint mission with single set of science objectives. During the mission the crew divided into two teams for around-the-clock research.

ATLAS-3 instruments, mounted on a Spacelab pallet in the cargo bay, included Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS), which collected more data on trace gases in the atmosphere than on all three of its previous flights combined; Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Spectrometer (SSBUV), which took ozone measurements to calibrate ozone monitor on aging NOAA-9 satellite as well as cooperative measurements with other ATLAS-3 instruments; Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM), which took extremely precise measurements of the sun&#x27;s total radiation for 30 orbits as calibration reference for sister instrument on Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) launched in 1991; Measurement of the Solar Constant (SOLCON), provided by Belgium, which also measured solar radiation but as reference point to track changes over years; Solar Spectrum Measurement (SOLSPEC), French instrument, measured the Sun&#x27;s radiation as function of wavelength; and Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM), which collected its highest precision solar ultraviolet radiation measurements in its 15-year lifetime. Millimeter Wave Atmospheric Sounder (MAS), collected nine hours of observations, measuring distribution of water vapor, chlorine monoxide and ozone at altitudes between 12 and 60 miles (20 to ), before computer malfunction halted instrument operations.
CRISTA-SPAS released from orbiter&#x27;s Remote Manipulator System arm on second day of mission. Flying at distance of about 25 to 44 miles (40 to ) behind the Shuttle, payload collected data for more than eight days before being retrieved and returned to the cargo bay. The CRISTA instrument gathered first global information about medium and small scale disturbances in trace gases in middle atmosphere, which could lead to better models of the atmosphere and Earth&#x27;s energy balance. The second CRISTA-SPAS instrument, the Middle Atmosphere High Resolution Spectrograph Investigation (MAHRSI) measured amounts of ozone-destroying hydroxyl and nitric oxide in the middle atmosphere and lower thermosphere from 24 to 72 miles (40 to ). MAHRSI yielded first complete global maps of hydroxyl in atmosphere.

For retrieval of CRISTA-SPAS, a different approach method to the spacecraft was successfully tested as a prelude to the upcoming U.S. Shuttle/Russian Space Station Mir docking flights. Called R-Bar approach, it is expected to save propellant while reducing risk of contamination to Mir systems from orbiter thruster jet firings. STS-66 was the last solo shuttle flight for &quot;Atlantis&quot; for over 14 years, as her upcoming missions were dedicated to Mir, and ISS flights. &quot;Atlantis&quot; would not fly solo again until STS-125 (The final Hubble Space Telescope Mission).

<text>Pipistrellus is a genus of bats in the family Vespertilionidae and subfamily Vespertilioninae. The name of the genus is derived from the Italian word , meaning &quot;bat&quot; (from Latin &quot;bird of evening, bat&quot;).

The size of the genus has been considerably reduced as a result of work during the 1990s and 2000s, with genera such as &quot;Arielulus&quot;, &quot;Hypsugo&quot;, &quot;Falsistrellus&quot;, &quot;Neoromicia&quot;, &quot;Parastrellus&quot;, &quot;Perimyotis&quot;, &quot;Scotozous&quot;, and &quot;Vespadelus&quot; being split off. Still, molecular evidence suggests the genus is not monophyletic. Several other genera in the subfamily Vespertilioninae have also been merged with &quot;Pipistrellus&quot; in previous classifications. Species in the genus may be referred to as &quot;pipistrelles&quot; or &quot;pipistrelle bats&quot;, though these terms are also used for species now placed in other genera, such as the western pipistrelle (&quot;Parastrellus hesperus&quot;) and eastern pipistrelle (&quot;Perimyotis subflavus&quot;) of North America. Species of the Southern Hemisphere separated to genus &quot;Falsistrellus&quot; are sometimes referred to as false pipistrelle or falsistrelle.

They are somewhat distinguished from their much larger relatives, the noctule bats &quot;Nyctalus&quot; by their weak, fluttery flight reminiscent of a butterfly, though a few species are more direct in their flight.

<text>The Project 941 &quot;Akula&quot; (, meaning &#x27;shark&#x27;, NATO reporting name Typhoon), was a class of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines designed and built by the Soviet Union for the Soviet Navy. With a submerged displacement of , the Typhoons were the largest submarines ever built, able to accommodate comfortable living facilities for the crew of 160 when submerged for several months. The source of the NATO reporting name remains unclear, although it is often claimed to be related to the use of the word &quot;typhoon&quot; (&quot;тайфун&quot;) by General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev of the Communist Party in a 1974 speech while describing a new type of nuclear ballistic missile submarine, as a reaction to the United States Navy&#x27;s new .

The Russian Navy cancelled its modernization program in March 2012, stating that modernizing one Typhoon would be as expensive as building two new s. A total of six boats of the Typhoon class had been built and a seventh was started but never finished. Three boats were decommissioned in the 1990s and were scrapped in the 2000s, another two were decommissioned during the 2000s and are currently inactive. With the announcement that Russia has eliminated the last R-39 Rif (SS-N-20 &quot;Sturgeon&quot;) submarine-launched ballistic missiles in September 2012, only one Typhoon remained in service, , which was refitted with the more modern RSM-56 Bulava SLBM for testing. She continued to serve until February 2023, when she was decommissioned. 

==Description==

Soviet – subsequently Russian – nuclear submarines are identified by the letter &quot;K&quot; followed by a number (for example, the lead boat of the , the , is K-560). K stands for Cruiser: (&quot;Крейсер&quot;). The sheer displacement of the Typhoon-class boats, comparable to several aircraft carrier classes, led to their classification as Heavy Cruisers (&quot;Тяжелый Крейсер&quot;).

Besides their missile armament, the Typhoon class featured six torpedo tubes designed to handle RPK-2 (SS-N-15) missiles or Type 53 torpedoes. A Typhoon-class submarine could stay submerged for 120 days in normal conditions, and potentially more if deemed necessary (e.g., in the case of a nuclear war). Their primary weapons system was composed of 20 R-39 (NATO: SS-N-20) submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) with a maximum of ten multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle nuclear warheads each. Technically, Typhoons were able to deploy their long-range nuclear missiles while moored at their docks.

Typhoon-class submarines featured multiple pressure hulls which simplifies internal design while making the vessel much wider than a normal submarine. In the main body of the sub, two long pressure hulls lie parallel with a third, smaller pressure hull above them (which protrudes just below the sail), and two other pressure hulls for torpedoes and steering gear. This also greatly increases their survivability – even if one pressure hull is breached, the crew members in the other are safe and there is less potential for flooding. Its ballistic missiles were placed between the two main pressure hulls, their launch tubes enclosed only by the outer, &quot;light&quot; hull.

The Typhoon was capable of traveling at submerged.

==History==

The Typhoon class was developed under Project 941 as the Soviet &quot;Akula&quot; class (&quot;Акула&quot;), meaning shark. It is sometimes confused with other submarines, as Akula is the name NATO uses to designate the Russian Project 971 &quot;Shchuka-B&quot; (&quot;Щука-Б&quot;)-class attack submarines. The project was developed with the objective to match the SLBM armament of s, capable of carrying 192 nuclear warheads, 100 kt each, but with significantly longer range. To accommodate this increase in range, Soviet SLBMs were substantially larger and heavier than their American adversaries (the R-39s is more than twice as heavy as the UGM-96 Trident I; it remains the heaviest SLBM to have been in service worldwide). The submarine had to be scaled accordingly.

In the early 1990s, there were also proposals to refit some of the Typhoon-class submarines to submarine cargo vessels for shipping oil, gas and cargo under polar ice to Russia&#x27;s far flung northern territories. The submarines could take up to of cargo on-board and ship it under the polar ice to tankers waiting in the Barents Sea. These ships – after the considerable engineering required to develop technologies to transfer oil from drilling platforms to the submarines, and later, to the waiting tankers – would then deliver their cargo world-wide.

Six Typhoon-class submarines were built between 1976 and 1985. Originally, the submarines were designated by hull numbers only. Names were later assigned to the four vessels retained by the Russian Navy after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. During the time of the Russian Federation, these boats were to be sponsored by either a city or company. The construction order for an additional vessel (hull number TK-210) was cancelled and never completed. 

In late December 2008, a senior Navy official announced that the two Typhoon-class submarines, &quot;Arkhangelsk&quot; and &quot;Severstal&quot;, that were in reserve would not be rearmed with the new Bulava SLBM missile system. They could potentially yet be modified to carry cruise missiles or to lay mines, or could be used in special operations. In late June 2009, the Navy Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Vladimir Vysotskiy, told reporters that the two submarines would be reserved for possible future repairs and modernisation. In September 2011, the Russian defense ministry decided to write off all Project 941 &quot;Akula&quot; nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines until 2014. The reasons for decommissioning the Typhoon-class vessels are the restrictions imposed on Russia by the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and successful trials of the new .

Despite being a replacement for many types of submarines, the Borei-class submarines are slightly shorter than the Typhoon class ( as opposed to ), and have a smaller crew (107 people as opposed to 160). These changes were in part designed to reduce the cost to build and maintain the submarines. In addition, the United States and Canada provided 80% of funds for scrapping the older Typhoon-class submarines, making it much more economical to build a new submarine.

TK-13, which was scrapped in 2007–2009.

On 20 July 2022, it was reported that was withdrawn from the Russian Navy. This was an earlier-than-expected decommission date, as it was stated in 2021 that the submarine was expected to remain in service until 2026 as a weapons test platform. However, sources suggested in 2022 that the 2026 date was not in the Russian Navy plan.
On 6 February 2023, it was reported she was decommissioned.

<text>STS-63 was the second mission of the US/Russian Shuttle-Mir Program and the 20th flight of Discovery, which carried out the first rendezvous of the American Space Shuttle with Russia&#x27;s space station &quot;Mir&quot;. Known as the &#x27;Near-Mir&#x27; mission, the flight used Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;, which lifted off from launch pad 39B on February 3, 1995, from Kennedy Space Center, Florida. A night launch and the 20th mission for &quot;Discovery&quot;, it marked the first time a Space Shuttle mission had a female pilot, Eileen Collins, and the first EVAs for both a UK born astronaut, Michael Foale, and a US astronaut of African heritage, Bernard A. Harris, Jr. It also carried out the successful deployment and retrieval of the Spartan-204 platform, along with the scheduled rendezvous and flyaround of &quot;Mir&quot;, in preparation for STS-71, the first mission to dock with &quot;Mir&quot;.

===Spacewalks===
* Foale and Harris – EVA 1
*EVA 1 Start: February 9, 1995 – 11:56 UTC
*EVA 1 End: February 9, 1995 – 16:35 UTC
*Duration: 4 hours, 39 minutes

=== Crew seat assignments ===

==Mission highlights==
STS-63&#x27;s primary objective was to perform a rendezvous and fly around the Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot;. The objectives of the &quot;Mir&quot; rendezvous were to verify flight techniques, communications and navigation aid sensor interfaces, and engineering analyses associated with Shuttle/&quot;Mir&quot; proximity operations in preparation for the STS-71 docking mission.

Other objectives of the flight were to perform the operations necessary to fulfill the requirements of experiments located in SPACEHAB-3 and to fly captively, then deploy and retrieve the Spartan-204 payload. Spartan-204, the Shuttle Pointed Autonomous Research Tool for Astronomy, was a free-flying retrievable platform. It was designed to obtain data in the far ultraviolet region of the spectrum from diffuse sources of light. Two crewmembers were scheduled to perform a five-hour spacewalk.

Payloads flying aboard STS-63 included the Cryo Systems Experiment (CSE), the Shuttle Glow (GLO-2) experiment, Orbital Debris Radar Calibration Spheres (ODERACS-2), the Solid Surface Combustion Experiment (SSCE), the Air Force Maui Optical Site Calibration Test (AMOS) and the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX).

Beginning on flight day one, a series of thruster burns were performed daily to bring &quot;Discovery&quot; in line with &quot;Mir&quot;. The original plan called for the orbiter to approach to no closer than 10 meters (33 ft) from &quot;Mir&quot;, and then complete a flyaround of the Russian space station. However, three of the 44 orbiter Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters—small firing jets used for on-orbit maneuvering—sprang leaks prior to rendezvous. Shortly after main engine cutoff, two leaks occurred in the aft primary thrusters, one of which—called R1U—was key to rendezvous. A third leak occurred later in flight in the forward primary thruster, but the crew was able to fix the problem.

After extensive negotiations and technical information exchanges between the U.S. and Russian space teams, the Russians concluded close approach could be safely achieved and the STS-63 crew was given &#x27;go&#x27; to proceed. R1U&#x27;s thruster manifold was closed and the backup thruster was selected for the approach. Ship-to-ship radio contact with &quot;Mir&quot; was achieved well ahead of time, and Titov, who had previously lived on &quot;Mir&quot; for more than a year, communicated excitedly with the three cosmonauts aboard the space station: Mir 17 Commander Alexander Viktorenko; Flight Engineer Yelena Kondakova; and Valery Polyakov, a physician who had broken Titov&#x27;s record for extended time in space. After stationkeeping at a distance of from &quot;Mir&quot; and with Wetherbee manually controlling the orbiter, &quot;Discovery&quot; was flown to from the Russian space station. &quot;As we are bringing our spaceships closer together, we are bringing our nations closer together,&quot; Wetherbee said after &quot;Discovery&quot; was at point of closest approach. &quot;The next time we approach, we will shake your hand and together we will lead our world into the next millennium.&quot; The closest approach to &quot;Mir&quot; of occurred on February 6, 1995, at 19:23:20 UTC.
&quot;We are one. We are human,&quot; Viktorenko responded. Wetherbee then backed the orbiter away to and performed a one and a quarter-loop flyaround of &quot;Mir&quot; while the station was filmed and photographed. The &quot;Mir&quot; crew reported no vibrations or solar array movement as result of the approach.

The crew also worked extensively with payloads aboard &quot;Discovery&quot;. Flying in the forward payload bay and activated on flight day one was SPACEHAB-3. The commercially developed module was making its third flight on the Shuttle and carried 20 experiments: 11 biotechnology experiments, three advanced materials development experiments, four technology demonstrations and two pieces of supporting hardware measuring on-orbit accelerations. Improvements had been made to the SPACEHAB system to reduce demand on crew time. A new video switch had been added to lessen the need for astronaut involvement in video operations, and an experiment interface had been added to the telemetry system to allow the experiment investigator to link directly via computer with the onboard experiment to receive data and monitor status. Charlotte, an experimental robotic device being flown for the first time, also reduced crew workload by taking over simple tasks such as changing experiment samples.

Among the plant growth experiments was Astroculture, flying for the fourth time on the Shuttle. The objective of Astroculture was to validate performance of plant growth technologies in the microgravity environment of space for application to a life support system in space. The investigation had applications on Earth, since it covered such topics as energy-efficient lighting and removal of pollutants from indoor air. One of the pharmaceutical experiments, Immune, also had Earth applications. Exploiting a known tendency of spaceflight to weaken the immune system, the Immune experiment tested the ability of a particular substance to prevent or reduce this weakening. Clinical applications could include treatment of individuals suffering from such immunosuppressant diseases as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

On flight day two, the crew deployed the Orbital Debris Radar Calibration System-II (ODERACS-II) to help characterize the orbital debris environment for objects smaller than 10 centimeters (about four inches) in diameter. A complement of six target objects of known dimensions and with limited orbital lifespans was released into orbit and tracked by ground-based radars, allowing precise calibration of radars so they can more accurately track smaller pieces of space debris in low Earth orbit.

Also on flight day two, the crew lifted with the orbiter remote manipulator system arm SPARTAN-204 from its support structure in payload bay. SPARTAN remained suspended on the arm for observation of orbiter glow phenomenon and thruster jet firings. SPARTAN-204 was later released from the arm to complete about 40 hours of free-flight, during which time its Far Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph instrument studied celestial targets in the interstellar medium, the gas and dust which fills the space between the stars and which is the material from which new stars and planets are formed.

SPARTAN-204 was also used for extravehicular activity (EVA) near end of the flight. Foale and Harris began their EVA suspended at the end of the robot arm, away from the payload bay, to test modifications to their spacesuits to keep spacewalkers warmer in the extreme cold of space. The two astronauts were then scheduled to practice handling the approximately 2,500 pound () SPARTAN to rehearse space station assembly techniques, but both astronauts reported they were becoming very cold—this portion of the spacewalk being performed during a night pass—and mass handling was curtailed. This 29th Shuttle spacewalk, the first for both a UK-born astronaut and an African-American astronaut, lasted 4 hours, 38 minutes.

Other payloads: Along with ODERACS-II, the Cryo System Experiment (CSE) and Shuttle Glow (GLO-2) payloads were mounted on the Hitchhiker support assembly in cargo bay; an IMAX camera was also located here. In middeck, the Solid Surface Combustion Experiment (SSCE) flew for the eighth time. The Air Force Maui Optical Site (AMOS) test required no onboard hardware.
== Coca-Cola in Space ==
BioServe Space Technologies at the University of Colorado, Boulder, developed the Fluids Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus-1 (FGBA-1) in cooperation with Coca-Cola and several other groups. It dispensed pre-mixed soda for astronauts&#x27; consumption and studied their changed taste perceptions. Astronauts rated control samples before and after flight. FGBA-2 flew on STS-77.

==Mission highlights==
=== Ultraviolet Imaging Experiments ===

Astro-2 was the second dedicated Spacelab mission to conduct astronomical observations in the ultraviolet spectral regions (the first was the Astro-1 mission flown on STS-35). The Astro-2 Spacelab consisted of three unique instruments – the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT), the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT) and the Wisconsin Ultraviolet Photo-Polarimeter Experiment (WUPPE). These took measurements from objects within the Solar System as well as individual stars, nebulae, supernova remnants, galaxies and active extragalactic objects. The data supplemented the data obtained from the Astro-1 mission.

The purpose of the UIT was to observe UV radiation from space (most UV radiation is absorbed by Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and cannot be studied from the ground). The data collected from UIT Astro-1 mission provided the first accurate knowledge of UV data from the universe. The UIT in the Astro-2 Spacelab was capable of capturing almost twice the UV spectrum of its predecessor. As STS-67 launched at a different time of year from STS-35, data was collected from portions of the sky that Astro-1 was not able to view.

=== Middeck Active Control Experiment (MACE) ===

On the Middeck, science experiments included the Protein Crystal Growth Thermal Enclosure System Vapor Diffusion Apparatus-03 experiment (PCG-TES-03), the Protein Crystal Growth Single Thermal Enclosure System-02 (PCG-STES-02), the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment-II (SAREX-II), the Middeck Active Control Experiment (MACE), the Commercial Materials Dispersion Apparatus Instrumentation Technology Associates Experiments-03 (CMIX-03) and the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX).

The Middeck Active Control Experiment (MACE) was a space engineering research payload and activity. It consisted of a rate gyro, reaction wheels, a precision pointing payload, and a scanning and pointing payload that produces motion disturbances. The goal of the experiment was to test a closed loop control system that could compensate for motion disturbances. On orbit, Commander Stephen S. Oswald and Pilot William G. Gregory used MACE to test about 200 different motion disturbance situations over 45 hours of testing during the mission. Information from MACE was to be used to design better control systems that compensate for motion in future spacecraft.

== Getaway Special Payloads ==

Two Get Away Special (GAS) payloads were also on board. They were the G-387 and G-388 canisters. This experiment was sponsored by the Australian Space Office and AUSPACE ltd. The objectives were to make ultraviolet observations of deep space or nearby galaxies. These observations were made to study the structure of galactic supernova remnants, the distribution of hot gas in the Magellanic Clouds, the hot galactic halo emission, and emission associated with galactic cooling flows and jets. The two GAS canisters were interconnected with a cable. Canister 1 had a motorized door assembly that exposed a UV telescope to space when opened. UV reflective filters on the telescopes optics determine its UV bandpass. Canister 2 contained two video recorders for data storage and batteries to provide experiment power. It was Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s longest flight.

==Mission insignia==
The spiral galaxy, Jupiter, and the four moons (total of six space objects) as well as the seven stars of the insignia symbolize the flight&#x27;s numerical designation in the Space Transportation System&#x27;s mission sequence. &quot;Endeavour&quot;, with ASTRO-2, is speeding by.

She starred in the film &quot;An American Tragedy&quot; (1931). She is also known for starring in the 1943 Val Lewton psychological horror film &quot;I Walked With a Zombie&quot;. 
==Early life==
The younger daughter of Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Marion Dee and his wife, the former Henriette Putnam, Frances Marion Dee was born in Los Angeles, California, where her father worked as a civil service examiner.

When Dee was seven years old, her family moved to Chicago, Illinois. She attended Shakespeare Grammar School and Hyde Park High School, where she went by the nickname of Frankie Dee. 

After graduating from Hyde Park High in 1927, of which she was vice president of her senior class, as well as voted Belle of the Year, she spent two years at the University of Chicago, where she participated in dramatic activities, then returned to California.

==Career==

Following her sophomore year in 1929, she went on summer vacation with her mother and older sister to visit family in the Los Angeles area. She began working as a movie extra as a lark. Her big break came when she was still an extra; she was offered the lead opposite Maurice Chevalier in &quot;Playboy of Paris&quot;.

The audience appeal established in two films opposite Paramount stars Charles &quot;Buddy&quot; Rogers and Richard Arlen led to the co-starring role of Sondra Finchley, opposite Phillips Holmes and Sylvia Sidney, in Paramount Pictures&#x27;s prestigious and controversial production of &quot;An American Tragedy&quot;, directed by Josef von Sternberg.

Dee&#x27;s additional screen credits included &quot;June Moon&quot;, &quot;Little Women&quot;, &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot;, &quot;Becky Sharp&quot;, and &quot;Payment on Demand&quot;. She co-starred with her husband Joel McCrea in the Western &quot;Four Faces West&quot; (1948).

==Personal life==
Dee met actor Joel McCrea on the set of the 1933 film &quot;The Silver Cord&quot;. The couple married on October 20, 1933, after a whirlwind courtship, and remained married until McCrea&#x27;s death in 1990. During their lifetime together, the McCreas lived, raised their children, and rode their horses on their ranch in what was then an unincorporated area of eastern Ventura County, California. They ultimately donated several hundred acres of their personal property to the newly formed Conejo Valley YMCA for the city of Thousand Oaks, California. Dee, like McCrea, was a Republican. Joel McCrea died on their 57th wedding anniversary. 

Dee was honored at the 1998 Memphis Film Festival in Tennessee. In 2004, Frances Dee McCrea died in Norwalk, Connecticut due to complications from a stroke at the age of 94.

<text>Blue&#x27;s Clues is an American interactive educational children&#x27;s television series created by Traci Paige Johnson, Todd Kessler, and Angela C. Santomero. It premiered on Nickelodeon&#x27;s Nick Jr. block on September 8, 1996, and concluded its run on August 6, 2006, with a total of six seasons and 143 episodes. The original host of the show was Steve Burns, who left in 2002 and was replaced by Donovan Patton (as &quot;Joe&quot;) for the fifth and sixth seasons. The show follows an animated blue-spotted dog named Blue as she leaves a trail of clues/paw prints for the host and the viewers to figure out her plans for the day.

The producers and creators combined concepts from child development and early-childhood education with innovative animation and production techniques that helped their viewers learn, using research conducted thirty years since the debut of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in the U.S. Unlike earlier preschool shows, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; presented material in a narrative format instead of a magazine format, used repetition to reinforce its curriculum, structured every episode the same way, and revolutionized the genre by inviting their viewers&#x27; involvement.

Research was part of the creative and decision-making process in the production of the show, and was integrated into all aspects and stages of the creative process. &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; was the first cutout animation series for preschoolers in the United States and resembles a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple construction paper shapes of familiar objects with varied colors and textures. Its home-based setting is familiar to American children, but has a look unlike previous children&#x27;s TV shows.

Upon debuting, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; received critical acclaim. It became the highest-rated show for preschoolers on American commercial television, and was significant to Nickelodeon&#x27;s growth. The show has been syndicated in 120 countries and translated into 15 languages. Regional versions of the show featuring local hosts have been produced in other countries. By 2002, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; had received several awards for excellence in children&#x27;s programming, educational software and licensing, and had been nominated for nine Emmy Awards.

A live production of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, which used many of the production innovations developed by the show&#x27;s creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999. As of 2002, over two million people had attended over 1,000 performances. A spin-off called &quot;Blue&#x27;s Room&quot; premiered in 2004. A revival of the series titled &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues &amp; You!&quot;, hosted by Josh Dela Cruz premiered on Nickelodeon on November 11, 2019. The show&#x27;s extensive use of research in its development and production process inspired several research studies that have provided evidence for its effectiveness as a learning tool.

== History ==
=== Background ===
By 1990, parents, teachers and media experts had been criticizing &quot;the lack of quality fare for children on commercial television&quot; for many years. Up to that point, PBS was the only source for quality children&#x27;s television; other broadcasters voluntarily set educational standards for their programming and &quot;were expected to regulate themselves&quot;, but it led to little change in the quality of children&#x27;s programs. By the time &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; premiered in 1996, there was a large number of TV shows for children, but most of them were violent and designed to sell action toys and other products; as co-creator Angela C. Santomero put it, &quot;a vehicle for toy-based &#x27;commercials&#x27;&quot;. According to author Diane Tracy in her 2002 book &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues for Success&quot;, &quot;The state of children&#x27;s television was pretty dismal&quot;.

There was little incentive for producing high-quality children&#x27;s television until 1990, when Congress passed the Children&#x27;s Television Act (CTA), which &quot;required that networks be held accountable for the quality of children&#x27;s programming or risk losing their license&quot;. The CTA set no hourly quotas and left it to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to determine compliance to the law, so little positive improvements were made. In 1996, the FCC passed additional regulations, including requiring broadcasters to, in a provision called &quot;the Three-Hour rule&quot;, air at least three hours of children&#x27;s programming per week, between the hours of 07:00 to 22:00, and that they be tagged with an E/I (Educational and Informational) logo so that children and their families could easily find the programs. The cable network Nickelodeon, which was recognized, along with PBS, as a leader in the creation and production of high-quality children&#x27;s programming, was not required to comply with federal regulations to provide informative or educational content, but did so anyway, before the CTA became law.

According to Heather L. Kirkorian and her fellow researchers Ellen Wartella and Daniel Anderson in 2008, since television appeared in homes beginning in the mid-20th century, critics have often expressed concern about its impact on viewers, especially children, who as Kirkorian argued, are &quot;active media users&quot; by the age of three. Researchers believed that there were links between television viewing and children&#x27;s cognitive and learning skills and that what children watched may be more important than how much they watched it. She reported that up until the 1980s, researchers had only an implicit theory about how viewers watched television, and that young children were cognitively passive viewers and controlled by &quot;salient attention-eliciting features&quot; like sound effects and fast movement. As a result, most researchers believed that television interfered with cognition and reflection and as a result, children could not learn from and process television. In the early 1980s, however, new theories about how young children watch television suggested that attention in children as young as two-years old were largely guided by program content.

=== Conception ===
In the mid-1990s, Nickelodeon, looking to create programming for preschoolers, hired a team of three producers, Angela C. Santomero, Todd Kessler, and Traci Paige Johnson, to create a new television program for young children. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Kessler was the first creator to be brought on board to the project. Kessler, a freelance Nickelodeon producer at the time, had previously worked on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, but he disliked its format and thought that it was too static and not visual enough. Santomero, who named Fred Rogers as a major influence, worked at Nickelodeon as a researcher and Johnson was a freelance artist and animator. Santomero later said that they &quot;were young, and Nickelodeon took a chance on us&quot;.

Daniel R. Anderson of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who author Malcolm Gladwell called one of the &quot;pioneering television researchers&quot;, was an adviser for the new show. Nickelodeon had hired Anderson as an adviser for its Nick Jr. block of preschool programs starting in 1993, although Santomero had already been getting his input about research informally. When Nickelodeon enlisted her to co-create &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, he came on in a more formal capacity. Anderson later said that he &quot;jumped at the chance&quot; to serve as an advisor for Blue&#x27;s Clues because &quot;Nickelodeon was interested in providing programs that would actually benefit preschoolers rather than merely entertain them&quot;. Anderson also stated that the choice to produce the show as overtly and clearly educational was a departure for Nickelodeon and for any commercial network. According to research conducted by Nickelodeon, parents of preschool aged children wanted the shows they watched to be educational.

Santomero, Kessler, and Johnson met in a conference room at Viacom, which owned Nickelodeon, in New York for a month to create &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;. According to Santomero, the creators of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; wanted to create a children&#x27;s television show that was &quot;something very simple and graphic and slow&quot;, emphasized social and emotional skills, treated children like they were smart, and helped them feel empowered. The character Blue was originally conceived as a cat, and the name of the show was to be &quot;Blue Prints&quot;, but the show&#x27;s name was changed and Blue became a dog because Nickelodeon was already producing a show about a cat and because, as Anderson reported, children who watched the pilot, which was used for testing, &quot;almost universally called the show &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;&quot;. Even though most children&#x27;s television shows at the time were built around male characters, Blue was female and as &quot;The New York Times&quot; put it, &quot;never wore a bow&quot;.

Kessler handled the show&#x27;s &quot;computer-based production&quot;, Santomero the research, and Johnson the design. By 2001, the show&#x27;s research team, which worked collaboratively with the show&#x27;s producers and creators, consisted of director of research Alice Wilder, who joined the &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; team shortly after the show&#x27;s debut, Alison Sherman, Karen Leavitt, and Koshi Dhingra. They were given $150,000 to produce a pilot, about a quarter of the budget for other Nickelodeon shows at the time, which was used in 1995 to test the show&#x27;s interactive elements with its potential audience. The pilot was considered lost, but in 2021, Santomero announced that she owned a copy of it, and that the pilot was filmed in 1994. In September 2023, the full pilot unexpectedly surfaced online, putting an end to the nearly two-decade long search for it.

=== Premiere and later history ===
&quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; premiered in the United States on September 8, 1996. The premiere was the highest-rated premiere of any Nickelodeon program, and the show became crucial to the network&#x27;s growth. Scholar Norma Pecora called &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; the &quot;cornerstone&quot; of Nickelodeon&#x27;s educational programming. By the end of 1997, it was the highest-rated show for preschoolers on commercial television, and was the third-highest rated show behind children&#x27;s public television shows; &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot; and &quot;Arthur&quot;. Within 18 months of its premiere, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; was as well known among the parents of preschoolers as more established children&#x27;s shows such as &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot;. In 2002, Tracy reported that it was one of the highest-rated shows for preschoolers, was preschool children and their parents&#x27; favorite cable preschool program, was viewed by approximately 13.7 million viewers each week, and aired in about 60 countries.

In 2000, after 75 episodes, with &quot;no fanfare&quot; and no announcement from Nickelodeon, co-creator and co-producer Todd Kessler left &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; and the network to pursue other projects. He told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he had &quot;no hard feelings&quot; regarding his departure. Kessler continued to be listed as an executive producer for the run of the show and for any future spin-offs. Also in 2000, CBS, which was also owned by Viacom, began airing the show as part of the centerpiece of its Saturday and Sunday morning children&#x27;s programming. In 2004, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; stopped production, which Santomero called &quot;devastating&quot;, although it continued to air on Nickelodeon, and a spin-off, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Room&quot;, was launched in the same year. It featured puppets, as well as the original show&#x27;s second host. &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; celebrated its 10-year anniversary in 2006 with a prime time special and the release of a DVD entitled &quot;Blue&#x27;s Biggest Stories&quot;, which consisted of eight half-hour episodes spanning the show&#x27;s history.

In November 2019, a reboot of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; premiered. The show, called &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues &amp; You!&quot;, is hosted by Josh Dela Cruz and features many of the same characters in the original show. Steve Burns, the original show&#x27;s first host, serves as a writer and director on the new show; he has also made guest appearances, along with the original show&#x27;s second host Donovan Patton, and participated in the casting of Dela Cruz.

=== Casting ===


The most important casting decision was that of the host, the only human character in the show. The host&#x27;s role was to empower and challenge the show&#x27;s young viewers, to help increase their self-esteem, and to strongly connect with them through the television screen. The producers originally wanted a female host. After months of research and over 1,000 auditions, they hired actor/performer Steve Burns based on the strength of his audition. Burns received the strongest and most enthusiastic response in tests with the young audience. Johnson said what made Burns a great children&#x27;s TV host was that &quot;he didn&#x27;t want to be a children&#x27;s host ... He loved kids, but he didn&#x27;t want to make a career out of it&quot;. Burns decided to leave the show in the autumn of 2000, departing in January 2001. He was in over 100 episodes of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; when his final episodes aired in April 2002. Burns himself stated, &quot;I knew I wasn&#x27;t gonna be doing children&#x27;s television all my life, mostly because I refused to lose my hair on a kid&#x27;s TV show, and it was happenin&#x27; – fast.&quot;

After the producers conducted 1,500 auditions, Burns was replaced by actor Donovan Patton, who played Steve&#x27;s brother Joe, introduced to the audience in articles in Nickelodeon&#x27;s magazine and on its webpage and an arc of three episodes. Burns&#x27; departure generated &quot;outlandish rumors&quot; and was featured in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine story. Patton had never seen &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; before he auditioned for the part, and like Burns, who worked with him to help him prepare for the role, was also popular with preschool test audiences. The producers later reported that finding someone who could match Burns&#x27; &quot;deceptively simple performance&quot; was difficult. Patton became a &quot;household name&quot;, although as Johnson stated, his character was named Joe because &quot;Donovan was a little too hard on a preschooler&#x27;s tongue&quot;. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Patton played the role more relaxed and &quot;taller&quot; than Burns.

Even though research demonstrated that children tend to pay less attention to adult male voices, Burns and Patton were chosen as the program&#x27;s hosts because they were popular with their audience. Daniel Anderson insisted that Burns and Patton were the best actors for their roles out of the hundreds who auditioned, calling them &quot;actors who could mime as demanded by the mixed action and animation format&quot;, and reported that there was no evidence that children paid less attention to them than to other parts of the program. He also said that Burns and Patton overcame what he called &quot;attentional bias against men&quot; in three ways: by behaving energetically and childlike; by breaking the fourth wall and talking directly to the audience, often by looking directly into the camera and asking their audience, &quot;Will you help?&quot;, and like Fred Rogers, forming a direct relationship to the audience; and by &quot;always doing something&quot;. Anderson insisted that by forming a relationship with the audience, the actors&#x27; male voice became cues to the audience to pay attention and stated that it was the hosts&#x27; style of presentation that determined child attention.

Johnson was cast as Blue&#x27;s voice because, of the show&#x27;s crew, she was able to sound the most like a dog. Nick Balaban, who wrote the music for the show along with Michael Rubin, was cast as the voice of Mr. Salt. Balaban initially used a Brooklyn accent for Mr. Salt before settling on a French accent. Rubin also provided the voice of Mailbox.

== Format ==
In &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;, author Malcolm Gladwell, who called &quot;Blues Clues&quot; the &quot;&#x27;stickiest&#x27;—meaning the most irresistible and involving—television show ever&quot;, described its format:
Steve, the host, presents the audience with a puzzle involving Blue, the animated dog ... To help the audience unlock the puzzle, Blue leaves behind a series of clues, which are objects marked with one of her paw prints. In between the discovery of the clues, Steve plays a series of games—mini-puzzles—with the audience that are thematically related to the overall puzzle ... As the show unfolds, Steve and Blue move from one animated set to another, jumping through magical doorways, leading viewers on a journey of discovery, until, at the end of the story, Steve returns to the living room. There, at the climax of the show, he sits down in a comfortable chair to think—a chair known, of course, in the literal world of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, as the Thinking Chair. He puzzles over Blue&#x27;s three clues and attempts to come up with the answer.
Nickelodeon researcher Daniel R. Anderson called the structure of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; a game that presented its viewers with increasingly challenging and developmentally appropriate problems to solve. Early episodes focused on basic subjects such as colors and numbers, but later the programs focused on math, physics, anatomy, and astronomy. The show&#x27;s producers believed that comprehension and attention were strongly connected, so they wrote the episodes to encourage and increase their viewers&#x27; attention. They used content and production characteristics such as pacing which gave children time to respond, as well as &quot;camera techniques, children&#x27;s voices, musical cues, sound effects, clear transitions, repeatable dialogue, and visuals&quot;. Participation, in the form of spoken or physical response from the audience, and the mastery of thinking skills were encouraged by the use of repetition, both within the structure of individual episodes and across multiple episodes. The producers used a variety of formal features, which were auditory, and content features, which consisted of invitations given to the audience. The features were also in the form of both recurrent and unique formats and content. The purpose of the recurrent formats and content, which were similar in every episode, was to increase viewers&#x27; attention, comprehension, and participation during key educational lessons.

Nickelodeon originally aired the same episode daily for five days before showing the next one. The producers believed this telecast strategy empowered young children by giving them many opportunities to master the content and problems presented to them. Scholar Norma Pecora considered the broadcast strategy of airing the same episode for five consecutive days in a week &quot;sound educational thinking&quot;, because children tend to watch the same episodes multiple times and learn from repetition, and &quot;economically clever&quot; because the network could air 2.5 hours with one episode over five days.

== Educational goals ==
The creators and producers&#x27; mission of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; was to &quot;empower, challenge, and build the self-esteem of preschoolers ... while making them laugh&quot;. According to Anderson and his colleagues, the show&#x27;s curriculum was based on &quot;inherent respect for preschoolers and their ability to think and learn while having fun&quot;. Anderson and his colleagues stated that &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; was created with the question: What does television teach young children? Kessler, Santomero, and Johnson were influenced by &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; and by &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, the first children&#x27;s television program to create a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum developed from research and use developmental theory, child development, learning theory, and research. According to Anderson, it was essential that the writers and creators of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; have background and experience in early childhood development theory and research in order to ensure that the audience understood the dialogue, game, and recurrent program elements in each episode.

Like &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, formative research was an important part of the development of each episode of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues,&quot; which was included in the show&#x27;s production budgets. &quot;We wanted to learn from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and take it one step further&quot;, Santomero said. The producers and creators used formative research, which the producers called their &quot;secret sauce&quot;, during all aspects of the program&#x27;s creative and decision-making process&quot;,&quot; and Nickelodeon provided the funding to support it. In addition to a curriculum that emphasized reasoning skills relevant to preschoolers&#x27; everyday lives, the producers wanted to include audience participation, called by &quot;Variety&quot; its &quot;call and response style&quot;, that encouraged problem solving, mastery of the information presented, positive reinforcement, and prosocial messages. They believed that a strong sense of self-esteem, which they sought to develop in their viewers, was linked to independent thinking and thinking skills. Anderson stated, &quot;Age-appropriate pacing and explicit directions give children an opportunity to have a voice&quot;. Anderson and his colleagues compared audience participation on the program with hands-on practice provided by a caregiver. The show&#x27;s producers believed, despite the viewpoints of past researchers, that children were intellectually active while watching television.

&quot;Sesame Street&quot; tested a third of its episodes, but the &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; research team field tested every episode three times with children aged between two and six in a variety of preschool environments such as Head Start programs, public schools, and private day care centers, in order to ascertain their abilities, interests, and knowledge, to ensure the mission and philosophy of the program, and to ensure balanced demographic groups. There were three phases of testing: content evaluation, video evaluations, and content analysis. In their tests of the pilot, conducted throughout the New York City area with over 100 children aged from three to seven, they found that as the pilot progressed, children&#x27;s attention was captured and sustained, and they became excited and actively participated, standing to get closer to the television and speaking to the host. The producers and researchers also consulted outside advisers, who were chosen based on their expertise and the needs of each script. As Anderson stated, the formative research team served &quot;as a liaison between the feedback provided by the preschoolers and outside advisers and the production team, including writers, talent, producers, directors, element artists, and animators&quot;.

&quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; was designed and produced on the assumption that since children are cognitively active when they watch television, a television program could be an effective method of scientific education for young children by telling stories through pictures and by modeling behavior and learning. These learning opportunities included the use of mnemonics in the form of mantras and songs, and what Tracy called &quot;metacognitive wrap-up&quot; at the end of each episode, in which the lessons were summarized and rehearsed. The producers wanted to foster their audience&#x27;s sense of empowerment by eliciting their assistance for the show&#x27;s host and by encouraging their identification with the character Blue, who served as a stand-in for the typical preschooler.

The thinking games presented in each episode used what Anderson called &quot;a layered approach&quot; that took the varying capabilities of the audience into account. Santomero said that they used scaffolding and that layering was inherent in the script and design of each game. They purposely presented the problem presented in increasing levels of difficulty, to prevent children from feeling frustrated and to master concepts, experience success, and feel empowered to attempt to solve more challenging concepts presented to them. The producers&#x27; goal was that all viewers understood the problem, even if they did not know how to solve it. As a result, the child was temporary frustrated by not knowing the answer because after giving them time to come up with it, child voice-overs provided the answers for them, so that they learned the correct answers, even if they were unable to come up with them. If the child was able to come up with the answers, however, they felt &quot;part of a larger, knowing, child audience&quot; when their answers were confirmed by the voice-overs. The child voice-overs also helped viewers maintain high levels of attention during critical educational portions of the episode and modelled the audience involvement encouraged by the program. The audience was told how they could help problem-solve by the host explaining how, by the child voice-overs modeling verbal participation, and by giving them enough time to respond. According to Johnson, the slow pace of the program was challenging for television directors used to the fast pace of television production and for parents, who praised the pace but expressed concerns that their children would find it boring.

&quot;Sesame Street&quot; reflected the prevailing view that preschoolers had short attention spans; it featured a magazine-like format consisting of varied segments. Based on research conducted over the 30 years since the launch of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; by theorists like Anderson, the producers of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; wanted to develop a show that took advantage of children&#x27;s intellectual and behavioral activity when watching television. Previous children&#x27;s television programs presented their content with little input from their viewers, but &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; was one of the first children&#x27;s shows to actively invite its viewers&#x27; involvement. Its creators believed that if children were more involved in what they were viewing, they would attend to its content longer than previously expected—for up to a half hour—and learn more. They also dropped the magazine format for a more traditional narrative format. As &quot;Variety&quot; magazine stated, &quot;The choice for &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; became to tell one story, beginning to end, camera moving left-to-right like reading a storybook, transitions from scene to scene as obvious as the turning of a page&quot;. Every episode of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; was structured in this way.

The pace of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; was deliberate, and its material was presented clearly. Similar to &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, this was done was in the use of pauses that were &quot;long enough to give the youngest time to think, short enough for the oldest not to get bored&quot;. The length of the pauses, which was estimated from formative research, gave children enough time to process the information and solve the problem. After pausing, child voice-overs provided the answers so that they were given to children who had not come up with the solution and helped encourage viewer participation. Researcher Alisha M. Crawley and her colleagues stated that although earlier programs sometimes invited overt audience participation, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; was &quot;unique in making overt involvement a systematic research-based design element&quot;. &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; also differed from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; by not using cultural references or humor aimed at adults, as this could confuse preschoolers but, instead, made the show literal, which the producers felt would better hold the children&#x27;s attention. The structure of each episode was repetitive, designed to provide preschoolers with comfort and predictability. Repetition of the same skills used in different contexts or games within and across episodes encouraged the mastery of thinking skills and the approach to content within an episode was consistent with learning theory that emphasized situated cognition and provided all viewers, no matter their age or abilities, with repeated opportunities to try to solve the problems presented.

Since preschoolers tend to have difficulty understanding transitions, especially when they involve active inferences about time, space, and characters&#x27; perspective, the program&#x27;s producers minimized transitions that required inference so that their viewers&#x27; intellectual resources could be devoted to understanding the episode&#x27;s content. They accomplished this goal by limiting the number of settings during an episode and with the transitions occurring only between them and signaled by dialogue and enough time and information necessary to process them. The primary settings in &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; were the host&#x27;s house and backyard, and transitions between them were usually done continuously, without the use of cuts. If transitions were accompanied by cuts, it was done by the host moving to and through a door and continuing as he entered the front or backyard. The biggest transition in &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; occurred when the host &quot;skidooed&quot; and jumped into a picture or book, done in a magical way with plenty of warning that it was coming, and began and ended in the new environment. Anderson reported that children clearly understood and enjoyed the skidoo transition. Santomero reported that the skidoo transition was inspired by the use of the trolley in &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, which also served as a transition device.

== Production ==
The producers and writers of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; used content and television production techniques such as camera techniques, the use of children&#x27;s voices, musical cues, sound effects, repeatable dialogue, and visuals in order to encourage and increase comprehension and attention. &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; was set in the home—the environment that was most familiar and secure for preschoolers—and looked like no other children&#x27;s television show. The theme and topic of each episode, which was in development, from idea development to final production, for approximately one year, was chosen by the research team. Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show&#x27;s curriculum and audience needs. According to show researcher Koshi Dhingra and her colleagues, the integration of writing and researching &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; was unique and involved &quot;an extremely collaborative process&quot;. Script drafts, once developed and approved by the show&#x27;s creators and research team, were tested at public and private schools, day care centers, preschools, and Head Start programs by three researchers, who would narrate the story in the form of a storybook and take notes about the children&#x27;s responses. The writers and creators revised the scripts based on this feedback. A rough video, in which the host performed from the revised script in front of a blue screen with no animation, was filmed and retested. The script was revised based on the audiences&#x27; responses, tested a third time with animation and music added, and incorporated into future productions.

According to Dhingra and her colleagues, the researchers represented the preschool viewer. After coming up with an idea for an episode, the writers met with Alice Wilder, head of the research department for &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, to discuss their idea. The research department and writers then discussed if the topic and approach to the topic was appropriate for preschoolers, and if they accepted it, the content of the episode was further developed. They would often bring in outside consultants who were experts in the subject matter and the processes in teaching it to preschoolers. Wilder considered the researchers experts in how the concepts they wanted to present would translate to the medium of television rather than in a classroom or museum, but they considered preschoolers, who evaluated each script from their perspective, to be their &quot; true experts&quot;. The writer took the information they gathered from the research department, preschoolers, and experts and wrote a treatment, or detailed outline of the script, which included goals for the entire episode and for each game. The writers, Wilder, and the research team had a treatment meeting, which Dhingra and her colleagues described as &quot;an organized creative brainstorm&quot;, which was rooted in the philosophy and mission of the show, the art of good storytelling, and the point of view of their viewers. The goal of the treatment meeting was to give the writers everything they needed to create a workable second draft of the episode script, and to ensure that it fit the needs of their viewers.

The researchers brought in experts, if needed, and then, at the second draft stage, interviewed preschoolers. Preschooler testing was conducted in three rounds: the concept test, and video test, and content analysis. The producers and creators of the show, during their interviews of preschoolers, created a rough version of the episode, with the host and preliminary animations and backgrounds, and showed it to preschoolers to gain further feedback and was designed to assess their reactions to the content and visuals. According to Dhingra and her colleagues, the greatest strengths of the development of all episodes of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; were the high levels of collaboration between all departments involved in the creation of the show, the clearly defined strategies they used to effectively include their preschool viewers in the development process, and their use of the mission, philosophy, and structure of the program to create and develop each episode.

Most of the show&#x27;s production was done in-house, rather than by outside companies as was customary for children&#x27;s TV shows at the time. &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; was filmed in a studio in Tribeca, Manhattan, New York. The show&#x27;s creators understood that the look and visual design of the show would be integral to children&#x27;s attachment with it. Johnson expanded on the &quot;cut-out&quot; style she had created during her college years. &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; was the first animated series for preschoolers that utilized simple cut-out construction paper shapes of familiar objects with a wide variety of colors and textures, resembling a storybook. Johnson also used primary colors and organized each room of the home setting into groups. The green-striped shirt worn by the show&#x27;s original host, Steve, was inspired by Fruit Stripe gum. The goals were to make the show look natural and simplistic; as Tracy put it, &quot;freshly cut and glued together with a vivid array of textures, colors, and shadows&quot; similar to picture book illustrations. The program&#x27;s design was influenced by an understanding of the cognitive, emotional, and social capabilities of preschoolers. For example, the purpose of the notebook in &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, which was used to record the clues presented throughout an episode, was to teach preschoolers how to overcome their poorly developed memory skills by using external mnemonic aids and lists. The music, produced by composer Michael Rubin and pianist Nick Balaban, was simple, had a natural sound, and exposed children to a wide variety of genres and instruments. Rubin and Balaban used Anderson&#x27;s research about the importance of using auditory cues to increase children&#x27;s attention and inserted auditory signatures to encourage the audience to pay attention to the episodes &quot;at critical junctures for learning&quot;. According to Tracy, the music empowered children and gave the show &quot;a sense of playfulness, a sense of joy, and a sense of the fantastic&quot;. Rubin and Balaban encouraged the musicians who performed for the show to improvise.

The host performed each episode in front of a &quot;blue screen&quot;, with animation added later. The show&#x27;s digital design department combined high-tech and low-tech methods by creating and photographing three-dimensional objects, then cutting them out and placing them into the background, which made the objects look more real and added perspective and depth. Johnson hired artist Dave Palmer and production company Big Pink to create the animation, which was at that time a new technology, from simple materials like fabric, paper, or pipe-cleaners, and scan them into a Macintosh computer so that they could be animated using inexpensive computer software such as Media 100, Ultimatte, Photoshop, and After Effects. instead of being repeatedly redrawn as in traditional animation. Johnson credited Kessler with the idea of using the Macintosh. The result was something that looked different from anything else on television at the time, and the producers were able to animate two episodes in eight weeks, as compared to the sixteen weeks necessary to create a single episode by traditional methods. Their process looked like traditional cut-out animation, but was faster, more flexible, and less expensive, and it allowed them to make changes based on feedback from test audiences. Unlike traditional animation environments, which tended to be highly structured, the animators were given information about the characters and goals of the scenes they would animate, and then given the freedom to work out the timing and look of each scene themselves, as long as their creations were true to the characters and to the story. By 1999, the show&#x27;s animation department consisted of Palmer, twenty animators, eleven digital designers, and five art directors and model makers. By 2002, Nickelodeon had built a &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; $6 million digital animation studio that housed 140 people, including 70 animators.

== Reception ==
Ratings for &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; were high during its first season, and it was Nickelodeon&#x27;s most popular preschool program. It has been described as the first commercial television show for preschoolers that was both educational and profitable. Its creators met regularly with businesses that developed &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; merchandise and products to ensure toys that were educational and met &quot;the same high ... standards as the show&quot;. Products, like the show, were heavily tested prior to marketing. &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; had sold almost 40 million units of its 45 VHS and DVD titles by 1998 and generated over $1 billion in product licensing in 2000. More than ten million &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; books were in print by 2001 and over three million copies of six CD-ROM titles based on the show had been sold. Seven &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; titles sold at least 1 million copies each. The show&#x27;s first direct-to-video production was &quot;Blue&#x27;s Big Musical Movie&quot; (2000), featuring Ray Charles and The Persuasions; it received mostly positive reviews and has sold over 3 million copies since 2006. The launch of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; products at FAO Schwarz&#x27;s flagship store in New York City was the most successful product launch in the store&#x27;s history and was attended by over 7,000 people. Steve Burns&#x27; final episode in 2002 was viewed by 1.9 million preschoolers and received a 47 percent share of the overall audience. By 2002, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; had received several awards for children&#x27;s programming, educational software, and licensing. It won eight consecutive Emmys between 1998 and 2005 and won a Peabody Award in 2001.

Starting in 1999, a live production of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; toured the U.S. to positive reviews. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances. The creators of the TV show were involved in all aspects of the live show, aiming to translate the bond between the TV show&#x27;s audience and its cast to the stage. The creators chose Jonathan Hochwald as the live show&#x27;s producer, Gip Hoppe as its director, and Dave Gallo as its set designer. Neither Hoppe nor Gallo had any previous experience in children&#x27;s theater. Nick Balaban and Michael Rubin, who wrote the music for the TV show, composed the live show&#x27;s soundtrack. The producers were concerned with children&#x27;s response to the host, who was played by Tom Mizer (a different actor than the host of the TV show), but his young audience enthusiastically accepted and embraced him. Actors were encouraged to improvise and respond to the audience, which resulted in changes throughout the show&#x27;s run. The show&#x27;s script included humor that both children and their parents could enjoy.

Regional versions of the show, featuring native hosts, have been produced in other countries. Kevin Duala hosted the United Kingdom version and the show became part of pop culture in South Korea. In total, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; was syndicated in 120 countries, and was translated into 15 languages. In 2000, it became one of the first preschool shows to incorporate American Sign Language into its content, with between five and ten signs used consistently in each episode. &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; won an award from the Greater Los Angeles Agency on Deafness (GLAD) for promoting deaf awareness in the media.

== Cultural influence and impact ==
The extensive use of research in the development and production process of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; inspired several studies that provided evidence for its effectiveness as a learning tool. As Anderson and his colleagues reported, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; had &quot;a beneficial cognitive and social impact&quot; the longer younger children watched it, which increased steadily over time, and that its benefits to cognitive development are both durable and cumulative. They also believed that the research conducted on the program demonstrated that when children&#x27;s television programs were based on information gained from child development concepts, had a systematic curriculum, and were designed with &quot;a research-based understanding of how children use and understand television, it can be a powerful and positive influence&quot;. As they stated, &quot;it appears that the program is not only doing well, but it is also doing good”. In 2004, Anderson said that &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; &quot;raised the bar&quot; for educational television; he and &quot;Variety&quot; reported that audience participation became an important part of other educational preschool TV programs such as &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Anderson also reported that after &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, all of Nickelodeon&#x27;s educational programming included the use of formative research.

In 2019, shortly after the premiere of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues &amp; You&quot;, &quot;the New York Times&quot; called &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; &quot;something of a throwback: a leisurely paced, unflashy show with the educational bona fides of its public TV predecessors &quot;Mr. Rogers&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;&quot;. It also stated that &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; paved the way for shows like &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot;. The program was the first children&#x27;s cable show built entirely around direct address, the first to invite preschoolers to play along with the characters with games and &quot;mini-mysteries&quot;, and the first to include built-in silences designed for child participation. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;The show was interactive before interactivity became mundane&quot;.

Based on anecdotal evidence that preschoolers enjoyed repeated viewings of the programs they watched on television, including Anderson&#x27;s own experience with his four-year-old daughter, who asked to watch a tape of the pilot of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; 17 times, the producers decided to repeat each episode daily for a week. Despite no published evidence that repeated viewings resulted in increased comprehension, especially for younger viewers, and would reinforce the problem-solving skills taught in each episode, and because they did not have enough money to produce a full season of episodes, Nickelodeon agreed to their broadcast strategy, and they were the first network to experiment with the approach. In the summer of 1996, before the premiere of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, Santomero, Anderson, and Wilder conducted a study, funded by Nickelodeon, about the effect of repeated viewings of the pilot episode on its viewers and their ability to learn the curriculum content contained in the episode.

Anderson reported that the results of the study were &quot;clear, striking, and to us, very interesting&quot;. They found that except for the five-year-old boys they tested, audience participation greatly increased with repetition, especially for the problem-solving portions of an episode, as did their comprehension and problem solving. Anderson stated, &quot;As children learned how to solve the problems they would shout out the answers, talk to Steve, point to the screen, jump up with excitement, and so on&quot;. After five viewings, children had also become skilled at solving similar problems that had not been presented in the episode. Anderson reported that the repetition broadcast strategy worked during the program&#x27;s first year. Nickelodeon used the same strategy for its premiere of &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot; in 2000, and Nielsen ratings for both programs indicated no change in audience size during the time the repetitions aired. The study also demonstrated that watching &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; changed how children watch television and that their problem-solving skills and interaction would transfer to other programs they watched.

In 1999, Anderson and a team of researchers, some of which were his colleagues at Nickelodeon, studied how episode repetition affected comprehension, audience participation, and visual attention. The researchers tested whether repeated viewings of the show resulted in mastery over the material presented, or whether viewers would habituate to what they watched or become bored. The study demonstrated that for the first few repetitions, children pay close attention to the educational content because it was more cognitively demanding. The researchers concluded that audience participation was lower because children were devoting more of their cognitive resources to understanding and solving the problem presented in the episode. When they mastered the problems, which the researchers suspected happened the third time the children viewed the episode, they paid the same amount of attention to the educational content as to the entertainment content, which was less demanding. Audience participation, however, increased because their cognitive resources were freed up and because they knew the answers to the questions asked by the host and other characters. Anderson and his colleagues believed that their study proved that episode repetition appeared to foster their viewers&#x27; empowerment, as demonstrated in the viewers&#x27; enthusiastic efforts to help solve problems the host and other characters posed.

The study also demonstrated that experienced viewers (those familiar with the program) looked less at the screen than inexperienced viewers. All children looked at educational content more than at entertainment content. Experienced viewers looked at content unique to the program, but inexperienced viewers did not distinguish between the two types of content, since for them, all content was new. Experienced viewers interacted with the program more and showed better comprehension of the content than inexperienced viewers, especially when they were exposed to content that was repeated across episodes. As Anderson and his colleagues put it, &quot;These results further support the notion that when content is new and challenging, preschoolers pay greater attention, but when it is in a recurrent format and therefore readily mastered, they interact more&quot;. In other words, &quot;Interaction in &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; to some extent thus reflects mastery&quot;. Nielsen ratings of the show&#x27;s first season, when the same episode was shown daily, were flat over the five-day period, which indicated to Anderson that young children did not tire of its repetition or of its complexity over time. According to Crawley and her colleagues, the producers&#x27; repeat broadcast strategy had no negative effectives of the program&#x27;s ratings and appeared to be a success.

In 2000, another team of researchers, including Anderson, Crawley, and other Nickelodeon colleagues, studied if watching &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; changed the way children watch television and if they learned &quot;an interactive style of television viewing”, meaning that they were more interactive with an episode from a different series than viewers who did not have experience watching &quot;Blue’s Clues&quot;. They compared experienced and unexperienced viewers as they watched an episode of &quot;Big Bag&quot;, a “curriculum-based magazine format” series that aired on Cartoon Network, directed towards approximately the same audience as &quot;Blue’s Clues&quot;. They found that although experienced &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; viewers paid less overall attention to &quot;Big Bag&quot; than inexperienced viewers, their patterns of attention across &quot;Big Bag&quot; were identical to their attention to an episode of Blue&#x27;s Clues. They also demonstrated that viewers had the same amount of comprehension in both programs, but &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; viewers interacted more with &quot;Big Bag&quot; than inexperienced viewers. When the content of &quot;Big Bag&quot; was new and challenging, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; viewers paid more attention, and when it was familiar, either from previous viewings or in a format they recognized, they interacted with it more. In short, Anderson and his colleagues found that &quot;interaction in &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; to some extent reflects mastery&quot; and felt that their study demonstrated that watching &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; changed how young children watch television. Researcher Shalom M. Fisch, however, stated that although the show attempted to be &quot;participatory&quot;, it could not truly be so, because unlike interactive computer games, the viewers&#x27; responses could not change or influence what occurred on-screen.

In 2002, Crawley, Anderson, and their colleagues conducted another study on the effects of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, this time researching whether more experienced viewers mastered the content and cognitive challenges faster and easier than first-time viewers. They surmised that experienced viewers would comprehend and interact more with the recurring and familiar segments of the show designed to aid comprehension, but they found that familiarity with the structure of an individual episode did not provide experienced viewers with an advantage over the inexperienced viewers. Crawley and Anderson also studied whether experienced viewers of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; interacted more with other children&#x27;s TV shows and whether the viewing behaviors they learned from &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; could be transferred to other shows. They found that although experienced viewers of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; interacted with an episode of another series, they did not spend more time watching it than viewers unfamiliar with the show. The researchers stated, &quot;It is apparent that, although preschoolers learn to enthusiastically engage in overt audience participation, they do not, by and large, have a metacognitive understanding of why they do so.&quot;

The 2002 studies demonstrated that experience with watching one TV series affects how children watch other programs, especially in the way they interact with them. They also showed that since children are selective in the material they attend to and that their interaction increases with comprehension and mastery, children tend to pay more attention to novel information and interact more with material they have seen before and mastered. According to Crawley and her colleagues, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; demonstrated that television could empower and influence children&#x27;s long-term motivation for and a love of learning. As they stated, &quot;One need only to watch children watch &quot;Blue’s Clues&quot; to realize that they respond to it with enormous enthusiasm&quot;.

Erin Ryan and her colleagues performed a 2009 study on the effect of the use of American Sign Language (ASL) in &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; episodes. They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for the content and frequency of the signs used and found a high incidence of ASL use by various characters, but that it was inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs. The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the Deaf community was also not clearly explained. The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would become familiar with ASL and with deaf people by these episodes, thus reducing the stigma attached to deafness and hard of hearing individuals. Based on other research about the positive effects of teaching ASL to hearing children, the researchers also speculated that it could lead to an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication. They surmised that deaf children would feel more included and less isolated and have more opportunities to view positive models of ASL and deaf people.

Georgene L. Troseth and her colleagues at Vanderbilt University studied how toddlers used information gained from prerecorded video and from interactions with a person through closed-circuit video, and found that two-year-old children did not learn as much from prerecorded videos because the videos lacked social cues and personal references. Two-year-olds who viewed a video with instructions about how to find a toy in an adjoining room from a non-interactive researcher did not use the information, even though they smiled and responded to questions. Troseth speculated that their research had implications for interactive educational shows like &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, which although was &quot;on the right track&quot; because the host invited interaction with the show&#x27;s viewers, did not provide children with the social cues to solve real-world problems. Troseth stated that repetition, repeated exposure, and familiarity with the show&#x27;s host may increase children&#x27;s ability to learn facts and to use strategies they learn from &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; to solve new problems. Her research suggested that &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; engaged young children and elicited their active participation because they mimicked social interaction.

== 2019 revival ==

On March 6, 2018, Nickelodeon announced a revival of the series, with a new host and 20 new episodes. An open casting call for the show&#x27;s new host occurred in April, and production began in the summer of 2018. On September 13, 2018, it was announced that the show would be titled &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues &amp; You!&quot;, and Josh Dela Cruz would be the host of the revival. The show premiered on November 11, 2019.

<text>As the third mission of the US/Russian Shuttle-Mir Program, STS-71 became the first Space Shuttle to dock with the Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot;. STS-71 began on June 27, 1995, with the launch of Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; from launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The Shuttle delivered a relief crew of two cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Nikolai Budarin to the station and recovered Increment astronaut Norman Thagard. &quot;Atlantis&quot; returned to Earth on July 7 with a crew of eight. It was the first of seven straight missions to &quot;Mir&quot; flown by &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and the second Shuttle mission to land with an eight-person crew after STS-61-A in 1985.

For the five days the Shuttle was docked to &quot;Mir&quot; they were the largest spacecraft in orbit at the time. STS-71 marked the first docking of a Space Shuttle to a space station, the first time a Shuttle crew switched members with the crew of a station, and the 100th crewed space launch by the United States. The mission carried Spacelab and included a logistical resupply of &quot;Mir&quot;. Together the Shuttle and station crews conducted various on-orbit joint US/Russian life science investigations with Spacelab along with the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment-II (SAREX-II) experiment.

The primary objectives of this flight were to rendezvous and perform the first docking between the Space Shuttle and the Russian Space Station Mir on June 29. In the first U.S.-Russian (Soviet) docking in twenty years, &quot;Atlantis&quot; delivered a relief crew of two cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Nikolai Budarin to &quot;Mir&quot;.

Other prime objectives were on-orbit joint United States of America-Russian life sciences investigations aboard SPACELAB/Mir, logistical resupply of the Mir and recovery of US astronaut Norman E. Thagard.

Secondary objectives included filming with the IMAX camera and the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment-II (SAREX-II) experiment.

STS-71 was the 100th U.S. human space launch conducted from Cape Canaveral, the first U.S. Space Shuttle-Russian Space Station docking and joint on-orbit operations; largest spacecraft ever in orbit; and the first on-orbit changeout of Shuttle crew.

The rendezvous sequence began at 15:32:19 EDT with a lift-off in-plane with Mir&#x27;s orbit, at the opening of the 10 minute 19 second launch window. Ascent was nominal with no OMS 1 burn required. The OMS 2 burn, initiated at 42 minutes 58 seconds Mission Elapsed Time, adjusted the orbit to 160 x 85.3 nautical miles. It was the lowest ever perigee altitude flown by an orbiter. This facilitated a very rapid initial catch up rate with Mir of about 880 nautical miles per orbit. Almost three hours later the orbit was raised to more typical values of 210 x 159 nautical miles by the OMS 3 burn.

Docking occurred at 9 am EDT, June 29, using R-Bar or Earth radius vector approach, with &quot;Atlantis&quot; closing in on Mir from directly below. R-bar approach allows natural forces to brake the orbiter&#x27;s approach more than would occur along standard approach directly in front of the space station; also, an R-bar approach minimizes the number of orbiter jet firings needed for approach. The manual phase of the docking began with &quot;Atlantis&quot; about a half-mile (800 m) below Mir, with Gibson at the controls on aft flight deck. Stationkeeping was performed when the orbiter was about from &quot;Mir&quot;, pending approval from Russian and U.S. flight directors to proceed. Gibson then maneuvered the orbiter to a point about from &quot;Mir&quot; before beginning the final approach to station. Closing rate was close to the targeted 0.1 foot per second (30 mm/s), being approximately 0.107 foot per second (33 mm/s) at contact. Interface contact was nearly flawless: less than lateral misalignment and an angular misalignment of less than 0.5 degrees per axis. No braking jet firings had been required. Docking occurred about 216 nautical miles () above Lake Baikal region of the Russian Federation. The Orbiter Docking System (ODS) with Androgynous Peripheral Docking System served as the actual connection point to a similar interface on the docking port on Mir&#x27;s Kristall module. ODS, located in the forward payload bay of &quot;Atlantis&quot;, performed flawlessly during the docking sequence.

When linked, &quot;Atlantis&quot; and Mir formed the largest spacecraft ever in orbit, with a total mass of about 225 metric tons (almost one-half million pounds), orbiting some 218 nautical miles () above the Earth. After hatches on each side opened, STS-71 crew passed into &quot;Mir&quot; for a welcoming ceremony. On the same day, the Mir 18 crew officially transferred responsibility for the station to the Mir 19 crew, and the two crews switched spacecraft.
For the next five days, about 100 hours in total, joint U.S.-Russian operations were conducted, including biomedical investigations, and transfer of equipment to and from &quot;Mir&quot;. Fifteen separate biomedical and scientific investigations were conducted, using the Spacelab module installed in the aft portion of &quot;Atlantis&quot;″s payload bay, and covering seven different disciplines: cardiovascular and pulmonary functions; human metabolism; neuroscience; hygiene, sanitation and radiation; behavioral performance and biology; fundamental biology; and microgravity research. The Mir 18 crew served as test subjects for investigations. Three Mir 18 crew members also carried out an intensive programme of exercise and other measures to prepare for re-entry into gravity environment after more than three months in space.

Numerous medical samples as well as disks and cassettes were transferred to &quot;Atlantis&quot; from &quot;Mir&quot;, including more than 100 urine and saliva samples, about 30 blood samples, 20 surface samples, 12 air samples, several water samples and numerous breath samples taken from &quot;Mir&quot; 18 crew members. Also moved was a broken Salyut-5 computer. Transferred to &quot;Mir&quot; were more than of water generated by the orbiter for waste system flushing and electrolysis; specially designed spacewalking tools for use by the &quot;Mir&quot; 19 crew during a spacewalk to repair a jammed solar array on the Spektr module; and transfer of oxygen and nitrogen from Shuttle&#x27;s environmental control system to raise air pressure on the station, to improve &quot;Mir&quot;″s consumables margin.
The spacecraft undocked on July 4, following a farewell ceremony, with the Mir hatch closing at 3:32 pm EDT. July 3 and hatch on Orbiter Docking System shut 16 minutes later. Gibson compared separation sequence to a &quot;cosmic&quot; ballet: Prior to the &quot;Mir&quot;-&quot;Atlantis&quot; undocking, the &quot;Mir&quot; 19 crew temporarily abandoned station, flying away from it in their Soyuz spacecraft so they could record images of &quot;Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Mir&quot; separating. Soyuz unlatched at 6:55 am EDT, and Gibson undocked &quot;Atlantis&quot; from &quot;Mir&quot; at 7:10 am EDT. Whilst both spacecraft were undocked from &quot;Mir&quot;, the station suffered a computer malfunction and started to drift in attitude. The &quot;Mir&quot; 19 crew performed a hasty re-docking, monitored by &quot;Atlantis&quot;. They subsequently replaced computer hardware allowing them to regain attitude control.

The returning crew of eight equaled the largest crew (STS-61-A, October 1985) in Shuttle history. To ease their re-entry into gravity environment after more than 100 days in space, &quot;Mir&quot; 18 crew members Thagard, Dezhurov and Strekalov lay supine in custom-made recumbent seats installed prior to landing in the orbiter middeck.

Inflight problems included a glitch with General Purpose Computer 4 (GPC 4), which was declared failed when it did not synchronize with GPC 1; subsequent troubleshooting indicated it was an isolated event, and GPC 4 operated satisfactorily for the remainder of mission.

During the SAREX portion of the flight, the crew contacted several schools. One was Redlands High School in Redlands, California. Charlie Precourt was able to contact students, former students and technicians that built the communications package. A cross polarized, dual band yagi antenna array and automatic rotor was installed on the roof of the electronics classroom. A dual band radio was installed inside the radio room of the classroom. The contact window lasted about 10 minutes, during which time, about twelve people were able to ask questions. While most were basic or technical questions, one was peculiar. &quot;What would happen of you sneezed inside your helmet?&quot; Precourt answered that you&#x27;d probably, &quot;spray your face shield a little bit..&quot; and carry on.

==External tank==
The external tank used on this mission (ET-70) was involved in a historic marine salvage court case. The tank was being delivered by barge in November 1994, when the tow vehicle encountered issues in Hurricane Gordon. Their mayday signal was picked up by the oil tanker Cherry Valley, which responded and towed the tug and its cargo to safety. Under the tradition of marine salvage, NASA offered $5 million to the crew of the tanker as a reward, but the United States Department of Justice reduced the offer to $1 million. The tanker company and crew sued and were awarded $6.4 million, believed to be the largest such award in U.S. history. This was reduced to $4.125 million on appeal. The crew split the award with their employer. At least one crew member was able to use his cut of the proceeds to buy a house, which he calls &quot;the house that NASA bought.&quot;

<text>STS-70 was the 21st flight of the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;, and the last of 7 shuttle missions to carry a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS). This was the first shuttle mission controlled from the new mission control center room at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.

STS-70 was also the first flight of the new Block 1 orbiter main engine, designed to improve both engine performance and safety. The mission was launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on July 13, 1995, only six days after the landing of sister ship &quot;Atlantis&quot;, marking the fastest turnaround between flights in the history of the program.

==Preparations and launch==

STS-70 had originally moved ahead of STS-71 because of a delay in the launch of the Russian Spektr laboratory module to the Russian space station Mir. However, on May 31, 1995, shuttle managers assessed damage to the External Tank of STS-70 caused by nesting flicker woodpeckers. The damage consisted of about 71 holes (ranging in size from 4 inches in diameter to 1/2 inch in diameter) in the ETs thermal protection foam insulation. Technicians installed safeguards against additional damage. On June 2, NASA managers decided to delay the launch of &quot;Discovery&quot; in order to make repairs to the insulation, and STS-71 was moved ahead of STS-70. &quot;Discovery&quot; was rolled back to the VAB on June 8, and was returned to the pad on June 15.

Launch occurred on July 13, 1995, at 9:41:55.078 a.m. EDT. The launch window was 2 hours 30 min. The hatch was closed at 8:13am EDT and the count proceeded smoothly until T-31 sec. The count was held for 55 seconds at T-31 sec by the Booster Range Safety Engineer (CBRS) Tod Gracom at the LCC C-5 Console due to fluctuations seen on the external tank automatic gain control (AGC) ET range safety system receiver. Launch Commit Criteria contingency procedures were worked and the count then proceeded on schedule. STS-70 marked the maiden flight of the new Block 1 orbiter main engine. Engine number 2036 featured the new high-pressure liquid oxygen turbopump, a two-duct powerhead, baffleless main injector, single-coil heat exchanger and start sequence modifications. The Block I engine flew in the number one position on &quot;Discovery&quot;. The other two engines were of the existing Phase II design.

==Mission highlights==

The primary mission was the launch and deployment of the 7th Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-G) by means of the two-stage Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) solid rocket. It was built by TRW and weighs about . The satellite was ejected from &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; cargo bay exactly on time at 2:55 p.m. CDT, approximately six hours into the flight. The release of the satellite was overseen by Mission Specialists Donald Thomas and Mary Ellen Weber.

About 15 minutes later, &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; Commander Tom Henricks fired the shuttle&#x27;s engines to raise the orbit and move away from the vicinity of the satellite and the IUS. At about 3:55 p.m., the IUS fired the first of two burns that would put TDRS-G into its proper, 22,000-mile-high geostationary orbit above the central Pacific Ocean at 178 degrees West longitude.

The deployment operations utilized three separate control centers; the White Sands ground station controlled the TDRS, the JSC Mission Control Center (MCC) controlled the shuttle, and the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) control center at Onizuka Air Force Base in Sunnyvale California controlled the booster stage. Once it reached its destination, the fully deployed satellite had a wingspan of 57 ft. The TDRS was the sixth placed in operational use. TDRS-1 was launched aboard STS-6 on 1983-04-04 with a scheduled lifetime of seven years. The second satellite, TDRS-B, was lost aboard &quot;Challenger&quot; on mission STS-51-L. TDRS-3 was deployed from STS-26, TDRS-4 from STS-29, TDRS-5 from STS-43 and TDRS-6 was deployed by STS-54. The on-orbit TDRS network was rearranged and included two fully operational spacecraft occupying the TDRS East and West slots, one on-orbit fully functional spare, TDRS-1, which was nearly depleted having exceeded its planned lifetime, and the partially operational TDRS-3 spacecraft dedicated to supporting the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory and providing coverage an area that can&#x27;t be seen by the other satellites known as the Zone of Exclusion.

==Additional payloads and experiments==

Secondary objectives of the mission were to fulfill the requirements of the Physiological and Anatomical Rodent Experiment / National Institutes of Health-Rodents (PARE/NIH-R); Bioreactor Demonstration System (BDS), Commercial Protein Crystal Growth (CPCG); Space Tissue Loss/National Institutes of Health-Cells (STL/NIH-C); Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC); Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment-II (SAREX-II), Visual Function Tester-4 (VFT-4); Hand-Held, Earth Oriented, Real-Time, Cooperative, User-Friendly, Location-Targeting and Environmental System (HERCULES); Microcapsules in Space-B (MIS-B); Windows Experiment (WINDEX); Radiation Monitoring Equipment-III (RME-III); and the Military Applications of Ship Tracks (MAST).

The Bioreactor Demonstration System was designed to use ground-based and space-bioreactor systems to grow individual cells into organized tissue that is morphologically and functionally similar to the original tissue or organ. The BDS was composed of a device developed at the Johnson Space Center that used a rotating cylinder to suspend cells and tissues in a growth medium, simulating some aspects of microgravity. The system, which was already used extensively in ground-based research, also provided for gas and nutrient exchange. The purpose of the flight experiment was to demonstrate the performance of the bioreactor in actual microgravity. As such, the primary goal was to assess the fluid dynamic characteristics of the bioreactor in microgravity.

A club membership patch from the world famous Coney Island Polar Bear Club was carried on this mission.

==Landing==

Landing opportunities at the Kennedy Space Center at 7:54 am EDT and 9:31 am July 21, 1995, were waved off due to a buildup of ground fog over the Shuttle Landing Facility. Flight Director Rich Jackson directed the five STS-70 astronauts to remain aloft for another day after poor visibility prevented &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s homecoming on the two consecutive landing opportunities. Discovery&#x27;s astronauts were informed that their landing had been waved off for the day at 7:10am CDT after astronaut Steve Oswald, flying weather reconnaissance in a Shuttle Training Aircraft over the landing strip, reported that he could not see the three-mile-long runway from his vantage point.
STS-70 landed at the Kennedy Space Center on July 22, 1995, at 8:02 a.m. EDT on Runway 33. Nose gear touchdown occurred at 8:02:11 am EDT (Mission Elapsed Time of 8 days 22 hours 20 minutes and 16 seconds) with wheels stop at 8:02:57 am (MET of 8 d 22 h 21 min 2 s). An earlier KSC landing opportunity at 6:26 am EDT was waved off due to marginal yet improving weather conditions at KSC.

==Mission highlights==
The 11-day mission was the second flight of the Wake Shield Facility (WSF), a saucer-shaped satellite that was to fly free of the Shuttle for several days. The purpose of the WSF was to grow thin films in a near perfect vacuum created by the wake of the satellite as it moved through space. The crew also deployed and retrieved the Spartan 201 astronomy satellite, performed a six-hour spacewalk to test assembly techniques for the international Space Station and tested thermal improvements made to spacesuits used during space walks.

The Spartan 201 free-flyer made its third flight aboard the Shuttle. The Spartan 201 mission was a scientific research effort aimed at the investigation of the interaction between the Sun and its outflowing wind of charged particles. Spartan&#x27;s goal was to study the outer atmosphere of the Sun and its transition into the solar wind that constantly flows past the Earth.

STS-69 saw the first flight of the International Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker (IEH-1), the first of five planned flights to measure and monitor long-term variations in the magnitude of absolute extreme ultraviolet (EUV) flux coming from the Sun, and to study EUV emissions from the plasma torus system around Jupiter originating from its moon Io.

Also aboard &quot;Endeavour&quot; were the combined Capillary Pumped Loop-2/Gas Bridge Assembly (CAPL-2/GBA) payload. This experiment consisted of the CAPL-2 Hitchhiker payload designed as an in-orbit microgravity demonstration of a cooling system planned for the Earth Observing System Program and the Thermal Energy Storage-2 payload, part of an effort to develop advanced energy generation techniques. Also a part of this payload were several Getaway Special (GAS) experiments which investigated areas such as the interaction of spacecraft attitude and orbit control systems with spacecraft structures, fluid-filled beams as structural dampers in space and the effects of smoldering combustion in a long-term microgravity environment.

Another payload flown with a connection to the development of the Space Station was the Electrolysis Performance Improvement Concept Study (EPICS). Supply of oxygen and hydrogen by electrolyzing water in space plays an important role in meeting NASA&#x27;s needs and goals for future space missions. On-board generation of oxygen was expected to reduce the annual resupply requirement for the Space Station by approximately .

Other payloads aboard were the National Institutes of Health- Cells-4 (NIH-C4) experiment that investigates bone loss during space flight; the Biological Research in Canister-6 (BRIC-6) that studies the gravity-sensing mechanism within mammalian cells. Also flying were two commercial experiments. (CMIX-4) whose objectives included analysis of cell change in microgravity along with studies of neuro-muscular development disorders and the Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus-7 (CGBA-7). CGBA was a secondary payload that served as an incubator and data collection point for experiments in pharmaceuticals testing and biomedicine, bioprocessing and biotechnology, agriculture and the environment.

The Thermal Energy Storage (TES-2) experiment was also part of the CAPL-2/GBA-6. The TES-2 payload was designed to provide data for understanding the long-duration behavior of thermal energy storage fluoride salts that undergo repeated melting and freezing in microgravity. The TES-2 payload was designed to study the microgravity behavior of voids in lithium fluoride–calcium fluoride eutectic, a thermal energy storage salt. Data from this experiment would validate a computer code called TESSIM, useful for the analysis of heat receivers in advanced solar dynamic power system designs.

<text>STS-73 was a Space Shuttle program mission, during October–November 1995, on board the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. The mission was the second mission for the United States Microgravity Laboratory. The crew, who spent 16 days in space, were broken up into 2 teams, the red team and the blue team. The mission also included several Detailed Test Objectives or DTO&#x27;s.

The second United States Microgravity Laboratory (USML-2) Spacelab mission was the prime payload on STS-73. The 16-day flight continued a cooperative effort of the U.S. government, universities and industry to push back the frontiers of science and technology in &quot;microgravity&quot;, the near-weightless environment of space.

On October 26, through pre-recorded video, Mission Commander Ken Bowersox threw out the first pitch for Game 5 of the 1995 World Series between the Cleveland Indians and the Atlanta Braves from orbit.

Some of the experiments carried on the USML-2 payload were suggested by the results of the first USML mission that flew aboard &quot;Columbia&quot; in 1992 during STS-50. The USML-1 mission provided new insights into theoretical models of fluid physics, the role of gravity in combustion and flame spreading, and how gravity affects the formation of semiconductor crystals. Data collected from several protein crystals grown on USML-1 enabled scientists to determine the molecular structures of those proteins.

USML-2 built on that foundation. Technical knowledge gained was incorporated into the mission plan to enhance procedures and operations. Where possible, experiment teams refined their hardware to increase scientific understanding of basic physical processes on Earth and in space, as well as to prepare for more advanced operations aboard the International Space Station and other future space programs.

USML-2 Flight controllers and experiment scientists directed science activities from NASA&#x27;s Spacelab Mission Operations Control facility at the Marshall Space Flight Center. In addition, science teams at several NASA centers and universities monitored and supported operations of a number of experiments.

Other payloads on board included the Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment (OARE), Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS), Three Dimensional Microgravity Accelerometer (3DMA), Suppression of Transient Accelerations By Levitation Evaluation (STABLE) and the High-Packed Digital Television Technical Demonstration system.

Launch was originally scheduled for 25 September 1995 but endured six scrubbed launch attempts before its 20 October 1995 lift off. STS-73 and STS-61C both carry the distinction of being tied for the most scrubbed launches, each having launched on their seventh attempt.

After the mission, five of the crew members, namely, Bowersox, Coleman, Thornton, Leslie, and Sacco appeared on the 13 February 1996 episode of &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;, on a segment of &quot;Tool Time&quot;. It was Bowersox&#x27;s second time on the show.

<text>STS-74 was the fourth mission of the US/Russian Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; program, and the second docking of the Space Shuttle with &quot;Mir&quot;. Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; lifted off from Kennedy Space Center launch pad 39A on 12 November 1995. The mission ended 8 days later with the landing of &quot;Atlantis&quot; back at Kennedy. It was the second in a series of seven straight missions to the station flown by &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

The shuttle delivered a pair of solar arrays along with the Russian-built Mir Docking Module to allow docking with the station by the space shuttle without moving &quot;Mir&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Kristall&quot; module. During the three-day docking, the Russian, Canadian, and American crew transferred supplies and equipment between &quot;Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Mir&quot;, moved several long-term experiments, and upgraded the station with new equipment, particularly during the installation of the docking module.

==Mission background==

The crew&#x27;s preparation for the mission had begun some thirteen months earlier in 1994, with the crew being trained in the operation of the space shuttle, the mating and docking procedures that would be required as &quot;Atlantis&quot; approached &quot;Mir&quot; later in the mission, and the management of the various scientific experiments being carried on the orbiter during the mission.

Preparation of &quot;Atlantis&quot; itself for mission STS-74 began with the replacement of three thrusters in &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27;s right-hand Orbital Maneuvering System pod in bay 2 of the Orbiter Processing Facility on 25 August 1995. Installation of the three Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) on &quot;Atlantis&quot; was completed on 5 September 1995, as were closeout operations on the Russian docking module.

On 7 November, engineers determined that there was no additional work needed to verify the solid rocket boosters for flight, following discovery of small cracks in the hold-down posts attached to boosters that had flown earlier that year. Close inspections of the STS-74 stack determined that no such cracks were present on the boosters to be used for the mission.

Pad 39A was cleared on 9 November in preparation for loading of the onboard cryogenic tanks with the cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen reactants that provided electricity through the three onboard fuel cells, and water for the flight as a by-product.

The initial launch attempt, scheduled for 11 November 1995 at 7:56 am EST (12:56 UTC) was postponed due to poor weather at the Transatlantic Abort (TAL) site. The original launch window was 6 min 57 secs and the countdown had begun on schedule. The crew was on board when the postponement was called at the T-minus 5 minute mark at approximately 7:51 am EST (12:51 UTC).

==Mission timeline==

===12 November (launch and flight day 1)===

Following a poll of the mission management team at 7:12 am EST in which all stations (with the exception of the Shuttle Range Officer) returned a &quot;go for launch&quot; and the eventual clearance of the range for launch at 7:20 am EST, &quot;Atlantis&quot; raced into the sky at the beginning of a 10-minute, 9-second launch window following a flawless countdown with no unscheduled holds. The shuttle lifted off the pad at 7:30:43 am EST; the main engines were shut down at 7:39 am EST.

About 43 minutes after launch, a 2-minute and 13 second engine firing changed the shuttle&#x27;s path into a 162 nautical mile circular orbit. Once on orbit, the five crew members began configuring &quot;Atlantis&quot; for on-orbit operations. &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27;s payload bay doors were opened about 90 minutes into the flight, followed by a &quot;go&quot; for on-orbit operations.

Approximately three hours into the flight, Commander Ken Cameron and Pilot Jim Halsell fired the orbiter&#x27;s reaction control thrusters in the first of a series of rendezvous burns that refined &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27;s path towards &quot;Mir&quot;. Shortly after the burn, the first Canadian mission specialist, Chris Hadfield, activated the Russian-built docking module, housed in the shuttle&#x27;s payload bay, ready for the docking of the module with &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27;s Orbiter Docking System on flight day 2.

===13 November (flight day 2)===

The five-member crew aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; spent the bulk of their first full day in space readying the orbiter and its payloads for the mating of the Russian docking module to the Orbiter Docking System in advance of the 15 November docking to &quot;Mir&quot;. Both the module and the docking system were located in &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27;s payload bay.

Mission specialists Jerry Ross and Bill McArthur inspected the spacesuits they would don should a spacewalk become necessary during the mating or docking operations. Following the space suit inspection, Mission Specialist Chris Hadfield powered up the orbiter&#x27;s robot arm in preparation for the next day&#x27;s transfer of the docking module over to &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27;s docking system. All systems affiliated with the robot arm operated as expected and were ready to support the mating.

The crew members also checked out the Advanced Space Vision System, a precise alignment system for the robot arm that was tested on STS-74. The OSVS, which was used during the mating operation, consisted of a series of large dots placed on the exterior of the docking module and the docking system.

The day&#x27;s schedule also included the installation and alignment of the centerline camera in the centre of the Orbiter Docking System. The camera later assisted Commander Ken Cameron in final piloting tasks as &quot;Atlantis&quot; moved towards and docked with Mir. At 5:00 am CST (11:00 UTC) on day 2, Atlantis was about 4,000 statute miles behind &quot;Mir&quot;, and was closing in to the space station at a rate of about 380 statute miles per orbit.

Cameron, Hadfield and other available crew members also spent the morning answering questions posed by Canadian reporters located in Montreal and Toronto. Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency astronaut, was the fourth Canadian astronaut to fly on the shuttle.

With all of the systems that were to put the Russian Docking Module in place for a flight day 4 link-up with &quot;Mir&quot; checked out and ready to go, the STS-74 crew settled down for 8 hours of sleep that afternoon.

===14 November (flight day 3)===
On flight day 3, the STS-74 crew members successfully mated the 15-foot Russian built docking module with the shuttle&#x27;s Orbiter Docking System. No problems were reported during the mating operation.

Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency astronaut and STS-74 mission specialist, used the shuttle&#x27;s robot arm to hoist the docking module out of the aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within five inches of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, and a series of hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.

The mating was confirmed at 1:17 am CST, with &quot;Atlantis&quot; over eastern Europe on its 30th orbit. Shortly after the capture, Commander Ken Cameron expressed the crew&#x27;s appreciation for the training that prepared them for the docking module installation.

At about 3:00 am CST, the crew received a go from ground flight controllers to ungrapple the robot arm from the docking module. Shortly after that, crew members raised the orbiter&#x27;s cabin pressure from 10.2 pounds per square inch to 14.7 psi. The cabin&#x27;s pressure was lowered in the event that a problem during the mating process necessitated an emergency spacewalk.

Crew members also mounted a centerline camera into the top hatch of the docking module. The camera later provided the primary visual cue for Cameron as he maneuvered Atlantis to its docking with Mir on flight day four.

By 5:00 am EST, Atlantis was trailing &quot;Mir&quot; by about 1,450 statute miles and closing at a rate of about 180 statute miles every orbit. A series of rendezvous jet firings later further refined the closing rate, leading up to a docking with Mir at 06:27:38 UTC on 15 November.

===15 November (flight day 4 and docking)===

&quot;Atlantis&quot; finally docked to &quot;Mir&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Kristall&quot; module using the docking module&#x27;s top androgynous unit on flight day 4. The tension was high aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot; as Cameron maneuvered the shuttle towards &quot;Mir&quot; using the orbiter&#x27;s thrusters. &quot;Atlantis&quot; docked with &quot;Mir&quot; at 06:27:38 UTC following a faultless set of orbital maneuvers. After all the required checks had been completed and the hatches had been opened, the five shuttle astronauts moved into &quot;Mir&quot;, ready to carry out three days of combined operations with &quot;Mir&quot;&#x27;s resident crew, Russian cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Avdeyev (carrying out the Mir EO-20 expedition) and ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter (flying on the Euromir 95 expedition). The two crews greeted each other with handshakes and hugs before carrying out a traditional gift exchange, with flowers and chocolates being swapped between the crews.

===16–19 November (flight days 5–8)===

During the three days of combined Shuttle-Mir operations, &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27;s crew transferred various items from the shuttle to the space station, including water, supplies, and equipment, along with two new solar arrays (one Russian and one jointly-developed) to upgrade &quot;Mir&quot;.

The crew also transferred various experiment samples, equipment for repair and analysis and products manufactured on &quot;Mir&quot; back to &quot;Atlantis&quot; for transfer back to Earth, along with the University of California Berkeley Trek Experiment which had been flying on orbit aboard &quot;Mir&quot; for the previous four years.

Meanwhile, flying aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot; was the GPP payload which consisted of two experiments – the GPP experiment and the Photogrammetric Appendage Structural Dynamics Experiment (PASDE). The payload was managed by Goddard Space Flight Center&#x27;s Special Payloads Division. The GPP studied the Earth&#x27;s thermosphere, ionosphere and mesosphere energetics and dynamics using broadband spectroscopy. GPP also studied spacecraft interactions with the atmosphere by observing shuttle and &quot;Mir&quot; glow, shuttle engine firings, water dumps and fuel cell purges.

Three PASDE canisters, located throughout the cargo bay, also photogrammetrically recorded structural response data of the &quot;Mir&quot; solar arrays during the docked phase of the mission. This data was later analyzed on the ground to verify the use of photogrammetric techniques to characterize the structural dynamics of the array, thus demonstrating that this technology would result in cost and risk reduction for the International Space Station.

At 08:15:44 UTC on 18 November, &quot;Atlantis&quot; undocked from the docking module&#x27;s bottom androgynous unit, leaving the docking module permanently attached to the &quot;Kristall&quot; module, where it provided clearance between the shuttle and &quot;Mir&quot;&#x27;s solar arrays during subsequent dockings.

===20 November (flight day 9 and landing)===

Flight day 9 consisted primarily of preparations for landing, and the landing itself. &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27;s deorbit burn was performed on orbit 128 at around 11:00 am EST (16:00 UTC), leading to a landing at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, on Runway 33 of the Shuttle Landing Facility.

The main landing gear touched down at 12:01:27 pm EST (17:01:27 UTC) on 20 November, a mission elapsed time (MET) of 8 days 4 hours 30 minutes and 44 seconds. Nose gear touched down at 8 days 4 hours 30 minutes 54 seconds (12:01:37 pm EST – 17:01:37 UTC) and &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; wheels stopped at a MET of 8 days 4 hours 31 minutes 42 seconds (12:02:24 pm EST – 17:02:24 UTC), bringing the 73rd space shuttle mission to a close.

A second landing opportunity had been planned in case of bad weather, for a KSC landing at 1:37 pm EST with a deorbit burn at 12:36 pm on orbit 129, but it was not required.
