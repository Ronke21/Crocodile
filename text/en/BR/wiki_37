<text>Adam de la Halle (1245–50 – 1285–8/after 1306) was a French poet-composer &quot;trouvère&quot;. Among the few medieval composers to write both monophonic and polyphonic music, in this respect he has been considered both a conservative and progressive composer, resulting in a complex legacy: he cultivated admired representatives of older trouvère genres, but also experimented with newer dramatic works. Adam represented the final generation of the &quot;trouvère&quot; tradition and &quot;has long been regarded as one of the most important musical and literary figures of thirteenth-century Europe&quot;.

Adam&#x27;s literary and musical works include chansons and jeux-partis (poetic debates) in the style of the &quot;trouvères&quot;; polyphonic rondel and motets in the style of early liturgical polyphony; and a musical play, &quot;Jeu de Robin et Marion&quot; (), which is considered the earliest surviving secular French play with music. He was a member of the Confrérie des jongleurs et bourgeois d&#x27;Arras, a fraternity of jongleurs.

==Life and career==
Adam&#x27;s other nicknames, &quot;le Bossu d&#x27;Arras&quot; and &quot;Adam d&#x27;Arras&quot;, suggest that he came from Arras, France. The sobriquet &quot;the Hunchback&quot; was probably a family name; Adam himself points out that he was not one. His father, Henri de la Halle, was a well-known Citizen of Arras, and Adam studied grammar, theology, and music at the Cistercian abbey of Vaucelles, near Cambrai. The father and son had their share in the civil discords in Arras, and for a short time took refuge in Douai. Adam had been destined for the church, but renounced this intention, and married a certain Marie, who features in many of his songs, &quot;rondeaux&quot;, motets and &quot;jeux-partis&quot;. Afterwards he joined the household of Robert II, Count of Artois; and then was attached to Charles of Anjou, brother of Louis IX, whose fortunes he followed in Egypt, Syria, Palestine, and Italy.

At the court of Charles, after Charles became king of Naples, Adam wrote his &quot;Jeu de Robin et Marion&quot;, the most famous of his works.

==Works==
His known works include thirty-six chansons (literally, &quot;songs&quot;), forty-six &quot;rondets de carole&quot;, eighteen &quot;jeux-partis&quot;, fourteen &quot;rondeaux&quot;, five motets, one &quot;rondeau-virelai&quot;, one &quot;ballette&quot;, one &quot;dit d&#x27;amour&quot;, and one &quot;congé&quot;.

Adam&#x27;s shorter pieces are accompanied by music, of which a transcript in modern notation, with the original score, is given in Edmond de Coussemaker&#x27;s edition. His &quot;Jeu de Robin et Marion&quot; is cited as the earliest French play with music on a secular subject. The pastoral, which tells how Marion resisted the knight, and remained faithful to Robert the shepherd, is based on an old chanson, &quot;Robin m&#x27;aime, Robin m&#x27;a&quot;. It consists of dialogue varied by refrains already current in popular song. The melodies to which these are set have the character of folk music, and are more spontaneous and melodious than the more elaborate music of his songs and motets. Fétis considered &quot;Le Jeu de Robin et Marion&quot; and &quot;Le Jeu de la feuillée&quot; forerunners of the comic opera. An adaptation of &quot;Le Jeu Robin et Marion&quot;, by Julien Tiersot, was played at Arras by a company from the Paris Opéra-Comique on the occasion of a festival in 1896 in honour of Adam de le Hale.

His other play, &quot;Le jeu Adan&quot; or &quot;Le jeu de la Feuillee&quot; (ca. 1262), is a satirical drama in which he introduces himself, his father and the citizens of Arras with their peculiarities. His works include a &quot;congé&quot;, or satirical farewell to the city of Arras, and an unfinished &quot;chanson de geste&quot; in honour of Charles of Anjou, &quot;Le roi de Secile&quot;, begun in 1282; another short piece, &quot;Le jeu du pelerin&quot;, is sometimes attributed to him.

<text>Hezb-e-Islami (also &quot;Hezb-e Islami&quot;, &quot;Hezb-i-Islami&quot;, &quot;Hezbi-Islami&quot;, &quot;Hezbi Islami&quot;), lit. Islamic Party, was an Islamist organization that was commonly known for fighting the Communist Government of Afghanistan and their close ally the Soviet Union. Founded and led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, it was established in Afghanistan in 1976.

It grew out of the Muslim Youth organization, an Islamist organization founded in Kabul by students and teachers at Kabul University in 1969 to combat communism in Afghanistan. Its membership was drawn from ethnic Pashtuns, and its ideology from the Muslim Brotherhood and Abul Ala Maududi&#x27;s Jamaat-e-Islami. Another source describes it as having splintered away from Burhanuddin Rabbani&#x27;s original Islamist party, Jamiat-e Islami, in 1976, after Hekmatyar found that group too moderate and willing to compromise with others.

In 1979, Mulavi Younas Khalis split with Hekmatyar and established his own Hezbi Islami, known as the Khalis faction, with its power base in Nangarhar. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar&#x27;s faction is since then referred to as the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin, or HIG.

<doc id="518774" wikidata="Q507127" url="?curid=518774" title="Voiced velar plosive">
<text>The voiced velar plosive or stop is a type of consonantal sound used in many spoken languages. 

Some languages have the voiced pre-velar plosive, which is articulated slightly more front compared with the place of articulation of the prototypical velar plosive, though not as front as the prototypical palatal plosive.

Conversely, some languages have the voiced post-velar plosive, which is articulated slightly behind the place of articulation of the prototypical velar plosive, though not as back as the prototypical uvular plosive.

==IPA symbol==
The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1. Strictly, the IPA symbol is the so-called single-storey G , but the double-storey G is considered an acceptable alternative. The Unicode character renders as either a single-storey G or a double-storey G depending on font; the character is always a single-storey G, but it is generally available only in fonts supporting the IPA Extensions Unicode character block. 

==Features==
Features of the voiced velar stop:


==Varieties==
==Occurrence==

Of the six stops that would be expected from the most common pattern worldwide—that is, three places of articulation plus voicing ()— and are the most frequently missing, being absent in about 10% of languages that otherwise have this pattern. Absent stop is an areal feature (see also Voiceless bilabial stop). Missing , (when the language uses voicing to contrast stops) on the other hand, is widely scattered around the world, for example /ɡ/ is not a native phoneme of Belarusian, Dutch, Czech, or Slovak and occurs only in borrowed words in those languages. A few languages, such as Modern Standard Arabic and part of the Levantine dialects (e.g. Lebanese and Syrian), are missing both, although most Modern Arabic dialects have in their native phonemic systems as a reflex of or less commonly of .

It seems that is somewhat more difficult to articulate than the other basic stops. Ian Maddieson speculates that this may be due to a physical difficulty in voicing velars: Voicing requires that air flow into the mouth cavity, and the relatively small space allowed by the position of velar consonants means that it will fill up with air quickly, making voicing difficult to maintain in for as long as it is in or . This could have two effects: and might become confused, and the distinction is lost, or perhaps a never develops when a language first starts making voicing distinctions. With uvulars, where there is even less space between the glottis and tongue for airflow, the imbalance is more extreme: Voiced is much rarer than voiceless .

In many Indo-Aryan languages, such as Hindustani, plain [g] and aspirated [gh] are in contrastive distribution.

<text>The Douglas SBD Dauntless is a World War II American naval scout plane and dive bomber that was manufactured by Douglas Aircraft from 1940 through 1944. The SBD (&quot;Scout Bomber Douglas&quot;) was the United States Navy&#x27;s main carrier-based scout/dive bomber from mid-1940 through mid-1944. The SBD was also flown by the United States Marine Corps, both from land air bases and aircraft carriers. The SBD is best remembered as the bomber that delivered the fatal blows to the Japanese carriers at the Battle of Midway in June 1942. The type earned its nickname &quot;Slow But Deadly&quot; (from its SBD initials) during this period.

During its combat service, the SBD proved to be an effective naval scout plane and dive bomber. It possessed long range, good handling characteristics, maneuverability, potent bomb load, great diving characteristics from the perforated dive brakes. By the middle months of 1943 the bomber was considered by pilots to be too vulnerable for service owing to its armament and slow speed, and was relegated to non-combat roles. One land-based variant of the SBD – omitting the arrestor hook — was purpose-built for the U.S. Army Air Forces, as the A-24 Banshee.

==Design and development==

Design work on the Northrop BT-1 began in 1935. In 1937, the Northrop Corporation was taken over by Douglas, and the active Northrop projects continued under Douglas Aircraft Corporation. The Northrop BT-2 was developed from the BT-1 by modifications ordered in November 1937, and provided the basis of the SBD, which first entered service in mid-1939. Ed Heinemann led a team of designers who considered a development with a Wright Cyclone engine. The plane was developed at the Douglas El Segundo, California, plant, and that facility, along with the company&#x27;s Oklahoma City plant, built almost all the SBDs produced. One year earlier, both the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps had placed orders for the new dive bomber, designated the &quot;SBD-1&quot; and &quot;SBD-2&quot; (the latter had increased fuel capacity and different armament). The SBD-1 went to the Marine Corps in late 1940, and the SBD-2 to the Navy in early 1941, replacing the SBU Corsair and Curtiss SBC Helldiver squadrons on US carriers. Distinctive perforated split flaps or &quot;dive-brakes&quot; had been incorporated into the BT-1 to eliminate tail buffeting during diving maneuvers. Unusual for carrier aircraft, folding wings were not chosen for the design, opting instead for structural strength.
The next version was the &quot;SBD-3&quot;, which began manufacture in early 1941. It had increased armor, self-sealing fuel tanks, and four machine guns. The &quot;SBD-4&quot; provided a 12-volt (up from 6-volt) electrical system, and a few were converted into &quot;SBD-4P&quot; reconnaissance aircraft.

The next (and most produced) version, the &quot;SBD-5&quot;, was produced mostly in the Douglas plant in Tulsa, Oklahoma. This version was equipped with a engine and an increased ammunition supply. Over 2,400 of these were built. A few of them were shipped to the Royal Navy for evaluation. In addition to American service, the SBD saw combat against the Japanese Army and Navy with No. 25 Squadron of the Royal New Zealand Air Force—but the RNZAF soon replaced them with the larger, faster, heavier and land-based Vought F4U Corsairs.

Some SBDs were also flown by the Free French Air Force against the German Heer and Luftwaffe. SBDs were also sold to Mexico.

The final version, the &quot;SBD-6&quot;, had more improvements, but its production ended during the summer of 1944.

The U.S. Army Air Forces had its own version of the SBD, called the A-24 Banshee. It lacked the tail hook used for carrier landings, and a pneumatic tire replaced the solid tail wheel. First assigned to the 27th Bombardment Group (Light) at Hunter Field, Georgia, A-24s flew in the Louisiana maneuvers of September 1941. There were three versions of the Banshee (A-24, A-24A and A-24B) flown by the army to a very minor degree in the early stages of the war. The USAAF used 948 of the 5,937 Dauntlesses built.

==Operational history==

===U.S. Navy and Marine Corps===

U.S. Navy and Marine Corps SBDs saw their first action at Pearl Harbor, when most of the Marine Corps SBDs of Marine Scout Bombing Squadron 232 (VMSB-232) were destroyed on the ground at Ewa Mooring Mast Field. Most U.S. Navy SBDs flew from their aircraft carriers, which did not operate in close cooperation with the rest of the fleet. Most Navy SBDs at Pearl Harbor, like their Marine Corps counterparts, were destroyed on the ground. On 10 December 1941, SBDs from sank the Japanese submarine &quot;I-70&quot;. In February–March 1942, SBDs from the carriers , , and , took part in various raids on Japanese installations in the Gilbert Islands, the Marshall Islands, New Guinea, Rabaul, Wake Island, and Marcus Island.

The first major use of the SBD in combat was at the Battle of the Coral Sea where SBDs and TBD Devastators sank the Japanese light aircraft carrier (CVL) and damaged the Japanese fleet carrier . SBDs were also used for anti-torpedo combat air patrols (CAP) and these scored several victories against Japanese aircraft trying to attack &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot;. Their relatively heavy gun armament with two forward-firing  M2 Browning machine guns and either one or two rear flexible-mount  AN/M2 machine guns was effective against the lightly built Japanese fighters, and many pilots and gunners took aggressive attitudes to the fighters that attacked them. SBD pilot Stanley &quot;Swede&quot; Vejtasa was attacked by three A6M2 Zero fighters; he shot down two of them and cut off the wing of the third in a head-on pass with his wingtip. 
The SBD&#x27;s most important contribution to the American war effort came during the Battle of Midway in early June 1942. Four squadrons of Navy SBD dive bombers attacked and sank or fatally damaged all four Japanese fleet carriers present, disabling three of them in the span of just six minutes (, , ) and, later in the day, . They also caught two straggling heavy cruisers of the Midway bombardment group of four, heavily damaging them, with eventually sinking.

At the Battle of Midway, Marine Corps SBDs were not as effective. One squadron, VMSB-241, flying from Midway Atoll, was not trained in the techniques of dive-bombing with their new Dauntlesses (having just partially converted from the SB2U Vindicator). Its pilots resorted to the slower but easier glide bombing technique. This led to many of the SBDs being shot down during their glide, although one survivor from these attacks is now on display at the National Naval Aviation Museum and is the last surviving aircraft to have flown in the battle. The carrier-borne squadrons were effective, especially when they were escorted by Grumman F4F Wildcats. The success of dive bombing resulted from one important circumstance:


SBDs played a major role in the Guadalcanal campaign, operating off both American carriers and from Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. SBDs proved lethal to Japanese shipping that failed to clear New Georgia Sound (The Slot) by daylight. Losses inflicted included the carrier , sunk near the Solomon Islands on 24 August. Three other Japanese carriers were damaged during the six-month campaign. SBDs sank a cruiser and nine transports during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.

In the Atlantic Ocean the SBD saw action during Operation Torch, the Allied landings in North Africa in November 1942. The SBDs flew from and two escort carriers. Eleven months later, during Operation Leader, the SBDs saw their European debut when aircraft from &quot;Ranger&quot; attacked Nazi German shipping around Bodø, Norway.

By 1944 the U.S. Navy began replacing the SBD with the more powerful SB2C Helldiver. During the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, a long range twilight strike was made against the retreating Japanese fleet, at (or beyond) the limit of the combat radius of the aircraft. The force had about twenty minutes of daylight over their targets before attempting the long return in the dark. Of the 215 aircraft, only 115 made it back. Twenty were lost to enemy action in the attack, and 80 were lost as one by one they expended their fuel and had to ditch into the sea. In the attack were 26 SBDs, all of which made it back to the carriers.

The Battle of the Philippine Sea was the last major engagement of the carrier-borne SBDs. Marine squadrons continued to fly SBDs until the end of the war. Although the Curtiss Helldiver had a more powerful engine, a higher maximum speed and could carry nearly a thousand pounds more in bomb load, many of the dive bomber pilots preferred the SBD, which was lighter and had better low-speed handling characteristics, critical for carrier landings.

The Dauntless was one of the most important aircraft in the Pacific War, sinking more enemy shipping in the Pacific than any other Allied bomber. Barrett Tillman, in his book on the Dauntless, claims that it has a &quot;plus&quot; score against enemy aircraft, meaning it was credited with more victories over enemy planes than losses from enemy action. This is considered to be a rare event for a nominal &quot;bomber&quot;.

A total of 5,936 SBDs were produced during the war. The last SBD rolled off the assembly lines at the Douglas Aircraft plant in El Segundo, California, on 21 July 1944. The Navy placed emphasis on the heavier, faster and longer-ranged SB2C. From Pearl Harbor through April 1944, SBDs had flown 1,189,473 operational hours, with 25% of all operational hours flown off aircraft carriers being in SBDs. Its battle record shows that in addition to six Japanese carriers, 14 enemy cruisers had been sunk, along with six destroyers, 15 transports or cargo ships and scores of various lesser craft.

===United States Army Air Forces===
The USAAF sent 52 A-24 Banshees in crates to the Philippines in the fall of 1941 to equip the 27th Bombardment Group, whose personnel were sent separately. However, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, these bombers were diverted to Australia and the 27th BG fought on the Bataan Peninsula as infantry. While in Australia the aircraft were reassembled for flight to the Philippines, but missing parts, including solenoids, trigger motors and gun mounts delayed their shipment. Plagued with mechanical problems, the A-24s were diverted to the 91st Bombardment Squadron and designated for assignment to Java instead.

Referring to themselves as &quot;Blue Rock Clay Pigeons&quot; (after a brand of trap shooting targets), the 91st BS based at Malang attacked the enemy-held harbor and airbase at Bali and damaged or sank numerous ships around Java during the Dutch East Indies campaign. After the Japanese downed two A-24s and damaged three so badly that they could no longer fly, the 91st received orders to evacuate Java in early March 1942.

The A-24s remaining in Australia were assigned to the 8th Bombardment Squadron of 3d Bombardment Group, to defend New Guinea. On 29 July 1942, seven A-24s attacked a convoy off Buna, but only one survived: the Japanese shot down five of them and damaged the sixth so badly that it did not make it back to base. Regarded by many pilots as too slow, short ranged and poorly armed, the remaining A-24s were relegated to non-combat missions. In the U.S., the A-24s became training aircraft or towed targets for aerial gunnery training. The more powerful A-24B was used later against the Japanese forces in the Gilbert Islands. From December 1943 until March 1944, the 531st Fighter Squadron of the 7th Air Force flew A-24Bs from Makin Island in the Gilbert Islands against Japanese controlled islands in the Marshall Islands. The A-24Bs were then withdrawn from combat.

The A-24B (equivalent to the U.S. Navy SBD-5, with the omission of the arrestor hook) arrived in 1943 with the more powerful 1,200-hp Wright R-1820-60 &quot;Cyclone&quot; engine, a more powerful engine than either the A-24 or A-24A. As a result, the A-24B could fly slightly faster and higher than the earlier models. The A-24B lacked the small air intake on the top of the engine cowling present on the earlier models and that is an easy way to distinguish the B model. The 407th Bomb Group, assigned to the 11th Air Force, flew A-24Bs against the Japanese held island of Kiska, Alaska, during July and August 1943.

A handful of A-24s survived in the inventory of the USAAF long enough to be taken over by the Air Force (USAF) when that service became independent of the Army in September 1947. The USAF established a new designation system for its aircraft, eliminating the &quot;A-&quot; (for attack) category (through 1962); all of the single-engined &quot;A-&quot; aircraft were given &quot;F-&quot; (for fighter) nomenclature (or were determined to be obsolete and scrapped); thus the few remaining A-24 Banshees became known as F-24 Banshees, soldiering on in a reserve role until 1950 when they were scrapped.

===French Air Force and Naval Aviation (&quot;Aeronavale&quot;)===
The first production Dauntless sent into action was the &quot;SBD-3&quot;, which was produced for the French Naval Aviation. A total of 174 Dauntlesses were ordered by the French Navy, but with the fall of France in the spring of 1940 that production batch was diverted to the U.S. Navy, which ordered 410 more.

The Free French received about 80 SBD-5s and A-24Bs from the United States in 1944. They were used as trainers and close-support aircraft.
* Free French squadrons received 40 to 50 A-24Bs in Morocco and Algeria during 1943.
* French Naval Aviation (&quot;Aeronautique Navale&quot;) received 32 in late 1944 for Flotilles 3FB and 4FB (16 SBD-5s for each).

Squadron I/17 &quot;Picardie&quot; used a few A-24Bs for coastal patrol. The most combat-experienced of the Banshee units was GC 1/18 &quot;Vendee&quot;, which flew A-24Bs in support of Allied forces in southern France and also experienced how deadly German flak was, losing several aircraft in 1944. This squadron flew from North Africa to recently liberated Toulouse to support Allied and French resistance troops. Later, the unit was assigned to support attacks on cities occupied by the Germans on the French Atlantic coast. In April 1945 each SBD-5 averaged three missions a day in the European theater. In 1946 the French Air Force based its A-24Bs in Morocco as trainers.

French Navy Dauntlesses were based in Cognac at the end of 1944. The French Navy Dauntlesses were the last ones to see combat, during the Indochina War, flying from the carrier &quot;Arromanches&quot; (the former Royal Navy carrier &quot;Colossus&quot;). In late 1947 during one operation in the Indochina War, &quot;Flotille&quot; 4F flew 200 missions and dropped 65 tons of bombs. By 1949, the French Navy removed the Dauntless from combat status although the type was still flown as a trainer through 1953.

===Royal New Zealand Air Force===
The Royal New Zealand Air Force received 18 SBD-3s and 23 SBD-4s and No. 25 Squadron RNZAF used them in combat over the South Pacific. Under the original plan, four Squadrons (25, 26, 27 and 28) of the RNZAF were going to be equipped with the Dauntless but only 25 Squadron used them. The RNZAF soon replaced them with F4U Corsairs.

==Notable accidents==

* On 7 December 1943, during a joint U.S. Navy–U.S. Marine simulated close air support exercise near Pauwela, Maui, Territory of Hawaii, the pilot of a U.S. Navy SBD-5, BuNo &quot;36045&quot; of squadron VB-10, initiated a slight right-hand turn and deployed dive brakes in preparation for a bomb run, but his aircraft was struck by a second VB-10 SBD-5, &quot;36099&quot;, that did not have dive brakes deployed. Both aircraft crashed, and a bomb knocked loose from &quot;36045&quot; fell in the midst of a group of marines and detonated, killing 20 and seriously injuring 24. Both SBD pilots parachuted to safety, but both SBD gunners died, one after an unsuccessful bailout attempt. The collision was attributed to poor judgment and flying technique by both pilots. Aviation Archaeology Investigation &amp; Research gives the date of this accident as 6 December.

<text>The Meritorious Unit Commendation (MUC; pronounced &quot;muck&quot;) is a mid-level unit award of the United States Armed Forces. The U.S. Army awards units the Army MUC for exceptionally meritorious conduct in performance of outstanding achievement or service in combat or non-combat, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps award units the Navy MUC for valorous or meritorious achievement or service in combat or non-combat, and the U.S. Coast Guard awards units the Coast Guard MUC for valorous or meritorious achievement or service not involving combat.

==Army==
;Army Meritorious Unit Commendation:
The Army MUC emblem worn to represent award of the MUC is 1 inches wide and inches in height. The emblem consists of a inch wide gold frame with laurel leaves which encloses a scarlet 67111 ribbon. The previously authorized emblem was a gold color embroidered laurel wreath, 1 inches in diameter on a 2 inches square of olive drab cloth.

The Army MUC (previously called the Meritorious Service Unit Plaque) is awarded to units for exceptionally meritorious conduct in performance of outstanding services for at least six continuous months during the period of military operations against an armed enemy occurring on or after 1 January 1944. Service in a combat zone is not required, but must be directly related to the combat effort. Units based in CONUS are excluded from this award, as are other units outside the area of operation. The unit must display such outstanding devotion and superior performance of exceptionally difficult tasks as to set it apart and above other units with similar missions. The degree of achievement required is the same as that which would warrant award of the Legion of Merit (LOM) to an individual. Recommendations for units larger than a brigade will not be submitted. For services performed during World War II, awards will be made only to service units and only for services performed between 1 January 1944 and 15 September 1946.

The Meritorious Service Unit Plaque was originally established by War Department Circular No. 345 on 23 August 1944. The circular provided that members of units which received the Plaque were entitled to wear the Meritorious Service Unit Insignia, a two-inch square olive drab patch with an image of a golden wreath on the right sleeves of their service coats and shirts, four inches from the end of the sleeve. A gold star placed inside the wreath on the insignia represented additional awards, until War Department Circular No. 54, 1946, provided that additional awards would be shown by placing a gold numeral on the inside of the wreath. In December 1946, the Meritorious Service Unit Plaque was eliminated, replaced with the issue of the Meritorious Unit Commendation. 

A new design of the Meritorious Service Unit Emblem, a solid red ribbon bordered by a golden wreath to be worn on the right breast of the service coat immediately above the pocket, was approved in April 1947. This replaced the sleeve insignia and was to be effective 1 January 1949. On 16 May 1947, Army Regulation 260-15 announced the MUC, granted the wear of the MUC emblem, and provided for the display of the scarlet MUC streamer, with the name of the applicable theater of operations in white letters. On 11 April 1949, The Adjutant General advised D/PA that the stock position was such that the sleeve patch would not be exhausted prior to 1959. By Comment 2, 1 March 1960, Deputy Chief of Staff, Personnel (G-1) stated that for planning purposes, the new Meritorious Service Unit emblem would be authorized for wear on or after 1 January 1961, with wear of the old one prohibited after 30 June 1962. However, the stock level was still so high that the ribbon was not introduced into the supply system until 14 July 1966.

Effective 1 March 1961, the MUC was authorized for units or detachments of the armed forces of the United States for exceptionally meritorious conduct in performance of outstanding services for at least six continuous months (a month is considered 30 calendar days) during military operations against an armed enemy without regard to duties performed or the type of unit performing the duties. Such service is interpreted to relate to combat service support type activities and not to the type of activities performed by senior headquarters, combat, or combat support units.

Effective 11 September 2001, the MUC is authorized for units and/or detachments of the Armed Forces of the United States for exceptionally meritorious performance for at least six continuous months (a month is considered 30 calendar days) during military operations against an armed enemy without regard to type of duties performed or the type of unit performing the duties.

All members of the unit cited for the award are approved to wear the emblem of the MUC. The emblem is thought of as an individual decoration for those in connection with the cited acts and is approved to be worn if they continue as members with the unit or not. Other personnel serving with the unit are approved to wear the emblem to show that the unit is a recipient of the MUC.

The Army Meritorious Unit Commendation is worn after the Valorous Unit Award and before the Superior Unit Award. Additional awards of the Army MUC are denoted by bronze oak leaf clusters.

==Navy and Marine Corps==
;Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation 
The Navy MUC was authorized by SECNAV Notice 1650 on 17 July 1967 and is awarded by the Secretary of the Navy, Chief of Naval Operations, or Commandant of the Marine Corps to any unit of the Navy or Marine Corps that has distinguished itself, under combat or non-combat conditions, by either valorous or meritorious achievement, which renders the unit outstanding compared to other units performing similar service, but not sufficient to justify award of the Navy Unit Commendation. This award may also be conferred upon units of the other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, and the armed forces of friendly foreign nations serving with U.S. Armed Forces, provided such units meet the standards established for Navy and Marine Corps units. To justify this award, the unit must have performed service of a character comparable to that which would merit the award of a Bronze Star Medal, or achievement of like caliber in a non-combat situation, to an individual. Normal performance of duty or participation in many combat missions does not, in itself, justify the award. An award will not be made to a unit for actions of one or more of its component parts, unless the unit performed uniformly as a team in a manner fully justifying collective recognition.
The Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation is worn after the Navy Unit Commendation and before the Navy &quot;E&quot; Ribbon. Additional awards of the Navy MUC are denoted by inch bronze stars.

==Coast Guard==
;Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation
The Coast Guard MUC was established in November 1973, and is awarded in the name of the Commandant of the Coast Guard. The MUC may be awarded to any unit of the Coast Guard that has distinguished itself by either valorous or meritorious achievement or service in support of Coast Guard operations not involving combat. The Commandant may also bestow the award upon a unit of another branch of the Armed Forces of the United States, provided the unit meets the standards established for Coast Guard units. To justify the award, the service performed as a unit must be comparable to that which would meet the award of a Coast Guard Achievement Medal (CGAM) to an individual. Normal performance of duty or participation in a large number of operational missions does not in itself justify the award. A Coast Guard MUC will not be awarded to a large unit for actions of one or more of its sub-units unless the entire unit performed as a team.

The Coast Guard MUC is worn after the Coast Guard Unit Commendation and before the Coast Guard Meritorious Team Commendation. Additional awards of the Coast Guard MUC are denoted by inch gold stars. The MUC may also be awarded with the Operational Distinguishing Device, denoted by a inch silver letter &quot;O&quot; centered on the ribbon.

<doc id="518787" wikidata="Q904921" url="?curid=518787" title="The Sonics">
<text>The Sonics are an American garage rock band from Tacoma, Washington, that formed in 1960. Their aggressive, hard-edged sound has been a major influence on punk and garage music worldwide, and they have been named inspirations to the White Stripes, LCD Soundsystem, Nirvana, The Hives, and other musical artists.

The band performed several early rock standards such as &quot;Louie, Louie&quot;, and &quot;Skinny Minnie&quot; as well as original compositions like &quot;Strychnine&quot;, &quot;Psycho&quot;, and &quot;The Witch&quot;. Their catalogue is generally based around simple chord progressions, often performed with a speed and tonal aggression that was novel for the time, making the band a notable influence on later punk rock bands, such as the Stooges and the Cramps.

==Biography==
===1960s===

The Sonics were formed in 1960 in Tacoma, Washington by teen-aged guitarist Larry Parypa, with the encouragement of his music-loving parents. The earliest lineup included Parypa, drummer Mitch Jaber, and guitarist Stuart Turner; Parypa&#x27;s brother Jerry briefly played saxophone, and their mother occasionally filled in on bass at rehearsals. In 1961, Parypa&#x27;s older brother Andy became the bass player, and Tony Mabin took over as their new saxophone player.

When Turner left for the army, Rich Koch (who had previously played with the Wailers) joined as lead guitarist, and Marilyn Lodge became their first singer, the band having been an instrumental combo up to that point. A new drummer, Bill Dean, replaced Jaber.

Koch and Lodge left the band in 1963. Local star Ray Michelsen became the band&#x27;s singer after having sung with several other popular bands on the local scene. Larry began looking for a drummer to replace Dean, who he felt was uncommitted to the band, and found Bob Bennett playing in a band called the Searchers, with keyboardist Gerry Roslie and sax player Rob Lind. Ray Michelsen was looking to leave the band, so the Parypas hired Bennett, Roslie, and Lind, and let their previous saxophonist Mabin go. The well-known lineup was in place, but the Sonics&#x27; career did not begin in earnest until 1964, when Gerry Roslie started singing lead vocals. With Roslie as lead singer, the band started playing gigs at local venues such as the Red Carpet, Olympia&#x27;s Skateland, the Evergreen Ballroom, Perl&#x27;s (Bremerton), the Spanish Castle Ballroom, and St. Mary&#x27;s Parish Hall.

They soon were scouted by Buck Ormsby, bassist for popular Northwest band the Wailers, and signed to Etiquette Records, the Wailers&#x27; own record label. Their first single was &quot;The Witch&quot; (with Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Keep A-Knockin&quot; as the B-side) in November 1964. The record was popular with local kids, and went on to become the biggest selling local single in the history of the Northwest despite its radio airplay being restricted because of its bizarre subject matter.

Early in 1965, Etiquette released the Sonics&#x27; debut album, &quot;Here Are The Sonics&quot;, which was produced at Audio Recording in Seattle, Washington with famed Pacific Northwest recording engineer Kearney Barton. It was recorded on a two-track tape recorder, with only one microphone to pick up the entire drum kit. It was here that they began to pioneer some of their infamously reckless recording techniques. A second album, &quot;Boom&quot;, was followed in February 1966. During the recording, the Sonics ripped the soundproofing off the walls at the country and western-oriented Wiley/Griffith studio in Tacoma to &quot;get a live-er sound.&quot; The covers of both albums feature the photography of Jini Dellaccio.

Their heyday began to come to a close when the band transferred to Jerden Records in late 1966, and headed to Hollywood to record the poorly selling album &quot;Introducing the Sonics&quot; with Larry Levine at Gold Star Studios. Although it has been rumoured that Jerden executives pushed the Sonics into a more polished sound, the band itself had decided to follow new influences in modern music, resulting in songs that were quite different from their raucous early recordings. The band, however, was not satisfied with the material on &quot;Introducing the Sonics&quot;, calling the cleaner, slicker recordings &quot;the worst garbage&quot;.

The original band fell apart between 1966 and 1968, with members leaving to attend university or join other bands; saxophonist Rob Lind became a fighter pilot in the Vietnam War. Eventually, all of the original members left, except Gerry Roslie, with new members continuing on with the name Sonics (later &#x27;Jim Brady and the Sonics&#x27;) until 1980, although it was a completely different band, at times even incorporating string and horn sections.

===Reformations===
The original Sonics reunited briefly in 1972 for a live show at Seattle&#x27;s Paramount Theater, with the recording of this show released as &quot;Live Fanz Only&quot; by Etiquette. In 1980, a new Sonics fronted by Gerry Roslie recorded the album &quot;Sinderella&quot;, which featured versions of the original band&#x27;s material.

The emergence of punk rock in the late &#x27;70s and grunge in the &#x27;90s led to new interest in the Sonics, and much of their material was re-released by labels in the US and Europe. Larry and Andy Parypa continued performing with various bands in the Northwest, while Roslie, Lind, and Bennett pursued careers outside of music.

A further surge of interest in the Sonics was sparked by the use of their hard-rocking version of Richard Berry&#x27;s &quot;Have Love, Will Travel&quot; in a 2004 Land Rover TV ad.

Their music was further impressed upon younger generations through a movement known as The Beat Army, an online music forum based on Facebook which is operated by author and music producer Paul Collins.

In 2007, the Sonics reunited again, this time for the Cavestomp garage rock festival in Brooklyn (November 2–4, 2007). The line up featured original members Gerry Roslie on vocals and keyboards, Larry Parypa on guitar, and Rob Lind on tenor sax, with Ricky Lynn Johnson (of the Wailers) on drums and Don Wilhelm (of the Daily Flash) on bass and vocals.

In 2008, the Sonics recorded a live session for Mark Lamarr&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 show &quot;God&#x27;s Jukebox&quot; on March 22. They played their first ever shows in London on Friday March 21 and Sunday March 23; later that year, &quot;Have Love, Will Travel&quot; was prominently featured on the soundtrack of Guy Ritchie&#x27;s hit film &quot;RocknRolla&quot;.

Since then, they have played the Primavera Festival in Barcelona, followed by Bilbao, then the Sjock Festival in Belgium, Norway, and the Azkena Rock Festival in Vitoria in the Basque Country.

Their first show in their home region since their last Seattle reunion in 1972 was on Halloween 2008 at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle, where they were introduced and joined onstage for several songs by Steven Van Zandt. Kent Morrill (front man of the Wailers) made a surprise appearance to help sing his signature song &quot;Dirty Robber&quot;. Bob Bennett was also present to sit in on drums albeit only for a few songs and only while Ricky Lynn Johnson played in unison.

In 2009, Freddie Dennis, formerly of Freddie and the Screamers, the Kingsmen, and the Liverpool 5, took Wilhelm&#x27;s place as bassist and vocalist. The following year they released &quot;8&quot;, an EP featuring both live cuts and four new songs produced by Larry Parypa and Jack Endino at Sound House Recording in Seattle.

In 2012, Johnson was replaced by drummer Dusty Watson, who has played with Slacktone, Agent Orange, Dick Dale, the Surfaris, Davie Allan and the Arrows, Lita Ford, the Supersuckers, The Boss Martians, Fur Dixon, Jon and the Nightriders, and others.

The Sonics headlined the fifth annual Muddy Roots Music Festival over Labor Day weekend in 2014. That same year, Muddy Roots Recordings published the previously unreleased song, &quot;Bad Betty,&quot; on a 7&quot; record (split with Mudhoney) for Record Store Day.

On January 21, 2015, the band announced they would be releasing a new album, their first in over 40 years, entitled &quot;This Is The Sonics&quot;. The album was released via their own imprint, Revox on March 31. The band also announced a tour to support the new album.

On May 2, 2016, an announcement was posted by Rob Lind on the band&#x27;s Facebook site that Gerry Roslie and Larry Parypa would no longer be continuing as touring members of the band although they will still be involved in recording and Larry will occasionally be playing live with the band. Their positions are being filled on a touring basis by Jake Cavaliere of the Lords of Altamont on keyboards and Evan Foster of the Boss Martians on guitar.

==Influence==
Kurt Cobain of Nirvana said in an interview with Nardwuar the Human Serviette on CITR-FM, discussing drum sounds, &quot;I, I have to admit...The Sonics recorded very, very cheaply on a two track you know, and they just used one microphone over the drums, and they got the most amazing drum sound I&#x27;ve ever heard. Still to this day, it&#x27;s still my favorite drum sound. It sounds like he&#x27;s hitting harder than anyone I&#x27;ve ever known.&quot;

The White Stripes named The Sonics as one of the bands that influenced them the most, calling them &quot;the epitome of &#x27;60s punk&quot; and claiming they were &quot;harder than the Kinks, and punk long before punk&quot;.

LCD Soundsystem name-checked The Sonics, among other bands, in their debut single, &quot;Losing My Edge&quot;.

Nicholaus Arson of the Hives cites The Sonics&#x27; version of &quot;Have Love, Will Travel&quot; as a favorite.

The German country band the BossHoss named themselves after the Sonics&#x27; song &quot;Boss Hoss&quot;.

A 1993 tribute album entitled &quot;Here Ain&#x27;t The Sonics&quot; was released on PopLlama Records, featuring contributions from Mono Men, Screaming Trees, Thee Headcoats, the Cynics, Mojo Nixon and the Original Sins.

==Band members==

<text>USS &quot;Sampson&quot; (DDG-10), named for Admiral William T. Sampson USN (1840–1902), was a &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy.

== Construction and career ==
&quot;Sampson&quot; was laid down by the Bath Iron Works at Bath in Maine on 2 March 1959, launched on 21 May 1960 by Mrs. John S. Crenshaw and commissioned on 24 June 1961 at the Boston Navy Yard.

===1960s===
Following shakedown off Guantanamo Bay in September, &quot;Sampson&quot; tested and evaluated the Tartar missile system off Puerto Rico. Homeported at Norfolk, Virginia, she conducted further tests and trials in early 1962 before joining Destroyer Squadron 18 (DesRon 18) and Destroyer Division 182 (DesDiv 182) in July. Composed completely of missile ships, DesRon 18 was then the most modern squadron in the Navy. Further radar and missile tests followed in 1963; and, in July, &quot;Sampson&quot; operated in the Midshipman Training Squadron. Finally, in January 1964, &quot;Sampson&quot; fired two Tartar missiles under simulated combat conditions. During 1964, she also underwent her first regular overhaul, and received missile replenishment at sea from helicopters.

In January 1965, &quot;Sampson&quot; sailed for her first Mediterranean deployment, but an electrical fire on the night of 14 January caused extensive damage to her fire control capability and forced her to abbreviate her deployment and enter the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for repairs on 15 March.

The destroyer returned to fleet duties on 24 June. While conducting gunnery exercises, on 17 July, Sampson spotted the 50-foot sailing sloop, &quot;Cecelia Anna&quot;, flying distress signals and rescued her 6 crewmen and mascot puppy moments before the sloop sank. In 1966, &quot;Sampson&quot; conducted gunnery exercises and escort duties near Guantánamo Bay, Cuba; then, in March, she deployed to the Mediterranean for extensive operations with the 6th Fleet. She returned to Norfolk in August. On 28 November, following three weeks of exercises in the Caribbean and additional tests, Sampson got underway to participate in exercise &quot;Lantflex 66&quot; in which she provided ASW and AAW services for the ASW carrier, , and conducted exercises in the Puerto Rico operating area before returning to Norfolk in December.

&quot;Sampson&quot; re-deployed to the Mediterranean in mid-1967. While there, a &quot;Sampson&quot; radarman rescued a German seaman from the harbor at Ferrol, Spain. &lt;&quot;Sampson&quot; visited Rota and El Ferrol, Spain from 10 May to 18 May 1967.

By 25 May 1967, there was evidence that a crisis was brewing in the Middle East that eventually lead up to the Six-Day War, 5-10 Jun 1967. The Sampson was assigned to the USS America CVA-66 task group. This task group also joined up with TG 60.2, the carrier Saratoga CVA-60, and her destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Geis.

On 8 June 1967, the was attacked by Israeli fighter jets aircraft and Israeli Navy motor torpedo boats. The attack killed 34 crew members and wounded 171 crew members. &quot;Sampson&quot; was a member of the force which steamed to rendezvous with the heavily damaged USS Liberty (AGTR-5) on 9 June. &quot;Sampson&quot; was in Souda Bay, Crete 13-18 June 1967.

Leaving the 6th Fleet at the end of August 1967, &quot;Sampson&quot; steamed back to the United States, and soon shifted to her new home port of Charleston, South Carolina.

&quot;Sampson&quot; operated out of Charleston in the Atlantic and Caribbean during 1968 until again deploying to the Mediterranean in September. She returned to Charleston in February 1969 and resumed operations in the Atlantic and the Caribbean until redeploying to the Mediterranean in October of that year. After six months with the 6th Fleet, she returned to Charleston on 28 March 1970.

===1970s===
&quot;Sampson&quot; operated out of Charleston in the western Atlantic until 23 September, when, after only two days&#x27; notice, she got underway for special operations in the Mediterranean. She spent the month of October cruising first with , then with , during the latest Levantine crisis. On 1 November, she stood out of Barcelona, Spain, to return to the United States. &quot;Sampson&quot; entered the mouth of the Cooper River on the 12th, moored at Charleston, and began a leave and upkeep period.

&quot;Sampson&quot; stayed in Charleston into 1971. During the first three months of the new year, she operated in the vicinity of the British West Indies; then prepared for overseas movement. On 9 April, following exercises and type training, &quot;Sampson&quot; steamed out of Charleston, passed Fort Sumter, and headed for the Mediterranean. She cruised with the 6th Fleet for six months, participating in exercises with both American and NATO forces. By 16 October, the guided missile destroyer was back in port at Charleston. She spent the rest of 1971 preparing for regular overhaul.

For four months, from 4 January until 4 May 1972, &quot;Sampson&quot; underwent the first Compressed Regular Overhaul ever attempted on a DDG. From mid-May until 9 July, she was underway for post-overhaul trials, exercises, and refresher training. She was in Charleston during the period 9 July to 18 August, at which time Sampson stood out for her new home port, Athens, Greece. She stopped at Rota, Spain, ten days later and entered Phaleron Bay on 3 October. The guided missile destroyer remained in the Mediterranean, home ported at Athens, Greece throughout 1973 and into 1974. In April 1974, she was in port at Athens.

In 1973 she was dispatched to and docked in Tunis, Tunisia where she provided communication link for Helos of USS Forrestal for the Medjerda River flood. During 1973 she visited Barcelona, Spain, Palma de Majorca, Naples Italy, Mikonos, Crete, Istanbul, Turkey, and Villa France. She met the Soviet Black Seas fleet at the straits of Bosporus during the 1973 Israeli/Arab war.
===1980s===
Sampson underwent a major overhaul in the Portsmouth shipyard during 1980–81. In November 1982 Sampson deployed to the Persian Gulf and later the Mediterranean. After transiting the Suez canal and Red Sea, the Sampson shadowed the Soviet carrier Minsk &amp; cruiser Tashkent in the Indian Ocean, and made port calls in Djibouti, and in Karachi. Sampson was on station off Beirut when the US Embassy was bombed. The ship returned to Mayport, FL in May 1983. From October to December of that year, Sampson was deployed in the eastern Caribbean in support of Operation Urgent Fury.

===1990s===
On 7 August 1990 the Sampson deployed with the USS Saratoga battle group in support of Desert Shield/Storm. Once there the Sampson performed the final Adams class guided missile destroyer deployment as a unit of the Maritime Interception Force, conducting the first boarding and search of a merchant on 28 AUG 1990, during OPERATION DESERT SHIELD and the first diversion of a ship with prohibited cargo. After conducting the first-ever exercise ASROC shot in the Red Sea, USS SAMPSON operated with ships of various NATO navies conducting surveillance and protection of shipping in the approaches to the Suez Canal.

===Decommissioning===
&quot;Sampson&quot; was decommissioned on 24 June 1991 exactly 30 years after commissioning, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 November 1992 and sold for scrap on 25 July 1995. &quot;Sampson&quot; was repossessed by the US Navy on 14 March 2000 after the scrap yard failed to dismantle the ship in a timely manner. On 10 February 2003, the Navy issued a contract to Metro Machine of Philadelphia, Pa to dismantle &quot;Sampson&quot; for $2,900,000. &quot;Sampson&quot; was completely dismantled on 15 October 2003.

<doc id="518790" wikidata="Q869697" url="?curid=518790" title="Rock flour">
<text>Rock flour, or glacial flour, consists of fine-grained, silt-sized particles of rock, generated by mechanical grinding of bedrock by glacial erosion or by artificial grinding to a similar size. Because the material is very small, it becomes suspended in meltwater making the water appear cloudy, which is sometimes known as glacial milk.

When the sediments enter a river, they turn it grey, light brown, iridescent blue-green, or milky white. If the river flows into a glacial lake, the lake may appear turquoise in colour as a result. When flows of the flour are extensive, a distinct layer of a different colour flows into the lake and begins to dissipate and settle as the flow extends from the increase in water flow from the glacier during snow melts and heavy rain periods. Examples of this phenomenon may be seen at Lake Pukaki and Lake Tekapo in New Zealand, Lake Louise, Moraine Lake, Emerald Lake, and Peyto Lake in Canada, Gjende lake in Norway, and several lakes (among others, Nordenskjöld and Pehoé) in Chile&#x27;s Torres del Paine National Park, and many lakes in the Cascade Range of Washington State (including Diablo Lake, Gorge Lake, and Blanca Lake).

==Formation==

Typically, natural rock flour is formed during glacial migration, where the glacier grinds against the sides and bottom of the rock beneath it, but also is produced by freeze-and-thaw action, where the act of water freezing and expanding in cracks helps break up rock formations. Multiple cycles create a greater amount.

Although clay-sized, the flour particles are not clay minerals but typically ground up quartz and feldspar. Rock flour is carried out from the system via meltwater streams, where the particles travel in suspension. Rock flour particles may travel great distances either suspended in water or carried by the wind, in the latter case forming deposits called loess.

==Agricultural use==

Rock flour, artificial or natural, is a source of plant micronutrients (minerals trace elements) widely used in organic farming practices as a soil conditioner. Synonyms in this case include rock dust, rock powders, rock minerals, and mineral fines.

The igneous rocks basalt and granite often contain the highest mineral content, whereas limestone, considered inferior in this consideration, is often deficient in the majority of essential macro-compounds, trace elements, and micronutrients. 

===Background===
Soil remineralization (in the sense of re-incorporating minerals, different from remineralisation in biogeochemistry) creates fertile soils by returning minerals to the soil which have been lost by erosion, leaching, and or over-farming. It functions the same way that the Earth does: during an Ice Age, glaciers crush rock onto the Earth&#x27;s soil mantle, and winds blow the dust in the form of loess all over the globe. Volcanoes erupt, spewing forth minerals from deep within the Earth, and rushing rivers form mineral-rich alluvial deposits.

Rock dust is added to soil to improve fertility and has been tested since 1993 at the Sustainable Ecological Earth Regeneration Centre (SEER Centre) in Straloch, near Pitlochry, in Perth and Kinross, Scotland. Further testing has been undertaken by James Cook University, Townsville, Far North Queensland.

=== History ===

Thomas J. Goreau who wrote the book &quot;Geotherapy&quot; believed that mafic/ultra-mafic rock flour had a powerful effect in restoring trace minerals to soils, which increases the health and vigour of the Microorganism, Plantae, Animalia pathway and also sequesters carbon. An early experimenter was the German miller, Julius Hensel, author of &quot;Bread from Stones&quot;, who reported successful results with &quot;steinmehl&quot; (stonemeal) in the 1890s. His ideas were not taken up due to technical limitations and, according to proponents of his method, because of opposition from the champions of conventional fertilisers.

John D. Hamaker argued that widespread remineralization of soils with rock dust would be necessary to reverse soil depletion by current agriculture and forestry practice.

While this originally was an alternative concept, increasing mainstream research has been devoted to soil amendment and other benefits of rock flour application: for instance, a pilot project on the use of glacial rock, granite and basaltic fines by the U.S. Department of Agriculture exists at the Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. The SEER Centre in Scotland is a leading source of information on the use of rock dusts and mineral fines. The Soil Remineralization Forum was established with sponsorship from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and has commissioned a portfolio of research into the benefits of using mineral fines. The Forum provides an interface among research, environmentalists, and industry.

===Research===

SEER&#x27;s research claims that the benefits of adding rockdust to soil include increased moisture-holding properties in the soil, improved cation exchange capacity and better soil structure and drainage. Rockdust also provides calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium, plus trace elements and micronutrients. By replacing these leached minerals it is claimed that soil health is increased and that this produces healthier plants.

A 2022 study found that basalt dust improved soil fertility and increased available phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium levels compared to soil without the basalt dust in a period of several months.

Greenland rock flour increased yields from corn fields in Ghana and barley fields by 30-50%. Melting ice is depositing one billion tons of rock flour annually; one ton can direct air capture of carbon.

=== Composition ===
Silicon is thought to be the major element effecting the strength of cell wall development. However it is the amount of available silica that has a dramatic effect on the plant strength and subsequent health. To highlight this, plants that are grown in very sandy soils, (being high in non available silica), often require a silica based fertiliser to provide available silicon. Silicon comes in silicon multi-oxide molecules (e.g. SiO2, SiO4, SiO6, and SiO8). Each molecule shape is thought to pack in different ways to allow different levels of availability.

Often phosphorus is locked in soils due to many years of application of traditional fertilisers. The use of micronutrient-rich fertiliser enables plants to access locked phosphorus.

The elements high in available 2+ valence electrons, calcium, iron and magnesium in particular contribute to paramagnetism in soil which aid in cation exchange capacity.

The calcium and magnesium in high quality have the ability to neutralise pH in soils, in effect acting as a liming agent.

===Application===
Rock dust can be applied to soil by hand application, via broadcast spreader or by fertigation. Where possible the rockdust can be worked into the ground either physically or by using water to wash in.

In some soils which display poor levels of nutrients, application rates of 10 tonnes per hectare are required. In Australia, namely the Riverland, Riverina, Langhorne Creek, Barossa and McLaren Vale regions, rates are 3–5 tonnes per hectare. In a garden application, this might equate to 400 grams per square metre.

<text>In chemistry, racemization is a conversion, by heat or by chemical reaction, of an optically active compound into a racemic (optically inactive) form. This creates a 1:1 molar ratio of enantiomers and is referred to as a racemic mixture (i.e. contain equal amount of (+) and (−) forms). Plus and minus forms are called Dextrorotation and levorotation. The D and L enantiomers are present in equal quantities, the resulting sample is described as a racemic mixture or a racemate. Racemization can proceed through a number of different mechanisms, and it has particular significance in pharmacology inasmuch as different enantiomers may have different pharmaceutical effects.

== Stereochemistry ==

Chiral molecules have two forms (at each point of asymmetry), which differ in their optical characteristics: The &quot;levorotatory form&quot; (the &quot;(−)-form&quot;) will rotate counter-clockwise on the plane of polarization of a beam of light, whereas the &quot;dextrorotatory&quot; form (the &quot;(+)-form&quot;) will rotate clockwise on the plane of polarization of a beam of light. The two forms, which are non-superposable when rotated in 3-dimensional space, are said to be &quot;enantiomers&quot;. The notation is not to be confused with and naming of molecules which refers to the similarity in structure to -glyceraldehyde and -glyceraldehyde. Also, (&quot;R&quot;)- and (&quot;S&quot;)- refer to the chemical structure of the molecule based on Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules of naming rather than rotation of light. R/S notation is the primary notation used for +/- now because D and L notation are used primarily for sugars and amino acids.

Racemization occurs when one pure form of an enantiomer is converted into equal proportion of both enantiomers, forming a racemate. When there are both equal numbers of dextrorotating and levorotating molecules, the net optical rotation of a racemate is zero. Enantiomers should also be distinguished from diastereomers which are a type of stereoisomer that have different molecular structures around a stereocenter and are not mirror images.

Partial to complete racemization of stereochemistry in solutions are a result of SN1 mechanisms. However, when complete inversion of stereochemistry configuration occurs in a substitution reaction, an SN2 reaction is responsible.

== Physical properties ==
In the solid state, racemic mixtures may have different physical properties from either of the pure enantiomers because of the differential intermolecular interactions (see Biological Significance section). The change from a pure enantiomer to a racemate can change its density, melting point, solubility, heat of fusion, refractive index, and its various spectra. Crystallization of a racemate can result in separate (+) and (−) forms, or a single racemic compound. However, in liquid and gaseous states, racemic mixtures will behave with physical properties that are identical, or near identical, to their pure enantiomers.

== Biological significance ==
In general, most biochemical reactions are stereoselective, so only one stereoisomer will produce the intended product while the other simply does not participate or can cause side-effects. Of note, the form of amino acids and the form of sugars (primarily glucose) are usually the biologically reactive form. This is due to the fact that many biological molecules are chiral and thus the reactions between specific enantiomers produce pure stereoisomers. Also notable is the fact that all amino acid residues exist in the form. However, bacteria produce -amino acid residues that polymerize into short polypeptides which can be found in bacterial cell walls. These polypeptides are less digestible by peptidases and are synthesized by bacterial enzymes instead of mRNA translation which would normally produce -amino acids.

The stereoselective nature of most biochemical reactions meant that different enantiomers of a chemical may have different properties and effects on a person. Many psychotropic drugs show differing activity or efficacy between isomers, e.g. amphetamine is often dispensed as racemic salts while the more active dextroamphetamine is reserved for refractory cases or more severe indications; another example is methadone, of which one isomer has activity as an opioid agonist and the other as an NMDA antagonist.

Racemization of pharmaceutical drugs can occur &quot;in vivo&quot;. Thalidomide as the (&quot;R&quot;) enantiomer is effective against morning sickness, while the (&quot;S&quot;) enantiomer is teratogenic, causing birth defects when taken in the first trimester of pregnancy. If only one enantiomer is administered to a human subject, both forms may be found later in the blood serum. The drug is therefore not considered safe for use by women of child-bearing age, and while it has other uses, its use is tightly controlled. Thalidomide can be used to treat multiple myeloma.

Another commonly used drug is ibuprofen which is only anti-inflammatory as one enantiomer while the other is biologically inert. Likewise, the (&quot;S&quot;) stereoisomer is much more reactive than the (&quot;R&quot;) enantiomer in citalopram (Celexa), an antidepressant which inhibits serotonin reuptake, is active. The configurational stability of a drug is therefore an area of interest in pharmaceutical research. The production and analysis of enantiomers in the pharmaceutical industry is studied in the field of chiral organic synthesis.

== Formation of racemic mixtures ==
Racemization can be achieved by simply mixing equal quantities of two pure enantiomers. Racemization can also occur in a chemical interconversion. For example, when (&quot;R&quot;)-3-phenyl-2-butanone is dissolved in aqueous ethanol that contains NaOH or HCl, a racemate is formed. The racemization occurs by way of an intermediate enol form in which the former stereocenter becomes planar and hence achiral. An incoming group can approach from either side of the plane, so there is an equal probability that protonation back to the chiral ketone will produce either an &quot;R&quot; or an &quot;S&quot; form, resulting in a racemate.

Racemization can occur through some of the following processes:
* Substitution reactions that proceed through a free carbocation intermediate, such as unimolecular substitution reactions, lead to non-stereospecific addition of substituents which results in racemization. 
* Although unimolecular elimination reactions also proceed through a carbocation, they do not result in a chiral center. They result instead in a set of geometric isomers in which &quot;trans&quot;/&quot;cis&quot; (&quot;E&quot;/&quot;Z&quot;) forms are produced, rather than racemates.
* In a unimolecular aliphatic electrophilic substitution reaction, if the carbanion is planar or if it cannot maintain a pyramidal structure, then racemization should occur, though not always. 
* In a free radical substitution reaction, if the formation of the free radical takes place at a chiral carbon, then racemization is almost always observed.

The rate of racemization (from -forms to a mixture of -forms and -forms) has been used as a way of dating biological samples in tissues with slow rates of turnover, forensic samples, and fossils in geological deposits. This technique is known as amino acid dating.

== Discovery of optical activity ==
In 1843, Louis Pasteur discovered optical activity in paratartaric, or racemic, acid found in grape wine. He was able to separate two enantiomer crystals that rotated polarized light in opposite directions.

<text>British Forces Germany (&quot;BFG&quot;) was the generic name for the three services of the British Armed Forces, made up of service personnel, UK Civil Servants, and dependents (family members), based in Germany. It was established following the Second World War, the largest parts of it becoming known as the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) and RAF Germany (RAFG). Both components had the mission of defending West Germany and remained there for the rest of the Cold War.

It was the largest concentration of British armed forces permanently stationed outside the United Kingdom. With the end of the Cold War, and the Options for Change defence review in the early 1990s, BFG as a whole was considerably reduced, with the British presence centred on the 1st Armoured Division, and supporting elements.

Following the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the permanent deployment in Germany ended in 2020. This was after British forces personnel were scaled down over several years, with 19,100 in April 2010, and 2,850 in April 2019. However, around 185 British Army personnel and 60 Ministry of Defence civilians will stay in Germany beyond 2020.

The remaining presence in Germany is known as British Army Germany.

==History==


First established following the Second World War, the forces grew during the Cold War, and consisted, by the early 1980s, of I (BR) Corps made up of four divisions; 1st Armoured Division, 2nd Armoured Division, 3rd Armoured Division and the 4th Armoured Division.

Disbandment of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) and Royal Air Force Germany (RAFG) in 1994, following the end of the Cold War and the Options for Change defence review in the early 1990s, reduced the strength of the British Armed Forces in Germany by almost 30,000 with just one division (1st Armoured) remaining by the late 1990s, concentrated in North Rhine-Westphalia. The British presence was estimated to have been contributing 1.5 billion euros annually to the German economy in 2004. Following a further spending review, one brigade was withdrawn and Osnabrück Garrison closed in 2009.

Administrative support for British service personnel in Germany and across continental Europe was delegated to United Kingdom Support Command (Germany), (UKSC(G)). The four Army garrisons in Germany were under the direct administrative control of UKSC(G). The General Officer Commanding UKSC(G) also functioned as head of the British Forces Liaison Organisation (Germany), which was responsible for liaising and maintaining relations with German civil authorities.

Under the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, it was decided that British military units would cease to be permanently deployed in Germany by the end of 2019. This led to a scaling down of the British military presence, and a restructuring of command and support structures.

HQ British Forces Germany was formed in January 2012, replacing the UKSC(G) and the Germany Support Group (GSG). Rhine Garrison, which principally comprised HQ British Forces Germany in the Rheindahlen Military Complex and Elmpt Station (formerly RAF Bruggen), also reduced in size; the HQ moved to Bielefeld in July 2013 and other units returned to the UK. The two central garrisons - Gütersloh and Paderborn - combined to form a single &#x27;super garrison&#x27; called Westfalen Garrison in April 2014.

With the departure of Major General John Henderson in March 2015, the Commanding Officer of British Forces Germany became a brigadier&#x27;s post, with Brigadier Ian Bell assuming command.

In autumn 2019, British Forces Germany effectively closed, with the last military base handed back to the German Bundeswehr in February 2020. However, some training will still be undertaken in Germany with regard to NATO capability.

==Off-duty life==
The British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) services were widely available on FM across north-western Germany.

The British Army Germany rugby union team regularly played games against emerging rugby nations like Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg.

During the height of &quot;the Troubles&quot; in Northern Ireland, the IRA targeted personnel in Germany between 1988 and 1990. The attacks resulted in the deaths of nine people, including three civilians, and many wounded. As a result, vehicles owned by personnel ceased to have distinct registration plates, which had made them easily identifiable.

<text>USS &quot;Sellers&quot; (DDG-11) was a &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class guided-missile destroyer built for the United States Navy in the 1950s.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Charles F. Addams&quot; class was based on a stretched hull modified to accommodate smaller RIM-24 Tartar surface-to-air missiles and all their associated equipment. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draft of . They displaced at full load. Their crew consisted of 18 officers and 320 enlisted men.

The ships were equipped with two geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were intended to produce to reach the designed speed of . The &quot;Adams&quot; class had a range of at a speed of .

The &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class ships were armed with two 5&quot;/54 caliber Mark 42 guns, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. They were fitted with an eight-round ASROC launcher between the funnels. Close-range anti-submarine defense was provided by two triple sets of Mk 32 torpedo tubes. The primary armament of the ships was the Tartar surface-to-air missile designed to defend the carrier battle group. They were fired via the dual-arm Mk 11 missile launcher and the ships stowed a total of 42 missiles for the launcher.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Sellers&quot;, named for Admiral David F. Sellers, was laid down by the Bath Iron Works at Bath in Maine on 3 August 1959, launched on 9 September 1960 by Mrs. Hugh Scott and commissioned on 28 October 1961. &quot;Sellers&quot; was decommissioned on 31 October 1989, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 November 1992 and sold on 25 July 1995.

As of 2005, no other U.S. Navy ship has been named &quot;Sellers&quot;.

<text>Ground Force is a British garden makeover television series originally broadcast by the BBC between 1997 and 2005. The series was originally hosted by Alan Titchmarsh, Charlie Dimmock and Tommy Walsh.

==Production==
The series was created by Peter Bazalgette and was first broadcast on 19 September 1997 on BBC Two. In each episode, a team of gardeners make over the garden of an individual who has been nominated by a member of their family or a friend. Whilst that individual is away, the team, assisted by friends and family, make over the garden over two days, and surprise the individual on their return. The team was led by Alan Titchmarsh, presenter of &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot; and &quot;Gardeners&#x27; World&quot;, gardener Charlie Dimmock, builder Tommy Walsh and his assistant Will Shanahan. Dimmock met the producer–director of the series five years previously when she built a pond for the Meridian series &quot;Grass Roots&quot;. Walsh was invited to take part after completing work on the executive producer&#x27;s garden.

The series moved to BBC One for the second series. Titchmarsh left in 2002. Kirsty King joined the team after Titchmarsh left.

A number of new five-minute segments were filmed for Ground Force Revisited and appended onto repeats of earlier episodes, where Dimmock and Walsh revisited the garden concerned to surprise the owners and see how the gardens had developed.

The series was credited with helping the increase in sales of garden decking in the late 1990s and early 2000s due to its use during the series. Retailer B&amp;Q had sales rise from £5,000 in 1997 to £16 million in 2001.

The series was cancelled in 2005. Describing its cancellation, BBC Director-General Mark Thompson said that the series was &quot;reaching the end of its natural life&quot; and that &quot;the public do get very cross when they see the BBC flogging a dead horse&quot;.

At its peak, the series attracted 12 million viewers. Repeats of &quot;Ground Force&quot; are currently shown on Home.

==Music==
The theme music for the series was performed by the Black Dyke Band, and included the following pieces:
* &quot;Ground Force Theme&quot; — played during the show&#x27;s opening and closing.
* &quot;The Titchmarsh Warbler&quot; — a fast tempo piece usually played during the rush to complete the garden.
* &quot;Lament of the Dandelion&quot; — played near the end of the show as Titchmarsh surveyed the completed garden.

==Specials==

The team worked on a number of other special projects, including:
* a garden in memory of TV presenter Jill Dando in her home town of Weston-super-Mare
* the New York Restoration Project garden near Ground Zero in New York, for singer Bette Midler
* an Old Servicemen&#x27;s Home garden in Jamaica
* a Children&#x27;s Home garden in New Delhi, India
* the home of former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela
The Ground Force team&#x27;s final episode was aired in July 2005. It took place in the forecourt of the British Museum in London, where the team designed and created the Africa Garden as part of the Africa 05 celebration, the biggest celebration of African culture organised in the UK. The design of the garden features temperate, tropical and desert zones.

==International versions==
A New Zealand version of &quot;Ground Force&quot; aired on TV One from 1998 to 2003. It was titled Firth Ground Force, named after a local concrete and masonry company.

In 2000, the producers sought legal advice after accusing the Nine Network in Australia of producing a &quot;carbon copy&quot; of &quot;Ground Force&quot; entitled &quot;Backyard Blitz&quot;. A legitimate Australian version of Ground Force was already in production, and aired shortly after on the Seven Network. While this version of Ground Force was short lived, Backyard Blitz continued on until 2007.

Ground Force America is the American version, presented by Dimmock and Walsh. It began airing in 2003 on BBC America, and it was the channel&#x27;s first original production. The channel had been airing the UK version since 1999.

==&quot;Top Gear and Ground Force Crossover 2008&quot;==
On 14 March 2008, &quot;Top Gear&quot; &quot;resurrected&quot; Ground Force in a Sport Relief special called Top Ground Gear Force where the presenters of &quot;Top Gear&quot; conducted a Ground Force style show on Sir Steve Redgrave&#x27;s garden, who was livid at the intrusion.

==Transmissions==
===Original series===
A total of 97 episodes of Ground Force were produced and shown (82 episodes comprising series 1–12 plus 15 specials), as well as an additional 12 episodes that make up Ground Force America:

<text>NAIA independent schools are four-year institutional members of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) that do not have formal conference affiliations. NAIA schools that are not members of any other athletic conference are members of the Continental Athletic Conference (CAC), formerly the Association of Independent Institutions (AII), which provides member services to the institution and allows members to compete in postseason competition. The CAC has one member institution in Canada&#x27;s British Columbia. It provides services to the member institutions that are not fitting in any other NAIA conference and allows members to compete in postseason competition. The AII renamed itself the Continental Athletic Conference at the end of June 2021, citing the need to identify as a proper conference.

<doc id="518810" wikidata="Q1777553" url="?curid=518810" title="Spirit (band)">
<text>Spirit was an American rock band founded in 1967 and based in Los Angeles. Their most commercially successful single in the United States was &quot;I Got a Line on You&quot;. They were also known for their albums, including their self-titled debut album, &quot;The Family That Plays Together&quot;, &quot;Clear&quot;, and &quot;Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus&quot;.

== Original lineup ==
The original lineup of the group evolved from a Los Angeles band, the Red Roosters, which included Randy California (born Randy Craig Wolfe; guitars, vocals), Mark Andes (bass) and Jay Ferguson (vocals, percussion). With the addition of California&#x27;s stepfather Ed Cassidy on drums, and keyboard player John Locke, the new band was originally named the &quot;Spirits Rebellious&quot; (after a book by Kahlil Gibran), but the name was soon shortened to Spirit. Before returning to his native state, California previously played with Jimi Hendrix as a member of Jimmy James and the Blue Flames in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village in 1966. Hendrix gave Randy Wolfe the nickname &quot;Randy California&quot; to distinguish him from Randy Palmer, whom Hendrix named &quot;Randy Texas&quot;.

Cassidy was recognizable by his shaved head (hence his nickname &quot;Mr. Skin&quot;, later the title of a Spirit song) and his fondness for wearing black. Born in 1923, he was about twenty years older than the rest of the group. Although his earlier career was primarily in jazz (including stints with Cannonball Adderley, Gerry Mulligan, Roland Kirk, Thelonious Monk and Lee Konitz), he had served as the founding drummer of Rising Sons, an early blues rock vehicle for Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder.

== 1960s ==
Early demo recordings by the band were produced by their Topanga Canyon roommate Barry Hansen, later known as the radio host Dr. Demento. In August 1967, the record producer Lou Adler (known for his work with The Mamas &amp; the Papas and The Grass Roots) signed the band to his label, Ode Records. The group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Spirit&quot;, was released in 1968. &quot;Mechanical World&quot; was released as a single (it lists the playing time merely as &quot;very long&quot;). The album was a hit, reaching number 31 on the Billboard 200 and staying on the chart for seven months. The album had jazz influences and used elaborate string arrangements (not found on their subsequent recordings) and is the most overtly psychedelic of their albums. A song from the album, &quot;Fresh Garbage&quot;, was included on the CBS sampler album &quot;The Rock Machine Turns You On&quot;, released in 1968 in the UK, Europe and South Africa, and was the UK&#x27;s first introduction to the band.

The band capitalized on the success of their first album with another single, &quot;I Got a Line on You&quot;. Released in November 1968, a month before their second album, &quot;The Family That Plays Together&quot;, it became their biggest hit single, reaching number 25 on the charts (number 28 in Canada). The album matched its success, reaching number 22. In December, they appeared at the Denver Auditorium, with support band Led Zeppelin, who soon after interpolated parts of Spirit&#x27;s song &quot;Fresh Garbage&quot; in an extended medley based around their cover of Bob Elgin and Jerry Ragavoy&#x27;s &quot;As Long as I Have You&quot; (initially popularized by Garnet Mimms) during their early 1969 concerts. Spirit also appeared with Led Zeppelin at two outdoor music festivals in July 1969. Jimmy Page&#x27;s use of a theremin has been attributed to his seeing Randy California use one that he had mounted to his amplifier. &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine stated that &quot;California&#x27;s most enduring legacy may well be the fingerpicked acoustic theme of the song &#x27;Taurus&#x27;, which Jimmy Page was accused of copying note for note for the introduction to &#x27;Stairway to Heaven&#x27;.&quot; &quot;The Independent&quot; noted the similarity in 1997. In 2014, Mark Andes and a trust acting on behalf of Randy California filed a copyright infringement suit against Led Zeppelin in an attempt to obtain a writing credit for &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. Page denied copying &quot;Taurus&quot;, and the suit was unsuccessful. The verdict was overturned on appeal in September 2018. On March 9, 2020, the Ninth Circuit re-instated the original jury verdict.

After the success of their early records, the group was asked by French film director Jacques Demy to record the soundtrack to his film &quot;Model Shop&quot;, and they also made a brief appearance in the film. Their third album, &quot;Clear&quot;, released in 1969, reached No. 55 on the charts.

== &quot;1984&quot; and the &quot;Sardonicus&quot; era ==

In late 1969, Lou Adler moved distribution of his record label, Ode Records, from Columbia Records to A&amp;M Records. As part of the termination agreement, Columbia was allowed to keep the group under contract. Further releases would be shifted to the Epic Records label.

After the release of &quot;Clear&quot;, the group recorded the song &quot;1984&quot;, written by California and produced by the group on their own. After being released in February 1970, it placed at No. 69 on the Billboard charts and No. 66 on the RPM charts. The song would finally see general release on &quot;The Best of Spirit&quot; in 1973. The song was later covered by Nash the Slash on his 1984 album &quot;American Band-ages&quot;.

In 1970, Spirit started working on their fourth LP &quot;Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus&quot;. The band chose frequent Neil Young collaborator David Briggs as the producer at the recommendation of the singer-songwriter, an acquaintance from the Topanga Canyon scene. It was a prolific time for the group&#x27;s writers, and the album was released in late 1970, peaking at No. 63 in early 1971 in the USA, and No. 49 in Canada. The album included Randy California&#x27;s &quot;Nature&#x27;s Way&quot;, a minor hit (No. 111) which was written in an afternoon during an engagement at the Fillmore West in San Francisco.

Epic also released an early mix of &quot;Animal Zoo&quot; as a single, but it too only made it to No. 97 on the charts. Like The Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot; and Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, &quot;Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus&quot; is critically regarded as a landmark of art rock, with a tapestry of literary themes about the fragility of life and the complexity of the human experience, illustrated by recurring lyric &quot;life has just begun&quot;, and continued the group&#x27;s pioneering exploration of environmental issues in their lyrics (cf. &quot;Fresh Garbage&quot;). The album is also notable for its inventive production and the use of a modular Moog synthesizer.

== 1971–73 ==
After the group undertook a promotional tour to support the album &quot;Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus&quot;, Ferguson and Andes left the group, forming Jo Jo Gunne. California had accused them of plotting to take over the group. Their final gig with Spirit occurred on January 30, 1971, which almost ended with a fist-fight.

John Arliss initially took Andes&#x27; place. California was still in the lineup, but he had suffered a head injury from a horse riding accident and was unable to tour. Shortly thereafter, bassist and recent University of Texas School of Law graduate Al Staehely was recruited by Locke and Cassidy to replace Arliss. The trio toured briefly before deciding that they had to add a guitarist to do the music justice. Al&#x27;s brother, John Christian (Chris) Staehely, auditioned for the band and was quickly brought on board, departing the Texas rock group Krackerjack.

The Staehelys, Cassidy and Locke recorded the 1972 album &quot;Feedback&quot; in Columbia/Epic&#x27;s Hollywood studios. It was a different turn for the group, showing more of a country rock influence pervading their jazzier tendencies, but it met with only a mild commercial response, also reaching No. 63 in the charts. While the tour for &quot;Feedback&quot; proceeded very well for much of that year, Cassidy and Locke lacked an affinity for roots-based music and soon left the lineup. The Staehely brothers completed the critically successful tour with drummer Stu Perry before dissolving the group in mid-1973 and releasing their own album, &quot;Sta-Hay-Lee&quot;.

California, meanwhile, had recorded and issued his first solo album, &quot;Kapt. Kopter and the (Fabulous) Twirly Birds&quot;, also on Epic Records in late 1972. Featuring appearances by Noel Redding (as &quot;Clit McTorius&quot;), Leslie Sampson (the drummer from Redding&#x27;s band Road; as &quot;Henry Manchovitz&quot;), and Cassidy, the album had a hard rock sound. Following a brief tour in support of the album in the Los Angeles area with Cassidy and bassist Larry &quot;Fuzzy&quot; Knight, California toured Europe with this trio under the imprimatur of Spirit amid pressure from booking agents who wanted to capitalize on the band&#x27;s name and were not interested in his solo work. During this period, a follow-up album (&quot;The Adventures Of Kaptain Kopter And Commander Cassidy In Potato Land&quot;) also was recorded with Cassidy. Although Locke made a guest appearance, it was not intended as a Spirit album at the time. California moved to Molokai, Hawaii, after Epic rejected the completed album.

In 1973, Epic Records decided to re-issue the group&#x27;s first and third albums as a two-fer entitled &quot;Spirit&quot; in response to &quot;Sardonicus&quot; continuing to sell well as a catalog item; eventually, &quot;Sardonicus&quot; earned the band&#x27;s only RIAA gold certification in 1976. That same year, Epic issued &quot;The Best of Spirit&quot; compilation album alongside the &quot;Sardonicus&quot; track &quot;Mr. Skin&quot; as a single. &quot;Mr. Skin&quot; became another minor hit (peaking at No. 92), and the two-fer also hit the charts along with &quot;The Best of Spirit&quot;. Cassidy decided to capitalize on the new demand for the group and put together an entirely new group for touring purposes, which lasted throughout the year.

== The Mercury years (1974–79) ==
In 1974, Cassidy made it a point to find and re-establish contact with his stepson. He eventually persuaded California to return to the mainland and give the band another shot. Andes worked with the duo for a while, but never intended to stay, as he was in the process of forming the group Firefall at the same time. Andes was replaced by former Frank Zappa sound engineer Barry Keene.

In early 1975, the group was scheduled to open for Ten Years After at a show in Florida, but when the headlining band backed out at the last minute, Spirit was granted permission to take over the theater for the evening. After going around to local radio stations to promote the show and setting a low ($3) ticket price, Spirit managed to sell out the 3,000-seat theater. Using the profits from the show, they blocked out as much time as they could at Studio 70 in Tampa, Florida.

After recording a large amount of material at the studio, manager Marshall Berle (the nephew of Milton Berle) offered the cache of tapes to Mercury Records. On the basis of the material, the group was offered a contract, and a double album entitled &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot; was culled from the material and released in May 1975. The album peaked at No. 147 and garnered some FM airplay, so they quickly followed it up with &quot;Son of Spirit&quot;, released later that year and featuring many songs taken from the same sessions.

For the tour in support of &quot;Son of Spirit&quot;, Locke re-joined the group. Eventually, Andes returned to the lineup as well, and although Ferguson declined to participate in the group reunion at first, the band (with the addition of Mark&#x27;s brother Matt Andes as a second guitarist) recorded an album entitled &quot;Farther Along&quot;, released in late 1976.

=== First full reunion and &quot;Future Games&quot; ===
For a few shows at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, Ferguson re-joined the group. Neil Young created an incident during the final show&#x27;s encore of &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; when he walked on stage inebriated. California would later claim that he did not recognize Young, but at the time was angry with Young for upstaging what he saw as his own comeback. California moved over in front of Neil and began pushing him backwards, away from the microphone, back past the drumkit and offstage. Young, along with other influential artists including New Hollywood director Hal Ashby, had been visiting the band backstage before they went on, and Locke (a friend of Young) had invited the guitarist to join them in their encore. When Locke saw California pushing Young offstage, he got up from his piano and said that he had had enough and did not ever want to play with California again, walking off stage. Cassidy initially quelled the situation by leaving his kit and physically pulling both California and Young back onstage to the microphone to close out the song, asking the audience to sing along with them. After finishing the song, the band members argued backstage over what had unfolded leading to the end of the reunion.

Afterwards, California assembled &quot;Future Games: A Magical Kahauna Dream&quot; with Cassidy and limited assistance from session musicians. The experimental album included a Hendrix-influenced cover of &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; and underpinned science fiction-based lyrical themes with many samples from &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; in a variant of filk. Although Mercury approved its release in early 1977, it received no promotion and peaked at No. 179 on the U.S. charts, ending what little commercial momentum the group might have regained. It also (initially) ended their contract with Mercury. During this period, Ferguson was having success in his solo career with the hits &quot;Thunder Island&quot; (1977; No. 9) and &quot;Shakedown Cruise&quot; (1979; No. 31).

=== Return to trio ===
In a reprise of the &quot;Kapt. Kopter&quot;-era trio, California, Cassidy and Larry &quot;Fuzzy&quot; Knight toured extensively as Spirit throughout 1978; an English leg saw the band headline a triple bill that included post-punk ensemble Alternative TV and The Police. Throughout the tour, California doubled on the foot-controlled Moog Taurus to partially compensate for the lack of a keyboardist. The German TV/radio programme Rockpalast recorded and broadcast Spirit&#x27;s entire show of March 4/5, 1978, including the encore jam where Dickey Betts joined the band. This trio lineup also recorded a heavily-overdubbed live album (also released in 1978) that was released in slightly different configurations in several countries by different independent labels. It was not a commercial success, and after the tour&#x27;s end in 1979, California left the group again.

== The 1980s and beyond ==

After Spirit&#x27;s demise, California put together another group with the short-lived intent of restarting his solo career. While in England, a fan presented him with a petition of 5,000 signatures requesting the release of the &quot;Potato Land&quot; album from 1973. Consequently, in 1981, California released an overdubbed selection of tracks from the original album alongside several unrelated songs dating from the late 1970s. Contrary to the intention of the original sessions, it was released under the imprimatur of Spirit in the United States by Rhino Records (a nascent archival label with ties to Dr. Demento) and in Britain by Beggars Banquet Records, a well-regarded independent label specializing in punk rock and its derivations. Surprisingly, it was the only Spirit album other than &quot;Sardonicus&quot; to chart in Britain, peaking at No. 40 in the UK Albums Chart and receiving airplay on BBC Radio 1.

On February 14, 1982, Spirit, performed as a three-piece band, Randy California, Ed Cassidy and an unknown bass player, at Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis, MO. The show was sponsored and heavily promoted by local rock radio station K-SHE 95 and billed as; &quot;K-SHE 95 presents the 5th Annual St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre,&quot; JOHN KAY &amp; STEPPENWOLF, w/special guests; SPIRIT. The show was a near sell out with a little over 8,000 in attendance. California&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Euro-American&quot;, was released in 1982 by Beggars Banquet. It featured a lineup including drummer Preston Heyman. During this period, California performed on the second tier at the 1982 Glastonbury Festival. When the power generator failed—allegedly because the operator had fallen asleep stoned and neglected to refill the fuel—Heyman performed a twenty-minute solo while the situation was rectified.

In December 1982, the original Spirit lineup re-formed and recorded several songs from their first four albums (as well as a few new tracks) live on a soundstage. The band was joined by several guests, including Jeff Baxter and Bob Welch. The resulting &quot;Spirit of &#x27;84&quot; (released internationally as &quot;The Thirteenth Dream&quot;) was initially recorded for an audiophile label; however, Mercury Records re-signed the band (including a California solo deal) and released the album in 1984. The album was only a moderate critical success and failed to chart. While some of the original members went on to do other projects, California and Cassidy continued touring with new members Scott Monahan on keyboards and Dave Waterbury on bass.

California headed to England and recorded his third solo album, the contemporary hard rock effort &quot;Restless&quot;, for which Heyman (who played on the track &quot;Jack Rabbit&quot;) secured a deal with Phonogram for in late 1985. Following a few live dates in England, California returned to the United States and resumed touring extensively with Cassidy, Monahan, and Waterbury. There was one more solo album from California: a collection of material entitled &quot;Shattered Dreams&quot; that was released in 1986.

In 1988, California secured a deal for Spirit with prominent independent label I.R.S. Records (best known for cultivating R.E.M. and The Go-Go&#x27;s), leading Locke to rejoin the band. They recorded an album entitled &quot;Rapture in the Chambers&quot; at the Malibu, California, recording studio Nileland, where studio owner/engineer, bassist and vocalist Mike Nile was asked to join the band. Although the group (including California, Cassidy, Locke, Nile, Monahan, and George Valuck on keyboards) toured extensively in support, the album failed to chart. California, Cassidy, and Nile continued to tour as a power trio while self-releasing &quot;Tent of Miracles&quot; in 1990. Nile contributed heavily to the album, writing songs and sharing lead vocals.

Spirit continued working almost continually for the next six years. Although they only released one album after &quot;Tent of Miracles&quot;, the group was always either recording or touring. California had his own home recording studio since the early 1980s, though he had been making home recordings for years prior to that. This came to an end on January 2, 1997, when California drowned off the coast of Hawaii. He had been surfing with his son, who got caught in a riptide. He managed to push his son to safety but ended up losing his own life.

While Cassidy played a few dates with Spirit alumni under the name &quot;Spirit Revisited&quot; in 1998, California&#x27;s death was effectively the end of the group. Locke died of complications resulting from lymphoma in August 2006. Cassidy died on December 6, 2012, in San Jose, California, at age 89.

== Posthumous ==
California&#x27;s death, however, did not mark the end of the emergence of Spirit material. Starting in 2000, there have been five collections of previously unreleased studio and live material, four of which were two-CD sets. California had also prepared an anthology of material from the group&#x27;s first stint with Mercury Records entitled &quot;The Mercury Years&quot;. The two-CD set was released in early 1997, though it raised the ire of some fans who did not care for the fact that some of the material had been re-edited or featured overdubbing that was not present on the original releases.

Likewise, nearly all of Spirit&#x27;s original albums are currently in print on CD. This is thanks to the efforts of Sony Music (with the Epic catalog, though Collector&#x27;s Choice Music was the first to reissue &quot;Feedback&quot; on CD in the U.S., following a brief release on disc in France in the late 1990s) and Beat Goes On alongside Edsel, both UK labels (with the Mercury catalog, some of which had made it to CD prior to Beat Goes On and Edsel reissuing all of their Mercury albums). Their later independent albums are available through the group&#x27;s website. The one album that is unavailable at this time is &quot;Rapture In The Chambers&quot;, which has not been reissued since the original 1989 release, though it was released on CD at that time.

Spirit has also found its work sampled by modern artists several times. The most notable of these was the &quot;Extra P. Remix&quot; of the song &quot;Resurrection&quot; by Common (which samples &quot;Ice&quot; from &quot;Clear)&quot; and &quot;Feel Good Time&quot; by Pink (which samples the track &quot;Fresh Garbage&quot;).

In 2015, &quot;I Got a Line On You&quot; was covered by Alice Cooper&#x27;s super group the Hollywood Vampires on the album of the same name.

== Musical style ==
According to &quot;AllMusic&quot;, Spirit was an &quot;ambitious and acclaimed West Coast psychedelic band that fused hard rock to jazz, blues, country, and folk&quot;; Formed by an eclectic group of musicians who had backgrounds in rock, pop, folk, blues, classical music and jazz backgrounds, Spirit &quot;had an eclectic musical style in keeping with the early days of progressive rock&quot; and they &quot;seemed determine to out-eclecticize everybody else on the California psychedelic scene, with [their] melange of rock, jazz, blues, folk-rock, and even a bit of classical and Indian music.&quot; Robert Christgau wrote that Randy California was &quot;the rock equivalent of the cool, progressive jazzman of the &#x27;50s&quot;.

<text>The Douglas DC-4 is an American four-engined (piston), propeller-driven airliner developed by the Douglas Aircraft Company. Military versions of the plane, the C-54 and R5D, served during World War II, in the Berlin Airlift and into the 1960s. From 1945, many civil airlines operated the DC-4 worldwide.

==Design and development==
Following proving flights by United Airlines of the DC-4E, it became obvious that the 52-seat airliner was too inefficient and unreliable to operate economically and the partner airlines, American Airlines, Eastern, Pan American, Trans World and United, recommended a lengthy list of changes to the design. Douglas took the new requirements and produced an entirely new, smaller design, the DC-4A, with a simpler, still unpressurized fuselage, Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2000 Twin Wasp engines, and a single fin and rudder. A tricycle landing gear was retained.

With the entry of the United States into World War II, in December 1941, the United States Army Air Forces took over the provisional orders for the airlines and allocated them the designation C-54 Skymaster. The first C-54 flew from Clover Field in Santa Monica, California, on 14 February 1942.


To meet military requirements, the first production aircraft had four additional auxiliary fuel tanks in the main cabin, which reduced the passenger seats to 26. The following batch of aircraft was the first built to military specifications, and was designated C-54A and built with a stronger floor and a cargo door with a hoist and winch. The first C-54A was delivered in February 1943. With the introduction of the C-54B in March 1944, the outer wings were changed to hold integral fuel tanks, allowing two of the cabin tanks to be removed; this allowed 49 seats (or 16 stretchers) to be fitted. The C-54C was a hybrid for Presidential use; it had a C-54A fuselage with four cabin fuel tanks and the C-54B wings with built-in tanks to achieve maximum range.

The most common variant was the C-54D, which entered service in August 1944, essentially a C-54B with more powerful R-2000-11 engines. With the C-54E the last two cabin fuel tanks were moved to the wings, which allowed more freight or 44 passenger seats.

In total, 1,163 C-54s (or R5D in US Navy service) were built for the United States military between 1942 and January 1946 and another 79 DC-4s were built after the war. A later variant, with more powerful Merlin engines allowing it to fly over 40% faster, was built in Canada as the Canadair North Star.

==Operational history==
The DC-4/C-54 proved to be a popular and reliable type, with 1,245 being built between May 1942 and August 1947, including 79 postwar DC-4s. Several remain in service as of 2022.

Douglas continued to develop the type during the war in preparation for a return to airline use when peace returned. Sales of new aircraft had to compete against 500 wartime ex-military C-54s and R5Ds which came onto the civilian market, many of which were converted to DC-4 standard by Douglas. DC-4s were a favorite of charter airlines such as Great Lakes Airlines, North American Airlines, Universal Airlines, and Transocean Airlines. In the 1950s, Transocean (Oakland, California) was the largest civilian C-54/DC-4 operator.


Douglas produced 79 new-build DC-4s between January 1946 and August 9, 1947, the last example being delivered to South African Airways. Pressurization was an option, but all civilian DC-4s (and C-54s) were built unpressurized.

A total of 330 DC-4s and C-54s were used in the Berlin Airlift, which made them one of the most numerous types involved.

Purchasers of new-build DC-4s included Pan American Airways, National Airlines, Northwest Airlines, and Western Airlines in the US, and KLM Royal Dutch Air Lines, Scandinavian Airlines System, Iberia Airlines of Spain, Swissair, Air France, Sabena Belgian World Airlines, Cubana de Aviación, Avianca, Aerolíneas Argentinas, Aeropostal of Venezuela (1946), and South African Airways overseas. Several airlines used new-build DC-4s to start scheduled transatlantic flights between Latin America and Europe. Among the earliest were Aerolíneas Argentinas (1946), Iberia Airlines of Spain (1946), and Cubana de Aviación (1948).

Basic prices for a new DC-4 in 1946–47 were around £140,000-. In 1960, used DC-4s were available for around .

, two DC-4s were used for charters in South Africa by the South African Airways Museum Society, with both aircraft (ZS-BMH and ZS-AUB) carrying historical South African Airways livery.

Buffalo Airways of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories continues to operate the type commercially.

Very few DC-4s remain in service today. 
*The last two passenger DC-4s operating worldwide are based in Johannesburg, South Africa. They fly with old South African Airways (SAA) livery. They are ZS-AUB &quot;Outeniqua&quot; and ZS-BMH &quot;Lebombo&quot; and are owned by the South African Airways Museum Society and operated by Skyclass Aviation, a company specialising in classic and VIP charters to exotic destinations in Africa.
*A 1944-built DC-4/C-54 is on display at Historical Aircraft Restoration Society in New South Wales, Australia, with a planned restoration to airworthiness. 
*A 1945-built DC-4 (C-54D) 43-17228 is being operated by Berlin Airlift Historical Foundation as a flying museum of the Berlin Airlift. Called the &quot;Spirit of Freedom&quot;, it replaced a previous C-54 (44-9144) damaged by a tornado in 2020. 
*One ex-Buffalo Airways DC-4 (N55CW c/n 10673, currently registered to Aircraft Guaranty Corp Trustee) is fitted with spray bars on top of the wings and is currently based in Florida on standby for oil pollution control.
*A 1945-built C-54 (C-54E-5-DO) c/n 27289, USAAF serial 44-9063, was recovered from Reconstruction Finance Corporation by Douglas aircraft for conversion to DC-4. It served with Pan American World Airways from 1946 to 1952 as NC-88887, then with a succession of carriers and private owners until retired in 1989 as N88887. Around 1990 it was placed on display at the Berlin Airlift Memorial at Frankfurt Airport.

<text>USS &quot;Robison&quot; (DDG-12), named for Rear Admiral Samuel Shelburne Robison, was a &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class guided missile armed destroyer in the service of the United States Navy.

== Construction and career ==
&quot;Robison&quot; was laid down by Defoe Shipbuilding Company in Bay City, Michigan on 28 April 1959, launched on 27 April 1960 by Mrs. John H. Sides, wife of the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, and commissioned on 9 December 1961 at the Boston Naval Shipyard.

=== 1960s ===
&quot;Robison&quot; served as plane guard for carriers on Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf, participated in Sea Dragon operations, patrolled on search and rescue duties and carried out Naval Gunfire Support missions during the Vietnam War.

&quot;Robison&quot; steamed for the west coast 29 January 1962 via the Panama Canal. On 1 March she received a message diverting her to Clipperton Island, to rescue 10 stranded seamen from the tuna boat &quot;Monarch&quot;, which had capsized 20 days earlier.

Arriving at San Diego on 7 March, &quot;Robison&quot; underwent shakedown and then post-shakedown availability 14 June in San Francisco. Fleet Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, who had twice served on Admiral Robison&#x27;s staff, visited the ship on 25 June.

Following completion of availability 31 July, &quot;Robison&quot; proceeded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard for ammunition, took on ASROC and Tartar missiles at Seal Beach, and then commenced 3 months of local training operations out of San Diego. She got underway with Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla 11 on 13 November for her first WestPac tour of duty. Upon completion of this deployment, &quot;Robison&quot; arrived San Diego 21 June 1963 for coastal operations.

She departed San Diego 18 November in company with for escort duties. Calling at Pearl Harbor 23 November, she departed 2 days later in company with . Upon detachment from &quot;Midway&quot;, she touched at Guam, and then escorted eastward. Following fueling stops at Midway Island and Pearl Harbor, she arrived San Diego 19 December.

In January 1964 &quot;Robison&quot; entered Long Beach Naval Shipyard for regular overhaul. After missile qualifications and refresher training, she steamed 14 August for her second WestPac deployment. Following her successful participation in modern naval warfare training exercises and calls at various Far Eastern ports, she departed Yokosuka 24 January 1965 and arrived San Diego 6 February.

Local spring operations were followed by a midshipman training cruise from 10 June to 5 August. The latter month also brought a call at Portland, Oreg., and a visit, on the 24th, by the Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. David L. McDonald. In the fall she sharpened her ASW, AAW, and shore bombardment techniques during coastal operations. Early in the new year 1966, the destroyer prepared for her third tour of duty in support of 7th Fleet operations in WestPac.

That deployment ended with her return to San Diego 18 July 1966. Overhaul in San Francisco took her through the fall and into the winter months, culminating in her return to homeport on 3 February 1967. Refresher and type training filled the next 5 months, and 25 July saw &quot;Robison&quot; once again en route to the Orient.

After calling at Pearl Harbor 31 July and Yokosuka, Japan, 5 August, she commenced Tonkin Gulf operations under the command of Thomas William McNamara on 25 August in the screen for . In naval gunfire support and &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; operations during the period from 26 August 1967 to 9 January 1968, &quot;Robison&quot; was credited with the destruction of 78 waterborne logistics craft. Her remarkable degree of combat readiness during this period earned for her the Meritorious Unit Commendation.

Upkeep, availability, training, and operating off the west coast maintained &quot;Robison&quot;&#x27;s state of readiness through the next 11 months. She steamed from San Diego for her fifth WestPac deployment on 30 December 1968 in company with carrier . The usual call at Pearl Harbor was followed by arrival at Subic Bay, 20 January 1969. After voyage repairs &quot;Robison&quot; joined Task Group 77.3 in Tonkin Gulf. The destroyer, flagship of her division, served in the screen of both &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and . She also provided naval gunfire support to troops ashore in the I Corps Zone.

&quot;Robison&quot; returned to San Diego on 6 July 1969, remaining there until 2 October, when she arrived at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard, Hunters Point, for overhaul. Work was completed 4½ months later, and &quot;Robison&quot; returned to her homeport of San Diego 27 February 1970, ready for refresher training and yet another WestPac deployment.

===1970–1980===
With the advent of 1970, Robison began a cycle of deployments which endured for three years. She spent the spring of each year on the west coast of the United States and then, in late spring or early summer, she deployed to WestPac. This cycle continued until 1973. During that year she remained on the west coast, engaged in normal operations out of San Diego, where she was berthed as of January 1974.

After fighting in Vietnam in the &#x27;60s, she participated in the rescue of two groups of Vietnamese refugees in 1980. The first group was spotted while doing maneuvers with the Thai Navy in the South China Sea. When the Robison arrived that evening only 262 people survived of the 300+ that disembarked from Vietnam to escape the horrors of their homeland. Many died during their ordeal in the sea or ended their lives after giving up hope before the Robison arrived. These refugees were &quot;housed&quot; under tarps on the gun deck of the Robison, cared for and nursed back to health by members of the crew until permission was granted to take them to Thailand to be processed and, eventually, taken to the United States. Within weeks of rescuing the first group, a second group was spotted with a very small contingent of people; 21 to be precise. The seas were stormy so the people were taken below decks and cared for as the ship transited to the Philippines where they would be processed for emigration to the United States. The members of her crew received the Humanitarian Service Medal.

===Decommissioning===
The guided missile destroyer decommissioned on 1 October 1991, was struck from the navy list on 20 November 1992 and sold to Consolidated Metals, Inc., for scrapping.

&quot;Robison&quot; was decommissioned on 1 October 1991, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 November 1992 and sold for scrap on 20 June 1994. The plan was that it would be converted to a power barge with her sister ship, the . That plan for &quot;Robison&quot; was apparently changed after the power barge failure of the &quot;Hoel&quot;.

The hull of the &quot;Robison&quot; eventually was sunk off the coast of South Carolina as part of the Marine Resources Division of the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources artificial fishing reef project. The hull of &quot;Robison&quot; is now located at .

==Awards==
&quot;Robison&quot; earned seven battle stars for service off the Vietnamese coast.

<text>Raymond Otto Stark (October 3, 1915 – January 17, 2004) was an American film producer and talent agent. Stark&#x27;s background as a literary and theatrical agent prepared him to produce some of the most profitable films of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, such as &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot; (1960), &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961), &quot;The Misfits&quot; (1961), &quot;Lolita&quot; (1962), &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1964), &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot; (1967), &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (1968), &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; (1970), &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; (1977), &quot;The Toy&quot; (1982), &quot;Annie&quot; (1982), and &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (1989).

In addition to his roster of films, Stark formed relationships with various directors and writers throughout his career. Stark made eight films with Herbert Ross, five with John Huston, and three with Sydney Pollack. Additionally, Stark&#x27;s 18-year partnership with playwright Neil Simon yielded 11 films between the duo, including &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; (1975). In 1980, the Motion Picture Academy awarded him the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for lifetime achievement in film.

== Early life ==

Raymond Otto Stark was born on October 3, 1915, in Manhattan, the second child of Sadie (née Gotlieb) and Maximilian Stark. Ray grew up on East 58th Street near Central Park. It was Ray&#x27;s mother who took a dutiful approach to his education, grooming him to be well-read and precocious. Ray attended grade school in Manhattan, skipping two grades, before attending The Kohut School, a boarding school for boys in Harrison, New York. There, Stark&#x27;s major scholastic interest was writing; he wrote articles for the school&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Kohut Klipper&quot;, in which his first article was an interview with actress Ginger Rogers whom he brazenly approached after seeing her in a play.

In 1931, at 15 years of age, Stark was the youngest student ever admitted to Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. At Rutgers, Stark continued to take a strong interest in literature (one of his favorite classes was on Shakespeare) but he did not know how to pursue it occupationally. In 1935, Stark returned to Manhattan to attend NYU Law, although he did not graduate.

As Stark&#x27;s interests shifted to journalism and entertainment, he took an opportunity to live with a friend in Los Angeles. Following a job at Forest Lawn Cemetery as a florist and then as writing assistant to comedian and ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, Stark took a job as a publicist for Warner Bros. Studios in 1937.

Stark served in the U.S. Navy during World War II.

== Seven Arts Productions (with Eliot Hyman) ==

In 1957 Ray Stark and Eliot Hyman founded Seven Arts Productions, an independent production company that made movies for release by other studios. Stark was head of production, in charge of buying film properties and supervising production, while Hyman was instrumental in forming deals and handling finances. &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot;, &quot;By Love Possessed&quot;, &quot;The Nun’s Story&quot;, and &quot;Night of the Iguana&quot;, were among some of the first works purchased by Stark with Seven Arts. However, Stark chose to produce &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot; first, a lesser-known play outside of Seven Arts.

&quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot;, which originally cast the lead from the Broadway production, France Nuyen, went on to star and mark the discovery of Chinese actress Nancy Kwan. Interpersonal complications with France Nuyen interfered with shooting, and Stark replaced her with newcomer Nancy Kwan, who was later nominated for a Golden Globe Best Actress in the role.

== Rastar Productions ==
In 1966, Stark left Seven Arts to found his own production company, Rastar Productions. Rastar&#x27;s first production was the film version of &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, starring Barbra Streisand. The company went on to produce many notable films from the 1970s to the early 2000s, including &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; (1970), &quot;The Way We Were&quot; (1973), &quot;Murder By Death&quot; (1976), &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; (1977), &quot;Seems Like Old Times&quot; (1980), &quot;Annie&quot; (1982), &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (1989) and &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot; (1996). In 1974, Rastar was acquired by Columbia Pictures, which included all Rastar property including the following Rastar property: Rastar Productions, Rastar Pictures, Rastar Features, and Rastar Television. Ray Stark then founded Rastar Films, later selling that to Columbia Pictures as well in 1980.

Stark&#x27;s final film (as Rastar Television) was the 2000 TV movie &quot;Alley Cats Strike&quot;, which was co-produced by Walt Disney Television and aired on Disney Channel. Rastar was closed when Stark himself died in 2004 and all assets were folded into now Columbia Pictures.

== Movies with Barbra Streisand ==
Although stage and film actress Anne Bancroft was the initial choice to play Fanny Brice in &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (the biopic production based on Stark&#x27;s iconic mother in-law), Stark felt drawn to Barbra Streisand, an unknown singer and performer on the rise in New York City. After a long courtship with the then unknown, Stark and Jerome Robbins (the production supervisor and director of the Broadway show) decided to cast her as their lead.

After an arduous rehearsal period filled with revisions and rewrites, &quot;Funny Girl&quot; opened to rave reviews on Broadway and became a critical and commercial success. Stark had the smash hit he&#x27;d hoped for, and Streisand emerged as a full-fledged star. For both, it was the beginning of an often stormy relationship that would span four more motion pictures for eleven years. Following the Broadway show, Stark formed Rastar Productions to finance the film version of &quot;Funny Girl&quot; due to foiled deals with Columbia and Paramount Pictures. After a year of difficult negotiations, Stark signed Streisand to Rastar Productions in a lengthy contract that bound Stark and Streisand to make four more films together: &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; (1970), &quot;The Way We Were&quot; starring Robert Redford, directed by Sydney Pollack (1973), &quot;For Pete’s Sake&quot; (1974), and &quot;Funny Lady&quot; (1975).

=== Background ===
Stark married Fanny Brice&#x27;s and Nick Arnstein&#x27;s daughter Frances Brice in 1940. In telling Fanny&#x27;s story, Stark would produce the Broadway musical, film version, and film sequel Funny Lady (all starring Streisand).

Ray Stark had commissioned an authorized biography of Brice, based on taped recollections she had dictated, but was unhappy with the result. It eventually cost him $50,000 to stop the publication of &quot;The Fabulous Fanny&quot; as it had been titled by the author. Stark then turned to Ben Hecht to write the screenplay for a biopic, but neither Hecht nor the 10 writers who succeeded him were able to produce a version that satisfied Stark. Finally, Isobel Lennart submitted &quot;My Man&quot;, which pleased both Stark and Columbia Pictures executives, who offered Stark $400,000 plus a percentage of the gross for the property.

After reading the screenplay, Mary Martin contacted Stark and proposed it be adapted for a stage musical. Stark discussed the possibility with producer David Merrick, who suggested Jule Styne and Stephen Sondheim compose the score. Sondheim told Styne &quot;I don&#x27;t want to do the life of Fanny Brice with Mary Martin. She&#x27;s not Jewish. You need someone ethnic for the part.&quot; Shortly after, Martin lost interest in the project and backed out.

Merrick discussed the project with Jerome Robbins, who gave the screenplay to Anne Bancroft. She agreed to play Brice if she could handle the score. Merrick suggested Styne collaborate with Dorothy Fields as a lyricist, but she was not interested. He went to Palm Beach, Florida for a month and composed music he thought Bancroft would be able to sing. While he was there, he met Bob Merrill, and he played the five melodies he already had written for him. Merrill agreed to write lyrics for them; these included &quot;Who Are You Now?&quot; and &quot;The Music That Makes Me Dance.&quot; Styne was happy with the results and the two men completed the rest of the score, then flew to Los Angeles to play it for Stark, Robbins, and Bancroft, who was at odds with Merrill because of an earlier personal conflict. She listened to the score, then stated &quot;I want no part of this. It&#x27;s not for me.&quot;

With Bancroft out of the picture, Eydie Gormé was considered, but she agreed to play Brice only if her husband Steve Lawrence was cast as Nicky Arnstein. Because they thought he was wrong for the role, Stark and Robbins approached Carol Burnett, who said &quot;I&#x27;d love to do it but what you need is a Jewish girl.&quot; With options running out, Styne thought Barbra Streisand, whom he remembered from &quot;I Can Get It for You Wholesale&quot;, would be perfect. She was performing at the Bon Soir in Greenwich Village, and Styne urged Robbins to see her. He was impressed and asked her to audition. Styne later recalled &quot;She looked awful...All her clothes were out of thrift shops. I saw Fran Stark staring at her, obvious distaste on her face.&quot; Despite his wife&#x27;s objections, Stark hired Streisand on the spot.

Robbins had an argument with Lennart and told Stark he wanted her replaced because he thought she was not capable of adapting her screenplay into a viable book for a stage musical. Stark refused and Robbins quit the project.

&quot;Funny Girl&quot; temporarily was shelved, and Styne moved on to other projects, including &quot;Fade Out – Fade In&quot; for Carol Burnett. Then Merrick signed Bob Fosse to direct &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, and work began on it again until Fosse quit and the show went into limbo for several months. Then Merrick suggested Stark hire Garson Kanin. It was Merrick&#x27;s last contribution to the production; shortly afterward he bowed out, and Stark became sole producer.

Streisand was not enthusiastic about Kanin as a director and insisted she wanted Robbins back, especially after Kanin suggested &quot;People&quot; be cut from the score because it didn&#x27;t fit the character. Streisand already had recorded the song for a single release, and Merrill insisted &quot;It has to be in the show because it&#x27;s the greatest thing she&#x27;s ever done.&quot; Kanin agreed to let it remain based on audience reaction to it. By the time the show opened in Boston, people were so familiar with &quot;People&quot; they applauded it during the overture.

There were problems with the script and score throughout rehearsals, and when &quot;Funny Girl&quot; opened in Boston it was too long, even though 30 minutes had been cut. The critics praised Streisand but disliked the show. Lennart continued to edit her book and deleted another 30 minutes, then the show moved to Philadelphia, where critics thought the show could be a hit if the libretto problems were rectified.

The New York opening was postponed five times while extra weeks were played out of town. Five songs were cut, and &quot;You Are Woman&quot;, a solo for Sydney Chaplin, was rewritten as a counterpoint duet. Streisand was still unhappy with Kanin and was pleased when Robbins returned to oversee the choreography by Carol Haney.

== Films with John Huston ==

A close friend and creative confidant of John Huston, Stark produced four highly successful films with the visionary director. Stark and Huston formed a close bond while shooting Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Night of The Iguana&quot; (1964) starring Richard Burton and Ava Gardner on-location in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Following their success, Huston and Stark went on to create &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot; (1967), based on the 1941 novel by author Carson McCullers and starring Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor, &quot;Fat City&quot; (1972), and the commercially successful 1982 adaption of &quot;Annie&quot; the musical starring Albert Finney, Carol Burnett, Ann Reinking, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Geoffrey Holder, Edward Herrmann, and Aileen Quinn in her film debut.

== Films with Neil Simon ==

Over an 18-year period Stark produced eleven scripts by acclaimed playwright Neil Simon, including &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; (1975), for which George Burns won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor; &quot;Murder by Death&quot; (1976), featuring an eclectic cast of Eileen Brennan, Truman Capote, James Coco, Peter Falk, Alec Guinness, Elsa Lanchester, David Niven, Peter Sellers, and Maggie Smith; &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; (1977) with Richard Dreyfuss and Marsha Mason, for which Dreyfus won the Academy Award for Best Actor; and &quot;California Suite&quot; (1978), which won Maggie Smith the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Others in the incredibly productive Neil Simon/ Rastar collaboration included &quot;Seems Like Old Times&quot; (1980), with Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase; &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot;, starring Peter Falk, and &quot;Chapter Two&quot; with James Caan and Marsha Mason.

== Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award ==
In 1980, Stark&#x27;s body of work was officially recognized when he received the prestigious Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, a rare honor given by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for lifetime achievement in film. Presented by close friend and colleague actor Kirk Douglas, whom Stark represented at Famous Artists Agency, Douglas introduced Stark as the unseen &quot;Oz&quot; of Hollywood. Stark humbly received the award, fighting impulses of stage fright to deliver a thoughtful yet funny speech. Stark was known for his distaste for public appearances and belief that talent, not producers, should receive all public attention. Stark was later awarded the David O. Selznick Lifetime Achievement Award from the Producers Guild of America in 1999, with guild President Thom Mount calling him &quot;one of Hollywood&#x27;s most prolific film producers ... the stuff of legend&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Soon after relocating to Los Angeles from New York City, Ray met his future wife, Frances Brice, at a party. She mentioned that her mother was “Baby Snooks,” the legendary comedic actress Fanny Brice, and her father was Nicky Arnstein. Although Stark failed to remember who the actress was, he soon fell in love with Fran, saying she was the most charming girl he&#x27;d ever met. Following a brief courtship, they were married on September 26, 1940. The couple had two children, Peter, and Wendy Stark Morrissey. Peter Stark (1944–1970) died by suicide in New York City. Ray Stark died of heart failure in his Los Angeles home on January 17, 2004, aged 88.

Despite a busy schedule throughout his career, Ray made time for his interest in horses. Ray and his wife Frances owned Rancho Corral de Quati, a 300-acre (1.2 km²) ranch in Los Olivos, California and were breeders of Thoroughbred racehorses. A passionate horse lover, Stark was twice named California Thoroughbred Breeder of the Year.

Stark was an avid art collector. He amassed a broad collection of outdoor sculptures by artist and close friend Henry Moore, and his walls were adorned with pieces by Monet, Picasso, and Kandinsky. Stark&#x27;s outdoor sculpture collection was bequeathed to the Getty Museum, where it is on display. The Fran and Ray Stark Sculpture Garden opened in 2007 and accounts for approximately 75% of the sculptures in the museum&#x27;s collection.

=== Philanthropy ===
In 1982, Fran and Ray Stark established The Fran and Ray Stark Foundation, which is committed to the growth of community art, culture and medicine. The Stark Foundation supports institutions in Los Angeles such as The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, USC School of Cinematic Arts, Motion Picture and Television Country House, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Homeboy Industries and several Department Chairs at David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.

The Ray Stark Family Theatre, equipped for 3D presentation, is one of three situated in the University of Southern California&#x27;s School of Cinematic Arts Complex, completed in 2010.

<doc id="518827" wikidata="Q1492758" url="?curid=518827" title="Galusha A. Grow">
<text>Galusha Aaron Grow (August 31, 1823 – March 31, 1907) was an American politician, lawyer, writer and businessman, who served as 24th Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1861 to 1863. Elected as a Democrat in the 1850 congressional elections, he switched to the newly organized Republican Party in the mid-1850s when the Democratic Party tried to force the extension of slavery into western territories.

Elected speaker for the 37th Congress, Grow presided over the House during the initial years of the American Civil War. During his tenure Congress passed the landmark Homestead Act of 1862, which he supported. Grow was defeated for reelection in 1862. For over a century he remained the last incumbent House speaker to be defeated, until Speaker Tom Foley lost his seat in 1994.

After leaving office he continued to speak out on political issues, but did not serve in elective office. Then, 31 years after leaving office, Grow won an 1894 special election to succeed William Lilly. It remains one of the longest known interregnums between terms of service for a House member. Over the course of his career, Grow represented the people of three Pennsylvania congressional districts: the (1851–1853), (1853–1863), and (1894–1903).

==Early life and education==
Grow was born Aaron Galusha Grow in Ashford, Connecticut. His given names were the suggestions of an aunt living in Vermont, who was visiting Grow&#x27;s mother when he was christened: &quot;Aaron&quot; was the aunt&#x27;s husband&#x27;s name (his full name was Aaron Nichols (1764–1807)), and &quot;Galusha&quot; was the surname of a governor of Vermont she admired. His family called him Galusha when he was growing up, and before Grow was a teenager, he had started writing his name with his given names reversed. He was educated at Franklin Academy in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, and later at Amherst College. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in November 1847 and then began his law practice.

== Political career ==


=== Early elections===
Grow ran as a Democrat in the 1850 election and served as a member of that party during the 32nd and 33rd congresses, and into the 34th Congress. He switched parties in the wake of President Pierce&#x27;s signing of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. He ran as a Republican in the 1856 election and remained a member of that party for the rest of his political career.

=== Congressional brawl of 1858 ===
During the 35th United States Congress, on February 5, 1858, he was physically attacked by Democrat Laurence M. Keitt in the House chambers, leading to a brawl between northerners and southerners. Keitt, offended by Grow&#x27;s having stepped over to his side of the House chamber, dismissively demanded that Grow sit down, calling him a &quot;black Republican puppy&quot;. Grow responded by telling Keitt that &quot;No negro-driver shall crack his whip over me.&quot; Keitt became enraged and went for Grow&#x27;s throat, shouting that he would &quot;choke [him] for that&quot;. A large brawl involving approximately fifty representatives erupted on the House floor, ending only when a missed punch from Rep. Cadwallader Washburn upended the hairpiece of Rep. William Barksdale. The embarrassed Barksdale accidentally replaced the wig backwards, causing both sides to erupt in spontaneous laughter.

Later that year Grow was re-elected to a fifth term. When the next Congress convened in December 1859, he was one of 90 congressmen to receive votes during the two-month-long 44-ballot speaker election, dropping out following the first ballot.
On December 29, 1859, North Carolina Congressman Lawrence O&#x27;Bryan Branch challenged Galusha Grow to a duel after the two exchanged insults on the House Floor. Both men and their seconds were arrested by District of Columbia police before the duel could take place.

=== 1861 speaker election ===
The deepening rift between slave states and free states overshadowed Grow&#x27;s 1861 re-election victory, as a national crisis erupted in December 1860 when South Carolina became the first of several Southern states to adopt an Ordinance of Secession. Four months later, on April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter, igniting the Civil War. In response, President Abraham Lincoln called the 37th Congress into session on July 4. When the House convened that day, Grow was nominated to be Speaker of the House; also nominated was Francis Preston Blair Jr. Grow was elected on the first ballot, but only after Blair withdrew following the roll call vote, at which time 28 votes shifted to Grow.

1861 election for speaker159 votes cast, 80 votes necessary to win election:
&lt;br&gt; Galusha A. Grow (R–Pennsylvania) 99
&lt;br&gt; Francis Preston Blair Jr. (R–Missouri) 12
&lt;br&gt; John J. Crittenden (CU–Kentucky) 12
&lt;br&gt; John S. Phelps (D–Missouri) 7
&lt;br&gt; Clement Vallandingham (D–Ohio) 7
&lt;br&gt; Erastus Corning (D–New York) 7
&lt;br&gt; Samuel S. Cox (D–Ohio) 6
&lt;br&gt; &quot;Others&quot; 9

Although events of the war dominated and the First Battle of Bull Run occurred only two weeks after the 37th Congress was called into session, under Grow&#x27;s leadership, several major acts of Congress were passed and signed into law, particularly the Morrill Land-Grant College Act (passed House June 17, 1862), the Pacific Railway Act authorizing land grants to encourage the construction of the transcontinental railroad, and the Homestead Act, which in over a century resulted in the establishment of 1.6 million homesteads.

=== Loss of congressional seat and interim ===
Grow, a supporter of the Radical Republicans, was defeated in his re-election bid in 1862, becoming the second sitting House Speaker in a row to lose his seat.

Grow was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1864 and 1868.

He moved to Houston, Texas in 1871, and that year became president of what became known as the International - Great Northern Railroad, a position he held until 1875. He then returned to Pennsylvania and the practice of law from 1875 to 1894.

=== Return to Congress ===

Grow returned to the United States Congress as a member at-large from Pennsylvania from 1894 to 1903; was the chairman of the committee on education in the 56th Congress.

== Death and legacy ==
Grow resided in Glenwood, Pennsylvania, from 1903 until his death there on March 31, 1907. A biography of Galusha Grow, &quot;Galusha A. Grow: Father of the Homestead Law&quot;, was written by James T. Du Bois and Gertrude S. Mathews and published by Houghton Mifflin in 1917.

A monument to Grow was erected in 1915 at the Susquehanna County Courthouse Complex in Montrose, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="518831" wikidata="Q2609735" url="?curid=518831" title="Chaquan">
<text>Chaquan () is a Chinese martial art that features graceful movements and some acrobatic aerial maneuvers and includes a large range of weapons. &quot;Chaquan&quot; falls under the classification &quot;Changquan&quot;, a type of Northern Chinese martial arts known for their extended, long movements.

The style is associated with the Hui people and related to the Turkic people from Central Asia. In the legend, a Turkic warrior named &quot;Zha Mi-Er&quot; (maybe Sameer [name of Arabic origin] or Dämir [meaning &quot;iron&quot; in Turkic]); ) from current Xinjiang or Central Asia passed down this martial art to the Chinese locals in the current Xandong province during the late Ming dynasty. One famous master of &quot;Chaquan&quot; was Wang Ziping, who was known for his great strength. Other modern day masters include Zhang Wenguang, Ma Jinbiao, and Liu Hongchi.

&quot;Chaquan&quot; is one of the sources of the contemporary Wushu &quot;Changquan&quot;, which is often seen in movies and tournaments.

&quot;Chaquan&quot; is a system that has six main weapons (staff, saber, sword, spear, kwandao, hookswords). It emphasizes long range movements and stances combined with speed and power. The style includes many forms, including 10 lines of tantui for basic power training, 10 longer sets of &quot;Chaquan&quot;, and other forms as well.

<text>The voiced velar nasal, also known as [[Eng (letter)|eng]], engma, or agma (from Greek &#x27;fragment&#x27;), is a type of consonantal sound used in some spoken languages. It is the sound of &quot;ng&quot; in English &quot;sing&quot; as well as &quot;n&quot; before velar consonants as in &quot;English&quot; and &quot;ink&quot;. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1. The IPA symbol is similar to , the symbol for the retroflex nasal, which has a rightward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the right stem, and to , the symbol for the palatal nasal, which has a leftward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the left stem.

While almost all languages have and as phonemes, is rarer. Half of the 469 languages surveyed in had a velar nasal phoneme; as a further curiosity, many of them limit its occurrence to the syllable coda. The velar nasal does not occur in many of the languages of the Americas, the Middle East, or the Caucasus, but it is extremely common among Australian Aboriginal languages, languages of Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asian and Southeast Asian languages, and Polynesian languages. In many languages that do not have the velar nasal as a phoneme, such as the Romance languages, it occurs as an allophone of before velar consonants. This kind of assimilation can even be found in languages with phonemic voiced velar nasals, such as English. An example of this phenomenon is the word &quot;income&quot;; its underlying representation, , can be realized as either or .

An example of a language that lacks a phonemic or allophonic velar nasal is Russian, in which is pronounced as laminal denti-alveolar even before velar consonants.

Some languages have the pre-velar nasal, which is articulated slightly more front compared with the place of articulation of the prototypical velar nasal, though not as front as the prototypical palatal nasal - see that article for more information.

Conversely, some languages have the post-velar nasal, which is articulated slightly behind the place of articulation of a prototypical velar nasal, though not as back as the prototypical uvular nasal.

<doc id="518843" wikidata="Q312743" url="?curid=518843" title="Neil Sedaka">
<text>Neil Sedaka (; born March 13, 1939) is an American singer, songwriter and pianist. Since his music career began in 1957, he has sold millions of records worldwide and has written or co-written over 500 songs for himself and other artists, collaborating mostly with lyricists Howard &quot;Howie&quot; Greenfield and Phil Cody.

After a short-lived tenure as a founding member of the doo-wop group the Tokens, Sedaka achieved a string of hit singles over the late 1950s and early 1960s, including &quot;Oh! Carol&quot; (1959), &quot;Calendar Girl&quot; (1960), &quot;Happy Birthday Sweet Sixteen&quot; (1961) and &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard to Do&quot; (1962). His popularity declined by the mid-1960s, but was revived in the mid-1970s, solidified by the 1975 US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number ones &quot;Laughter in the Rain&quot; and &quot;Bad Blood&quot;. Sedaka maintained a successful career as a songwriter, penning hits for other artists including &quot;Stupid Cupid&quot; (Connie Francis), &quot;(Is This the Way to) Amarillo&quot; (Tony Christie) and &quot;Love Will Keep Us Together&quot; (Captain &amp; Tennille). He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1983 and continues to perform, mounting mini-concerts on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Early life: Juilliard and the Brill Building==
Sedaka was born in Brooklyn. His father, Mordechai &quot;Mac&quot; Sedaka, was a taxi driver of Lebanese Jewish descent. Sedaka&#x27;s paternal grandparents came to the United States from Istanbul in 1910. Sedaka&#x27;s mother, Eleanor (née Appel), was an Ashkenazi Jew of Polish and Russian descent. He grew up in Brighton Beach. His father&#x27;s cousin, Rachel Gorman (née Cohen), daughter of Isaac Cohen and Calo Cohen (née Sedaca or Sedaka), was married to Morris Gorman (né Garmezano; paternal uncle to singer Eydie Gormé). Gormé&#x27;s mother was of Lebanese Jewish descent.

Sedaka demonstrated musical aptitude in his second-grade choral class and, when his teacher sent a note home suggesting he take piano lessons, his mother took a part-time job in an Abraham &amp; Straus department store for six months to pay for a second-hand upright. In 1947, he auditioned successfully for a piano scholarship to the Juilliard School of Music&#x27;s Preparatory Division for Children, which he attended on Saturdays. His mother had wanted him to become a classical pianist like his contemporary Van Cliburn, and Sedaka continued to show fondness for (and capacity to play) classical music throughout his life.

At the same time, to his mother&#x27;s dismay, Sedaka was discovering pop music; his mother eventually acquiesced when Sedaka received a five-figure royalty check for his hit &quot;Calendar Girl&quot; in 1961. When Sedaka was 13, a neighbor heard him playing and introduced him to her 16-year-old son, Howard Greenfield, an aspiring poet and lyricist. They became two of the Brill Building&#x27;s composers.

Sedaka and Greenfield wrote songs together throughout much of their young lives. Before rock and roll became popular, Sedaka and Greenfield found inspiration from show tunes. When Sedaka became a major teen pop star, the pair continued writing hits for Sedaka and numerous other artists. When the Beatles and the British Invasion took American music in a different direction, Sedaka was left without a recording career. In the early 1970s, he decided a major change in his life was necessary and moved his family to Britain. Sedaka and Greenfield mutually agreed to end their partnership with &quot;Our Last Song Together&quot;. Sedaka began a new composing partnership with lyricist Phil Cody, from Pleasantville, New York.

==Career==

===Rise to fame with RCA Victor: the late 1950s===
After graduating from Abraham Lincoln High School, Sedaka and some of his classmates formed a band called the Linc-Tones. The band had minor regional hits with songs like &quot;While I Dream&quot;, &quot;I Love My Baby&quot;, &quot;Come Back, Joe&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, before Sedaka launched his solo career and left the group in 1957. The Linc-Tones, later renamed the Tokens near the end of Sedaka&#x27;s tenure with the group, went on to have four top-40 hits of their own without Sedaka. Sedaka&#x27;s first three solo singles, &quot;Laura Lee&quot;, &quot;Ring-a-Rockin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Oh, Delilah!&quot; failed to become hits (although &quot;Ring-a-Rockin&#x27;&quot; earned him the first of many appearances on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot;), but they demonstrated his ability to perform as a solo singer, so RCA Victor signed him to a recording contract.

His first single for RCA Victor, &quot;The Diary&quot;, was inspired by Connie Francis, one of Sedaka and Greenfield&#x27;s most important clients, while the three were taking a temporary break during their idea-making for a new song. Francis was writing in her diary, Sedaka asked if he could read it, and Connie said no. After Little Anthony and the Imperials passed on the song, Sedaka recorded it himself, and his debut single hit the Top 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 14 in 1958.

His second single, a novelty tune titled &quot;I Go Ape&quot;, just missed the Top 40, peaking at No. 42, but it became a more successful single in the United Kingdom with a No. 9. The third single, &quot;Crying My Heart Out for You&quot;, was a commercial failure, missing the Hot 100 entirely, peaking at No. 111 but reaching No. 6 on the pop charts in Italy. RCA Victor had lost money on &quot;I Go Ape&quot; and &quot;Crying My Heart Out For You&quot; and was ready to drop Sedaka from their label; Sedaka feared he was headed for one-hit wonder status. Sedaka and his manager, Al Nevins, persuaded the RCA executives to give him one more chance.

Sedaka then bought the three biggest hit singles of the time and listened to them repeatedly, studying the song structure, chord progressions, lyrics and harmonies before writing his next songs. &quot;Oh! Carol&quot; delivered Sedaka his first domestic Top 10 hit, reaching No. 9 on the Hot 100 in 1959 and going to No. 1 on the Italian pop charts in 1960, giving Sedaka his first No. 1 ranking. In the UK, the song spent a total of 17 weeks in the top 40, peaking at No. 3 (4 weeks). In addition, the B-side, &quot;One Way Ticket&quot;, reached No. 1 on the pop charts in Japan. Sedaka had dated Carole King when he was still at high school, which gave him the idea to use her name in the song. Gerry Goffin—King&#x27;s husband—took the tune and wrote the playful response &quot;Oh! Neil&quot;, which King recorded and released as an unsuccessful single the same year. Thus, this was the only time the melody of the song was used by a popular artist and a future sensation around the same time.

=== Big hits in the early 1960s ===
After establishing himself in 1958, Sedaka wrote many more hits from 1960 to 1962. His flow of Top 30 hits during this period included: &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; (No. 9, 1960); &quot;You Mean Everything to Me&quot; (No. 17, 1960); &quot;Run, Samson, Run&quot; (No. 27, 1960); &quot;Calendar Girl&quot; (No. 4, 1961; also reached No. 1 on the Japanese and Canadian pop charts); &quot;Little Devil&quot; (No. 11, 1961); &quot;Happy Birthday Sweet Sixteen&quot; (No. 6, 1961); his signature song, &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard To Do&quot; (No. 1, two weeks: August 11 and 18, 1962); and &quot;Next Door to an Angel&quot; (No. 5, 1962). For several of those songs, Sedaka was paired with Stan Applebaum and His Orchestra. Singles not making the Top 30 during this period included &quot;Sweet Little You&quot; (No. 59, 1961) and &quot;King of Clowns&quot; (No. 45, 1962). RCA Victor issued four LPs of his works in the United States and Great Britain during this period, and also produced &quot;Scopitone&quot; and &quot;Cinebox&quot; videos of &quot;Calendar Girl&quot; in 1961, &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard To Do&quot; in 1962, and &quot;The Dreamer&quot; in 1963. His second LP was an album mostly of old standards. He made regular appearances on such TV programs as &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and &quot;Shindig!&quot; during this period.

===Writing for other performers===

====Connie Francis====
When Sedaka was not recording his own songs, he and Howard Greenfield were writing for other performers, most notably in their earliest days Connie Francis. Francis began searching for a new hit after her 1958 single &quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now?&quot;. She was introduced to Sedaka and Greenfield, who played for her every ballad they had written. Francis began writing in her diary while the two played the last of their songs. After they finished, Francis told them they wrote beautiful ballads but that they were too intellectual for the young generation. Greenfield suggested that they play a song they had written for the Shepherd Sisters. Sedaka protested that Francis would be insulted by being played such a puerile song, but Greenfield reminded him Francis had not accepted their other suggestions and they had nothing to lose. After Sedaka played &quot;Stupid Cupid&quot;, Francis told them they had just played her new hit. Francis&#x27; rendition of the song reached No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, while it topped the UK Singles Chart.

While Francis was writing in her diary, Sedaka asked her if he could read what she had written. Francis said no. This inspired Sedaka to write &quot;The Diary&quot;, his own first hit single. Sedaka and Greenfield wrote many of Connie Francis&#x27; hits, such as &quot;Fallin&#x27;&quot; and the &quot;Theme from &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot;&quot;, the film in which she starred. This hit the Top 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop singles chart and Francis had several No. 1 singles. &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot; eventually became her signature song.

====Jimmy Clanton====
Sedaka and Greenfield also wrote some of Jimmy Clanton&#x27;s hits, such as &quot;Another Sleepless Night&quot;, &quot;What Am I Gonna Do?&quot; and &quot;All the Words in the World&quot;. Sedaka himself recorded each of these three songs: &quot;Another Sleepless Night&quot; appears on his &quot;Rock With Sedaka&quot; debut album; &quot;What Am I Gonna Do?&quot; was the B-side of &quot;Going Home to Mary Lou&quot; and appeared on his 1961 album &quot;Neil Sedaka Sings &quot;Little Devil&quot; and His Other Hits&quot;; and &quot;All the Words in the World&quot; was recorded but was kept in the RCA Victor vaults until 1977, at the height of Sedaka&#x27;s return to popularity, when it was released on the album &quot;Neil Sedaka: The &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s&quot;.

===Session work===
Sedaka also contributed some work as a session pianist during his heyday as a pop singer-songwriter. His piano playing is heard on &quot;Dream Lover&quot;, Bobby Darin&#x27;s 1959 hit.

=== Foreign-language recordings ===

Sedaka was very popular in Italy. Many of his English-language records were released there and proved quite successful, especially &quot;Crying My Heart Out for You&quot; (Italian No. 6, 1959) and &quot;Oh! Carol&quot; (Italian No. 1, 1960).

In 1961, Sedaka began to record some of his hits in Italian, starting with &quot;Esagerata&quot; and &quot;Un giorno inutile&quot;, local versions of &quot;Little Devil&quot; and &quot;I Must Be Dreaming&quot;, respectively. Other recordings followed, such as &quot;Tu non lo sai&quot; (&quot;Breaking Up Is Hard to Do&quot;), &quot;Il re dei pagliacci&quot; (&quot;King of Clowns&quot;), &quot;I tuoi capricci&quot; (&quot;Look Inside Your Heart&quot;), and &quot;La terza luna&quot; (&quot;Waiting For Never&quot;). &quot;La terza luna&quot; reached No. 1 on the Italian pop charts in April 1963. &quot;Cinebox&quot; videos exist for &quot;La terza luna&quot; and &quot;I tuoi capricci&quot;. Sedaka&#x27;s Italian diction was impressive; his recordings in Italian had very little American accent. RCA Victor&#x27;s Italiana branch distributed his records in Italy and released three compilation LPs of Sedaka&#x27;s Italian recordings.

Sedaka also recorded an album in Yiddish (&quot;Brighton Beach Memories – Neil Sedaka Sings Yiddish&quot;), several songs in Spanish including &quot;Mi Vecinita&quot; (&quot;Next Door to an Angel&quot;), a handful of songs in German, and one single apiece in Hebrew, Japanese, and Canadian French. His English-language recordings were also quite popular internationally; &quot;One-Way Ticket to the Blues&quot; and &quot;Calendar Girl&quot; reached No. 1 on the Japanese pop charts in 1959 and 1961. He also enjoyed popularity in Latin America for his Spanish-language recordings. Many of these were pressed onto 78 rpm discs.

Sedaka stated in 2020 that he was talked into focusing on the international markets because Elvis Presley, the biggest rock star in America, never toured overseas (largely because of Colonel Tom Parker&#x27;s desire to avoid immigration officials), and because his publishers and managers considered it a much lower risk for a new performer not to face American audiences who knew him.

===Mid-1960s===

The year 1962 was one of the most important of Sedaka&#x27;s career, with &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard To Do&quot; reaching No. 1 and &quot;Next Door to an Angel&quot; reaching No. 5. After this his popularity began to wane and his 1963 singles enjoyed only moderate success: &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot; (No. 17), &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Steady Again&quot; (No. 26), &quot;The Dreamer&quot; (No. 47), and &quot;Bad Girl&quot; (No. 33). &quot;Bad Girl&quot; was Sedaka&#x27;s last Top 40 hit in the U.S. until 1974.

In 1964 Sedaka&#x27;s career began a sharp decline, hastened by The Beatles&#x27; arrival on the radio and TV, and the rest of the so-called British Invasion. When describing the Beatles&#x27; effect on his career in the mid-1960s, Sedaka put it brusquely: &quot;The Beatles—not good!&quot; He would later describe it in 2023: &quot;after five years of hits... the bottom fell out.&quot; From 1964 to 1966, only three of his singles cracked the Hot 100: &quot;Sunny&quot; (No. 86, 1964), &quot;The World through a Tear&quot; (No. 76, 1965), and &quot;The Answer to My Prayer&quot; (No. 89, 1965). His other singles from this era—&quot;The Closest Thing To Heaven&quot;, &quot;I Hope He Breaks Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Let The People Talk&quot;, &quot;The Answer Lies Within&quot; and &quot;We Can Make It If We Try&quot;—all missed the Hot 100, the same fate since Sedaka&#x27;s third U.S. single for RCA Victor, and became commercial failures.

To make matters worse, RCA Victor refused to release his new recording, &quot;It Hurts to Be in Love&quot;, because he had not recorded at their own studios, as stipulated by his contract. Sedaka attempted another recording of this song in RCA&#x27;s studios, but the results were unsatisfactory. Howard Greenfield and Helen Miller, the song&#x27;s co-writers, offered it instead to Gene Pitney. Pitney took the existing musical track, replacing Sedaka&#x27;s lead vocal track with his own. Everything else was Sedaka, including his own arrangement and backing vocals, piano-playing, and usual female backup singers. Pitney ended up with a No. 7 hit for himself and his record label, Musicor, in 1964.

For the remainder of his tenure with RCA Victor, Sedaka never fully recovered from the effects of Beatlemania, the loss of &quot;It Hurts to Be in Love&quot; to Pitney, or the failure of his recordings. RCA decided not to renew his contract when it expired in 1966, leaving Sedaka without a recording label. He went into retirement as a performing artist.

Although Sedaka&#x27;s stature as a recording artist was at a low ebb in the late 1960s, he was able to maintain his career through songwriting. Because his publisher, Aldon Music, was acquired by Screen Gems, two of his songs were recorded by The Monkees. Other hits Sedaka wrote in this period included The Cyrkle&#x27;s versions of &quot;We Had a Good Thing Goin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Workin&#x27; On a Groovy Thing&quot;; a Top 40 R&amp;B hit for Patti Drew in 1968; and a Top 20 pop hit for The 5th Dimension in 1969. Also, &quot;Make the Music Play&quot; was included on Frankie Valli&#x27;s charting album &quot;Timeless&quot;.

On a 1965 episode of the quiz show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, Sedaka&#x27;s secret was that he was to represent the United States at the 1966 Tchaikovsky classical piano competition in Moscow. Unaware of Sedaka&#x27;s secret, panelist Henry Morgan challenged Sedaka with the fact that the Soviet bureaucracy had outlawed rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music, and that any Western music young Russians wanted had to be smuggled into the country. Once Sedaka&#x27;s secret had been revealed, he impressed the show&#x27;s panelists with his performance of Frederic Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Fantaisie Impromptu&quot;. Morgan&#x27;s warning turned out to be prescient, however: despite Sedaka&#x27;s classical roots, his &quot;other&quot; life as a pop star spurred the Soviet Union to disqualify him from entering the competition.

Sedaka also made an appearance in the 1968 movie &quot;Playgirl Killer&quot;, where he performed a song called &quot;The Waterbug&quot;.

===Struggles of the late 1960s to early 1970s===

====Australia years====
Sedaka worked to revive his solo career in the early 1970s. Despite his waning chart appeal in the US in the late 1960s, he remained very popular as a concert attraction, notably in the UK and Australia. In 2010, as a guest on Australian disc jockey Bob Rogers&#x27; radio show, he thanked Rogers and Australian music fans for standing by him during that challenging time: &quot;You know, Bob, in my lean years—I called them &#x27;The Hungry Years&#x27;—it was Bob Rogers and Australia who welcomed me.&quot; Sedaka made several trips to Australia to play cabaret dates, and his commercial comeback began when the single &quot;Star-Crossed Lovers&quot; became a major hit there. The song went to No. 1 nationally in April 1969—giving Sedaka his first charting single anywhere in four years. It also came in at No. 5 in &quot;Go-Set&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the Top 40 Australian singles of 1969. Later that year, with the support of Festival Records, he recorded a new LP of original material entitled &quot;Workin&#x27; on a Groovy Thing&quot; (released in the United Kingdom as &quot;Sounds of Sedaka&quot;) at Festival Studios in Sydney. It was co-produced by Festival staff producer Pat Aulton, with arrangements by John Farrar (who later achieved international fame for his work with Olivia Newton-John) and backing by Australian session musicians including guitarist Jimmy Doyle (Ayers Rock) and noted jazz musician-composer John Sangster. One of the tracks from the album, &quot;Wheeling, West Virginia&quot;, reached No. 20 in Australia in early 1970. The album is also notable because it was Sedaka&#x27;s first album to include collaborations with writers other than long-time lyricist Howard Greenfield; the title track featured lyrics by Roger Atkins and four other songs were co-written with Carole Bayer Sager.

====&quot;Emergence&quot; and &quot;Solitaire&quot;====
In 1971, Sedaka reunited with RCA and released the &quot;Emergence&quot; album. Singles from that album included &quot;I&#x27;m A Song (Sing Me)&quot;, &quot;Silent Movies&quot;, &quot;Superbird&quot;, and &quot;Rosemary Blue&quot;. Good friend and New York music impresario Don Kirshner attempted to make the U.S. release of &quot;Emergence&quot; a comeback for Sedaka, but the album and single releases had no appreciable success, and RCA showed little interest in promoting the album. After the failure of &quot;Emergence&quot; in the US market, Sedaka left New York and moved to the UK.

In 1972, Sedaka embarked on a successful British tour and was introduced by Harvey Lisberg to the four future members of 10cc (best known to American audiences for &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot; and &quot;The Things We Do for Love&quot;) with whom he recorded the &quot;Solitaire&quot; album at their Strawberry Studios in Stockport issued by RCA in 1972. As well as the title track, &quot;Solitaire&quot;, which was successfully covered by Andy Williams (UK Top 5 singles chart) and the Carpenters (US Top 20), it included two UK Top 40 singles, one of which (&quot;Beautiful You&quot;) also charted briefly in America, Sedaka&#x27;s first US chart appearance in ten years. &quot;Solitaire&quot; was the first collaboration between Sedaka and Phil Cody, whom Sedaka felt was an ideal lyricist for writing music in the singer-songwriter period; Sedaka and Cody &quot;clicked&quot; as songwriters and began a prolonged collaboration between the two. Sedaka took a different approach to songwriting with Cody compared to Greenfield, with whom he was arguing frequently near the end of their collaboration; whereas he allowed Greenfield in the studio during recording, he met with Cody off-site to write songs. Cody did not consider Sedaka to be a personal friend; he mainly saw his work with Sedaka as a work project to bring the singer into the modern era.

===Return to success in the mid-1970s===
====Newfound success====

A year later he reconvened with the Strawberry team, who had by then charted with their own debut &quot;10cc&quot; album, to record &quot;The Tra-La Days Are Over&quot; for MGM Records, which started the second phase of his career and included his original version of the hit song &quot;Love Will Keep Us Together&quot; (also a US No. 1 hit two years later for Captain &amp; Tennille). This album also marked the effective end of his writing partnership with Greenfield, commemorated by the track &quot;Our Last Song Together&quot; (later the last hit song for Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods, whose version hit No. 95). They reunited, however, and composed together again, before Greenfield&#x27;s death in 1986. From 1974 onward, Sedaka&#x27;s records were issued in Europe and around the world on the Polydor label. His first album of new material with Polydor was &quot;Laughter in the Rain&quot; (1974).

Darby Crash referred to Sedaka as &quot;the real godfather of punk&quot; due to his unaffected, simple chord progressions and unpretentious lyrics, saying that Calendar Girl &quot;had all of punk right there-you just had to get high and play that pure rock and roll just like that.&quot;

====Career with The Rocket Record Company====
Elton John and Sedaka met at a party in London in 1973. When John learned Sedaka had no American record label, he suggested Sedaka sign with his Rocket Record Company, Limited, and Sedaka accepted the proposition. When John visited Sedaka at his London apartment, they discussed plans for relaunching his career in the United States.

John said he had &quot;always been a Sedaka fan anyway&quot;. He went on to say:

So the basic plan was as simple as finding out what he wanted to have on his album—which turned out to be a compilation from his British albums. It had been like Elvis coming up and giving us the chance to release his records. We couldn&#x27;t believe our luck.

====&quot;Sedaka&#x27;s Back&quot;====
Sedaka returned to the U.S. album charts with the release of &quot;Sedaka&#x27;s Back&quot;, a compilation of songs from three albums he had already recorded in the UK—namely &quot;Solitaire&quot;, &quot;The Tra-La Days Are Over&quot;, and &quot;Laughter in the Rain&quot;. It was only the second Sedaka album ever to chart in the U.S. Sedaka was known principally as a singles artist up to that point in his career; his only other American charting album was &quot;Neil Sedaka Sings His Greatest Hits&quot;, a compilation of his early singles. Although the single was released in the autumn of 1974 and was very slow in building in sales and at radio, eventually Sedaka found himself once again topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart (February 1, 1975) with &quot;Laughter in the Rain&quot;. It was Sedaka&#x27;s second No. 1 single thus far at that point in his career (after 1962&#x27;s original version of &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard to Do&quot;) and solidly reestablished Sedaka&#x27;s popularity in America. Sedaka followed the success of &quot;Laughter in the Rain&quot; with a more politically motivated song, &quot;The Immigrant&quot;, inspired by the songwriters&#x27; parents and by John Lennon, then facing immigration issues at the time. &quot;The Immigrant&quot; reached number 22 but topped the easy listening charts.

====Writing for artists of the 1970s====
In late 1972, producer Stig Anderson approached Sedaka to write the lyrics for a single by a new Swedish pop quartet then known as Björn &amp; Benny, Agnetha &amp; Anni-Frid. Sedaka agreed, on the condition he liked the song. Anderson, who had co-written the Swedish original with lyricist Björn Ulvaeus and composer Benny Andersson, intended to enter &quot;Ring Ring&quot; in the 1973 Eurovision Song Contest and believed with strong English lyrics it had the potential to become an international hit. He sent a tape of the song together with a rough translation to Sedaka, who within days returned original lyrics, co-written with Phil Cody. The song was entered into the Swedish Eurovision selections on February 10, 1973, but placed third. The band, renamed ABBA, made &quot;Ring Ring&quot; the title track of their first album, released on March 26, 1973. The single, credited to Andersson, Ulvaeus, Anderson, Sedaka and Cody, reached number 1 in Sweden and Belgium, and charted in the top 5 in at least four other countries. Sedaka later said that ABBA&#x27;s &quot;songwriting and production are in a class by themselves.&quot;

Sedaka and Greenfield co-wrote &quot;Love Will Keep Us Together&quot;, a No. 1 hit for Captain &amp; Tennille and the biggest hit for the entire year of 1975. Toni Tennille paid tribute to Sedaka&#x27;s welcome return to music business success with her ad lib of &quot;Sedaka is back&quot; in the outro while she was laying down her own backing vocals for the track. &quot;Captain&quot; Daryl Dragon and Toni also recorded a Spanish-language version of the song the same year that cracked the top half of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 chart (&quot;Por Amor Viviremos&quot;, US pop No. 49).

====&quot;Overnight Success/The Hungry Years&quot;====
In late 1975, Sedaka&#x27;s most successful year of his career continued as he earned yet more chart success with the release of his second Rocket Records album, &quot;The Hungry Years&quot;. This album was an American edition of Sedaka&#x27;s British Polydor album &quot;Overnight Success&quot;. The first single, &quot;Bad Blood&quot;, hit No. 1 on the Billboard 100 and stayed there for three weeks (October 11, 18 and 25, 1975), was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and was the most commercially successful individual single of his career. Elton John provided uncredited backing vocals for &quot;Bad Blood&quot;. Despite their later falling out that resulted in Sedaka moving from Elton&#x27;s Rocket Records to Elektra, Sedaka has credited John as being responsible for his successful return to the U.S. pop music scene. John has stated, &quot;I only appear on the records of people I really know or like.&quot;

Another highlight from &quot;The Hungry Years&quot; was Sedaka&#x27;s new version of &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard to Do&quot;. His 1962 original, a No. 1 hit single, was upbeat; the remake was a slow ballad, which Sedaka had arranged for Lenny Welch five years prior. Sedaka&#x27;s version hit No. 8 on the Hot 100 in early 1976, making him the only artist to ever record an entirely reinterpreted version of a song where both versions reached the Billboard Top 10. (Welch&#x27;s version had reached No. 34.) The 1976 ballad version also hit No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s Adult Contemporary chart.

====&quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;====
Later in 1976, Sedaka released a third and final album with Elton John&#x27;s label The Rocket Record Company, &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;. The first single, &quot;Love in the Shadows,&quot; was an uncharacteristically solid rock song featuring a scorching guitar solo. While it peaked at No. 16 on the Hot 100, it was the first of his three &quot;comeback&quot; albums&#x27; debut singles not to hit No. 1—or even the Top 10. The second single was the album&#x27;s title track, once again featuring Elton on uncredited backing vocals. While it cracked the Top 40 (peaking at No. 36), it also marked the beginning of a slowdown in Sedaka&#x27;s music sales and radio play, not unlike what he experienced in 1964 when The Beatles and the British Invasion arrived.

Sedaka subsequently left Rocket and signed with Elektra Records.

Sedaka met John again several times after his departure from Rocket, and he described their meetings as &quot;cordial, but cold&quot;. The ice eventually thawed, however, and in the foreword to Sedaka&#x27;s 2013 biography, John wrote of their friendship in glowing and positive terms.

===Late 1970s===

====Transition from Rocket to Elektra====
Sedaka recorded four albums for Elektra Records: &quot;A Song&quot; (which produced the adult contemporary hits &quot;Alone at Last&quot; and a recording of &quot;Amarillo&quot;), &quot;All You Need Is the Music&quot;, &quot;In the Pocket&quot; and &quot;Neil Sedaka Now&quot;. The only top-40 pop hit to emerge from the Elektra records, as well as Sedaka&#x27;s last to date, was &quot;Should&#x27;ve Never Let You Go&quot;, a duet between Sedaka and his daughter Dara, which had appeared on &quot;In the Pocket&quot; in 1980.

====Reissue of RCA-era recordings====
Throughout the 1970s, Sedaka&#x27;s former record company, RCA, reissued his 1960s-era songs on compilation LPs on the RCA Victor and RCA Camden labels. Sedaka released a final album of new material with RCA, consisting of a live concert he gave in Sydney. The album was released on the RCA International label in Australia and Europe as &quot;Neil Sedaka On Stage&quot; in 1974.

===1980s===
Mac Sedaka, Neil&#x27;s father, died on June 6, 1981, of metastatic colon cancer; Neil was at his bedside singing his father&#x27;s favorite song, Sedaka&#x27;s 1965 song &quot;Pictures From The Past&quot;, when his father briefly awoke from his coma before his death. Sedaka re-recorded the song that same year.

Sedaka left Elektra and signed with Curb Records. Sedaka recorded two albums on the Curb label – &quot;Come See About Me&quot;, a covers album, in 1983 and &quot;The Good Times&quot; in 1986. Neither of these albums fared well on the charts or in terms of sales, with only modest success for the singles that were released from them (another duet with Dara, a cover of &quot;Your Precious Love&quot;, reached the adult contemporary charts); Sedaka left Curb in 1986.

===Other successes===
American singer-songwriter Ben Folds credited Sedaka on his &quot;iTunes Originals&quot; album as an inspiration for his own song-publishing career. When Folds heard that Sedaka had a song published by the age of 13, Folds set a similar goal, despite the fact that Sedaka did not actually publish until he was 16.

In 1985, songs composed by Sedaka were adapted for the Japanese anime television series &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot;. These included the two opening themes &quot;Zeta-Toki wo Koete&quot; (based on Sedaka&#x27;s &quot;Better Days Are Coming&quot;) and &quot;Mizu no Hoshi e Ai wo Komete&quot; (originally in English as &quot;For Us to Decide&quot;, but the English version was never recorded), as well as the end theme &quot;Hoshizora no Believe&quot; (based on Sedaka&#x27;s &quot;Bad and Beautiful&quot;). Due to copyright restrictions, the songs were replaced for the North American DVD, as well as for Japanese online releases of the series until 2017.

In 1994, Sedaka provided the voice for Neil Moussaka, a parody of himself in Food Rocks, an attraction at Epcot from 1994 to 2006.

A musical comedy based on the songs of Sedaka, &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard to Do&quot;, was written in 2005 by Erik Jackson and Ben H. Winters; it is now under license to Theatrical Rights Worldwide.

A biographical musical, &quot;Laughter in the Rain&quot;, produced by Bill Kenwright and Laurie Mansfield and starring Wayne Smith as Sedaka, had its world premiere at the Churchill Theatre in the London borough of Bromley on March 4, 2010. Sedaka attended the opening and joined the cast onstage for an impromptu curtain call of the title song.

===Into the 21st century===

Sedaka was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1983, has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and was an October 2006 inductee of the Long Island Music Hall of Fame. On November 15, 2013, Pacific Pioneer Broadcasters in Los Angeles gave him their Art Gilmore Career Achievement Award at a luncheon in his honor.

====&quot;American Idol&quot;====
In May 2003, near the end of the second season of the Fox TV series &quot;American Idol&quot;, Sedaka appeared as a guest judge and mentor to the five remaining finalists. Third-place finalist Kimberley Locke sang the Sedaka/Greenfield composition &quot;Theme from &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot;&quot;.

Season 2 runner-up Clay Aiken chose Sedaka&#x27;s 1972 song &quot;Solitaire&quot; for his performance. As Aiken explained to the studio and TV audiences, host Ryan Seacrest, and the four regular judges, &quot;Solitaire&quot; had long been one of his mother&#x27;s all-time favorite songs. When she learned that Sedaka was going to be a guest judge and that the finalists would be singing Sedaka&#x27;s songs, she begged Clay to sing &quot;Solitaire&quot;. The performance was uniformly given extraordinarily high praise by the judges. Sedaka told Aiken that he officially passed ownership of the performance of &quot;Solitaire&quot; to Clay, offering to record and produce a single of the song or an entire CD with him.

Although it did not appear on his debut CD itself, Aiken recorded and added &quot;Solitaire&quot; as the B-side to the single &quot;The Way&quot;, whose sales were faltering. &quot;Solitaire&quot; was quickly moved to the A-side, and radio airplay and single and download sales responded immediately. &quot;Solitaire&quot; hit No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Singles Sales chart and was, in fact, the top-selling single for all of 2004. It also hit the Top 5 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100. Sedaka was invited back to &quot;American Idol&quot; to celebrate the success of &quot;Solitaire&quot; several times, as it continued to reach new milestones. Since then, Aiken has mined the Sedaka songbook again, recording a cover of probably Sedaka&#x27;s best-known song, &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard to Do&quot;, on the &quot;deluxe version&quot; of his 2010 CD release, &quot;Tried and True&quot;.

====Amarillo – Guinness World Record====

On a business trip to New York in mid-1971, Harvey Lisberg, who was a longtime fan of Sedaka, asked Don Kirshner if he&#x27;d written anything new. Kirshner took Lisberg to a small room with a piano where Sedaka was already seated, and he tapped out a few songs. One of these was the Sedaka/Greenfield composition &quot;(Is This the Way to) Amarillo?&quot; which Lisberg loved and placed with his artist Tony Christie who recorded and released it in 1971. The song did relatively well on the UK Singles Chart, reaching the Top 20.

Sedaka released the song in the U.S. in 1977 as the shortened &quot;Amarillo&quot;, but it was only a mid-chart entry, peaking just shy of the Top 40.

When interviewed for an &quot;extras&quot; feature for a DVD set of a concert filmed in London on April 7, 2006 (see below), Sedaka jokingly said that he had heard that Christie had retired and was &quot;golfing in Spain.&quot; The sudden revival of &quot;Amarillo&quot; summoned Christie back to the UK for an unexpected return to fame. In early 2006, the song received new life yet again when a dance beat was added and the lyrics were revised to become a novelty hit, released as &quot;Is This the Way to the (England) World Cup?&quot;, to mark the appearance of the England football team at that summer&#x27;s FIFA World Cup finals.

On April 7, 2006, Sedaka was appearing at the Royal Albert Hall and filming for the aforementioned CD/DVD package, when he was interrupted mid-concert by a gentleman who walked onstage from the wings. The planned scenario was that Sedaka was to begin performing &quot;Amarillo&quot;, and after one verse, the audience was to be surprised by the appearance of Christie for an eventual duet. At the interruption, a confused Sedaka asked, &quot;What is this?&quot; The interloper was a representative from Guinness World Records, and he was there to present Sedaka with an award from &quot;Guinness World Records: British Hit Singles and Albums&quot; for composing &quot;(Is This the Way to) Amarillo?&quot;, the most successful UK single of the 21st century (up to that date). After the presentation, Sedaka proceeded into &quot;Amarillo&quot;, Christie entered onstage to an eruption of cheers from the audience, and after the successful duet performance, the two men walked offstage together, triumphantly arm in arm, as the first half of Sedaka&#x27;s concert came to a close.

====New recording contract, new chart success====
Since Sedaka had lost his recording contract in the mid-1980s, he had used his own business, Neil Sedaka Music, to finance the recording, production, and distribution of new CDs and repackaging of his existing catalog of music. Because of ongoing disputes with RCA Records over the ownership of Sedaka&#x27;s original late 1950s/early 1960s hits, in 1991, Sedaka re-recorded those early recordings.

In early 2007, Sedaka signed his first recording contract in nearly two decades with Razor and Tie Records, a small-but-growing, New York-based independent label with a talent roster that also includes Joan Baez, Vanessa Carlton, Foreigner, Joe Jackson, and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The first release was &quot;The Definitive Collection&quot;, a life-spanning compilation of his hits, along with outtakes and songs previously released but unavailable in CD or download format. It debuted in the Top 25 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top 200 Albums chart in May 2007, one of the highest-charting albums of his entire career. It also includes &quot;It Hurts to Be in Love&quot;, Sedaka&#x27;s version of the Gene Pitney hit.

&quot;Waking Up Is Hard to Do&quot; was Sedaka&#x27;s next release with Razor and Tie, hitting the albums chart in May 2009. The CD was a children&#x27;s album that used the melodies of many of Sedaka&#x27;s best-known songs but changed the lyrics to fit the everyday lives of babies and toddlers, along with their parents, grandparents, babysitters, and other caregivers. The CD title is an example. Lastly, &quot;The Music of My Life&quot; entered the albums chart in February 2010 and comprised almost all new material. &quot;Right or Wrong&quot;, co-written with original music partner Howard Greenfield, was done in traditional street-corner, layered doo-wop vocal harmonies with Sedaka overlaying his own voice to achieve the effect for which he was well known in his &quot;early&quot; heyday of the late 1950s and early 1960s. The final track, &quot;You&quot;, has been previously released, but was remastered for this project and is one of several titles dedicated to his wife and career guide of over 50 years, Leba.

A concert performance on October 26, 2007, at the Lincoln Center in New York City paid homage to the 50th anniversary of Sedaka&#x27;s debut in show business. Music impresario (and producer for &quot;The Music of My Life&quot; track &quot;Do You Remember?&quot;) David Foster served as emcee. Other guests included The Captain and Tennille; Natalie Cole; Connie Francis; recording legend and decades-long Sedaka friend and former manager Don Kirshner; and new &quot;Solitaire&quot; &quot;owner&quot; Clay Aiken, among many others. Also in 2007, Donny Osmond released a CD, &quot;Love Songs of the &#x27;70s&quot;, which included a cover of Sedaka&#x27;s 1975 No. 1 hit &quot;Laughter in the Rain&quot;.

During his 2008 Australian tour, Sedaka premiered a new classical orchestral composition entitled &quot;Joie de Vivre&quot; (Joy of Life). Sedaka also toured the Philippines for his May 17, 2008, concert at the Araneta Coliseum.

On September 11, 2010, Sedaka performed to a TV audience at the Hyde Park, London, venue of the &quot;Proms in the Park&quot; for the BBC.

In early 2011, Sedaka recorded two duets (&quot;Brighton&quot; and &quot;The Immigrant&quot;) with singer Jim Van Slyke for Van Slyke&#x27;s Neil Sedaka tribute album, &quot;The Sedaka Sessions&quot;. LML Records released this album in August 2011.

In 2010, Sedaka duetted with West End (London) and Broadway theatre legend Elaine Paige, on their cover of &quot;Make It With You&quot;, from Ms. Paige&#x27;s UK CD release &quot;Elaine Paige and Friends&quot;. The track was originally a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 pop charts for the soft-rock group Bread in 1970. In 2014, Sedaka duetted with Engelbert Humperdinck. The pair recorded the title song from Sedaka&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;The Hungry Years&quot;. The track is from Engelbert&#x27;s UK/USA CD release &quot;Engelbert Calling&quot;.

Also in 2014, Sedaka duetted with up-and-coming Nashville star Mary Sarah (Gross) on Connie Francis&#x27; classic, &quot;Theme from &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot;&quot;, on her all-duets CD &quot;Bridges&quot;. Mary Sarah was also a Season 10 (spring 2016) contestant on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Voice&quot;, and once again relied on Sedaka&#x27;s &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot; for her blind audition. She turned all four chairs around, and ultimately placed seventh in the competition. In 2015, Sedaka duetted on his No. 1 hit from 1974 to 1975, &quot;Laughter in the Rain&quot;, with Steve Tyrell, on Tyrell&#x27;s 2015 album &quot;That Lovin&#x27; Feeling&quot;. In 2014, BBC Four broadcast the documentary, &quot;Neil Sedaka: King of Song&quot;, telling the story of the two distinct periods of success in his career.

On February 1, 2016, Sedaka performed to a sold-out audience in The Villages. Then, on August 12, 2016, Sedaka released his new acoustic album, &quot;I Do It for Applause&quot;, which includes 11 new tracks and a bonus of his first symphony that was debuted in Australia in 2008, &quot;Joie de Vivre (Joy of Life)&quot;; the recording features the London Philharmonia Orchestra.

In April 2020, Sedaka launched a series of free mini-concerts, released through his social media channels, as a method of entertaining his fans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each daily concert features three songs from Sedaka&#x27;s discography. Sedaka paused the series in December due to contracting COVID-19 himself, but resumed on a reduced schedule January 4, 2021, after recovering with no symptoms.

==Personal life==
Sedaka attended Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn, from which he graduated at the age of 17 in 1956.

He married Leba Strassberg in 1962. The couple have a daughter (Dara) and a son (Marc). Dara is a recording artist and vocalist for television and radio commercials who sang the female part on the Sedaka Billboard Top 20 hit duet, &quot;Should&#x27;ve Never Let You Go&quot; from 1980, and &quot;Angel Queen&quot; on the &quot;Queen Millennia&quot; soundtrack. Marc is a Los Angeles–based screenwriter who has three children with his wife, Samantha.

Sedaka&#x27;s nephew, through his marriage to Strassberg, is CNN Politics writer Harry Enten.

Sedaka underwent a procedure to remove a benign skin tumor from his nose in March 2021.

<text>In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, locally convex topological vector spaces (LCTVS) or locally convex spaces are examples of topological vector spaces (TVS) that generalize normed spaces. They can be defined as topological vector spaces whose topology is generated by translations of balanced, absorbent, convex sets. Alternatively they can be defined as a vector space with a family of seminorms, and a topology can be defined in terms of that family. Although in general such spaces are not necessarily normable, the existence of a convex local base for the zero vector is strong enough for the Hahn–Banach theorem to hold, yielding a sufficiently rich theory of continuous linear functionals.

Fréchet spaces are locally convex topological vector spaces that are completely metrizable (with a choice of complete metric). They are generalizations of Banach spaces, which are complete vector spaces with respect to a metric generated by a norm.

==History==

Metrizable topologies on vector spaces have been studied since their introduction in Maurice Fréchet&#x27;s 1902 PhD thesis &quot;Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel&quot; (wherein the notion of a metric was first introduced). 
After the notion of a general topological space was defined by Felix Hausdorff in 1914, although locally convex topologies were implicitly used by some mathematicians, up to 1934 only John von Neumann would seem to have explicitly defined the weak topology on Hilbert spaces and strong operator topology on operators on Hilbert spaces. Finally, in 1935 von Neumann introduced the general definition of a locally convex space (called a &quot;convex space&quot; by him).

A notable example of a result which had to wait for the development and dissemination of general locally convex spaces (amongst other notions and results, like nets, the product topology and Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem) to be proven in its full generality, is the Banach–Alaoglu theorem which Stefan Banach first established in 1932 by an elementary diagonal argument for the case of separable normed spaces (in which case the unit ball of the dual is metrizable).

==Definition==

Suppose formula_1 is a vector space over formula_2 a subfield of the complex numbers (normally formula_3 itself or formula_4). 
A locally convex space is defined either in terms of convex sets, or equivalently in terms of seminorms.

===Definition via convex sets===

A topological vector space (TVS) is called &quot;&quot; if it has a neighborhood basis (that is, a local base) at the origin consisting of balanced, convex sets. The term is sometimes shortened to or .

A subset formula_5 in formula_1 is called
# Convex if for all formula_7 and formula_8 formula_9 In other words, formula_5 contains all line segments between points in formula_11
# Circled if for all formula_12 and scalars formula_13 if formula_14 then formula_15 If formula_16 this means that formula_5 is equal to its reflection through the origin. For formula_18 it means for any formula_19 formula_5 contains the circle through formula_21 centred on the origin, in the one-dimensional complex subspace generated by formula_22
# Balanced if for all formula_12 and scalars formula_13 if formula_25 then formula_15 If formula_16 this means that if formula_19 then formula_5 contains the line segment between formula_30 and formula_31 For formula_18 it means for any formula_19 formula_5 contains the disk with formula_30 on its boundary, centred on the origin, in the one-dimensional complex subspace generated by formula_22 Equivalently, a balanced set is a &quot;circled cone&quot;. Note that in the TVS formula_37, formula_38 belongs to formula_39ball centered at the origin of radius formula_40formula_41, but formula_42 does not belong; indeed, &quot;C&quot; is a cone, but balanced.
# A cone (when the underlying field is ordered) if for all formula_12 and formula_44 formula_45
# Absorbent or absorbing if for every formula_46 there exists formula_47 such that formula_48 for all formula_49 satisfying formula_50 The set formula_5 can be scaled out by any &quot;large&quot; value to absorb every point in the space.
#* In any TVS, every neighborhood of the origin is absorbent. 
# Absolutely convex or a if it is both balanced and convex. This is equivalent to it being closed under linear combinations whose coefficients absolutely sum to formula_52; such a set is absorbent if it spans all of formula_53

In fact, every locally convex TVS has a neighborhood basis of the origin consisting of sets (that is, disks), where this neighborhood basis can further be chosen to also consist entirely of open sets or entirely of closed sets. 
Every TVS has a neighborhood basis at the origin consisting of balanced sets, but only a locally convex TVS has a neighborhood basis at the origin consisting of sets that are both balanced convex. It is possible for a TVS to have neighborhoods of the origin that are convex and yet not be locally convex because it has no neighborhood basis at the origin consisting entirely of convex sets (that is, every neighborhood basis at the origin contains some non-convex set); for example, every non-locally convex TVS formula_1 has itself (that is, formula_1) as a convex neighborhood of the origin.

Because translation is continuous (by definition of topological vector space), all translations are homeomorphisms, so every base for the neighborhoods of the origin can be translated to a base for the neighborhoods of any given vector.

===Definition via seminorms===

A seminorm on formula_1 is a map formula_57 such that

# formula_58 is nonnegative or positive semidefinite: formula_59;
# formula_58 is positive homogeneous or positive scalable: formula_61 for every scalar formula_62 So, in particular, formula_63;
# formula_58 is subadditive. It satisfies the triangle inequality: formula_65

If formula_58 satisfies positive definiteness, which states that if formula_67 then formula_68 then formula_58 is a norm. 
While in general seminorms need not be norms, there is an analogue of this criterion for families of seminorms, separatedness, defined below.

If formula_1 is a vector space and formula_71 is a family of seminorms on formula_1 then a subset formula_73 of formula_71 is called a base of seminorms for formula_71 if for all formula_76 there exists a formula_77 and a real formula_47 such that formula_79

Definition (second version): A locally convex space is defined to be a vector space formula_1 along with a family formula_71 of seminorms on formula_53

====Seminorm topology====

Suppose that formula_1 is a vector space over formula_2 where formula_85 is either the real or complex numbers.
A family of seminorms formula_71 on the vector space formula_1 induces a canonical vector space topology on formula_1, called the initial topology induced by the seminorms, making it into a topological vector space (TVS). By definition, it is the coarsest topology on formula_1 for which all maps in formula_71 are continuous.

It is possible for a locally convex topology on a space formula_1 to be induced by a family of norms but for formula_1 to be normable (that is, to have its topology be induced by a single norm).

=====Basis and subbases=====

An open set in formula_93 has the form formula_94, where formula_95 is a positive real number. The family of preimages formula_96 as formula_58 ranges over a family of seminorms formula_71 and formula_95 ranges over the positive real numbers
is a subbasis at the origin for the topology induced by formula_71. These sets are convex, as follows from properties 2 and 3 of seminorms.
Intersections of finitely many such sets are then also convex, and since the collection of all such finite intersections is a basis at the origin it follows that the topology is locally convex in the sense of the definition given above.

Recall that the topology of a TVS is translation invariant, meaning that if formula_101 is any subset of formula_1 containing the origin then for any formula_46 formula_101 is a neighborhood of the origin if and only if formula_105 is a neighborhood of formula_30; 
thus it suffices to define the topology at the origin. 
A base of neighborhoods of formula_107 for this topology is obtained in the following way: for every finite subset formula_108 of formula_71 and every formula_110 let
formula_111

=====Bases of seminorms and saturated families=====

If formula_1 is a locally convex space and if formula_71 is a collection of continuous seminorms on formula_1, then formula_71 is called a base of continuous seminorms if it is a base of seminorms for the collection of continuous seminorms on formula_1. Explicitly, this means that for all continuous seminorms formula_58 on formula_1, there exists a formula_119 and a real formula_47 such that formula_79 
If formula_71 is a base of continuous seminorms for a locally convex TVS formula_1 then the family of all sets of the form formula_124 as formula_125 varies over formula_71 and formula_95 varies over the positive real numbers, is a of neighborhoods of the origin in formula_1 (not just a subbasis, so there is no need to take finite intersections of such sets).

A family formula_71 of seminorms on a vector space formula_1 is called saturated if for any formula_58 and formula_125 in formula_133 the seminorm defined by formula_134 belongs to formula_135

If formula_71 is a saturated family of continuous seminorms that induces the topology on formula_1 then the collection of all sets of the form formula_138 as formula_58 ranges over formula_71 and formula_95 ranges over all positive real numbers, forms a neighborhood basis at the origin consisting of convex open sets; 
This forms a basis at the origin rather than merely a subbasis so that in particular, there is need to take finite intersections of such sets.

======Basis of norms======

The following theorem implies that if formula_1 is a locally convex space then the topology of formula_1 can be a defined by a family of continuous on formula_1 (a norm is a seminorm formula_145 where formula_146 implies formula_147) if and only if there exists continuous on formula_1. This is because the sum of a norm and a seminorm is a norm so if a locally convex space is defined by some family formula_71 of seminorms (each of which is necessarily continuous) then the family formula_150 of (also continuous) norms obtained by adding some given continuous norm formula_151 to each element, will necessarily be a family of norms that defines this same locally convex topology. 
If there exists a continuous norm on a topological vector space formula_1 then formula_1 is necessarily Hausdorff but the converse is not in general true (not even for locally convex spaces or Fréchet spaces).

=====Nets=====

Suppose that the topology of a locally convex space formula_1 is induced by a family formula_71 of continuous seminorms on formula_1. 
If formula_157 and if formula_158 is a net in formula_1, then formula_160 in formula_1 if and only if for all formula_162 formula_163 
Moreover, if formula_164 is Cauchy in formula_1, then so is formula_166 for every formula_167

===Equivalence of definitions===

Although the definition in terms of a neighborhood base gives a better geometric picture, the definition in terms of seminorms is easier to work with in practice. 
The equivalence of the two definitions follows from a construction known as the Minkowski functional or Minkowski gauge. 
The key feature of seminorms which ensures the convexity of their formula_168-balls is the triangle inequality.

For an absorbing set formula_5 such that if formula_19 then formula_171 whenever formula_8 define the Minkowski functional of formula_5 to be
formula_174

From this definition it follows that formula_175 is a seminorm if formula_5 is balanced and convex (it is also absorbent by assumption). Conversely, given a family of seminorms, the sets
formula_177
form a base of convex absorbent balanced sets.

===Ways of defining a locally convex topology===

Example: auxiliary normed spaces

If formula_178 is convex and absorbing in formula_1 then the symmetric set formula_180 This space is often denoted formula_181

Both examples have the property that any continuous linear map to the real numbers is formula_182 In particular, their dual space is trivial, that is, it contains only the zero functional.

* The sequence space formula_183 formula_184 is not locally convex.

==Continuous mappings==


Because locally convex spaces are topological spaces as well as vector spaces, the natural functions to consider between two locally convex spaces are continuous linear maps. 
Using the seminorms, a necessary and sufficient criterion for the continuity of a linear map can be given that closely resembles the more familiar boundedness condition found for Banach spaces.

Given locally convex spaces formula_1 and formula_186 with families of seminorms formula_187 and formula_188 respectively, a linear map formula_189 is continuous if and only if for every formula_190 there exist formula_191 and formula_192 such that for all formula_193
formula_194

In other words, each seminorm of the range of formula_195 is bounded above by some finite sum of seminorms in the domain. If the family formula_187 is a directed family, and it can always be chosen to be directed as explained above, then the formula becomes even simpler and more familiar:
formula_197

The class of all locally convex topological vector spaces forms a category with continuous linear maps as morphisms.

===Linear functionals===

If formula_1 is a real or complex vector space, formula_199 is a linear functional on formula_1, and formula_58 is a seminorm on formula_1, then formula_203 if and only if formula_204
If formula_199 is a non-0 linear functional on a real vector space formula_1 and if formula_58 is a seminorm on formula_1, then formula_209 if and only if formula_210

===Multilinear maps===

Let formula_211 be an integer, formula_212 be TVSs (not necessarily locally convex), let formula_186 be a locally convex TVS whose topology is determined by a family formula_73 of continuous seminorms, and let formula_215 be a multilinear operator that is linear in each of its formula_151 coordinates. 
The following are equivalent:

# formula_217 is continuous.
# For every formula_218 there exist continuous seminorms formula_219 on formula_220 respectively, such that formula_221 for all formula_222
# For every formula_218 there exists some neighborhood of the origin in formula_224 on which formula_225 is bounded.

<doc id="518850" wikidata="Q453623" url="?curid=518850" title="German destroyer Lütjens">
<text>The German destroyer &quot;Lütjens&quot; was the lead ship of her class, a modified version of the American &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; class, built for the &quot;Bundesmarine&quot; (West German Navy) during the 1960s.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; class was based on a stretched hull modified to accommodate an RUR-5 ASROC Launcher and all their associated equipment. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draft of . They displaced at full load. Their crew consisted of 333 officers and enlisted men.

The ships were equipped with two geared General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four D-V2M water-tube boilers. The turbines were intended to produce to reach the designed speed of . The &quot;Lütjens&quot; class had a range of at a speed of . Unlike their half-sisters, the ships had two macks.

They were armed with two 5&quot;/54 caliber Mark 42 gun forward, one each forward and aft of the superstructure. The ships were fitted with an eight-round ASROC launcher between the funnels. Close-range anti-submarine defense was provided by two triple sets of Mk 32 torpedo tubes. The primary armament of the ships was the Tartar surface-to-air missile designed to defend the carrier battle group. They were fired via the single-arm Mk 13 missile launcher and the ships stowed a total of 40 missiles for the launcher.

==Construction and career==
The ship was named for Admiral Günther Lütjens, who commanded a battlegroup comprising the and the cruiser during Operation Rheinübung (Exercise Rhine). Lütjens was killed when &quot;Bismarck&quot; was surrounded by overwhelming British naval force on 27 May 1941 in the North Atlantic. She was laid down at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine on 1 March 1966 with the hull classification symbol DDG-28. She was launched on 11 August 1967 and commissioned on 22 March 1969.

On 14 September 2001, three days after the terrorist attacks on 11 September, the crew of &quot;Lütjens&quot; manned the rails, and as they approached the destroyers and , they displayed an American flag and a banner reading &quot;We Stand By You.&quot;

After over 30 years of service and a travelled distance of &quot;Lütjens&quot; was decommissioned on 18 December 2003. She was the last steam-powered vessel and the last ship classified as a destroyer of the German Navy.

<text>USS &quot;De Haven&quot; (DD-469) was a of the United States Navy, the first Navy ship named for Lieutenant Edwin J. De Haven USN (1819–1865). &quot;De Haven&quot; was the first &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class ship lost in World War II, having been in commission only 133 days.

&quot;De Haven&quot; was laid down by the Bath Iron Works Corporation at Bath, Maine on 27 September 1941 and launched on 28 June 1942 by Miss H. N. De Haven, granddaughter of Lieutenant De Haven. The ship was commissioned on 21 September 1942, Commander Charles E. Tolman in command.

==Service history==
&quot;De Haven&quot; sailed from Norfolk, Va. and reached Tongatapu, Tonga Islands, 28 November 1942 to escort a convoy of troopships to Guadalcanal to relieve the Marines who had been there since the invasion landings in August. &quot;De Haven&quot; screened the transports off Guadalcanal from 7 to 14 December, then sailed out of Espiritu Santo and Nouméa in the continuing Solomon Islands operations. She patrolled in the waters of the Southern Solomons to stop the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot;, the nightly effort to supply the beleaguered Japanese troops still fighting on the invaded islands, and took part in two bombardments of Kolombangara island during January 1943.

On 1 February 1943, &quot;De Haven&quot; screened six LCTs and a seaplane tender establishing a beachhead at Maravovo on Guadalcanal. While escorting two of the landing craft back to their base in the afternoon, &quot;De Haven&quot; was warned of an impending air attack by Japanese aircraft supporting Operation Ke. She sighted nine unidentified planes and opened fire as six swung sharply toward her. She shot down three of these planes, but not before all six had dropped their bombs. &quot;De Haven&quot; was hit by three bombs and further damaged by a near miss. One bomb hit the superstructure squarely, killing the commanding officer instantly. All was lost after the first hit and the ship began to settle rapidly, sinking in Ironbottom Sound about east of Savo Island. One of the LCTs she had escorted rescued the survivors. &quot;De Haven&quot; lost 167 killed and 38 wounded.

Her wreck was discovered by Robert Ballard in 1992.

==Honors==
&quot;De Haven&quot; received one battle star for her World War II service.

<doc id="518858" wikidata="Q271603" url="?curid=518858" title="Voiceless velar fricative">
<text>The voiceless velar fricative is a type of consonantal sound used in some spoken languages. It was part of the consonant inventory of Old English and can still be found in some dialects of English, most notably in Scottish English, e.g. in &quot;loch&quot;, &quot;broch&quot; or &quot;saugh&quot; (willow).

The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , the Latin letter x. It is also used in broad transcription instead of the symbol , the Greek chi, for the voiceless uvular fricative.

There is also a voiceless post-velar fricative (also called pre-uvular) in some languages, which can be transcribed as [x̠] or [χ̟]. For voiceless pre-velar fricative (also called post-palatal), see voiceless palatal fricative.

Some scholars also posit the voiceless velar approximant distinct from the fricative, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , but this symbol is not suitable in case of the voiceless velar approximant that is unspecified for rounding (the sound represented by the symbol is specified as unrounded), which is best transcribed as , or - see voiced velar approximant. The velar approximant can in many cases be considered the semivocalic equivalent of the voiceless variant of the close back unrounded vowel .

==Features==

Features of the voiceless velar fricative:


==Varieties==

== Occurrence ==
The voiceless velar fricative and its labialized variety are postulated to have occurred in Proto-Germanic, the ancestor of the Germanic languages, as the reflex of the Proto-Indo-European voiceless palatal and velar stops and the labialized voiceless velar stop. Thus Proto-Indo-European *ḱr̥nom &quot;horn&quot; and *kʷód &quot;what&quot; became Proto-Germanic *hurnan and *hwat, where *h and *hw were likely and . This sound change is part of Grimm&#x27;s law.

In Modern Greek, the voiceless velar fricative (with its allophone, the voiceless palatal fricative , occurring before front vowels) originated from the Ancient Greek voiceless aspirated stop in a sound change that lenited Greek aspirated stops into fricatives.

<doc id="518862" wikidata="Q376667" url="?curid=518862" title="Tokyo Express">
<text>The Tokyo Express was the name given by Allied forces to the use of Imperial Japanese Navy ships at night to deliver personnel, supplies, and equipment to Japanese forces operating in and around New Guinea and the Solomon Islands during the Pacific campaign of World War II. The operation involved loading personnel or supplies aboard fast warships (mainly destroyers), later submarines, and using the warships&#x27; speed to deliver the personnel or supplies to the desired location and return to the originating base all within one night so Allied aircraft could not intercept them by day.

==Name==
The original name of the resupply missions was &quot;The Cactus Express&quot;, coined by Allied forces on Guadalcanal, who used the code name &quot;Cactus&quot; for the island. After the U.S. press began referring to it as the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot;, apparently in order to preserve operational security for the code word, Allied forces also began to use the phrase. The Japanese themselves called the night resupply missions , because they took place at night.

==Organization and history== 
Night transportation was necessary for Japanese forces due to Allied air superiority in the South Pacific, established soon after the Allied landings on Guadalcanal and the subsequent establishment of Henderson Field as a base for the &quot;Cactus Air Force&quot; in August 1942. Delivery of troops and material by slow transport ships to Japanese forces on Guadalcanal and New Guinea soon proved too vulnerable to daytime air attack. The Japanese Combined Fleet commander Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto therefore authorized the use of faster warships to make the deliveries at night when the threat of detection was much less and aerial attack minimal.

The Tokyo Express began soon after the Battle of Savo Island in August 1942 and continued until late in the Solomon Islands campaign when one of the last large Express runs was intercepted and almost completely destroyed in the Battle of Cape St. George on November 26, 1943. Because the destroyers typically used were not configured for cargo handling, many supplies were sealed inside steel drums lashed together and simply pushed into the water without the ships stopping; ideally, the drums would float ashore or were picked up by barge. However, many drums were lost or damaged; a typical night in December 1942 resulted in 1500 drums being rolled into the sea, with only 300 recovered.

Most of the warships used for Tokyo Express missions came from the Eighth Fleet, based at Rabaul and Bougainville, although ships from Combined Fleet units based at Truk were often temporarily attached for use in Express missions. The warship formations assigned to Express missions were often formally designated as the &quot;Reinforcement Unit&quot;, but the size and composition of this unit varied from mission to mission.

==Strategic implications==
The Tokyo Express ended up being a lose-lose gambit for the Japanese, because many destroyers were lost during the fifteen months of the Tokyo Express, for no gain. These ships could not be replaced by the stressed Japanese shipyards, and were already in short supply. In addition, they were desperately needed for convoy duty to protect Japanese shipping supplying the Home Islands from the depredations of American submarines.

The Imperial Japanese Navy was caught in a Catch-22, since American airpower from Henderson Field denied the Japanese the use of slow cargo ships. Compared to destroyers, cargo ships were much more economical in fuel usage while having the capacity to carry full loads of troops plus sufficient equipment and supplies, and having efficient cargo loading and unloading equipment. However, they were slow and comparatively unmaneuverable, and thus easily sunk – not merely sending irreplaceable supplies and freighters to the bottom but leaving their increasingly desperate troops unprovisioned and ever less able to fight.

As a result, the Navy was in essence forced to &quot;fight as uneconomical a campaign as could possibly be imagined&quot;, since in using destroyers they had to &quot;expend much larger quantities of fuel than they wanted&quot; considering Imperial Japan&#x27;s disadvantage in oil supply, and this &quot;fuel was used to place very valuable (and vulnerable) fleet destroyers in an exposed forward position while delivering an insufficient quantity of men and supplies to the American meatgrinder on the island&quot;. Even at its best (with only one-fifth of the supplies dropped ever making it to shore) the destroyer strategy amounted to waging a losing war of attrition on land and an extremely expensive rolling naval defeat.

Thereafter, the Japanese increasingly relied on convoys of barges escorted by armored boats to replenish or evacuate their forces. A typical configuration allowing for the transport of 1,000 men, 300 miles, would consist of 2 Soukoutei-class armored boats as escort for 2 special large landing barges (&quot;Toku Daihatsu&quot;), 40 large landing barges (&quot;Daihatsu&quot;), and 15 small landing barges (&quot;Shohatsu&quot;).

==John F. Kennedy and &quot;PT-109&quot;==
John F. Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;PT-109&quot; was lost on a &quot;poorly planned and uncoordinated&quot; attack on a Tokyo Express run on the night of 1-2 August 1943. Fifteen PT boats with sixty torpedoes fired over thirty and did not register a single hit, while &quot;PT-109&quot; was rammed and sunk by the destroyer &quot;Amagiri&quot;, which was returning from her supply run, estimated to be traveling in excess of with no running lights.

==The end of the Tokyo Express on Guadalcanal==
By early February of 1943 the Allies had triumphed on Guadalcanal and had effective control of the area of The Slot that had been used to man and provision it, preventing a highly stressed Japanese military from being able to wage an effort to retake it and its extremely valuable Henderson Airfield. To signify final victory over the Japanese on the island, General Alexander Patch, commander of the Allied land forces on the island, messaged his superior, Admiral William F. Halsey on February 9, 1943, &quot;Tokyo Express no longer has terminus on Guadalcanal.&quot;

<text>D186 &quot;Mölders&quot; was one of three guided-missile destroyers, a modified version of the American , built for the &quot;Bundesmarine&quot; (West German Navy) during the 1960s.

==Design and description==
The Charles F. Adams class was based on a stretched Forrest Sherman-class destroyer hull modified to accommodate an RUR-5 ASROC Launcher and all their associated equipment. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draft of . They displaced at full load. Their crew consisted of 333 officers and enlisted men.

The ships were equipped with two geared General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four D-V2M water-tube boilers. The turbines were intended to produce to reach the designed speed of . The &quot;Lütjens&quot; class had a range of at a speed of . Unlike their half-sisters, the ships had two macks.

They were armed with two 5&quot;/54 caliber Mark 42 gun, one each forward and aft of the superstructure. The ships were fitted with an eight-round ASROC launcher between the funnels. Close-range anti-submarine defense was provided by two triple sets of Mk 32 torpedo tubes. The primary armament of the ships was the Tartar surface-to-air missile system designed to defend a carrier battle group. They were fired via the single-arm Mk 13 missile launcher and the ships stowed a total of 40 missiles for the launcher.

==Construction and career==

On 3 March 1965 Bath Iron Works got the order to build &quot;Mölders&quot; and her keel was laid down on 12 April 1966 with the hull number DDG-29. On 13 April 1967 &quot;Mölders&quot; was launched and christened for Luftwaffe Oberst (Colonel) Werner Mölders by his mother Anne-Marie Mölders. &quot;Mölders&quot; was commissioned on 23 February 1969 into the &quot;1. Zerstörergeschwader&quot; (first destroyer squadron) based in Kiel.

During her 33 years in commission 14,000 sailors served on her under 16 commanders, and she traveled . &quot;Mölders&quot; was decommissioned 28 May 2003 in Wilhelmshaven.

Unlike her sisters and , &quot;Mölders&quot; was preserved and is now on display as museum ship at the &quot;Deutsches Marinemuseum&quot; at Wilhelmshaven, although she was never stationed in Wilhelmshaven during her active career. She is the sole surviving member of the Charles F Adams class destroyers.

<text>Sam Dolgoff (10 October 1902 – 15 October 1990) was an anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist from Russia who grew up, lived and was active in the United States.

== Biography ==
Dolgoff was born in the shtetl of Ostrovno in Mogilev Governorate, Russian Empire (in present-day Beshankovichy Raion, Belarus), moving as a child to New York City in 1905 or 1906, where he lived in the Bronx and in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side where he died. His father was a house painter, and Dolgoff began house painting at the age of 11, a profession he remained in his entire life.

After being expelled from the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League, Sam joined the Industrial Workers of the World in 1922 and remained an active member his entire life, playing an active role in the anarchist movement for much of the century. He was a co-founder of the &quot;Libertarian Labor Review&quot; magazine, which was later renamed &quot;Anarcho-Syndicalist Review&quot; to avoid confusion with America&#x27;s Libertarian Party.

Dolgoff was a member of the Chicago Free Society Group in the 1920s, Vanguard Group member and editor of its publication &quot;Vanguard: A Journal of Libertarian Communism&quot; in the 1930s, and co-founded the Libertarian League in New York in 1954. He wrote articles for anarchist magazines as well as books as the editor of anthologies, some of which are listed below. He was active in many causes, and attended groups like New York&#x27;s Libertarian Book Club regularly.

Dogloff died of congestive heart failure at the age of 88 in 1990.

<text>Michael Berrin (born May 6, 1967), better known by his stage name MC Serch, is an American rapper and record executive. He gained fame as part of the hip hop group 3rd Bass, who were active in the late 1980s and early 1990s and released three studio albums. 

In his solo work, Serch is credited with having discovered American rapper Nas in 1992. Serch introduced the rapper to Columbia Records and executive produced his debut studio album, &quot;Illmatic&quot; (1994).

== Early life and education ==
Serch grew up in Far Rockaway, Queens, New York City. He attended Far Rockaway High School and graduated from Music &amp; Art High School. He is of Jewish descent.

== Career ==

After recording three albums with 3rd Bass—&quot;The Cactus Album&quot; (1989), &quot;The Cactus Revisited&quot; (1990), and &quot;Derelicts of Dialect&quot; (1991)—Serch launched a solo career with &quot;Return of the Product&quot; (1992, Def Jam). The album featured two hit singles: &quot;Here It Comes&quot; (which hit #1 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Rap Tracks chart); and &quot;Back to the Grill&quot; featuring Chubb Rock, Red Hot Lover Tone, and Nas. Serch was the executive producer of Nas’ &quot;Illmatic&quot;.

He also helped to cultivate the rapper O.C. after hearing him on the Organized Konfusion song &quot;Fudge Pudge&quot;, helping him secure a record contract with Wild Pitch Records. In 1995, Serch also mentored the newly formed Non Phixion.

Since retiring from performing, Serch has run a promotions company (Serchlite Music). He appeared in Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Bamboozled&quot; (2000) as a member of the fictitious hip-hop group Mau Maus (played by other real-life hip-hop performers such as Mos Def, Charli Baltimore and Canibus). His character was a white revolutionary who was supposed to be &quot;1/16 black&quot;.

From 2003, he hosted &quot;Serch In The AM&quot; on Detroit urban radio station FM 98 WJLB; he was the first Jewish DJ at that station. MC Serch was dismissed from WJLB in March 2006, reportedly due to a dispute over a Super Bowl weekend party at the club Motor City Live.

Serch also hosted the VH1 reality series &quot;Ego Trip&#x27;s The (White) Rapper Show&quot; which ended in March 2007. On the show he was known for his catchphrase &quot;Woop-WOOP!&quot;. A follow-up show, &quot;Ego Trip&#x27;s Miss Rap Supreme&quot;, debuted in 2008.

Serch has since returned to the radio airwaves in Detroit on the urban station Hot 102.7. Serch has also worked with Hot 102.7&#x27;s youngest intern (The Black Intern) Daniel Berry, and Rucka Rucka Ali (Comedy Music Artist). Serch appeared in some of Rucka Rucka Ali&#x27;s music videos.

In 2018 he gave an interview with DJ Vlad in which he claimed MC Hammer had once taken out a $50,000 contract on Serch&#x27;s life, following a misunderstanding over lyrics.

In May 2021, MC Serch joined VidSig, a live global video platform, as Chief Creative Consultant.

Serch was an executive at HitPiece, a startup creating NFTs of songs that shut down in February 2022 under threat of action by Recording Industry Association of America, which labeled it a &quot;scam operation&quot; and after public criticism by major artists including Wolfgang Van Halen.

<text>The German destroyer D187 &quot;Rommel&quot; was one of three guided-missile destroyers, a modified version of the American , built for the &quot;Bundesmarine&quot; (West German Navy) during the 1960s.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; class was based on a stretched hull modified to accommodate smaller RIM-24 Tartar surface-to-air missiles and all their associated equipment. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draft of . They displaced at full load. Their crew consisted of 333 officers and enlisted men.

The ships were equipped with two geared General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four D-V2M water-tube boilers. The turbines were intended to produce to reach the designed speed of . The &quot;Lütjens&quot; class had a range of at a speed of . Unlike their half-sisters, the ships had two macks.

They were armed with two 5&quot;/54 caliber Mark 42 gun forward, one each forward and aft of the superstructure. The ships were fitted with an eight-round ASROC launcher between the funnels. Close-range anti-submarine defense was provided by two triple sets of Mk 32 torpedo tubes. The primary armament of the ships was the Tartar surface-to-air missile designed to defend the carrier battle group. They were fired via the single-arm Mk 13 missile launcher and the ships stowed a total of 40 missiles for the launcher.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Rommel&quot; was laid down on 22 August 1967 by Bath Iron Works of Bath, Maine with the hull number DDG-30. She was launched on 1 February 1969, and christened &quot;Rommel&quot; by Lucie Maria Rommel, widow of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erwin Rommel. The vessel was commissioned on 2 May 1970, and was added to the &quot;1. Zerstörergeschwader&quot; (first destroyer squadron), based in Kiel. She operated for 28 years.

On 30 September 1998, &quot;Rommel&quot; was decommissioned. The operating licence for the boilers had expired and it was not considered efficient to refit her. She was towed to Wilhelmshaven to be cannibalised for spare parts to support her two sister ships, and . These two vessels continued to serve for five more years. In 2004 the hull of &quot;Rommel&quot; was scrapped in Turkey.

<text>The Shadows of Knight were an American rock band from Chicago, Illinois, that played a version of British blues influenced by their native city. When they began recording in 1965, the band&#x27;s self-description was &quot;the Stones, Animals and the Yardbirds took the Chicago blues and gave it an English interpretation. We&#x27;ve taken the English version of the Blues and re-added a Chicago touch,&quot; to which rock critic Richie Unterberger commented: &quot;The Shadows of Knight&#x27;s self-description was fairly accurate.&quot;

==History==
===1960s===
The band was formed in 1964 as simply the Shadows. In the spring of 1965, the band learned of an already existing British group, the Shadows. Whiz Winters, a friend who worked for their manager, Paul Sampson, in his record shop, came up with the name &quot;The Shadows of Knight&quot; to tie into the British Invasion in music of that time, and because four of the band members attended Prospect High School in Mt. Prospect, Illinois, whose sports team had the name &quot;The Knights&quot;.

Founding members included Jim Sohns (vocals; 1946–2022), Warren Rogers (lead guitar), Norm Gotsch (rhythm guitar), Wayne Pursell (bass guitar), and Tom Schiffour (drums). They released three albums in their first five years of existence. In early Fall 1965, Pursell left the band to attend college and Joe Kelley was recruited to play bass. Kelley would swap bass and lead duties with Rogers in late 1965 at the time of the &quot;Gloria&quot; recordings. Guitarist and vocalist Jerry McGeorge replaced Norm Gotsch in late 1965 after Gotsch joined the U.S. Navy, serving in Vietnam during his tour of duty. David &quot;Hawk&quot; Wolinski, who later worked with Rufus and Chaka Khan, replaced Rogers on bass in late 1966.

After performing in and around Chicago&#x27;s northwest suburbs in 1964 and 1965, The Shadows of Knight became the house band at The Cellar in Arlington Heights, Illinois, owned by Sampson. They attracted more than 500 teenagers every Saturday and Sunday at the &quot;Cellar&quot; for more than six months until Sampson began booking other bands, giving them a break. (A recording of a Shadows of Knight performance at The Cellar was released in 2018 by Sundazed Music as Alive in &#x27;65, showcasing the five original members of the band.) 

A stellar performance in support of the Byrds at Chicago&#x27;s McCormick Place in early summer 1965 attracted the attention of Dunwich Records record producers Bill Traut and George Badonski. During that show, they performed &quot;Gloria&quot; by Van Morrison&#x27;s band Them. The band signed with Dunwich shortly thereafter and recorded &quot;Gloria&quot; as a first effort.

Released in December 1965, &quot;Gloria&quot; received regional airplay. The band had slightly altered the song&#x27;s lyrics, replacing Morrison&#x27;s original &quot;she comes to my room, then she made me feel alright&quot; with &quot;she called out my name, that made me feel alright&quot; after influential Chicago station WLS had banned Them&#x27;s original version. This simple change overcame the prevalent AM radio censorship of the era and got The Shadows of Knight&#x27;s cover version of the song onto the playlist of WLS. The single reached the No. 1 position on the radio station&#x27;s countdown, as well as on local rival WCFL. On the &quot;Billboard&quot; national charts, &quot;Gloria&quot; rose to No. 10. The secondary publication &quot;Cashbox&quot; ranked &quot;Gloria&quot; as high as No. 7. In Canada the song reached No. 8 on the RPM Magazine charts. &quot;Gloria&quot; sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.

The Shadows of Knight soon released the &quot;Gloria&quot; album, followed by the &quot;Back Door Men&quot; LP, in the summer of 1966. Subsequent singles included their version of the Bo Diddley song &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; (which reached No. 39 nationally), &quot;Bad Little Woman&quot; (No. 91), and the powerhouse &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Make You Mine&quot; (No. 90). However, none of these releases approached their initial commercial success. Failure to find a winning follow-up to &quot;Gloria&quot; handicapped the band&#x27;s earning power and led to its disintegration. Tom Schiffour left the band in spring 1967, first to be replaced by a young local fan of the band, Bruce Bruscato. He was subsequently replaced by Tom Morris. The original band fragmented further when McGeorge departed for acid-rock band H.P. Lovecraft, while Kelley left to front his own blues band. Hawk Wolinski also left the band to form Bangor Flying Circus with Schiffour and guitarist Alan De Carlo.

By mid-1967, the only original member of the Shadows of Knight remaining was vocalist Jim Sohns, who trademarked the band name and inherited the groups&#x27;s legacy. In the second generation of the band he was joined by Kenny Turkin on drums and vocals, Steve (Woody) Woodruff on lead guitar and vocals, Dan Baughman on rhythm guitar and vocals, and John Fisher on bass guitar and vocals. This generation of the band would perform together for the next 18 months. Sohns signed the band with Buddah Records in New York. Sohns had hoped to take the band in a British power-rock direction, but the Super K record label pulled them into a more commercial orientation, pairing the band with bubblegum groups such as the 1910 Fruitgum Company and the Ohio Express on tour. In 1969, the second generation Shadows of Knight released &quot;Shake&quot; on Buddha&#x27;s short-lived subsidiary Team Records; the track eventually climbed to No. 46 (No. 37 Canada, December 1968). That same year, without the band&#x27;s knowledge or consent, the unsuccessful update &quot;Gloria &#x27;69&quot; was released by Dunwich.

&quot;Shake&quot; and its B-side, &quot;From Way Out to Way Under&quot; were actually recorded by Sohns and a number of studio musicians, on the understanding that a Shadows of Knight reassembled by Sohns would record a follow-up album. That album, &quot;Shadows of Knight&quot; is today regarded as a distinct recording oddity, being an attempt to mix punk and bubblegum music. From 1960s to 1970s, Chicago jazz rock, blue-eyed soul, blues rock, garage rock scene that included the Shadows of Knight, Chicago, The Buckinghams, the Mauds and The Ides of March.

===1970s–1980s===
The four years after the breakup of the original Shadows were a dark creative period with little financial success. The band&#x27;s repertoire consisted mostly of pop cover songs, which allowed them to survive by playing clubs. The second iteration of the band continued to evolve. Baughman left to pursue a career in metal sculpture. Turkin was replaced in early 1969 by Paul Scarpelli, and in 1970 Jack &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Daniels replaced Woodruff on guitar. The band&#x27;s lineup remained the same for two years. During that time it recorded &quot;I Am the Hunter.&quot; John Fisher was replaced by Jorge Gonzales on bass in 1971, who was subsequently replaced by John Hardy the next year. He was then replaced by studio bassist Don Ferrone.

In 1972, Nuggets was created by Lenny Kaye, and the album included the Shadows of Knight&#x27;s 1966 &quot;Oh Yeah&quot;. Over subsequent decades, Sohns fronted varying incarnations of the group on the oldies circuit. He also spent a period of time reflecting on his future in the music business, choosing to become the road manager of the band Skafish from 1978 to 1980. He would join the band to sing &quot;Gloria&quot; as the band&#x27;s encore.

===1990s===
The Shadows of Knight enjoyed renewed public interest during the 1990s, significantly due to the 1998 release of their first two albums, remastered by Sundazed Music. In 1992, Performance Records (aka &quot;Donewitch&quot; Records) released &quot;The Shadows Of Knight – Live, Featuring &quot;Gloria&quot;&quot;. This was a previously unreleased performance recorded live in Rockford, Illinois, in 1972. The album is also noted as containing &quot;a wonderfully blistering guitar-laced extended version of Willie Dixon&#x27;s &#x27;I Just Want to Make Love to You&#x27;&quot;, which is nearly twelve minutes long. Also in 1992, another live recording, &quot;Raw &#x27;n&#x27; Alive at The Cellar, 1966&quot;, was released by Sundazed Music. As noted by Richie Unterberger, &quot;This is one of the very few live garage band tapes from the mid-&#x27;60s of relatively decent sound quality (considering the standards of the era). The song selection of this set should also please fans of one of the most famed &#x27;60s garage bands, captured here at a club in their home turf of Chicago in December 1966.&quot; In 1994, Rhino Records released &quot;Dark Sides: The Best of The Shadows of Knight&quot;. Unterberger had mixed feelings about this collection, particularly in view of the absence of &quot;I Just Want to Make Love to You&quot;.

===2000s===
In 2006, the Shadows of Knight headlined Little Steven&#x27;s cross-country &quot;Underground Garage&quot; tour with The Romantics. The Shadows also joined Cheap Trick&#x27;s Halloween show (&quot;Cheap Trick or Treat&quot;), along with guest appearances by members of the Romantics and the Charms. This performance was subsequently televised on VH-1 Classic. At shows on the 2006 tour, they were joined onstage at various times by Rick Mullen (of Van Morrison, Commander Cody, Don McLean), Vince Martell (Vanilla Fudge), Mark Stein (Vanilla Fudge), and members of The Romantics. Also in 2006, a CD of new material, &quot;A Knight to Remember&quot;, was released co-produced by Bobby Messano and Lee Brovitz. Messano played all of the guitars and assisted with background vocals on the album.

In 2008, the band toured as part of &quot;The Psychedelic Shack Tour&quot;, which also featured a re-formed Nazz, Vince Martell and, on occasion, Henry Gross. Also in 2008, a new CD was released, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Survivors&quot;, containing a further reworking of &quot;Gloria&quot;.

===2010s–2022===

Joe Kelley died on September 1, 2013, after a brief battle with lung cancer. He was 67.

On August 20, 2016, in celebration of Sohns&#x27; 70th birthday and the 50th anniversary of the release of &quot;Gloria&quot;, a reunion concert took place in Arlington Heights, Illinois, reuniting Sohns with original band members Tom Schiffour, Jerry McGeorge and Hawk Wolinski. A recording of the performance was released in 2020 by Giving Shelter, Produced by Jeff Millar-Sax. 
On May 27, 2020, classic-era members Jimy Sohns and Jerry McGeorge teamed up with producer/musician Michael Weber to release their first new single together in 53 years, &quot;Wild Man.&quot; On November 6, 2020, the record, along with its B-side remake of &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Got You&quot;, was released on Steven Van Zandt&#x27;s Wicked Cool Records and debuted the following week on Sirius XM&#x27;s Underground Garage.
In March 2022, Jimy Sohns released his only solo single in collaboration with Jon Povey (ex-Pretty Things) and the Technicolour Dream, an Italian neo-psychedelic band active from the late 1970s, who released three albums with Twink in 2013–2019. The single includes two garage / psychedelic songs, &quot;Born Again&quot; and &quot;Isis Calling&quot;, both written by Marco Conti and Fabio Porretti of the Technicolour Dream and Jon Povey.

Lead singer and original member James &quot;Jimy&quot; Sohns (born on August 23, 1946, in Chicago) died of complications from a stroke on July 29, 2022, at age 75.

<text>Redbridge Forest Football Club was an English football club, founded in 1979 as Leytonstone &amp; Ilford F.C., which in 1989 merged with Walthamstow Avenue and the following season adopted the name Redbridge Forest. In 1992 the club merged with Dagenham to form the present Dagenham &amp; Redbridge.

==History==
Leytonstone/Ilford F.C. was founded in 1979 by a merger of Leytonstone F.C. (founded in 1886) and Ilford F.C. (founded in 1881).

They were somewhat successful in non-league football, while under the name Leytonstone &amp; Ilford, they were crowned Isthmian League champions during 1981–82. The following season the club finished as runners-up in the same league. At the end of the season, they changed their name to Leytonstone/Ilford F.C..

Another merger was incorporated in 1988 when Walthamstow Avenue were incorporated. Initially there was no name change, and the club won the Isthmian League that season; they were due to be promoted to the Football Conference, but were denied due to ground problems, as the Green Pond Road ground at Walthamstow had already been sold to developers so was not worth upgrading. The club moved to Victoria Road, home of Dagenham F.C., but found the same problem as their ground too was now not up to Conference standard. Leytonstone &amp; Ilford remained in the Isthmian League Premier Division.

===Under the Redbridge Forest name===
For the 1989 season, the name of the club was changed to Redbridge Forest, in preparation for a move to a new site bordering both Redbridge and Waltham Forest borders. However, the move to a new site collapsed and the club remained at Victoria Road. Incidentally, Dagenham and Redbridge Forest were both in the Isthmian League Premier Division for that season and the two matches between landlord and tenant saw 2–2 and 1–1 draws between the clubs, clubs that now play as one. Redbridge Forest won the Isthmian League in 1990–91 and with the ground now passing Conference regulations, the club were now allowed to move up to the Conference for the 1991–92 season.

Redbridge Forest were in the Conference for one year and achieved a seventh-place finish during the 1991–92 season. For the 1992–93 season, they merged with Dagenham (the club whose ground they were sharing) and became Dagenham &amp; Redbridge. The new club reached the English Football League at the end of the 2006–07 as Conference National champions, and won promotion to League One in 2010 via play-offs.

<text>USS Waddell&quot; (DDG-24)was a [[guided missile]] [[destroyer]] in the [[United States Navy]]. She was named for Captain [[James Iredell Waddell]] CSN (1824-1886) who famously captured several American whaling ships just below the Arctic circle and sailed the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans to disrupt American trade. He was the last Confederate officer to surrender which he did in Liverpool, England. The ship was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] in 1964 and saw service in the [[Vietnam War]]. [[Ship decommissioning|Decommissioned]] in 1992, the destroyer was sold to Greece and renamed Nearchos&quot;. From 1992-2003, &quot;Nearchos&quot; served in the Hellenic Navy. In 2006, the ship was used as a target and sunk.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Waddell&quot; was laid down by Todd-Pacific Shipbuilding at Seattle, Washington on 6 February 1962. The ship was launched on 26 February 1963 by Mrs. Howard W. Cannon and commissioned on 28 August 1964.

Following trials from October 1964 to May 1965, the new guided missile destroyer conducted shakedown off the west coast into July, before she participated in anti-aircraft and electronic warfare Exercise &quot;Hot Stove&quot; from 26 August to 3 September. During this time, while serving as plane guard for the aircraft carrier , &quot;Waddell&quot; rescued Comdr. C. H. Peters, whose plane had ditched off the coast of southern California.

On 28 September 1965, &quot;Waddell&quot;—in company with &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and three destroyers, and acting as flagship for Commander, Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 132—departed her home port, Long Beach, California, bound for her first tour of duty in the Western Pacific (WestPac). After stopping at Pearl Harbor, she proceeded on toward the Philippines.

While en route on 31 October, the American task group received a radio message reporting that Japanese merchantman &quot;Tokei Maru&quot; had suffered an explosion on board. Detached to render assistance, &quot;Waddell&quot; sped to the scene and lowered her motor whaleboat containing the squadron doctor. The ship&#x27;s rescue party arrived on board to find three men of &quot;Tokei Maru&quot;″s complement already dead and another seriously burned. After providing medical assistance which saved the man&#x27;s life and having left &quot;Tokei Maru&quot; a supply of medicine to suffice until the Japanese ship could make port, &quot;Waddell&quot; rejoined her consorts.

===Vietnam War===
Only one day after reaching Subic Bay, &quot;Waddell&quot; got underway on 2 November for the coast of Vietnam and her first deployment to &quot;Yankee Station&quot; W-5, in the Tonkin Gulf. On station with Task Unit (TU) 77.0.2 until the 14th, the ship returned to Subic Bay for brief local operations before sailing back to the combat zone to take her post on the northern search and rescue station (SAR) from 29 November to 29 December.

On 7 December, &quot;Waddell&quot; steamed alongside conducting an underway replenishment on the oiler&#x27;s port side; while the destroyer replenished to starboard of the oiler. During the operation, &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot; reported a man overboard; and &quot;Waddell&quot; executed an emergency break-away and doubled back to pick up the man.

Upon completion of this SAR tour, the destroyer sailed via Sasebo to Buckner Bay, Okinawa. She conducted a missile shoot in Ryūkyū waters and then visited Hong Kong. On 31 January 1966, she sailed for Da Nang, en route to a second deployment to the northern SAR area.

At 1410 on 3 February 1966, &quot;Waddell&quot; was notified that a pilot was possibly downed in their vicinity. While proceeding to investigate, the ship noted &quot;surface action&quot; to port and commenced shore bombardment at 1501. Communist guns replied 14 minutes later. &quot;Waddell&quot; then trained her guns on the communist batteries. At 1545, while still shelling the communist gun positions, &quot;Waddell&quot; was straddled by the enemy guns which had found the range. Radical maneuvers enabled the destroyer to retire without damage, and she emerged from the action unscathed.

The following day, after receiving fuel from &quot;Sacramento&quot; in an underway replenishment while on station, &quot;Waddell&quot; collided with &quot;Brinkley Bass&quot;. The damage which &quot;Waddell&quot; sustained forced her to return to the Philippines for repairs.

Back in Vietnamese waters in late February, &quot;Waddell&quot; provided gunfire support in the III Corps operating area from 27 February to 11 March, as part of Task Unit 70.8.9. She then returned—via Subic Bay, Guam, Midway, and Pearl Harbor—to her home port, Long Beach, where she arrived on 8 April.

Following a yard period—during which the ship underwent structural repairs—&quot;Waddell&quot; participated in various fleet and independent exercises off the California coast. Two days after Christmas of 1966, the ship got underway for another WestPac deployment.

Early in 1967, &quot;Waddell&quot; was again engaged off the Vietnamese coastline. From 2 March to 21 May 1967, the ship displayed &quot;exceptional readiness and effectiveness in all tasks assigned,&quot; including gunfire support off South Vietnam; interdiction of North Vietnamese supply traffic along the coast; and gunfire against selected targets in North Vietnam. Coming under hostile fire from shore on one occasion, &quot;Waddell&quot; returned the fire and inflicted maximum damage on enemy shore batteries while emerging without harm. During her second WestPac deployment in Vietnamese waters, the destroyer fired some 2,000 rounds of ammunition while winning the reputation of being &quot;the busiest ship in the Tonkin Gulf&quot; before heading home.

&quot;Waddell&quot; made port at Long Beach on 29 May 1967 and operated briefly off the southern California coast. She entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 4 August and commenced an extensive overhaul which lasted through the end of the year 1967 and into February 1968.

She returned to WestPac that summer—with logistics stops at Pearl Harbor and Midway en route—and arrived at her new home port of Yokosuka, Japan, on 1 August 1968. She conducted three tours on the &quot;gun line&quot; off North and South Vietnam into the fall, as well as one tour as plane guard for the attack carrier strike group based around the carriers and .

On 22 September while operating off the demilitarized zone (DMZ) in company with the cruiser , &quot;Waddell&quot; participated in a SAR operation. At 0145, an attack bomber splashed near the ship. Both crew members had previously ejected from their stricken jet and parachuted to the sea. &quot;Waddell&quot; closed to within of the mouth of the Cua Vet River and rescued the navigator/bombardier, while &quot;St. Paul&quot; picked up the pilot.

After completing an overhaul at Yokosuka toward the end of December 1968, &quot;Waddell&quot; got underway on 7 January 1969, bound for the &quot;gun line.&quot; Between 17 and 30 January, she fired two gunfire support missions in the I Corps area for the Army&#x27;s 101st Airborne Division and one for the 7th and 9th Divisions of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) units. After a quick trip via Buckner Bay to Yokosuka, &quot;Waddell&quot; sped back to the &quot;gun line&quot; in late February and resumed her gunfire support duties on 1 March. There, in the II Corps area, she fired 12 support missions with Task Force &quot;South.&quot; She subsequently conducted 79 more gunfire support missions including 12 for Australian units, 11 for ARVN units, and 15 in support of Operation &quot;Sheridan&quot;—in which the United States Army 101st Airborne and an ARVN regiment participated.

During the first week of April, the downing by North Koreans of a Navy EC-121 Connie early-warning intelligence aircraft in the Sea of Japan greatly increased tension in the Far East. &quot;Waddell&quot; departed the &quot;gun line&quot; at 22 knots, refueled at Buckner Bay, and arrived in the Strait of Tsushima to screen aircraft carriers &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and &quot;Ranger&quot;. She operated in the Sea of Japan until the crisis abated enabling her to head for Yokosuka on the afternoon of 28 April.

Returning to the &quot;gun line,&quot; &quot;Waddell&quot; then lobbed shells at Viet Cong (VC) camps and infiltration points from waters off Phu Quoc Island in the Gulf of Siam in support of Operation &quot;Javelin,&quot; before she was assigned to the Mekong Delta region. There, supporting two ARVN divisions, she conducted 19 bombardments against VC structures, bunkers, rest sites, and supply routes.

Subsequently returning to &quot;Yankee Station,&quot; she screened the carrier in June, as the big carrier conducted strike operations, and returned to waters near the DMZ in mid-July for gunnery support duties.

===Greek service===

&quot;Waddell&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1992, sold to Greece and renamed &quot;Nearchos&quot; after the ancient Cretan admiral Nearchus.

&quot;Nearchos&quot; was decommissioned from the Greek Navy on 3 June 2003 and scuttled as a target on 29 May 2006.

==Honors==
&quot;Waddell&quot; received 11 engagement stars for her service in waters off Vietnam and two Navy Unit Commendations.

<text>Ganong Bros., Limited is a Canadian chocolate and confectionery company based in St. Stephen, New Brunswick. Founded in 1873 by brothers James and Gilbert Ganong, it is the oldest company in its industry in Canada. The family-owned company is in its fifth generation of ownership. Primarily a producer of boxed chocolates and the first to introduce heart-shaped boxes, it now provides many chocolates for Laura Secord stores.

==History==
Ganong Bros. Limited was founded on June 5, 1873, as G. W. Ganong, Commission Merchant, Etc. James H. Ganong had convinced his brother, a teacher and aspiring physician named Gilbert Ganong, to start a grocery store with him in St. Stephen. They advertised their opening in the &quot;Saint Croix Courier&quot;, though the business began failing. They then started selling candy goods, then began manufacturing it themselves after struggling to get suppliers to do business with them. 

In 1884, the brothers&#x27; partnership was dissolved; Gilbert maintained this business, while James left to focus on the St. Croix Soap Manufacturing Company, a soap manufacturer based in the same town.

Ganong Bros. Limited has been one of the Canadian chocolate industry&#x27;s most important companies. Arthur Ganong was the first to make any sort of a wrapped chocolate bar; Ganong began selling the first chocolate bars in 1910. In 1920 they began using the brand name &quot;Pal-o-Mine&quot; for their chocolate bar.

The company also was the first to introduce a heart-shaped box of chocolates in North America. The heart-shaped boxes were originally used for presents over the Christmas season before it also succeeded around Valentine&#x27;s Day.

In 1911, Ganong Bros. purchased the bankrupt White Candy Company in Saint John, New Brunswick and operated a factory there until 1931. In 1988, due to the rising costs of production, a plant was built in Bangkok, Thailand, due to lower labor costs and the close proximity to raw ingredients, and equipment from the St. Stephen factory was shipped there. The majority of the products from this factory is shipped to Canada. In 1990, a new factory was opened on Chocolate Drive, St. Stephen and continues to produce to this day. The old factory eventually became the Chocolate Museum.

In 1997, the company acquired the manufacturing and marketing license for fruit snacks under the Sunkist brand in Canada from Sunkist as well as Lipton.

===Today===
In 2008, for the first time in its history, Ganong selected a president and CEO from outside the family. Doug Ettinger, who had been a senior executive in the food industry for 20 years, was approved by the Ganong board of directors as the top executive of Canada’s oldest candy company.

In 2015, the first female CEO was appointed: Bryana Ganong, part of the fifth generation of Ganongs. David Ganong maintains an advisory role on the company’s board and remains the controlling shareholder.

Company heads
* James H. Ganong, co-founder
* Gilbert W. Ganong, co-founder
* Arthur D. Ganong, president 1917–1957
* R. Whidden Ganong, president 1957–1977
* David A. Ganong, president 1977–2008
* Doug Ettinger, president 2008 to 2012
* David A. Ganong, president 2012 –2014
* Bryana Ganong, president 2014 to present

==Chocolate Museum==

Ganong&#x27;s long history is showcased at its Chocolate Museum (Fr:&quot;Le Musée du Chocolat&quot;) which opened in 1999 in their old factory building in St. Stephen, New Brunswick. Exhibits describe the Ganong brothers and the company, and include hands-on and interactive displays about the process of making chocolate and candies historically and currently, and a display of historic chocolate boxes and antique candy-making equipment. Visitors can also taste chocolate samples. The building also houses the Ganong Chocolatier company store.

In conjunction with the community, the museum co-hosts the annual St. Stephen Chocolate Festival, which has been held since 1985. In 2000 the town was registered as &quot;Canada&#x27;s Chocolate Town&quot;.

==Products==

===Discontinued products===
====Mints====
Ganong Bros.&#x27;s &quot;double-thick&quot; wintergreen mints were, until being discontinued in 2019, manufactured by the company since around 1889. They came in white and pink colours, were particularly larger than the average mint candy, and were coated with a powder. Since the company used traditional &quot;antiquated equipment,&quot; manufacturing the mints had grown to be too costly. In 2021, they were temporarily re-released for a limited time.
====Fruitland Chews====
Fruitland Chews were a line of jelly fruit snacks that Ganong Bros. began manufacturing in 1989, as a means of competing against the dominating Betty Crocker. They used fruit purée to make them. The line was merged in 1997 when Ganong Bros. acquired the rights for Sunkist in Canada.

<text>USS &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; (DDG-22), named for Benjamin Stoddert (1751–1813), Secretary of the Navy from 1798 to 1801, was a &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class guided missile armed destroyer in the United States Navy.

==Construction and career==
She was laid down by the Puget Sound Bridge and Dry Dock Company at Seattle, Washington on 11 June 1962, launched on 8 January 1963 and commissioned at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 12 September 1964.

==1960s==
Over the next six weeks, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; fitted out at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, preparing for a series of weapon, sensor, and communication system tests. The guided-missile destroyer departed Bremerton for the first time on 7 November and, after brief stops at San Francisco and San Diego, arrived at Pearl Harbor to commence acceptance trials.

Since she was primarily designed to provide long-range antiaircraft cover for task forces at sea, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; conducted a two-month evaluation of her TARTAR antiaircraft missile system, concluding with a test firing off Kauai, Hawaii, in early February 1965. Other tests – including gunnery, torpedo, and engineering exercises – helped the crew tie her antisubmarine, antiair, and communications gear into a single integrated system. In May, the warship entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a two-month maintenance period. In July, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot;&#x27;s crew took her through shakedown training, carrying out a variety of operational evolutions – from the complex tracking of aircraft and submarines, to underway refueling, down through the simple but important tasks of anchoring ship – under the watchful eyes of the Fleet Training Group, Pearl Harbor. Upon completing these exams, the warship officially joined the Pacific Fleet in August 1965.

Assigned to Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 112, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; conducted local operations in Hawaiian waters through October, when she began preparations for her first tour of duty with 7th Fleet in the western Pacific. Underway with &quot;Hancock&quot; (CV-19) in late November, she made a brief stop at Subic Bay in the Philippines before proceeding to the South China Sea for combat operations off Vietnam.

Upon arrival at &quot;Yankee Station&quot; on 16 December, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; joined Task Force (TF) 77 in support of Operation Rolling Thunder. This naval air campaign, begun the previous March, was intended to interdict North Vietnam&#x27;s logistical pipeline through Laos and across the demilitarized zone (DMZ), cutting the flow of munitions and supplies to the Viet Cong in South Vietnam. The surface Navy&#x27;s companion campaign – Operation Sea Dragon – supported this effort by targeting communist supply craft, shelling coastal batteries and radar sites, and bombarding coastal infiltration routes. Over the next six weeks, the guided-missile destroyer screened Hancock – providing antisubmarine and antiair protection for the carrier and carrying out planeguard services during flight operations. She also performed radar control duties to assist strike and combat air patrol (CAP) aircraft returning to the carrier. On 4 and 5 January 1966, in a change of pace from earlier tasks, the guided-missile destroyer also fired her 5-inch guns against Viet Cong targets ashore.

Released from TF 77 on 22 January 1966, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; proceeded north, arriving at Yokosuka, Japan, on the 28th. The warship spent a week of alongside &quot;Isle Royale&quot; (AD-29) to repair a broken steam blower before departing Japan on 6 February to return to the South China Sea. Six days later, the guided-missile destroyer resumed duty in TF 77 screening Hancock and remained so employed until setting out for the Philippines on 5 March. &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; arrived at Subic Bay on the 7th for a five-day upkeep period alongside &quot;Ajax&quot; (AR-6). She then sailed to Hong Kong on 12 March for six days of rest and recreation. The warship returned to the South China Sea and rejoined TF 77 late that month. During the next two weeks, the guided-missile destroyer conducted radar picket duty in the Gulf of Tonkin before being relieved by &quot;Topeka&quot; (CLG-8). Steaming to Subic Bay on the 12th, she then began preparing for a visit to Australia and New Zealand.

Departing Subic Bay on 17 April, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; crossed the equator north of the Admiralty Islands and moored at Sydney, Australia, on 29 April. During the next three weeks her crew took part in the annual &quot;Coral Sea Celebration&quot; – in honor of the May 1942 Allied naval victory – and visited Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne in Australia as well as Wellington, New Zealand. Underway for Hawaii on 22 May, the guided-missile destroyer arrived at Pearl Harbor, via Suva in the Fiji Islands, on 30 May.

Except for a brief trip to Honolulu, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; remained in port until 16 July when she put to sea to participate in the Gemini 10 capsule recovery operation. Then, from 25 July to 5 August, the warship conducted several antisubmarine exercises in Hawaiian waters. She returned to mid-ocean operations on 16 August to participate in the recovery of an unmanned Apollo capsule. After a fuel stop at Kwajalein in the Marshalls on the 27th, the guided-missile destroyer returned to Pearl Harbor on 2 September. In addition to a limited availability alongside &quot;Prairie&quot; (AD-15), the warship divided the remainder of the year between various service inspections and local operations out of Pearl Harbor.

These local operations – which included shore bombardment, carrier screening, and ASW exercises – continued into early 1967 as the crew prepared for another 7th Fleet deployment. During this time, her engineers and technicians busied themselves maintaining and improving the warship&#x27;s complex electronic and fire-control systems, a task abetted by a two-week availability alongside &quot;Frontier&quot; (AD-25) in mid-February.

After a final hull cleaning at Pearl Harbor in late March, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; got underway for the Far East on 6 April. The guided-missile destroyer crossed the central Pacific; and, after a short liberty at Yokosuka, Japan, the crew took the warship south to Subic Bay, arriving there on 23 April. Underway the following day, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; met &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; (CVA-31) in the Gulf of Tonkin on the 27th. Later that same day, she joined &quot;Saint Paul&quot; (CA-73) and &quot;Ault&quot; (DD-698) for a &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; patrol; and the task unit prowled the North Vietnamese coast at the 19th parallel, searching for enemy waterborne logistics craft. Early on 5 May, the warships found two such craft, sinking one with gunfire and damaging the other. That afternoon, the trio carried out a preplanned bombardment mission off North Vietnam. This pattern – small-craft searches in the morning followed by shore bombardment missions later in the day – became the daily routine of &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot;&#x27;s later &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; patrols.

Following a diversion to Subic Bay on 7 May to fix a broken forced-draft blower, the guided-missile destroyer rejoined &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; on 16 May for 10 days of planeguard duty. Steaming on her second &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; patrol on 26 May, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; came under enemy fire for the first time later that day. A North Vietnamese coastal battery unexpectedly opened fire, forcing her to shift fire onto the battery, to commence weaving, and to clear the area. During this patrol, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; also rescued the pilot who parachuted from a stricken Air Force F4C &quot;Phantom&quot; that crashed at sea on 30 May (the WSO was rescued by the USS &quot;Blue&quot; (DD-744)) and provided gunfire protection during the helicopter rescue of an Air Force F-105 &quot;Thunderchief&quot; pilot on 4 June. Returning to &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; the next day, the guided-missile destroyer alternated planeguard duties with &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; patrols through 12 July. At one point on 26 June, enemy counterbattery fire fell close enough to spray the ship with shell fragments, but the resulting damage was light and was quickly repaired. Next came a week of PIRAZ duty followed by four days of gunline operations, after which &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; headed to Hong Kong for a week of rest and recreation. After an upkeep period at Subic Bay, the guided-missile destroyer returned to &quot;Yankee Station&quot; on 9 August. Once again, she alternated between carrier planeguard services and gunline duties through the end of the month. A boiler tube failure on 4 September, however, forced the warship to proceed to Yokosuka for temporary repairs.

Departing Japan on 21 August, she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 29 August, and spent the remainder of the year undergoing boiler repairs, conducting post-deployment maintenance, and preparing for various service inspections. This routine was broken only by a few days of underway combat training with &quot;Jenkins&quot; (DD-447) and &quot;Pickerel&quot; (SS-524) in mid-December. On 20 December, the guided-missile destroyer fired two Tartar missiles at the hulk of the former &quot;Fessenden&quot; (DE-142) about south of Oahu. The old escort was damaged by one missile shot and was later sunk by combined gun and torpedo fire. It was during these exercises that the crew learned that &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; had earned a meritorious unit commendation for the previous summer&#x27;s combat operations in Southeast Asia.

The guided-missile destroyer continued local operations out of Hawaii until 5 March 1968 when she moved into the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard to begin a maintenance overhaul. Upon completion of these repairs on 29 August, the warship conducted four weeks of weapons system and sensor calibration tests. Departing Pearl Harbor on 1 October, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; steamed to San Diego, mooring there on the 7th. The next day, the warship began two weeks of training operations in the waters off southern California. Following a missile-firing exercise on the 24th, she put into Redwood City, California, for a port visit on 25 October. After departing there on the 29th, the warship returned home to Pearl Harbor on 2 November and spent the remainder of the year in port.

As part of her final post-overhaul refresher training, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; stood out of Pearl Harbor on 13 January 1969 for local operations with &quot;Enterprise&quot; (CVAN-65) and &quot;Rogers&quot; (DD-876). Early the next day, while she operated about nine miles (14 km) away, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot;&#x27;s crew saw a plume of black smoke rise from the carrier. The guided-missile destroyer closed the smoking carrier – which had suffered a severe flight deck fire – to assist firefighting efforts and search for survivors. By late afternoon, she had recovered one body from the sea and set course for Pearl Harbor.

On 20 January, the guided-missile destroyer began tactical exercises in preparation for &quot;STRIKEX 1-69,&quot; a fleet exercise to be held the following month. Underway from Pearl Harbor on 10 February, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; conducted two weeks of screening, antiair warfare, gunnery, and antisubmarine exercises off San Diego. After these successful maneuvers, she loaded 10 Standard and 24 Tartar missiles at the ammunition depot at Concord, Calif., and returned to Hawaii. There, she moored alongside &quot;Isle Royal&quot; (AD-29) in Pearl Harbor for three weeks of boiler tube repairs in preparation for another western Pacific deployment.

On 14 April, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; loaded a final pallet of 5-inch ammunition before steaming northwest toward Yokosuka. One day after a brief fuel stop at Midway Island, however, the warship suffered yet another boiler tube failure. This did not prevent regular operations; however, and the guided-missile destroyer arrived in Japan on the 24th. The next day, after North Korean fighters shot down a Navy EC-121 reconnaissance plane over the Sea of Japan, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; put to sea for emergency operations in the Yellow Sea. During the tense days that followed, the warship&#x27;s duties included antiair early warning, carrier screening, and electronic intelligence gathering to pinpoint radar and other installations in the Shandong province of eastern China.

When the crisis abated in mid-May, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; turned south, visiting Singapore and spending a day on &quot;Yankee Station,&quot; before mooring at Subic Bay on 1 June. Fitted out with specialized reconnaissance equipment, the warship steamed to the Sea of Japan and relieved &quot;Dale&quot; (DLG-19) as Pacific Area Reconnaissance Program (PARPRO) picket ship on 4 June. The guided-missile destroyer, aside from a few upkeep periods at Sasebo, collected intelligence off the Korean peninsula for the next eight weeks. She moored at Yokosuka on 8 August, unloaded the PARPRO equipment, and then set off south for combat operations on the 10th. After a week of liberty in Hong Kong, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; reported to the gunline off South Vietnam on 22 August. There, she carried out fire missions in the Chu Lai area during the day and provided harassment and interdiction fire from Danang harbor during the night. During four weeks of operations, air and ground spotters directed her guns at enemy supply points, troop concentrations, rocket sites, and infiltration routes; and, by mid-September, she had fired over 5,000 5-inch rounds at these and other targets. To guard against enemy underwater swimmer attacks while at anchor in Danang harbor, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot;&#x27;s crew assisted her marine sentries by frequently dropping concussion grenades in the water.

Departing Danang on the 18th, the warship steamed to Yokosuka for a second PARPRO cruise in the Sea of Japan. These duties included the difficult task of marshaling, routing, and refueling aircraft during large-scale intelligence gathering missions near North Korea. Relieved by &quot;Halsey&quot; (DLG-23) in mid-October, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; unloaded her PARPRO equipment and sailed for Pearl Harbor on 19 October. During the transit, however, a typhoon moved across her track, forcing the warship to reverse course; and she did not arrive in Pearl Harbor until 1 November.

==1970s==
The guided-missile destroyer remained in port until 12 January 1970, when she got underway for a three-day exercise at the Barking Sands Tactical Underwater Range (BARSTUR). The warship conducted a second such training mission between 9 and 13 February, firing exercise RUR-5 ASROC rockets and torpedoes at underwater targets both times. In addition to putting to sea for routine training, she also did so to serve as standby ship for the Apollo 13 recovery mission. In May, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; conducted a very successful nuclear submarine detection and tracking exercise with &quot;Epperson&quot; (DD-719), &quot;Knox&quot; (DE-1052), and &quot;Sargo&quot; (SSN-583). At the end of a short availability alongside &quot;Bryce Canyon&quot; (AD-36), the guided-missile destroyer passed her pre-deployment inspections in early June before joining the annual summer antisubmarine warfare exercise – conducted by American, Canadian, New Zealand, and Japanese warships – off Pearl Harbor at the end of the month. She followed up this exercise with a final tender availability in mid-July.

On 1 August, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; sailed for the western Pacific in company with &quot;Goldsborough&quot; (DDG-20); and, after stopping for fuel at Midway and Guam, the two warships arrived in Subic Bay on the 15th. &quot;Stoddert&quot; then moved on to &quot;Yankee Station&quot; where she provided planeguard and screen services for &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; between 22 and 30 August. The guided-missile destroyer then headed south for Indonesia, held &quot;a rousing shellback initiation&quot; when she crossed the Equator on 3 September and entered Surabaya harbor for a goodwill visit on the 4th. Departing Java on 7 September, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; traced a northerly course between Borneo and Celebes and arrived back at Subic Bay on the 11th.

Following a short upkeep period, the guided-missile destroyer headed for Danang and a tour on the northern search and rescue station (SAR) in the Gulf of Tonkin. Relieving (DLGN-25) on 17 September, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; provided continuous radar and communications services for barrier combat air patrol (BARCAP) operations over the next 25 days. She then headed to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, where her crew received four days of liberty. Over the next five weeks, &quot;Stoddert&quot; conducted two more patrols on the north SAR station, the second of which was interrupted by a small fire in the forward fireroom. Although damage was minimal, the warship sailed to Sasebo, Japan, for minor repairs alongside &quot;Hector&quot; (AR-7). To make matters worse, she suffered another setback when a boiler pipe cracked on the return voyage, and she diverted to Subic Bay for repairs.

The warship finally returned to South Vietnam on the 13th, when she stood to on the gunline off Chu Lai. Once there, the warship settled into a pattern of sporadic call-fire missions during the day and night harassment and interdiction fire after dark. Over the next two weeks, her gun crews fired 2,200 rounds at targets ashore. Sailing for Hong Kong on 29 December, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot;&#x27;s crew closed the year with liberty in that city. Underway again on 5 January 1971, the guided-missile destroyer commenced a final three days of lifeguard duty on &quot;Yankee Station&quot; before sailing for home on the 15th. After stops at Taiwan, Guam, and Midway, she finally returned to Pearl Harbor on 5 February.

Following preparations for a second shipyard overhaul – during which time &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; was reassigned to Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 33 – she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on 17 May. The warship received improvements to her missile and gun systems, and much-needed repairs to her hull, sonar dome, and engineering spaces. With shipyard work completed on 17 September, the crew began refresher training on 13 October. In the evening of 29 October, however, a fire broke out in sonar control in the forward part of the warship. In the darkness and heavy rain, it took damage control teams and the shipyard fire department just over four hours to extinguish the blaze. The crew then spent the next six weeks helping shipyard workers repair the fire damage and get the warship&#x27;s ASW systems back in battery. It was not until 13 January 1972 that &quot;Stoddert&quot; could begin two months of refresher training and other local operations.

The warship finally got underway for deployment on 25 March, arriving in Subic Bay via Midway and Guam on 7 April. The next day, she sailed for the Tonkin Gulf and commenced gunline operations upon arrival off Vietnam on the 10th. She joined other 7th Fleet units in heavy attacks against North Vietnamese military units pushing south along the coast, firing numerous bombardment missions against enemy troops and tanks advancing towards Hue. Four days later, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; joined Task Unit (TU) 77.1.0 for Operation &quot;Freedom Train&quot; – a series of strikes against enemy forces and their logistical infrastructure in North Vietnam.

After rearming from ammunition ships &quot;Pyro&quot; (AE-24) and &quot;Haleakala&quot; (AE-25) early on 17 April, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; joined &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; (CLG-5) for a raid on Vinh, North Vietnam. As the warships closed the port, &quot;Stoddert&quot;&#x27;s electronic warfare unit registered signals from an enemy fire-control radar, followed almost immediately by the launch of two surface-to-surface missiles. Fortunately, both of the missiles missed her; one burst 50 yards to starboard while the other exploded well astern. When enemy gunfire started falling close aboard, including several air bursts that sprayed shell fragments near the warship, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; returned double salvos commencing an inconclusive gun duel that lasted about 13 minutes.

Over the next week, the guided-missile destroyer continued strikes against coastal targets, including daily bombardments of the shore as far north as Thanh Hoa. North Vietnamese shore batteries repeatedly took her under fire and finally scored on 23 April when a shell struck &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; forward in the windlass room. Although put out quickly, the resulting fire destroyed the medical storeroom and the degaussing cable. Returning to gunline duty shortly thereafter, &quot;Stoddert&quot; steered south and provided defensive fire for South Vietnamese (ARVN) forces ashore – at one point firing 1,009 rounds in a 24-hour period.

After a two-week repair and refitting period at Subic Bay between 12 and 26 May, she reentered the Tonkin Gulf on the 29th for more missions against the enemy&#x27;s coastal logistics pipeline. Once American mines shut down the major North Vietnamese harbors, many Chinese communist merchant ships sought refuge in strategic lagoons and inlets whence their cargoes were ferried ashore. One of the guided-missile destroyer&#x27;s missions was to search out and destroy the small ferry craft and any nearby supply caches. On the night of 10 and 11 June, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; closed one such merchant ship, firing on several small craft trying to make a run for shore. When she hit one, and its crew abandoned ship; &quot;Stoddert&quot; sent a boarding party to inspect the sampan. The craft – loaded with seven tons of rice – was later sunk by 5-inch gun and machinegun fire.

Resuming gunline operations on the 14th, the warship fired at enemy troop formations attacking ARVN troops, helping to stall and then repulse this communist thrust into South Vietnam. During one such mission, at 09:10 on 26 June, the forward 5-inch mount suffered a misfire which left a live round hung up in the barrel. Sadly efforts to extract the live shell failed when it exploded, killing two sailors outright and mortally wounding two others. The blast also heavily damaged the gun mount and nearby living spaces. Departing immediately for Subic Bay, the guided-missile destroyer spent the next month in port, replacing the wrecked gun mount and repairing other damage.

According to the ship&#x27;s Deck Logs, from April till the end of June when the gun mount
incident occurred, 10,476 rounds were fired. Many were not logged or recorded due to the intense combat situations.

Arriving back in the Tonkin Gulf on 30 July, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; spent the next three weeks conducting fire missions with TU 70.8.9 off North Vietnam. At this point, South Vietnamese forces had taken Quang Tri City, driving North Vietnamese forces back toward the DMZ; and the naval campaign against the North began to wind down. Coincidentally, &quot;Stoddert&quot;&#x27;s deployment drew to a close at about the same time, and she headed for home on 27 September, mooring in Pearl Harbor on 6 October after a quick transit. Three days later, she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a much needed 30-day standdown.

&quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; remained in the Hawaiian area for the next seven months, conducting routine training operations in preparation for her next 7th Fleet deployment. During this time, a cease-fire agreement was signed in Paris on 27 January 1973, and American forces in South Vietnam began to withdraw. Underway for the Far East on 14 May, &quot;Stoddert&quot; stopped at Yokosuka, Japan, and Kaohsiung, Taiwan, before finally arriving off South Vietnam on 9 June. With combat operations over, the warship helped enforce the terms of the cease fire while on PIRAZ and antiair warfare picket duty in the Gulf of Tonkin.

Following liberty at Hong Kong in early August and two weeks of repairs at Subic Bay, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; received orders to sail for the Gulf of Thailand in response to a domestic crisis in Thailand. She arrived in the gulf on 29 August and operated for three days with Task Group (TG) 76.4, the contingency force assembled in case Americans had to be evacuated from Thailand. Once the crisis eased, &quot;Stoddert&quot; returned to the Gulf of Tonkin. Arriving on station on 11 September, the guided-missile destroyer spent the next six weeks patrolling off Vietnam. Her only diversion came in mid-October, when the warship conducted antisubmarine tactical training in the Subic Bay operating area. Then, on 30 October while steaming near Singapore to avoid a typhoon in the Gulf of Tonkin, she suffered a boiler breakdown which forced her back to Subic Bay.

Following three weeks of repairs, the warship sailed for Hawaii, arriving in Pearl Harbor, via Guam and Midway, on 7 December. Upon her return home, the guided-missile destroyer was greeted by a shrinking defense budget, lack of spare parts, and a shortage of fuel oil – the latter caused by the October 1973 Arab oil embargo – all of which cut back the operating tempo of the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s surface ships. In response, the Navy concentrated on improving overall operational readiness, a routine markedly different from previous training which had concentrated on preparing warships for combat operations off Vietnam. &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; spent the first three months of 1974 participating in a series of fleet-wide inspections and maintenance programs. She remained in the Pearl Harbor area through October, engaged in extensive propulsion repairs, improving her maintenance procedures, and conducting a few local training operations.

On 2 November, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; got underway for her sixth deployment to the Far East. After a stop at Midway to refuel, the guided-missile destroyer arrived at Yokosuka on the 12th. After putting to sea four days later, she conducted ASW operations with &quot;Sailfish&quot; (SS-572) near Okinawa before sailing for Jinhae, South Korea. Arriving at that port on 25 November, the warship then participated in a three-day antisubmarine operation called Exercise &quot;Tae Kwon Do IV.&quot; After a two-week repair stop at Yokosuka in early December and a holiday port visit to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, she ended the year at Subic Bay.

In response to the growing Soviet Navy presence in the Indian Ocean, several American warships received orders to &quot;show the flag&quot; in the region. On 7 January 1975, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; got underway for the Indian Ocean in company with Enterprise. The warships conducted four weeks of training operations at sea before visiting Mombasa, Kenya, between 5 and 9 February. The task force sailed back to the Pacific in mid-February and arrived at Subic Bay on the 28th.

After four weeks of liberty and repairs, the warship was placed on 48-hour alert following the success of the North Vietnamese &quot;Easter&quot; offensive in South Vietnam. Two days later, on 5 April, the guided-missile destroyer sailed for Vung Tau, South Vietnam. Over the next two weeks, she cruised offshore with an amphibious ready group (ARG) and covered three Military Sealift Command (MSC) ships sent to the Vung Tau area on the 23d for evacuation duty. Soon the situation worsened, and the departure of Americans and South Vietnamese from Saigon began on 29 April. The guided-missile destroyer covered helicopter and boat lifts of refugees in the Vung Tau area. Then, on 3 May, she sailed to the location of a sinking South Vietnamese naval ship and rescued 19 people, including one woman and four children. Later that same day, the warship took on another 158 refugees picked up by a Korean fishing vessel.

With the end of the evacuation after the fall of Saigon, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; sailed for Hawaii on 9 May, arriving at Pearl Harbor, via Guam and Midway, on the 21st. The warship spent the summer conducting local operations and preparing for a regular overhaul, which she began at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on 1 October. Shifted out of drydock on 6 February 1976, she conducted a long series of full-power runs and sea trials before finishing her 10-month overhaul on 17 August. The crew then spent the remainder of the year conducting training evolutions, various inspections, and helicopter flight deck certifications. On 17 February 1977, the guided-missile destroyer got underway for &quot;RIMPAC 77,&quot; a multinational naval exercise held in the Hawaiian Islands.

After finishing this exercise on 1 March, she sailed west for her first western Pacific cruise in almost two years. The end of the Vietnam War two years earlier meant that the guided-missile destroyer conducted different operations than during her previous deployments to the Far East. Instead of antiair or gunline combat operations aimed at the North Vietnamese, the warship concentrated on training to counter the threat of Soviet nuclear-powered submarines and guided-missile warships to the western Pacific region. After a stop in the Philippines in late March, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; steamed for Okinawa on 1 April and thence to the waters off Japan and South Korea for a series of exercises. She carried out an ASW exercise against &quot;Barb&quot; (SSN-596) on 6 April, a &quot;war-at-sea&quot; exercise with Coral Sea on the 20th, and another ASW drill with &quot;Sailfish&quot; on 5 May before returning to Subic Bay on the 17th. Over the next eight weeks, &quot;Stoddert&quot; trained in Philippine waters, practicing underway replenishment and other drills. On 6 July, she escorted Coral Sea north to Okinawa, and then participated in &quot;MissileEx 4-77&quot; before putting into Pusan, South Korea, on the 20th. After a week of liberty, she joined elements of the South Korean Navy for ASW exercise &quot;Tae Kwon Do&quot; on 30 July. The guided-missile destroyer then steamed south, stopping at Hong Kong in mid-August before returning to Subic Bay on the 21st.

For her trip home, which began on 6 September, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; detoured south, crossing the equator on the 10th, and mooring at Fremantle, Australia, on 17 September. Following a five-day port visit, the warship sailed on to Melbourne, Australia, and to Dunedin, New Zealand, before arriving at Pago Pago, American Samoa, on 14 September. Underway the next day, the warship visited Western Samoa before proceeding on to Hawaii, to arrive in Pearl Harbor on the 22d. She spent the remainder of the year engaged in post-deployment leave and upkeep. Starting on 9 January 1978, &quot;Stoddert&quot; began eight months of local operations in Hawaiian waters. These evolutions included several firings on the Pacific Missile Range, highlighted by the successful shootdown of two MQM 74C drones by RIM 66A Standard missiles on 29 July.

Following a series of inspections and ship surveys, the warship got underway for the South Pacific on 22 September. After crossing the equator on the 28th, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; anchored at Funafuti, Tuvalu, on 29 September. The next day, she fired a 21-gun salute in recognition of that country&#x27;s independence. Proceeding westward on 2 October, the warship stopped at Suva, Fiji Islands, on the 4th; visited Cairns, Australia, on 10 October; and rendezvoused with &quot;Constellation&quot; (CV-64) south of Guam on the 21st. Delayed by the need to evade a typhoon near the Philippines, the warships did not put into Subic Bay until 30 October. Over the next seven weeks, &quot;Stoddert&quot; conducted operations similar to those of her most recent deployment. Attached to the &quot;Midway&quot; (CV-41) task group, she provided screen services to the carrier as the task group cruised as far south as Pattaya, Thailand, and as far north as Kyūshū, Japan. After arriving at the latter place on 22 December, she ended the year moored at the Naval Ordnance Facility, Sasebo.

Shifting to Yokosuka on 7 January 1979, the warship received four weeks of repairs there at the Naval Ship Repair Facility. &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; then steamed to Okinawa on 10 February to participate in an antiair warfare exercise called &quot;BuzzardEx 1–79.&quot; Moving on to Subic Bay, the guided-missile destroyer provided planeguard services for &quot;Constellation&quot; (CV-64) through the end of the month. Departing Philippine waters on 7 March, the warship returned to Pearl Harbor on the 19th to begin a seven-week maintenance availability.

==1980s==

Continued boiler trouble kept the guided-missile destroyer in port, save for a few local operations, for the remainder of the year. Then, following a series of tests and inspections, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; commenced a major overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on 3 January 1980. After five months in drydock, she moved to a berth for continued industrial work; and it was not until 30 November that the guided-missile destroyer got underway for her first sea trials. The crew spent the next five months putting the warship through full power exams, sonar tests, and weapons system acceptance trials. During the latter, on 31 March 1981, she successfully fired six Standard missiles on the Pacific missile range. The warship then conducted training and other local operations out of Pearl Harbor through the summer and into the fall. On 19 October, she set out for San Francisco, arriving there on the 29th. After a week of liberty, the guided-missile destroyer cruised south to San Diego, mooring at the naval station on 6 November. &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; then participated in Exercise &quot;ReadiEx 1-82&quot;, the highlight of which was a missile firing exercise held on 23 November. Steaming to Hawaii the next day, she moored alongside &quot;Jason&quot; (AR-8) in Pearl Harbor on 1 December for voyage repairs.

On 22 February 1982, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; departed Hawaii for her ninth western Pacific cruise. After a brief stop at Guam on 6 March, she proceeded on to the Philippines. While en route to Subic Bay, the warship conducted both antisubmarine and antiair warfare exercises, an underway routine she would continue throughout this deployment. Following a week in Subic Bay, the guided-missile destroyer steamed to Korea and, between 28 and 30 March, participated in amphibious Exercise &quot;Team Spirit 82.&quot; She then sailed between Hong Kong, Subic Bay, and Yokosuka before anchoring in Shimoda, Japan, on 15 May. In the latter port, she took part in the Black Ship Festival, commemorating Commodore Matthew C. Perry&#x27;s opening of Japan to foreign trade in 1854. &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; returned to Subic Bay on the 24th.

Leaving the Philippines on 2 June, the guided-missile destroyer sailed to Pattaya, Thailand, anchoring there on the 6th. That same day, tension between the Soviet Union and the West increased after Israel invaded Lebanon. International friction notwithstanding, the warship joined the previously scheduled exercise &quot;Cobra Gold 82&quot; in the Gulf of Thailand on the 7th. Her participation included naval gunfire support for an amphibious landing exercise and ASW operations with three Royal Thai Navy warships. Still, heightened Cold War tension intruded when, just before midnight on 8 June, &quot;Aneroid&quot; – a Soviet intelligence gathering trawler – fired an illumination flare over Thai ship HTMS &quot;Khirirat&quot;.

Departing Thailand, on 19 June, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot;, guided-missile cruiser &quot;Sterett&quot; (CG-31), and two other destroyers passed into the South China Sea on their way to Subic Bay. The next evening, Soviet aircraft – presumably from bases in Vietnam – began shadowing the American warships. At around 22:00, a Soviet aircraft dropped 16 flares over &quot;Turner Joy&quot; (DD-951). A few minutes later, &quot;Lynde McCormick&quot; (DDG-8) received .30-caliber machinegun fire from an unidentified ship in the vicinity. The warship responded in kind, deliberately aiming high; and the foreign ship ceased fire. Although tension remained high the rest of the night, no other incidents occurred; and the warships arrived at Subic Bay on 23 June. After that, however, &quot;Stoddert&quot; passed her remaining five weeks in the western Pacific without incident; and, following two &quot;war-at-sea&quot; exercises in the waters off Japan, she steamed for home on 6 August.

Mooring at Pearl Harbor on 12 August, the warship spent the rest of the year doing maintenance work on her boilers and standing several regular safety and readiness inspections. During the first three weeks of 1983, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; prepared for a joint Navy-Air Force exercise in the Hawaiian Islands. This refresher training included helicopter operations, naval gunfire support, damage control drills, and antisubmarine systems&#x27; tests. The highlight of Exercise &quot;MidPacTraEx,&quot; held between 31 January and 3 February, was a defensive ASW operation with &quot;Harold E. Holt&quot; (FF-1074) and &quot;Willamette&quot; (AO-180). Later that month, she served as &quot;surface deep dive safety ship&quot; for &quot;Sargo&quot; (SSN-583).

In a scenery shift from her familiar operational zone, the guided-missile destroyer sailed from Pearl Harbor to the southern California operating area on 31 March. There, she conducted a &quot;war at sea&quot; exercise with DesRon 17 in early April. The warship then joined &quot;Ranger&quot; (CV-61) and operated with her battle group along the west coasts of California and Central America for the next four weeks. These evolutions were intended, in part, to demonstrate American resolve in checking the spread of communism in Central America.

Returning to Pearl Harbor on 25 May, the guided-missile destroyer remained in port for the next eight weeks. Between 21 and 24 July, the warship took part in a joint ASW exercise with &quot;Sample&quot; (FF-1048), &quot;Cochrane&quot; (DDG-21), &quot;Harold E. Holt&quot;, and three Japanese warships before getting ready to deploy overseas once more. On 26 August, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; put to sea with &quot;Ranger&quot;″s battle group and steered for the Philippines, arriving in Subic Bay on 14 September. Earlier in the year, and partly in response to the outbreak of the Iran–Iraq War in 1980, the United States had established Central Command (CentCom) in the western reaches of the Indian Ocean to protect American security interests in the Middle East; and &quot;Ranger&quot;&#x27;s group received orders to patrol the northern portion of the Arabian Sea in support of CentCom&#x27;s mission.

Departing Subic Bay on 26 September, the battle group set course for the Strait of Malacca. The unit&#x27;s transit of the South China Sea was interrupted on the 30th, however, when &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; rescued 39 Vietnamese refugees from their sinking boat, an act that later brought her the Humanitarian Service Medal. Once the refugees had been passed along, the group continued on south and west, passing through the Strait of Malacca and entering the Indian Ocean on 4 October. Linking up with a British force built around , the warships sailed northwest and arrived on station in the Arabian Sea on 12 October. &quot;Stoddert&quot; remained in the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf through the end of the year, helping to assure Western access to oil and countering the spread of Soviet influence in the region. During this period, she paid two visits to El Masirah, Oman, and called at Karachi, Pakistan.

On 15 January 1984, the American task group turned east for the long voyage back to Hawaii. After stops in Singapore and Subic Bay, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; moored in Pearl Harbor on 22 February. Six days later, she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a major equipment overhaul. During the ensuing 15-month shipyard period, the guided-missile destroyer received new radar and fire-control systems, the navy tactical data system (NTDS), the integrated automatic detection and tracking system (IADTS) and a modernized steam engineering plant. In addition to her combat systems&#x27; overhaul, she had her antiship capabilities enhanced by the installation of Harpoon missile launchers. Completing the overhaul on 9 July 1985, &quot;Stoddert&quot; occupied the rest of the year with a series of local operations and inspections. These ranged from a joint ASW exercise with Australian and New Zealand warships at sea to the more mundane propulsion plant and ordnance safety inspections while in port.

The warship&#x27;s first exercise in the new year took place between 23 and 28 January 1986. &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; operated as part of an &quot;enemy&quot; surface and submarine force that &quot;attacked&quot; the Enterprise battle group. Two more individual ship exercises followed in February. Then, after a command inspection in late March and a nuclear weapons certification inspection in early April, &quot;Stoddert&quot; got underway for &quot;RimPac 86&quot;, an international naval exercise held in Hawaiian waters between 21 May and 12 June. As a unit of the &quot;Blue Force,&quot; she served as communications link ship with the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force warships involved in the maneuvers. The guided-missile destroyer also covered a SEAL team insertion and extraction mission during the exercise. During rimpac86 the Stoddert had port calls in San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle and Vancouver BC, where crew members were able to attend the Vancouver Worlds Fair, before returning home.

After five more months of local training operations and other preparatory tasks, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; finally got underway for another Middle East deployment on 28 November. Steaming in company with &quot;Hepburn&quot; (FF-1055) and &quot;Mahlon S. Tisdale&quot; (FFG-27), she first sailed to the Philippines. After a week of upkeep at Subic Bay, &quot;Stoddert&quot; set out south on 21 December, stopping at Singapore on the 25th before passing the Strait of Malacca on the 26th and ending the year with a fuel stop at Colombo, Sri Lanka. The guided-missile destroyer continued on to the Middle East in the new year and relieved &quot;Goldsborough&quot; on station in the Persian Gulf on 6 January. Although Iranian and Iraqi attacks on neutral tankers had begun to increase in early 1987, no firm American policy regarding this &quot;tanker war&quot; had yet been established. This limited &quot;Stoddert&quot;&#x27;s mission, therefore, to surveillance operations against Iranian forces, especially &quot;Silkworm&quot; missile sites in the Strait of Hormuz, and to the provision of communications and other data links to friendly aircraft in the region.

Relieved by &quot;Waddell&quot; (DDG-24) on 4 April after three months on station, the warship steamed toward home, passing into the Indian Ocean and stopping at Colombo on the 9th to refuel. Following port visits to Phuket, Thailand, between 13 and 16 April and at Hong Kong between 23 and 27 April, the guided-missile destroyer moored at Pearl Harbor on 9 May. After a four-week leave and upkeep standdown, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; resumed the familiar routine. This included various weapons and supply inspections, equipment alterations in the shipyard, and training ashore for crew members. In addition, the warship participated in a joint Navy-Coast Guard exercise in late June, took part in ASW drills in mid-August, and served as ready duty destroyer during the month of September. She then began a phased maintenance availability at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on 26 October.

With the repairs and upgrades to her engineering plant finished on 9 February 1988, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; began preparing for an upcoming fleet exercise. The warship set out for San Diego on 15 March, completing a transit exercise – including service as the target for simulated attacks by two attack submarines – before mooring in San Diego harbor on the 31st. On 8 April, she put to sea for &quot;FleetEx 88-2&quot;, a carrier battle group exercise held off southern California, in which &quot;Stoddert&quot;&#x27;s crew took &quot;revenge&quot; for the transit exercise by successfully engaging a target submarine with an exercise torpedo. Later, she joined the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; (CVN-70) battle group and, in simulated air attacks, shot down three target drones with as many Standard SM-1 missiles. After more than two weeks of intensive training, the warship sailed for home, arriving in Pearl Harbor on 30 April.

Although originally scheduled for an overseas deployment in June, the warship delayed her departure until September so she could join the &quot;Nimitz&quot; (CVN-68) battle group. Her crew spent the summer testing new maintenance procedures, passing safety inspections, and taking the warship to sea for exercises such as the combined American, Australian, Canadian, and Japanese &quot;RimPac 88&quot; battle problems held between 7 and 17 July. Finally embarking on her deployment on 20 September, the warship joined &quot;Waddell&quot;, &quot;Hepburn&quot;, &quot;Barbey&quot; (FF-1088), &quot;Kiska&quot; (AE-35), and &quot;Willamette&quot; (AO-180) in Battle Group &quot;Bravo&quot; for the voyage west to the Persian Gulf. After a stop at Subic Bay between 7 and 11 October, the group conducted a few days of gunnery practice at the Tabones range in the Philippines before sailing to Hong Kong for liberty. Departing the British Crown Colony on the 20th, the battle group headed south, navigated the Malacca Strait, and passed into the Indian Ocean. From there, the warships took up station in the northern part of the Arabian Sea on 30 October.

Although the &quot;tanker war&quot; in the Persian Gulf had ended on 20 August with the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq, American warships still patrolled the region, replacing tanker-escort duty with general &quot;zone defense.&quot; &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; remained in the Arabian Sea for the first 10 days of this mission before receiving a brief availability alongside Prairie at the Masirah anchorage between 10 and 16 November. From there, she moved to the Strait of Hormuz and relieved &quot;Antietam&quot; (CG-54) as patrol ship there. Turning over that patrol station to &quot;California&quot; (CGN-36) on 2 December, the warship returned to the Arabian Sea for another 10 days with Battle Group &quot;Bravo&quot;. After 56 days at sea, the crew displayed palpable relief when the guided-missile destroyer put into Abu Dhabi for a three-day port visit on 14 December. While returning to her unit on the 18th, &quot;Stoddert&quot; provided medical assistance to three injured crew members of the British merchant vessel &quot;British Trident&quot;. Shortly thereafter, the group sailed east, passing through the Malacca Strait and anchoring at Singapore on 31 December.

Following a six-day port visit, the group steamed back into the Indian Ocean for a quick drop south of the equator on 9 January 1989 before returning through the Strait of Malacca on the 19th. The warships then steamed north into the South China Sea for four days of ASW exercises with units of the Royal Thai Navy, followed by a three-day visit to Pattaya Beach, Thailand. &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; then sailed independently for Subic Bay, arriving there on 1 February to begin a week-long upkeep and maintenance availability dedicated to main propulsion plant repairs. Departing the Philippines on 8 February, &quot;Stoddert&quot; steamed across the Pacific and moored in Pearl Harbor on 21 February.

At the end of a four-week post-deployment standdown, the guided-missile destroyer began preparations for a series of engineering and general survey inspections set for late spring. Those inspections ended late in June, and July passed relatively slowly, marked by an overnight &quot;tiger cruise&quot; for crew dependents on the 18th, and a port visit to Hilo, Hawaii, between 19 and 25 July. A week after that, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for two weeks of law enforcement operations with the United States Coast Guard. The warship used her surface search radars and other equipment to spot small craft, which were then boarded by Coast Guard detachments in search of drug smugglers. Back in port on 11 August, &quot;Stoddert&quot; spent the next week training submarine prospective commanding officers.

==1990s==
Toward the end of August, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; started preparing for a phased maintenance availability, which she began on 12 September in the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. During the ensuing five months, the warship received extensive equipment upgrades and regularly scheduled maintenance work on her propulsion plant. Pronounced ready for duty on 1 March, the warship conducted another Coast Guard law enforcement operation in Hawaiian waters. Then, on 16 April, she joined the familiar multinational exercise &quot;RIMPAC 90&quot;. She conducted ASW and anti-surface ship exercises during this period, highlighted by a successful Standard missile shot in early May.

Back in Pearl Harbor on 12 May, &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; did not leave Hawaii until 18 June when she set out for Central America and another Coast Guard law enforcement deployment. The warship began patrol operations off Baja California on the 27th and remained there – save for a single port visit to San Diego – through 11 August. After rendezvousing with &quot;Badger&quot; (FF-1071) and &quot;Kawishiwi&quot; (AO-146), the guided-missile destroyer sailed south for a drug interdiction patrol off Panama. These operations continued until 11 September, when the warship put into Rodman, Panama – the first landfall for the crew after 47 days at sea. Departing Panama on the 14th, the guided-missile destroyer returned to her patrol station, remaining there until 29 September when she was relieved by &quot;Waddell&quot;. Instead of sailing northwest for home, however, &quot;Stoddert&quot; passed through the Panama Canal on 3 October, entered the Caribbean Sea – the first and only arm of the Atlantic Ocean to wash her hull – and pulled into Willemstad, Curaçao, on the 6th. After a five-day port visit, she turned west for her transit home, arriving in Pearl Harbor on 29 October. The guided-missile destroyer spent the rest of the year in port undergoing routine inspections and maintenance.

&quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; began her last year in service with a surface warfare exercise in late January 1991, and her crew remained busy with training through the end of March. Departing Hawaii on 3 April, the warship cruised in southern California waters for the next five weeks, conducting antisubmarine warfare (ASW) drills and naval gunfire practice off San Clemente in addition to readiness training with the &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; (CVN-72) battle group. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 15 May.

Following a series of inspections in June, the warship remained in port – save for a few days of local operations – as the crew prepared her for inactivation. On 3 September, the guided-missile destroyer began pre-inactivation procedures and unloaded all her fuel and ammunition. &quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; was decommissioned at Pearl Harbor on 20 December 1991, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 20 November 1992. On 7 September 1995, she was transferred to the Maritime Administration and was berthed with its National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, Calif., to await disposal. On 3 February 2001, while under tow to Brownsville, Texas, for scrapping, the old guided missile destroyer took on water and sank in the Pacific.

==Honors==
&quot;Benjamin Stoddert&quot; received nine battle stars for Vietnam service.
Combat Action Ribbon &amp; Meritorious Unit Citation – 1972 WestPac

<text>Tus () was an ancient city in Khorasan near the modern city of Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan province, Iran. To the ancient Greeks, it was known as Susia (). It was also known as Tusa. The area now known as Tus was divided into four cities, Tabran, Radakan, Noan and Teroid, which in combination formed largest city in the region in the fifth century.

==History==
According to legend Tous son of Nowzar founded the city of Tous in the province of Khorassan next to today&#x27;s city of Mashhad. It is said that the city of Tous was the capital of Parthia and the residence of King Vishtaspa, who was the first convert to Zoroastianism. It was captured by Alexander the Great in 330 BCE, and became a key waypoint on the Silk Road.

Tus was taken by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik and remained under Umayyad control until 747, when a subordinate of Abu Muslim Khorasani defeated the Umayyad governor during the Abbasid Revolution. In 809, the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid fell ill and died in Tus, on his way to solve the unrest in Khorasan. His grave is located in the region.

In the 9th and 10th century, the Persian literature flourished in Khorasan and Transoxiana under Samanid Empire and other Iranian dynasties. The most famous person who has emerged from that area is the poet Ferdowsi, author of the Persian epic Shahnameh, whose mausoleum, built in 1934 in time for the millennium of his birth, dominates the town. Other notable residents of Tus include the theologian, jurist, philosopher and mystic al-Ghazali; early polymath Jābir ibn Hayyān; the poet Asadi Tusi; the powerful Seljuk vizier Nizam al-Mulk; the medieval polymath Nasir al-Din al-Tusi; the prominent Usooli &quot;mujtahid&quot; (Twelver-Shi&#x27;a law interpreter) Shaykh Tusi; and the noted Sufi mystic and historian Abu Nasr as-Sarraj. The Samanid poet Daqiqi was also a native of Tus.

In 1220, Tus was sacked by the Mongol general, Subutai, and a year later Tolui would kill most of its populace, and destroying the tomb of Caliph Harun al-Rashid in the process. Tus was rebuilt in 1239 under the governorship of Kuerguez. The city was attacked again in 1256 by the Mongols during Hulegu&#x27;s campaign against the Nizari Ismailis.

== Registration of Ferdowsi&#x27;s Tomb in UNESCO ==
Ferdowsi Tomb has been nationally registered in the Iranian Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization and at the suggestion of the Cultural Heritage Organization and Ferdowsi Foundation, efforts have been made to pursue the registration of Ferdowsi Tomb in the UNESCO World Heritage List.

<doc id="518893" wikidata="Q681698" url="?curid=518893" title="Appendicular skeleton">
<text>The appendicular skeleton is the portion of the vertebrate endoskeleton consisting of the bones, cartilages and ligaments that support the paired appendages (fins, flippers or limbs). In most terrestrial vertebrates (except snakes, legless lizards and caecillians), the appendicular skeleton and the associated skeletal muscles are the predominant locomotive structures.

There are 126 bones in the human appendicular skeleton, includes the skeletal elements within the shoulder and pelvic girdles, upper and lower limbs, and hands and feet. These bones have shared ancestry (are homologous) to those in the forelimbs and hindlimbs of all other tetrapods, which are in turn homologous to the pectoral and pelvic fins in fish.

== Etymology ==
The adjective &quot;appendicular&quot; comes from Latin &quot;appendicula&quot;, meaning &quot;small addition&quot;. It is the diminutive of &quot;appendix&quot;, which comes from the prefix &quot;ad-&quot; (meaning &quot;to&quot;) + and the word root &quot;pendere&quot; (meaning&quot;to hang&quot;, from PIE root &quot;*(s)pen-&quot; meaning &quot;to draw, stretch, spin&quot;).

==The organization of the appendicular system==
Of the 206 bones in the human skeleton, the appendicular skeleton comprises 126. Functionally, it is involved in terrestrial locomotion and weight-bearing (lower limbs), and grasping and object manipulation (upper limbs).

The appendicular skeleton forms during development from cartilage, by the process of endochondral ossification.

The appendicular skeleton is divided into six major regions:

* Shoulder girdle (4 bones) - Left and right clavicle (2) and scapula (2).
* Arms and forearms (6 bones) - Left and right humerus (2) (arm), ulna (2) and radius (2) (forearm).
* Hands and wrists (54 bones) - Left and right carpals (16) (wrist), metacarpals (10) (palm), proximal phalanges (10), intermediate phalanges (8) and distal phalanges (10) (finger).
* Pelvis (2 bones) - left and right hip bones (2), each of which is actually a fusion of three bones (ilium, ischium and pubis).
* Thighs and legs (8 bones) - Left and right femur (2) (thigh), patella (2) (knee), tibia (2) and fibula (2) (leg).
* Feet and ankles (52 bones) - Left and right tarsals (14) (ankle), metatarsals (10) (foot), proximal phalanges(10), intermediate phalanges (8) and distal phalanges (10) (toe).

Through anatomical variation, the appendicular skeleton may have an accessory bone. Examples include sesamoids in the hands and feet. Some occurrences are rarer than others.

The 126 bones of the appendicular skeleton and the 80 bones of the axial skeleton together form the complete skeleton of 206 bones in the human body. Unlike the axial skeleton, the appendicular skeleton is made up of significantly more long bones and predominantly articulated via synovial joints, which allow for a much greater range of motion.

<text>USS &quot;Cochrane&quot; (DDG-21) was a guided missile destroyer built for the United States Navy in the 1960s.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; class was based on a stretched hull modified to accommodate smaller RIM-24 Tartar surface-to-air missiles and all their associated equipment. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draft of . They displaced at full load. Their crew consisted of 18 officers and 320 enlisted men.

The ships were equipped with two geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were intended to produce to reach the designed speed of . The &quot;Adams&quot; class had a range of at a speed of .

The &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class ships were armed with two 5&quot;/54 caliber Mark 42 gun forward, one each forward and aft of the superstructure. They were fitted with an eight-round ASROC launcher between the funnels. Close-range anti-submarine defense was provided by two triple sets of Mk 32 torpedo tubes. The primary armament of the ships was the Tartar surface-to-air missile designed to defend the carrier battle group. They were fired via the Mk 13 missile launcher and the ships stowed a total of 40 missiles for the launcher.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Cochrane&quot;, named for Vice Admiral Edward L. Cochrane, USN, was laid down by the Puget Sound Bridge and Dredging Company at Seattle, Washington on 31 July 1961, launched on 18 July 1962 and commissioned on 21 March 1964. In April 1975 &quot;Cochrane&quot; participated in Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon, Vietnam.

On 1 October 1980 &quot;Cochrane&quot; rescued 104 Vietnamese refugees east of Saigon. &quot;Cochrane&quot; was decommissioned on 1 October 1990, struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 November 1992 and sold as scrap to International Shipbreaking, Incorporated, of Brownsville in Texas on 14 November 2000.

==In Popular Culture==

&quot;Cochrane&quot; appears in the original Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series) season 8 episode Murder: Eyes Only.

&quot;Cochrane&quot; also appears in the 1987 Kevin Costner film &quot;No Way Out.&quot;

<text>The Grumman F4F Wildcat is an American carrier-based fighter aircraft that entered service in 1940 with the United States Navy, and the British Royal Navy where it was initially known as the Martlet. First used by the British in the North Atlantic, the Wildcat was the only effective fighter available to the United States Navy and Marine Corps in the Pacific Theater during the early part of the Second World War. The disappointing Brewster Buffalo was withdrawn in favor of the Wildcat and replaced as aircraft became available.

With a top speed of , the Wildcat was outperformed by the faster [], more maneuverable, and longer-ranged Mitsubishi A6M Zero. US Navy pilots, including John &quot;Jimmy&quot; Thach, a pioneer of fighter tactics to deal with the A6M Zero, were greatly dissatisfied with the Wildcat&#x27;s inferior performance against the Zero in the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway. The Wildcat has a claimed air combat kill-to-loss ratio of 5.9:1 in 1942 and 6.9:1 for the war.

Lessons learned from the Wildcat were later applied to the faster F6F Hellcat. While the Wildcat had better range and maneuverability at low speed, the Hellcat could rely on superior power and high speed performance to outperform the Zero. Wildcat production continued throughout the remainder of the war, with Wildcats serving on escort carriers, where the larger and much heavier Hellcat could not be used. 

From 1942-on, production of the Wildcat (in fact nearly three quarters of its the total production) was subcontracted to a purposely established division of General Motors: the Eastern Aircraft Division.

==Design and development==
Grumman fighter development began with the two-seat Grumman FF biplane. The FF was the first U.S. naval fighter with a retractable landing gear. The wheels retracted into the fuselage, leaving the tires visibly exposed, flush with the sides of the fuselage. Two single-seat biplane designs followed, the F2F and F3F, which established the general fuselage outlines of what would become the F4F Wildcat. In 1935, while the F3F was still undergoing flight testing, Grumman started work on its next biplane fighter, the G-16. At the time, the U.S. Navy favored a monoplane design, the Brewster F2A-1, ordering production early in 1936. However, an order was also placed for Grumman&#x27;s G-16 (given the navy designation XF4F-1) as a backup in case the Brewster monoplane proved to be unsatisfactory.

It was clear to Grumman that the XF4F-1 would be inferior to the Brewster monoplane, so Grumman abandoned the XF4F-1, designing instead a new monoplane fighter, the XF4F-2. The XF4F-2 would retain the same, fuselage-mounted, hand-cranked main landing gear as the F3F, with its relatively narrow track. The unusual manually-retractable main landing gear design for all of Grumman&#x27;s U.S. Navy fighters up to and through the F4F, as well as for the amphibious Grumman J2F utility biplane, was originally created in the 1920s by Leroy Grumman for Grover Loening. Landing accidents caused by failure of the main gear to fully lock into place were distressingly common.

The overall performance of Grumman&#x27;s new monoplane was felt to be inferior to that of the Brewster Buffalo. The XF4F-2 was marginally faster, but the Buffalo was more maneuverable. The Buffalo was judged superior and was chosen for production. After losing out to Brewster, Grumman completely rebuilt the prototype as the XF4F-3 with new wings and tail and a supercharged version of the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 &quot;Twin Wasp&quot; radial engine. Testing of the new XF4F-3 led to an order for F4F-3 production models, the first of which was completed in February 1940. France also ordered the type, powered by a Wright R-1820 &quot;Cyclone 9&quot; radial engine, but France fell to the Axis powers before they could be delivered and the aircraft went instead to the British Royal Navy, who christened the new fighter the Martlet. The U.S. Navy officially adopted the aircraft type on 1 October 1941 as the Wildcat. The Royal Navy&#x27;s and U.S. Navy&#x27;s F4F-3s, armed with four .50 in (12.7 mm) Browning machine guns, joined active units in 1940.

On 16 December 1940, the XF4F-3 prototype, BuNo &quot;0383&quot;, c/n 356, modified from XF4F-2, was lost under circumstances that suggested that the pilot may have been confused by the poor layout of fuel valves and flap controls and inadvertently turned the fuel valve to &quot;off&quot; immediately after takeoff rather than selecting flaps &quot;up&quot;. This was the first fatality in the type.

==Operational history==
Even before the Wildcat had been purchased by the U.S. Navy, the French Navy and the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm (FAA) had ordered the Wildcat, with their own configurations, via the Anglo-French Purchasing Board.

===Royal Navy===

The F4F, initially known in British service as the Martlet, was taken on by the FAA as an interim replacement for the Fairey Fulmar. The Fulmar was a two-seat fighter with good range but operated at a performance disadvantage against single-seater fighters. Navalised Supermarine Spitfires were not available because of the greater need of the Royal Air Force. In the European theater, its first combat victory was on Christmas Day 1940, when a land-based Martlet destroyed a Junkers Ju 88 bomber over the Scapa Flow naval base. This was the first combat victory by a US-built fighter in British service in World War II.

The type also pioneered combat operations from the smaller escort carriers. Six Martlets went to sea aboard the converted former German merchant vessel in September 1941 and shot down several Luftwaffe Fw 200 Condor bombers during highly effective convoy escort operations. These were the first of many Wildcats to engage in aerial combat at sea, including Convoy HG 76 to Gibraltar, in December 1941.

The British received 300 Eastern Aircraft FM-1s giving them the designation Martlet V in 1942–43 and 340 FM-2s, (having changed to using the same name as the US) as the Wildcat VI. Nearly 1,200 Wildcats were flown by the FAA and by January 1944, the Martlet name was dropped and the type was identified as the Wildcat. In March 1945, Wildcats shot down four Messerschmitt Bf 109s over Norway, the FAA&#x27;s last Wildcat victories. 

The last air raid of the war in Europe was carried out by Fleet Air Arm aircraft in Operation Judgement on 5 May 1945. Twenty eight Wildcat VI aircraft from 846, 853 and 882 Naval Air Squadron, flying from escort carriers, took part in an attack on a U-boat depot near Harstad, Norway. Two ships and a U-boat were sunk with the loss of one Wildcat and one Grumman Avenger torpedo-bomber.

===US Navy and Marine Corps===
====Pacific====
The Wildcat was generally outperformed by the Mitsubishi Zero, its major opponent in the early part of the Pacific Theater but held its own partly because, with relatively heavy armor and self-sealing fuel tanks, the Grumman airframe could survive far more damage than its lightweight, unarmored Japanese rival. Many U.S. Navy fighter pilots were saved by the Wildcat&#x27;s ZB homing device, which allowed them to find their carriers in poor visibility, provided they could get within the range of the homing beacon. (However, the Zed Baker was wildly inconsistent in practice, especially during the Battle of Midway, when an entire squadron of Wildcats crashed in the sea after failing to locate their carriers).

In the hands of an expert pilot with a tactical advantage, the Wildcat could prove a difficult opponent even against the formidable Zero. After analyzing Fleet Air Tactical Unit Intelligence Bureau reports describing the new carrier fighter, USN Commander &quot;Jimmy&quot; Thach devised a defensive tactic that allowed Wildcat formations to act in a coordinated maneuver to counter a diving attack, called the &quot;Thach Weave&quot;. The most widely employed tactic during the Guadalcanal Campaign was high-altitude ambush, where hit-and-run maneuvers were executed using altitude advantage. This was possible due to an early warning system composed of Coastwatchers and radar. On rare occasions, when Wildcats were unable to gain altitude in time, they would suffer many losses. On 2 October 1942, a Japanese air raid from Rabaul was not detected in time and the Cactus Air Force lost six Wildcats to only one Zero destroyed. On the very first day of the campaign, before the establishment of Henderson field, Wildcat fighters of TF16 (USS Enterprise) lost 10 fighters and an SBD performing CAP duty to Rabaul based Tainan Kōkūtai Zero fighters, in exchange for one Zero that was forced to crash-land later, these losses included US Fighter Ace James &#x27;Pug&#x27; Southerland who was shot down by IJNAS ace Saburō Sakai (but survived). During the most intense initial phase of the Guadalcanal Campaign, between 1 August and 15 November, combat records indicate that US lost 115 Wildcats and Japanese lost 106 Zeros to all causes; the Japanese lost many more pilots compared to the US.

Thach was greatly dissatisfied and a vocal critic of the Wildcat&#x27;s performance during the war (as were many US carrier pilots), stating in his Midway action report;

Four U.S. Marine Corps Wildcats played a prominent role in the defense of Wake Island in December 1941. USN and USMC aircraft formed the fleet&#x27;s primary air defense during the Battle of Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway and land-based Wildcats played a major role during the Guadalcanal Campaign of 1942–43. It was not until 1943 that more advanced naval fighters capable of taking on the Zero on more even terms, the Grumman F6F Hellcat and Vought F4U Corsair, reached the South Pacific theater.

The Japanese ace Saburō Sakai described the Wildcat&#x27;s capacity to absorb damage:

Grumman&#x27;s Wildcat production ceased in early 1943 to make way for the newer F6F Hellcat but General Motors continued producing Wildcats for U.S. Navy and Fleet Air Arm use. At first, GM produced the FM-1 (identical to the F4F-4 but with four guns). Production later switched to the improved FM-2 (based on Grumman&#x27;s XF4F-8 prototype, informally known as the &quot;Wilder Wildcat&quot;) optimized for small-carrier operations, with a more powerful engine and a taller tail to cope with the increased torque.

From 1943, Wildcats equipped with bomb racks were primarily assigned to escort carriers for use against submarines and attacking ground targets, though they would also continue to score kills against Japanese fighters, bombers and kamikaze aircraft. Larger fighters such as the Hellcat and the Corsair and dive bombers were needed aboard fleet carriers and the Wildcat&#x27;s slower landing speed made it more suitable for shorter flight decks.

In the Battle off Samar on 25 October 1944, escort carriers of Task Unit 77.4.3 (&quot;Taffy 3&quot;) and their escort of destroyers and destroyer escorts found themselves as the sole force standing between vulnerable troop transport and supply ships engaged in landings on the Philippine island of Leyte and a powerful Japanese surface fleet of battleships and cruisers. In desperation, lightly armed Avengers and FM-2 Wildcats from Taffys 1, 2 and 3 resorted to tactics such as strafing ships, including the bridge of the Japanese battleship , while the destroyers and destroyer escorts attacked the Japanese surface force. This action contributed to buying enough time for Taffy 3&#x27;s escort carriers to escape into a rain squall.

====Atlantic====
U.S. Navy Wildcats participated in Operation Torch. USN escort carriers in the Atlantic used Wildcats until the end of the war. In October 1943 F4Fs participated in Operation Leader, an anti-shipping strike on Norway.

===Totals===
In all, 7,860 Wildcats were built.. Nearly three quarters of this total were build by General Motors&#x27;Eastern Aircraft Division which took over production in 1942. During the course of the war, Navy and Marine F4Fs and FMs flew 15,553 combat sorties (14,027 of these from aircraft carriers), destroying a claimed figure of 1,327 enemy aircraft at a cost of 178 aerial losses, 24 to ground/shipboard fire, and 49 to operational causes (an overall claimed kill-to-loss ratio of 6.9:1). True to their escort fighter role, Wildcats dropped only 154 tons of bombs during the war.

==Variants==
===U.S. Navy Wildcats===
====F4F-1/-2====
The original Grumman F4F-1 design was a biplane, which proved inferior to rival designs, necessitating a complete redesign as a monoplane named the F4F-2. This design was still not competitive with the Brewster F2A Buffalo which won initial U.S. Navy orders, but when the F4F-3 development was fitted with a more powerful version of the engine, a Pratt &amp; Whitney Twin Wasp R-1830-76, featuring a two-stage supercharger, it showed its true potential.

====F4F-3====
U.S. Navy orders followed as did some (with Wright Cyclone engines) from France; these ended up with the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm after the fall of France and entered service on 8 September 1940. These aircraft, designated by Grumman as G-36A, had a different cowling from other earlier F4Fs and fixed wings, and were intended to be fitted with French armament and instruments following delivery. In British service initially, the aircraft were known as the Martlet I, but not all Martlets would be to exactly the same specifications as U.S. Navy aircraft. All Martlet Is featured the four .50 in (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns of the F4F-3 with 450 rpg. The British directly ordered and received a version with the original Twin Wasp, but again with a modified cowling, under the manufacturer designation G-36B. These aircraft were given the designation Martlet II by the British. The first 10 G-36Bs were fitted with non-folding wings and were given the designation Martlet III. These were followed by 30 folding wing aircraft (F4F-3As) which were originally destined for the Hellenic Air Force, which were also designated Martlet IIIs. On paper, the designation changed to Martlet III(A) when the second series of Martlet III was introduced.

Poor design of the armament installation on early F4Fs caused these otherwise reliable machine guns to frequently jam, a problem common to wing-mounted weapons of many U.S. fighters early in the war. An F4F-3 flown by Lieutenant Edward O&#x27;Hare shot down, within a few minutes, five Mitsubishi twin-engine bombers attacking off Bougainville on 20 February 1942. But contrasting with O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s performance, his wingman was unable to participate because his guns would not function.

A shortage of two-stage superchargers led to the development of the F4F-3A, which was basically the F4F-3 but with a Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830-90 radial engine with a more primitive single-stage two-speed supercharger. The F4F-3A, which was capable of at , was used side by side with the F4F-3, but its poorer performance made it unpopular with U.S. Navy fighter pilots. The F4F-3A would enter service as the Martlet III(B).

At the time of Pearl Harbor, only had a fully equipped Wildcat squadron, VF-6 with F4F-3As. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was then transferring a detachment of VMF-211, also equipped with F4F-3s, to Wake. was in San Diego, working up for operations of the F4F-3s of VF-3. 11 F4F-3s of VMF-211 were at the Ewa Marine Air Corps Station on Oahu; nine of these were damaged or destroyed during the Japanese attack. The detachment of VMF-211 on Wake lost seven Wildcats to Japanese attacks on 8 December, but the remaining five put up a fierce defense, making the first bomber kill on 9 December. The destroyer was sunk by the Wildcats, and the Japanese invasion force retreated.

In May 1942, the F4F-3s of VF-2 and VF-42, aboard and &quot;Lexington&quot;, participated in the Battle of the Coral Sea. &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; fought against the fleet carriers and and the light carrier in this battle, in an attempt to halt a Japanese invasion of Port Moresby on Papua. During these battles, it became clear that attacks without fighter escort amounted to suicide, but that the fighter component on the carriers was completely insufficient to provide both fighter cover for the carrier and an escort for an attack force. Most U.S. carriers carried fewer than 20 fighters.

====F4F-3P====
In June 1942, 17 F4F-3s and one F4F-3A (18 total) were converted into F4F-3P photoreconnaissance planes. The F4F-3Ps were for short-range tactical reconnaissance, as their reserve fuel tanks were removed and replaced with Fairchild F-56 cameras. The F4F-3Ps retained their machine guns and were mainly flown by VMO-251 on air defense missions from Espiritu Santo in the South Pacific, arriving in July 1942. In October 1942, long-ranged and unarmed F4F-7s began replacing the F4F-3Ps, but a detachment of three F4F-3P from VMO-155 operated from the &quot;Bogue&quot;-class escort carrier USS &quot;Nassau&quot; (CVE-16) during the amphibious invasion of Attu Island in May 1943.

====F4F-3S &quot;Wildcatfish&quot;====
This floatplane version of the F4F-3 was developed for use at forward island bases in the Pacific, before the construction of airfields. It was inspired by appearance of the A6M2-N &quot;Rufe&quot;, a modification of the Mitsubishi A6M2 &quot;Zeke&quot;. BuNo 4038 was modified to become the F4F-3S &quot;Wildcatfish&quot;. Twin floats, manufactured by Edo Aircraft Corporation, were fitted. To restore the stability, small auxiliary fins were added to the tailplane. Because this was still insufficient, a ventral fin was added later.

The F4F-3S was first flown 28 February 1943. The weight and drag of the floats reduced the maximum speed to . As the performance of the basic F4F-3 was already below that of the Zero, the F4F-3S was clearly of limited usefulness. In any case, the construction of the airfields at forward bases by the &quot;Seabees&quot; was surprisingly quick. Only one was converted.

====F4F-4====
A new version, the F4F-4, entered service in 1941 with six machine guns and the Grumman-patented Sto-Wing folding wing system, which allowed more aircraft to be stored on an aircraft carrier, increasing the number of fighters that could be parked on a surface by more than a factor of 2. The F4F-4 was the definitive version that saw the most combat service in the early war years, including the Battle of Midway. Navy F4F-3s were replaced by F4F-4s in June 1942. During the Battle of Midway, only VMF-221 still used F4F-3s. VF-42 of the &quot;Yorktown&quot; was the last carrier group converted to the F4F-4, and that was done as it left Pearl Harbor on the way to the Battle of Midway as VF-3 flew in new F4F-4s with Commander Thach.

The F4F-4 version was less popular with American pilots because the amount of ammunition was spread over two additional guns, decreasing firing time. With the F4F-3&#x27;s four .50 in (12.7 mm) guns and 450 rpg, pilots had 34 seconds of firing time; six guns decreased ammunition to 240 rpg, which could be expended in less than 20 seconds. The increase to six guns was attributed to the Royal Navy, who wanted greater firepower to deal with German and Italian foes. Jimmy Thach is quoted as saying, &quot;A pilot who cannot hit with four guns will miss with eight.&quot; Extra guns and folding wings meant extra weight and reduced performance: the F4F-4 was capable of only about at . Rate of climb was noticeably worse in the F4F-4; while Grumman optimistically claimed the F4F-4 could climb at a modest per minute, in combat conditions, pilots found their F4F-4s capable of ascending at only per minute. Moreover, the F4F-4&#x27;s folding wing was intended to allow five F4F-4s to be stowed in the space required by two F4F-3s. In practice, the folding wings allowed an increase of about 50% in the number of Wildcats carried aboard U.S. fleet aircraft carriers. A variant of the F4F-4, designated F4F-4B for contractual purposes, was supplied to the British with a modified cowling and Wright Cyclone engine. These aircraft received the designation of Martlet IV.

====F4F-5 Wildcat====
Two F4F-3s (the 3rd and 4th production aircraft, BuNo 1846/1847) were fitted with a Wright R-1820-40 engine and designated XF4F-5.

====FM-1/-2 Wildcat====

General Motors&#x27;Eastern Aircraft Division produced 5,280 FM variants of the Wildcat. Grumman&#x27;s Wildcat production ceased in early 1943 to make way for the newer F6F Hellcat, but General Motors continued producing Wildcats for both U.S. Navy and Fleet Air Arm use. Late in the war, the Wildcat was obsolescent as a front line fighter compared to the faster (380 mph/610 km/h) F6F Hellcat or much faster (446 mph/718 km/h) F4U Corsair. However, they were adequate for small escort carriers against submarine and shore threats. These relatively modest ships only carried two types of aircraft, the Wildcats and GM-built TBM Avengers. The Wildcat&#x27;s lower landing speed and ability to take off without a catapult made it more suitable for shorter flight decks. At first, GM produced the FM-1, identical to the F4F-4, but reduced the number of guns to four, and added wing racks for two 250 lb (110 kg) bombs or six rockets. Production later switched to the improved FM-2 (based on Grumman&#x27;s XF4F-8 prototype) optimized for small-carrier operations, with a more powerful engine (the Wright R-1820-56), and a taller tail to cope with the torque.

====F4F-7====
The F4F-7 was a photoreconnaissance variant, with armor and armament removed. It had non-folding &quot;wet&quot; wings that carried an additional 555 gal (2,101 L) of fuel for a total of about 700 gal (2,650 L), increasing its range to 3,700 mi (5,955 km). A total of 21 were built.

====F2M Wildcat====
The F2M-1 was a planned development of the FM-1 by General Motors / Eastern Aircraft to be powered by the improved XR-1820-70 engine, but the project was canceled before any aircraft were built.

===Royal Navy Martlets===
====Martlet Mk I====
At the end of 1939, Grumman received a French order for 81 aircraft of model G-36A, to equip their new s: and . The main difference with the basic model G-36 was due to the unavailability for export of the two-stage supercharged engine of the F4F-3. The G-36A was powered by the nine-cylinder, single-row Wright R-1820-G205A radial engine, of and with a single-stage two-speed supercharger.

The G-36A also had French instruments (with metric calibration), radio and gunsight. The throttle was modified to conform to French pre-war practice: the throttle lever was moved towards the pilot (i.e. backward) to increase engine power. The armament which was to be fitted in France was six 7.5 mm (.296 in) Darne machine guns (two in the fuselage and four in the wings). The first G-36A was flown on 11 May 1940. After France&#x27;s defeat in the Battle of France, all contracts were taken over by Britain. The throttle was modified again, four 0.50 in (12.7 mm) guns were installed in the wings and most traces of the original ownership removed.

The Martlets were modified for British use by Blackburn, which continued to do this for all later marks. British gunsights, catapult spools and other items were installed. After attempts to fit British radio sets, it was decided to use the superior American equipment. The first Martlets entered British service in August 1940, with 804 Naval Air Squadron, stationed at Hatston in the Orkney Islands. The Martlet Mk I did not have a wing folding mechanism and was therefore used primarily from land bases, with the notable exception of six aircraft of 882 Sqn aboard &quot;Illustrious&quot; from March 1942. In April 1942 &quot;Illustrious&quot; transferred two Martlet I aircraft to HMS &quot;Archer&quot; while in port at Freetown. One of her four retained Martlet I aircraft were subsequently fitted with folding wings by ship&#x27;s staff during passage to Durban. In 1940, Belgium also placed an order for at least 10 G-36A&#x27;s. These were to be modified with the same changes to the French aircraft, plus the removal of the tailhook as they were to be landbased. Belgium surrendered before any aircraft were delivered and by 10 May 1940, the aircraft order was transferred to the Royal Navy.

====Martlet Mk II====
Before the Fleet Air Arm took on charge the Martlet Mk Is, it had already ordered 100 G-36B fighters. The British chose the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830-S3C4-G engine to power this aircraft; this too had a single-stage, two-speed supercharger. The FAA decided to accept a delay in delivery to get Martlets fitted out with the Grumman-designed and patented Sto-Wing folding wing system first fitted onto U.S. Navy F4F-4 Wildcats, which were vitally important if the Martlet was to be used from the first 3 Illustrious class carriers which had elevators that were too narrow to accommodate non-folding wing aircraft. Nevertheless, the first 10 received had fixed wings. The first Martlet with folding wings was not delivered until August 1941.

In contrast to the USN F4F-3, the British aircraft were fitted with armor and self-sealing fuel tanks. The Mk II also had a larger tailwheel. For carrier operations, the &quot;sting&quot; tail hook and attachment point for the American single-point catapult launch system were considered important advantages. Nevertheless, the Martlets were modified to have British-style catapult spools. Deliveries of the folding-wing G-36Bs began in August 1941, with 36 shipped to the UK and 54 shipped to the Far East; they were designated &quot;Martlet Mark II&quot;. Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE) testing of the Martlet II at a mean weight of approximately showed a maximum speed of at and , a maximum climb rate of at at weight, and a time to climb to of 12.5 minutes. The service ceiling at was .

The Martlet was the second single-seat, monoplane fighter to operate from Royal Navy aircraft carriers following the introduction of the Sea Hurricane IB on in July 1941.

The majority of the Martlet Mk IIs were sent to the Far East. The first shipboard operations of the type in British service were in September 1941, aboard , a very small escort carrier with a carrier deck of by , no elevators and no hangar deck. The six Wildcats were parked on the deck at all times. On its first voyage, it served as escort carrier for a convoy to Gibraltar. On 20 September, a German Fw 200 was shot down. On the next voyage, four Fw 200 &quot;Condors&quot; fell to the guns of the Martlets, and of the combined total, two of these five Condors were shot down by Eric &quot;Winkle&quot; Brown during his time aboard. Operations from &quot;Audacity&quot; also demonstrated that the fighter cover was useful against U-boats. &quot;Audacity&quot; was sunk by a U-boat on 21 December 1941, and of the pilots only Brown and one other survived, but it had already proved the usefulness of escort carriers.

In May 1942, 881 and 882 squadrons on participated in operations against Madagascar. In August 1942, 806 NAS on provided fighter cover for a convoy to Malta. Later in that year they participated in the landings in French North Africa.

====Martlet Mk III====
The first 30 F4F-3As were released for sale to Greece, after the Italian invasion in November 1940. However, at the defeat of Greece in April 1941 the aircraft had only reached Gibraltar. They were taken over by the FAA as Martlet Mk III(B). As these aircraft did not have folding wings, they were only used from land bases. They served in a shore-based role in the Western Desert.

Ten fixed-wing G-36Bs were used by the FAA as Martlet III(A).

====Martlet Mk IV====
The Royal Navy purchased 220 F4F-4s adapted to British requirements. The main difference was the use of a Wright R-1820-40B Cyclone in a distinctly more rounded and compact cowling, with a single double-wide flap on each side of the rear and no lip intake. These machines were named Martlet Mk IV. Boscombe Down testing of the Martlet IV at weight showed a maximum speed of at and at , a maximum climb rate of at at weight, and a time to climb to of 14.6 minutes. The service ceiling at was .

====Martlet Mk V====
The Fleet Air Arm purchased 312 FM-1s, originally with the designation of Martlet V. In January 1944, a decision was made to retain the American names for US-supplied aircraft, redesignating the batch as the Wildcat V.

====Wildcat Mk VI====
The Wildcat VI was the Air Ministry name for the FM-2 Wildcat in FAA service.

<doc id="518899" wikidata="Q1275893" url="?curid=518899" title="The Skyliners">
<text>The Skyliners are an American doo-wop group from Pittsburgh. The original lineup was: Jimmy Beaumont (lead), Janet Vogel Rapp (soprano), Wally Lester (tenor), Jackie Taylor (bass voice, guitarist), Joe Verscharen (baritone). The Skyliners were best known for their 1959 hit, &quot;Since I Don&#x27;t Have You&quot;.

==History==
The Skyliners also hit the top 40 with &quot;This I Swear&quot; and &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot;. Other classics include &quot;It Happened Today&quot; (1959), &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot; (1961), and &quot;Comes Love&quot; (1962). The original group dissolved in 1963, but re-united eleven years later (without Jackie Taylor), for what would become their last charted record, &quot;Where Have They Gone?&quot;

In 1965, Jimmy Beaumont recorded two notable singles for the Bang label: the first record, &quot;Tell Me&quot;/&quot;I Feel Like I&#x27;m Falling in Love&quot;, had medium-tempo soul-styled tracks.

For his second Bang 45, &quot;You Got Too Much Going for You&quot;/&quot;I Never Loved Her Anyway&quot;, Beaumont transformed into an impressive soul singer, sounding nothing like his previous, more pop-styled efforts. It led some to question in later years, if it actually was his singing. These two tracks are now considered Northern Soul collectibles. The single was also issued on UK London HLZ 10059 in 1966.

Jackie Taylor was drafted into the U.S. Army about 1965. In 1975 Wally Lester and Joe Versharen left the group; they were replaced by new members, Jimmie Ross and Bob Sholes.

In 1978, the Detroit-based record producer Don Davis — who produced Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr., Johnny Taylor, the Dramatics, and the Dells — picked up one of his favorite groups (the Skyliners) to record in his United Sound Studios. They recorded the group&#x27;s &quot;comeback&quot; album for the RCA subsidiary, Tortoise International Records. The songs &quot;Oh, How Happy&quot; and &quot;The Love Bug&quot; were included, as was a hefty re-make of Dan Schafer&#x27;s original RCA Victor single, &quot;A Day Without You, Dear&quot;.

Janet Vogel committed suicide in 1980; Cathy Cooper joined the group as a replacement. She and Ross left two years later to form a duo; they were replaced by Rick Morris and Donna Groom.

Morris retired in 1993. Beaumont invited David Proch to join the group and he accepted. Also performing with the group at this time was Tom Sholes, brother of Bob Sholes. The two were local to the group; they attended St George High School in the Allentown neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The group became Beaumont, Groom, Proch, and Nick Pociask.

David Proch (at age 44) the third person to sing tenor for the Skyliners, died on October 19, 1998, in a car accident. His car collided with a truck hauling asphalt on U.S. Route 30 near Ligonier, Pennsylvania. Proch&#x27;s place was taken by Dick Muse, a former member of the Laurels. Rick Morris replaced Muse in 2011. Frank Czuri replaced Morris in 2013. In January 2019 Jim Gregorakis replaced Nick Pociask. Eric Bruce replaced Frank Czuri in September 2019.

Their longtime manager and producer Joe Rock, who also co-wrote &quot;Since I Don&#x27;t Have You&quot;, died on April 4, 2000, at age 63, after complications from quadruple bypass heart surgery.

Four of the original members have died:
* Janet Vogel (born June 10, 1942, in Pittsburgh) died by suicide on February 21, 1980, aged 37
* Joe Verscharen (born August 30, 1940, in Pittsburgh) died of cancer on November 2, 2007, aged 67
* Wally Lester (born Walter Paul Lester Jr. on October 5, 1941, in Pittsburgh) died of pancreatic cancer in Southport, North Carolina on April 21, 2015, aged 73
* Jimmy Beaumont (born James Beaumont on October 21, 1940, in Pittsburgh) died in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, on October 7, 2017, aged 76.

Until his death, Jimmy Beaumont performed with the Skyliners in their line-up of Nick Pociask, Frank Czuri, and Donna Groom (whose husband, Mark Groom, has been the group&#x27;s drummer/conductor for more than 25 years).

<doc id="518902" wikidata="Q192639" url="?curid=518902" title="Glycoside">
<text>In chemistry, a glycoside is a molecule in which a sugar is bound to another functional group via a glycosidic bond. Glycosides play numerous important roles in living organisms. Many plants store chemicals in the form of inactive glycosides. These can be activated by enzyme hydrolysis, which causes the sugar part to be broken off, making the chemical available for use. Many such plant glycosides are used as medications. Several species of &quot;Heliconius&quot; butterfly are capable of incorporating these plant compounds as a form of chemical defense against predators. In animals and humans, poisons are often bound to sugar molecules as part of their elimination from the body.

In formal terms, a glycoside is any molecule in which a sugar group is bonded through its anomeric carbon to another group via a glycosidic bond. Glycosides can be linked by an O- (an &quot;O-glycoside&quot;), N- (a &quot;glycosylamine&quot;), S-(a &quot;thioglycoside&quot;), or C- (a &quot;C-glycoside&quot;) glycosidic bond. According to the IUPAC, the name &quot;&quot;C&quot;-glycoside&quot; is a misnomer; the preferred term is &quot;&quot;C&quot;-glycosyl compound&quot;. The given definition is the one used by IUPAC, which recommends the Haworth projection to correctly assign stereochemical configurations.

Many authors require in addition that the sugar be bonded to a &quot;non-sugar&quot; for the molecule to qualify as a glycoside, thus excluding polysaccharides. The sugar group is then known as the &quot;glycone&quot; and the non-sugar group as the &quot;aglycone&quot; or &quot;genin&quot; part of the glycoside. The glycone can consist of a single sugar group (monosaccharide), two sugar groups (disaccharide), or several sugar groups (oligosaccharide).

The first glycoside ever identified was amygdalin, by the French chemists Pierre Robiquet and Antoine Boutron-Charlard, in 1830.

==Related compounds==

Molecules containing an N-glycosidic bond are known as glycosylamines. Many authors in biochemistry call these compounds &quot;N-glycosides&quot; and group them with the glycosides; this is considered a misnomer and is discouraged by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. Glycosylamines and glycosides are grouped together as glycoconjugates; other glycoconjugates include glycoproteins, glycopeptides, peptidoglycans, glycolipids, and lipopolysaccharides.

==Chemistry==
Much of the chemistry of glycosides is explained in the article on glycosidic bonds. For example, the glycone and aglycone portions can be chemically separated by hydrolysis in the presence of acid and can be hydrolyzed by alkali. There are also numerous enzymes that can form and break glycosidic bonds. The most important cleavage enzymes are the glycoside hydrolases, and the most important synthetic enzymes in nature are glycosyltransferases. Genetically altered enzymes termed glycosynthases have been developed that can form glycosidic bonds in excellent yield.

There are many ways to chemically synthesize glycosidic bonds. Fischer glycosidation refers to the synthesis of glycosides by the reaction of unprotected monosaccharides with alcohols (usually as solvent) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst. The Koenigs-Knorr reaction is the condensation of glycosyl halides and alcohols in the presence of metal salts such as silver carbonate or mercuric oxide.

==Classification==

Glycosides can be classified by the glycone, by the type of glycosidic bond, and by the aglycone.

===By glycone/presence of sugar===

If the glycone group of a glycoside is glucose, then the molecule is a glucoside; if it is fructose, then the molecule is a fructoside; if it is glucuronic acid, then the molecule is a glucuronide; etc. In the body, toxic substances are often bonded to glucuronic acid to increase their water solubility; the resulting glucuronides are then excreted. Compounds can also be generally defined based on the class of glycone; for example, biosides are glycosides with a disaccharide (biose) glycone.

===By type of glycosidic bond===

Depending on whether the glycosidic bond lies &quot;below&quot; or &quot;above&quot; the plane of the cyclic sugar molecule, glycosides are classified as α-glycosides or β-glycosides. Some enzymes such as α-amylase can only hydrolyze α-linkages; others, such as emulsin, can only affect β-linkages.

There are four type of linkages present between glycone and aglycone:
* C-linkage/glycosidic bond, &quot;nonhydrolysable by acids or enzymes&quot;
* O-linkage/glycosidic bond
* N-linkage/glycosidic bond
* S-linkage/glycosidic bond

=== By aglycone ===

Glycosides are also classified according to the chemical nature of the aglycone. For purposes of biochemistry and pharmacology, this is the most useful classification.

==== Alcoholic glycosides ====
An example of an alcoholic glycoside is salicin, which is found in the genus &quot;Salix&quot;. Salicin is converted in the body into salicylic acid, which is closely related to aspirin and has analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects.

==== Anthraquinone glycosides ====
These glycosides contain an aglycone group that is a derivative of anthraquinone. They have a laxative effect. They are mainly found in dicot plants except the family Liliaceae which are monocots. They are present in senna, rhubarb and &quot;Aloe&quot; species. Anthron and anthranol are reduced forms of anthraquinone.

==== Coumarin glycosides ====
Here, the aglycone is coumarin or a derivative. An example is apterin which is reported to dilate the coronary arteries as well as block calcium channels. Other coumarin glycosides are obtained from dried leaves of &quot;Psoralea corylifolia&quot;.

==== Chromone glycosides ====
In this case, the aglycone is called benzo-gamma-pyrone.

==== Cyanogenic glycosides ====

In this case, the aglycone contains a cyanohydrin group. Plants that make cyanogenic glycosides store them in the vacuole, but, if the plant is attacked, they are released and become activated by enzymes in the cytoplasm. These remove the sugar part of the molecule, allowing the cyanohydrin structure to collapse and release toxic hydrogen cyanide. Storing them in inactive forms in the vacuole prevents them from damaging the plant under normal conditions.

Along with playing a role in deterring herbivores, in some plants they control germination, bud formation, carbon and nitrogen transport, and possibly act as antioxidants. The production of cyanogenic glycosides is an evolutionarily conserved function, appearing in species as old as ferns and as recent as angiosperms. These compounds are made by around 3,000 species. In screens they are found in about 11% of cultivated plants but only 5% of plants overall; humans seem to have selected for them.

Examples include amygdalin and prunasin which are made by the bitter almond tree; other species that produce cyanogenic glycosides are sorghum (from which dhurrin, the first cyanogenic glycoside to be identified, was first isolated), barley, flax, white clover, and cassava, which produces linamarin and lotaustralin.

Amygdalin and a synthetic derivative, laetrile, were investigated as potential drugs to treat cancer and were heavily promoted as alternative medicine; they are ineffective and dangerous.

Some butterfly species, such as the &quot;Dryas iulia&quot; and &quot;Parnassius smintheus&quot;, have evolved to use the cyanogenic glycosides found in their host plants as a form of protection against predators through their unpalatability.

====Flavonoid glycosides====
Here, the aglycone is a flavonoid. Examples of this large group of glycosides include:
*Hesperidin (aglycone: hesperetin, glycone: elakkia rutinose)
*Naringin (aglycone: naringenin, glycone: rutinose)
*Rutin (aglycone: quercetin, glycone: rutinose)
*Quercitrin (aglycone: quercetin, glycone: rhamnose)

Among the important effects of flavonoids are their antioxidant effect. They are also known to decrease capillary fragility.

====Phenolic glycosides====
Here, the aglycone is a simple phenolic structure. An example is arbutin found in the Common Bearberry &quot;Arctostaphylos uva-ursi&quot;. It has a urinary antiseptic effect.

====Saponins====

These compounds give a permanent froth when shaken with water. They also cause hemolysis of red blood cells. Saponin glycosides are found in liquorice. Their medicinal value is due to their expectorant, corticoid and anti-inflammatory effects. Steroid saponins are important starting material for the production of semi-synthetic glucocorticoids and other steroid hormones such as progesterone; for example in Dioscorea wild yam the sapogenin diosgenin, in the form of its glycoside dioscin. The ginsenosides are triterpene glycosides and ginseng saponins from &quot;Panax ginseng&quot; (Chinese ginseng) and &quot;Panax quinquefolius&quot; (American ginseng). In general, the use of the term saponin in organic chemistry is discouraged, because many plant constituents can produce foam, and many triterpene-glycosides are amphipolar under certain conditions, acting as a surfactant. More modern uses of saponins in biotechnology are as adjuvants in vaccines: Quil A and its derivative QS-21, isolated from the bark of Quillaja saponaria Molina, to stimulate both the Th1 immune response and the production of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) against exogenous antigens make them ideal for use in subunit vaccines and vaccines directed against intracellular pathogens as well as for therapeutic cancer vaccines but with the aforementioned side-effect of hemolysis. Saponins are also natural ruminal antiprotozoal agents that are potential to improve ruminal microbial fermentation reducing ammonia concentrations and methane production in ruminant animals.

====Steroid glycosides (cardiac glycosides)====

In these glycosides, the aglycone part is a steroid nucleus. These glycosides are found in the plant genera &quot;Digitalis&quot;, &quot;Scilla&quot;, and &quot;Strophanthus&quot;. They are used in the treatment of heart diseases, e.g., congestive heart failure (historically as now recognised does not improve survivability; other agents are now preferred) and arrhythmia.

====Steviol glycosides====

These sweet glycosides found in the stevia plant &quot;Stevia rebaudiana&quot; Bertoni have 40–300 times the sweetness of sucrose. The two primary glycosides, stevioside and rebaudioside A, are used as natural sweeteners in many countries. These glycosides have steviol as the aglycone part. Glucose or rhamnose-glucose combinations are bound to the ends of the aglycone to form the different compounds.

====Iridoid glycosides====
These contain an iridoid group; e.g. aucubin, geniposidic acid, theviridoside, loganin, catalpol.

====Thioglycosides====
As the name contains the prefix thio-, these compounds contain sulfur. Examples include sinigrin, found in black mustard, and sinalbin, found in white mustard.

<text>USS &quot;Goldsborough&quot; (DDG-20) was a &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;–class guided missile-armed destroyer. It was named for Rear Admiral Louis M. Goldsborough USN (1805–1877).

== Ship history ==

=== Construction ===
&quot;Goldsborough&quot; was laid down by the Puget Sound Bridge and Drydock Company at Seattle in Washington on 3 January 1961, was launched on 15 December 1961 by Mrs. Alan Bible, wife of U.S. Senator Alan Bible of Nevada, and commissioned on 9 November 1963, Captain Charles D. Allen, Jr., in command.

=== 1960s and 70s ===
&quot;Goldsborough&quot; joined the Pacific Fleet on 25 December 1963, as a unit of Cruiser-Destroyer Force with her home port at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

After her shakedown tests out of Puget Sound, the new guided missile destroyer arrived at Pearl Harbor on 14 February 1964. Following qualification and acceptance tests, she sailed on 18 April for Sydney, Australia, for the &quot;Coral Sea&quot; celebration and returned to Pearl Harbor on 1 June. She operated in Hawaiian waters in the summer and early fall, and went underway on 23 November for Yokosuka and her first West Pacific deployment. After operations strengthening the 7th Fleet during the escalating war in Vietnam, &quot;Goldsborough&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor for anti-submarine warfare training. In June 1965, she was outfitted with a capsule retrieval device and participated in the Gemini IV Space Program as back up Pacific recovery ship.

The guided missile destroyer headed for the Orient once more on 9 February 1966 to bolster the 7th Fleet. In April she provided gunfire support for Operation &quot;Binh Phu I firing about 600 rounds of 5-inch ammunition at Viet Cong troop concentrations and buildings. During the last half of the month she screened attack carriers at Yankee Station. Next came SEATO exercises in May and duty as station ship at Hong Kong in June. On 26 June &quot;Goldsborough&quot; was again off Vietnam on picket station. She sailed for Hawaii on 16 July and reached Pearl Harbor on the 23d.

While in berth at Pearl Harbor on 24 November 1965, an anti-submarine torpedo was discharged from the ship accidentally and hit the pier.

In August 1966, &quot;Goldsborough&quot; entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for overhaul and extensive modification. In 1967 she participated in &quot;Operation Sea Dragon&quot;, designed to interdict the North Vietnamese lines of supply into the Republic of Vietnam, and provided Naval Gunfire Support along the Vietnamese DMZ. During this deployment &quot;Goldsborough&quot; fired nearly 10,000 rounds in support of allied forces and avoided over 800 rounds of hostile fire without damage to the ship. She was awarded the Naval Unit Commendation for exceptionally meritorious service in Vietnamese waters from 29 August 1967 to 17 February 1968 upon her return to Pearl Harbor.

In November 1968 &quot;Goldsborough&quot; made her fourth Western Pacific deployment in five years, participating in eighty-eight gunfire missions in support of Vietnam, Republic of Korea, and U. S. Marine and Army forces.

In 1969 &quot;Goldsborough&quot; participated in the Apollo 11 Recovery Mission. The command module &quot;Columbia&quot; splashed down about 200 nautical miles south of Johnston Island at 12:50 GMT 24 July 1969.

After a yard period in 1970, &quot;Goldsborough&quot; made a fifth West-Pac tour, departing Pearl in August and returning in February 1971. Again she provided Naval Gunfire Support for allied troops, and carried out carrier escort duties in the Gulf of Tonkin. Later that year she visited Portland, Oregon, for the 1971 Rose Festival.

In September 1971 &quot;Goldsborough&quot; departed on her sixth deployment to the Western Pacific, providing Naval Gunfire Support for allied ground troops and performing carrier escort services.

In early 1972 she was assigned to the recovery Task Force for Apollo 16. Departing again on 13 October 1972 for her seventh deployment to the Western Pacific, this would be her last trip to the &quot;gunline&quot; of Vietnam. On 19 December, while conducting a combat mission &quot;Goldsborough&quot; was hit by coastal artillery fire. The shore battery put a hole five feet wide through an upper deck, killing three sailors and wounding several others. The ship&#x27;s crew received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for service between October 1972 and February 1973. The ship returned to Pearl Harbor in May 1973.

In mid-1976 after leaving port in Singapore, and conducting Shellback initiations, the &quot;Goldsborough&quot; was ordered to the Indian Ocean with the Ranger Task Force in response to the Operation Entebbe. She was low on supplies during the initial days in the Indian Ocean, but supply ships soon caught up with the group. The Ranger Task force remained on station for approximately 30 days showing the flag.

=== 1980s ===
In November 1982, a seaman was killed when heavy seas tossed him against a stanchion. He was the only fatality when Hurricane Iwa struck Hawaii.

In 1988 the &quot;Goldsborough&quot; deployed with a battlegroup centered around the aircraft carrier &quot;Carl Vinson&quot;, CVN-70. The battlegroup supported Operation Earnest Will, conducting missions in and around the Straits of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf. &quot;Goldsborough&quot; had received the New Threat Upgrade (NTU), giving her advanced sensor and communications capabilities. As such the ship frequently was assigned to the Straits of Hormuz, Eastern Patrol Area (SOHEPA) to monitor air activity inside Iranian borders. At the end of the deployment, &quot;Goldsborough&quot; made port visits to Pattaya Beach, Thailand, Hong Kong, and Subic Bay in the Philippines.&quot;Goldsborough&quot; suffered minor damage while passing through Typhoon Roy en route to Hong Kong.

=== Decommissioning ===
&quot;Goldsborough&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 29 April 1993. The ship was sold to Australia on 17 September 1993 for US $2,337,462. The Royal Australian Navy intended to remove equipment from the ship to establish training facilities for maintenance personnel from their s (derivatives of the &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class). At the time, most training was conducted in the United States; as such it was expensive to continually fly sailors between the United States and Australia, and with the &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; class phasing out of service, was likely to be terminated anyway. &quot;Goldsborough&quot; would also be used as a source of spare parts for the &quot;Perth&quot; class.

The ship was towed from Hawaii to Australia at a cost of A$559,706, and arrived in Sydney on 2 February 1994, then was berthed at Fleet Base East. A four-man team set about removing equipment for installation at the new training facility, and for the Australian destroyers. While in Australian hands, the team painted the number 40 on the bow, filling a gap in the pennant number sequence for their three destroyers. After all usable equipment had been stripped, &quot;Goldsborough&quot; was sold to an Indian company in August 1994 for ship breaking.

<text>The voiceless alveolar, dental and postalveolar plosives (or stops) are types of consonantal sounds used in almost all spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents voiceless dental, alveolar, and postalveolar plosives is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1. The voiceless dental plosive can be distinguished with the underbridge diacritic, and the postalveolar with a retraction line, , and the extIPA has a double underline diacritic which can be used to explicitly specify an alveolar pronunciation, .

The sound is a very common sound cross-linguistically. Most languages have at least a plain , and some distinguish more than one variety. Some languages without a are colloquial Samoan (which also lacks an ), Abau, and Nǁng of South Africa.

There are only a few languages which distinguish dental and alveolar stops, Kota, Toda, Venda and many Australian Aboriginal languages being a few of them; certain varieties of Hiberno-English also distinguish them (with [t̪] being the local realisation of the Standard English phoneme /θ/, represented by ⟨th⟩).

==Features==


Here are features of the voiceless alveolar stop:
* There are three specific variants of :
** Dental, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the upper teeth, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;.
** Denti-alveolar, which means it is articulated with the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, and the tip of the tongue behind upper teeth.
** Alveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;.

<text>The World Dance Council Ltd (WDC), is a registered limited company, the legal successor to the &quot;International Council of Ballroom Dancing&quot;, and was established at a meeting organized by Phillip J. S. Richardson on 22 September 1950 in Edinburgh, Scotland. From 1996 to 2006 the WDC was known as the &quot;World Dance &amp; Dance Sport Council Ltd&quot; (WD&amp;DSC). The stated mission of the World Dance Council is to inspire, stimulate and promote excellence in education for the World Dance Council and Amateur League (WDC and AL) community.

The primary objective, at the time of its formation, was to provide an agreed basis for holding world championships in competitive ballroom dance. That objective has been achieved. Initially consisting of nine European countries and three others, today the WDC has become the leading authority on professional dance competitions, with members in numerous countries throughout the world. Each country is allowed one vote. As of 2006, there are 59 members. Its governing body, the Presidium, consists of a President and a number of Vice-Presidents. In 2014 seven Vice Presidents were elected.

WDC includes the Competitive Dance Committee, the Dancesation Committee, and a private public partnership agreement with the WDC Amateur League (WDCAL).

== Mode of operation ==
The WDC is democratic in its operation. All major decisions are taken on the basis of one full member, one vote. The full members are (with a few exceptions) individual countries. There are some Affiliate members, such as the Ballroom Dancers Federation International. The WDC operates through a general council and two committees:

* The World Competitive Dance Committee regulates professional competitive dancing and all matters to do with competitions and their regulations.
* The Dancesation Committee deals with all matters of the dance profession that relate to the activities of Dance Schools and Dance Teachers and all other forms of dance like performing arts, hip Hop, Argentine Tango to name but a few. It does not regulate social dance directly. That is the business of individual organisers.
* The WDC Amateur League was founded in 2007. It regulates and designates the World and continental Amateur championships and licenses and regulates Amateur Dancing.

Each member country in the WDC has its own national organisation, such as the British Dance Council, which acts as a forum for the interested parties in that country. The national bodies decide on their delegates to the WDC. The WDC also operates a WDC National Dance Council system in certain countries, which allows a multi-member system within that NDC, fostering the co-operation of major dance organisations in these countries.

== WDC events ==
These events are under WDC regulation, but organised in various countries each year.

*World Championship – Professional Ballroom
*World Championship – Professional Latin
*World Championship – Professional 10-Dance
*European Championship – Professional 10-Dance
*European Championship – Professional Latin

There are also other events, which are licensed to organising countries, and are open entry.
*WDC Amateur League Open Amateur World Championships &amp; Professional Cups.
*World Masters Latin
*WDC World Cup. In 2009, this event in Shenzhen, China had over 2000 participants.
In the regulations, the facility is also available for professional competitions in:
*Ballroom Show Dance
*Latin American Show Dance

=== WDC competition rules ===
# The WDC Championships are open championships.
# The national bodies nominate their best available couples, and only two couples are permitted from any one country. Additionally 3 Wild Cards from the World Series Ranking List are invited. WDC registered competitors can take part as open entries.

<doc id="518911" wikidata="Q68394" url="?curid=518911" title="Helmut Hirsch">
<text>Helmut Hirsch (; January 27, 1916 – June 4, 1937) was a German Jewish artist and activist who was executed for his part in a bombing plot intended to destabilize the German Reich. While a full and accurate account of the plot is unknown, his targets were understood to be the Nazi Party headquarters in Nuremberg, and/or the plant where the antisemitic weekly propaganda newspaper &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; was printed.

==Early life==
Hirsch was the elder of two children of Marta Neuburger Hirsch and Siegfried Hirsch. In 1935, after the Nuremberg Laws excluded Jews from German universities, he moved to Prague, then capital of Czechoslovakia, where he enrolled as a student of architecture at the &quot;Deutsche Technische Hochschule&quot; (German Institute of Technology).

==The Black Front==
Shortly after arriving in Prague, Hirsch became involved in the Black Front, a nationalist group of anti-Hitler German expatriates who advocated Strasserism. He was encouraged to introduce himself to its head, Otto Strasser, by his mentor, Tusk (Eberhard Köbel). Tusk had been a leader of &quot;Deutsche Jungenschaft&quot;, a branch of the German youth movement &quot;(Bündische Jugend&quot;) to which Hirsch belonged. The &quot;Jungenschaft&quot; itself was outlawed in 1935 and Tusk escaped arrest by fleeing to London.

Hirsch&#x27;s family joined him in Prague in 1936, after his sister, Kaete, graduated from &quot;gymnasium&quot; (high school) and, like him, was forbidden to attend a German university. By then, he was deeply enmeshed in clandestine Black Front activities, which he kept secret from his family.

On December 20, 1936, after telling his family he was going skiing with friends, he returned to Germany with a travel permit obtained on the false premise that he was visiting his mother, who he claimed was ill. In his naiveté, he did not realize German authorities knew his family had moved to Prague. It is likely that German agents in Prague had been watching him for some months, but were unable to arrest him while he remained on Czech soil.

Hirsch&#x27;s handler was Strasser&#x27;s right-hand man, Heinrich Grunov, who used the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Dr. Beer. According to the plan, Hirsch was to place two suitcases containing explosives at one or two sites in Nuremberg. The suggested targets were the Nazi Party headquarters and the office or printing plant of &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;.

Grunov instructed Hirsch to buy a round-trip ticket from Prague to his hometown, Stuttgart, but to travel only as far as Nuremberg. There he was to meet a contact, who would give him baggage claim tickets for the two suitcases, which had been smuggled into Germany. Instead, he went on to Stuttgart, where he had arranged to meet an old friend. According to letters he wrote to his family from prison, he was wavering in his commitment to the plot and hoped his friend would talk him out of the attack.

==Arrest and imprisonment==
Hirsch arrived in Stuttgart late in the evening of December 20. When his friend failed to meet him as arranged, he checked into the Hotel Pelikan, across the street from the railway station. In the early hours of the morning of December 21, agents of the Gestapo arrested him in his hotel room.

Hirsch was interrogated, first in Stuttgart, then after his transfer to Berlin&#x27;s Plötzensee Prison. He was charged with conspiracy to commit high treason, and was indicted for possession of explosives with criminal intent, despite the fact that he had no explosives at the time of his arrest. Hirsch was held in solitary confinement for nine weeks while awaiting trial. He was permitted to communicate with his family or relatives who still lived in Germany. A letter he wrote to his uncle, in Stuttgart, was held back by censors.

==Trial==

Testimony at the trial made it clear that there was at least one double agent in the Black Front, who had informed on Hirsch. A witness for the prosecution described the plot in detail that no one but a trusted member of the Black Front could have known. Under questioning, Hirsch did not deny involvement in the plot, though the public defender assigned to his case argued that he should be acquitted since he had never carried it out. When asked whether he would, if given the chance, have attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler, Hirsch acknowledged he would.

Although Hitler was never a target of the plot, Hirsch&#x27;s response gave rise to rumors printed in the international press that Hitler&#x27;s assassination had been Hirsch&#x27;s goal.

Hirsch was found guilty and condemned to death. His friend was acquitted. Although the proceedings of the trial remained secret, the verdict was made public. It was only upon hearing on the radio on March 20 that &quot;the stateless Jew, Helmut Hirsch,&quot; had been condemned to death that his family learned what had become of him after he left home three months earlier.

==International appeals for clemency==
Hirsch&#x27;s family and friends launched a campaign to free him, or at least have his sentence commuted to life in prison. The International Red Cross, the Society of Friends, and an international association of lawyers made appeals on his behalf. A human rights organization convinced the government of Norway to offer him asylum if the Germans would release him. An appeal was made to the League of Nations, and the case was brought up in the House of Commons in London.
Among the most promising avenues was the intervention of the United States. Hirsch&#x27;s father, Siegfried, had lived in the United States for about ten years before his marriage in 1914. He became a naturalized American citizen before returning to Germany. During World War I, Siegfried lived with his wife and two children in the German state of Alsace. At the end of the war, when Alsace became part of France, the family moved to Stuttgart. Through a bureaucratic mix-up, the exact nature of which is unclear, Siegfried Hirsch&#x27;s American citizenship was rescinded, rendering the entire family &quot;stateless persons&quot;. Even though Hirsch was born in Germany and lived in Stuttgart for most of his life, he never held German citizenship.

Hirsch&#x27;s cousin, George Neuburger, who had moved to New York, enlisted the aid of an American lawyer, Irving S. Ottenberg, who was married to Hirsch&#x27;s father&#x27;s first cousin. Ottenberg petitioned to have Siegfried&#x27;s citizenship reinstated. Their appeal was initially rejected, but a month later the decision was reversed. On April 22, 1937, by virtue of his father&#x27;s newly restored citizenship, Helmut Hirsch was also declared an American citizen, albeit he&#x27;d never set foot on American soil.

==American diplomacy==
Hirsch&#x27;s American citizenship immediately changed the situation. William E. Dodd, the American ambassador in Berlin, was instructed by Secretary of State Cordell Hull to intervene on Hirsch&#x27;s behalf. Dodd chronicled his efforts in his diary. These included meetings with Konstantin von Neurath, the German Foreign Minister, and Otto Meissner, a key aide of Hitler.

Even with the force of American diplomacy, Hitler refused Dodd&#x27;s eleventh-hour request that Hirsch&#x27;s life be spared. His execution by decapitation was carried out at 6:00 am, June 4, 1937. His sister, Katie Sugarman (Kaete Hirsch), died in 2016 having moved to the United States and possibly spared from the Nazi regime due to her family&#x27;s immediate entry due to her brother.

<doc id="518912" wikidata="Q1471612" url="?curid=518912" title="Grumman C-1 Trader">
<text>The Grumman C-1 Trader (TF prior to 1962) is a carrier onboard delivery (COD) variant of the Grumman S-2 Tracker. It was replaced by a similar version of the Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye, the Grumman C-2 Greyhound. It entered service in 1956 and was retired in 1988, with 87 aircraft produced.

==Design and development==
The C-1 Trader grew out of a need by the United States Navy for a new anti-submarine airplane. In response to this Grumman began development on a prototype twin-engine, high-wing aircraft which it designated the G-89. In 1952 the Navy designated this aircraft the XS2F-1 and flew it for the first time on December 4 that year. During the rest of the 1950s three major variants emerged, the C-1 Trader being one of them. The C-1 (originally the TF-1, for &quot;Trainer&quot;, a secondary role) was outfitted to carry nine passengers or of cargo and first flew in January 1955.

==Operational history==

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s the C-1 Trader carried mail and supplies to aircraft carriers on station in the Pacific Ocean during the Vietnam War and also served as a trainer for all-weather carrier operations. Over its production life 87 C-1 Traders were built, of which four were converted into EC-1A Tracer electronic countermeasures aircraft. The last C-1 was retired from USN service in 1988; it was the second-to-last radial-engine aircraft in U.S. military service (The last C-131 wasn&#x27;t retired until 1990). As of 2010, approximately ten were still airworthy in civil hands, operating as warbirds.

In 1956 the U.S. Marine Corps Test Unit Number 1 (MCTU #1) tested the concept of using the TF-1 variant as a vehicle for inserting reconnaissance teams behind enemy lines. “On 9 July 1956 MCTU Recon Marines became the first to parachute from a TF-1. Less than three weeks later, four recon parachutists launched from the USS &quot;Bennington&quot;, which was 70 miles at sea, and jumped on a desert drop zone near El Centro California, some 100 miles inland. For the first time in Marine Corps and Naval Aviation history, the technique of introducing recon personnel off a carrier sea base to an inland objective had successfully been tested.”

In August 2010, Brazilian Naval Aviation announced that it would buy and modernize eight C-1 airframes to serve in carrier onboard delivery (COD) and aerial refueling roles for use on its aircraft carrier &quot;São Paulo&quot;. In 2011 contract was signed with Marsh Aviation to convert four ex-US Navy C-1A Trader airframes into KC-2 Turbo Traders. The first KC-2 prototype flight was expected for November 2017 and the delivery of the first operational aircraft was scheduled for December 2018; in 2014 the contract was reaffirmed, but by 2023, with no aircraft having been delivered and &quot;São Paulo&quot; long since having been stricken, the contract was cancelled.

<doc id="518913" wikidata="Q205295" url="?curid=518913" title="Longhorn beetle">
<text>The longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae), also known as long-horned or longicorns (whose larvae are often referred to as roundheaded borers), are a large family of beetles, with over 35,000 species described. 

Most species are characterized by antennae as long as or longer than the beetle&#x27;s body. A few species have short antennae (e.g., &quot;Neandra brunnea&quot;), making them difficult to distinguish from related families such as Chrysomelidae. &quot;Cerambycidae&quot; comes from a Greek mythological figure: after an argument with nymphs, the shepherd Cerambus is transformed into a large beetle with horns.

Longhorn beetles are found on all continents except Antarctica.

==Description==
Other than the typical long antennal length, the most consistently distinctive feature of adults of this family is that the antennal sockets are located on low tubercles on the face; other beetles with long antennae lack these tubercles, and cerambycids with short antennae still possess them. They otherwise vary greatly in size, shape, sculpture, and coloration. A number of species mimic ants, bees, and wasps, though a majority of species are cryptically colored. The titan beetle (&quot;Titanus giganteus&quot;) from northeastern South America is often considered the largest insect (though not the heaviest, and not the longest including legs), with a maximum known body length of just over .

Larvae are long, elongate in shape and lightly sclerotised. The prothorax is often enlarged and the sides of the body have lateral swellings (ampullae). The head is usually retracted into the prothorax and bears well-sclerotised mouthparts. Larval legs range from moderately developed to absent. The spiracles are always annular.
==Biology==
=== Diet ===
All known longhorn beetle larvae feed on plant tissue such as stems, trunks, or roots of both herbaceous and woody plants, often in injured or weak trees. A few species are serious pests. The larvae, called roundheaded borers, bore into wood, where they can cause extensive damage to either living trees or untreated lumber (or, occasionally, to wood in buildings; the old-house borer, &quot;Hylotrupes bajulus&quot;, is a particular problem indoors).

Many longhorns locate and recognize potential hosts by detecting chemical attractants, including monoterpenes (compounds released en masse by woody plants when stressed), ethanol (another compound emitted by damaged plant material), and even bark beetle pheromones. Many scolytine weevils share the cerambycid&#x27;s niche of weakened or recently deceased trees; thus, by locating scolytinids, a suitable host can likely be located as well. The arrival of cerambycid larvae is often detrimental to a population of scolytinids, as the cerambycid larvae will typically either outcompete them with their greater size and mobility, or act as direct predators of them (this latter practice is less common, but has been observed in several species, notably &quot;Monochamus carolinensis&quot;). Cerambycids, in turn, have been found to play a role in attracting other wood-borers to a host. Borgemeister, et al. 1998, recorded that cerambycid activity in girdled twigs released volatiles attractive to some bostrichids, especially &quot;Prostephanus truncatus&quot;. A few cerambycids, such as &quot;Arhopalus&quot; sp., are adapted to take advantage of trees recently killed or injured by forest fires by detecting and pursuing smoke volatiles.

Adults of Lamiinae, most Lepturinae and some Cerambycinae also feed. Adults of Parandrinae, Prioninae and Spondylidinae do not feed. In those taxa with feeding adults, common foods are nectar, pollen, fruit and sap exudates. Some (mainly Lamiinae) feed on bark, plant stems, needles or developing cones. Roots are consumed by larvae and sometimes also adults of soil-dwelling &quot;Dorcadion&quot;. The genus &quot;Leiopus&quot; is known to feed on fungi. Lastly, the genus &quot;Elytroleptus&quot; is unusual in having carnivorous adults, which prey on lycid beetles.

=== Pollination ===
In addition to feeding on other plant tissue, some species feed on pollen or nectar and may act as pollinators. Assessing the efficacy of beetle pollinators is difficult. Even if pollination of one species by beetles is shown, that same beetle may also act as a flower predator toward other species. In some cases, beetles may act as both pollinators and predators on the same flowers.

Flowers specializing in pollination by beetles typically display a particular set of traits, but pollination by longhorn beetles is not limited to these cantharophilous flowers. A review of angiosperm pollination by beetles shows that Cerambycidae, along with Curculionidae and Scarabaeidae, contains many taxa that are pollinators for not only specialist but also generalist systems.

Beetles in the New Zealand genus &quot;Zorion&quot; are known to feed on pollen and have a specialized structure similar to that of pollen baskets found in bees. Species in this genus are thought to be important pollinator species for native plants such as harakeke. 

Some orchid species have been found to be largely reliant on longhorn beetles for pollination. The species &quot;Alosterna tabacicolor&quot; was found to be the main pollinator of a rare orchid species (&quot;Dactylorhiza fuchsii&quot;) in Poland. Another rare orchid &quot;Disa forficaria,&quot; found in the Cape Floristic Region in South Africa, relies on the species &quot;Chorothyse hessei&quot; for pollination. &quot;D. forficaria&quot; uses sexual deception targeting male &quot;C. hessei&quot;, possibly indicating a long history of co-evolution with longhorn beetle pollinators.

The proportion of longhorn beetle species that act as pollinators is unknown. The fact that two species of longhorn species from distinct subfamilies (Lepturinae and Cerambycinae) found on different continents both with significant roles as pollinators could suggest that some capacity for pollination may be common among longhorn beetles. 
===Predators===
====Parasitoids====
In North America some native cerambycids are the hosts of &quot;Ontsira mellipes&quot; (a parasitoid wasp in the family Braconidae). &quot;O. mellipes&quot; may be useful in controlling a forestry pest in this same family, &quot;Anoplophora glabripennis&quot;, that is invasive in North America.

==Classification==

As with many large families, different authorities have tended to recognize many different subfamilies, or sometimes split subfamilies off as separate families entirely (e.g., Disteniidae, Oxypeltidae, and Vesperidae); there is thus some instability and controversy regarding the constituency of the Cerambycidae. There are few truly defining features for the group as a whole, at least as adults, as there are occasional species or species groups which may lack any given feature; the family and its closest relatives, therefore, constitute a taxonomically difficult group, and relationships of the various lineages are still poorly understood. The oldest unambiguous fossils of the family are &quot;Cretoprionus&quot; and &quot;Sinopraecipuus&quot; from Yixian Formation of Inner Mongolia and Liaoning, China, dating to the Aptian stage of the Early Cretaceous, approximately 122 million years ago. The former genus was assigned to the subfamily Prioninae in its original description, while the latter could not be placed in any extant subfamily. &quot;Qitianniu&quot; from the mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber of Myanmar, dating to approximately 100 million years ago, also could not be placed in any extant subfamily.

===Subfamilies===
The subfamilies of Cerambycidae are:

* Apatophyseinae (included in Bouchard 2011 but not Švácha 2014)
* Cerambycinae 
* Dorcasominae (Švácha 2014 includes Apatophyseinae in Dorcasominae)
* Lamiinae 
* Lepturinae 
* Necydalinae 
* Parandrinae 
* Prioninae 
* Spondylidinae (including former Aseminae )
Most species (90.5%) are concentrated in the Cerambycinae and Lamiinae subfamilies.

<text>USS &quot;Tattnall&quot; (DDG-19) was a &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class guided missile-armed destroyer of the United States Navy. She was named for Commodore Josiah Tattnall III USN (1794–1871) – also commandant of the CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, and an admiral in the Confederate States Navy – who made the adage &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; a part of American history.

&quot;Tattnall&quot; was laid down by Avondale Marine at Avondale, Louisiana on 14 November 1960, launched on 26 August 1961 by Mrs. Mary Adams Mason and commissioned on 13 April 1963 at Charleston, S.C.

==1960s==
Following commissioning, &quot;Tattnall&quot; conducted sea trials out of Charleston and tested her Tartar and RUR-5 ASROC missile systems in the Charleston, Jacksonville, FL, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, operating areas. Late in August, she returned to Charleston before departing again for shakedown training in the West Indies. The guided-missile destroyer returned to Charleston once again on 20 October for post-shakedown availability. Training, exercises, and local operations followed from early February until late April 1964. After a visit to New York City late in April, she resumed operations out of Charleston.

On 8 September, she got underway for her first overseas cruise during which she participated in NATO Exercise &quot;Teamwork,&quot; an operation conducted in the Norwegian Sea and in the Bay of Biscay. The exercise ended early in October, and the warship put into Portsmouth, England, on the 3rd. &quot;Tattnall&quot; moved from there to Edinburgh, Scotland, for a two- or three-day visit in October, before heading back to the United States. On the 22nd, she reentered Charleston and resumed normal operations.

Following missile firings and gunnery practice in the San Juan operating area, &quot;Tattnall&quot; departed the western Atlantic on 7 December for her first deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. On 14 December, she reached the Straits of Gibraltar and became a unit of the 6th Fleet. While in the Mediterranean, she visited Tunis, Tunisia in northern Africa; Genoa, and Naples in Italy; Marseilles and Theoule in France; and Barcelona in Spain. She also participated in several exercises with other units of the 6th Fleet and with ships of foreign navies. On 4 March 1965, she retransited the Straits of Gibraltar and headed back toward the United States.

The guided-missile destroyer made Charleston on 14 March and began an availability period in preparation for her participation in projects for the Chief of Naval Operations. She completed the availability on 19 April and put to sea to conduct Fleet Research Project Number 69. She finished her work on the research project on 7 May and returned to Charleston. &quot;Tattnall&quot; resumed normal operations until 30 August when she put to sea to conduct the first of two additional tasks for the Chief of Naval Operations. This project, designated D/S 336, sought to insure her combat readiness prior to the second project, 0/S 102. During project D/S 336, &quot;Tattnall&quot;&#x27;s crew averaged 10 to 12 hours a day at general quarters as they tracked single and multiple-plane air raids and simulated missile firings. Weather conditions hampered the gathering of data so that project D/S 336 was not concluded until 2 October. She put to sea again on 4 October for project O/S 102, a multi-phase test of the combat effectiveness of the &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class guided-missile destroyer. She completed the project early in December and returned to Charleston for availability, holiday leave, and preparation for another Mediterranean deployment.

On 15 February 1966, &quot;Tattnall&quot; departed Charleston once more to join the 6th Fleet. From 27 February to 3 March, she participated in Exercise &quot;Fairgame IV,&quot; a Franco-American exercise conducted in the western Mediterranean. On 17 May, she conducted an intelligence surveillance of Russian warships. In June, she joined in another western Mediterranean exercise, &quot;Deep Six.&quot; On this cruise, she added Rhodes, Majorca, Thessalonica and Volas, Greece, and Istanbul, Turkey, to her list of ports visited. On 1 July, the warship put to sea from Palma de Majorca and headed back toward Charleston, where she arrived on 22 August.

Upon arrival, &quot;Tattnall&quot; immediately began her first major overhaul since commissioning. She remained in Charleston Naval Shipyard from 22 August 1966 until 7 March 1967. After exiting the shipyard, she resumed local operations along the southern Atlantic coast of the United States and in the West Indies until early July. Following a week-long visit to New York City from 12 to 19 July, the guided-missile destroyer returned to Charleston to prepare for her third Mediterranean cruise. That deployment lasted through January 1968; and, by early February, &quot;Tattnall&quot; was back in Charleston. She resumed normal operations along the southeastern coast of the United States and in the West Indies until June, when she returned to Europe. After a stop in the Azores and a visit to Germany for the &quot;Kiel Week&quot; celebration, &quot;Tattnall&quot; reentered the Mediterranean for another tour of duty with the 6th Fleet. The warship remained in the Mediterranean until mid-November and then returned to the east coast and local operations.

&quot;Tattnall&quot; continued to operate from Charleston until late July 1969, when she shifted home ports to Mayport, Fla. She arrived in Mayport on 29 July and conducted normal operations until September. From 2 to 24 September, the guided-missile destroyer participated in NATO Operation &quot;Peacekeeper.&quot; On the 24th, she entered Amsterdam in the Netherlands for a week, then put to sea for hunter-killer operations and visits to the European ports of Hamburg, Bergen, Edinburgh, and Le Havre. She reentered Mayport on 10 December 1969.

==1970s==
After four months operating out of Mayport, &quot;Tattnall&quot; steamed north to Chesapeake Bay, where she assisted in tests conducted at Randle Cliffs, Md., by scientists of the Naval Research Laboratory. She visited Newport, R.I., in mid-month and returned to Mayport on the 25th. Following five months of operations and exercises in the vicinity of Mayport, &quot;Tattnall&quot; steamed to Charleston for her second regular overhaul. She remained in Charleston Naval Shipyard until 24 March 1971, when she began post-overhaul trials. On 22 April, she headed back to Mayport and operations in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.

On 16 September 1971, the ship departed Charleston bound for northern Europe and Exercise &quot;Royal Knight.&quot; During that cruise, she visited Rosyth, Scotland, and Rotterdam in the Netherlands before returning to Mayport on 22 October.

In March 1972, &quot;Tattnall&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean once again. She conducted exercises with other units of the 6th Fleet and with ships of foreign navies. The guided-missile destroyer visited Valencia, Spain, Genoa and Naples in Italy, Patras and Athens in Greece, Kusadasi and Iskenderun in Turkey, Sousse, Tunisia, Menton, France, Palma de Majorca, Spain, and Sicily. On 28 August, she changed operational control to the 2nd Fleet and headed for Mayport, where she arrived on 5 September.

&quot;Tattnall&quot; resumed operations from Mayport until 29 May 1973, when she got underway to participate in a joint American-French exercise conducted in the vicinity of Charleston. In late May and early June, she visited Norfolk, Va., and the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md. She returned to Mayport on 18 June. After a month in the Mayport area, &quot;Tattnall&quot; embarked upon her first UNITAS deployment to South America. She visited ports in Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, and Uruguay in between operations and exercises conducted with units of those countries&#x27; navies. On 15 December, she returned to Mayport and resumed exercises in the western Atlantic and upkeep in her home port through July 1974.

On 22 July 1974, she began a two-month restricted availability at Charleston. The &quot;Tattnall&quot; returned to Mayport on 21 September to begin preparations for another Mediterranean deployment. The guided-missile destroyer departed Mayport on 25 November and changed operational control to the 6th Fleet at Rota, Spain, on 5 December. &quot;Tattnall&quot; participated in &quot;special operations&quot; on 9 December following a brief stop at Gaeta, Italy, she put into Barcelona for the holidays on 18 December.

On 6 January 1975, the warship sailed to Rapallo, Italy for an 8-day goodwill visit with local leaders followed by a brief stop in La Spezia to meet with senior Italian Navy officials. &quot;Tattnall&quot; enjoyed a tender availability while in Naples (18 January – 23 February), paused briefly to refuel at Augusta Bay, Sicily, then sailed to Sousse, Tunisia for another visit with local officials on 26 January. A storm in the Gulf of Hammemet forced her to sea on 27 January, but the warship promptly resumed her visit until her departure on 4 March, &quot;Tattnall&quot; sailed to Souda Bay, Crete (6–7 March) where the guided-missile destroyer successfully completed two of three missile firings. Following a routine visit to Palermo, Sicily (9–14 March), she participated in exercises with the en route to join Carrier Task Group 60.2 for operations simulating an opposed passage of the Strait of Messina. After a routine visit to Palma (19 March – 5 April), &quot;Tattnall&quot; and other units of TG 60.2 joined for ASW exercises en route to a training anchorage in Pollensa Bay, Majorca (6–9 April). The guided-missile destroyer refueled from &quot;Neosho&quot; (AO-143) while sailing to Barcelona (10–18 April) where she embarked Rear Admiral Nicholson, Commander, Carrier Striking Group Two for meetings with high ranking Spanish military and civilian dignitaries. &quot;Tattnall&quot; sailed to Sardinia on the 19th with units of TG 60.2 where she participated briefly in the amphibious exercise &quot;Sardinia 75&quot; on the 20th followed by naval gunfire exercises the next two days. Departing Sardinia, the guided-missile destroyer rendezvoused with and the Italian Navy destroyer &quot;Intrepido&quot; (D571) for ASW exercises. &quot;Tattnall&quot; successfully completed an Operational Readiness Examination and conducted exercises prior to passing through the Strait of Gibraltar en route to Rota, Spain (26 April-2 May). On the 5th, the &quot;Tattnall&quot; joined &quot;Leahy&quot; (DLG/CG-16) in Portsmouth, England to sail to Leningrad (12–17 May) in the Soviet Union for a visit in honor of the 30th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe during World War II. The warships interrupted their return passage to Portsmouth, England (23–25 May) for fuel and debriefing with a two-day sojourn in Kiel Germany. &quot;Tattnall&quot; returned to Mayport on 6 June after brief stops in the Azores and Bermuda.

She remained in Mayport until sailing to Newport, Rhode Island on 6 August for three weeks of training midshipmen. Upon return to Mayport on the 29th, she prepared to shift her homeport to Philadelphia for the upcoming regular overhaul. Two days after her arrival in Philadelphia on 4 October 1975, the warship commenced the overhaul that included numerous modifications to her weapons, communication, and engineering equipment. With the overhaul completed as scheduled on 6 August 1976, &quot;Tattnall&quot; returned to Mayport on the 12th in advance of post-overhaul refresher training. She tested weapon systems in Port Everglades during the last week of August then returned to Mayport for further inspections and tests. On 20 September, a Cleveland television station news crew embarked to film for a documentary news program on life in the Navy. &quot;Tattnall&quot; tested the performance of her missile systems at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico then sailed to Guantanamo Bay for refresher training (8 October – 10 November). The guided-missile destroyer returned to Puerto Rico for naval gunfire support qualification prior to her return to her home port of Mayport on 20 November. She received a tender availability alongside and Christmas standdown.

Following participation in the major fleet exercise &quot;Caribex 2–77&quot;, from 29 January to 10 February 1977, &quot;Tattnall&quot; departed on a seven-month deployment with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean on 30 March. She returned to Mayport on 21 October.

&quot;Tattnall&quot; began 1978 as part of the 2nd Fleet &quot;Ready Alert Group&quot; and twice interrupted her holiday leave period on 4 and 7 January to get underway on less than 24 hours notice. During the second of these sorties, she rendezvoused with off Puerto Rico on the 10th. &quot;Tattnall&quot; conducted an underway replenishment alongside the carrier before returning to Mayport a week later. In February, the warship participated in readiness exercises in the Caribbean. During her passage south, she served as flagship for Commander Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 14 and also enjoyed a port visit to Martinique (14–21 February). The guided-missile destroyer returned to Mayport at the beginning of March to prepare for her upcoming deployment to the North Atlantic. On 1 April, &quot;Tattnall&quot; transferred to DESRON 12 and then sailed to Fort Lauderdale for first week of the month for a Chief of Naval Operations project on mine warfare. The warship preparations for deployment included a propulsion examination, naval gunfire support qualification, and highly successful supply management inspection. On 11 June, she completed sea trials and departed Mayport the next day for a deployment with the Standing Naval Forces, Atlantic (SNFL).

Following refueling stops at Bermuda and the Azores, &quot;Tattnall&quot; relieved on 23 June 1978 at the Dutch Naval Base at Den Helder, Netherlands. By the end of August, &quot;Tattnall&quot; visited Rosyth (30 June – 4 July and 14–17 July), Rothesay (13–19 August), and Glasgow (12–22 August) in Scotland; Tromso (21–24 July) and Haakonsvern Naval Base, Bergen (31 July – 6 August) in Norway; and Zeebrugge (26 August – 1 September). On 1 September, the warship, along with other SNFL units, provided screening and gunfire support to amphibious units in the Shetland Islands and Jutland as part of the NATO exercise &quot;Northern Wedding&quot;. &quot;Tattnall&quot; continued her screening duties after a gale forced many of the ships in the exercise to sea before she detached to refuel at Den Helder on the 16th. The exercise ended when the guided-missile destroyer rejoined the amphibious force off Scotland the next day and put into Portsmouth, England on the 19th Engineering problems delayed her departure until 14 October when she rejoined SNFL forces anti-aircraft exercises off western Scotland. &quot;Tattnall&quot; visited Rotterdam, Netherlands (20–26 October); Aarhus (2–5 November) and Copenhagen (10–14 November) in Denmark; Kiel, Germany (18–21 November); and Lisbon, Portugal (2–5 December) before she arrived back at her homeport on 16 December for holiday leave and upkeep.

&quot;Tattnall&quot; received a visit from the Navy Inspector General when the holiday standdown drew to a close on 19 January 1979. An availability (22 January – 15 February) alongside &quot;Yosemite&quot; (AD-19) followed and after successful completion of inspections, the warship got underway on the 16th to join for a week of exercises hampered by bad weather off Jacksonville and the Virginia Capes. The guided-missile destroyer completed her Navy Technical Proficiency Inspection (12–13 March) in between two stints as an Engineering Training School Ship (26 February – 8 March and 26 March to 6 April). On 8 April, members of &quot;Tattnall&quot;″s Rescue and Assistance Detail helped bring a fire that caused significant damage under control in while the pair berthed in Mayport. On 30 April, she entered drydock in Jacksonville Shipyards for painting and minor repairs and returned to Mayport on 12 May ahead of a Command Inspection (21–22 May). On 22 June, over two hundred of the crew&#x27;s family enjoyed a dependents cruise. On 9 July, &quot;Tattnall&quot; set sail from Mayport for midshipman training in Norfolk from 13 to 26 July. Upon return to Mayport, she provided support to the Senior Officers Ship Maintenance and Repair course and conducted a training availability with Fleet Training Center Mayport (6–10 August). On 20 August, the guided-missile destroyer joined Composite Training Unit Exercise (COMPTUEX) 3–79 during which she fired her surface-to-air, surface-to-surface missiles and successfully launched an anti-submarine rocket (ASROC), and a Mark 46 torpedo. She returned to Mayport on the 27th to prepare for an upcoming inspection, but Hurricane David forced the warship to sea on 2 September. Following satisfactory completion of the material inspection, &quot;Tattnall&quot; set sail from Mayport on 1 October for Puerto Rico. During two-weeks of exercises there, which included naval gunfire support qualification at Vieques Island, she served as flagship for DESRON 26.

On 29 October, &quot;Tattnall&quot; began preparations for her deployment to the Middle East, but the context of her deployment changed considerably after a group of militant university students took over the American diplomatic mission in Tehran on 4 November 1979, thus precipitating the Iranian Hostage Crisis that would last until 20 January 1981. Following a combat system review and inspections, the warship conducted sea trials (19–20 November) during which the ship played host to a troop of Mayport-area Boy Scouts and two participants in the Secretary of the Navy&#x27;s Guest Cruise Program. As &quot;Tattnall&quot; completed her long days of preparation for her 27 November departure from Mayport, the ship learned that she had earned six Battle Efficiency Awards for the previous year. During the passage across the Atlantic, the warship fired three missiles during exercises and conducted a &quot;blue water&quot; turnover with near the Azores. After reaching Rota, Spain on 9 December, &quot;Tattnall&quot; joined and Task Group 60.2 for MULTIPLEX 1–80 (14–20 December) then sailed to Genoa, Italy for holiday leave and upkeep.

==1980s==
After departing Genoa on 4 January 1980, the guided-missile destroyer conducted training and an underway replenishment as she sailed south for a port visit to Bari, Italy (9–14 January) in advance of a task group missile exercise at Souda Bay, Crete on the 16th. &quot;Tattnall&quot; remained at a training anchorage in Crete until the 22nd when she got underway for a large battle group replenishment before sailing to Athens (25–31 January) for rest and relaxation. After passing through the Suez Canal on 3 February, the guided-missile destroyer relieved and joined for the passage around the Arabian peninsula. &quot;Tattnall&quot; stopped briefly at Djibouti (7 February) for fuel and replenishment before reaching the Persian Gulf on the 13th. In the Persian Gulf, the guided-missile destroyer remained at sea to defend the Middle East Force flagship and conduct surveillance operations in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. She briefly visited Bahrain (15–17 March) (double check deg log) before pointing homeward. &quot;Tattnall&quot; squeezed a two-day goodwill visit to Berbera, Somalia between stops for fuel in Djibouti (22 and 29 March) prior to transiting the Suez Canal on 3 April. The warship enjoyed a repair availability in Naples (7–22 April), sailed through the Strait of Gibraltar on the 25th and passed a propulsion plant examination while in Rota, Spain (25–27 April). With Commander DESRON 24 embarked and in the company of the Forrestal Battle Group, the guided-missile destroyer reached Mayport on 7 May. The crew enjoyed a post-deployment leave period and the ship underwent an intermediate maintenance availability with &quot;Yosemite&quot; (AD-19) upon return to homeport.

On 2 July, with only fourteen hours notice, &quot;Tattnall&quot; got underway as DESRON 24 flagship of a quick reaction task group that included &quot;Koelsch&quot;, , and . The task group conducted type training in the waters off Key West until the 8th. Upon return to Mayport on the 11th, the ship&#x27;s crew prepared for the annual Nuclear Technical Proficiency Inspection which she passed with outstanding grades in six of seven areas evaluated. After a dependent&#x27;s cruise (7 August), the warship departed Mayport for a goodwill cruise of Latin American under operational control of Combined Joint Task Force Commander, Key West. She refueled at Guatanamo Bay (18 August) before calling on Veracruz, Mexico (23–26 August) and Puerto Cortes, Honduras (30–31 August). The guided-missile destroyer suffered substantial damage from an electrical fire in the after engine room upon her departure from Honduras, but this did not deter her from earning the top score for her class of ship in naval gunfire support qualification at Vieques (7 September). After a brief return to Mayport (11–16 September), &quot;Tattnall&quot; visited Port Everglades (19–21 September) en route to the Atlantic Underwater Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) in the Bahamas (23–25 September) for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercises. Upon her return to Mayport on the 26th, the guided-missile destroyer remained in port, except for type training off Jacksonville (22 October), to concentrate on training and preparations for an upcoming deployment and overhaul. After completion of sea trials (24–26 November), she set sail for Puerto Rican waters on 1 December to participate in gunfire and missile exercises. The warship returned to homeport on the 13th for holiday leave and final preparations for deployment.

In 1981, the &quot;Tattnall&quot; was taken over by Captain P. T. Deutermann who served as captain for a three-year tour of duty. On 12 January 1981, &quot;Tattnall&quot; joined &quot;Blakely&quot; a day after setting sail from Mayport for a passage across the Atlantic plagued by high winds and rough seas. The pair refueled at Bermuda and Rota, then navigated the Strait of Gibraltar on the 24th. &quot;Tattnall&quot; arrived at Port Said, Egypt on the 30th where she embarked Vice Admiral Small, Commander Sixth Fleet for the transit of the Suez Canal the following day. After a stop for fuel in Djibouti (3 February), she joined Task Group 70.9 in the Indian Ocean. Her crew marked the crossing of the equator on the 11th with the traditional rites and rituals. Then the warship put into Diego Garcia (12–14 February) for a tender availability alongside . She rejoined Task Group 70.9 for three days of exercises in the Indian Ocean before heading north to link up with the Battle Group on the 18th for a week-long exercise from which the destroyer briefly took leave to unsuccessfully search for survivors of a mid-air collision between two Navy aircraft. Upon conclusion of exercise &quot;Gonzo 1–81&quot;, &quot;Tattnall&quot; continued operations with &quot;Independence&quot; until the 27th when she departed for the Persian Gulf to relieve &quot;Jonas Ingram&quot; (DD-938) and &quot;Barney&quot; (DDG-6). Assigned to Middle East Force until 18 May, &quot;Tattnall&quot; punctuated her patrol of the Persian Gulf with numerous visits to Bahrain and a port visit to Damman, Saudi Arabia (13–14 May). After &quot;Bigelow&quot; (DD-942) relieved her, the warship again joined &quot;Blakely&quot; for the long passage back to Mayport. On the 26th, &quot;Tattnall&quot; struck an uncharted object as the ship completed her transit of the Suez Canal and suffered damage to the starboard propeller. She put into Malaga, Spain (1–6 June) where divers from repaired the damage and the warship passed through the Straits of Gibraltar on 7 June. &quot;Tattnall&quot; refueled in the Azores and Bermuda, then returned to Mayport on the 18th for a month of upkeep.

On 20 July 1981, &quot;Tattnall&quot; got underway for the ten-day NATO fleet exercise &quot;Ocean Venture&quot; that included large battle group exercises and an opportunity for the guided-missile destroyer to utilize her various weapon systems. After removal of weapons at Charleston, South Carolina (31 July – 4 August), the ship returned to Mayport on 7 August to prepare for a 15-month overhaul. When &quot;Tattnall&quot; departed her homeport on the 26th, the Mk 68 Gun Fire Control System, the MK 32 Surface Vessel Torpedo Tubes, the ASROC launcher, SPG-51 missile fire control radar, the WLR-1 over-the-horizon threat detection radar, and the ULQ-6B electronic countermeasures system had all been removed. Upon arrival in Philadelphia, the warship received a warm welcome from city leaders and hosted 15,000 visitors on 29 and 30 August before she arrived in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on the last day of the month. On 9 September, &quot;Tattnall&quot; moved into dry dock and the crew moved to barracks ship APL-54 for the duration of an overhaul the included installation of the Harpoon anti-ship missile system and the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS).

After completion of her sea trials, &quot;Tattnall&quot; set sail from Philadelphia Naval Shipyard one day ahead of her scheduled 28 November 1982 departure date. She returned to Mayport on 3 December where she began planning and preparation for refresher training. In early April 1983, she tested her weapons systems during trials in Port Everglades and her ASW systems at the AUTEC range in the Bahamas. The guided-missile destroyer conducted missile qualification training at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico and naval gunfire support qualification at Vieques en route to refresher training at Guantanamo. Due to engineering problems &quot;Tattnall&quot; returned to Mayport for two weeks of boiler repairs then returned to Cuba in late June to complete her training. She returned to Mayport in mid-July to prepare for her upcoming deployment.

Following a dependents cruise on 23 September 1983, the warship departed Mayport for the Mediterranean Sea on the 29th. &quot;Tattnall&quot; visited Recife and Salvador, Brazil then joined John F. Kennedy battle group for the passage across the Atlantic. The guided-missile destroyers original schedule called for two months in the Indian Ocean following operations in the Mediterranean, however, resurgent violence in Lebanon between Christian and Druze militia followed by the killing of 241 U.S. Marines in the suicide bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut on 23 October prompted a high-speed transit to the eastern Mediterranean after she changed to 6th Fleet control on the 28th. For the two and half months after her arrival off Beirut on 3 November, &quot;Tattnall&quot; supported the U.S. Multinational Force, occasionally putting in at Haifa, Israel for repairs, rest, and replenishment. On 13, 18, and 19 December, the warship fire her 5-inch guns on Syrian anti-aircraft positions and claimed the destruction of her two assigned targets on the 13th. On 24 January 1984, a fire erupted that required the assistance of &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; (DDG-5), patrolling nearby. &quot;Tattnall&quot; lost all anti-aircraft capability and was handicapped in her ability to fire Harpoon missiles, and so set sail for Naples, Italy to assess the damage. Afterwards the guided-missile destroyer steamed home for extensive repairs, arriving in Mayport on 24 February.

Though she devoted most of her time to repair of fire damage and scheduled repairs to the engineering plant, &quot;Tattnall&quot; did manage to get underway for training from 4–7 June and host the Federal Republic of Germany (West German) destroyer &quot;Mölders&quot; (D186) in August. In October, an unforeseen problem with one of her main engines kept her pierside for a month while General Electric technical representatives and the ship&#x27;s crew made repairs. Following a sea trial in November, &quot;Tattnall&quot; loaded weapons at the Naval Weapons Station Charleston and returned to Mayport until February 1985 for a limited availability for boiler maintenance, to test her combat systems, and conduct major engineering repairs.

She put to sea off Jacksonville the first two weeks of February 1985 to test her combat and fire control systems. An availability at Mayport for further maintenance and repair followed until 15 March when &quot;Tattnall&quot; departed for six weeks of refresher training at Guantanamo Bay. Shortly before leaving Guantanamo Bay, the guided-missile destroyer responded to a call for help from following her collision with an Ecuadoran tanker, but the aircraft carrier managed to get underway without assistance. In early May, &quot;Tattnall&quot; returned to Mayport for a brief maintenance availability prior to sailing to Mobile, Alabama to help celebrate the opening of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway. Thousands of Mobile residents and tourists visited the ship during the early June event. Three weeks of combat system qualifications off Puerto Rico preceded a maintenance and repair availability in July. During this period, &quot;Tattnall&quot; hosted the frigate HMS &quot;Brilliant&quot; (F90). On 13 August, she sailed to Puerto Rico to participate in three weeks of fleet readiness exercises. In September, she returned to Mayport to prepare for her upcoming deployment to the Persian Gulf.

On 7 October 1985, &quot;Tattnall&quot; set sail in company with &quot;Conolly&quot; (DD-979), , and &quot;Boone&quot; (FFG-28). Following brief stops at Bermuda, Rota, and Palma de Majorca, the guided-missile destroyer transited the Suez Canal in late October. In the first week of November, &quot;Tattnall&quot; relieved &quot;Lynde McCormick&quot; (DDG-8) in the Persian Gulf and then entered Bahrain for upkeep, supplies and briefings. In the Persian Gulf, she operated on a radar patrol station in concert with Air Force E-3A AWACS based in Saudi Arabia until January. During that time, the warship also spent Christmas liberty in Al Jubayl, Saudi Arabia, made several port visits to Dubai, and conducted a &quot;passing exercise&quot; that test the guided-missile destroyer&#x27;s ability to communicate with units of the Royal Saudi Navy.

On 24 January 1986, &quot;Tattnall&quot; sailed to the Gulf of Oman for escort operations then returned to the Persian Gulf for further surveillance operations in the first week of February. On 8 February, &quot;Tattnall&quot; visited Karachi, Pakistan for a brief port visit prior to conducting a &quot;passing exercise&quot; with units of the Pakistani Navy in the north Arabian Sea. The guided-missile cruiser conducted more surveillance operations in the Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf en route to Bahrain where the ship enjoyed a five-day port visit prior to moving to a training anchorage on the 22nd to practice engineering and damage control exercises. On 3 March, &quot;Tattnall&quot; departed Bahrain and continued surveillance operations in the Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea, and Red Sea until she transited the Suez Canal on the 17th. During that time, &quot;Luce&quot; (DDG-38) relieved her of duties with Middle East Force on the 7th in the western patrol area of the Gulf of Oman. Following six days of Mediterranean operations, the ship visited Barcelona (22nd–25th), Rota (26th) prior to reaching Mayport on 8 April.

After a four-week standdown, &quot;Tattnall&quot; devoted most of the remainder of the year to maintenance and upkeep. On 18 May, the warship embarked Commander, DESRON 12. She twice got underway in June for engineering training and on 8 July conducted three days of sea trials off Jacksonville. On 11 September, the ship held a dependent&#x27;s cruise a day ahead of commencing an extended maintenance availability. On 18 December, the SPS-40 radar suffered damage when it rotated into span wire rigged for holiday lighting. Although a 23 December fast cruise concluded her availability, the need for a significant amount of work on her underwater hull led to the guided-missile destroyer being towed to Jacksonville Shipyard on 13 January 1987 for three months in drydock. On 9 April, &quot;Tattnall&quot; left drydock and entered Mayport under tow the following day. The ship occupied herself with inspections, sea trials, and a visit to Jacksonville as part of the &quot;Say No to Drugs&quot; program ahead of her 5 June departure for refresher training at Guatanamo Bay.

After a five weeks of training in West Indies waters (9 June – 16 July), she visited Bahamas for two days before returning to Mayport on 21 July 1987. Mobile Training Team from Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (ComNavSurfLant) arrived on the 27th and the ship completed a routine test and inspection the following month before getting underway for a fleet exercise on 21 August. Before the exercise concluded on 4 September, the warship had participated in a successful missile firing as well as naval gunfire support exercises off Puerto Rico. The guided-missile destroyer made a port Honduras (7–8 September) before she put into Mayport on the 13th for a maintenance availability. The ship conducted inspections and training, including an inspection by Commander, DESRON 12, before she completed her availability in early December. Following sea trials (7–11 December), the warship returned to Mayport for holiday leave and upkeep.

On 11 January 1988, &quot;Tattnall&quot; got underway with &quot;Luce&quot; for fleet exercises with a dual-carrier battle group in the Puerto Rican operations area. The guided-missile destroyer then returned to Mayport on the 26th to prepare for her Mediterranean deployment. On 29 February, &quot;Tattnall&quot;, in company with &quot;Luce&quot; and &quot;Vreeland&quot; (FF-1068), commenced a busy passage across the Atlantic. The warship conducted training with a carrier battle group until she detached with to steam independently to the Mediterranean. After the pair transited the Strait of Gibraltar on 11 March, &quot;Tattnall&quot; relieved &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; (DDG-5) on the evening of the 15th. In addition to battle group training and operations, she visited Palma de Majorca (18–25 March), Genoa, Italy (29 March – 5 April) and Villefranche, France (11–15 April) before the battle group moved to a training anchorage at Augusta Bay, Sicily (18–24 April). The warship visited Taranto, Italy (26–29 April) then refueled in Turkey on 1 May in advance of the NATO exercise &quot;Dragon Hammer&quot;. After five days of upkeep in Sicily, &quot;Tattnall&quot; paused at Antalya Turkey (23–26 May) and Haifa (29 May – 3 June) prior to transiting the Dardanelles to Golcuk, Turkey (6–20 June). After two weeks of availability and upkeep, she got underway for the Black Sea, via the Bosporus, where a Soviet ship escorted her to Constanta, Romania (21–24 June). &quot;Tattnall&quot; briefly stopped at Antalya (28–30 June) before entering Haifa for a two-week visit interrupted by local exercises from 12 to 14 July. The ship visited Cannes (26 July – 1 August) and &quot;MacDonough&quot; (DDG-39) relieved &quot;Tattnall&quot; on 14 August during two weeks of upkeep at Gibraltar (4–18 August). The warship returned to Mayport on the 29th and began preparations for the upcoming Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV).

After a fast cruise on the 28th, &quot;Tattnall&quot; visited Wilmington (30 September – 3 October) then sailed to Port Everglades for Navy Appreciation Week (7–15 October). The warship sailed to the Virginia Capes for tracking and live firing exercises on the 18th and 19th then returned to Mayport two days later. After the guided-missile destroyer received a satisfactory report from the INSURV conducted 14 to 18 November she conducted an intermediate availability on the 21st.

On 19 January 1989, &quot;Tattnall&quot; entered drydock for work on her boilers and painting her hull among other upkeep. After sea trials, an availability and a visit to Charleston to load weapons, she returned to Mayport on 19 May. On 19 June, the warship embarked Commander DESRON 12 for Type Commanders Core Training with other ships in the squadron. Following visits to Fort Lauderdale and Freeport, Bahamas she returned to Mayport for Independence Day festivities. On 19 July, &quot;Tattnall&quot; departed for refresher training at Guatanamo Bay. With a Coast Guard detachment embarked, the guided-missile destroyer interdicted a small Haitian sailing vessel with 150 refugees bound for United States. After the Coast Guard evacuated the passengers, &quot;Tattnall&quot; sank the vessel to eliminate a hazard to navigation. She visited Ocho Rios, Jamaica, and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico before returning to Mayport. In early August, &quot;Tattnall&quot; participated in missile firing exercises off the Virginia Capes. On 29 August, the warship got underway for fleet exercises then returned to Mayport for an availability on 18 September. In October, the warships visited Fort Lauderdale and Tampa and she sailed to the AUTEC range for ASW training from 11 to 14 December.

==1990s==
On 21 January 1990, &quot;Tattnall&quot; got underway for three weeks of fleet exercises then returned to Mayport on 15 February to prepare for her overseas deployment. On 8 March, the warship departed Mayport and joined the Dwight D. Eisenhower battle group en route to the Mediterranean. On the 20th, she joined 6th Fleet and participated in &quot;National Week&quot; exercises before conducting turnover at Augusta Bay, Sicily. After enjoying an availability alongside &quot;Sierra&quot; (AD-18) in Naples until 17 April, the warship put into Trieste on the 19th to join vessels from several other NATO countries to form Naval on Call Forces Mediterranean (NAVOCFORMED). The warships conducted joint operations, including NATO operation &quot;Dragon Hammer&quot; as well as port visits to Cagliari, Barcelona, Marseille and Naples. The next couple of months included five French port visits, two visits to ports of call in Algeria, and one in Tunisia. In Algiers, &quot;Tattnall&quot; hosted a reception for diplomatic representatives from around the world. After another availability alongside Sierra, this time in Majorca, the warship visited Toulon (26 July – 1 August) then sailed to the eastern Mediterranean for Operation &quot;Flashing Scimitar&quot;. After Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August, &quot;Tattnall&quot; transited the Suez Canal into the Red Sea in support of Desert Shield on 19 August, 1990.

===Decommissioning and scrapping===
Having been deployed in theater since March, and in any case scheduled for deactivation, &quot;Tattnall&quot; was relieved without turnover by &quot;Sampson&quot; (DDG-10) a week later and she returned to Mayport on 8 September for three weeks of leave and upkeep. The ship visited Fort Lauderdale for Fleet Appreciation Week in mid-October then returned to Mayport to prepare for decommissioning. &quot;Tattnall&quot; was placed out of commission on 18 January 1991, struck from the Navy list on 12 January 1993 and stored at the Inactive Ships Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The old destroyer was sold for scrapping to International Shipbreaking Ltd., Brownsville, Texas, on 10 February 1999, towed to Brownsville by salvage tug Elsbeth III starting 18 March 1999 and dismantled at Brownsville between 12 April 1999 and 22 March 2000.

<text>The Royal Rumble is a professional wrestling event, produced annually since 1988 by WWE, the world&#x27;s largest professional wrestling promotion. It is named after, and centered on, the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. After the inaugural 1988 event aired as a television special on the USA Network, the Royal Rumble has been broadcast via pay-per-view since the 1989 event and livestreaming since the 2015 event. The event is traditionally held in late January, but in 2025, it was held in early February. It is one of WWE&#x27;s five biggest events of the year, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, Survivor Series, and Money in the Bank, referred to as the &quot;Big Five&quot;.

The Royal Rumble match is generally held as the main event of the annual event. There are some exceptions, such as the 1988, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2006, 2013, and 2023 events. In 1988, the main event was a tag team match, while for all the others, it was a men&#x27;s world championship match. While originally only for men, a women&#x27;s version of the Royal Rumble match was held as the main event at the 2018 event, which was also the first event to have two Rumble matches on one card. It subsequently became standard to have both a men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Royal Rumble match at the annual event. The 2025 event was the first to be held in a National Football League stadium, while the 2026 event will be the first to take place outside of North America as it will be held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which will be the first of WWE&#x27;s &quot;Big Five&quot; held in the country.

== History ==
=== Event ===
The Royal Rumble match was created by wrestler and WWE Hall of Famer Pat Patterson and the event was established by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). After the match was first tested at a house show in October 1987, the first Royal Rumble event took place on January 24, 1988, and was broadcast live as a television special on the USA Network. The following year, the event started to be broadcast on pay-per-view (PPV), and thus became one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; annual PPVs, along with WrestleMania, Survivor Series, and SummerSlam, the promotion&#x27;s then-four biggest shows of the year. From 1993 to 2002, it was considered one of the &quot;Big Five&quot;, including King of the Ring, but that PPV event was discontinued after 2002 (although it returned to PPV in 2024). In August 2021, Money in the Bank became recognized as one of the &quot;Big Five&quot;.

In May 2002, the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) following a lawsuit with the World Wildlife Fund over the &quot;WWF&quot; initialism. In April 2011, the promotion ceased using its full name with the &quot;WWE&quot; abbreviation becoming an orphaned initialism. Also in March 2002, the promotion introduced the brand extension, in which the roster was divided between the Raw and SmackDown brands where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform on their respective weekly television shows—ECW became a third brand in 2006. The first brand extension was dissolved in August 2011, but it was reintroduced in July 2016 (other brands, including NXT, NXT UK, and 205 Live, would also be active during this second brand split). The Royal Rumble, along with the other original &quot;Big Four&quot; events, were the only PPVs to never be held exclusively for one brand during either brand split periods. The 2008 Royal Rumble was the first WWE pay-per-view to be available in high-definition. In 2015, the Royal Rumble began to air on WWE&#x27;s online streaming service, the WWE Network, which launched in February 2014, and in 2022, the event became available on Peacock as the American version of the WWE Network merged under Peacock in March 2021.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that began affecting the industry in March 2020, WWE had to hold its events behind closed doors. The 2021 event was in turn held in WWE&#x27;s bio-secure bubble called the WWE ThunderDome, which at the time was hosted at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. WWE resumed live touring in July 2021 and the 2022 event was held at The Dome at America&#x27;s Center in St. Louis, Missouri.

From its inception in 1988 up through the 2024 event, the Royal Rumble was held annually in late January. On June 24, 2024, WWE announced a partnership with the Indiana Sports Corp which would see the 2025 Royal Rumble, as well as a future WrestleMania and a future SummerSlam, held at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana, marking the first Royal Rumble held in a National Football League stadium. The date for the 2025 Royal Rumble was announced for February 1, thus marking the first Royal Rumble held outside of January. This was also the first Royal Rumble, and WWE&#x27;s first PPV and livestreaming event, to air on Netflix following the international WWE Network&#x27;s merger under the platform in January 2025.

In early 2018, WWE began a 10-year strategic multiplatform partnership with the Ministry of Sport (formerly General Sports Authority) in support of Saudi Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s social and economic reform program. The first event in this partnership was the one-off Greatest Royal Rumble, which featured a 50-man Royal Rumble match. In May 2024, the chairman of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s General Entertainment Authority, Turki Alalshikh, announced that the country was in talks with WWE to bring either the Royal Rumble or WrestleMania to the country in 2026 or 2027. Ahead of &quot;Raw&quot;″s premier on Netflix on January 6, 2025, WWE officially confirmed that the 39th Royal Rumble would be happening in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia as part of Riyadh Season in January 2026, marking the first Royal Rumble to be held outside of North America, and the first of the &quot;Big Five&quot; held in Saudi Arabia. 

Due to the Royal Rumble matches taking up a large amount of time (most Rumble matches last roughly one hour), the Royal Rumble event tends to have a smaller card than most other pay-per-view events. The men&#x27;s Royal Rumble match is usually the main event, though there have been exceptions, namely the 1988, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2006, 2013, 2018, and 2023 events. In these cases, 1988&#x27;s main event was a tag team match, while the others were men&#x27;s world championship matches, except in 2018. The 2018 Royal Rumble was the first to include a women&#x27;s Royal Rumble match, which was the main event for that year. It was subsequently the first in which two Rumble matches were contested on one card and it is now standard for the event to include both a men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Rumble match.

=== Match ===

The Royal Rumble match is based on the classic battle royal, in which a number of wrestlers (traditionally 30) aim at eliminating their competitors by tossing them over the top rope, with both feet touching the floor. The difference between a Royal Rumble and a standard battle royal is that in a standard battle royal, all participants start the match in the ring at the same time, where in a Royal Rumble match, two participants start and then the rest enter at timed intervals. The winner of the match is the last wrestler remaining after all others have been eliminated. Since the 1993 event, the prize for winning is a world championship match at WrestleMania, with the exception of the 2016 event, where the prize was the WWE Championship (at the time known as the WWE World Heavyweight Championship) as reigning champion Roman Reigns defended the title in the match. According to Hornswoggle, who worked for WWE from 2006 until 2016 and participated in two Rumbles, participants may learn their eliminations by knowing the two wrestlers who are eliminated before them and which wrestlers are entering the Royal Rumble before and after their elimination.

<doc id="518918" wikidata="Q7874015" url="?curid=518918" title="USS Semmes (DDG-18)">
<text>USS &quot;Semmes&quot; (DDG-18), was the second Navy ship named for Commander (USN), Rear Admiral (CSN), Brigadier General (CSA) Raphael Semmes (1809–1877). &quot;Semmes&quot; was a guided-missile destroyer of the United States Navy. Entering service in 1962, &quot;Semmes&quot; spent most of her career in the Atlantic and Mediterranean theaters. Decommissioned in 1991, &quot;Semmes&quot; was transferred to the Hellenic Navy and renamed Kimon. The destroyer was decommissioned for the final time in 2004 and sold for scrap in 2006.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Semmes&quot; was laid down by Avondale Marine Ways, Inc. at Avondale, Louisiana on 15 August 1960 and launched on 20 May 1961 by Mrs. Felix Edward Hébert. &quot;Semmes&quot; was commissioned on 10 December 1962.

Following shakedown, &quot;Semmes&quot; joined Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 62, Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 6, at Charleston, South Carolina, in July 1963; and, into the summer of 1964, participated in various fleet exercises in the Atlantic and Caribbean. After September 7, 1964 she sailed east for a six-week NATO exercise, &quot;Masterstroke/Teamwork,&quot; in the North Atlantic-Norwegian Sea area; and, on 22 September, she crossed the Arctic Circle. Two months later, on 28 November, she deployed to the Mediterranean for her first tour, of four months, with the 6th Fleet. She returned to Charleston in time to participate in the 2nd Fleet&#x27;s exercises during the spring of 1965. She then took part in support operations off the Dominican Republic.

From February to July 1966, the guided missile destroyer conducted her second tour with the 6th Fleet; and, on her return to the United States, changed her home port from Charleston to Norfolk, Virginia, effective 1 August, in anticipation of her first major overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. In April 1967, &quot;Semmes&quot; resumed operations with refresher training in the Caribbean. In July, she rejoined DesRon 6 at Charleston; and, in August, she deployed for her third tour with the 6th Fleet. She participated in fleet and NATO exercises into January 1968; then returned to Charleston, arriving on 31 January for a month&#x27;s rest before resuming operations in the Caribbean and off the east coast.

On 10 June, &quot;Semmes&quot; again sailed east. During that month and into July, she visited Germany and Denmark; then turned south for another 6th Fleet deployment. On 15 November, she was relieved by the destroyer at Rota, Spain; and, 11 days later, she returned to Charleston where she remained in port for the rest of the year.

In January 1969, she cleared Charleston to participate in ASW and &quot;Springboard&quot; exercises in the Puerto Rican operating area; then returned to her homeport. In April, she returned to the Caribbean for 2d Fleet exercises.

===1970s===
Through the summer, &quot;Semmes&quot; continued to conduct exercises in the Caribbean and off the southeastern seaboard. In late September, she again crossed the Atlantic for a seven-month deployment with the 6th Fleet; and, on 10 February 1970, while moored at Naples, she was struck by the Greek freighter, SS &quot;Mautric&quot;. The damage sustained to her bow was quickly repaired; and, before the end of the month, she had resumed operations. By mid-March, she had arrived at Barcelona for turnover with . On 18 March she departed the Mediterranean; and, on 28 March, she returned to Charleston.

During 1971, her schedule remained basically the same; but her annual tour with the 6th Fleet, 16 July to 11 October, was followed by visits to the Netherlands and to Denmark for bi-national and NATO operations. On 20 December, &quot;Semmes&quot; returned to South Carolina; and, in January 1972, she entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard for conversion of her engineering plant to the Navy Distillate Fuel Oil System. With the spring, she resumed operations off the east coast and in the Caribbean. In September, she participated in NATO exercise &quot;Strong Express,&quot; which again took her above the Arctic Circle and which was followed by visits to Norway and Denmark. In October, she returned to Charleston. In November, she conducted exercises in the Caribbean; and, in December, she prepared for another deployment in the Mediterranean with NATO&#x27;s Standing Naval Force, Atlantic.

After sea trials in the Charleston operating area, &quot;Semmes&quot; got underway from that port on 4 January 1973. She arrived in Portsmouth, England, on 15 January, joining the NATO naval force there. For the next seven months, the guided missile destroyer cruised the Atlantic visiting ports on both sides of that ocean and participating in three exercises: NATO Exercise &quot;Sunny Seas&quot;, in January and February; Canadian Exercise MARCOT 2/73, in April and May; and Norwegian Exercise &quot;Midnight Sun&quot; in June. On 1 July, &quot;Semmes&quot; changed operational control back to the 2d Fleet and, nine days later, returned to Charleston.

Following a month of post-deployment standdown, from 10 July until 10 August, she resumed operations along the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean. In November and December, she took part in Exercises &quot;Fun in the Sun&quot; and LANTREADEX 2–74. &quot;Semmes&quot; reentered Charleston on 19 December to prepare for overhaul.

=== Greek service ===

&quot;Semmes&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 14 April 1991, sold to Greece on 13 September 1991 and renamed &quot;Kimon&quot;. She was decommissioned on 17 June 2004, placed in reserve at Souda Bay, Crete until scrapped fall 2006.

<text>USS &quot;Conyngham&quot; (DDG-17), the third ship named for Captain Gustavus Conyngham USN (1744–1819), was a &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class guided missile armed destroyer in the United States Navy.

&quot;Conyngham&quot; was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden in New Jersey on 1 May 1961, launched on 19 May 1962 by Mrs. Carl B. Albert, wife of Representative Albert of Oklahoma, House Majority Leader and commissioned on 13 June 1963.

== History ==

&quot;Conyngham&quot; was one of a few warships with shamrocks on her stacks (, and others for example). During her 27 years of commissioned service, &quot;Conyngham&quot; lived up to her motto, &quot;Ready to Serve&quot;. Her presence exerted a powerful influence during times of crisis and helped maintain peace as a component of NATO seapower throughout the Cold War period. &quot;Conyngham&quot; made 15 Mediterranean deployments—three to the Persian Gulf, seven to Northern Europe, and 11 deployments to the Caribbean. She distinguished herself during crises in Cyprus (1964, 1974); provided air cover for planes evacuating Americans from an insurrection in Amman, Jordan (1970); took part in contingency operations during the Arab-Israeli Yom-Kippur War (1973); was the escort combatant during the evacuation of Americans from Beirut, Lebanon (1976); and conducted Black Sea Freedom of Navigation operations (1979).

During the 1980s, &quot;Conyngham&quot; continued to support United States foreign policy when she served off the coast of Libya (1982); was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for providing naval gunfire support of Marines stationed in, and off the coast of, Beirut, Lebanon (1983) and monitored maritime traffic off the coast of Nicaragua (1983). She sailed with the Battle Group in support of U. S. intervention forces in Grenada (1983). While deployed to the Caribbean in 1986, &quot;Conyngham&quot; was credited with four drug interdictions and was awarded the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation Medal.

&quot;Conyngham&quot; continued superior performance as she escorted U. S. Flagged merchant shipping through the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War in 1987 in Operation Earnest Will. During that deployment she sortied from Bahrain on short notice and provided assistance to after she was hit by two anti-ship missiles launched by an Iraqi F-1 Mirage. &quot;Conyngham&quot; was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for her efforts in assisting the crippled ship. In 1988, &quot;Conyngham&quot; continue the &quot;Gus Can Do&quot; tradition during her deployments to the Fjords of Norway and Northern Europe.

A 16-year-old girl from Cork, Ireland stowed away aboard &quot;Conyngham&quot; in July 1988 during the 10-day return voyage to Norfolk. Eight sailors were found guilty of assisting her with the highest sentence being 70 days in the brig for hiding an illegal alien and aiding entry to the United States. She was returned to Ireland at which point she reported she was held against her will, drugged and sexually abused while on board. No charges were filed with regard to claims of drugs and sexual abuse.

&quot;Conyngham&quot; completed her fifteenth Mediterranean deployment and received her fourth Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; in 1989 while part of the battlegroup.

=== Mainspace fire ===
&quot;Conyngham&quot; suffered a severe fire on 8 May 1990, while conducting pre-deployment operations off the Virginia coast. A major fuel oil fire erupted from the ship&#x27;s Forward Fire Room into the ship&#x27;s superstructure, isolating the crew forward and aft, requiring an all-hands effort to extinguish it. The ship had just completed a maintenance availability and a fuel oil strainer had not been assembled properly by a contractor and not inspected to verify assembly by ships company. The result was that the assembly failed catastrophically and started a fuel oil fire, caused an officer to die, 18 other sailors to be injured and the ship to be decommissioned shortly thereafter. and rendered assistance during the incident.

=== Decommissioning ===
&quot;Conyngham&quot; was decommissioned on 20 October 1990, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 May 1991 and sold for scrap on 15 April 1994. &quot;Conyngham&quot; was &quot;broken up&quot; in the Cape Fear River near Wilmington, North Carolina in 1995.

<text>Edward Bradford Titchener (11 January 1867 – 3 August 1927) was an English psychologist who studied under Wilhelm Wundt for several years. Titchener is best known for creating his version of psychology that described the structure of the mind: structuralism. After becoming a professor at Cornell University, he created the largest doctoral program at that time in the United States. His first graduate student, Margaret Floy Washburn, became the first woman to be granted a PhD in psychology (1894).

== Biography ==

=== Education and early life ===
Titchener&#x27;s parents, Alice Field Habin and John Titchener, eloped to marry in 1869 and his mother was disowned by her prominent Sussex family. His father held a series of posts as a clerk or in accountancy before dying of tuberculosis in 1879. The family, of five surviving children (4 girls, 1 boy), moved at least 10 times during this time. When he was 9, Titchener was sent to live with his paternal grandparents and two aunts. His namesake grandfather was a successful solicitor and investor and also an ex-mayor of Chichester. He ensured that Titchener was first privately tutored and then given a grammar school education. However, his investments collapsed in 1881 and he died a few months later. In the reduced financial circumstances, Titchener&#x27;s subsequent education was funded by scholarships, paid employment and entrepreneurial activities.

Titchener attended The Prebendal School and Malvern College and then went on to Oxford (Brasenose College) from 1885 to 1890. He graduated with a rare &#x27;double first&#x27; BA degree in classics in 1889. His interests began to change to biology. At Oxford, Titchener first began to read the works of Wilhelm Wundt. During his time at Oxford, Titchener translated the first volume of the third edition of Wundt&#x27;s book &quot;Principles of Physiological Psychology&quot; from German into English. He spent an extra year at Oxford in 1890, working with John Scott Burdon-Sanderson, a physiologist to learn scientific methodology. Titchener went on to Leipzig in Germany to study with Wundt in autumn 1890. He completed his doctoral program in 1892 with a dissertation on binocular vision. In summer 1892 he returned to Oxford and Burdon-Sanderson where he taught in the Oxford Summer School.

In autumn 1892 Titchener joined the Sage School of Philosophy at Cornell University as an untenured lecturer teaching philosophy and psychology. He developed a psychology laboratory, gained editing positions and in 1895 gained tenure, a full professorship and independence from the Sage School. He taught his views on the ideas of Wundt to his students in the form of structuralism.

==Personal life==
Titchener was married in 1894 to Sophie Bedloe Kellogg, a public school teacher from Maine. They had four children (3 girls, 1 boy). Once Titchener had a position at Cornell he gave financial support to his mother for the rest of his life. She, and his sisters, had lived in difficult circumstances after the death of his father, with his sisters spending time in an orphanage and then entering domestic service.

== Main ideas ==

Titchener&#x27;s ideas on how the mind worked were heavily influenced by Wundt&#x27;s theory of voluntarism and his ideas of Association and Apperception (the passive and active combinations of elements of consciousness respectively). Titchener attempted to classify the structures of the mind in the way a chemist breaks down chemicals into their component parts—water into hydrogen and oxygen, for example. Thus, for Titchener, just as hydrogen and oxygen were structures, so were sensations and thoughts. He conceived of hydrogen and oxygen as structures of a chemical compound, and sensations and thoughts as structures of the mind. A sensation, according to Titchener, had four distinct properties: intensity, quality, duration, and extent. Each of these related to some corresponding quality of stimulus, although some stimuli were insufficient to provoke their relevant aspect of sensation. He further differentiated particular types of sensations: auditory sensation, for example, he divided into &quot;tones&quot; and &quot;noises.&quot; Ideas and perceptions he considered to be formed from sensations; &quot;ideational type&quot; was related to the type of sensation on which an idea was based, e.g., sound or vision, a spoken conversation or words on a page.

Titchener believed that if the basic components of the mind could be defined and categorised that the structure of mental processes and higher thinking could be determined. What each element of the mind is, how those elements interact with each other and why they interact in the ways that they do was the basis of reasoning that Titchener used in trying to find structure to the mind.

=== Introspection ===

The main tool that Titchener used to try to determine the different components of consciousness was introspection. Unlike Wundt&#x27;s method of introspection, Titchener had very strict guidelines for the reporting of an introspective analysis. The subject would be presented with an object, such as a pencil. The subject would then report the characteristics of that pencil (color, length, etc.). The subject would be instructed not to report the name of the object (pencil) because that did not describe the raw data of what the subject was experiencing. Titchener referred to this as stimulus error.

In &quot;Experimental Psychology: A Manual of Laboratory Practice&quot;, Titchener detailed the procedures of his introspective methods precisely. As the title suggests, the manual was meant to encompass all of experimental psychology despite its focus on introspection. To Titchener, there could be no valid psychological experiments outside of introspection, and he opened the section &quot;Directions to Students&quot; with the following definition: &quot;A psychological experiment consists of an introspection or a series of introspections made under standard conditions.&quot;

This manual of Titchener&#x27;s provided students with in-depth outlines of procedure for experiments on optical illusions, Weber&#x27;s Law, visual contrast, after-images, auditory and olfactory sensations, perception of space, ideas, and associations between ideas, as well as descriptions proper behaviour during experiments and general discussion of psychological concepts. Titchener wrote another instructive manual for students and two more for instructors in the field (Hothersall 2004, p. 142). The level of detail Titchener put into these manuals reflected his devotion to a scientific approach to psychology. He argued that all measurements were simply agreed-upon &quot;conventions&quot; and subscribed to the belief that psychological phenomena, too, could be systematically measured and studied. Titchener put great stock in the systematic work of Gustav Fechner, whose psychophysics advanced the notion that it was indeed possible to measure mental phenomena (Titchener 1902, p. cviii- cix).

The majority of experiments were to be performed by two trained researchers working together, one functioning as the &quot;observer&quot; (&quot;O&quot;) and the other as the &quot;experimenter&quot; (&quot;E&quot;). The experimenter would set up the experiment and record the introspection made by his partner. After the first run of any experiment, the researchers were to then switch roles and repeat the experiment. Titchener placed a great deal of emphasis on the importance of harmony and communication between the two memberships in these partnerships. Communication, in particular, was necessary, because illness or agitation on the part of the observer could affect the outcome of any given experiment.

The structuralist method gradually faded away due to the advent of newer approaches such as the introspective approach.

=== Attention ===

Edward B. Titchener formulated his seven fundamental laws of attention. Law number four, the law of prior entry, postulated that “the object of attention comes to consciousness more quickly than the objects which we are not attending to.” (Titchener, 1908, p. 251) The law of prior entry has received a lot of interest over the last century and much debate ensued about the veracity of this law. It is not until recently that research has generated robust evidence that attention operates at a perceptual level. Behavioral studies looking at the speed of perception of attended stimuli suggest that the law of prior entry holds true. Recent brain imaging studies have been able to confirm these findings by showing that attention can speed up perceptual brain activation.

== Life and legacy ==

Titchener was a charismatic and forceful speaker. However, although his idea of structuralism thrived while he was alive and championing for it, structuralism did not live on after his death. Some modern reflections on Titchener consider the narrow scope of his psychology and the strict, limited methodology he deemed acceptable as a prominent explanation for the fall of Titchener&#x27;s structuralism after his death. So much of it was wrapped up in Titchener&#x27;s precise, careful dictations that without him, the field floundered. Structuralism, along with Wundt&#x27;s voluntarism, were both effectively challenged and improved upon, though they did influence many schools of psychology today.

Titchener was known for bringing some part of Wundt&#x27;s structuralism to America, but with a few modifications. For example, whereas Wilhelm Wundt emphasised the relationship between elements of consciousness, Titchener focused on identifying the basic elements themselves. In his textbook &quot;An Outline of Psychology &quot; (1896), Titchener put forward a list of more than 44,000 elemental qualities of conscious experience.

Titchener is also remembered for coining the English word &quot;empathy&quot; in 1909 as a translation of the German word &quot;Einfühlungsvermögen&quot;, a new phenomenon explored at the end of 19th century mainly by Theodor Lipps. &quot;Einfühlungsvermögen&quot; was later re-translated as &quot;Empathie&quot;, and is still in use that way in German. It should be stressed that Titchener used the term &quot;empathy&quot; in a personal way, strictly intertwined with his methodological use of introspection, and to refer to at least three differentiable phenomena.

Titchener&#x27;s effect on the history of psychology, as it is taught in classrooms, was partially the work of his student Edwin Boring. Boring&#x27;s experimental work was largely unremarkable, but his book &quot;History of Experimental Psychology&quot; was widely influential, as, consequentially, were his portrayals of various psychologists, including his own mentor Edward Titchener. The length at which Boring detailed Titchener&#x27;s contributions—contemporary Hugo Münsterberg received roughly a tenth as much of Boring&#x27;s attention—raise questions today as to whether or not the influence credited to Titchener on the history of psychology is inflated as a result. Boring recorded that Titchener had supervised 56 doctoral students, including 21 women. Two others did not formally graduate due to personal circumstances.

Another student who brought attention to Titchener&#x27;s laboratory was Cheves West Perky (1874–1940), an American psychologist who performed the &quot;Banana Experiment&quot; in 1910, which led to the discovery of the Perky Effect, which examines the link between mental imagery and visual perception. Perky&#x27;s work has since &quot;achieved something of a classic, even mythic, status in the literature on imagery.&quot;

Professor Titchener received honorary degrees from Harvard, Clark, and Wisconsin. He became a charter member of the American Psychological Association, translated Külpe&#x27;s Outlines of Psychology and other works, became the American editor of &quot;Mind&quot; in 1894, and associate editor of the &quot;American Journal of Psychology&quot; in 1895, and wrote several books. In 1904, he founded the group &quot;The Experimentalists,&quot; which continues today as the &quot;Society of Experimental Psychologists&quot;. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1906. Titchener&#x27;s brain was contributed to the Wilder Brain Collection at Cornell University.

<text>Secret Window is a 2004 American psychological horror thriller film starring Johnny Depp and John Turturro. It was written and directed by David Koepp, based on the novella &quot;Secret Window, Secret Garden&quot; by Stephen King, featuring a musical score by Philip Glass and Geoff Zanelli. The story appeared in King&#x27;s 1990 collection &quot;Four Past Midnight&quot;. The film was released on March 12, 2004, by Columbia Pictures; it was a moderate box office success and received mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot==
After catching his wife Amy having an affair with their friend Ted, mystery writer Mort Rainey retreats to his cabin at Tashmore Lake in upstate New York, while Amy stays in their marital home. Six months later, Mort, depressed and suffering from writer&#x27;s block, has delayed finalizing the divorce.

One day, a man named John Shooter arrives at the cabin and accuses Mort of plagiarizing his short story, &quot;Sowing Season&quot;. Upon reading Shooter&#x27;s manuscript, Mort discovers it is virtually identical to his own story, &quot;Secret Window&quot;, except for the ending. The following day, Mort, who once plagiarized another author&#x27;s story, tells Shooter that his story was published in a mystery magazine two years before Shooter&#x27;s, invalidating his plagiarism claim. Shooter demands proof and warns Mort against contacting the police. That night, Mort&#x27;s dog, Chico, is found dead outside the cabin, along with a note from Shooter giving Mort three days to provide proof.

Mort reports the incident to Sheriff Newsome. Mort drives to his and Amy&#x27;s house intending to retrieve a copy of the magazine, but he leaves because Ted and Amy are there. Mort instead hires private investigator Ken Karsch, who stakes out the cabin and speaks to Tom Greenleaf, a local resident who thinks he saw Shooter and Mort talking together. At the cabin, Shooter appears and demands that Mort revise the ending of his story, giving it Shooter&#x27;s twist, in which the protagonist kills his wife. When an arson fire destroys Amy and Mort&#x27;s house, and presumably the magazine, Mort reveals to the police that he has an enemy.

Karsch tells Mort that he suspects someone has threatened Greenleaf after Greenleaf suddenly claims he never saw Mort and Shooter talking together. Mort and Karsch agree to confront Shooter but first plan to meet up with Greenleaf at the local diner the next morning. Arriving late, Mort discovers that neither Karsch nor Greenleaf showed up at the diner. On his way home, Mort encounters Ted at a gas station, where Ted demands that Mort sign the divorce papers. Believing Shooter is in Ted&#x27;s employ, Mort refuses, taunts Ted, and leaves.

Later, Shooter summons Mort to a meeting place; when he arrives, Mort finds Karsch and Greenleaf dead inside Greenleaf&#x27;s truck and passes out at the sight. When he recovers Shooter tells Mort he killed the two men because they had &quot;interfered&quot; in his business. He warns Mort that he has deliberately implicated him in the two men&#x27;s murders (having used Mort&#x27;s axe and screwdriver as the murder weapons) and implies Mort should dispose of the bodies. Mort agrees to meet Shooter at his cabin to show him the magazine containing his story, which is supposed to arrive that day, having been sent overnight by his literary agent. Mort later retrieves his tools and then pushes Greenleaf&#x27;s truck with both bodies still in it off a steep cliff into a water-filled quarry, where it sinks.

Mort retrieves the package containing the magazine from the post office but finds that it has already been opened; the pages containing his story have been cut out. At Mort&#x27;s cabin, Mort sees Shooter&#x27;s hat, puts it on, and begins speaking to himself, trying to make sense of the events. Frustrated and in denial, Mort throws an object at the wall and is surprised to see a growing crack fracture the cabin in half. Looking in the mirror, he&#x27;s startled to see the back of his head reflected instead. Mort realizes that Shooter is a figment of his imagination, a character brought to life through Mort&#x27;s undetected dissociative identity disorder, unwittingly created to cope with his anger and carry out malevolent tasks that Mort cannot do – like killing Chico, Greenleaf, and Karsch, as well as burning down Amy&#x27;s home. That persona now takes full control of Mort.

Amy arrives at the cabin, finding it ransacked, and she sees the word &quot;SHOOTER&quot; carved repeatedly on the walls and furniture. Mort appears, wearing Shooter&#x27;s hat and speaking and acting like him. Amy realizes the name &quot;Shooter&quot; represents Mort&#x27;s desire to &quot;SHOOT HER&quot;. He chases Amy and stabs her in the leg. Ted, looking for Amy, arrives and is ambushed by Mort, who kills him with a shovel. Amy watches helplessly as Mort bludgeons Ted and then approaches her while reciting the ending of &quot;Sowing Season&quot;.

Months later, Mort has recovered from his writer&#x27;s block, and his passion for life has returned. He is feared and shunned in town because of the rumors about the missing people associated with him. Sheriff Newsome arrives and tells Mort that he is the prime suspect in the supposed murders and that the bodies will eventually be found. Newsome then says that Mort is no longer welcome in town. Mort passively dismisses the threat and tells Newsome that the ending to his new story is &quot;perfect&quot;. It is implied that Amy and Ted&#x27;s bodies are buried under the corn growing in Mort&#x27;s garden, allowing Mort to gradually eliminate any evidence of their murders. (In an alternative ending available on home media, their bodies are shown under the earth.)

==Cast==
*Johnny Depp as Morton &quot;Mort&quot; Rainey
*John Turturro as John Shooter
*Maria Bello as Amy Rainey
*Timothy Hutton as Ted &quot;Teddy&quot; Milner
*Len Cariou as Sheriff Dave Newsome
*Charles S. Dutton as Private Investigator Ken Karsch
*John Dunn Hill as Tom Greenleaf

==Production==
Part of &quot;Secret Window&quot; was filmed in the town of North Hatley, Quebec in the Eastern Townships approximately two hours south east of Montreal. Other filming locations included Lake Massawippi, Lake Sacacomie, Lake Gale and the village of Bromont, Quebec.

According to director David Koepp on the DVD commentary track, the footage of the ocean scene during Mort&#x27;s restless night on the couch was extra b-roll footage taken from &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;.

The film&#x27;s ending is different from the source novella. In the novella, Ted and Amy survive Mort&#x27;s attempt on their lives, and Mort dies. It is also revealed that through supernatural forces, the fictional John Shooter had manifested and come to life from Mort&#x27;s imagination, and really was the one to commit the murders and arson.

==Reception==
Roger Ebert awarded &quot;Secret Window&quot; three stars out of a possible four, stating that it &quot;could add up to a straight-faced thriller about things that go boo in the night, but Johnny Depp and director David Koepp ... have too much style to let that happen.&quot; He continues by noting that the &quot;story is more entertaining as it rolls along than it is when it gets to the finish line. But at least King uses his imagination right up to the end, and spares us the obligatory violent showdown that a lesser storyteller would have settled for.&quot; Ian Nathan from &quot;Empire&quot; only awarded the film 2 stars out of a possible 5, stating that &quot;The presence of the sublime Depp will be enough to get &quot;Secret Window&quot; noticed, but even his latest set of rattling eccentricities is not enough to energise this deadbeat parlour trick.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Secret Window&quot; has an approval rating of 45% based on 161 reviews, with an average rating of 5.50/10. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;Depp is quirkily entertaining, but the movie runs out of steam by the end.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has an aggregated score of 46 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;Mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The film was a modest box office success, succeeding at recouping its budget of $40 million with a worldwide gross of $92.9 million.

An alternate ending was included on the home media release, explicitly showing both Ted&#x27;s and Amy&#x27;s dead bodies underneath the corn patch in Mort&#x27;s garden. In the theatrical release, this is implied, but the bodies are not shown.

<text>Flying ointment is a hallucinogenic ointment said to have been used by witches in the practice of European witchcraft from at least as far back as the Early Modern period, when detailed recipes for such preparations were first recorded and when their usage spread to colonial North America.

==Name==
The ointment is known by a wide variety of names, including witches&#x27; flying ointment, green ointment, magic salve, or lycanthropic ointment. In German it was () or (). Latin names included ), , () or ().

== Composition ==


Poisonous ingredients listed in works on ethnobotany include: belladonna, henbane bell, jimson weed, black henbane, mandrake, hemlock, and/or wolfsbane, most of which contain atropine, hyoscyamine, and/or scopolamine. Scopolamine can cause psychotropic effects when absorbed transdermally. These tropane alkaloids are classified as deliriants in regards to their psychoactive effects.

Francis Bacon (attributed as &quot;Lord Verulam&quot;) listed the ingredients of the witches ointment as &quot;the fat of children digged out of their graves, of juices of smallage, wolfe-bane, and cinque foil, mingled with the meal of fine wheat.&quot;

==Extreme toxicity of active ingredients==

With the exception of &quot;Potentilla reptans&quot;, the plants most frequently recorded as ingredients in Early Modern recipes for flying ointments are extremely toxic and have caused numerous fatalities when eaten, whether by confusion with edible species or in cases of criminal poisoning or suicide.

The historian, occultist and theosophist of Meiningen, author of &quot;Geschichte des Neueren Occultismus&quot; in 1892 and &quot;Die Geheimwissenschaften, eine Kulturgeschichte der Esoterik&quot; in 1895, was one such casualty.

==Bodily flight versus flight in spirit==

It has been a subject of discussion between clergymen as to whether witches were able physically to fly to the Sabbath on their brooms with help of the ointment, or whether such &#x27;flight&#x27; was explicable in other ways: a delusion created by the Devil in the minds of the witches; the souls of the witches leaving their bodies to fly in spirit to the Sabbath; or a hallucinatory &#x27;trip&#x27; facilitated by the entheogenic effects of potent drugs absorbed through the skin. An early proponent of the last explanation was Renaissance scholar and scientist Giambattista della Porta, who not only interviewed users of the flying ointment, but witnessed its effects upon such users at first hand, comparing the deathlike trances he observed in his subjects with their subsequent accounts of the bacchanalian revelry they had &#x27;enjoyed&#x27;. (book II, chapter XXVI, &quot;Lamiarum vnguenta,&quot;)

==Body in coma and riding on beasts==

Dominican churchman Bartolommeo Spina of Pisa gives two accounts of the power of the flying ointment in his &quot;Tractatus de strigibus sive maleficis&quot; (&#x27;Treatise on witches or evildoers&#x27;) of 1525.
The first concerns an incident in the life of his acquaintance Augustus de Turre of Bergamo, a physician. While studying medicine in Pavia as a young man, Augustus returned late one night to his lodgings (without a key) to find no one awake to let him in. Climbing up to a balcony, he was able to enter through a window, and at once sought out the maidservant, who should have been awake to admit him. On checking her room, however, he found her lying unconscious – beyond rousing – on the floor. The following morning he tried to question her on the matter, but she would only reply that she had been &#x27;on a journey&#x27;.

Bartolommeo&#x27;s second account is more suggestive and points toward another element in the witches&#x27; &#x27;flights&#x27;. It concerns a certain notary of Lugano who, unable to find his wife one morning, searched for her all over their estate and finally discovered her lying deeply unconscious, naked and dirty with her vagina exposed, in a corner of the pigsty. The notary &#x27;immediately understood that she was a witch&#x27; (!) and at first wanted to kill her on the spot, but, thinking better of such rashness, waited until she recovered from her stupor, in order to question her. Terrified by his wrath, the poor woman fell to her knees and confessed that during the night she had &#x27;been on a journey&#x27;.

Light is cast on the tale of the notary&#x27;s wife by two accounts widely separated in time but revealing a persistent theme in European Witchcraft. The first is that of Regino of Prüm whose &quot;De synodalibus causis et disciplinis ecclesiasticis libri duo&quot; (circa 906 C.E.) speaks of women who &#x27;seduced...by demons...insist that they ride at night &quot;on certain beasts&quot; [italics not original] together with Diana, goddess of the pagans, and a great multitude of women; that they cover great distances in the silence of the deepest night...&#x27; (See also Canon Episcopi).

The second account dates from some 800 years later, coming from Norway in the early 18th century and is the testimony, at the age of thirteen, of one Siri Jørgensdatter. Siri claimed that when she was seven her grandmother had taken her to the witches&#x27; sabbath on the mountain meadow Blockula (&#x27;blue-hill&#x27;): her grandmother led her to a pigsty, where she smeared a sow with some ointment which she took from a horn, whereupon grandmother and granddaughter mounted the animal and, after a short ride through the air, arrived at a building on the Sabbath mountain.

== Alleged sexual element in application ==


Some sources have claimed that such an ointment would best be absorbed through mucous membranes, and that the traditional image of a female witch astride a broomstick implies the application of flying ointment to the vulva. The passage from the trial for witchcraft in Ireland of Hiberno-Norman noblewoman Alice Kyteler in 1324 quoted above is, while not explicit, certainly open to interpretations both drug-related and sexual. It is also a very early account of such practices, pre-dating by some centuries witch trials in the early modern period. The testimony of Dame Kyteler&#x27;s maidservant, Petronilla de Meath, while compromised by having been extracted under torture, contains references not only to her mistress&#x27;s abilities in the preparation of &#x27;magical&#x27; medicines, but also her sexual behaviour, including at least one instance of (alleged) intercourse with a demon.
According to the inquisition (&#x27;in which were five knights and numerous nobles&#x27;) set in motion by Richard de Ledrede, Bishop of Ossory, there was in the city of Kilkenny a band of heretical sorcerers, at the head of whom was Dame Alice Kyteler and against whom no fewer than seven charges relating to witchcraft were laid. The fifth charge is of particular interest in the context of the &#x27;greased staffe&#x27; mentioned above:
==Possible opiate component==
One possible key to how individuals dealt with the toxicity of the nightshades usually said to be part of flying ointments is through the supposed antidotal reaction some of the solanaceous alkaloids have with the alkaloids of &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; (opium poppy). This antagonism was claimed to exist by the movement of Eclectic medicine. For instance, King&#x27;s American Dispensatory states in the entry on belladonna: &quot;Belladonna and opium appear to exert antagonistic influences, especially as regards their action on the brain, the spinal cord, and heart; they have consequently been recommended and employed as antidotes to each other in cases of poisoning&quot; going on to make the extravagant claim that &quot;this matter is now positively and satisfactorily settled; hence in all cases of poisoning by belladonna the great remedy is morphine, and its use may be guided by the degree of pupillary contraction it occasions.&quot;

The synergy between belladonna and poppy alkaloids was made use of in the so-called &quot;twilight sleep&quot; that was provided for women during childbirth beginning in the Edwardian era. Twilight sleep was a mixture of scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, and morphine, a &quot;Papaver&quot; alkaloid, that was injected and which furnished a combination of painkilling and amnesia for a woman in labor. A version is still manufactured for use as the injectable compound &quot;Omnopon&quot;.

There is no definite indication of the proportions of solanaceous herbs vs. poppy used in flying ointments, and most historical recipes for flying ointment do not include poppy.
Furthermore, a reputable publication by the former UK Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries (now DEFRA) states specifically that, in cases of poisoning by &quot;Atropa belladonna&quot; – far from being antidotes – &#x27;Preparations containing morphine or opiates should be &quot;avoided&quot; as they have a synergic action with atropine&#x27;; an appropriate antidote being, by contrast, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine salicylate.

== Historical documents ==

The first mention of an unguent in relation to a popular belief of orgiastic flying occurs in Roland of Cremona&#x27;s theological summa, written in the 1230s. The use by witches of flying ointments was first described, according to known sources, by Johannes Hartlieb in 1456. 
It was also described by the Spanish theologian Alfonso Tostado (d. 1455) in &quot;Super Genesis Commentaria&quot; (printed in Venice, 1507), whose commentary tended to accredit the thesis of the reality of the Witches&#x27; Sabbath. In 1477 Antone Rose confessed that the devil gave her a stick 18 inches in length on which she would rub an ointment and with the words &quot;go, in the name of the Devil, go&quot; would fly to the &quot;synagogue&quot; (an alternative name for Sabbath in early witchcraft).

==In popular culture==
===Drama===
There is, in the work of the playwright Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla (1607–1648) of Toledo, an exchange concerning the flying ointment, the (following) passage occurring in the play
&quot;Lo que quería el Marqués de Villena&quot; (&#x27;What the Marquis of Villena Wanted&#x27;).

===Literature and film===
*In Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot;, Goody Cloyse, after meeting the Devil, says &quot;I was all anointed with the juice of smallage, and cinquefoil, and wolf&#x27;s bane&quot; to which the Devil replies &quot;[m]ingled with fine wheat and the fat of a new-born babe&quot;.
*In Mikhail Bulgakov&#x27;s &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;, Margarita, after agreeing to act as hostess at Dr Woland&#x27;s ball, uses the ointment to become a witch and fly to the estate where the event is being held.
*In Clayton Rawson&#x27;s &quot;Death from a Top Hat&quot;, two recipes by Johann Weyer, a 16th-century demonologist, are given in a footnote:

:1-Water hemlock, sweet flag, cinquefoil, bat&#x27;s blood, deadly nightshade and oil.
:2-Baby&#x27;s fat, juice of cowbane, aconite, cinquefoil, deadly nightshade and soot.

* In the movie serial &quot;Warlock&quot;, the villain kills an unbaptised boy to get this &quot;Flying Ointment&quot;.
*In Jodi Picoult&#x27;s &quot;Salem Falls&quot;, a group of four girls practicing witchcraft ingest a flying ointment made of belladonna.
* In the book &quot;Calling on Dragons&quot; (Book three of the Enchanted Forest Chronicles), the witch Morwen uses a flying potion on a straw basket and a broomstick, not on herself.
* In E. L. Konigsburg&#x27;s &quot;Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, Elizabeth&quot;, two characters try to make a flying ointment.
* In the 2015 horror film &quot;The Witch&quot;, a witch kills an infant child and makes flying ointment out of his corpse.
*In the 2016 movie, &quot;The Love Witch&quot;, the main character applies a flying ointment to her body.
* In the 2019 movie, &quot;Portrait of a Lady on Fire&quot;, the two main characters apply a flying ointment to their armpits.
* In the 2020 movie, &quot;Gretel &amp; Hansel&quot;, directed by Oz Perkins, the witch, caressing a precious jar filled with ointment, applies it to herself, and then initiates Gretel into witchcraft by inducing her to do the same.

===Music===
* The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band song &#x27;11 Moustachioed Daughters&#x27; – a track on the Album &quot;The Doughnut in Granny&#x27;s Greenhouse&quot; – is a darkly comic and surprisingly detailed evocation of the traditional Witches&#x27; Sabbath, featuring the flying-ointment-related lines :
* The Swedish symphonic metal band Therion has a song called Unguentum Sabbati (Ointment of the Sabbat) on the album &quot;Sitra Ahra&quot;.

<text>William Edward Dodd (October 21, 1869 – February 9, 1940) was an American historian, author and diplomat. A liberal Democrat, he served as the United States Ambassador to Germany from 1933 to 1937 during the Nazi era. Initially a holder of the slightly antisemitic notions of his times, he went to Germany with instructions from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to do what he could to protest Nazi treatment of Jews in Germany &quot;unofficially&quot;, while also attempting to follow official State Department instructions to maintain cordial official diplomatic relations. Convinced from firsthand observation that the Nazis were an increasing threat, he resigned over his inability to mobilize the Roosevelt administration, particularly the State Department, to counter the Nazis prior to the start of World War II.

==Early and family life and education==
&quot;Willie&quot; Dodd was born on October 21, 1869, on a farm near Clayton, Johnston County, North Carolina, the eldest of eight children born to farmer John Daniel Dodd (1848–1941) and his first wife, the former Evaline Creech (1848–1909). His paternal English or Scottish ancestors had lived in America since the 1740s when Daniel Dodd settled among the Highland Scots in the Cape Fear Valley. The family included four younger brothers: Rev. Walter Henley Dodd (1872–1950), Alonzo Lewis Dodd (1875–1952), John Ivan Dodd (1876–1971), and Eff David Dodd (1884–1966). Of his three sisters, only Martha &quot;Mattie&quot; (Martha Ella) Dodd (born 1878) survived long enough to marry.

After graduating from Clayton High School, Dodd attended Oak Ridge Military Academy to prepare for college. He was unable to secure an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy or at the University of North Carolina, and so taught at local schools until 1891, when he enrolled at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech). Dodd received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1895 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1897, by which time he had begun teaching undergraduates. On a colleague&#x27;s advice, Dodd traveled to Germany and earned his PhD at the University of Leipzig in 1900, based on a thesis (in German) concerning Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s 1796 return to politics following a three-year hiatus. Shortly after returning to the United States and resuming his teaching career, Dodd married Martha Johns at her family&#x27;s home in nearby Wake County, North Carolina on December 25, 1901. They had two children, a daughter, Martha (1908–1990), and a son, William E. Dodd Jr. (1905–1952)

==Academic career==
Dodd learned a class-conscious view of Southern history from his family, which taught him that slaveholders were responsible for the Civil War. His semi-literate and impoverished father supported his family only through the generosity of wealthier relatives, whom Dodd came to view as &quot;hard men, those traders and aristocratic masters of their dependents&quot;. 

Dodd taught history at Randolph–Macon College in Ashland, Hanover County, Virginia, from 1900 to 1908. His instruction there was at times controversial, because it included attacks on Southern aristocratic values and the &quot;Lost Cause&quot;. In 1902, Dodd wrote an article in &quot;The Nation&quot; in which he complained of pressure to flatter Southern elites and their view that slavery played no role in the onset of the Civil War. He criticized the Grand Camp of Confederate Veterans by name. Confederate societies called for his dismissal. Dodd explained that &quot;To suggest that the revolt from the union in 1860 was not justified, was not led by the most lofty minded statesmen, is to invite not only criticism but an enforced resignation.&quot; University administrators supported him and he attacked his accusers and detailed their distortions of Southern history. Recruited by the University of Chicago, Dodd began his 25-year career as Professor of American History there in 1908; he declined an offer from the University of California, Berkeley, the following year.

Dodd was the first (and for many years the only) college or university professor fully devoted to the history of the American South. He produced many scholarly works, both articles and books, and won excellent reviews as a teacher. Though much of his scholarship was later superseded, Dodd helped to model a new approach to regional history: sympathetic, judicious, and less partisan than the work of earlier generations. In a letter to President Theodore Roosevelt (whose maternal ancestors were from the South), Dodd described his approach: &quot;The purpose of my studying and writing history is to strike a balance somewhat between the North and the South, but not to offer any defense of any thing.&quot; Dodd&#x27;s most prominent works (other than relating to President Wilson as described below) included: &quot;The Life of Nathaniel Macon&quot; (1903), &quot;Jefferson Davis&quot; (1907), &quot;Statesmen of the Old South&quot; (1911), &quot;Expansion and Conflict&quot; (1915), &quot;The Cotton Kingdom: A Chronicle of the Old South&quot; (1919) and &quot;The Old South: Struggles for Democracy&quot; (1937).

A Democrat, Dodd became active in Chicago politics. In 1912 he wrote speeches for presidential candidate Woodrow Wilson, a Virginian and academic whose family had similarly experienced the devastating aftermath of the American Civil War. Dodd and Wilson became friends. Shortly after Wilson won the U.S. Presidential Election of 1912, Dodd bought a farm in the developing tourist and railroad community of Round Hill in Loudoun County, Virginia, about 50 miles from Washington, D.C. Dodd would visit President Wilson in the White House frequently, and authored a biography, &quot;Woodrow Wilson and his Work&quot;, that appeared in 1920. Dodd became an early opponent of the theory that German imperialism was solely responsible for World War I. He gave speeches on behalf of Wilson and U.S. participation in the League of Nations. In 1920 Dodd reviewed the League-related parts of the speech Ohio Governor James M. Cox gave when accepting the Democratic nomination for the presidency. Following Wilson&#x27;s death, Dodd lectured on his administration and its accomplishments, revised his 1920 biography, and co-edited (with key aide Ray Stannard Baker) the six volumes of &quot;The Public Papers of Woodrow Wilson&quot;. Dodd defended Wilson in both scholarly journals and the popular press. Through these efforts, he developed connections to a number of figures in the Democratic Party establishment, including Josephus Daniels, Daniel C. Roper, and Edward M. House.

Dodd long planned to write a multi-volume history of the American South. As he reached his sixties, he found the prospect of completing it increasingly unlikely given his academic responsibilities. In addition to his responsibilities at the University of Chicago and later American University, Dodd held several positions as an officer of the American Historical Association and became that organization&#x27;s president in 1934 (after his ambassadorial appointment described below). Moreover, the Southern Historical Association was founded in November 1934 and began to publish the &quot;Journal of Southern History&quot; soon thereafter. Dodd had previously received honorary doctorates from Emory University (1920), the University of Alabama (1923), and the University of Cincinnati (1929). In 1932, he declined an invitation to speak with the committee charged with selecting a president of the University of Virginia. In June 1934 some alumni touted Dodd as a possible successor to the president of the College of William and Mary. In 1935, Avery Odelle Craven edited a festschrift titled &quot;Essays in Honor of William E. Dodd By His Former Students at the University of Chicago&quot;, which included papers by Frank Lawrence Owsley and Maude Howlett Woodfin. Dodd was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1936.

== Appointment as Ambassador to Germany ==
The Roosevelt administration had difficulty filling the post of U.S. Ambassador to Germany. The volatile political situation in Germany presented diplomatic challenges, but most observers expected German politics would stabilize before too long. The ambassadorship, normally a patronage position rather than one filled by a State Department professional, was offered to others, including James M. Cox and Newton D. Baker, both of whom declined citing personal reasons. With the administration under pressure to act before the adjournment of Congress, Secretary of Commerce Daniel C. Roper, a longtime friend of Dodd and his family, suggested his name after Dodd himself had made it clear he was seeking a diplomatic post that would allow him sufficient free time to complete his multi-volume history.

President Roosevelt offered Dodd the position on June 8, 1933, and sent the Senate his nomination two days later. He was confirmed the same day. Before his departure, Dodd&#x27;s old friend Carl Sandburg told him he needed &quot;to find out what this man Hitler is made of, what makes his brain go round, what his blood and bones are made of&quot; and still &quot;be brave and truthful, keep your poetry and integrity.&quot; Dodd left for Germany on July 5, 1933, accompanied by his wife and two adult children. His departure statements said:

==Service in Berlin==
===German debts===
Before his departure for Berlin, State Department officials set as his priority the need to ensure that the German government did not default on its debts to American lenders. Dodd met with a group of bankers in New York City who recognized that economic conditions in Germany made full payment unlikely. They hoped he could argue against a German default and suggested they would agree to lower the interest on their loans from 7% to 4% to prevent it. National City Bank and Chase National Bank held over 100 million dollars in German bonds, which Germany later proposed to pay back at the rate of thirty cents on the dollar. Dodd was not sympathetic to the bankers or the high interest rates they charged.

Still, he repeatedly registered protests with the German government when payments were suspended or debts to United States lenders were treated differently from debts owed to those in other countries. Yet he remained fundamentally in sympathy with Germany&#x27;s request that interest rates be lowered. As Secretary of State Hull insisted that Dodd renew his requests for payment, Dodd expressed frustration in his diary: &quot;What more can I say than I have said a score of times? Germany is in a terrible plight and for once she recognizes war is no remedy.&quot;

===Antisemitism===
Before leaving to take up his post, Dodd consulted on the situation in Germany, and especially Nazi persecution of the Jews, with his own contacts and during interviews the State Department arranged for him. The opinions he heard covered a broad range. Charles Richard Crane, a plumbing industry tycoon and philanthropist, expressed great admiration for Hitler. As for the Jews, Crane said: &quot;Let Hitler have his way.&quot; Some of the State Department&#x27;s most senior officials harbored an outright dislike of Jews, including William Phillips, Undersecretary of State, the second-highest-ranking man in the department. Dodd met with members of the Jewish-American community, including Stephen S. Wise and Felix Warburg, who asked him to seek a reversal of the Nazis&#x27; repressive anti-Jewish policies. Dodd promised he would &quot;exert all possible personal influence against unjust treatment&quot; of German Jews, but not in his official capacity.

President Roosevelt advised him on June 16, 1933:
Edward M. House, a veteran in Democratic Party circles since the Wilson administration, told Dodd that he should do what he could &quot;to ameliorate Jewish sufferings&quot;, but cautioned that &quot;the Jews should not be allowed to dominate economic or intellectual life in Berlin as they have done for a long time.&quot; Dodd shared House&#x27;s views, and wrote in his diary that &quot;The Jews had held a great many more of the key positions in Germany than their numbers or talents entitled them to.&quot; Based on this view of the proper role of Jews in society, he advised Hitler in March 1934 that Jewish influence should be restrained in Germany as it was in the United States. &quot;I explained to him [Hitler]&quot;, wrote Dodd, &quot;that where a question of over-activity of Jews in university or official life made trouble, we had managed to redistribute the offices in such a way as to not give great offense.&quot; Hitler ignored Dodd&#x27;s advice and responded that &quot;if they [the Jews] continue their activity we shall make a complete end of them in this country.&quot;

Dodd tried without success to save the life of Helmut Hirsch, a German-American Jew who planned to bomb parts of the Nazi party rally grounds at Nuremberg.

===Anti-Americanism===
The German government&#x27;s treatment of United States citizens created a series of crises during Dodd&#x27;s tenure as ambassador. Edgar Ansel Mowrer, a reporter for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; and president of the Foreign Press Association in Berlin, published a book-length attack on the Nazis, &quot;Germany Puts the Clock Back&quot;, and continued his critical coverage until the government demanded his resignation as head of the Association. The U.S. State Department ignored the government&#x27;s demand that it arrange for his return to the U.S. When Mowrer&#x27;s employers arranged for him to leave and he sought to stay to cover the September 1933 Nuremberg rally, Dodd refused to support him, believing his reporting was so provocative that it made it difficult for other American journalists to work.

===Assessment of Nazi intentions===
On October 5, 1933, Dodd gave a speech in Berlin at the American Club describing the New Deal&#x27;s effect on the U.S. Constitutional system: &quot;It was not revolution as men are prone to say. It was a popular expansion of governmental powers beyond all constitutional grants, and nearly all men everywhere hope the President may succeed.&quot;

On October 12, 1933, Dodd gave a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Berlin, with Joseph Goebbels and Alfred Rosenberg in attendance, and used an elaborate analogy based on Roman history to criticize the Nazis as &quot;half-educated statesmen&quot; who adopted the &quot;arbitrary modes&quot; of an ancient tyrant. His views grew more critical and pessimistic with the Night of the Long Knives in June–July 1934, when the Nazis killed prominent political opponents including many dissenters within the Nazi movement. Dodd was one of the very few in the U.S. and European diplomatic community who reported that the Nazis were too strongly entrenched for any opposition to emerge. In May 1935 he reported to his State Department superiors that Hitler intended &quot;to annex part of the Corridor, part of Czechoslovakia, and all of Austria&quot;. A few months later he predicted a German-Italian alliance. Feeling ineffectual, Dodd offered to resign, but Roosevelt allowed him only a recuperative visit to the U.S. The President wrote to U.S. Ambassador to Italy Breckinridge Long in September 1935 that he and Dodd had been &quot;far more accurate in your pessimism for the past two years than any of my other friends in Europe&quot;. In a note to Assistant Secretary of State R. Walton Moore that same month, he wrote of Dodd: &quot;we most certainly do not want him to consider resigning. I need him in Berlin.&quot; Dodd reported to Secretary of State Hull in September 1936 that Hitler&#x27;s domestic economic policies, rearmament, and Rhineland initiatives had consolidated his support to the point that he could count on the support of the German people for a declaration of war &quot;in any measure he might undertake&quot;.

Following a U.S. vacation of several months in 1936, Dodd devoted the fall to testing German reaction to a personal meeting between Roosevelt and Hitler, an initiative the President proposed, or a world peace conference. After a series of rebuffs, Dodd produced a report for the State Department dated November 28, 1936, which Assistant Secretary Moore commended and forwarded to Roosevelt. He decried the tendency of Europeans to refuse to believe that Hitler meant to carry out the expansionist plans he had outlined in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. He described Hitler&#x27;s success in outmaneuvering France and Great Britain diplomatically and forging ties with Italy and Spain. Assessing the current situation, he wrote: &quot;there does not appear to be any vital force or combination of forces which will materially impede Germany in pursuit of her ambitions.&quot;

===Conflict with State Department===
Many in the State Department had reservations about Dodd&#x27;s suitability for the job. He was neither a political figure of the sort normally honored with such a prestigious appointment, nor a member of the social elite that formed the higher ranks of the Foreign Service. In Berlin some of his subordinates were embarrassed by his insistence on living modestly, walking unaccompanied in the street, and leaving formal receptions so early as to appear rude. Dodd considered his insistence on living on his $17,500 annual salary a point of pride and criticized the posh lifestyle of other embassy officials.

Early in his tenure as ambassador, Dodd decided to avoid attending the annual Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg rather than appear to endorse Hitler&#x27;s regime. In 1933, the State Department left the decision to him, and other ambassadors—including those of France and Great Britain—adopted a similar policy to Dodd&#x27;s. As the Nazi Party became indistinguishable from the government, however, the State Department preferred that Dodd attend and avoid giving offense to the German government. State Department pressure increased each year until Dodd determined to avoid attending in 1937 by arranging a visit to the United States at the time of the rally. His advice against sending a representative of the U.S. embassy to attend the September 1937 Nazi Party congress in Nuremberg was overridden by his State Department superiors, and the State Department allowed its overruling of Dodd&#x27;s position to become public. Hitler expressed his pleasure with the attendance of the U.S., Great Britain, and France for the first time, recognizing it as an &quot;innovation&quot; in policy.

==Later life==
In 1937, Dodd stepped down as ambassador in Berlin, and President Roosevelt appointed Hugh Wilson, a senior professional diplomat, to replace him. After leaving his State Department post, Dodd took a position at American University in Washington, D.C.; in addition he campaigned to warn against the dangers posed by Germany, Italy, and Japan, detailing the racial and religious persecution in Germany. He predicted German aggression against Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Dodd, who suffered for years from a severe throat condition exacerbated by the stress of his ambassadorship, traveled on a speaking tour of Canada and the US, establishing his reputation as a statesman who opposed the Nazis.

In 1938, Dodd wrote an assessment of Nazi ideology and the Third Reich&#x27;s plan for Europe. He stated:

A volume of his planned four-volume history of the South was published in 1938 as &quot;The Old South: Struggles for Democracy&quot;, covering the 17th century.

Dodd&#x27;s wife died in May 1938.

In December 1938, Dodd accidentally ran over a four-year-old African-American child in Hanover County, Virginia, and fled the scene. The child sustained severe injuries, but survived. Dodd was charged with leaving the scene of an accident, convicted, and fined $250 plus court costs. Dodd also paid more than $1000 for the child&#x27;s medical bills. He also lost his voting rights, which were later restored by Virginia&#x27;s governor.

==Death and legacy==
After a year&#x27;s illness, Dodd died of pneumonia on February 9, 1940, at his country home at Round Hill, Loudoun County, Virginia. He was buried beside his wife at that historic farm they called &quot;Stoneleigh&quot;, but in 1946 his children reburied their parents at historic Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C. 
Stoneleigh subsequently passed through several owners; some historic buildings remain since it became a golf club in 1992. In 1941, his children published the diary Dodd kept during 1933–1938, and the 1916–1920 years were later published as well. Dodd&#x27;s papers are held in several places, including the Library of Congress, the Southern Historical Collection of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, the libraries of Randolph-Macon College, Duke University, and the University of Chicago, as well as among other people&#x27;s papers held by the Library of Virginia and Virginia Historical Society.

During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, and named in his honor.

In April 1946, during the Nuremberg trials, Dodd&#x27;s diaries were used as evidence against Hjalmar Schacht, a liberal economist and banker, and a Nazi government official until the end of 1937. Schacht praised Dodd&#x27;s character but suggested his views in the 1930s were tainted by his less than fluent German. He testified that Dodd was his friend who invited him to emigrate to the United States. Schacht&#x27;s attorney described Dodd as &quot;one of the few accredited diplomats in Berlin who very obviously had no sympathy of any sort for the regime in power&quot;.

==Assessments==
Assessments of Dodd&#x27;s service in Berlin vary considerably, colored by what another ambassador might have accomplished. Hull in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; described Dodd as &quot;sincere though impulsive and inexperienced&quot;.

Max Lerner later commented:

Dodd felt himself a failure both during his ambassadorship and after, having set himself the impossible standard of &quot;changing the Third Reich by example and persuasion.&quot; Historian Gerhard Weinberg believes no other ambassador to Nazi Germany was more effective, &quot;even if some were more popular and others better informed.&quot; He reports the assessment of George S. Messersmith, the embassy&#x27;s consul general who worked closely with Dodd, who wrote that &quot;there were very few men who realized what was happening in Germany more thoroughly&quot; than Dodd, who proved ineffective because he &quot;was completely appalled by what was happening&quot;. Historian Franklin L. Ford faults Dodd for failing to provide &quot;concrete intelligence concerning &quot;immediate&quot; Nazi objectives and power&quot; as his peers were providing their superiors in London and Paris. He faults as well Dodd&#x27;s nostalgic view of the Germany of his student years and of centuries past, which led Dodd to view German anti-Semitism as a Nazi phenomenon driven personally by Hitler without recognizing its deeper roots in German society.

Dodd and his family&#x27;s time in Nazi Germany are the subject of Erik Larson&#x27;s bestselling 2011 work of popular history, &quot;In the Garden of Beasts&quot;, which portrays Dodd as well-meaning but naive and unprepared, believing as a historian that all national leaders are ultimately rational actors, and rendered helpless when he realizes that Hitler may in fact be completely irrational.

<text>The Puli (plural &quot;pulis&quot; or &quot;pulik&quot;) is a small-medium breed of Hungarian herding dog known for its long, corded coat. The tight curls of the coat appear similar to dreadlocks. A similar-looking, but much larger breed – also Hungarian – is the Komondor.

== Description ==

=== Appearance ===
The Puli is a solid-colored dog that is usually black. Other less common coat colors are white, gray, or cream (off-white or &quot;fakó&quot; in Hungarian). A variety of the cream-coated dogs have black masks. The white Pulis are not albino, nor do they have blue eyes. They commonly have dark pigment, black pads, black noses and black pigment inside the mouth. The white gene is recessive to the pure black gene. The breed standard for females is about at the withers and for males. Females weigh 23-25 pounds and males slightly more. The coat of some Puli dogs can be different with either thinner or thicker cords which can be flat or round depending on the texture of the coat and the balance of undercoat to outer coat.

The coat is the result of a controlled matting process. Thin, rope-like corded coats are desired and the grooming should control the coat towards the forming of thinner ropes. The Puli&#x27;s coat needs considerable grooming to keep its cords clean, neat, and attractive. With age, the coat can become quite long, even reaching the ground. Alternatively, the coat can be trimmed short regularly for easy maintenance although the corded coat is what attracts many people to the breed. Contrary to some beliefs, the coat of a healthy Puli will grow out again after trimming. This breed has little to no shedding.

=== Temperament ===
An intelligent and active dog, the Puli needs obedience training while still young. With enough exercise, Pulis can live in the city, but they do best when not kept as indoor pets in small living spaces as, without enough exercise to use up their energy, they can become either shy or overactive. They need to get the kind of exercise they were created for. Pulis are best kept in a house with a garden. Cozy and very friendly especially towards children, they are sensitive and prone to resentment.

===Activities===
Despite their bulky appearance and very thick coat, Pulis are very fast, agile, and able to change directions rapidly. They are obedient enough to train for athletic competition. Pulis are devoted and form close bonds with their owners.

Traditionally, the Puli dog breed was used as a herding dog and sometimes even as a livestock guarding dog, as well. They make very good guard dogs, since they are very protective of their masters and territory. The Puli is sensitive, fun-loving, courageous, but also, at times, tough and headstrong.

They are loyal to their owners and wary of strangers. They are highly active and keep a playful, puppy-like behavior their entire lives. They need a lot of exercise and free space, preferably outdoors. They can be trained and housebroken, but Pulis are generally not very well suited as city or indoor pets. When restricted to closed spaces for long periods of times, they grow restless and may develop unwanted personality traits, such as becoming hyperactive or, instead, increasingly aloof and lazy.

As a working dog, the Puli is focused and determined when assigned a task. Some of them are used as police dogs. As a livestock guarding dog, they are fiercely protective of their territory and flock, and, despite their relatively small size, will fearlessly try to scare and drive any intruder away; however, they very rarely inflict any real injuries.
Pulis can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Pulis exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.

=== Training ===
Pulis are valued for their energy and determination which is a result of their sheepdog history. Every Puli is a natural shepherd and instinctively knows how to herd a flock of sheep or livestock even if they have been raised as a family dog and have never been trained to do it. It is advisable to start training the Puli early in age, especially in obedience. They are very independent, strong-willed, and difficult to train in adulthood.

== History ==
The Magyars probably brought the Puli to Hungary in the 9th Century when they invaded westwards from Siberia, and it has been a sheepdog on the Hungarian plain since then. According to the Encyclopedia of the Dog, the puli is &quot;almost certainly&quot; the ancestor of the poodle. The breed was first studied by Dr Emil Raitsitz from Hungary&#x27;s veterinary college in the 1920s.

The Puli would commonly work together with the much larger, white Komondor, a Hungarian breed of (solely) livestock guardian dog. The Komondor is a large, solidly built dog, around 30 inches tall. The Komondor (or several Komondors if there was a large amount of livestock) guarded the sheep or cattle mostly at night, while the Puli herded and guarded them during the day.

When wolves or bears attacked the livestock, the Puli would alert the pack and the Komondors would come and fight the intruders. Pulis can be good at fighting off wolves, because the thick coat protects their skin from being bitten. The Komondors usually rested during daytime but at night walked around the flock, constantly moving, patrolling the area.

Nomadic shepherds of the Hungarian plains valued their herding dogs, paying as much as a year&#x27;s salary for a Puli.

Although the coats may look slightly similar, the Puli has never worked in water and the Puli&#x27;s coat does not grow continuously in the same fashion as a corded Poodle&#x27;s coat once the cords are formed.

Possibly the Puli&#x27;s ancestors are ancient Hungarian shepherd dogs. Travelers brought the Puli with them to the Carpathian basin, to help organize the flocks and herd the stallions of the area. Large Komondor or Kuvasz were used for guarding the flock. The Puli was also a suitable guard for flock protection but was primarily used for herding the animals. Around the beginning of the 20th century, a real turning point for the breed came when it was rediscovered but no longer used much as a sheepdog; extensive shepherding was replaced by intensive farming. The Puli&#x27;s role was reduced in the life of the flock. Although their traditional duty was kept, they started to fulfil jobs that were convenient in the circumstances of their owner: they became house dogs. After World War II, the breed became a less popular pet; even now, the breed has not been able to regain the popularity it previously enjoyed.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture imported four purebred Pulis in 1935 to Beltsville, Maryland as part of an experiment when trying to help American agriculturists concerned with the problem of herding dogs which sometimes killed the animals to which they had been entrusted to control. The Pulis were bred among themselves and crossed with the German Shepherd, the Chow Chow and perhaps with two Turkish sheepdogs which were quartered there at the time. On the tests given by researchers there, Pulis scored, on the average, between 75 and 85, where other herding breeds, scored in the range of 12 to 14. Because tests were inconclusive, they were never published. When WWII broke out, the Pulis were auctioned off to professional breeders, and, it is thought that, it is from these four dogs and their progeny that history of the Puli in the United States began.

==Notable Pulis==

In 1978, a Puli called Cinko Duda Csebi won the world exposition organized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. The Mexican-born dog was owned by breeder Roberto Hernández Ávalos.

The dog known as &quot;The Auditor&quot; is assumed to be a Puli. It lived in the contaminated Berkeley Pit copper mine in Butte, Montana. Notable for being one of the few things that could live and thrive in such a place, in time it became a sort of mascot for the town. After The Auditor died, several memorials were erected celebrating its existence.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has a white Puli named Beast.

In the 1960s, writer Harlan Ellison adopted a Puli named Ahbhu and wrote about him in the 1975 Hugo-winning novelette &quot;The Deathbird&quot; (part of the 1975 collection &quot;Deathbird Stories&quot;). In addition, Ahbhu appeared in the 1969 short story &quot;A Boy And His Dog&quot; as a predecessor to the main character&#x27;s telepathic dog Blood.

American novelist T. C. Boyle used to own several Pulis and still has one. One of them, named &quot;Kutya&quot; (Hungarian for &quot;dog&quot;), is commemorated in his novel &quot;The Harder They Come&quot;.

<text>Mari Boine (born Mari Brit Randi Boine; 8 November 1956) is a Norwegian Sámi singer. She combined a form of Sámi joik singing with rock. In 2008, she became a professor of musicology at Nesna University College.

==Biography==
Mari Boine was born and raised in Gámehisnjárga, a village on the river Anarjohka in Karasjok Municipality, Finnmark county, Norway.

Boine&#x27;s parents were Sámi who made their living from salmon fishing and farming. She grew up steeped in the natural environment of Sápmi, but also amidst the strict Laestadian Christian movement with discrimination against her people: for example, singing in the traditional Sami joik style was considered &quot;the devil&#x27;s work&quot;. The local school Boine attended reflected a very different world from her family&#x27;s. All the teaching was in Norwegian.

===Anti-racism===
As Boine grew up, she started to rebel against the prejudiced attitude of being an inferior &quot;Lappish&quot; woman in Norwegian society. For instance, the booklet accompanying the CD &quot;Leahkastin&quot; (Unfolding) is illustrated with photographs with racist captions like &quot;Lapps report for anthropological measurement&quot;, &quot;Typical female Lapp&quot;, &quot;A well-nourished Lapp&quot;; and it ends with a photo of Boine herself as a girl, captioned &quot;Mari, one of the rugged Lapp-girl types&quot; and attributed &quot;(Photo: Unidentified priest)&quot;.

When Boine&#x27;s album &quot;Gula Gula&quot;, originally released on her Iđut label in 1989, was rereleased on Peter Gabriel&#x27;s RealWorld label in July 1990, its front cover showed an iconic image of the tundra of the far north, the eye of a snowy owl. The front cover, unlike the 1989 version, did not show the name of the album, or the name or face of Mari Boine herself; the back cover printed the name &#x27;Mari Boine Persen&#x27;, the Persen surname identifying her as a Norwegian rather than a Sámi. On the 2007 release on her own Lean label, the album cover explicitly names Mari Boine with her Sámi surname, and shows her in traditional robes as a shamanistic dancer of her own people, while the white background, like the snowy owl of the original release, hints at the snows of the north.

Boine was asked to perform at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, but refused because she perceived the invitation as an attempt to bring a token minority to the ceremonies.

===Musical style===
Boine&#x27;s songs are strongly rooted in her experience of being in a despised minority. For example, the song &quot;Oppskrift for Herrefolk&quot; (&quot;Recipe for a Master Race&quot;) on her breakthrough CD &quot;Gula Gula&quot;, sung in Norwegian unlike the rest of the songs which are in Northern Sámi, speaks directly of &quot;discrimination and hate&quot;, and recommends ways of oppressing a minority: &quot;Use bible and booze and bayonet&quot;; &quot;Use articles of law against ancient rights&quot;.

Boine&#x27;s other songs are more positive, often singing of the beauty and wildness of Sápmi, the Sámi lands of northern Scandinavia. The title track of &quot;Gula Gula&quot; asks the listener to remember &quot;that the earth is our mother&quot;.

Boine sings in an adaptation of traditional Sámi style, using the &quot;joik&quot; voice, with a range of accompanying instruments and percussion from indigenous traditions from around the world. For example, on &quot;Gula Gula&quot; the instruments used include drum, guitar, electric bass clarinet, dozo n&#x27;koni, gangan, udu, darbuka, tambourine, seed rattles, cymbal, clarinet, piano, frame drum, saz, drone drum, hammered dulcimer, bouzouki, overtone flute, bells, bass, quena, charango and antara.

In 2017, she released &quot;See the Woman&quot;, her first English-language album.

==Reception==
Rootsworld, interviewing Boine in 2002, described her as &quot;an unofficial Sámi cultural ambassador&quot;.

&quot;The Guardian&quot;, in its 2010 F&amp;M playlist of songs &quot;they just can&#x27;t turn off&quot;, describes &quot;Mu Ustit, Eŋgeliid Sogalaš (My Friend of Angel Tribe)&quot; with the words &quot;Norwegian Sami singer Boine, with this soft, melancholy and utterly mesmerising song.&quot;

Johnny Loftus, reviewing Boine&#x27;s &quot;Eight Seasons/Gávcci Jahkejuogu&quot;, wrote that &quot;Boine seems to have been inspired, collaborating with producer Bugge Wesseltoft for a collection of pieces weaving her alternately supple and intimate, angry and otherworldly vocals into moody arrangements tinged with jazz influence and electronic programming.&quot; While there was a degree of cliché in that, wrote Loftus, it worked well, concluding: &quot;Boine&#x27;s voice, filtered at first behind the halting notes of a guitar, builds in strength over the brooding electronic rhythm, until her Joik overtakes the electronics completely, becoming fully responsible for the song&#x27;s deep, chilly atmosphere. Let&#x27;s see a keyboard&#x27;s hard drive do that.&quot;

==Awards==
In 1993, Boine became the first recipient of the Áillohaš Music Award, a Sámi music award conferred by Kautokeino Municipality and the Kautokeino Sámi Association to honor the significant contributions the recipient or recipients has made to the diverse world of Sámi music.

In 2003, Boine was awarded the Nordic Council Music Prize. She was appointed knight, first class in the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav for her artistic diversity on 18 September 2009. On 7 October 2012, Boine was appointed as a &quot;statsstipendiat&quot;, an artist with national funding, the highest honour that can be bestowed upon any artist in Norway.

Boine has received other awards as follows:

<doc id="518951" wikidata="Q536580" url="?curid=518951" title="Vatican Apostolic Archive">
<text>The Vatican Apostolic Archive (; ), formerly known as the Vatican Secret Archive, is the central repository in the Vatican City of all acts promulgated by the Holy See. 

The Pope, as the sovereign of Vatican City, owns the material held in the archive until his death or resignation, with ownership passing to his successor. The archive also contains state papers, correspondence, account books, and many other documents that the church has accumulated over the centuries. 

Pope Paul V separated the Secret Archive from the Vatican Library, where scholars had some very limited access, and the archive remained closed to outsiders until the late 19th century, when Pope Leo XIII opened the archive to researchers, more than a thousand of whom now examine some of its documents each year.

==“Secret” name==
The use of the word &quot;secret&quot; in the former title, &quot;Vatican Secret Archive&quot;, does not denote the modern meaning of confidentiality. A fuller and perhaps better translation of the archive&#x27;s former Latin name may be the &quot;private Vatican Apostolic archive&quot;, indicating that its holdings are the pope&#x27;s personal property, not those of any particular department of the Roman Curia or the Holy See. The word &quot;secret&quot; continues to be used in this older, original sense in the English language, in phrases such as &quot;secret servants&quot;, &quot;secret cupbearer&quot;, or &quot;secretary&quot;, much like an esteemed position of honour and regard comparable to a VIP. One study in 1969 stated that use of the term &quot;secret&quot; was merited, as the archives&#x27; cataloguing system was so inadequate that it remained &quot;an extensive buried city, a Herculaneum inundated by the lava of time ... secret as an archeological dig is secret&quot;.

Despite the change in name, parts of the archive do remain classified in the modern sense of the word &quot;secret&quot;; most of these classified materials, which are actively denied to outsiders, relate to contemporary personalities and activities, including everything dated after 1958, as well as the private records of church figures after 1922.

On 28 October 2019, Pope Francis issued an Apostolic Letter dated 22 October, renaming the archives from the Vatican Secret Archive to the Vatican Apostolic Archive.

== History ==

=== The early Church ===
In the 1st century of Christianity, the Church had already acquired, and begun to assemble, a sizable collection of records. Known alternately as the Holy Scrinium or the Chartarium, these records normally travelled with the current pope.

In later centuries, as the Church amassed power, popes would visit heads of state to negotiate treaties or make political appearances around Europe. Popes would also have multiple places of residency. When they travelled for diplomatic or other purposes, they would take their archives with them, since they needed it for administrative work. This resulted in some loss of items.

Initially, the archival materials of the Church were stored at the Lateran Palace, then the official papal residence.

=== Uprisings, revolts, and the Western Schism (10851415) ===
By the 11th century, the archives of the church were devolved to at least three separate sites: the Lateran, St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, and the Palatine palace. 

When the Popes moved to Avignon, the process of transporting their archives took twenty years, all told. The various places where the archives were kept along the way were sacked by the Ghibellines three separate times, in 1314, 1319, and 1320.

Antipopes also had their own archives. The Western Schism resulted in two sets of papal archives being developed at once; this rose to three during the era of Pisan antipope John XXIII. The disparate archives of the rival papal claimants were not fully reunited in the Vatican&#x27;s archives until 1784.

During the 1404 sack of the Vatican, papal registers and historical documents were thrown into the streets, and Pope Innocent VII fled the city. His successor, Pope Gregory XII, supposedly sold off a large number of archival materials in 1406, including some of the papal registers.

=== Founding the archive ===
In 1612, Pope Paul V ordered all Church records assembled in one place.

=== Seizure by the French government and restoration ===

As Napoleon Bonaparte conquered the states on the Italian peninsula in the 1790s, he demanded works of art and manuscripts as tribute. His armistice with Holy See on 23 June 1796 stipulated that &quot;the Pope shall deliver to the French Republic one hundred pictures, busts, vases or statues ... and five hundred manuscripts&quot;, all chosen by French agents. The 1798 Treaty of Tolentino made even greater demands, and the works sent to Paris included the , the oldest extant manuscript of the Bible in Greek.

By the time Napoleon became emperor in 1804, he envisaged a central archive in Paris of the records and treasures of Europe. In 1809 he ordered the entire Vatican Archive transferred to Paris, and by 1813 more than 3,000 crates had been shipped, with only modest losses. The Vatican archives were stored in the complex of the National Archives of France, on the grounds of the Hôtel de Soubise.

In April 1814, after Coalition troops entered Paris, the new French government ordered the archive returned, but provided inadequate financing. Vatican officials raised funds by selling some volumes as well as bundling documents for sale by weight. Inadequate funding led to losses en route, with one scholar of the period estimating that &quot;about one-fourth to one-third of the archival materials that went to Paris never returned to the Vatican.&quot;

== Access to scholars ==
===19th-century developments===
In 1855, Augustin Theiner, prefect of the Archive, began to publish multi-volume collections of documents from the archive. His predecessor Marino Marini had produced an account of Galileo&#x27;s trials that failed to satisfy scholars who saw it as an apology for the Inquisition. Beginning in 1867, Theiner and his successor granted individual scholars access to the manuscripts relating to the trial of Galileo, leading to a protracted dispute about their authenticity. Scholarly access was briefly interrupted following the dissolution of the Papal States in 1870, when archive officials restricted access to assert their control against competing claims by the victorious Italian state.

In 1879, Pope Leo XIII appointed as archivist Cardinal Josef Hergenröther, who immediately wrote a memo recommending that historians be allowed access to the archive. Access had remained limited out of concern that Protestant researchers might use their access to slander or embarrass the Church. Hergenröther&#x27;s approach led to Pope Leo ordering a reading room constructed for researchers; it opened on 1 January 1881. When the German Protestant historian Theodor von Sickel, in April 1883, published the results of his research in the archive, which defended the Church against charges of forgery, Pope Leo was further persuaded. In August 1883 he wrote to the three cardinals who shared responsibility for the archives and praised the potential of historical research to clarify the role of the papacy in European culture and Italian politics. He announced that the archives would be open to research that was impartial and critical. In an address to the Görres Society in February 1884, Pope Leo said: &quot;Go to the sources. That is why I have opened the archives to you. We are not afraid of people publishing documents out of them.&quot;

=== Access in the modern era ===
In 1979, historian Carlo Ginzburg sent a letter to the newly elected Pope John Paul II, asking that the archives of the Holy Office (the Roman Inquisition) be opened. Pope Benedict XVI said that letter was instrumental in the Vatican&#x27;s decision to open those archives.

Though the archive has developed policies that restrict access to material by pontificate, with access granted no earlier than 75 years after the close of a pope&#x27;s reign, popes have granted exceptions. For example, Pope Paul VI made the records of the Second Vatican Council available not long after it ended. In 2002, Pope John Paul II allowed scholars access to documents from the historical archives of the Secretariat of State (&quot;Second Section&quot;) pertaining to the Holy See&#x27;s relations with Germany during the pontificate of Pope Pius XI (1922–1939) in order &quot;to put an end to unjust and thoughtless speculation&quot; about the Church&#x27;s relationship with the Nazi Party.

Following the success of the controversial 2008 film &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;, adapted from the Dan Brown novel of the same name, which depicts a visit to the Archives, the Vatican opened the Archives to a select group of journalists in 2010 to dispute the film&#x27;s treatment.

In 2018, Pope Francis ordered the Vatican Archive to open documents which would assist in a &quot;thorough study&quot; concerning former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who was accused of sexually molesting seminarians and having affairs with young priests.

===Archives of Pope Pius XII (2020) ===
Pope Francis announced on 4 March 2019 that materials relating to Pope Pius XII would be opened on 2 March 2020, stating that Pius&#x27; legacy had been &quot;debated and even criticized (one might say with some prejudice or exaggeration)&quot;, that &quot;The Church is not afraid of history&quot;, and that he anticipated &quot;appropriate criticism&quot;. In addition to assessing Pius&#x27; response to the Holocaust, the archives of the papacy of Pope Pius XII should point to a much broader shift in global Christianity from Europe to the global South. Since 2006, members of the archives department have been organising the estimated 16 million pages of documents in order to prepare them for viewing by researchers.

==Holdings==
The Vatican Apostolic Archive has been estimated to contain of shelving, with 35,000 volumes in the selective catalogue alone.

Complete archives of letters written by the popes, known as the papal registers, are available beginning with the papacy of Pope Innocent III (r. 1198–1216). A few registers of earlier popes also survive, including Pope John VIII (r. 872–882) and Pope Gregory VII (r. 1073–1085).

Notable documents include Henry VIII of England&#x27;s request for a marriage annulment, a handwritten transcript of the trial of Galileo for heresy, and letters from Michelangelo complaining he had not been paid for work on the Sistine Chapel.

To mark the 400th anniversary of the Vatican Archives, 100 documents dating from the 8th to the 20th century were put on display from February to September 2012 in the &quot;Lux in arcana – The Vatican Secret Archives reveals itself&quot; exhibition held at the Capitoline Museums in Rome. They included the 1521 papal bull of excommunication of Martin Luther and a letter from Mary, Queen of Scots, written while awaiting her execution.

The archive also supports its own photographic and conservation studios.

==Access policy==

The entrance to the Archive, adjacent to the Vatican Library, is through the Porta di Santa Anna in via di Porta Angelica (Rione of Borgo). In 1980, following modern renovations, new underground storage space was added. 

* Distinguished and qualified scholars from institutions of higher education pursuing scientific research with an adequate knowledge of archival research may apply for an entry card. 
* Select scholars need an introductory letter from either a recognized institute of research or a suitably qualified person in their field of historical research. 
* Applicants need to provide their personal data (name, address, etc.), as well as the purpose of their research. 
* Only paper, pencil and computer laptops are permitted. No ink, pens, or any digital camera photography are allowed inside. 
* Only five requested articles can be taken at a time, and only sixty academicians per day are allowed inside.

With limited exceptions, materials dated after 1939 were unavailable to researchers until 2 March 2020, when material from the tenure of Pope Pius XII (1939—1958) was opened for public access. 

An entire section of the distinguished archives relating to the personal affairs of Cardinalship from 1922 onwards cannot be accessed.

==Digitization project==

Early in the 21st century, the Vatican Apostolic Archives began an in-house digitization project, to attempt to both make the documents more available to researchers and to help to preserve aging physical documents. 

, the archive had 180 terabytes of digital storage capacity, and had digitized over seven million images.
In 2017, a project based in Roma Tre University called began using artificial intelligence and optical character recognition to attempt to transcribe more documents from the archives. While character-recognition software is adept at reading typed text, the cramped and many-serifed style of medieval handwriting makes distinguishing individual characters difficult for the software. Many individual letters of the alphabet are often confused by human readers of medieval handwriting, let alone a computer program. The team behind tried to solve this problem by developing a machine-learning software that could parse this handwriting. Their program eventually achieved 96% accuracy in parsing this type of text.

==Other archives of the Holy See ==
There are other Holy See archives in Rome, since each department of the Roman Curia has its own archives. The word &quot;secret&quot; in its modern sense can be applied to some of the material kept by the Apostolic Penitentiary, when it concerns matters of the internal forum; but registers of the rescripts that it issued up to 1564 have been deposited in the Vatican Apostolic Archives and are open for consultation by qualified scholars. Half of these have already been put in digital form for easier consultation. The confidentiality of the material means that, in spite of the centuries that have passed since 1564, special rules apply to its publication.

Recognized as the first great slugger in baseball history, and among the greatest sluggers of his era, he briefly held the career home run record from to , with his final total of 106 tying for the fourth most of the 19th century. His career slugging percentage of .520 remained the Major League record until Babe Ruth overtook him in the 1920s. At the time of his initial retirement, he also ranked second in career triples (205), and third in runs batted in (1,296) and hits.

A dominant hitter during the prime of his career, he led (or was in the top of) the league in most offensive categories, including batting average, runs scored, runs batted in (RBI), on-base percentage and hits. He won five batting titles – the most of any player in the 19th century – and his career .342 batting average ranks 12th all-time. Brouthers is one of only 31 players in baseball history who have appeared in Major League games in four decades.

He was also an active players&#x27; union member, and was elected vice president of the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players. In 1945, Brouthers was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Brouthers was born in Sylvan Lake, New York, to Michael and Annie Brooder, Catholic immigrants from Ireland; upon arriving in New York, Michael Brooder had been recruited to Dutchess County to work in open pit iron mines in the town of Beekman. Brouthers may have been named after Saint Denis, as a local Catholic church by that name was founded in the same year. Brouthers had siblings named Martin, Ellen, and Margaret. The spelling of the family&#x27;s name gradually shifted from &quot;Brooder&quot; to &quot;Bruder&quot; to &quot;Brouthers&quot; by 1880. The family eventually moved to the nearby hamlet of Fishkill Plains before settling in the village of Wappingers Falls where Michael found safer work at a textile printing mill.

Brouthers played organized baseball beginning in childhood, from playing in the local sandlots to the semi-professional Actives of Wappingers Falls. On July 7, , while running the bases, he collided at home plate with a catcher, named Johnny Quigley, of the Clippers of Harlem. Quigley was knocked unconscious, having suffered a traumatic head injury, and later died from these injuries on August 12. The 19-year-old Brouthers was cleared of any wrongdoing by the authorities.

==Major League career==

===Troy===
Brouthers made his Major League debut on June 23, , for the Troy Trojans, and contributed a single in a come-from-behind victory against the Syracuse Stars. Although he was a first baseman, he was called upon to pitch that season with the Trojans in three games, one of which was on August 21 against Tommy Bond and the Boston Red Caps. Brouthers lost 16–0, and within two weeks he was released from the club. He hit .274 that first season, with four home runs, and had 17 RBIs in 39 games played.

After his release, Brouthers played for a minor league team in Rochester, New York, and on one occasion in , he hit a game-winning home run in an exhibition game versus the Buffalo Bisons, off future Hall of Fame pitcher Pud Galvin. He hit well enough in the minors to get another shot with the Trojans, which lasted just three games when he had only two hits in 12 at bats, and he was released again.

===Buffalo===
Brouthers got his first chance to be an everyday player in , when he was signed by the Bisons, the team that he did well against the previous year. That season he batted .319, and played with them until the team folded after the season. In his first season with the Bisons, he led the National League (NL) in home runs and slugging percentage. Brouthers, along with teammates Jack Rowe, Hardy Richardson and Deacon White, became known as the &quot;Big Four&quot;. In 1882 and he won his first two batting titles, posting .368 and .374 averages, respectively. Along with his two batting titles, during his time in Buffalo he also led the NL in slugging five times, hits and total bases twice each, and triples and RBIs once each, with his 1883 total of 97 RBIs setting a new Major League record; Cap Anson had set the previous mark of 83 the year before, and retook the record the following year with a total of 102. On July 19, , Brouthers went 6-for-6 with two doubles in a 25–5 defeat of the Philadelphia Quakers.

===Detroit and The Brotherhood===

At the end of the season, Buffalo was going through financial trouble and were forced to sell off their players, so &quot;The Big Four&quot; were sold to the Detroit Wolverines of the NL for US$7,000. In , his first season in Detroit, he again led the league in slugging percentage, the sixth year in a row, and led the league in total bases and doubles and claimed his first home run title. He finished within the top 10 in most offensive categories, including a third-place finish in the batting race with a lofty .370 average. On September 10, , Brouthers hit three home runs‚ along with a double and a single, to set the NL record with 15 total bases in one game. This mark tied the Major League record at the time, as Guy Hecker of the Louisville Colonels totaled 15 the previous month in the American Association.

The Detroit team was filled with stars from the era, including future Hall of Famers Sam Thompson and Ned Hanlon, as well as second baseman Fred Dunlap, the &quot;Big Four&quot;, and the pitching of Lady Baldwin and Charlie Getzien. The team finished with a record of 87 wins and 36 losses, in second place behind the Chicago White Stockings by  games.

During the off-season, on November 11, , The Executive Council of the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players‚ formed in 1885 as the first organized players&#x27; union, met and re-elected John Montgomery Ward as president, and elected Brouthers as vice president.

In , with the 1886 roster intact, the Wolverines finished in first place, besting the Quakers by games. Brouthers batted .338, and led the league in runs scored with 153, doubles with 36, and on-base percentage, while again finishing in the top 10 in most offensive categories. The Wolverines, behind the bats of Brouthers, Thompson and Richardson, led the League in batting, runs scored and slugging, and went on to face the St. Louis Browns in a best-of-15 post-season tournament, the &quot;World&#x27;s Series&quot;. The Wolverines sealed a series championship with their eighth victory in 11 games; however, the two teams finished the series anyway, with Detroit winning 10 games to the Browns&#x27; five. Brouthers only played in one of those games, getting two hits in three at bats.

Following the season, on November 17, , members of the NL officially recognized the Brotherhood and met with a Brotherhood committee that consisted of three players – Ward‚ Hanlon and Brouthers.

The Detroit team did not fare as well, finishing in fifth place with a record of 68–63, which was a full 16 games behind the first-place New York Giants. Brouthers&#x27; numbers declined as well, as he did not produce at the same level of his previous seasons. Even with the lower numbers, he still led the league in runs scored with 118, and doubles for the third year in a row. The team&#x27;s decline is attributed to prolonged injuries sustained by key players, while turmoil that unfolded concerning veteran stars&#x27; salary demands, and with falling attendance numbers, the club was forced to fold at the season&#x27;s end. Brouthers was then purchased by the Boston Beaneaters of the NL on October 16.

===Boston===

In , his only season with the Beaneaters, he batted a league-leading .373, along with 105 runs scored and 118 runs batted in; he struck out only six times. The first strikeout occurred on June 11 against Mickey Welch of the Giants.

After the season, he – along with many Major League players – jumped to the Players&#x27; League, a league established by the Brotherhood which competed against the two other Major Leagues already in existence. Brouthers signed with the Boston Reds, and batted .330 while leading the league in on-base percentage and slugging. The Reds, behind the talents of Brouthers, Harry Stovey, Hardy Richardson, Charles Radbourn and player-manager King Kelly, finished in first place, games ahead of the Brooklyn Ward&#x27;s Wonders.

The Players&#x27; League lasted just the one season, and the Reds merged into the American Association, carrying many of the championship team&#x27;s previous players. Again, the team won the league&#x27;s championship, finishing games ahead of the St. Louis Browns. Brouthers led the league in batting average (.350), on-base percentage and slugging, while finishing second in triples with 19, sixth in doubles with 26, and third in RBIs with 109.

===Later career===

After the American Association folded following the season, Brouthers was sent to the Brooklyn Grooms of the NL, where he played two seasons. Most of his success came in that first season, when he led the league in batting average, hits, RBIs and total bases. For the season, he played in only 77 of the team&#x27;s games, but did well, hitting .337. After the season, Brouthers was traded along with Willie Keeler to the Baltimore Orioles for Billy Shindle and George Treadway.

This trade brought in two future Hall of Fame players, which added to the already established Orioles core of players including third baseman John McGraw, catcher Wilbert Robinson, shortstop Hughie Jennings, and center fielder Joe Kelley, all future Hall of Fame members. The Orioles won the league&#x27;s championship that season, and it was Brouthers&#x27; last full season in the majors, as he again produced great numbers, batting .347, finishing seventh in total bases, fifth in RBIs (128), fourth in doubles (39), and fifth in triples (23).

During his career, and most notably during his time in Baltimore, he was known to always have his dog, an Irish setter named Kelly, and had him sit in the players&#x27; area. It is claimed that the players never minded much, as he was very well-behaved and never left the area to run out on the field or made much noise.

Early in the season, Baltimore sold Brouthers to the Louisville Colonels for $500, as his skills seemed to have diminished, and he only played in 24 of Louisville&#x27;s games that season; he came back to hit .309 for them, ending the year with a .300 overall mark. Following the season, Louisville sold him to the Philadelphia Phillies for $500, where he played in 57 games in , batting .344. It was his last season in the majors until he appeared for the New York Giants, where he was hitless in a two-game stint before retiring.

Brouthers is still among the all-time leaders in many offensive categories. His .342 batting average ranks ninth, 205 triples ranks eighth, and his .423 on-base percentage ranks 15th. He is tied with Mike Tiernan for fourth among 19th-century home run hitters with a total of 106, behind Roger Connor (138), Sam Thompson (127), and Stovey (122).

==Later life and legacy==

Brouthers played minor league baseball for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Eastern League, where he won a batting title with a .415 average. Later he played for the Poughkeepsie Colts of the Hudson River League, batting a league-leading .373 at age 46.

He remained near baseball for many years, working for his former teammate and New York Giants manager John McGraw, who placed him in charge of the Polo Grounds press gate. He was with the Giants for nearly 20 years in this and other capacities.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1884, Brouthers married Mary Ellen Croak, an Irish immigrant to New York and fellow Catholic, at St. Mary&#x27;s in Wappingers Falls. They had four children together and were married for 48 years until his death.

Brouthers died at the age of 74 at his home in East Orange, New Jersey, and is interred at St. Mary&#x27;s Church Cemetery in Wappingers Falls, New York. There is a statue dedicated to him located in Veteran&#x27;s Park in the same village. In , Brouthers and several other stars of the era prior to 1910 were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee. In honor of his achievements in Buffalo, he was inducted into the newly formed Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985. In 1999, a survey of the Society for American Baseball Research ranked him as the sixth-greatest player of the 19th century.
