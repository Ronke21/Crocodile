<text>AgustaWestland was an Anglo-Italian helicopter design and manufacturing company, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Finmeccanica (now known as Leonardo). It was formed in July 2000 as an Anglo-Italian multinational company, when Finmeccanica and GKN merged their respective helicopter subsidiaries (Agusta and Westland Helicopters) to form AgustaWestland, with each holding a 50% share. Finmeccanica acquired GKN&#x27;s stake in AgustaWestland in 2004.

In 2016, AgustaWestland was merged into Leonardo S.p.A. (formerly Finmeccanica), where it became the company&#x27;s helicopters division under the Leonardo Helicopters brand. 

==History==
The collaboration between Agusta and Westland dates back to 1981, when the two companies established the European Helicopter Industries joint venture with the aim of developing a new medium-size utility helicopter, the EH101.

In March 1999, Finmeccanica and GKN announced their intention to merge their respective helicopter subsidiaries. The two parties announced finalised terms for the merger in July 2000, which included a 50-50 ownership structure, and the payment of top-up fees to GKN to compensate for a disparity in profit levels between Agusta and Westland.

In January 2002, AgustaWestland announced that it would be cutting a total of 950 jobs in the United Kingdom and closing its factory in Weston-super-Mare, which carried out customer support work, as activity was concentrated at its main site in Yeovil.
On 26 May 2004, GKN confirmed that it had agreed to sell its share of AgustaWestland to Finmeccanica for £1.06 billion. The sale was approved by the British government in October 2004.

AgustaWestland opened offices in Philadelphia in 2005 and won a contract to build the new presidential helicopter Marine One over the U.S. manufacturer Sikorsky Aircraft, but this program was cancelled in 2009. In November 2005, it was announced that AgustaWestland had agreed to acquire Bell Helicopter&#x27;s 25 per cent interest in the AB139 medium twin helicopter program, and to increase its interest in the BA609 civil tiltrotor aircraft from 25 per cent to 40 per cent.
In June 2008, AgustaWestland and the Russia-based helicopter manufacturer Russian Helicopters agreed to form a new joint venture company to assemble AW139 helicopters in Russia. Construction of a $50 million helicopter assembly facility in the town of Tomilino near Moscow began in June 2010.

In early 2010, AgustaWestland acquired PZL-Świdnik, a Polish helicopter manufacturer.

In September 2012, AgustaWestland and Northrop Grumman announced the signing of a comprehensive teaming agreement under which the companies would jointly bid for contracts to build the U.S. Air Force Combat Rescue helicopter and U.S. Navy&#x27;s new &quot;Marine One&quot; presidential helicopter.

In March 2013, AgustaWestland announced its Project Zero hybrid tiltrotor/fan-in-wing technology demonstrator. The unmanned demonstrator made its first tethered flight in June 2011 at AgustaWestland&#x27;s Cascina Costa, Italy facility. According to the company, the aircraft &quot;employs no hydraulics, doesn&#x27;t burn fossil fuel and generates zero emissions.&quot;

=== AgustaWestland AW101 order controversy ===

India signed a contract to purchase 12 AgustaWestland AW101 helicopters in February 2010 for the Communication Squadron of Indian Air Force to carry the president, PM and other VVIPs. The contract was frozen in February 2013 after allegations surfaced that US$60 million had been paid as a bribe. On 12 February 2013, Giuseppe Orsi, the CEO of Finmeccanica, was arrested by Italian authorities; the following day Indian Defence Minister A.K. Antony ordered a probe into the contract. 

In January 2014, India cancelled the US$630 million deal, subsequently recovering the sum which it had paid.

=== Merger into Leonardo ===
In 2016, following a corporate reorganisation, AgustaWestland merged into Leonardo S.p.A., Finmeccanica&#x27;s new name. With this reorganidation, AgustaWestland ceased to exist as a separate company, and it became Leonardo&#x27;s helicopter division.

In 2020 Leonardo relaunched the &quot;Agusta&quot; brand for the VIP helicopter sector. The launch of the new brand was announced during Expo 2020 in Dubai.

<text>Lunéville ( ; German : &quot;Lünstadt&quot; ; Lorrain: &quot;Leneinvile&quot;) is a commune in the northeastern French department of Meurthe-et-Moselle.

It is a subprefecture of the department and lies on the river Meurthe at its confluence with the Vezouze.

==History==

Lunéville was a renowned resort in the 18th century, known as the capital of Lorraine. The grand Château de Lunéville, built in 1702 for Leopold, Duke of Lorraine to replace an older palace, was the residence of the duke of Lorraine until the duchy was annexed by France in 1766. The château was designed in the style of Versailles to satisfy Leopold&#x27;s wife, Élisabeth Charlotte d&#x27;Orléans, the niece of Louis XIV, and became known as the &quot;Versailles of Lorraine&quot;. It includes a chapel designed by Germain Boffrand. Leopold and his wife were the parents of Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine and Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor (through him they were the grandparents of Marie Antoinette).

The last duke of Lorraine was Stanislaus I, the former king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. A devout Catholic, an author and a philanthropist, Stanislaus had a church built and several follies in his gardens for the amusement and education of visiting Polish and Lithuanian nobility and followers of the Enlightenment. The more famous visitors to his court were Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, André Morellet, and Montesquieu. After the death of his father-in-law in 1766, Louis XV of France annexed the duchy and turned the castle into a barracks, but much of the original construction has survived, and what remains is open to the public and the château&#x27;s intricate parterre gardens, designed by Yves Hours (a pupil of André Le Nôtre) in 1711 and Louis de Nesle in 1724, are a public park today.

It was over the nearby Parroy Forest, directly east of Lunéville, only some 11 months after the outbreak of World War I, that the first aerial victory by a fighter aircraft armed with a synchronised machine gun occurred on 1 July 1915, as the German &quot;Fliegertruppe&quot; officer Kurt Wintgens forced down an &quot;Aeronautique Militaire&quot; Morane-Saulnier L parasol monoplane. Neither member of the French air crew was seriously wounded, while the French aircraft&#x27;s Gnome Lambda engine received multiple hits to disable the aircraft.

==Treaties==
The Treaty of Lunéville was signed at 61 Rue de Lorraine (Treaty House), one of the houses built up against the château gardens of Lunéville, on 9 February 1801 between the French Republic and the Austrian Empire by Joseph Bonaparte and Count Ludwig von Cobenzl.

Another treaty, signed in Germany, was the Treaty of Frankfurt (1871). It made Lunéville into a border town that attracted people from Alsace and Moselle who relocated to keep their French nationality. A new period of economic prosperity, known as the Belle Époque, restored some of the glory of Stanislas&#x27;s ducal court of the 18th century.

==Industry==

Lunéville faience, a kind of unglazed faience produced from 1723 at Lunéville by Jacques Chambrette, became the Manufacture &quot;Royale du Roi de Pologne&quot; (“Royal Factory of the King of Poland”) after Stanislaus sponsored it in 1749. The earthenware first became famous for its detailed figurines and in the 20th century for its art deco designs, and it still exists today as &quot;Terres d&#x27;Est&quot;.

In 1858, the glass factory of Croismare was built. It became famous when the Müller brothers settled there in 1897 and began creating Art Deco glass designs.

Louis Ferry-Bonnechaux discovered a technique using beads and sequins on embroidery in 1865. His craft was widely copied and became known as Lunéville Point, and its heritage can still be seen in modern haute couture.

A subsidiary of the Dietrich company, Lorraine-Dietrich moved to Lunéville after the 1871 treaty of Frankfurt. Today it is known for its trailers, but it started off as a manufacturer of cars and railway equipment.

== Demographics ==
The population of Lunéville in 2019 was 17,867.

<text>Jean-Sifrein Maury (; 26 June 1746 – 10 May 1817) was a French cardinal, archbishop of Paris, and former bishop of Montefiascone.

==Biography==
The son of a cobbler, he was born at Valréas in the Comtat-Venaissin, the enclave within France that belonged to the pope. He had three brothers.

His first steps in education took place at the school in Valréas, where he completed the course in humanities at the age of thirteen. He spent a year at the minor seminary (high school) of Sainte-Garde, and then transferred to the major seminary of St. Charles, which was run by the Sulpician fathers. His acuteness was observed by the priests of the seminary at Avignon, where he was educated. He received the subdiaconate at Meaux.

In 1765 he took up residence in Paris. He was ordained a priest at Sens by Cardinal Paul d&#x27;Albert de Luynes in 1767, having been granted a dispensation because he was below the canonical minimum age.

===Early efforts in eloquence===
He tried his fortune by writing &quot;éloges&quot; of famous persons, then a favorite practice, beginning with King Stanislaus of Poland in 1766 and Charles V in 1767. On 25 August 1771, the Académie française awarded his &quot;Éloge&quot; on Fénelon the second prize, second only to that by La Harpe. Fénelon&#x27;s grand-nephew, Leo François Ferdinand Salignac de La Mothe-Fénelon, who was bishop of Lombez (1771–1788), was so impressed by Maury&#x27;s laudation of his relative that he granted him a canonry in his cathedral and named him a Vicar General.

The real foundation of his fortunes was the success of a panegyric on Saint Louis, delivered in the chapel of the Louvre on 25 August 1772, before the Académie française, who caused him to be recommended to Cardinal De La Roche-Aymon, the prelate responsible for the dispensation of royal benefices. Maury was granted the Abbey of La Frénade in the diocese of Saintes &quot;in commendam&quot;. The Cardinal also appointed him to preach before the King on Holy Thursday 1773, during Advent 1773, and at Versailles during Lent 1775.

In 1777 he published under the title of &quot;Discours choisis&quot; his panegyrics on Saint Louis, Saint Augustine and Fénelon, his remarks on Bossuet and his &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;éloquence de la chaire&quot;, a volume which contains much good criticism, and remained a French classic through the nineteenth century, as long as elegant rhetoric was valued in the pulpit. The book was often reprinted as &quot;Principes de l&#x27;éloquence&quot;. He became a favorite preacher in Paris, and was Lent preacher at court in 1781, when King Louis XVI said of his sermon: &quot;If the abbé had said only a few words on religion, he would have discussed every possible subject.&quot;

In 1786, he obtained the rich priory of Saint Pierre, to which belonged the Seigneurie de Lihons-en-Santerre (Lyons), near Péronne;

===Politician in the revolution===

In 1785 Abbé Maury was elected to the Académie française, successor to the chair formerly occupied by Lefranc de Pompignan. His morals were as loose as those of his great rival Mirabeau, but he was famed in Paris for his wit and gaiety.

He was elected a member of the Estates-General of 1789 by the clergy of the &quot;bailliage&quot; of Péronne, proving from the first to be the most able and persevering defender of the ancien régime. (He had, nonetheless, drawn up the greater part of the &quot;cahier&quot; of the clergy of Péronne which contained a considerable programme of reform.) It is said that he attempted to emigrate both in July and in October 1789, having been placed on a list of proscriptions by the Orléanist faction, but after that time, deserted by nearly all his friends, he decided to remain in France.

In the National Constituent Assembly he took an active part in every important debate, combating with especial vigour the alienation of the property of the clergy. He often got the better of his principal antagonist, Mirabeau, but he did not win a single vote.Maury&#x27;s eloquence could not exactly be described as studied; yet it was the outcome of a well-stored mind, long trained in oratory; and hence, his speeches read far better than his rival&#x27;s, whose rugged genius poured forth its torrents regardless of the rules of rhetoric. Mirabeau triumphed, because he was the man of the hour, giving voice to the unavenged wrongs and pent-up passions of millions. Maury fell back, step by step, with his face to the foe, making the conquerors pay dearly for their victory. On 2 November 1789, Catholic Church property that was held for purposes of church revenue was nationalized. On 13 February 1790, monastic vows were forbidden and all ecclesiastical orders and congregations were dissolved. On 12 July 1790 the Civil Constitution of the Clergy became law, provoking a schism between France and the Catholic Church, and the breaking off of diplomatic relations between Rome and Paris. His life was often in danger, and he received a letter from Louis XVI on 3 February 1791, recommending greater circumspection and prudence. But his ready wit always saved him, and it was said that one &quot;bon mot&quot; would preserve him for a month. He finally decided, however, that it was too dangerous for him to remain in France, and in October 1791 he fled to Bruxelles, then Coblenz, and finally Rome.

When he did emigrate, he found himself regarded as a martyr to the church and the king. On 17 April 1792 Pope Pius VI appointed Maury to be his Nuncio in Frankfort, where the imperial diet intended to elect Francis II of Austria as Holy Roman Emperor. He appointed him Archbishop of Nicaea &quot;in partibus&quot; (Turkey) on 24 April 1792. He was consecrated in Rome in the Vatican Basilica at the altar of the Chair of Saint Peter on 1 May 1792 by Cardinal Francesco Saverio de Zelada.

===Cardinal===
On 21 February 1794, Maury was named a cardinal by Pope Pius VI, and on 12 September was assigned the titular church of Santissima Trinità dei Monti in Rome. On the day he was named cardinal, he was also made bishop of Montefiascone in Italy. There he settled down, conducted a thorough diocesan visitation, and wrote a detailed report of the status of the diocese for the Sacred Congregation of the Council in Rome (15 November 1796). He held a diocesan synod for the clergy, and made judicious use of the exiled French clergy, improving the teaching at the diocesan seminary by appointing two doctors of the Sorbonne. In 1798, however, the French drove him from his diocese and from the Papal States, and all of his property and benefices were confiscated by order of General Berthier on 12 February 1798. Pope Pius VI, already a captive, through one of his chamberlains ordered Maury to flee. He attempted to seek refuge in Florence, but the Duke was under French pressure to expel him. He did, however, provide Maury with a disguise and a place on a mission he was sending to Venice, where Maury finally settled, under the protection of the Austrians who had taken Venice from Napoleon – who had destroyed the Serene Republic. He arrived in Venice on 17 April 1798.

===Conclave in Venice===
Pope Pius VI died in the prison fortress of Valence on 29 August 1799. Before being deported to France he had signed and sealed several bulls which allowed the Cardinals to hold a conclave elsewhere than in Rome, if Rome were occupied by enemies, and dispensing them from the observance of the usual rules and regulations governing a conclave, as had been embodied in various papal bulls since the thirteenth century. There were no cardinals left in Rome or the Papal States, and those who had fled to Naples were driven out when a popular uprising created the Parthenopean Republic. The only friendly territory appeared to be Austrian, and the cardinals gradually headed for Venice. Maury, who was in Venice, had already been commissioned by Louis XVIII to work for the assembling of a conclave. In a letter to Louis on 12 October, Maury noted that there were twenty-three cardinals assembled in Venice. On 2 November 1799, there were thirty-three cardinals in Venice, and ultimately thirty-five took part, once the Austrian Herzan and the Spaniard Lorenzana arrived. The opening ceremonies took place on 30 November 1799.

Maury was the only one of the five French cardinals at the conclave in Venice. He was not himself a viable candidate. He had no party of supporters, and he was generally looked askance at because he was French. The Austrian government named him as one of the cardinals who was absolutely unacceptable as pope. They preferred Cardinal Alessandro Mattei of Florence (a native Roman), who had signed the Treaty of Tolentino with Napoleon on behalf of Pope Pius VI, since it acknowledged Austria&#x27;s possession of the three Italian legations of the Papal States. Others, led by Cardinal Albani, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, and including Maury, preferred Cardinal Carlo Bellisomi, Bishop of Cesena, a diplomat with experience in Cologne and Portugal. Each of these candidates had enough committed votes to prevent the other from reaching the required 2/3 of the electors, and therefore they excluded each other. Finally, after three months and fourteen days, and with some hard work by Maury and others behind the scenes, the cardinals chose the Benedictine Bishop of Imola, Gregorio Barnaba Chiaramonti, an accommodating person with no strong positions.

===Bonapartist===
Maury accompanied Pope Pius on his journey to Rome from Venice, and then traveled himself to Montefiascone. On 21 April 1800, the exiled Louis XVIII wrote to Maury, thanking him for his services at the conclave just concluded, and enclosing the documents which named Maury as his Minister before the Holy See. Thereafter Maury made regular trips to Rome, on behalf of the affairs of Louis XVIII, but also to report to Pius about his correspondence and information gathering about the French bishops who had refused the oath to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and gone into exile. But the papal government, led by Cardinal Ercole Consalvi, was preparing to come to terms with Napoleon. In the autumn of 1800, Pius VII sent Archbishop Giuseppe Spina to Vercelli for conversations with the First Consul. Before he set out, Maury held several conversations with him, attempting to get Spina to come over to the side of the Bourbons. Spina was noncommittal, but Maury failed. When negotiations began in Paris which led to the Concordat of 1801, the French government insisted that Maury not be consulted or informed, and indeed that he should be kept out of Rome entirely. When the Concordat was signed, Louis XVIII was livid, believing that he had been betrayed by people in Rome whom he had believed to be his friends and supporters, including the Pope and Maury.

In 1804, having discovered the direction of papal policy and feeling the estrangement with Louis XVIII, Cardinal Maury began to prepare his return to France by a well-turned letter to Napoleon, congratulating him on restoring religion to France once more. On 18 May Napoleon was declared Emperor of the French, and in December Pius VII participated in his coronation in Notre Dame in Paris. In 1806 he did return and in 1807 was again received into the Académie française.

The Archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Jean-Baptiste de Belloy died on 10 June 1808. By imperial decree, Napoleon I, Emperor of the French nominated his uncle, Cardinal Joseph Fesch, to the See of Paris This was his right, in accordance with the Concordat of 1801, Article 5, but Fesch was quite aware that Pius VII, who was Napoleon&#x27;s prisoner, was refusing to provide bulls of institution for any bishops nominated by Bonaparte. On the refusal of Cardinal Fesch, on 10 October 1810 Napoleon nominated Maury. He also suggested to the Chapter of the cathedral of Paris that they elect him &quot;Administrator capitular&quot; of the diocese. The suggestion was immediately obeyed, by the majority of the Canons. Maury never called himself Archbishop of Paris, only archbishop-designate and Capitular Administrator of the diocese during the &quot;Sede vacante&quot;. On 5 November 1810, he was ordered by the pope to cease his activities in the diocese of Paris, and threatened him with ecclesiastical censures if he persisted, but Maury refused, claiming that the papal letter was a forgery. Napoleon tried unsuccessfully to break this impasse by calling a church council in Paris.

On 9 April 1814, the Chapter of Notre Dame met and revoked the powers which they had bestowed on Cardinal Maury in 1810. On 3 May 1814, therefore, in the &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Gravissimis de Causis&quot;, Pope Pius VII suspended him from all episcopal functions in the dioceses of Montefiascone and Corneto. On the Bourbon restoration toward the end of 1814, he was summarily expelled from the French Academy and from the archiepiscopal palace in Paris. He was ordered to leave France by the Comte d&#x27;Artois, Lieutenant-General of the Realm.

Maury retired to Rome. On the news of Napoleon&#x27;s escape from Elba, Pius VII fled from the city, leaving the pro-Secretary of State, Cardinal Bartolomeo Pacca in charge. Pacca took advantage of the moment and ordered Maury imprisoned in the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo, on 12 May 1815, for his disobedience to the papal orders. He was held for three months and fourteen days, until Consalvi returned from Vienna and ordered him released. He was allowed to take up residence in the novice house of the Lazarist fathers at San Silvestro al Quirinale.

Louis XVIII dealt another blow to Cardinal Maury&#x27;s prestige and &quot;amour propre&quot;. On 28 March 1816, he issued a royal ordonnance, restoring the pre-revolutionary titles and structure of France&#x27;s academies, and adding lists of members. Maury&#x27;s name was deliberately left off the list of members of the Académie française.

Maury died on 10 May 1817, primarily from a disease contracted in prison, thought to have been scurvy.

<doc id="510194" wikidata="Q2145163" url="?curid=510194" title="Trunk road">
<text>A trunk road is a major highway with a specific legal classification in some jurisdictions, notably the United Kingdom, Sweden and formerly Ireland. Trunk roads are planned and managed at the national-level, distinguishing them from non-trunk roads which are managed by local authorities. Trunk roads are important routes usually connecting two or more cities, ports, airports and other places, which is the recommended route for long-distance and freight traffic. Many trunk roads have segregated lanes in a dual carriageway, or are of motorway standard.

The term trunk road, or trunk highway, is sometimes used more generically to refer to other categories of major highway.

==United Kingdom==


In the United Kingdom, trunk roads were first defined for Great Britain in the Trunk Roads Act 1936 (1 Edw. 8. &amp; 1 Geo. 6. c. 5). Thirty major roads were classed as trunk roads, and the Minister of Transport took direct control of them and the bridges across them. The Trunk Roads Act came into force in England and Wales on 1 April 1937, and in Scotland on 16 May 1937. This development did not extend to Northern Ireland, which has always had a separate system of highway and road traffic law.

At that time, of British roads were classified as trunk roads. Additional roads have been &quot;trunked&quot;, notably in the Trunk Roads Act 1946 (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 6. c. 30). Others, like virtually all British motorways, have entered the system as a result of new construction. As of 2004, Great Britain had 7,845 mi (12,625 km) of trunk roads, of which 2,161 mi (3,478 km) were motorways.

Since 1994, trunk roads in England have been managed by National Highways (formerly Highways England, and before that, Highways Agency), while Scotland has had responsibility for its own trunk roads since 1998; these are currently managed by Transport Scotland, created in 2006. The Welsh Government has had responsibility for trunk roads in Wales since its establishment in 1998.

England has , Scotland has and Wales has of trunk roads, inclusive of motorways. National Highways publishes a full network map of trunk roads and motorways in England.

Most interurban trunk roads are primary routes, the category of roads recommended for long distance and freight transport. Not all primary routes are trunk roads, the difference being that maintenance of trunk roads is paid for by national government bodies rather than the local councils in whose area they lie. Primary routes are identified by their direction signs, which feature white text on a green background with route numbers in yellow. Trunk roads, like other &quot;A&quot; roads, can be either single- or dual-carriageway.

Historically, trunk roads were listed on maps with a &quot;T&quot; in brackets after their number, to distinguish them from non-trunk parts of the same road, however this suffix is no longer included on current Ordnance Survey maps, which simply distinguish between primary and non-primary &quot;A&quot; roads. A trunk road which has been upgraded to motorway standards may retain its original &quot;A&quot; number, but with an &quot;M&quot; in brackets to denote that motorway regulations apply on it. Long distance examples of this are the A1(M) in England, and the A74(M) in Scotland.

===De-trunking===
It is possible for roads to be &quot;de-trunked&quot; – for example, when superseded by a motorway following a similar route – in which case they normally become ordinary &quot;A&quot; roads. When a road is de-trunked, signposts are often replaced, and sometimes route numbers are changed, making the original route of the road harder to follow. Roads are formally and legally detrunked by statutory instruments named &#x27;Detrunking (or sometimes &quot;De-Trunking&quot;) Orders&#x27; which include a plan of the route being detrunked. The routes to be detrunked (as set out in detrunking orders) are not always linear sections, but can be split into multiple sections, and span multiple counties.

In England, the government has de-trunked much of the trunk road network since the late 1990s, transferring responsibility to local councils to allow National Highways to concentrate on a selection of core trunk routes, mostly dual carriageways and motorways.

== Sweden ==

The most important roads in Sweden are labelled &quot;national trunk road&quot;. In 1982, the parliament decided upon which roads were to become national trunk roads. They are considered recommended main roads for long-distance traffic. They were also supposed to be used for movement and transport of heavy military vehicles, ordnance and logistics and during wartime were to be guarded and defended at all odds.

National trunk roads are planned and managed by the national Swedish Transport Administration, as opposed to other roads, which are planned locally. They also have a special, slightly larger budget. However, they are not signed in any special way. Therefore, there is no difference in signage, numbering, road standard or map marking from other national roads. Some national roads are only considered trunk for part of their length. National Roads 73 and 75 are both built to motorway standard and have high traffic, but are not considered trunk. European routes are always trunk in Sweden, and are more visible with special numbering.

==Ireland==

In Ireland, major roads were previously classified under an old system as &quot;trunk roads&quot;, and had route numbers prefixed by a &quot;T&quot;. Connecting roads were classified as &#x27;link roads&quot;, and had route numbers prefixed by an &quot;L&quot;. Many of these roads had their origins in historic routes, including turnpike roads.

Although a number of old road signs using these route designations may still be encountered, Ireland has adopted a newer classification scheme of national primary and national secondary routes (&quot;N&quot; roads), regional roads, and local roads. &quot;N&quot; roads remain equivalent to trunk roads in that they are planned and managed at the national level by the National Roads Authority.

===De-trunking===
Some former trunk roads, or sections of former trunk roads, became non-trunk regional roads under the new road numbering system introduced in the 1970s and 1980s. More recently, sections of former national primary routes which have been bypassed by motorways or other road improvement schemes have been downgraded to regional road status.

==Equivalents in other countries==
The route nationale system in France and the national roads network in Poland are similar models of nationally planned and managed major highways.

In the United States, the U.S. Highway and Interstate Highway systems fulfil a similar role to trunk roads. However, individual states are responsible for actual highway construction and maintenance, even though the federal government helps fund these activities. The states of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin designate their highways as &quot;state trunklines&quot; or &quot;(state) trunk highways&quot;.

In India they are the national highways and expressways in India. The term &quot;trunk road&quot; sometimes appears in the names of specific routes, most famously the Grand Trunk Road.

In Canada, core national routes are part of the National Highway System, which receive some funding and strategic planning from the federal government, but are managed by the provinces.

In China, major national roads are part of China National Highways and Expressways of China.

<text>VG Airlines, later Delsey Airlines, (airline code IV, later assigned to Windjet) was a short-lived airline with its head office in Merksem, Antwerp, Belgium.

==History==
VG Airlines was founded in 2002 to operate flights from Belgium to North America in the wake of Sabena&#x27;s bankruptcy. The airline was rebranded as Delsey Airlines, (named after Delsey Suitcases) but it ceased operations in November 2002. The pencil dark and light grey aircraft livery design with the feathered Belgian flag on the tailfin of VG Airlines was created by Lila Design in the Netherlands as well as the Delsey Airlines aircraft paint concept.

==Destinations==
The airline operated flights from Brussels to Boston, Los Angeles, and New York–JFK in the United States.

<doc id="510199" wikidata="Q2564196" url="?curid=510199" title="1971 in video games">
<text>1971 is the first year of the commercial video game industry with the release of &quot;Computer Space&quot; by Nutting Associates and &quot;Galaxy Game&quot; by Mini-Computer Applications. The majority of digital games remained on mainframe computers and time-sharing networks, while an increasing number were demonstrated outside of traditional computing audiences. Several developments of games later commercialized – including &quot;Oregon Trail&quot; and the Magnavox Odyssey console – are first publicly tested in this period.

==Events==
*March 11 – A preliminary agreement is signed between Magnavox and Sanders Associates to license the patents by Ralph Baer and William Rusch for the technology of the Brown Box home video game prototype. Magnavox would begin development on a product based on this technology, initially dubbed Skill-O-Vision.
*Spring – Nolan Bushnell establishes contact with coin-op game manufacturer Nutting Associates. He joins the company as chief engineer with an agreement to separately license the game and technology developed by himself and Ted Dabney to be manufactured by the company.
*July 26-30 – Magnavox initiates its first test market of its home video game system in Grand Rapids, Michigan at their authorized dealer Williams Magnavox Home Entertainment Center at the Eastbrook Mall.
*August – The initial prototype of &quot;Computer Space&quot; is tested at a bar called the Dutch Goose in Menlo Park, California.
*August 2-4 – The second U.S. Computer Chess Championship is held in Chicago. The winner of the previous competition, Chess 3.0, wins for a second year.
*October – A second test market of the Magnavox home video game is held in Los Angeles at three stores under product manager Robert Fritsche.
*October 15-17 – &quot;Computer Space&quot; is shown at the Music Operators of America show in Chicago, Illinois by Nutting Associates. Though the game attracts some notice, distributors do not place any orders for the game.

== Financial performance ==

=== United States ===

==== Arcade ====
== Notable releases ==

=== Games ===

==== Arcade ====
* Late November – The first prototype of &quot;Galaxy Game&quot; is placed on location at the Stanford University Tressider Union by Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck, operating under the name Minicomputer Applications. The initial version enables one on one player at one dime per play or three players for a quarter.
* November or December – &quot;Computer Space&quot; by Nutting Associates ships, becoming the first commercially-available coin-operated video game.

==== Computer ====
* Summer – High school student Mike Mayfield developers the game &quot;Star Trek&quot; in BASIC on an SDS Sigma 7 at University of California at Berkeley. The following year it was added to Hewlett-Packard’s contributed programming library and became a staple of timeshared computer networks.
* December 3 – The program &quot;OREGON&quot; is showcased to students of student teacher Don Rawitsch at Jordan Junior High in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It had been earlier tested by the students of Paul Dillenberger and Bill Heinemann at Bryant Junior High.
* University of California Pomona student Don Daglow writes two games for the PDP-10 computer, one called &quot;Baseball&quot; and another called &quot;Star Trek&quot;. He would later become a prominent game designer and producer.

* At Carleton College, students create several graphical games including one replicating pinball on a graphical terminal.

== Business ==

* January – The legal partnership between Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney is formalized as the Syzygy Company. Their name on the cabinet of &quot;Computer Space&quot; is rendered as “Syzygy Engineering.”
* September 4 – Ramtek Corporation, one of the first companies involved with coin-operated video games, is founded to produce graphical terminals.

<text>The Douglas XTB2D Skypirate (also known as the Devastator II) was a torpedo bomber intended for service with the United States Navy&#x27;s &quot;Midway&quot;- and &quot;Essex&quot;-class aircraft carriers; it was too large for earlier decks. Two prototypes were completed, but the dedicated torpedo bomber was becoming an outdated concept, and with the end of World War II, the type was deemed unnecessary and cancelled.

==Design and development==
In 1939, Douglas designers Ed Heinemann and Bob Donovan began work on a VTB Proposal to replace the TBD Devastator torpedo bomber. In 1942, the team led by Heinemann and Donovan began work on a new project named the &quot;Devastator II&quot;. On 31 October 1943, just four days after the very large s were ordered into production, Douglas received a contract for two prototypes, designated TB2D, receiving the official name: &quot;Skypirate&quot;.

The TB2D was powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major driving contra-rotating propellers. Four torpedoes (such as the Mark 13 torpedo) or an equivalent bomb load could be carried on underwing pylons. Defensive armament consisted of two 20 mm (.79 in) cannon in the wings and .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns mounted in a power-operated dorsal turret.

Very large for a single-engined aircraft, the TB2D would have been the largest carrierborne aircraft at the time; it could carry four times the weapon load of the Grumman TBF Avenger. With only limited support from the US Navy, and facing a recommendation for cancellation on 20 May 1944 due to the aircraft being designed only for the CVB carriers, the TB2D project was in peril even at the design and mockup stage.

==Operational history==
The two &quot;Skypirate&quot; prototypes, BuNo 36933 and 36934, were ready for flight trials in 1945 with the first prototype XTB2D-1 flying on 13 March 1945. The second example had a 58 cm increase in the length of the fuselage, and flew later in summer 1945. Both prototypes were test flown without any armament. Despite the flying trials proceeding on schedule, the collapse of the Japanese forces in the Pacific along with delays in the &quot;Midway&quot; class, eliminated the need for the type and the 23 pre-production aircraft on order were subsequently cancelled. The flight trials were suspended and the two prototypes were eventually reduced to scrap in 1948.

<doc id="510207" wikidata="Q2031596" url="?curid=510207" title="Zariski tangent space">
<text>In algebraic geometry, the Zariski tangent space is a construction that defines a tangent space at a point &quot;P&quot; on an algebraic variety &quot;V&quot; (and more generally). It does not use differential calculus, being based directly on abstract algebra, and in the most concrete cases just the theory of a system of linear equations.

== Motivation ==
For example, suppose &quot;C&quot; is a plane curve defined by a polynomial equation

:&quot;F&quot;(&quot;X,Y&quot;) &quot;= 0&quot;

and take &quot;P&quot; to be the origin (0,0). Erasing terms of higher order than 1 would produce a &#x27;linearised&#x27; equation reading

:&quot;L&quot;(&quot;X,Y&quot;) &quot;= 0&quot;

in which all terms &quot;XaYb&quot; have been discarded if &quot;a + b &gt; 1&quot;.

We have two cases: &quot;L&quot; may be 0, or it may be the equation of a line. In the first case the (Zariski) tangent space to &quot;C&quot; at (0,0) is the whole plane, considered as a two-dimensional affine space. In the second case, the tangent space is that line, considered as affine space. (The question of the origin comes up, when we take &quot;P&quot; as a general point on &quot;C&quot;; it is better to say &#x27;affine space&#x27; and then note that &quot;P&quot; is a natural origin, rather than insist directly that it is a vector space.)

It is easy to see that over the real field we can obtain &quot;L&quot; in terms of the first partial derivatives of &quot;F&quot;. When those both are 0 at &quot;P&quot;, we have a singular point (double point, cusp or something more complicated). The general definition is that &quot;singular points&quot; of &quot;C&quot; are the cases when the tangent space has dimension 2.

== Definition ==
The cotangent space of a local ring &quot;R&quot;, with maximal ideal formula_1 is defined to be
:formula_2
where formula_12 is given by the product of ideals. It is a vector space over the residue field &quot;k:= R/formula_1&quot;. Its dual (as a &quot;k&quot;-vector space) is called tangent space of &quot;R&quot;.

This definition is a generalization of the above example to higher dimensions: suppose given an affine algebraic variety &quot;V&quot; and a point &quot;v&quot; of &quot;V&quot;. Morally, modding out &quot;formula_12&quot; corresponds to dropping the non-linear terms from the equations defining &quot;V&quot; inside some affine space, therefore giving a system of linear equations that define the tangent space.

The tangent space formula_6 and cotangent space formula_7 to a scheme &quot;X&quot; at a point &quot;P&quot; is the (co)tangent space of formula_8. Due to the functoriality of Spec, the natural quotient map formula_9 induces a homomorphism formula_10 for &quot;X&quot;=Spec(&quot;R&quot;), &quot;P&quot; a point in &quot;Y&quot;=Spec(&quot;R/I&quot;). This is used to embed formula_11 in formula_12. Since morphisms of fields are injective, the surjection of the residue fields induced by &quot;g&quot; is an isomorphism. Then a morphism &quot;k&quot; of the cotangent spaces is induced by &quot;g&quot;, given by

:formula_13
:formula_14
:formula_15
:formula_16

Since this is a surjection, the transpose formula_17 is an injection.

(One often defines the tangent and cotangent spaces for a manifold in the analogous manner.)

== Analytic functions ==
If &quot;V&quot; is a subvariety of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space, defined by an ideal &quot;I&quot;, then &quot;R = Fn&quot; / &quot;I&quot;, where &quot;Fn&quot; is the ring of smooth/analytic/holomorphic functions on this vector space. The Zariski tangent space at &quot;x&quot; is
:&quot;mn /&quot; (&quot;I+mn2&quot;)&quot;,&quot;
where &quot;mn&quot; is the maximal ideal consisting of those functions in &quot;Fn&quot; vanishing at &quot;x&quot;.

In the planar example above, &quot;I&quot; = (&quot;F&quot;(&quot;X,Y&quot;)), and &quot;I+m2 =&quot; (&quot;L&quot;(&quot;X,Y&quot;))&quot;+m2.&quot;

== Properties ==
If &quot;R&quot; is a Noetherian local ring, the dimension of the tangent space is at least the dimension of &quot;R&quot;:
:formula_18

&quot;R&quot; is called regular if equality holds. In a more geometric parlance, when &quot;R&quot; is the local ring of a variety &quot;V&quot; at a point &quot;v&quot;, one also says that &quot;v&quot; is a regular point. Otherwise it is called a singular point.

The tangent space has an interpretation in terms of &quot;K&quot;[&quot;t&quot;]&quot;/&quot;(&quot;t2&quot;), the dual numbers for &quot;K&quot;; in the parlance of schemes, morphisms from &quot;Spec&quot; &quot;K&quot;[&quot;t&quot;]&quot;/&quot;(&quot;t2&quot;) to a scheme &quot;X&quot; over &quot;K&quot; correspond to a choice of a rational point &quot;x ∈ X(k)&quot; and an element of the tangent space at &quot;x&quot;. Therefore, one also talks about tangent vectors. See also: tangent space to a functor.

In general, the dimension of the Zariski tangent space can be extremely large. For example, let formula_19 be the ring of continuously differentiable real-valued functions on formula_20. Define formula_21 to be the ring of germs of such functions at the origin. Then &quot;R&quot; is a local ring, and its maximal ideal &quot;m&quot; consists of all germs which vanish at the origin. The functions formula_22 for formula_23 define linearly independent vectors in the Zariski cotangent space formula_2, so the dimension of formula_2 is at least the formula_26, the cardinality of the continuum. The dimension of the Zariski tangent space formula_27 is therefore at least formula_28. On the other hand, the ring of germs of smooth functions at a point in an &quot;n&quot;-manifold has an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Zariski cotangent space.

<text>1972 marked an important landmark in the history of the video game industry with the releases of &quot;Pong&quot; and the Odyssey home console. The profile of electronic games rose substantially and companies began exploring the distribution of video games on a larger scale. Important mainframe computer games were created in this period which became the basis for early microcomputer games.

==Events==
*May 3 – Magnavox initiates their “Magnavox Profit Caravan” series of traveling shows to demonstrate all of their 1972 product line to their dealers and public, including the Odyssey. The first showing occurs in Phoenix, Arizona.
**May 24 – At a showing in Burlingame, California, three representatives of Nutting Associates including Nolan Bushnell visit the showcase and play the Odyssey demonstration unit. Bushnell takes particular note of the Odyssey game &quot;Table Tennis&quot;.
*June 26 – Bally Manufacturing formalizes an agreement with Nolan Bushnell for the creation of one video game and one pinball table for Bally. Bushnell later describes the creation of a hockey game. The term “video amusement game” is used by Bushnell – one of the earliest instances of the phrase “video game” in print.
*August – Atari Inc. tests a prototype of &quot;Pong&quot; at Andy Capp’s Tavern (later the Rooster T. Feathers Comedy Club) in Sunnyvale, California.
*August 13–15 – Chess 3.0 wins the U.S. American Computer Chess Championship in Boston, Massachusetts for the third consecutive year.
*September 14–16 – The Music Operators of America show is held in Chicago, Illinois. Nutting Associates displays &quot;Computer Space&quot; for the second year and For-Play Manufacturing showcases &quot;Star Trek&quot; as the only two video games on the show floor.
*October 19 – The Intergalactic Spacewar Olympics competition is held at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project facilities in California. It is the first formal video game competition and is a central story in the December 7, 1972 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; written by Stewart Brand.
*November 24 – Nolan Bushnell files for US patent #3,793,483 relating to work developed for video game technology. The patent is issued in February 1974 and does not serve as an effective deterrent to video game copycats.

== Financial performance ==

=== United States ===

==== Arcade ====
==== Home consoles ====
== Notable releases ==

=== Publications ===

* October – The date of the first issue of the &quot;People’s Computer Company&quot; newsletter by Dymax Inc. They print type-in listings of games and other demonstrations in the BASIC programming language, helping to spread games originally created on time-sharing networks.

=== Games ===

==== Arcade ====
*March – The second unit of the &quot;Galaxy Game&quot; is placed at the Tresidder Student Union at Stanford University. This version features two fiberglass cabinets with two players each, which can be linked to create a four-player game.
*October – Coin-operated games company For-Play Manufacturing in California releases &quot;Star Trek&quot; (1972) – a presumed clone of Nutting Associates’ &quot;Computer Space&quot;.
*November – Atari Inc. releases their game &quot;Pong&quot;, shipping it to local distributors in the Northern California area. The game becomes a hit in the local area and launches Atari’s business.

==== Computer ====
*&quot;Empire&quot; by Reed College student Peter Langston is created for the HP2000 computer.
*Louis Bloomfield of University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana creates the game &quot;Moonwar&quot; for the PLATO IV mainframe system. It becomes the most popular “big board” game on the network.

=== Hardware ===

==== Consoles ====
*September – Magnavox releases their Odyssey console in twenty-five major markets. It includes twelve games with the console. A light gun addon with additional games is sold separately. They manufacture 140,000 consoles their first year on the market.

== Business ==

* June 27 – Atari Inc. is founded by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney in Sunnyvale, California. They absorb the assets of their prior partnership, Syzygy, though continue using the name Syzygy under a doing business as association.
* Dymax Inc. establishes a location in Menlo Park, California. They invite interested individuals to visit the location to access time-sharing terminals at the location to create and use programs – many of which are published in the &quot;People&#x27;s Computer Company&quot; newsletter.

<text>Nicolas Restif de la Bretonne, born Nicolas-Edme Rétif or Nicolas-Edme Restif (; 23 October 1734 – 3 February 1806), also known as Rétif, was a French novelist. The term &quot;retifism&quot; for shoe fetishism was named after him (an early novel, entitled &quot;Fanchette&#x27;s Foot&quot;, follows a beautiful heroine and her pretty little foot, which, with her pretty face, gets her and her shoe/s into lots of trouble). He was also reputed to have coined the term &quot;pornographer&quot; in the same-named book, &quot;The Pornographer.&quot;

==Biography==
Born the son of a farmer at Sacy (in present-day Yonne), Rétif was educated by the Jansenists at Bicêtre, and on the expulsion of the Jansenists was received by one of his brothers, who was a &quot;curé&quot;. Owing to a scandal in which he was involved, he was apprenticed to a printer at Auxerre, and, having served his time, went to Paris. Here he worked as a journeyman printer, and in 1760 he married Anne or Agnès Lebègue, a relation of his former master at Auxerre. Soon he embraced Protestantism.

It was not until five or six years after his marriage that Rétif appeared as an author, and from that time to his death he produced a bewildering multitude of books, amounting to something like two hundred volumes, many of them printed with his own hand, on almost every conceivable subject. Rétif suffered at one time or another the extremes of poverty. He drew on the episodes of his own life for his books, which, &quot;in spite of their faded sentiment, contain truthful pictures of French society on the eve of the Revolution&quot;. He has been described as both a social realist and a sexual fantasist in his writings.

The original editions of these, and indeed of all his books, have long been bibliographical curiosities owing to their rarity, the beautiful and curious illustrations which many of them contain, and the quaint typographic system in which most are composed on.

The fall of the assignats during the Revolution forced him to make his living by writing, profiting on the new freedom of the press. In 1795 he received a gratuity of 2000 francs from the Thermidor Convention.
In spite of his declarations for the new power, his aristocratic acquaintances and his reputation made him fall in disgrace. Just before his death, Napoleon gave him a place in the ministry of police; he died at Paris before taking up the position.

==Assessment==
According to 1911 Britannica,
He and the Marquis de Sade maintained a mutual hatred, while he was appreciated by Benjamin Constant and Friedrich von Schiller and appeared at the table of Alexandre Balthazar Laurent Grimod de La Reynière, whom he met in 1782.
Jean François de La Harpe nicknamed him &quot;the Voltaire of the chambermaids&quot;.
He was rediscovered by the Surrealists in the early 20th century.

He is also noted for his advocacy of communism, indeed the term first made its modern appearance (1785) in his book review of Joseph-Alexandre-Victor Hupay de Fuveau who described himself as &quot;communist&quot; with his &quot;Project for a Philosophical Community&quot;.

The author Mario Vargas Llosa has a chapter on Rétif in his novel&quot; The Notebooks of Don Rigoberto&quot;.

The French novelist Catherine Rihoit made Restif de la Bretonne a major character in her 1982 novel &quot;La Nuit de Varenne&quot;. It was made into a film in the same year, a French-Italian production called either &quot;La Nuit de Varennes&quot; (French title, in English, &quot;That Night in Varennes)&quot; or &quot;Il mondo nuovo&quot; (Italian title, in English, &quot;The New World&quot;). Jean-Louis Barrault played Restif. The film also had Marcello Mastroianni as Casanova and Harvey Keitel as Thomas Paine.

In his analysis of the satirical poem &quot;Ode to Buggers,&quot; David M. Halperin suggested that Rétif&#x27;s writing may have drawn from internal conflicts surrounding his sexuality. There is much scholarly debate over the veracity of this conclusion.

Rétif was a &quot;pornographer&quot; in the modern sense of the word, being a writer of graphic depictions of sex. However, he was also a &quot;pornographer&quot; in the Ancient Greek sense of the word, as he wrote about the day-to-day life of prostitutes, and concerned himself with their well-being. It was the latter definition which he accepted as the rightful use of the word.

==Works==

The most noteworthy of his works are:
*&quot;Le Pied de Fanchette&quot;, a novel (1769), the story of a pretty French orphan girl who is hounded by shoe-fetishists. 
*&quot;Le Pornographe&quot; (1769), a plan for regulating prostitution which is said to have been actually carried out by the Emperor Joseph II, while not a few detached hints have been adopted by continental nations
*&quot;Le Paysan perverti&quot; (1775), an erotic novel with a moral purpose, which is a big hit, causing him to follow it with &quot;La Paysanne Pervertie&quot; (1784).
*&quot;La Vie de mon père&quot; (1779)
*&quot;La Découverte Australe par un Homme-Volant&quot; (1781), a work of proto-science-fiction notorious for its prophetic inventions.
*&quot;Les Contemporaines&quot; (42 vols., 1780–1785), a vast collection of short stories
*&quot;Ingenue Saxancour&quot;, also a novel (1785)
*&quot;Les Nuits de Paris&quot; (beginning 1786: reportage including the September Massacres of 1792)
* &quot;Anti-Justine&quot; (1793), an answer to the earlier editions of the Marquis de Sade&#x27;s &quot;Justine&quot;.
*The extraordinary autobiography of &quot;Monsieur Nicolas&quot; (16 vols., 1794–1797), in which at the age of sixty he has set down his remembrances, his notions on ethical and social points, his hatreds, and above all his numerous loves, both real and fancied. In it, Rétif relates the beginnings of his sexual awakenings between 1738 and 1744, when he remembers experiencing the most pleasurable of sexual stimulations in very early childhood (see text for details). However, the last two volumes are practically a separate and much less interesting work in the opinion of the redactors of the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica.
*&quot;Les Posthumes&quot; (1802) is an example of early space opera and an exercise in exolinguistics.

<doc id="510214" wikidata="Q545559" url="?curid=510214" title="Pyhäjärvi (Tampere region)">
<text>Pyhäjärvi () is a lake in southern Finland. Although the name means &quot;holy lake&quot; in modern Finnish, it probably originally meant &quot;border lake&quot;. Pyhäjärvi is shaped like the letter C with the cities of Tampere and Nokia at the northern end, and the town of Lempäälä at the southern end.

The lake is fed by the water running through the Tammerkoski rapids in the center of Tampere from the north, and by the waters from lake Vanajavesi in the south. Due to the Tammerkoski rapids, the water in Pyhäjärvi is warmer and richer in ozone than that in the northern lake, Näsijärvi, which results in the life in this lake being richer, even though the water is more polluted.

A number of other lakes are also named Pyhäjärvi in Finland and its former territories.

<text>Davenport is a district of Stockport, Greater Manchester, England; until 1974, it was part of Cheshire. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 14,924.

== History ==
Davenport&#x27;s name arose from the building of Davenport railway station at the behest of the Davenport family, who since the later 14th century had owned Bramall Hall in the neighbouring village of Bramhall. The family name came from an ancestral estate between Holmes Chapel and Congleton, in Mid Cheshire. The estate is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it is listed as &quot;Deneport&quot;.

Originally, Davenport&#x27;s expansion in the 1850s consisted of three key routes, Bramhall Lane, Kennerley Road and Buxton Road, all of which remain in place today.

The 1900s saw an increase in construction of residential houses and commercial developments. The aftermath of World War II saw the demolition of larger, older properties in extensive gardens to make way for smaller private residences and flats.

==Transport==

The railway station, at Davenport&#x27;s main road junction, allows travel by rail towards Manchester Piccadilly, Stockport, Hazel Grove and Buxton. Services are generally half-hourly, but hourly on Sundays.

Local bus services are operated by Stagecoach. Routes include the regular 192 service along Buxton Road between Manchester and Hazel Grove.

== Places of interest ==

Cale Green Park is a popular local attraction with its bowling green, tennis court, basketball court and playground.

Stockport Lacrosse Club, the oldest in the world, have played at Cale Green Cricket Club since 1876.

== Education ==

Adswood Primary School and St Ambrose Catholic Primary School are the nearest primary schools.

Stockport Grammar School, founded in 1485, lies next to Davenport Park on Buxton Road, whilst immediately across the road is, Stockport School founded in 1888.

<text>The Lurline Baths were public salt water baths built in 1894 in San Francisco, California, at the corner of Bush and Larkin streets. The Lurline Baths closed in 1936. The Lurline Pier, also known as the Olympic Pier, at Ocean Beach between Anza and Balboa Streets was built to protect the intake pipe that provided seawater to the baths. The pier existed until about 1966.

The Olympic Salt Water Company owned the baths, which included a swimming pool and water slide. Founded in 1892, the company also supplied water to the Olympic Club as well as smaller commercial baths. Use of sea water for bathing and in swimming pools was common in the 19th century before pollution became an issue. The company built a water distribution system of the intake pipe located 600 feet offshore, almost 4 miles of iron pipe along present-day Geary Boulevard, a water pump, and the reservoir tank located on Laurel Heights. Gravity brought the water to downtown and the customers.

The baths were immortalized by Thomas Edison in August 1897 when he captured 20 seconds (50 feet) of film featuring scenes from the Lurline pool; the main feature is the water slide with some going down in a sitting position and others lying down, head first or feet first.

<doc id="510237" wikidata="Q923372" url="?curid=510237" title="Reading frame">
<text>In molecular biology, a reading frame is a way of dividing the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) molecule into a set of consecutive, non-overlapping triplets. Where these triplets equate to amino acids or stop signals during translation, they are called codons.

A single strand of a nucleic acid molecule has a phosphoryl end, called the 5′-end, and a hydroxyl or 3′-end. These define the 5′→3′ direction. There are three reading frames that can be read in this 5′→3′ direction, each beginning from a different nucleotide in a triplet. In a double stranded nucleic acid, an additional three reading frames may be read from the other, complementary strand in the 5′→3′ direction along this strand. As the two strands of a double-stranded nucleic acid molecule are antiparallel, the 5′→3′ direction on the second strand corresponds to the 3′→5′ direction along the first strand.

In general, at the most, one reading frame in a given section of a nucleic acid, is biologically relevant (open reading frame). Some viral transcripts can be translated using multiple, overlapping reading frames. There is one known example of overlapping reading frames in mammalian mitochondrial DNA: coding portions of genes for 2 subunits of ATPase overlap.

== Genetic code ==
DNA encodes protein sequence by a series of three-nucleotide codons. Any given sequence of DNA can therefore be read in six different ways: Three reading frames in one direction (starting at different nucleotides) and three in the opposite direction. During transcription, the RNA polymerase read the template DNA strand in the 3′→5′ direction, but the mRNA is formed in the 5′ to 3′ direction. The mRNA is single-stranded and therefore only contains three possible reading frames, of which only one is translated. The codons of the mRNA reading frame are translated in the 5′→3′ direction into amino acids by a ribosome to produce a polypeptide chain.

==Open reading frame==

An open reading frame (ORF) is a reading frame that has the potential to be transcribed into RNA and translated into protein. It requires a continuous sequence of DNA which may include a start codon, through a subsequent region which has a length that is a multiple of 3 nucleotides, to a stop codon in the same reading frame.

When a putative amino acid sequence resulting from the translation of an ORF remained unknown in mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes, the corresponding open reading frame was called an unidentified reading frame (URF). For example, the MT-ATP8 gene was first described as URF A6L when the complete human mitochondrial genome was sequenced.

==Multiple reading frames==
The usage of multiple reading frames leads to the possibility of overlapping genes; there may be many of these in viral, prokaryote, and mitochondrial genomes. Some viruses, e.g. hepatitis B virus and BYDV, use several overlapping genes in different reading frames.

In rare cases, a ribosome may shift from one frame to another during translation of an mRNA (translational frameshift). This causes the first part of the mRNA to be translated in one reading frame, and the latter part to be translated in a different reading frame. This is distinct from a frameshift mutation, as the nucleotide sequence (DNA or RNA) is not altered—only the frame in which it is read.

<doc id="510249" wikidata="Q504090" url="?curid=510249" title="Saxon (band)">
<text>Saxon are an English heavy metal band formed in Barnsley in 1975. As leaders of the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM), they had eight UK Top 40 albums during the 1980s including four UK Top 10 albums and two Top 5 albums. They had numerous hit singles on the UK Singles Chart and experienced success all over Europe, South America and Japan, as well as in the United States.

During the 1980s, Saxon established themselves among Europe&#x27;s most successful metal acts. The band tours regularly and have sold more than 23 million records worldwide.

== History ==
=== Formation and early years (1975–1979) ===
Saxon came together from components of two Yorkshire bands: S.O.B. and Coast. The former was initially called Blue Condition, forming in 1970 with Graham Oliver on guitar, Steve &quot;Dobby&quot; Dawson on bass, and John Walker on drums. Their style was blues rock and hard rock. Shifting the line-up, Blue Condition changed their name to S.O.B. in 1974, taking inspiration from the 1969 Free album &quot;Tons of Sobs&quot;. Meanwhile, Coast was a local rival rock band named after the 1972 song &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; by Trapeze. Coast contained singer and bass player Peter &quot;Biff&quot; Byford, and guitarist Paul Quinn. In 1975, Coast was falling apart, and S.O.B.&#x27;s lead singer and guitarist Steve Furth left to go solo, so in November 1975 a new band was formed by S.O.B.&#x27;s Oliver, Dawson and Walker, and Coast&#x27;s Byford and Quinn. Byford became the new lead singer. They adopted the name Son of a Bitch for its more aggressive tone, and they pushed toward a heavier sound. They recorded a demo known as &quot;Tapestry&quot; in late 1975 and gigged extensively during 1975–1978. Walker quit after a couple of years, and was replaced briefly by Dave Cowell in 1977. Former Glitter Band member Pete Gill soon replaced Cowell as drummer.

In 1978, the band began negotiating with the French disco-oriented record label Carrere Records, run by Freddy Cannon in the UK. Carrere refused the band name Son of a Bitch because it would be impossible to obtain radio airplay, so the band changed their name to Saxon in July, and signed a contract with Carrere in September. They began by supporting established bands such as Motörhead and Ian Gillan Band, and released their first album &quot;Saxon&quot; in 1979.

=== Success in the UK (1980–1982) ===
&quot;Wheels of Steel&quot;, released in 1980, charted at No. 5 in the UK Albums Chart. It resulted in two hit songs: the title track and the crowd favourite &quot;747 (Strangers in the Night)&quot;. As a result, Saxon began a series of long UK tours. On 16 August, they earned a positive reception at the first Monsters of Rock festival, commemorated by the following year&#x27;s &quot;And the Bands Played On&quot;. Their set was recorded, but not officially released until 2000. In April, Saxon made the first of many appearances on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, performing the hit &quot;Wheels of Steel&quot;.
&quot;Strong Arm of the Law&quot; was released later in the year, charting at No. 11 in the UK. Two singles were issued: the title track and &quot;Dallas 1PM&quot;, the latter about the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. Sold-out tours of Europe and the UK followed as the album charted in several European countries. The band was also popular in Japan, where the single &quot;Motorcycle Man&quot; stayed in the charts for almost six months.

&quot;On the &quot;Strong Arm of the Law&quot; tour, in 1981, we met Harry Shearer,&quot; Dawson recalled. &quot;We thought he was just an American journalist. He spent three days on the road with us. [When] we all went to see &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, I didn&#x27;t recognise Harry. I was too busy laughing my head off. But some of the other guys didn&#x27;t see the funny side.&quot;

In 1981, the band released their fourth album &quot;Denim and Leather&quot;, dedicated to their fan base. Still popular today, its title track &quot;Denim and Leather&quot; is regarded as a metal anthem. The album also featured fan favourites such as &quot;Princess of the Night&quot;, &quot;Never Surrender&quot;, and &quot;And the Bands Played On&quot; – all UK Top 20 hits. &quot;Denim and Leather&quot; followed its predecessor&#x27;s success and went Gold in several European countries, including the UK. By this time, the band was seen as the leaders of the NWOBHM movement, with future greats Iron Maiden and Def Leppard following close behind.

Just as the band was to embark on a long tour to follow the success of &quot;Denim and Leather&quot;, drummer Pete Gill left, after injuring his hand. The band quickly replaced him with Nigel Glockler, formerly of Toyah, who had to learn the entire set within a day and a half. Glockler is still with the band today.

Headlining tours around the UK and a sold-out tour in Europe with support act Ozzy Osbourne resulted in &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; (1982, UK No. 5). It was planned as a double album, but the record company decided to release it as a single live album, despite protests from the band. Saxon also played the Monsters of Rock festival again in 1982, becoming the first band to appear there twice.

=== &quot;Power &amp; the Glory&quot; and EMI years (1983–1987) ===
As the NWOBHM movement began to fade, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Power &amp; the Glory&quot;, their best-selling album to date, saw Saxon confirmed as one of the leading metal acts in Europe, along with Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. The &quot;Power and Glory Tour&quot; was an arena tour that began in Europe and was a huge success. The US leg of the tour, as special guest to Iron Maiden, along with Fastway, proved to be successful and Saxon found themselves becoming a major act in the US as the album, in its first week of release, sold more than 15,000 copies in Los Angeles alone. The cover art of the album was produced by Hollywood film director Ridley Scott.

In late 1983, Saxon left Carrere and signed with EMI Records in 1984, with their first release on the label being &quot;Crusader&quot;. Though still heavy, critics felt the album had a more commercial sound, and fans began to wonder what direction the band was taking. Despite its commercial sound, the title track became a fan favourite. The album sold over two million copies and the 1984 world tour &quot;The World Crusade&quot; was a success both in Europe and America. In the US, the band toured with Accept as their special guests, as well as supporting Mötley Crüe for some shows of a yearlong tour.

With the release of &quot;Innocence Is No Excuse&quot; in 1985, the band continued to take a more commercial direction, and this divided fans as the band&#x27;s once raw, heavy sound had been watered down for the large US market. A huge sold out world tour in support of the album followed, but tensions began to appear within the band and, by early 1986, bassist Steve Dawson was fired, and Saxon was forced to record their eighth studio album &quot;Rock the Nations&quot; without a replacement. With Elton John making guest appearances as pianist on two tracks, and Byford recording the bass parts, the album charted higher than its predecessor and was considered a success. They hired bassist Paul Johnson to play for the band&#x27;s European arena tour that followed. In the summer of 1986, Saxon headlined the Reading Festival and toured the United States.

In 1987, the band took time off from the constant touring and recording that had begun in the mid 1970s, and only a minor tour of the U.S. and Canada was scheduled. In early 1987, Nigel Glockler left the band and was replaced by Nigel Durham.

=== Decline of fan base and continued European success (1988–1993) ===
The band found it hard to attain chart success in America; the release of &quot;Destiny&quot; (1988) did not change this, and Saxon were later dropped by EMI. In 1988, Paul Johnson was replaced by Nibbs Carter. Nigel Glockler also decided to return to the band. 1989 saw the release of &quot;Rock n Roll Gypsies&quot;, a live album recorded on an arena tour of eastern Europe in 1988, but by this time, the gigs at the big stadiums and arenas of Europe and the US were few and far between and, with no record deal, Saxon&#x27;s future was uncertain.

The band eventually decided to embark on a European tour titled &quot;10 Years of Denim and Leather&quot; which proved to be a successful move as the band was re-established as a popular act. In 1990, they signed to Virgin Records and started work on their new album &quot;Solid Ball of Rock&quot;, which was released in 1991 and proved to be successful. In 1992, Saxon sustained this success with the release of &quot;Forever Free&quot;. The album was produced by Biff Byford and Herwig Ursin. A UK version of the album featured an alternate cover with a &quot;Space Marine&quot; from the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop wargame. &quot;Iron Wheels&quot; was released as a single. The song was written about and dedicated to Byford&#x27;s father who worked in the coal mines of Yorkshire.

=== Departure of Graham Oliver and return to heavier sound (1994–2002) ===

During 1994, Saxon recorded the album &quot;Dogs of War&quot;. Shortly afterwards, Graham Oliver was fired by the band in 1996. The band replaced Oliver with Doug Scarratt, a longtime friend of drummer Nigel Glockler. Saxon recorded a new music video for &quot;Dogs of War&quot;. 1996 saw the release of another live album, &quot;The Eagle Has Landed Pt II&quot;. They also recorded a cover of the Judas Priest song &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Another Thing Comin&#x27;&quot;, for a tribute album entitled &quot;A Tribute to Judas Priest: Legends of Metal&quot;.

Saxon released &quot;Unleash the Beast&quot;, produced by Kalle Trapp and Saxon, in 1997. Saxon began their Unleash The Beast tour in May, where they played in Europe. &quot;Unleash the Beast&quot; reached the top 100 in the charts in Sweden, Germany and Switzerland. In November, they played two gigs in Brazil (São Paulo and Santos) and ended the year with a Christmas show in Belgium. In 1998, the band toured the US, as well as playing the Brazilian Monsters of Rock. After relentless touring, drummer Nigel Glockler took time off to recover from a neck and shoulder injury and was temporally replaced by Fritz Randow.

September 1999 saw the release of &quot;Metalhead&quot;. The album was praised in Germany where Saxon had begun to play the Wacken Open Air Festival, where they later became a regular fixture. Saxon also headlined the first Bloodstock Festival in the UK. In 2001, they again headlined the Wacken Open Air Festival and recorded the live DVD &quot;Saxon Chronicles&quot;. Saxon also released the album &quot;Killing Ground&quot; during the same year. In 2002, Saxon released &quot;Heavy Metal Thunder&quot;, a compilation album featuring re-recorded versions of songs from the band&#x27;s biggest selling albums.

=== Battle for band name and &quot;Lionheart&quot; (2003–2006) ===
In 1999, former members Graham Oliver and Steven Dawson registered &#x27;Saxon&#x27; as a trademark. They then maintained that they had exclusive rights to the name and tried to prevent Biff Byford and Saxon&#x27;s promoters and merchandisers from using the name. Byford applied to the Trade Mark Registry to have the trademark declared invalid. He applied on the basis that the registration had been obtained in bad faith and that he was entitled to prevent use of the trademark by bringing an action for &#x27;passing off&#x27;, that is an action to stop others misrepresenting themselves as Saxon. In 2003, the High Court declared that it was Byford and the current members of the band who owned the name, and were therefore in a position to prevent Oliver and Dawson passing themselves off as Saxon. After this Oliver and Dawson renamed their band Oliver/Dawson Saxon.
Fritz Randow left the band in 2004. His replacement was former Stratovarius member Jörg Michael. 2004 also saw the release of &quot;Lionheart&quot; their 16th studio album. The album title was inspired from Richard Lionheart, King of England. &quot;Beyond the Grave&quot; was released as a single and a music video. The album received positive reviews and the title track remains a fan favourite. Nigel Glockler rejoined the band in 2005. In 2006, the band released the live album, &quot;The Eagle Has Landed – Part III&quot;. The band were due to play that year&#x27;s Dubai Desert Rock Festival and perform alongside Megadeth. Just before the band were due to play Dubai&#x27;s Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing had withdrawn the band&#x27;s permission to play the festival. It was rumoured that the historical lyrics in &quot;Crusader&quot; were the reason for this.

=== Re-establishment in the UK (2007–2010) ===
In 2007, Saxon were the subject of an episode of &quot;Harvey Goldsmith&#x27;s Get Your Act Together&quot;. As part of his programme, Goldsmith wanted to try and restore their popularity and reputation. He drafted in two new producers to oversee the production of a new single &quot;If I Was You&quot; (a song about gun culture), which went to number one in the Rock Charts in over 10 countries (becoming their most successful single for over 12 years). At the end of the programme, Saxon played at the half sold out Sheffield City Hall. Saxon also performed at the 2008 Download Festival.

Saxon&#x27;s &quot;The Inner Sanctum&quot; album, released in Europe on 5 March 2007, and North America on 3 April, was seen by critics as their best work in years. The band then started a world tour in support of the album.
Saxon released a new studio album, &quot;Into the Labyrinth&quot;, on 12 January 2009. The album received positive reviews and continued the success that &quot;The Inner Sanctum&quot; had created. The band also headlined the Wacken Open Air Festival in Germany. In February, it was announced that the band were cancelling the Spanish leg of their European tour with Iced Earth, due to scheduling issues. At the start of 2009, they toured the UK with Doro, and again at the end of the year they did a UK tour, co-headlining with Motorhead. In August of that year, they played at Sonisphere. In September Saxon announced the release of &quot;Heavy Metal Thunder - The Movie&quot;, a documentary on the band&#x27;s history from the beginning.

Continuing their success in the UK, Saxon performed at the 2010 Download Festival, which took place at Donington Park between 11 and 13 June. The band played the &quot;Wheels of Steel&quot; album in its entirety to mark the 30th anniversary of its release.

=== &quot;Call to Arms&quot; and &quot;Sacrifice&quot; (2011–2014) ===
Saxon released their nineteenth studio album, &quot;Call to Arms&quot;, on 3 June 2011. It debuted at number 6 on the UK Rock Albums chart. The band embarked on a world tour which saw them visit the US; Saxon also revisited the UK for a second leg of the tour. The band announced on their Call To Arms tour that a number of fans at each venue, each paying £10, would be able to watch them soundcheck. This was donated to the Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy and Childline charities.

Saxon were billed as special guests supporting Judas Priest at Hammersmith Apollo on 26 May 2012. Saxon also played Download Festival 2012, and were recorded playing &quot;Wheels of Steel&quot; for the festival&#x27;s Highlights show shown on Sky Arts. On 13 February 2012, the band announced that they were releasing a new live DVD and CD package entitled &quot;Heavy Metal Thunder - Live: Eagles Over Wacken&quot;, which compiled their 2004, 2007 and 2009 performances at the Wacken Open Air across various formats. In March, Saxon won the Metal Hammer 2012 Golden God award for &#x27;Best UK band&#x27;.

In October, the band announced that their next studio album would be titled &quot;Sacrifice&quot; and it was released in March 2013. On 11 December 2012 &quot;Heavy Metal Thunder - The Movie&quot; saw an international release and was the first Blu-ray release for the band. 2013 also saw the release of a new compilation album &quot;Unplugged and Strung Up&quot;. 2014 saw the release of a new live album named &quot;St. George&#x27;s Day Sacrifice - Live in Manchester&quot;. The band also embarked on a tour in October of that year named Warriors of the Road.

=== &quot;Battering Ram&quot;, &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;, &quot;Inspirations&quot;, &quot;Carpe Diem&quot; (2015–2022) ===

During an interview in November 2014, Biff Byford revealed that: &quot;We&#x27;re making the new album in January, February and March&quot;. In a March 2015 interview, Byford described the album as a mixture of rock and roll and heavy metal. When asked about a possible release date, Byford said: &quot;We&#x27;re looking at maybe at a summer release. It just depends on whether it&#x27;s ready or not. We&#x27;re looking at finishing the album by the end of April. We&#x27;re keeping our fingers crossed.&quot;

On 1 August 2015, the band announced 16 October as the release date of &quot;Battering Ram&quot; and also premiered the official video of the title track.
On 14 September 2016, Biff Byford announced on Facebook that Saxon were working on a new album with producer Andy Sneap, for an early 2017 release. In October 2016, the band announced a tour in the U.S. for the early spring of 2017 with UFO. In a 16 March 2017 interview with former Anthrax vocalist Neil Turbin on Canada&#x27;s The Metal Voice in Los Angeles, California, Biff Byford gave an update on the new album saying that several songs were already recorded with a few more to complete, with an estimated release date for early 2018.

On 15 June 2017, Byford revealed that the title of their new studio album was &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;. Saxon and UFO teamed up again for another round of shows in North America for the fall. On 7 November 2017, the band announced that the album would be officially released on 2 February 2018. To support the album, they briefly toured Europe and the UK with Diamond Head, Rock Goddess and Magnum from late February to early March 2018, and was the support act along with Black Star Riders for Judas Priest&#x27;s Firepower World Tour from mid March to early May 2018.

Saxon released their first covers album &quot;Inspirations&quot; on 19 March 2021. Their 24th studio album &quot;Carpe Diem&quot;, was released on 4 February 2022, with the band embarking on the &quot;Seize The Day&quot; tour in support of the album.

=== &quot;More Inspirations&quot;, &quot;Hell, Fire and Damnation&quot; and next album (2023–present) ===
The follow-up covers album &quot;More Inspirations&quot; was released on 24 March 2023, with a further new studio album to be released in 2024.

On 10 March 2023, the band announced guitarist Paul Quinn&#x27;s retirement from touring, although they stated that he would continue his work in the studio. Diamond Head guitarist Brian Tatler was announced as their touring guitarist, but would continue to remain a member of his main band. Byford said that the band began the demo sessions for the next album. The resulting album titled &quot;Hell, Fire and Damnation&quot; was released on 19 January 2024. Saxon promoted the album by joining Judas Priest and Uriah Heep on the European Metal Masters tour in the spring of 2024, followed by a headlining North American tour (again with Uriah Heep). Tatler has since become a permanent member.

In February 2025, Byford revealed that Saxon have begun writing new material for their next album, which they plan to release around late 2026.

==Legacy==
Saxon have been cited as a major influence or inspiration by numerous bands, including Mötley Crüe, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Pantera, Testament, Dokken, Skid Row, Dream Theater, Exodus, Overkill, King Diamond and Celtic Frost.

<text>Big Train is a British television sketch show created by Arthur Mathews and Graham Linehan. The first series was broadcast on BBC Two in 1998, while the second, in which Linehan was not involved, aired in 2002.

==Overview==
The series starred the actors Kevin Eldon, Mark Heap and Simon Pegg in both series one and two, with Julia Davis and Amelia Bullmore in the first series (Nick Frost also appeared in two episodes), and Rebecca Front, Tracy-Ann Oberman and Catherine Tate in the second series. All starred in a variety of other comedy shows including &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;, &quot;Look Around You&quot;, &quot;Spaced&quot;, &quot;Smack the Pony&quot;, &quot;Brass Eye&quot; and &quot;Green Wing.&quot; Tate went on to get her own show on the BBC, &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot;. The first series was directed by Graham Linehan and other series contributors included David Mitchell and Robert Webb.

The pilot episode was directed by Chris Morris but was never broadcast in full. Some sketches from the pilot are scattered through the series. Apart from Pegg, all of the first-series regular cast members subsequently starred in Morris&#x27;s sketch comedy &quot;Jam&quot; (2000).

The title of the show is derived from the song run during the credits, &quot;Big Train&quot;, which was recorded by Max Greger and his Orchestra. The writers were fond enough of the song to name the show after it. The song has since been adopted for a commercial for Virgin Trains.

Both series were shot entirely on location (series one on 35 mm film and series two on DigiBeta) and later shown to a live audience so that a laugh track could be recorded.

==Comedy style and notable sketches==
Following in the tradition of Monty Python, the comedy of &quot;Big Train&quot; is based on the subversion of ordinary situations by the surreal or macabre. For example, one scene features a bad-mannered man casually stabbed to death by his embarrassed wife at a dinner party. In a recurring sketch from the first series, an animated staring contest is accompanied by commentary from BBC football commentator Barry Davies and comedy actor and impressionist Phil Cornwell. The Stare-out Championship was based on a self-published comic book by Paul Hatcher and was animated by Chris Shepherd. The championship is portrayed as a huge event akin to the World Cup and the anecdotes told by the commentators often echoed those from real sporting events, such as performance enhancing drugs, streakers and the theft of the trophy.

Some other notable sketches included:
*A Ming the Merciless-style galactic despot that struggles to subjugate planets and imprison princes while doing the housework, checking his answerphone and being hospitalised after &quot;slipping on the little mat that goes around the toilet&quot;
*A romantic drama conducted entirely in French in which a woman has a relationship with a set of temporary traffic lights, much to the anguish of her human admirer
*&quot;Fat handed twat&quot; – A man with unfeasibly large hands who is ridiculed by members of the public when engaging in any kind of detailed work, such as embroidery
*An office manager who repeatedly distracts his employees—when they demand their promised overtime payment—with magic tricks, juggling and cute animals before running from the office, hailing a taxicab and flying away aboard an airliner
*An English tourist asking two Frenchmen for directions, only to have them nonchalantly respond, in perfect English, that they cannot understand her as they do not speak English
*A series of sketches in which 1970s and 1980s pop musicians were placed in unusual or surreal contexts (such as Kevin Rowland from Dexys Midnight Runners being reanimated as Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster, Daryl Hall and John Oates acting as social workers, Keith Emerson as a medieval knight, and Chaka Khan as a Wild West bounty hunter pursuing the Bee Gees)
*An office where the manager decides to put a stop to wanking, much to the annoyance of his staff. A parody of the response by many to the smoking bans put in place by many companies in the UK around the time.

==Transmission details==
&quot;Big Train&quot; originally aired on BBC Two on Monday nights during the following periods:

* Series one (6 episodes): 9 November – 14 December 1998
* Series two (6 episodes): 7 January – 11 February 2002

== Reception ==

Despite running for two series, &quot;Big Train&quot; attracted only a limited audience. Even so, the series was well received by critics, with the first series voted &quot;Best &#x27;Broken Comedy&#x27; Show&quot; at the prestigious British Comedy Awards in 1999. &quot;The Independent&quot; called the show &quot;divine&quot;. Reviewing the DVD, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote: &quot;Like most sketch shows, &quot;Big Train&quot; is not without its misses, but as a breeding ground for comedy talent and a forefather to such modern-day hits as &quot;Little Britain&quot; and &quot;That Mitchell and Webb Look&quot;, it remains a gem, boasting some of the finest performances Pegg, Davis and the rest have ever delivered&quot;, whilst another author of the same publication called it &quot;one of the most original and most consistently funny sketch shows in years&quot;.

==Home media==
&#x27;The Complete Series 1 and 2&#x27; DVD has been released in the US and the UK.

From March 2021, both series became available on BritBox.

<doc id="510253" wikidata="Q82450" url="?curid=510253" title="Consolidated TBY Sea Wolf">
<text>The Consolidated TBY Sea Wolf was a United States Navy torpedo bomber of World War II. It was designed by Vought but entered service and was manufactured by Consolidated Aircraft due to high demand for production lines. A competitor and contemporary to the Grumman TBF Avenger, both were designed to replace the older TBD Devastator but the Sea Wolf was subject to substantial delays and never saw combat in WW2. The design was developed a bit further, with a large Navy order for 1100, but only 180 of the TBY-2 type were built before cancellation after VJ Day. An order of 600 for the TBY-3 was also stopped.

The first units were delivered in late 1944 and reserve units were training with it at the end of the war. It was in service for a few years with a reserve unit before being retired in the late 1940s. Major engagements, such as the invasion of Japan never materialized and it was out of service by the time of the Korean War.

Although the design had its first flight in December 1941 as the XTBU-1, Vought was busy with F4U production, and did not have the factory space. So it was going to be built by Consolidated-Vultee at a new factory, and this delayed its production and service entry. As with many WW2 aircraft designs, sweeping cancellations due to surplus and interest in new designs after the war meant the TBY was bypassed in favor of other aircraft. In particular, many navies were focusing on single-seat attack aircraft like the Martin AM Mauler or Blackburn Firebrand or much newer designs like jet aircraft such was the pace of aircraft development in this period.

== Design and development ==

The original design was not by Consolidated Aircraft but rather by Vought, who designed the then XTBU-1 Sea Wolf to meet a 1939 US Navy requirement. The first prototype flew two weeks after Pearl Harbor was attacked. Its performance was deemed superior to that of the Avenger, and the Navy placed an order for 1,000 examples.

Several unfortunate incidents intervened; the prototype was damaged in a rough arrested landing trial and, when repaired a month later, was again damaged in a collision with a training aircraft. Once repaired again, the prototype was accepted by the Navy. However, by this time, Vought was heavily overcommitted to other contracts, especially for the F4U Corsair fighter, and had no production capacity. It was arranged that Consolidated-Vultee would produce the aircraft (as the TBY), but this had to wait until the new production facility in Allentown, Pennsylvania, was complete, which took until late 1943.

The design was also used as the basis for the Vought V-326 testbed and research aircraft in the 1940s.

== Operational history ==

The production TBYs were radar-equipped, with a radome under the right-hand wing. The first newer aircraft flew on 20 August 1944. By this time the Avenger equipped every torpedo squadron in the Navy, and there was no need for the Sea Wolf; in addition, numerous small problems delayed entry into service. Orders were canceled after production started, and the 180 built were used for training.

The TBY-2 was delivered to the Navy on 7 November 1944 and equipped VT-97 by April 1945. The Navy canceled the rest of the order in September 1945 after VJ day and put its efforts into fielding the radar equipped Avenger. The end of the war also halted the development of the TBY-3. They were held in reserve in the late 1940s before finally being withdrawn.

In July 1945, one aircraft was damaged due to a collapsed landing gear, operating from NAS Patuxent River. Also, in July 1945, one airframe was lost when it crashed when it overshot the runway at Convair field. In January 1946, another landing incident damaged one at NAS Norfolk, another was damaged in a ground looping accident in April 1946 at NAS Anacostia. There were other small incidents in the late 1940s while they were in service.

<text>Marco Masini (born 18 September 1964) is an Italian singer-songwriter, musician and pianist.

As of 2021, he has released 11 studio albums, 12 compilations, and 3 live albums.

==Early years==

Marco Masini was born in the city of Florence, in the region of Tuscany, on 18 September 1964. His mother, Anna Maria, sang and played piano, and was an elementary school teacher before she quit the profession to have a life at home with the family. His father, Giancarlo, worked as a representative of hair products.

When Marco was three years old he received a toy piano as a Christmas present. The little boy showed an instant interest in music and soon he began attending music classes.

During high school he created, along with friends, a music group called Errata Corrige. Meanwhile, his lack of interest in studying made him leave high school when he was 16, which caused problems within his family.

For a time, Masini worked with his father as a representative. In 1980 the family opened a bar in Florence. The fights between Marco and his father increased, causing his mother worry and heartache. A few years later, her husband was forced to sell the bar after she was found to have cancer. Marco left to serve in the army (military aircraft in Florence), and only one day after his return on 22 August 1984, his mother died, to the deep sadness of Marco, who always regretted the fact that he could not be close to her in her last moments.

In his early years of his career he met the record producer Giancarlo Bigazzi who introduced the young musician to the music business, as a collaborator with artists like Raf and Umberto Tozzi. Eventually, in 1990 he participated in the 40th edition of popular Sanremo Festival with one of his signature songs, &quot;Disperato&quot;, and won first prize as new artist of the year.

==Fame and consecration==

After winning third place, now among the main competitors, in the 1991 edition of Sanremo Festival with &quot;Perché lo fai&quot; (a controversial song about an addicted young woman), Masini, now an emerging star, released his second album, &quot;Malinconoia&quot; (a composite word coined by the artist indicating a mixture of melancholy and boredom, in Italian &quot;malinconia&quot; and &quot;noia&quot;), that became a big hit in the Italian charts, despite the somber mood of most of the record. The &quot;Malinconoia&quot; music video, taped during a concert at Palaeur in Rome, won first prize in the category &quot;Best live video&quot; during the 1991 edition of Riminicinema festival. The title track was presented during the popular summer music competition Festivalbar in the long playing records category, and was awarded first prize.

In 1993 the album &quot;T&#x27;innamorerai&quot; was released. The record created the basis for the international success of Masini. The song that introduces the LP, &quot;Vaffanculo&quot; (figuratively &quot;fuck off&quot;), generated controversies and was banned by most radio and television networks. In an interview for the newspaper Corriere della Sera, Masini claimed that the v-word was dedicated to &quot;the liars and who call me &#x27;prophet of the depression&#x27;&quot; and the song contained also some harsh verses directed to the record labels and their policies.

In the meantime, Marco became an international sensation. With a style in both music and lyrics that synthesized his diverse musical influences, , Marco opened a new path in Italian music and popular culture. The album &quot;T&#x27;innamorerai&quot; became a huge hit, with over a million copies sold worldwide.

In 1995 (January), the fourth album was released, &quot;Il Cielo della Vergine&quot; in Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and the Spanish version (El Cielo de Virgo) in Spain and Latin America. For this album he was criticized again, this time because of two songs &quot;Bella Stronza&quot; (&quot;Beautiful Bitch&quot;) and &quot;Principessa&quot; (&quot;Princess&quot;), both very direct and explicit.

In 1996 he published &quot;L&#x27;Amore Sia Con Te&quot;, a compilation of his greatest hits, with the new song that gave title to the album and &quot;Meglio Solo&quot;, an old song, released originally as the B-side of the single &quot;Disperato&quot;. This collection was also released in Spanish speaking countries as &quot;Mi amor allí estará&quot;, presenting a slightly different tracklist. During the summer, the tour called L&#x27;amore Sia Con Te occurred.

In 1997, fellow singer-songwriter Enrico Ruggeri called him to sing &quot;La Gente di Cuore&quot;, included in the Ruggeri&#x27;s album &quot;Domani è un altro giorno&quot;.

After nearly four years of silence, on 12 November 1998, the &quot;Scimmie&quot; (&quot;Monkeys&quot;) album was released by Ma label, founded by himself, Mario Manzani and Marco Poggione. This new album was a major turning point in production, on which he presented himself to the public with a new look: white hair and beard. But the greatest change was the separation from Bigazzi, Marco&#x27;s old teacher, who had marked the beginning of his musical career. The disc is a harder rock and the lyrics are generally less sentimental but more airtight. With Scimmie, Marco said he wanted to recover the music from the 1970s that he loved and was back in fashion: the views of the critics were strangely positive, but not public opinion, which decreed the album&#x27;s commercial failure.

He&#x27;s an atheist, though he somewhat recognizes the &quot;importance of religion&quot; when a person is in trouble.

He has been engaged to Romina Contiero from 2001 to 2005.

He participated at the Sanremo Music Festival 2020 with the song &quot;Il confronto&quot;.

<text>Last Chance to See is a 1989 BBC radio documentary series and its accompanying book, written and presented by Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine. In the series, Adams and Carwardine travel to various locations in the hope of encountering species on the brink of extinction. The book was published in 1990.

In 2009, the BBC broadcast a television follow-up series of the same name, with Stephen Fry replacing the late Adams.

In 1985, Douglas Adams went to Madagascar in search of the (possibly extinct) lemur the aye-aye. The trip was part of a project by the World Wide Fund for Nature and British Sunday newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot;, sending well-known authors to remote places to seek endangered species and write articles for &quot;The Observer Magazine&quot;, to help raise awareness of ecological issues. Adams was met in Madagascar by zoologist Mark Carwardine (who was working for the WWF at the time). The &quot;Observer&quot; project was successful, and Adams and Carwardine developed a radio series around the same concept for BBC Radio 4. Carwardine later said:

: &quot;We put a big map of the world on a wall, Douglas stuck a pin in everywhere he fancied going, I stuck a pin in where all the endangered animals were, and we made a journey out of every place that had two pins.&quot;

The journeys undertaken were to see:
* The aye-aye in Madagascar
* The Komodo dragon on the island of Komodo in Indonesia
* The kākāpō in New Zealand
* The mountain gorilla in Zaire
* The northern white rhinoceros in Zaire
* The Yangtze river dolphin in China
* The Rodrigues fruit bat on the island of Rodrigues, Mauritius
* The Amazonian manatee in Brazil
* The Juan Fernández fur seal on the Juan Fernández Islands, Chile

==Radio==

The aye-aye programme was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 1 November 1985 as a pilot; six further episodes were then broadcast in 1989:
* The kākāpō - 4 October
* The Yangtze river dolphin - 11 October
* The Amazonian manatee - 18 October
* The Rodrigues fruit bat - 25 October
* The Komodo dragon - 1 November
* The Juan Fernández fur seal - 8 November

The mountain gorilla and northern white rhino, although the subject of chapters in the book, did not appear in the radio series.

==Book==
In 1990, an accompanying book was published in the UK, describing the various adventures that duo had encountered on journeys, often with a comic tone. The book covers most of the radio episodes, but excludes the Juan Fernández fur seal and the Amazonia manatee. It includes some colour photographs taken by Carwardine.

The first American hardcover edition was published by Harmony Books in 1991 (under ) and the first German paperback edition was published in 1992 by Heyne (under ). These editions carry slightly different photographs of the journeys. An abridged audiobook, read by Adams, was also published.

In the posthumous biography and essay collection, &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot;, Adams describes &quot;Last Chance to See&quot; as his favourite work.

==CD-ROM==
The Voyager Company also published a two CD-ROM set (for Microsoft Windows 3.1 and Macintosh System 6), in 1992, featuring over 800 still photographs, Adams reading the nearly complete book, Carwardine reading fact files on the species they searched - like side bars, and extracts from the BBC Radio 4 series.

==Television series==

In 2009, the BBC broadcast a television follow-up series, in which Stephen Fry, a friend of the late Adams, accompanies Carwardine on a journey to see what has changed in the 20 years since the radio broadcasts. The series excludes the Rodrigues fruit bat, the Yangtze river dolphin, which is &quot;in all probability extinct&quot;, and the Juan Fernandez fur seal, which had proved embarrassingly easy for Adams and Carwardine to find.

<text>The Alfred Ceramic Art Museum at Alfred University in Alfred, New York, United States houses nearly 8,000 ceramic and glass objects by internationally known ceramic artists. While originally housed in 1,500 sq. ft. of exhibition space in the New York State College of Ceramics&#x27; Binns-Merrill Hall, the museum&#x27;s new building was constructed in 2014 by KMW Architects to allow the museum to grow since the village of Alfred is known as a ceramics mecca.

Its collection includes ancient ceramics of anthropological interest, examples of historical and contemporary ceramic art and craft, and advanced ceramics created utilizing advanced ceramic engineering technology. The new building is located on the site of the former Davis Gym, on Pine Street just past its intersection with Main Street. Construction began June 2014 on a $10 million Alfred Museum of Ceramic Art. The university received a private donation to cover the cost of the new museum.

The museum is a teaching and research facility, and part of Alfred University.

<text>The AgustaWestland AW109, originally the Agusta A109, is a lightweight, twin-engine, eight-seat multi-purpose helicopter designed and initially produced by the Italian rotorcraft manufacturer Agusta. It was the first all-Italian helicopter to be mass-produced. Its production has been continued by Agusta&#x27;s successor companies, presently Leonardo (formerly AgustaWestland, merged into the new Finmeccanica since 2016).

Development of the A109 commenced during the late 1960s as an indigenous rotorcraft suited to commercial operations. A twin-engine arrangement was pursued in response to market interest, while work on the civil model was prioritised over the military-orientated &quot;A109B&quot; project. On 4 August 1971, the first of three prototypes made its maiden flight. On 1 June 1975, the type received certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), permitting its service entry in 1976. The A109 has been used in a wide variety of roles, including light utility, VIP transport, aeromedical, law enforcement, search and rescue (SAR), and several military roles. Dedicated military models have been produced for both land and sea operations. Several models with alternative engines, expanded fuselages, and alternative equipment fitouts have been produced. Some AW109s feature a convertible interior to quickly adapt the rotorcraft between roles. Various third-party companies also offer adaptions and services for the type.

Following the merger of Agusta and the British company Westland Helicopters to form AgustaWestland, the A109 was rebranded as the &quot;AW109&quot;. International involvement in the programme has also been pursued; the company has established final assembly lines at sites in both Italy and the US. Furthermore, hundreds of AW109 fuselages have been manufactured by the Polish aerospace company PZL-Świdnik since the mid-1990s. AgustaWestland formed a joint venture with the Changhe Aircraft Industries Corporation in 2004 that produces and supports the AW109, includes a final assembly line, in China. The AW109 has been in continuous production for 40 years. The AgustaWestland AW119 is a derivative of the AW109, the principal difference being that it is powered by a single engine and has a fixed undercarriage.

==Development==

===Origins===

Work on what would become the &quot;AW109&quot; commenced during the late 1960s at the Italian helicopter manufacturer Agusta, which sought to design an indigenous rotorcraft suitable for commercial activities. Known as the &quot;A109&quot;, early designs were of a single-engine helicopter. However, the design team came to recognise that the market found a twin-engine rotorcraft more attractive, so the project was revised in 1969, to outfit it with a pair of Allison 250-C14 turboshaft engines. While early considerations had been made for a militarised model, which the company internally referred to as the &quot;A109B&quot;, Agusta intentionally placed a low priority on the work for this variant in favour of other market sectors. In particular, design efforts were concentrated on the eight-seat &quot;A109C&quot; model.

On 4 August 1971, the first of three prototypes performed the type&#x27;s maiden flight. The A109 was subject to a protracted flight testing phase, which was largely attributable to the discovery of dynamic instability that took roughly one year to resolve via a modified transmission design. Almost four years later, the first production helicopter was officially completed during April 1975. On 1 June 1975, the type received certification for visual flight rules (VFR) from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), permitting the A109 to be operated in North America.

During 1976, deliveries of production A109s commenced to civil customers. The type offered several advantages over the then-market leading Bell 206, including its greater top speed, twin-engine redundancy, and increased seating capacity. In 1975, Agusta&#x27;s design team revisited the concept of a military version; to support their work, a series of flying trials were carried out between 1976 and 1977 involving a total of five A109As that had been outfitted with Hughes Aircraft-built TOW missiles. From these endeavours, two different military versions of the A109 emerged, one being intended for light attack/close air support missions while the other was optimised for shipboard operations.

===Further development===

Shortly following after the launch of the initial production model, Agusta begun work on additional models, primarily for the civil sector. During 1981, an &quot;A109A Mk2&quot;, that featured a widened cabin, was made available to operators. In 1993, the &quot;A109 K2&quot; model was introduced, which was powered by alternative engine in the form of the Turbomeca Arriel 1K1. During 1996, the &quot;A109 Power&quot; was launched, which was broadly similar to the K2 except for the adoption of yet another powerplant, the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW206 engine. By 2008, according to AgustaWestland, the A109 Power was being operated across 46 countries. In 2006, an enlarged variant, the &quot;A109S Grand&quot;, was introduced.

The A109 was renamed the &quot;AW109&quot; as a consequence of the July 2000 merger of Finmeccanica and GKN plc&#x27;s respective helicopter subsidiaries Agusta and Westland Helicopters to form AgustaWestland. Since the mid-1990s, fuselages for the AW109 have been manufactured by PZL-Świdnik, which became a subsidiary company of AgustaWestland in 2010. In June 2006, the 500th fuselage was delivered by the Polish aerospace company PZL-Świdnik, marking 10 years of co-operation on the AW109 between the two companies. In 2004, AgustaWestland formed a joint venture with the Changhe Aircraft Industries Corporation for the support and production of the AW109 in China; by 2009, the joint venture was reportedly capable of performing the final assembly of the AW109 in addition to independently manufacturing major sections, such as the fuselage.

In February 2014, AgustaWestland announced the development of the AW109 Trekker, an updated model. It is equipped with skid landing gear (being the first twin-engine helicopter produced by the company to have this feature) and is powered by a pair of FADEC-equipped Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW207C engines; its avionics are supplied by Genesys Aerospace, which have been designed for single-pilot operations. The Trekker reportedly expands upon the utility capabilities of the standard AW109. Akin to the prior models, the final assembly of the AW109 Trekker is undertaken at sites in both the US and Italy.

==Design==

The AW109 is a lightweight twin-engine helicopter, known for its speed, elegant appearance and ease of control. Since entering commercial service, several revisions and iterations have been made, frequently introducing new avionics and engine technologies. AgustaWestland have promoted the type for its multirole capabilities and serviceability. The type has proven highly popular with VIP/corporate customers; according to AgustaWestland, 50% of all of the AW109 Power variant had been sold in such configurations. Other roles for the AW109 have included emergency medical services, law enforcement, homeland security missions, harbor pilot shuttle duty, search and rescue, maritime operations, and military uses. In 2008, AgustaWestland claimed the AW109 to be &quot;one of the industry’s best-selling helicopters&quot;.

A range of turboshaft powerplants have been used to power the numerous variants of the AW109, from the original Allison 250-C14 engines to the Turbomeca Arriel 1K1 and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW206 of more modern aircraft. Powerplants can be replaced or swapped for during airframe overhauls, resulting in increasing lifting capacity and other performance changes. In the case of single-engine failure, the AW109 is intended to have a generous power reserve even on a single engine. The engines drive a fully articulated four-blade rotor system. Over time, more advanced rotor blade designs have been progressively adopted for the AW109&#x27;s main and tail rotors, such as composite materials being used to replace bonded metal, these improvements have typically been made with the aim of reducing operating costs and noise signature. According to Rotor&amp;Wing, the type is well regarded for its &quot;high, hot, and heavy&quot; performance.

According to AgustaWestland, the AW109 Power features various advanced avionics systems, these include a three-axis autopilot, an auto-coupled Instrument Landing System, integrated GPS, a Moving Map Display, weather radar, and a Traffic Alerting System. These systems are designed to reduce pilot workload (the AW109 can be flown under single or dual-pilot instrument flight rules (IFR)) and enable the use of night vision goggles (NVG) to conduct day-or-night operations. The AW109 has a forced trim system which can be readily and selectively activated by the controlling pilot using triggers located on the cyclic and collective which hold the control inputs at the last set position if activated. All critical systems are deliberately redundant for fail-safe operations; the hydraulic system, hydraulic actuators, and electrical system are all dual-redundant, while the power inverters are triple-redundant. The AW109 also has reduced maintenance requirements due to an emphasis on reliability across the range of components used.

Some models of the AW109 feature the &quot;quick convertible interior&quot;, a cabin configuration designed to be flexibly re-configured to allow the rotorcraft to be quickly adapted for different roles, such as the installation or removal of mission consoles or medical stretchers. Mission-specific equipment can also be installed in the externally accessible separate baggage compartment, which can be optionally expanded. Optional cabin equipment includes soundproofing, air conditioning, and bleed air heating. Aftermarket cabin configurations are offered by third parties; Pininfarina and Versace have both offered designer interiors for the AW109, while Aerolite Max Bucher has developed a lightweight emergency medical service interior. The majority of AW109s are fitted with a retractable wheeled tricycle undercarriage, providing greater comfort than skids and taxiing capability. For shipboard operations, the wheeled landing gear is reinforced, deck mooring points are fixed across the lower fuselage, and extensive corrosion protection is typically applied.

Optional mission equipment for the AW109 has included dual controls, a rotor brake, windshield wipers, a fixed cargo hook, snow skis, external loudspeakers, wire-strike protection system, engine particle separator, engine compartment fire extinguishers, datalink, and rappelling fittings. A range of armaments can be installed upon the AW109, including pintle-mounted machine guns, machine gun pods, 20mm cannons, rocket pods, anti-tank missiles and air-to-air missiles. Those AW109s operated by the U.S. Coast Guard, later designated as &quot;MH-68A&quot;, had the following equipment installed: a rescue hoist, emergency floats, FLIR, Spectrolab NightSun search light, a 7.62 mm M240D machine gun and a Barrett M107 semi-automatic 12.7 mm (.50 caliber) anti-material rifle with laser sight.

==Operational history==

Various branches of the Italian military have operated variants of the AW109; the Guardia di Finanza has operated its own variant of the AW109 since the 1980s for border patrol and customs duties, by 2010, it was in the process of replacing its original AW109s with a new-generation of AW109s.

During 1982, the Argentine Army Aviation deployed three A109As to the Falkland Islands during the Falklands War. They operated with the helicopter fleet (9 UH-1H, 2 CH-47C and 2 Pumas) in reconnaissance and liaison roles. One of the helicopters was destroyed on the ground by a British Harrier attack; the others were captured and sent to Europe aboard HMS Fearless. The British Army Air Corps decided to use those helicopters in domestic operations (being flown by 8 Flight AAC to support SAS regiment deployments in the UK), alongside two additional A109 which were purchased later following favorable use of the first two; all were retired in 2009. The improved AW109E and SP – GrandNew versions have also been operated by No. 32 Squadron of the Royal Air Force to transport members of the British Royal Family.

In 1988, 46 A109s were sold to the Belgian Armed Forces; it was later alleged that Agusta had given the Flemish Socialist Party over 50 million Belgian francs as a bribe to secure the sale. The resulting scandal led to the resignation and later conviction of NATO Secretary General Willy Claes. Belgium has operated an A109 aerial display team. In early 2013, a pair of Belgian AW109s were deployed to Sévaré, Mali, to perform medical evacuation mission in support of the French-led Operation Serval. In June 2013, Belgian newspaper &quot;La Libre Belgique&quot; alleged that several former Belgian military helicopters had been sold via a private company to South Sudan in violation of a European Union embargo on weapons sales.
During the 1990s, the US Coast Guard, seeking to tackle drug trafficking on small speed boats via armed aerial interdiction helicopters, evaluated several options and selected the AW109 as the winner. For a number of years, eight armed AW109s, designated &quot;MH-68A Sting Ray&quot;, were leased from AgustaWestland and deployed at Coast Guard land facilities and onboard cutters. Positive experience with the AW109 led to the Coast Guard deciding to arm all of its helicopters and, following adaptions of their existing assets, the AW109s were returned after the lease expired.

In September 1999, the South African Air Force (SAAF) placed an order for 30 AW109s; 25 of the 30 rotorcraft were assembled locally by Denel Aviation, starting in 2003. As many as 16 SAAF AW109s were deployed for patrol, utility, and medical evacuation missions during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In July 2013, the SAAF reported that 18 AW109s had effectively been grounded due to lack of funding, these rotorcraft being only occasionally activated but not conducting flights; in 2013, only 71 flight hours were allocated to the whole AW109 fleet. The type may be reduced to flying VIPs rather than being operationally capable; South Africa is also considering selling a number of AW109s, and may cease helicopter operations altogether.

In 2001, 20 AW109s were ordered for the Swedish Armed Forces, receiving the Swedish military designation of &quot;Hkp 15&quot;. In 2010, it was reported that considerable demands were being placed upon the AW109 fleet, in part due to the delayed delivery of the NHIndustries NH90. In early 2015, a pair of Swedish AW109s were deployed on board the Royal Netherlands Navy ship HNLMS &quot;Johan de Witt&quot;, their first-ever deployment on board a foreign vessel, in support of a multinational anti-piracy mission off the coast of Somalia; the AW109 reportedly achieve a 100% availability rate over the course of three months.

Between 2007 and 2012, three AW109E Power helicopters were operated under lease by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) to train naval aircrew.

In May 2008, the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) placed an order for five AW109LUH rotorcraft to replace their aging Bell 47 Sioux in a training capacity; they are also used in the utility role to complement the larger NHIndustries NH90 and has seen limited use in VIP missions.

During August 2008, Scott Kasprowicz and Steve Sheik broke the round-the-world speed record using a factory-standard AgustaWestland AW109S Grand, with a time of 11 days, 7 hours and 2 minutes. The AW109S Grand is also recorded as being the fastest helicopter from New York to Los Angeles.
In 2013, the Philippine Air Force (PAF) and the Philippine Navy independently ordered batches of AW109 Power rotorcraft; additional AW109s were ordered in 2014. The PAF AW109s are used as armed gunships, while both armed and unarmed AW109s are operated by the Philippine Navy. During the Battle of Marawi, multiple PAF AW109s engaged in combat the ISIS-affiliated Maute Group. During November 2020, a PAF AW109 was involved in a joint operation of Armed Forces of the Philippines Joint Task Force (JTF) - Sulu against Abu Sayyaf kidnappers in northern Mindanao, firing upon a boat in conjunction with strafing fire from Philippine Navy Multipurpose Assault Craft.

<doc id="510273" wikidata="Q932991" url="?curid=510273" title="Minister for Labour (Ireland)">
<text>The Minister for Labour () was originally a position in the Government of the Irish Republic, the self-declared state which was established in 1919 by Dáil Éireann, the parliamentary assembly made up of the majority of Irish MPs elected in the 1918 general election. Constance Markievicz was the first person to hold the post. The office did not continue into the Executive Council of the Irish Free State.

The later office of Minister for Labour was created by the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1966 as a member of the Government of Ireland.

In 1993, the minister&#x27;s functions were transferred to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and was succeeded by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, a position which existed during the Fianna Fáil–Labour coalition led by Albert Reynolds (1993–1994) and the Fine Gael–Labour–Democratic Left coalition (1994–1997) led by John Bruton. Its primary functions were in the area of civil and family law reform (including divorce legislation) and equality legislation. Under both governments, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform was Labour Party TD Mervyn Taylor, although Máire Geoghegan-Quinn served as Minister between November and December 1994, after Labour had left the coalition with Fianna Fáil.

In 1997, the minister&#x27;s functions were transferred to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Department of Equality and Law Reform ceased to exist but was not formally abolished. The functions formerly exercised by the Minister for Labour are now exercised by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The functions formerly exercised by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform are now exercised by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Minister for Justice.

<doc id="510275" wikidata="Q557018" url="?curid=510275" title="Ken Kutaragi">
<text>is a Japanese engineering technologist and businessman, currently president and CEO of Cyber AI Entertainment. Formerly the chairman and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE), the video game division of Sony, Kutaragi is known as &quot;The Father of the PlayStation&quot; having overseen the development of the original console and its successors and spinoffs until departing the company in 2007, shortly after the PlayStation 3 was released.

Kutaragi had also designed the sound processor for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. With Sony, he designed the VLSI chip, which works in conjunction with the PS1&#x27;s RISC CPU to handle the graphics rendering.

==Early years==
Kutaragi was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1950. His parents, although not wealthy by Japanese standards, still managed to own their own business, a small printing plant in the city. As Kutaragi grew into childhood, they actively encouraged the young boy to explore his mechanical abilities in the plant, and he worked after school there. Aside from his duties in his parents&#x27; factory, Kutaragi was a studious, high-level student.

Kutaragi always had the desire to &quot;tinker&quot;, often taking apart toys as a child rather than playing with them. This curiosity carried from childhood, leading him as a teenager to learn the intricacies of electronics. Eventually, in fact, his love of electronics led to him enrolling in University of Electro-Communications, where he acquired an Electronics degree in the 1970s.

Immediately after graduation, Kutaragi began working for Sony in their digital research labs in the mid-1970s. Although at the time it was considered a radical decision, Kutaragi felt that Sony was on the &quot;fast track&quot;. He quickly gained a reputation as an excellent problem solver and a forward-thinking engineer, earning that reputation by working on many successful projects, including early liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and digital cameras.

==Career==
In 1983, he was watching his two-year-old son play a Famicom and realized the potential that existed within video games. At that particular time, Sony&#x27;s executives had no interest in video games. Thus, when Nintendo expressed the need for a sound chip for its upcoming new 16-bit system, Kutaragi accepted the offer. Working in secret, he designed the chip, the SPC700. When they found out, Sony&#x27;s executives were furious. Only with Sony CEO Norio Ohga&#x27;s approval was Kutaragi able to complete the chip and keep his job.

Even while working with Nintendo, within Sony, gaming was still regarded as a fad. Despite this hostile atmosphere to video games, Kutaragi managed to persuade Ohga into working with Nintendo to develop a CD-ROM add-on for the Super NES that would be released alongside a Sony branded console that could play both Super NES cartridges and CD games. These efforts resulted in a device called the &quot;Play Station&quot;. Eventually, the partnership between Sony and Nintendo faltered due to licensing disagreements, but Kutaragi and Sony continued to develop their own console. He wanted to utilize Sony&#x27;s access to the latest technology in creating the most powerful home console available, unlike Nintendo, which used primitive, outdated technology to create their consoles. He also noticed that Nintendo focused mainly on children, so he wanted Sony&#x27;s console to target older adult gamers, as he felt it was a market not yet tapped by any of the available home consoles. Kutaragi later recalled staying up all night working on the console design for several nights in a row &quot;because our work was so interesting.&quot; Despite being considered a risky gamble by other Sony executives, Kutaragi once again had the support of Ohga and several years later the company released the original PlayStation. The success of the PlayStation led to him heading up the development of successor consoles, the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3.

The commercial success of the PlayStation franchise makes Sony Computer Entertainment the most profitable business division of Sony. Despite being an upstart in the console market against veterans Nintendo and Sega, the first PlayStation displaced them both to become the most popular console of that era. The PlayStation 2 extended Sony&#x27;s lead in the following generation, at one point holding a 65% market share with 100 million units shipped. Kutaragi was recognized by many financial and technological publications for this success, most notably when he was named one of the 100 most influential people of 2004 in TIME magazine and the &quot;Gutenberg of Video Games&quot;.

In 1997 Kutaragi was appointed CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America, and accordingly moved to California. Since 1997, Kutaragi had been favoured to become the next Sony president. He enjoyed a close relationship with Ohga. Ohga&#x27;s successor Nobuyuki Idei promoted Kutaragi to Deputy Executive President, Sony-Global chief operating officer, and Vice-Chairman in 2003.

On 30 November 2006, Kutaragi was replaced as president of Sony Computer Entertainment by Kazuo Hirai, the President of SCE America. In addition to other management changes, Kutaragi was promoted to chairman of SCEI, and retained his position as chief executive officer of the group. On 26 April 2007, it was announced that Kutaragi would retire and instead take up the role of Honorary Chairman. Taking over his position would be then Hirai, who would eventually be promoted to president and CEO of Sony. On 29 June 2011, following the reshuffling of management, Sony announced that on 28 June 2011, Kutaragi had stepped down as honorary chairman of SCEI. Kutaragi relinquished active management of the business he created and built in 2007, when he stepped down as executive chairman and group CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment. He has remained at Sony as senior technology advisor.

Ken Kutaragi later became president and CEO of Cyber AI Entertainment, Inc. He also serves on the boards of Kadokawa Group Holdings, Inc., Nojima Corporation, and Rakuten, Inc. In 2009, he became a visiting professor of Ritsumeikan University. In 2020, Kutaragi became CEO of Tokyo-based AI and robotics startup Ascent Robotics, after serving on its Board of Directors since 2018.

===Assessment by industry analysts===
Although Kutaragi&#x27;s leadership of consumer electronics was not successful, analysts also suspect that outgoing Sony CEO Nobuyuki Idei had set up Kutaragi to fail, given that both men had a cool working relationship. Idei assigned Kutaragi the tedious task of turning around the consumer division, which had already been falling behind competitors such as Samsung in the LCD market. Kutaragi&#x27;s rival for the top position, Howard Stringer, was given the less difficult assignment of the content business and his success at Sony BMG Music Entertainment resulted in his promotion.

Sony Interactive Entertainment, which Kutaragi had been heading since its inception, had a weaker year in 2004 after several years of solid growth. During that same year, Sony&#x27;s game sales fell to $7.5 billion from $8.2 billion, and its operating income slid to $650 million from $1 billion, losing $25 million in Q4 of 2004. This can be attributed partially to the over-saturation of the video game market and price wars that caused the PS2 to lose the top sales position for a time.

=== Seventh generation game consoles ===
Kutaragi has labelled the Xbox 360 as &quot;just an Xbox 1.5&quot; and stated that it was &quot;only going after PlayStation 2&quot;. However, SCE Executive Tetsuhiko Yasuda did not consider Microsoft to be a competitor, and has said that they might consider working on games together. In September 2006 Kutaragi admitted that the shortage of PlayStation 3 consoles to North America and Japan as well as the postponing of the console&#x27;s debut in Europe put Sony&#x27;s strength in hardware in decline.

<text>Simcoe County is a county and census division located in the central region of Ontario, Canada. The county is located north of the Greater Toronto Area, and forms the north western edge of the Golden Horseshoe. The county seat is located in Midhurst. The cities of Barrie and Orillia are geographically within Simcoe County, but are both politically independent single-tier municipalities.

==Geography==
Simcoe County stretches from the shores of Lake Simcoe in the east to Georgian Bay in the west. The land area of the county is . The Niagara Escarpment runs through sections of the western part of the county, and the Minesing Wetlands, a Ramsar Convention &quot;Wetland of International Importance&quot;, is located in the centre of the county.

Simcoe County is informally split into two subregions, “South Simcoe” and “North Simcoe”. The dividing line between these two areas is Simcoe County Road 90 (Mill St.).

South Simcoe municipalities are situated at the northern boundary of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and therefore generally have a closer socio-economic association with the GTA. South Simcoe is also within the Toronto commuter belt as it is home to a relatively high proportion of people commuting to the GTA. South Simcoe is home to five municipalities, including: the Town of Innisfil, the Township of Adjala-Tosorontio, the Town of Bradford West Gwillimbury, the Township of Essa and the Town of New Tecumseth (which includes: Alliston, Beeton and Tottenham).

North Simcoe is less connected to the GTA due to its more removed geographic location, is generally less industrial than South Simcoe, and generally has a closer socio-economic association with the Muskoka area, located immediately north. However, North Simcoe hosts two GO Transit train stations that provide daily commuter rail service to Toronto. North Simcoe includes the Township of Clearview, the Township of Oro-Medonte, the Township of Ramara, the Township of Severn, the Township of Springwater, the Township of Tay and the Township of Tiny, the Town of Collingwood, the Town of Midland, the Town of Penetanguishene and the Town of Wasaga Beach. The cities of Barrie and Orillia are geographically within North Simcoe, but both are politically independent single-tier municipalities.

==History==
Simcoe County, in particular the former Wendake area near Nottawasaga Bay, was the site of the earliest French exploration and settlement of Ontario; they were the first Europeans in the area. Several historic sites, including Carhagouha and Sainte-Marie among the Hurons, mark the earliest known contacts between the area&#x27;s traditional Huron population and French missionaries. The Huron capital, Ossossané, was at one time the largest aboriginal settlement in all of North America outside Mexico.

The County, named by Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada John Graves Simcoe in honour of his father Captain John Simcoe, was established as part of the Home District in 1798 by the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada. Its initial territory was described as follows:

At its beginning, the County existed only for purposes of military enlistment. In 1823, it became a separate constituency for elections to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada, but, as eligibility to vote was dependent upon having title to property, and Simcoe&#x27;s first registrar of deeds was not appointed until 1826, it did not send a separate member to the Assembly until the election of John Cawthra in 1828. It was withdrawn from the Home District in 1837, with its territory divided as follows:

Between 1837 and 1841 several acts were passed by the Legislature of Upper Canada which set apart Simcoe District. These acts named the townships that the County would encompass and authorized the levying of taxes for the purpose of constructing a jail and court house. On January 11, 1843, the jail and court house having been duly erected, the Governor General proclaimed the County of Simcoe to be a separate and distinct District. The province of Canada also appointed James R. Gowan as the first judge of the District of Simcoe.

The District was restructured in 1845, changing its composition to the following 24 townships:
* Adjala
* Artemesia
* Collingwood
* Essa
* Flos
* West Gwillimbury
* Innisfil
* Medonte
* Matchedash
* Mulmur
* Mono
* Nottawasaga
* Osprey
* Oro
* North Orillia
* South Orillia
* Saint Vincent
* Sunnidale
* Tay
* Tecumseth
* Tosorontio
* Tiny
* Uphrasia &quot;(sic)&quot;
* Vespra
Effective January 1, 1850, Simcoe District was abolished, and Simcoe County was organized for municipal purposes.

Between 1845 and 1851, there had been a campaign to have the part of West Gwillimbury south of the Holland River annexed to York County. The County Council finally agreed to this action in 1851, subject to arbitration as to the division of liabilities. It was implemented by an Act of the Parliament of the Province of Canada later that year.

On January 1, 1852, after transferring its five western townships to Grey County, the County was defined as including the following townships:
* Adjala
* Essa
* Flos
* Gwillimbury West
* Innisfil
* Matchedash
* Medonte
* Mono
* Mulmur
* Nottawasaga
* Orillia
* Oro
* Sunnidale
* Tay
* Tecumseth
* Tiny
* Tossorontio &quot;(sic)&quot;
* Vespra
Together with the unorganized territory bounded to the north by the French River, to the south by the Severn River and Rama Township, to the west by Lake Huron and to the east by the former boundary between the Home District and the Newcastle District as extended to the French River.

The unorganized territory, some of which had been surveyed into townships, together with parts of Victoria County and Nipissing District, was withdrawn in 1868-1869 to form the new District of Muskoka and District of Parry Sound. However, any municipalities established in them still formed part of the original counties for municipal purposes, and they were still responsible for the administration of justice, which proved to be problematic. The portions of the districts that were not part of Simcoe County were transferred to it in 1877. This lasted until 1888, when the territory contained within the districts was separated from Simcoe County.

Mono and Mulmur Townships were withdrawn from Simcoe County in 1881 and transferred to the newly formed Dufferin County.

Mara and Rama Townships were transferred to Simcoe County following the dissolution of Ontario County in 1974.

===Restructuring (1994)===
In 1994, the County was restructured into 16 local municipalities:
* Town of Bradford West Gwillimbury
* Town of Collingwood
* Town of Innisfil
* Town of Midland
* Town of New Tecumseth
* Town of Penetanguishene
* Town of Wasaga Beach
* Township of Adjala–Tosorontio
* Township of Clearview
* Township of Essa
* Township of Oro-Medonte
* Township of Ramara
* Township of Severn
* Township of Springwater
* Township of Tay
* Township of Tiny

The local, or &quot;lower tier&quot; municipalities are responsible for water and sewer services, local roads, public libraries, recreation services, fire and police services, land use development control and licensing and permitting services.

The cities of Barrie and Orillia, although separate politically and administratively from the County, are geographically and economically part of the County and send elected representatives to serve on County committees which provide services to the residents of the cities, including paramedic services, long term care facilities, social services, social housing, archives and Museum. They are counted within the census division.

County Council is composed of the mayors and deputy mayors of each of the sixteen towns and townships which comprise the County of Simcoe. The head of County Council is called the Warden and is elected for a one-year term by the council members at the Inaugural Meeting, held each December.

Though once a consideration according to the &quot;Wasaga Sun&quot;, Simcoe County has elected not to restructure itself as a regional municipality.

<text>Infineon Technologies AG is Germany&#x27;s largest semiconductor manufacturer. The company was spun-off from Siemens AG in 1999. Infineon has about 58,600 employees in 2023 and is one of the ten largest semiconductor manufacturers worldwide. In 2023 the company achieved sales of €16.309 billion.

== Markets ==
Infineon markets semiconductors and systems for automotive, industrial, and multimarket sectors, as well as chip card and security products. Infineon has subsidiaries in the US in Milpitas, California, and in the Asia-Pacific region, in Singapore and Tokyo, Japan.

Infineon has a number of facilities in Europe, one in Dresden. Infineon&#x27;s high power segment is in Warstein, Germany; Villach, Graz and Linz in Austria; Cegléd in Hungary; and Italy. It also runs R&amp;D centers in France, Singapore, Romania, Taiwan, UK, Ukraine and India, as well as fabrication units in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, China and Hungary. There is also a Shared Service Center in Porto, Portugal.

Infineon is listed in the DAX index of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

In 2010, board member Klaus Wucherer was elected to step into the chairman&#x27;s office upon the retirement of the then-current chairman Max Dietrich Kley following a proxy contest in advance of the shareholders&#x27; meeting.

In 2023, it was Germany&#x27;s largest chip manufacturer.

As of 2011, Infineon comprised four business areas after several restructurings:

=== Automotive (ATV)===
Infineon provides semiconductor products for use in powertrains (engine and transmission control), comfort electronics (e.g., steering, shock absorbers, air conditioning), as well as in safety systems (ABS, airbags, ESP). The product portfolio includes microcontrollers, power semiconductors and sensors. In the fiscal year 2018 (ending September), sales amounted to €3,284 million for the ATV segment.

=== Green Industrial Power (GIP) ===
The industrial division of the company (named IPC until 2023 ) includes power semiconductors and modules which are used for generation, transmission and consumption of electrical energy. Its application areas include control of electric drives for industrial applications and household appliances, modules for renewable energy production, conversion and transmission. This segment achieved sales of €1,323 million in fiscal year 2018.

=== Power &amp; Sensor Systems (PSS) ===
The division Power &amp; Sensor Systems sums up the business with semiconductor components for efficient power management or high-frequency applications. Those find application in lighting management systems and LED lighting, power supplies for servers, PCs, notebooks and consumer electronics, custom devices for peripheral devices, game consoles, applications in medical technology, high-frequency components having a protective function for communication and tuner systems and silicon MEMS microphones. In the fiscal year 2018, PSS generated €2,318 million.

=== Connected Secure Systems (CSS) ===
The CSS business provides microcontrollers for mobile phone SIM cards, payment cards, security chips and chips for passports, identity cards and other official documents. Infineon delivers a significant number of chips for the new German identity card. CSS achieved €664 million in fiscal year 2018. &quot;Infineon is the number 1 in embedded security&quot; (IHS, 2016 – IHS Embedded Digital Security Report).

== Acquisitions and divestitures ==
Infineon bought the Taiwanese chip designer ADMtek in 2004. In 2006, the former Memory Products division was carved out as Infineon&#x27;s subsidiary Qimonda AG, of which Infineon last held a little over three-quarters. At its height Qimonda employed about 13,500 people; it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange until it filed for bankruptcy with the district court in Munich in January 2009. 

When Infineon sold Wireline Communications in July 2009 to Golden Gate Capital for €250 million, the resulting company was named Lantiq. With around 1,000 employees, Lantiq was acquired by Intel for US$345 million in 2015. Infineon&#x27;s wireless business segment was sold to Intel in January 2011 for US$1.4 billion, with the resulting new company named Intel Mobile Communications (IMC). IMC had approximately 3,500 employees. The smartphone modem business of IMC was acquired by Apple Inc. in 2019.

In August 2014 Infineon Technologies agreed to buy the International Rectifier Corporation (IR) for about US$3 billion, one third by cash and two-thirds by credit line. The acquisition was officially closed on January 13, 2015. In July 2016, Infineon agreed to buy the North Carolina–based company Wolfspeed from Cree Inc. for US$850 million in cash, although the deal was ultimately stopped due to US security concerns. In October 2016, Infineon acquired the company Innoluce, which has expertise in MEMS and LiDAR systems for use in autonomous cars. The MEMS lidar system can scan up to 5,000 data points a second with a range of 250 meters, with an expected unit cost of $250 in mass production. Infineon Technologies AG sold its RF Power Business Unit in March 2018 to Cree Inc. for €345 million. Infineon announced in June 2019 that it would acquire Cypress Semiconductors for US$9.4 billion. The acquisition closed on 17 April of 2020.
In May 2023, Infineon acquired &quot;tiny machine learning&quot; company Imagimob, a Stockholm, Sweden–based company with a platform for development and deployment of AI applications. Infineon acquired GaN Systems, headquartered in Ottawa, Canada, in October 2023. Infineon in 2023 acted on an expansion plan by investing EUR 5 billion into its semiconductor fab in Kulim, Kedah, Malaysia. As of 2023 Infineon was also planning to build two additional plants in Dresden for €5 billion, asking the government to subsidize it with €1 billion, financed through the €4 billion European Chips Act. It would employ 3000 people.

== Financial data ==
== Management ==
In 2019 the following persons were in the following positions:

* Jochen Hanebeck (CEO)
* Andreas Urschitz (CMO)
* Rutger Wijburg (COO)
* Elke Reichart (CDSO)
* Sven Schneider (CFO)

==Litigation==
In 2004–2005, an investigation was carried out into a DRAM price fixing conspiracy during 1999–2002 that damaged competition and raised PC prices. As a result, Samsung paid a $300 million fine, Hynix paid $185 million, Infineon $160 million.

==Security flaw==

In October 2017, it was reported that a flaw, dubbed ROCA, in a code library developed by Infineon, which had been in widespread use in security products such as smartcards and TPMs, enabled private keys to be inferred from public keys. As a result, all systems depending upon the privacy of such keys were vulnerable to compromise, such as identity theft or spoofing. Affected systems include 750,000 Estonian national ID cards, 300,000 Slovak national ID cards, and computers that use Microsoft BitLocker drive encryption in conjunction with an affected TPM. Microsoft released a patch that works around the flaw via Windows Update immediately after the disclosure.

<text>The New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University (NYSCC) is a statutory college of the State University of New York located on the campus of Alfred University, Alfred, New York. There are a total of 616 students, including 536 undergraduates and 80 graduates.

==History==
The college was founded by an act signed into law on April 11, 1900, by Governor Theodore Roosevelt, establishing the New York State School of Clay-Working and Ceramics. This move by Alfred University to petition the New York State legislature in 1899 followed a period of crisis at the university starting in 1895, which was facing low enrollments, mounting deficits, and the recent resignation of then-president A.E. Main (1893-95). The trustees, with support from area businesses and alumni, recognized the trends in higher education toward applied sciences and technology and supported the decision to petition the legislature.

Charles Fergus Binns, a British ceramist, served as the first director of the school, after completing a career at Royal Worcester Porcelain Works. In 1932 it was renamed the New York State College of Ceramics (NYSCC) with two departments, General Technology and Engineering and Applied Art. The college is presently composed of the School of Art and Design, the Inamori School of Engineering and the Samuel R. Scholes Library. The college also houses the Inamori Museum of Fine Ceramics, one of two such collections in the world focused on technical ceramics and glass.

The Inamori School of Engineering at Alfred University offers programs in ceramics, glass, biomaterials, and materials science engineering. In addition, the programs in mechanical engineering and renewable energy engineering are offered through Alfred University, the private institution with which the NYSCC is affiliated. The School of Engineering is one of only two institutions in the U.S. that offers a B.S. in Ceramic Engineering and the only institution in the U.S. that offers degrees in glass science.

<doc id="510282" wikidata="Q1457831" url="?curid=510282" title="Steps (pop group)">
<text>Steps are a British dance-pop group consisting of Lee Latchford-Evans, Claire Richards, Lisa Scott-Lee, Faye Tozer and Ian &quot;H&quot; Watkins. They were formed in May 1997 and achieved two number-one albums in the UK, 14 consecutive UK top-5 singles including two number ones (one a double A-side). The group has sold over 22 million records worldwide, 15 million albums worldwide. In-addition to earning a BRIT Award nomination in 1999, for Best Newcomer, the group would be an opening support act for Britney Spears on her debut American tour the same year. When Richards and Watkins departed to form a recording duo, the group disbanded, on 26 December 2001 (officially). Their penultimate single reached No. 5 on the UK charts, while their final album of greatest hits, &quot;&quot; (2001), was the group&#x27;s second No. 1 album in the UK.

Steps re-formed in May 2011 for a four-part Sky Living documentary series titled &quot;Steps: Reunion&quot;. The series started airing on 28 September, following an announcement of a second greatest-hits album, &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot;, released on 10 October 2011. The album debuted at No. 1, becoming the band&#x27;s third album to top the British charts. The second series of &quot;Steps: Reunion&quot;, titled &quot;Steps: On the Road Again&quot;, aired on Sky Living in April 2012; the series followed the band as they embarked on their sellout, 22-date UK tour. On 24 September 2012, the group confirmed they would release their fourth studio album, &quot;Light Up The World&quot;, on 12 November 2012, alongside a six-date Christmas tour, starting on 30 November and ending on 5 December. The group re-formed for a second time on 1 January 2017 in celebration of their 20th anniversary, and later announced their fifth studio album, &quot;Tears on the Dancefloor&quot;, which was released in April 2017.

Steps&#x27; sixth studio album, &quot;What the Future Holds&quot;, was released on 27 November 2020. It was preceded by three singles, the title song &quot;What the Future Holds&quot;, &quot;Something in Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;To the Beat of My Heart&quot;. Their seventh studio album, &quot;What the Future Holds Pt. 2&quot;, with 10 new tracks, four stripped-back versions of songs and a new sound for some tracks, was released in 2021. The band&#x27;s third compilation album, &quot;Platinum Collection&quot; was released in August 2022, and debuted at number 1 in the UK, making Steps the first British, mixed-gender group to achieve four number 1 albums in four different decades.

According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Steps has been certified for sales of 5 million albums and 4.8 million singles in the UK.

==History==
===1997–1999: Formation, commercial success and &quot;Step One&quot;===
Steps were formed by Steve Crosby and Barry Upton (writers of &quot;5,6,7,8&quot;) alongside manager Tim Byrne after auditioning hopefuls who answered an ad in &quot;The Stage&quot; newspaper. Byrne had previously been involved in the production of the Smash Hits Poll Winners Party, the BBC collaboration with the pop magazine &quot;Smash Hits&quot;.

After auditions, the original line-up of Watkins, Scott-Lee, Derek O&#x27;Brien, Maddy Chan, and Mitch Stevens was finalised and the band started shooting promotional images and recording tracks. However, O&#x27;Brien, Chan and Stevens left, as they wanted more than a one-hit wonder, and saw no long-term future with Steps. New auditions were held on 7 May 1997, and in conjunction with the manufacturers, they selected Faye Tozer, Lee Latchford-Evans and Claire Richards as the remaining members.

The group&#x27;s name came from a marketing plan: The dance steps for each of the quintet&#x27;s choreographed music videos would be included with their singles.

Their first single &quot;5,6,7,8&quot; was a techno line dance song. Though not typical of what became their style, it was their first hit both in the UK and internationally. Despite only peaking at number 14, the single achieved considerable longevity in the fast-paced singles climate of 1997–1998, racking up over four months on the UK chart. The track remains one of the highest-selling singles never to reach the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart. Its release in Australia gave the group their first number one in 1998.

Tim Byrne then founded a management and production company, Byrne Blood, with former BMG head of marketing and video, Victoria Blood, which took over sole management of Steps and was also instrumental in the creation and management of A1.

The group were then presented to pop impresario, Pete Waterman who signed them to his Eastern Block Unity Label (EBUL) in a partnership with his long time associates, Jive Records. Waterman and his new PWL production partners, Mark Topham and Karl Twigg, reworked the &quot;5,6,7,8&quot; demo, introducing the prominent fiddle into the arrangement. Waterman stated that while he was pleased with the final mix of &quot;5,6,7,8&quot;, his co-producers were less so, to the extent that on the single liner notes they did not take a credit, although they were credited on all subsequent releases, such as the &quot;Step One&quot; album. In April 1998, Steps launched their second single, a cover version of Bananarama&#x27;s &quot;Last Thing on My Mind&quot;, which became their first UK top ten, peaking at number 6.

By August 1998, Steps continued to build momentum with their third single &quot;One for Sorrow&quot; which peaked at number 2, and began an unbroken chain of 14 consecutive Top 5 hits on the UK singles chart. Steps&#x27; singles success translated into album sales, with their debut album &quot;Step One&quot; entering the UK Albums Chart at number 2. It was certified 5× Platinum following a run of 50 weeks in the Top 20.

The next single release was a double A-side which provided Steps with their signature song and biggest career seller. The single was a cover version of the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Tragedy&quot; and original track &quot;Heartbeat&quot;. The single was released in November 1998, when it charted at number 2. Following enduring popularity over the Christmas period, the single rebounded up the chart and became their first number-one hit in January 1999. The final track to be released from &quot;Step One&quot; was &quot;Better Best Forgotten&quot;. Because of the continued success of the previous single, the CD release was delayed by nearly two months. Nonetheless, &quot;Better Best Forgotten&quot; entered the chart at number 2.

Steps were part of the ensemble that released &quot;Thank ABBA for the Music&quot; (a medley of ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Take a Chance on Me&quot;, &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;, &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; and &quot;Thank You for the Music&quot;) in March 1999, as performed at the Brit Awards 1999. The other artists singing were Tina Cousins, Cleopatra, B*Witched, and Billie, known collectively as the Supertroupers. The single later peaked at number four. The group was also nominated for Best British Newcomer. Pete Waterman claimed to have been told days before the ceremony that Steps had won the award, as voted for by listeners of BBC Radio 1. However, on the night the award was handed to the Scottish band Belle &amp; Sebastian, who were assumed to be rank outsiders. Despite the allegation that a significant number of votes for Belle &amp; Sebastian were traced to the University of Strathclyde campus, the band held onto their award as foul play was denied by organizers of the Brit Awards.

=== 1999–2000: &quot;Steptacular&quot;, International tour and &quot;Buzz&quot; ===
In July 1999, Steps released the first single from an all-new album, &quot;Love&#x27;s Got a Hold on My Heart&quot;. Once again they narrowly missed the number-one spot following a last-minute surge by Ricky Martin&#x27;s &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot;. After the single&#x27;s release, Steps went to America to support Britney Spears on her 1999 ...Baby One More Time Tour. A remixed version of &quot;One for Sorrow&quot; was included in the film &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot; and released as their debut American single. They were also successful in Europe and Australasia.

Steps returned home to release their second album, &quot;Steptacular&quot;, which was accompanied by &quot;After the Love Has Gone&quot;. The album charted at number 1 and was eventually certified 4× Platinum, thus becoming their second UK million selling album. The group subsequently released an album in North America which was titled &quot;Step One&quot; and was an amalgamation of their first two albums. The group&#x27;s next two singles, &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be Mine/Better the Devil You Know&quot; and &quot;Deeper Shade of Blue&quot; (originally recorded by labelmate Tina Cousins for her debut album), both continued their top-five run.

In February 2000, Disney Channel aired a concert special featuring Steps and another group, Youngstown, titled &quot;Steps and Youngstown in Concert&quot;. The concert itself promoted the group and the sales of the album.

In July 2000, Steps released another double A-side, consisting of the &quot;Steptacular&quot; track &quot;When I Said Goodbye&quot; and an entirely new song, &quot;Summer of Love&quot;. The latter was a Latino-flavoured pop song, which later appeared on their third album. Steps also won Best Selling Live Act of the year at the Brit Awards 2000.

In October 2000, &quot;Stomp&quot; became their second number one single. The third album, &quot;Buzz&quot;, followed shortly and while it was less successful than their first two albums, went on to achieve double platinum status and contains five UK Top 5 singles. The group worked with many American and Swedish producers who had created hits for other Jive artists such as Britney Spears, &#x27;N Sync, and the Backstreet Boys. The following single, &quot;It&#x27;s the Way You Make Me Feel&quot;, reached number 2 upon its January 2001 release. Steps promoted &quot;Buzz&quot; worldwide and did not return to the UK until May, when they released &quot;Here and Now / You&#x27;ll Be Sorry&quot;.

===2000–2002: &quot;Gold&quot;, group tensions, Watkins&#x27; and Richards&#x27; departure, and split===
Split rumours started circulating after it was announced that Steps would release a greatest hits album. The group continuously denied this in their interviews. &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, a cover of the popular Diana Ross song, was released as the first new single from &quot;&quot;. The single became their biggest in almost two years. The second single, &quot;Words Are Not Enough/I Know Him So Well&quot;, was another top five hit. It would become their final single as a group until their re-formation in 2012.

In 2001, following their Boxing Day split, the group were heavily criticised by their fans. Many UK tabloid papers published the fans&#x27; disgust on their front pages, displaying quotes taken from Steps message boards. After the group spent much of 2001 strongly dismissing claims of a split, fans were furious and accused the group of capitalising on the success of a host of merchandise released in the lucrative pre-Christmas market. However, it has since come to light that both Watkins and Richards left the group on the last night of the Steps&#x27; &quot;Gold: Greatest Hits&quot; tour, because of their ongoing unhappiness within the group, although Steps&#x27; official statement stated that the split was caused by their belief that they should end on a high, while they were at their best and could be remembered for being the best of their kind. H and Claire went on to form a duo in 2002 and signed to Warner Music for a reputed £5 million (over five albums), although they only released one album, &quot;Another You Another Me&quot; same year, before being dropped due to poor album sales.

===2002–2010: &quot;The Last Dance&quot;, Reissue of Steps Classics and solo careers===

Jive released a remix and B-side compilation in 2002. &quot;The Last Dance&quot; featured previously released remixes, B-sides and rarities. The album charted at number 57 without any promotion. A planned release for the track &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; was scrapped in November 2002. However, promotional copies were pressed and a video based upon their live Gold Tour briefly aired on MTV. In the same year, Tozer released her first single , &quot;Someone Like You&quot;, a duet with Russell Watson, which was in the top-10 singles UK 2002. Scott-Lee released &quot;Lately&quot; on 12 May 2003 by Fontana Records and the song was written by Scott-Lee and Point4. The single peaked at number six on the UK Singles Chart, reached number 24 on the Irish Singles Chart, and also charted in the Netherlands and Switzerland. To date, it is Scott-Lee&#x27;s only single to reach the top 10 in the United Kingdom. After then, she released another two singles same year and in 2005 but they didn&#x27;t chart in the top 10 UK. In 2007, BMG reissued a collection of the band&#x27;s first two albums as a 10-year anniversary of the band. Same year, Scott-Lee released her debut album, &quot;Never or Now&quot;. Richards performed &quot;Tragedy&quot; on ITV1 special &quot;Everybody Dance Now&quot; in 2008. This was also Richards&#x27; first public appearance in six years. Watkins played the role of Silly Billy in pantomime &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; at the Southport Theatre from 10 December 2009 to 3 January 2010. Christmas 2010 saw his return to Grimsby as he performed in the pantomime &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, playing the part of Muddles.

===2011–2012: Reunion, &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot; and touring===
Since the band&#x27;s break-up, rumours had been circulating that they would reunite in one form or another. In 2009, Lee Latchford-Evans revealed that the band had been approached to perform a series of concerts. He hinted that a future reunion was possible, but said &quot;it isn&#x27;t the right time right now&quot;.

In early 2011, rumours began circulating that Steps would reunite for a TV series and a one-off concert to mark the tenth anniversary of their 2001 split. The reunion was denied by band&#x27;s members, including Richards on her Twitter page. Richards also announced on 9 July 2011, that a Steps reunion would be &quot;silly&quot;, but she would &quot;never say never&quot;. Contrary to these claims, just 12 days later, it was announced that Steps would be reuniting for a four-part Sky Living documentary, depicting their split and the interim years. The band would also release their greatest hits album &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot;, as well as potential new material.

In a promo for the show each member revealed their true feelings, with Watkins sharing that he regrets the way it all ended but insisting: &quot;If I were to revisit it and turn the clock back, I would probably have done it exactly the same way.&quot; Evans commented: &quot;They took something away from three people that we loved and we didn&#x27;t get a choice because certain people took that choice away from us and I think that is very unfair.&quot; &quot;Steps: Reunion&quot; premiered on Sky Living at 9pm on Wednesday, 28 September.

Steps said in a 2011 interview with Digital Spy that they believed there was a gap in the market for their brand of &quot;happy pop&quot;. Scott-Lee said: &quot;Times have changed, but we are in a recession and Steps&#x27; music was very light-hearted and fun, so there could be a place for that in today&#x27;s society,&quot; &quot;What else is interesting is that there aren&#x27;t any boy/girl pop groups out there at the moment, so there&#x27;s definitely a gap there.&quot;

In the first episode, the group opened up about the tension in the band, with Scott-Lee saying &quot;problems first arose when Watkins started flying in Britney Spears&#x27; private jet while the rest of them travelled by bus.&quot; Before, Richards stated &quot;Further cracks appeared when I discovered that H had been secretly dating the band&#x27;s manager Tim Byrne.&quot; The second episode focused on the band talking about their reasons for the breakdown of communication and friendships in the group and also documented the first time they had all been together in the same room for over a year. The female members then flew to Marbella, Spain to bond while the male members went to Wales. The fourth episode showed Steps discussing the possible future of the band.

Steps&#x27; newly recorded and produced version of &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; (not to be confused with the 1999 version) was added to the track list for &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot;.

On 10 October 2011, Steps appeared for the first time on &quot;This Morning&quot;, performing &quot;It&#x27;s the Way You Make Me Feel&quot; and &quot;Tragedy&quot; and announced their 14-date 2012 arena tour entitled The Ultimate Tour. They also announced that they had re-formed as a band full term. On 14 October 2011, Steps appeared on &quot;Lorraine&quot; and sang &quot;Deeper Shade of Blue&quot;, which they also sang during an appearance on &quot;Loose Women&quot; on 24 October 2011. They then announced they had added 6 performances and removed 2 from the tour, bringing the total to 18 dates; they also announced a new date at the Summer Saturdays at Newmarket Racecourse on 25 August 2012. On 16 October 2011, their new album &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot; went to number one in the UK Albums Chart. Steps performed a medley of their singles, including &quot;Deeper Shade of Blue&quot; and &quot;One for Sorrow&quot;, on 19 November for Children in Need. They also appeared on &quot;Alan Carr: Chatty Man&quot; on 25 December 2011 and performed a medley of &quot;One for Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Deeper Shade of Blue&quot; and &quot;Tragedy&quot;. A DVD of the Reunion tour entitled &quot;Steps – The Ultimate Tour Live&quot; was released on Monday 29 October 2012. It charted at number one on the Official Charts Company&#x27;s Music Video Chart on 4 November 2012.

===2012–2016: &quot;Light Up the World&quot; and hiatus===

It was announced that the group would release their own fragrance called Guilty Pleasure in a disco ball-styled bottle. It was put out to stores on 1 November 2012. They also brought out an official calendar for 2013. It was released on 15 October 2012. On 13 October 2012, Steps without Watkins appeared on BBC Radio 2 with Graham Norton. Their new single &quot;Light Up the World&quot; aired for the very first time. They announced that it would be released on 22 October 2012.

Following their sell-out arena tour, the group performed a number of summer shows and public appearances. At the end of June, Tozer confirmed on Twitter that there would be more from the group after their summer shows. In August, Watkins posted a picture on Twitter confirming the group were in the studio recording. In September, it was confirmed that a new album, titled &quot;Light Up the World&quot;, would be released by the end of the year, consisting of Christmas songs. On 12 November 2012, Steps released &quot;Light Up the World&quot;, their fourth studio album, which consisted of Christmas songs. The lead single from the album, &quot;Light Up the World&quot;, was released on 22 October 2012. The group also embarked on a six-date Christmas tour entitled &quot;Christmas with Steps&quot; in November 2012 through December 2012. In an interview with Metro, Watkins confirmed that there could be two new fragrances for 2013, following the success of Guilty Pleasure. In an interview with Digital Spy, Watkins also confirmed that he would like Rylan Clark to be a support act on their next tour. Tozer appeared on &quot;Loose Women&quot; in February 2013 and when asked about the future of the band she commented saying that they would soon be meeting and discussing what to do next. In March 2013, Watkins announced on Twitter that he and the rest of Steps were having a meeting.

In May 2013, it was announced that Steps were going to be taking a break due to heavily touring last year, confirming on several occasions, after some speculation, that they have not split up. During this hiatus they each pursued solo projects.

Tozer appeared in the worldwide premiere of the musical &quot;The Tailor Made Man&quot; from March to April and appeared in the musical &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; from December through to March. Watkins appeared in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; from June to October and in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; in December. Latchford-Evans ran three marathons and took time out to manage his wife Kerry-Lucy Taylor&#x27;s band Concrete Rose. Richards started her own fashion range for Fashion World, which she also modeled. In January 2014, Richards announced on Twitter that she had begun work on her first studio album. Her album, &quot;My Wildest Dreams&quot;, was released on 1 February 2019.

A new compilation entitled &quot;5,6,7,8: The Collection&quot; was released on 27 November 2015 through Music Club Deluxe containing most of the singles with some B-sides and remixes. This is a budget-release CD which has no official connection to Steps or any previous management or record company but a selection of tracks licensed to Music Club Deluxe for release. The album is available on CD and via download. On 1 April 2016, a three-disc compilation entitled &quot;Stomp All Night: The Remix Anthology&quot; was announced, featuring 36 of the group&#x27;s remixes, 20 of which had never before been released in the UK. The release includes a brand new remix of &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be Mine&quot;.

=== 2017–2021: &quot;Tears on the Dancefloor&quot; and &quot;What the Future Holds Parts 1 &amp; 2&quot; ===
The group officially confirmed on 1 January 2017, that they were ending their five-year break following their reunion tour and Christmas album. The group performed at the I Love The 90&#x27;s event in Hasselt, Belgium, due to the band&#x27;s massive popularity in Belgium during the late 1990s.

The group&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Tears on the Dancefloor&quot;, was released on 21 April 2017 and entered the charts at number 2. On 5 March 2017, the group confirmed the release of the new album, alongside its lead single, &quot;Scared of the Dark&quot;, and a 22-date tour, Party on the Dancefloor. A deluxe edition of the album, titled &quot;Tears on the Dancefloor: Crying at the Disco&quot;, was released on 27 October.

In November 2017, Tozer announced that the reunion was no longer just a 20th-anniversary celebration and that the group intends to continue after their 2018 Summer of Steps tour. In April 2018, Richards announced that following their summer tour, they would begin work on their sixth studio album. In February 2019, Richards announced the group would begin recording their next album during the summer months.

On 7 September 2020, via their social media accounts, Steps announced the release date of their album entitled &quot;What the Future Holds&quot;. The album was released on 27 November of the same year, with pre-orders available from 8 September. The next day, they confirmed a new 14-date UK tour (with special guest Sophie Ellis-Bextor) starting in November 2021. The first single from the album was the Greg Kurstin-and-Sia-penned &quot;What the Future Holds&quot;, released on 9 September 2020. It was followed by &quot;Something in Your Eyes&quot; on 27 October 2020. &quot;To the Beat of My Heart&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single in January 2021.

Steps released a third single from &quot;What the Future Holds Pt. 2&quot; on 20 August 2021, a cover of British pop group Five Star&#x27;s 1987 hit &quot;The Slightest Touch&quot;. On 18 November 2021, Steps released their fourth single, &quot;A Hundred Years of Winter&quot;, written by Darren Hayes. Later that month, the band postponed the last few dates of the tour as two musicians and several crew members had tested positive for COVID-19.

=== 2022–present: 25th anniversary and musical===
Steps announced a string of summer shows to celebrate their 25th anniversary including headlining Mighty Hoopla on 3 June 2022. On 30 May 2022, it was announced the band would release their third official greatest-hits album, titled &quot;Platinum Collection&quot;, which would include 21 tracks including two new tracks. The single &quot;Platinum Megamix&quot; was released on 1 June 2022 and debuted at number 15 on the UK Top 100 Singles Sales Chart on 3 June 2022. On 7 July 2022, Steps released the single &quot;Hard 2 Forget&quot;. The single, a cover of the 2020 Vincint track, debuted on 8 July 2022 at number 21 on the UK Official Singles Download Chart Top 100. &quot;Platinum Collection&quot; was released on 19 August 2022. On 26 August, the album debuted at number 1 on the UK Official Top 100 Albums, and also placed at number 1 on the Official Albums Sales Chart and at number 2 on the Official Vinyl Albums Top 40. Previously unreleased song &quot;The Runner&quot; (cover version of The Three Degrees 1978 song) debuted at number 56 on the UK Official Singles Downloads Chart, despite not being released as an official single.

On 26 January 2024, the group announced &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot;, a stage jukebox musical based on their back catalogue. It will premiere at Birmingham&#x27;s The Alexandra on 9 November 2024 running until 30 November 2024. The group stated &quot;We’ve been lucky to do many things together as a band, but the question we get asked again and again is “where is the Steps musical?&quot; Well…it&#x27;s finally here and we couldn&#x27;t be more excited. On the gala night of the musical, the group announced that the musical will tour the UK and Ireland from August 2025 until May 2026. On 23 February 2024, Steps reissued their first three studio albums, &quot;Step One&quot;, &quot;Steptacular&quot; and &quot;Buzz&quot;, on vinyl record for the first time ever. All three releases debuted in the Top 10 of the UK Vinyl Albums Chart on 1 March 2024. Richards explained that she and her bandmates won&#x27;t be in the musical, only their hit songs. She also stated that Steps will have a little rest before having a bigger comeback soon.

==Filmography==
Steps had their own talent show named &quot;Steps to the Stars&quot;, in which young people performed three acts to be judged by a public vote. It was revealed on the next show who would go through to the final. This was shown on CBBC in 2000/2001. Two series were aired, presented by H and Claire, although the group performed one of its classics at the end of each show. The show featured a young Danny Jones in a band called Y2K in which he played guitar with his sister and their friend, and the eventual winner was a female solo singer called Jenny-Lynn Smith. Also featured were Gareth Gates, before he found fame on &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, and Sean Smith from pop duo Same Difference before he found fame with his singing partner and sister, Sarah Smith, on &quot;The X Factor&quot;.

In 2011, Steps re-formed and appeared in their own reality series called &quot;Steps: Reunion&quot;. It followed them as they rebuilt their friendships following the group&#x27;s acrimonious split in December 2001. Following the huge success of the first series, a second series followed the group on their first arena tour in over ten years, airing in 2012. Both series were aired on Sky Living. Following the series&#x27; success, ITV2 decided to bring back seven pop bands of the late 1990s and early 2000s in a nine-part series: &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;.

<doc id="510291" wikidata="Q4051340" url="?curid=510291" title="The UNIX-HATERS Handbook">
<text>The UNIX-HATERS Handbook is a semi-humorous edited compilation of messages to the UNIX-HATERS mailing list. The book was edited by Simson Garfinkel, Daniel Weise and Steven Strassmann and published in 1994.

== Contents ==

The book concerns the frustrations of users of the Unix operating system. Many users had come from systems that they felt were far more sophisticated in features and usability, and they were frustrated by the perceived &quot;worse is better&quot; design philosophy that they felt Unix and much of its software encapsulated.

The book is based on messages sent to the UNIX-HATERS mailing list between 1988 and 1993, and contains a foreword by the human factors guru Don Norman and an &quot;anti-foreword&quot; by Dennis Ritchie, one of the creators of the operating system.

Many of the book&#x27;s complaints about the Unix operating system are based on design decisions and anomalies in the command-line interface.

The front-matter page&#x27;s dedication says: &quot;To Ken and Dennis, without whom this book would not have been possible.&quot;, referring to Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, the creators of Unix.

== Release ==

This book was printed as a trade paperback. Its front cover was designed to be similar to &quot;The Scream&quot;. An air sickness bag, printed with the phrase &quot;UNIX barf bag&quot;, was inserted into the inside back cover of every copy by the publisher.

The book was made available to download for free in electronic format in 2003.

== Reception ==

Later reviewers of the book have noted that some issues were resolved in the future, such as the development of the ext2 filesystem addressing the discussed lack of block storage.

<doc id="510292" wikidata="Q725622" url="?curid=510292" title="Chic Young">
<text>Murat Bernard &quot;Chic&quot; Young (January 9, 1901March 14, 1973) was an American cartoonist who created the comic strip &quot;Blondie&quot;. His 1919 &quot;William McKinley High School Yearbook&quot; cites his nickname as Chicken, source of his familiar pen name and signature. According to King Features Syndicate, Young had a daily readership of 52 million. Stan Drake, who drew &quot;Blondie&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s, stated that Young &quot;has to go down in history as one of the geniuses of the industry.&quot;

==Comic strips==
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Young began drawing with the encouragement of his mother, who was an artist. Although his father James was a shoe salesman who didn&#x27;t think much of artists, all of the children in the family were creative: Walter was a painter, daughter Jamar entered the commercial art field and Lyman, Chic&#x27;s older brother, drew the &quot;Tim Tyler&#x27;s Luck&quot; comic strip for King Features. It was Lyman who spurred Chic to constantly draw.

Chic Young grew up in a German-Lutheran neighborhood on the south side of St. Louis. After graduating from high school in St. Louis, he returned to Chicago where he worked as a stenographer while taking night classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1921, he learned that the Newspaper Enterprise Association was seeking an artist to do a comic strip about an attractive young woman. He headed for Cleveland and earned a weekly salary of $22 () while drawing &quot;The Affairs of Jane&quot; about a struggling film actress who dreamed of graduating from low-budget pictures to stardom. The short-lived strip, which began in 1921 on Halloween, came to a conclusion five months later on March 18, 1922. In the NEA art department, Young worked near cartoonist Gene Ahern, and the two often played pranks on each other. When a call came from King Features&#x27; J. Gortatowski offering an annual salary of $10,000 (), Young thought it was a prank and turned down the job. Looking for work later, he applied to Gortatowski and learned the call was legitimate.

After six months in Cleveland, Young left for New York where he created another female flapper strip, &quot;Beautiful Bab&quot;, which the Bell Syndicate began distributing on July 15, 1922. It ran for only four months but landed him a job in the art department of King Features Syndicate, mainly as an assistant to cartoonist Jack Callahan, adopting his drawing and storytelling styles. In 1924, he began &quot;Dumb Dora&quot;, about brunette Dora who &quot;wasn&#x27;t as dumb as she looked.&quot;

In 1927, Young married professional harpist Athel Lindorff (d. 1979). In the spring of 1930, after six years of &quot;Dumb Dora&quot;&#x27;s increasing popularity, Young requested more money and strip ownership. This action led to changes, and Paul Fung took over &quot;Dumb Dora&quot; in April 1930 when Young dropped it to create a new strip.

==&quot;Blondie&quot;==

In the summer of 1930, working in his studio in Great Neck, Long Island, Young created &quot;Blondie&quot;. When it debuted September 8, 1930, it quickly became the most popular comic strip in America, gaining even more readers when Blondie and Dagwood married in 1933, followed by the 1934 birth of Baby Dumpling (later known as Alexander). When his first son, Wayne, died of diphtheria in 1937, Young took a year&#x27;s hiatus; the experience made it difficult for him to draw Baby Dumpling. After Young and his wife spent a year traveling in Europe, he began &quot;Blondie&quot; once again, quelling rumors that he might not return to the strip.

With films, radio, television and products, the strip became a licensing and media bonanza that made Young a wealthy man. During his lifetime, he produced more than 15,000 &quot;Blondie&quot; strips. Described by former King Features president Joseph Connelly as &quot;the greatest story teller of his kind since the immortal Charles Dickens,&quot; Young at his peak received more fan mail than any other cartoonist. His other works include the strip &quot;Colonel Potterby and the Duchess&quot;, which ran as a topper strip on the &quot;Blondie&quot; page from 1935 through 1963.

Young worked with several assistants, including Alex Raymond and Ray McGill. Alex Raymond&#x27;s younger brother, Jim Raymond, who began as Young&#x27;s assistant in 1935, took over all the art in 1950 when Young&#x27;s eyesight began to fail.

, &quot;Blondie&quot; is written by Chic Young&#x27;s son, Dean Young, and illustrated by John Marshall.
==Personal life==

Living in suburban New Rochelle, New York, Chic and Athel had two other children, Dean Young and Jeanne. In 1939, Young relocated his family to California to be more closely involved with the popular &quot;Blondie&quot; film series for Columbia Pictures. In the early 1950s, the entire family vacationed in Paris, and a few years later, they moved to Florida, prompting his comment, &quot;We reside on a little island off the west coast of Florida, where the porpoises and pelicans entertain me while I work on the strip. Hobbies? Oh, fishing, golf, very amateurish Oriental cooking and such nonsense.&quot;

Young died of a pulmonary embolism on March 14, 1973, at the Apollo Medical Center in St. Petersburg, Florida, at the age of 72. He had been in ill health for some time, remaining near his home in Clearwater Beach, Florida.

==Awards==
Chic Young received the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Reuben Award for &quot;Blondie&quot; in 1948, only one of many awards.

<doc id="510295" wikidata="Q3886299" url="?curid=510295" title="Italian orthography">
<text>Italian orthography (the conventions used in writing Italian) uses the Latin alphabet to write the Italian language. This article focuses on the writing of Standard Italian, based historically on the Florentine variety of Tuscan.

Written Italian is very regular and almost completely phonemic—having an almost one-to-one correspondence between letters (or sequences of letters) and sounds (or sequences of sounds). The main exceptions are that stress placement and vowel quality (for and ) are not notated, and may be voiced or not, and may represent vowels or semivowels, and a silent is used in a very few cases other than the digraphs and (used for the hard and sounds before and ).

==Alphabet==
The base alphabet consists of 21 letters: five vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and 16 consonants. The letters J, K, W, X and Y are not part of the proper alphabet, but appear in words of ancient Greek origin (e.g. &quot;Xilofono&quot;), loanwords (e.g. &quot;weekend&quot;), foreign names (e.g. John), scientific terms (e.g. km) and in a handful of native words—such as the names &quot;Kalsa&quot;, &quot;Jesolo&quot;, &quot;Bettino Craxi&quot;, and &quot;Cybo&quot;, which all derive from regional languages. In addition, grave and acute accents may modify vowel letters; circumflex accent is much rarer and is found only in older texts.


Double consonants represent true geminates and are pronounced as such: , &quot;year&quot;, pronounced (cf. English &quot;ten nails&quot;). The short–long length contrast is phonemic, e.g. , &quot;upright&quot;, vs. , &quot;rite, ritual&quot;, , &quot;cart, wagon&quot;, vs. , &quot;dear, expensive&quot;.

==Vowels==
The Italian alphabet has five vowel letters, . Of those, only represents one sound value, while all others have two. In addition, and indicate a different pronunciation of a preceding or (see below).

In stressed syllables, represents both open and close . Similarly, represents both open and close (see Italian phonology for further details on those sounds). There is typically no orthographic distinction between the open and close sounds represented, although accent marks are used in certain instances (see below). There are some minimal pairs, called heteronyms, where the same spelling is used for distinct words with distinct vowel sounds. In unstressed syllables, only the close variants occur.

In addition to representing the vowels and , and also typically represent the semivowels and , when unstressed and occurring before another vowel. Many exceptions exist (e.g. , , , , , , , , , , , ). An may indicate that a preceding or is &quot;soft&quot; ().

==C and G==

The letters and represent the plosives and before and before the vowels , , . They represent the affricates and when they precede a front vowel ( or ).

The letter can also function within digraphs (two letters representing one sound) and to indicate &quot;soft&quot; (affricate) or before another vowel. In these instances, the vowel following the digraph is stressed, and represents no vowel sound: (), (). An item such as &quot;CIA&quot; &quot;CIA&quot;, pronounced with stressed, contains no digraph.

For words of more than one syllable, stress position must be known in order to distinguish between digraph or containing no actual phonological vowel and sequences of affricate and stressed . For example, the words , &quot;shirt&quot;, and , &quot;pharmacy&quot;, share the spelling , but contrast in that only the first is stressed in , thus represents with no sound (likewise, &quot;grigio&quot; ends in and the names and contain only two actual vowels: , ). In is stressed, so that is not a digraph, but represents two of the three constituents of .

When the &quot;hard&quot; (plosive) pronunciation or occurs before a front vowel or , digraphs and are used, so that represents or and represents or . The same principle applies to : and represent or and or .

In the evolution from Latin to Italian, the postalveolar affricates and were contextual variants of the velar consonants and . They eventually came to be full phonemes, and orthographic adjustments were introduced to distinguish them. The phonemicity of the affricates can be demonstrated with minimal pairs:

The trigraphs and are used to indicate geminate and , when they occur before or ; e.g. &quot;eyes&quot;, &quot;to dress up&quot;. The double letters and before or and and before other vowels represent the geminated affricates and , e. g. , &quot;hedgehog&quot;, , &quot;worse&quot;.

 joins with to form a digraph representing palatal before (before other vowels, the trigraph is used), and with to represent with any vowel following. Between vowels these are pronounced phonetically long, as in , &quot;garlic&quot;, , &quot;each&quot;. By way of exception, before represents in some words derived from Greek, such as , &quot;wisteria&quot;, from learned Latin, such as , &quot;negligent&quot;, and in a few adaptations from other languages such as , partially italianised from French . before vowels other than represents straightforward .

The digraph is used before and to represent ; before other vowels, is used for . Otherwise, represents , the of which follows the normal orthographic rules explained above.

Intervocalic , , and are always geminated and no orthographic distinction is made to indicate this.

Some words are spelled with , , and . Historically, the letters in these combinations represented a diphthong, but in modern pronunciation these combinations are indistinguishable from , , and . Notable examples: &quot;blind&quot; (homophonous with , &quot;Czech&quot;), &quot;sky&quot; (homophonous with , &quot;I conceal&quot;), &quot;science&quot;.

The plurals of words ending in -, - are written with -, - if preceded by a vowel (, &quot;skirt&quot; → , &quot;skirts&quot;, , &quot;suitcase&quot; → , &quot;suitcases&quot;) or with -, - if preceded by a consonant (, &quot;province&quot; → , &quot;provinces&quot;). This rule has been established since the 1950s; prior to that, etymological spellings such as and were in use.

The letter combination is pronounced the same as and occurs when the ending (1st person plural present indicative and 1st person plural present subjunctive) or (2nd person plural present subjunctive) is attached to a stem ending in : , &quot;to dream&quot; → , &quot;we dream&quot;.

Normally is represented by , but it is represented by in some words, such as , , , , , and . These words all contain a sequence derived from an original which was subsequently diphthongised. The sequence is always spelled (e.g. ), with exceptions being spelled in the words , its derivation , and and , two alternative forms of or .

==S and Z==
 and are ambiguous to voicing.

 represents a dental sibilant consonant, either or . However, these two phonemes are in complementary distribution everywhere except between two vowels in the same word and, even with such words, there are very few minimal pairs.
* The voiceless occurs:
** At the start of a word before a vowel (e.g. ) or a voiceless consonant (e.g. )
** After any consonant (e.g. )
** Before a voiceless consonant (e.g. )
** At the start of the second part of a compound word (e.g. , , , , , ). These words are formed by adding a prefix to a word beginning with 
* The voiced occurs before voiced consonants (e.g. ).
* It can be either voiceless or voiced ( or ) between vowels; in standard Tuscany-based pronunciation some words are pronounced with between vowels (e.g. , , , , , , , , ), but most words are pronounced with (e.g. , , , , ); in Northern Italy (and also increasingly in Tuscany) between vowels is always pronounced with whereas in Southern Italy between vowels is always pronounced .

 always represents voiceless : , , , etc.

 represents a dental affricate consonant; either ( ) or ( ), depending on context, although there are few minimal pairs.
* It is normally voiceless :
** At the start of a word in which the second syllable starts with a voiceless consonant ( , , )
*** Exceptions (because they are of Greek origin): , , , , , 
** When followed by an which is followed, in turn, by another vowel (e.g. , , )
*** Exceptions: , all words derived from words obeying other rules (e.g. , which is derived from )
** After the letter (e.g. )
*** Exceptions: and 
** In the suffixes &quot;-anza&quot;, &quot;-enza&quot; and &quot;-onzolo&quot; (e.g. , , )
* It is normally voiced :
** At the start of a word in which the second syllable starts with a voiced consonant or the letter itself (e.g. , )
*** Exceptions: , 
** At the start of a word when followed by two vowels (e.g. )
*** Exceptions: and its derived terms (see above)
** If it is single (not doubled) and between two single vowels (e.g. )
*** Exceptions: (from the German pronunciation of )

Between vowels and/or semivowels ( and ), is pronounced as if doubled ( or , e.g. , ). Generally, intervocalic &quot;z&quot; is written doubled, but it is written single in most words where it precedes followed by any vowel and in some learned words.

 may represent either a voiceless alveolar affricate or its voiced counterpart : voiceless in e.g. , , , , voiced in , , , , , . Most words are consistently pronounced with or throughout Italy in the standard language (e.g. &quot;magpie&quot;, &quot;mug&quot;), but a few words, such as , &quot;effervesce, sting&quot;, exist in both voiced and voiceless forms, differing by register or by geographic area, while others have different meanings depending on whether they are pronounced in voiced or voiceless form (e.g. : (race, breed) or (ray, skate)). The verbal ending &quot;-izzare&quot; from Greek -ίζειν is always pronounced (e.g. ), maintained in both inflected forms and derivations: &quot;I organise&quot;, &quot;organisation&quot;. Like above, however, not all verbs ending in -&quot;izzare&quot; continue suffixed Greek -ίζειν, having instead -&quot;izz&quot;- as part of the verb stem. , for example, of Latin origin reconstructed as *, has in all forms containing the root &quot;indirizz&quot;-.

==Silent H==
In addition to being used to indicate a hard or before front vowels (see above), is used to distinguish , , , (present indicative of , &quot;to have&quot;) from (&quot;or&quot;), (&quot;to the&quot;, m. pl.), (&quot;to&quot;), (&quot;year&quot;); since is always silent, there is no difference in the pronunciation of such words. The letter is also used in some interjections, where it always comes immediately after the first vowel in the word (e.g. , , , ). In filler words and both ⟨h⟩ and the preceding vowel are silent. ⟨h⟩ is used in some loanwords, by far the most common of which is , but also &quot;handicap, habitat, hardware, hall&quot; (&quot;lobby, foyer&quot;), &quot;hamburger, horror, hobby.&quot; Silent is also found in some Italian toponyms: Chorio, Dho, Hano, Mathi, Noha, Proh, Rho, Roghudi, Santhià, Tharros, Thiene, Thiesi, Thurio, Vho; and surnames: &quot;Dahò&quot;, &quot;Dehò&quot;, &quot;De Bartholomaeis&quot;, &quot;De Thomasis&quot;, &quot;Matthey&quot;, &quot;Rahò&quot;, &quot;Rhodio&quot;, &quot;Tha&quot;, &quot;Thei&quot;, &quot;Theodoli&quot;, &quot;Thieghi&quot;, &quot;Thiella&quot;, &quot;Thiglia&quot;, &quot;Tholosano&quot;, &quot;Thomatis&quot;, &quot;Thorel&quot;, &quot;Thovez&quot;.

==J, K, W, X and Y==
The letter (, &quot;long I&quot;, or ) is not considered part of the standard Italian alphabet; however, it is used in some Latin words, in proper nouns (such as Jesi, Letojanni, Juventus, etc.), in words borrowed from foreign languages (most common: &quot;jeans&quot;, but also &quot;jazz&quot;, &quot;jet&quot;, &quot;jeep&quot;, &quot;banjo&quot;), and in an archaic spelling of Italian.

Until the 19th century, was used in Italian instead of in word-initial rising diphthongs, as a replacement for final -, and between vowels (as in ); this rule was quite strict in official writing.

The letter represents in Latin and Italian and dialect words such as Romanesco dialect &quot;ajo&quot; (&quot;garlic&quot;; cf. Italian ); it represents in borrowings from English (including &quot;judo&quot;, borrowed from Japanese via English); and in borrowings from French (&quot;julienne, bijou&quot;).

The letters (), ( or , &quot;double V&quot;), () and ( or , &quot;Greek I&quot;) are not part of the standard Italian alphabet and are used only in unassimilated or partially assimilated loanwords.

The letter is used in &quot;karma&quot;, &quot;kayak&quot;, &quot;kiwi&quot;, &quot;kamikaze&quot;, etc.; it is always pronounced . It is often used informally among young people as a replacement for , paralleling the use of in English (for example, &quot;ke&quot; instead of &quot;che&quot;).

The letter is used in &quot;web&quot;, &quot;whisky&quot;, &quot;water&quot;, &quot;water closet / toilet&quot;, &quot;western&quot;, &quot;Western movie&quot;, &quot;watt&quot;, etc; it is alternately pronounced (in &quot;web&quot;, &quot;whisky&quot;, &quot;western&quot;) or (in &quot;water&quot;, &quot;watt&quot;). A capital is used as an abbreviation of or (&quot;long live&quot;). Although is named or , in initialisms such as it is normally read simply as .

The letter represents either , as in , , , or when it is preceded by and followed by a vowel, e.g. . In most words, it may be replaced with or (with different pronunciation: /, /) or, rarely, by (with the same pronunciation: /clacson). In some other languages of Italy, it represents (Venetian), (Sicilian), or (Sardinian and Ligurian).

The letter is used in &quot;yoga&quot;, &quot;yogurt&quot;, &quot;yacht&quot;, &quot;Uruguay&quot;, etc. This letter is sometimes replaced by in some words such as &quot;yoga/ioga&quot; and &quot;yogurt/iogurt&quot;, but the spellings with are much more common.

==Diacritics==

The acute accent (´) may be used on and to represent stressed close-mid vowels. This use of accents is generally mandatory only to indicate stress on a word-final vowel; elsewhere, accents are generally found only in dictionaries. Since final is hardly ever close-mid, is very rarely encountered in written Italian (e.g. , &quot;subway&quot;, from the original French pronunciation of with a final-stressed ).

The grave accent (`) is found on , , , , . It may be used on and when they represent open-mid vowels. The accents may also be used to differentiate minimal pairs within Italian (for example , &quot;peach&quot;, vs. , &quot;fishing&quot;), but in practice this is limited to didactic texts. In the case of final and , both diacritics are encountered. By far the most common option is the grave accent, and , although this may be due to the rarity of the acute accent to represent stress; the alternative of employing the acute, and , is in practice limited to erudite texts, but can be justified as both vowels are high (as in Catalan). However, since there are no corresponding low (or lax) vowels to contrast with in Italian, both choices are equally acceptable.

The circumflex accent (ˆ) can be used to mark the contraction of two unstressed vowels ending a word, normally pronounced , so that the plural of , &quot;study, office&quot;, may be written , or . The form with circumflex is found mainly in older texts, although it may still appear in contexts where ambiguity might arise from homography. For example, it can be used to differentiate words such as (&quot;genes&quot;, plural of ) and (&quot;geniuses&quot;, plural of ) or (&quot;princes&quot;, plural of ) and (&quot;principles&quot;, plural of ). In general, current usage usually prefers a single instead of a double or an with circumflex.

Monosyllabic words generally lack an accent (e.g. , ). The accent is written, however, if there is an or a preceding another vowel (, ). This applies even if the is &quot;silent&quot;, i.e. part of the digraphs or representing and (, ). It does not apply, however, if the word begins with (, ). Many monosyllabic words are spelled with an accent in order to avoid ambiguity with other words (e.g. , versus , ). This is known as and also occurs in other Romance languages (e.g. the Spanish ).

&quot;Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita

mi ritrovai per una selva oscura

ché la diritta via era smarrita.&quot;

Lines 1–3 of Canto 1 of the Inferno, Part 1 of the &quot;Divina Commedia&quot; by Dante Alighieri, a highly influential poem. Translation (Longfellow): &quot;Midway upon the journey of our life \ I found myself in a dark wood \ for the straight way was lost.&quot;

<text>The Senyera is a vexillological symbol based on the coat of arms of the Crown of Aragon, which consists of four red stripes on a yellow field. This coat of arms, often called &quot;bars of Aragon&quot;, or simply &quot;the four bars&quot;, historically represented the King of the Crown of Aragon.

The senyera pattern is currently in the flag of four Spanish autonomous communities (Aragon, Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and the Valencian Community), and is the flag of the historically Catalan-speaking city of Alghero (Catalan: &quot;L&#x27;Alguer&quot;) in Sardinia, Italy. It is also used on the coat of arms of Spain, the coat of arms of the Pyrénées-Orientales department and of Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur, the flag of Roussillon, Capcir, Vallespir, and Provence in France, on the coat of arms of Andorra, and on the local flags of many municipalities belonging to these territories. The Senyera (sometimes together with the flag of Andorra) is also used informally in Catalonia to represent the Catalan language.

It is also a synonym (in Catalan &quot;Senyal Reial or Senyera&quot; and old Spanish &quot;Señal Real or Señera&quot;) for &quot;Royal Flag&quot;, although the word normally refers to the Aragonese and Catalan flags. Also in Aragonese, it is usually referred to as &quot;O Sinyal d&#x27;Aragón&quot;, i.e. &quot;The Sign of Aragón&quot;.

==Origin and history==

The Senyera is one of the oldest flags in Europe still used in the present. There are several theories advocating either a purely Aragonese or a purely Catalan origin for the symbol.

The &quot;Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa&quot; states that its first material undisputed evidence dates back to a royal seal of Alfonso II of Aragon (1159), and that all evidence about a &quot;Catalan&quot; origin is debatable since historically nothing can be accepted other than the concept of &quot;Barcelonès&quot;, and understanding that as allusive to the House of Barcelona (Counts of Barcelona), and then, nothing referring to the ancient geographical area known as &quot;Cathalania&quot;, &quot;Catalonie&quot; (Catalonia) where the County of Barcelona was found.

The &quot;Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana&quot; (1968) claims that the first appearance of the flag is in the arms of the tomb of Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona, died in 1082 as well as later in the seals of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona of Barcelona and III of Provence in Provençal (1150) and then in Catalan (1157) documents.

Besides, amongst the ancient manuscripts preserved today in Poblet Monastery is found a &quot;carte plegada on son tots los Reys d&#x27;Arago e Comtes de Barchinona figurats&quot;, a genealogical roll of the Kings of Aragon and Counts of Barcelona commissioned between 1396 and 1400 by King Martin I of Aragon. In the document, the four red stripes on a golden background appears only in the royal images painted of Wilfred the Hairy Count of Barcelona (878–897), Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona (1131–1162), King Martin I of Aragon (1356–1410) and King Martin I of Sicily (1390–1409). So it may suggest the &quot;Four Red Bars on Golden Background&quot; emblem was believed to belong to the House of Barcelona and the Counts of Barcelona in times of the initial dynasty (1164–1410) who ruled the Crown of Aragon.

Furthermore, the Pennon of the Conquest of Valencia is documented as the world&#x27;s oldest extant flag, dating from 1238, even though the yellow part was originally white, but the red stripes design was the same.

The Government of Catalonia states about its official symbols that it may derive from 11th century or 12th century pre-heraldic symbols and the County of Barcelona&#x27;s coat of arms, in which the yellow and red bars were vertical, while horizontal in the flag. The dynastic coat of arms became also the one for the lands ruled by the counts. It is thus present in the flags and shields of the territories that once were part of the Crown of Aragon and also in the arms of Andorra, Provence-Côte d&#x27;Azur and Sicily among others.
Another version is that the Kings of Aragon used and adopted the colours of the Papal States in their own coat of arms as a public and notorious submission to the Pope, something which the County of Barcelona would have followed shortly after according to this version. The colours for the city of Rome, which in those times was controlled by the Pope, were the same. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, the flag of the Holy See&#x27;s Navy from the 12th century on consisted of two vertical red and yellow bands, sometimes bearing the tiara and the keys. According to the Vatican official website, the yellow and red of the flag of the Holy See were two colours traditional of the Roman Senate and People. This ancient flag can still be seen on the Capitoline Hill in Rome, near the Roman Forum. The Papal States changed its colours in 1808 to the present yellow and white, while the City of Rome sticks to the old colours to this day. We can reject this theory based on the works of Geronimo de Blancas, chronicler of the Kingdom of Aragon, 1585. This author reports that Pope Innocent III after crowning the King Pedro II (the Catholic) accepted that Aragon was a tributary kingdom of the Apostolic See. To compensate for this gesture the Pope appointed King Peter II Gonfalonier of the Church and that the Church&#x27;s banner had the colours of the crown of Aragon.

The Almogavars of the Catalan Company used a royal pennon with the arms of the Kings of Aragon when campaigning in the Byzantine Empire. It was used as ensign of the Aragonese Navy from 1263 to 1516.

The plain version of this was used as official flag of the Autonomous Community of Catalonia during the Second Spanish Republic and since the Spanish transition to democracy. In its plain version, it is also used in the French &quot;département&quot; of Pyrénées-Orientales (Northern Catalonia), part of the former Principality of Catalonia until 1659. It is also used as the flag of Provence, a distinct region with historic ties to the Counts of Barcelona and the Crown of Aragon.

The blazon of this standard version is &quot;Or, four bars Gules&quot;.

===Modern usage===
The senyera pattern is nowadays in the flag of four Spanish autonomous communities: without any change for Catalonia, and, with variations, for the territories of the former kingdoms of the Crown of Aragon: Aragon proper, the Balearic Islands and Valencia (while the latter two are modern interpretations, the Valencian &quot;Senyera Coronada&quot; does originate back to medieval times). It also forms the basis of various unofficial versions, such as the blue or red estelada used by Catalan independence supporters.
The senyera is also the basis for the coat of arms of Pyrénées-Orientales, the flag of the pays of Roussillon in France, and one quarter of the Coat of arms of Andorra. Dozens of municipalities belonging to these territories base their local flags on the Senyera as well.

=== Origin legends ===
According to a 14th-century legend, the flag dates back from the 9th century, when the four red bars were drawn, as an act of gratitude, on Wilfred I the Hairy&#x27;s (Count of Barcelona) golden shield by king Charles the Bald&#x27;s fingers drenched with blood from the Count&#x27;s war wounds prior to Wilfred&#x27;s death in 897 during the siege of Barcelona by Lobo ibn Mohammed, the Moorish governor of Lleida. This legend would relate the emblem unambiguously to the Counts of Barcelona title. However, Charles the Bald had died 20 years earlier, in 877. Romantic-driven Catalan nationalists were particularly keen on this legend during the Renaixença, in the 19th century, albeit it has always been recognized and divulged as such even in patriotic circles.

Another version of this legend cites Louis the Pious as the king drawing the bars during the conquest of Barcelona, in this version drawing them in a golden shield, but Louis died before Guifré was born. Also, Barcelona was conquered long before the events described on the legend. Another medieval variant of the legend features Ramon Berenguer painting the bars with his own blood on a yellow shield, with the yellow field of the shield being the arms of Aragon before his marriage.

== Variations ==
There are a few variations in the official flags of other territories. For instance, in Aragon an extra coat-of-arms, in Balearic Islands a castle in the canton, and in València a blue crowned fringe on the hoist.

<text>Oberursel (Taunus) () is a town in Germany and part of the Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area. It is located to the north west of Frankfurt, in the Hochtaunuskreis county. It is the 13th largest town in Hesse. In 2012, the town hosted the 51st Hessentag state festival.

==Geography==

===Extent of municipal area===
The maximum distance from the northern town border to the southern border is the maximum distance from east to west is .

Altitude
*Krebsmühle (Weißkirchen): 138 m above sea level
*Town Hall: 198 m above sea level
*Hohemark: 300 m above sea level
*The nearly Grosse Feldberg is the highest spot in the Taunus: 820 m above sea level

===Neighbouring communities===
To the north Oberursel borders with Schmitten, to the east with Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, to the south-east with Frankfurt, to the southwest with Steinbach and to the west with Kronberg.

===Town districts===
Besides the town centre (including Bommersheim), Oberursel is divided into the districts Oberstedten (population 6,118), Stierstadt (5,541) and Weißkirchen (Oberursel) (5,151). Bommersheim was annexed before the municipal reform of 1972 and therefore is not an independent district.

==History==


The town was first mentioned as &quot;Ursella&quot; in 791 in a deed recording a donation to the monastery Lorsch. In the year 880 the first church in the area, called &quot;monasterium ad ursellam&quot;, was mentioned. In 1317 the first trading activities were documented. 
In 1444 Oberursel was officially sanctioned as a town. Two years later, the town wall was finished. Since the town was growing so fast in the 15th century the town walls had to be expanded in 1481 towards the east. In the early 16th century a school for Latin language was established next to the church.

1535 Oberursel become property of Earl Ludwig von Stolberg-Königstein and becomes a Protestant town.
1557 Nicolaus Henricus built the first printing plant in Oberursel.
1605 due to the Counter-Reformation Oberursel becomes Catholic again.
The most important industry in the late Middle Ages and in the early modern times was the clothier business.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the town was destroyed three times, in 1622 and 1645, and the number of inhabitants decreased from 1,600 to 600. During the 1645 razing, most buildings were destroyed by fire; the three surviving buildings were the old town hall, the bakery, and one apartment house near the marketplace. This is the reason why nearly all houses in the old town of Oberursel are from the 17th century.

As the town was rebuilt and grew, many mills and forges were founded along the &quot;Urselbachtal&quot;.
By 1858, industrialisation had begun in Oberursel, with several cotton-spinning mills being built.
In 1860 Oberursel was linked to the railway between Bad Homburg and Frankfurt.
In 1899 a subway was opened privately in the direction of Hohemark (currently Line U3).

During the Second World War, many captured American and British airmen passed through Oberursel as they were interrogated and processed into the German POW camp system at the &quot;Durchgangslager der Luftwaffe&quot; or &quot;Transit Camp of the Luftwaffe&quot; located in the town. The camp name was commonly shortened to &quot;Dulag Luft&quot;, or simply &quot;Dulag&quot;. Almost all allied airmen who were shot down and captured spent some time at that camp before being moved to their permanent assigned &quot;Stalag&quot;.

After the occupation of Oberursel by the U.S. in April 1945, the &quot;Dulag&quot; area was taken over by the US Army.
The existing buildings were transformed into Camp King, which began as an intelligence post, then later a transportation post until its de-activation in 1993. Today the former Camp King is a residential area, still populated by several former US soldiers.

===Growth===
In 1929 Bommersheim was annexed; in 1972 Oberstedten, Stierstadt and Weißkirchen followed.

<doc id="510308" wikidata="Q642737" url="?curid=510308" title="Grace (Jeff Buckley album)">
<text>Grace is the only studio album by the American singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley, released on August 15, 1994 in Europe and on August 23, 1994 in the United States by Columbia Records. It was produced by Buckley and Andy Wallace. 

After moving from Los Angeles to New York City in 1991, Buckley amassed a following through his performances at Sin-é, a cafe in the East Village, and signed to Columbia in 1993. He recorded &quot;Grace&quot; in Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York, with musicians including Gary Lucas, Mick Grondahl, Michael Tighe and Matt Johnson. It includes versions of the jazz standard &quot;Lilac Wine&quot;, the hymn &quot;Corpus Christi Carol&quot; and the 1984 Leonard Cohen song &quot;Hallelujah&quot;. 

&quot;Grace&quot; did not meet Columbia&#x27;s sales expectations, reaching number 149 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and initially received mixed reviews. After Buckley&#x27;s death in 1997, its critical standing grew and it was praised by musicians including Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, Bob Dylan and David Bowie. By 2011, it had achieved sales of two million, and in 2016 it was certified platinum in the US. 

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Grace&quot; in three of its lists of the 500 greatest albums and named Buckley&#x27;s version of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; one of the 500 greatest songs. In 2008, &quot;Hallelujah&quot; became Buckley&#x27;s first number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Digital Songs and reached number two in the UK singles chart. In 2014, it was inducted into the American Library of Congress&#x27; National Recording Registry. 

== Background ==
In Los Angeles in the early 1990s, Buckley met the guitarist Gary Lucas and wrote the songs &quot;Grace&quot; and &quot;Mojo Pin&quot; with him. He performed both songs during his brief time as a member of Lucas&#x27;s band Gods and Monsters.

Buckley moved to New York City in 1991, and performed regularly at Sin-é, a cafe in the East Village, Manhattan. He built a following and attracted attention from major record labels. In October 1992, Buckley signed a record contract with Columbia Records. His debut EP, &quot;Live at Sin-é&quot;, was released in 1993.&quot;&quot;

In the weeks before recording began for his debut album, Buckley assembled a band and delayed work until he felt he had found the right musicians. He met the bassist Mick Grondahl at a concert at Columbia University, and recruited him following a jam session at Buckley&#x27;s apartment.&quot;&quot; Buckley&#x27;s girlfriend, Rebecca Moore, introduced him to the drummer Matt Johnson, and Buckley invited him to audition at a rehearsal, where they created the structure for &quot;Dream Brother&quot;. The band began recording &quot;Grace&quot; soon after. Johnson said it was &quot;really scary&quot; to go from meeting someone to recording so quickly.

== Recording ==
&quot;Grace&quot; was produced by Andy Wallace and recorded in Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York. Buckley experimented extensively with arrangements and recording techniques. He found the process of recording contrary to his improvisational performance style, and said later: &quot;It&#x27;s not like a live show where you play it and it just disappears into the air like smoke. It&#x27;s like painting, sound painting. It&#x27;s in a crystalized form, so it&#x27;s very nerve-wracking: which brain cell do I put down here forever and ever?”

Recording was disrupted when Buckley was upset by a negative review of &quot;Live at Sin-é&quot; in &quot;Newsday&quot;, which likened his voice to Michael Bolton and wrote that he was derivative of &quot;black idioms ... awkwardly reach[ing] for a balance of emotion and technique, eventually relying on sheer voice of will, oversinging, flaking out&quot;. Wallace said Buckley was &quot;almost apoplectic&quot; about the criticism and stopped work for two days.

As he had not completed enough original songs for an album, Buckley recorded three covers: the jazz standard &quot;Lilac Wine&quot;, the hymn &quot;Corpus Christi Carol&quot; (based on an arrangement by Benjamin Britten), and the 1984 Leonard Cohen song &quot;Hallelujah&quot;. Buckley based his version of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; on the cover by John Cale, and was not familiar with Cohen&#x27;s original. He recorded more than 20 takes; the final version was edited together from several recordings. Lucas contributed guitar to the songs he co-wrote, &quot;Grace&quot; and &quot;Mojo Pin&quot;.

Near the end of the sessions, Buckley presented another song, &quot;Forget Her&quot;, and he and the band quickly recorded it. The Columbia felt the song had commercial potential, but Buckley and the band were unsure. In late 1994, Buckley enlisted another guitarist, Moore&#x27;s childhood friend Michael Tighe. During one rehearsal, Tighe played a descending chord progression that Buckley developed into &quot;So Real&quot;. In early 1995, while recording B-sides for the &quot;Grace&quot; singles, the band quickly recorded &quot;So Real&quot; and Buckley used it to replace &quot;Forget Her&quot;. Tighe recalled: &quot;He got really excited and was like, ‘Oh, my record is saved because I have this song &#x27;So Real&#x27; now ... He felt that it tipped the balance of that record to the favorable side of the spectrum, aesthetically.&quot; The decision concerned the executives, but Buckley insisted.

== Cover ==
The cover photograph was taken by Buckley&#x27;s friend Merri Cyr. It depicts Buckley with his eyes closed, holding a microphone and wearing a women&#x27;s sequinned jacket he purchased from a thrift store. Buckley was listening to a playback of &quot;Dream Brother&quot; when the photo was taken. The Columbia executives felt it sent the wrong message; some felt he looked like the new wave singer Adam Ant, while the Sony head, Don Ienner, said he looked like a lounge singer. Buckley rejected Columbia&#x27;s suggested alternatives, saying he liked the peaceful expression on his face listening to music. Cyr said the photo captured Buckley&#x27;s &quot;split personality&quot; and the conflict he felt seeking media exposure on a major label while &quot;wanting to act like he was on an indie label&quot;.

== Music ==
&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described &quot;Grace&quot; as a blend of &quot;choirboy cabaret&quot; and Led Zeppelin guitar, with vocals that &quot;spiral into spasms of romantic despair&quot;. &quot;Uncut&quot; said it combined &quot;androgynous vocals, ’70s rock, power chords and heroic drumming&quot;. The lyrics for &quot;Grace&quot; were inspired by Buckley&#x27;s separation from his ex-girlfriend at the airport before moving to New York City.

==Release==
Buckley toured internationally for 18 months to promote &quot;Grace&quot;. According to the &quot;Mojo&quot; critic Jim Irvin, the performances &quot;veered between delicate acoustic sets and full-scale sonic onslaughts&quot;, with Buckley &quot;becoming increasingly interested in the harder end of the sound and the power of a band&quot;. &quot;Grace&quot;, &quot;Last Goodbye&quot;, &quot;So Real&quot; and &quot;Eternal Life&quot; were released as singles. 

&quot;Grace&quot; did not meet Columbia&#x27;s sales expectations and did not achieve wide popularity in Buckley&#x27;s lifetime. It received little radio airplay. It spent seven weeks on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, reaching number 149. By the time of Buckley&#x27;s death in 1997, it had sold 175,000 copies. It was more successful in Australia, where it reached number 9 on the ARIA charts. 

&quot;Grace&quot; became more popular after Buckley&#x27;s death in 1997. By 2011, it had achieved worldwide sales of two million. In February 2016, it was certified platinum in the US for sales of one million. In December 2008, Buckley&#x27;s cover of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; reached number two on the UK singles chart, behind a version by Alexandra Burke, who performed it on series 5 of the British version of &quot;The X Factor&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Grace&quot; initially received mixed reviews. According to &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, its jazz and classical influences disappointed critics expecting &quot;the next great alt-rock savior&quot;. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Stephanie Zacharek wrote that Buckley &quot;sounds like a man who doesn&#x27;t yet know what he wants to be&quot;, and that the &quot;meticulous arrangements sound too orchestrated, too ornate&quot;. She felt his cover of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; was not &quot;battered or desperate enough&quot;, but praised &quot;Lilac Wine&quot;, writing: &quot;His voice seems weighted down with tears that just won&#x27;t come out the normal way.&quot; In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote that Buckley was &quot;beholden to Zeppelin and Nina Simone and Chris Whitley and the Cocteau Twins ... Let us pray the force of hype blows him all the way to Uranus.&quot; 

Dimitri Ehlrich of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;Grace&quot; was &quot;dreamy and stunningly original&quot;, describing Buckley&#x27;s vocals as &quot;an angel and devil wrapped in one&quot;. Another &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer, David Browne, named it the sixth-best album of the year. He felt that though Buckley encompassed &quot;every cliché of the tortured bohemian artist&quot;, he was &quot;aiming for a higher plane, musically and spiritually, than any other singer-songwriter right now, and he succeeds enough to matter&quot;. The &quot;Guardian&quot; critic Caroline Sullivan wrote that &quot;Grace&quot; was a &quot;stunningly accomplished debut&quot;. In the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Greg Kot wrote that Buckley&#x27;s voice had &quot;a soulful intensity that sends chills&quot;, matched by the &quot;rolling-and-tumbling dynamic&quot; of the music. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; said it was &quot;a romantic masterpiece&quot; and a &quot;pivotal, defining work&quot;.

== Legacy ==
In February 1997, Buckley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, while working on his second album, &quot;My Sweetheart the Drunk&quot;. On May 29, he drowned while swimming in the Wolf River, a tributary of the Mississippi. Sales of &quot;Grace&quot; increased after his death. With the growth of the internet in the 2000s, &quot;Grace&quot; became popular among millennial and Generation Z listeners. An expanded edition was released in 2004, with an additional CD of bonus tracks and a DVD making-of documentary.

The British critic Colin Larkin included &quot;Grace&quot; at number 99 in the third edition of his book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000), writing that it &quot;achieved a perfection that was staggering for a debut album&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 303 on its 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums, number 304 in its 2012 list and 147 on its 2020 list. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Buckley&#x27;s cover of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; number 259 on its list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.

Readers of the music magazine &quot;Q&quot; voted &quot;Grace&quot; the 75th-greatest album of all time in 1998 and the 13th-greatest in 2005. In 2006, &quot;Mojo&quot; named it the No. 1 &quot;Modern Rock Classic of All Time&quot;, and it was voted Australia&#x27;s second-favorite album on the television special &quot;My Favourite Album&quot;. In 2011, VH1 named &quot;Grace&quot; the 73rd-greatest rock and roll album. In a worldwide poll of 40,000 people organized by &quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; in 2006, &quot;Grace&quot; was voted the 23rd-greatest album. On 2 April 2013, it was announced that Buckley&#x27;s version would be inducted into the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Registry. That year, &quot;Guitar World&quot; placed &quot;Grace&quot; at number 26 in its list of &quot;iconic albums that defined 1994&quot;.

The Led Zeppelin guitarist, Jimmy Page, said &quot;Grace&quot; was &quot;close to being my favorite album of the decade&quot;. The Led Zeppelin singer, Robert Plant, was also complimentary. Bob Dylan named Buckley one of the decade&#x27;s great songwriters, and David Bowie considered &quot;Grace&quot; the best album ever made. In 2010, the Smiths singer Morrissey, one of Buckley&#x27;s influences, named &quot;Grace&quot; one of his favorite albums. The Muse singer and guitarist Matt Bellamy said he did not believe his falsetto would be suitable for rock music until he heard &quot;Grace&quot;. In 2020, Bellamy purchased the Fender Telecaster Buckley used on &quot;Grace&quot; and has used it in recordings.

<text>The Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis), also known as the Sumatran rhino, hairy rhinoceros or Asian two-horned rhinoceros, is a rare member of the family Rhinocerotidae and one of five extant species of rhinoceros; it is the only extant species of the genus &quot;Dicerorhinus&quot;. It is the smallest rhinoceros, although it is still a large mammal; it stands high at the shoulder, with a head-and-body length of and a tail of . The weight is reported to range from , averaging . Like both African species, it has two horns; the larger is the nasal horn, typically , while the other horn is typically a stub. A coat of reddish-brown hair covers most of the Sumatran rhino&#x27;s body.

The Sumatran rhinoceros once inhabited rainforests, swamps and cloud forests in India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and southwestern China, particularly in Sichuan. It is now critically endangered, with only five substantial populations in the wild: four in Sumatra and one in Borneo, with an estimated total population of fewer than 80 mature individuals. The species was extirpated in Malaysia in 2019, and one of the Sumatran populations may already be extinct. In 2015, researchers announced that the Bornean rhinoceros had become extinct in the northern part of Borneo in Sabah, Malaysia. A tiny population was discovered in East Kalimantan in early 2016.

The Sumatran rhino is a mostly solitary animal except for courtship and offspring-rearing. It is the most vocal rhino species and also communicates through marking soil with its feet, twisting saplings into patterns, and leaving excrement. The species is much better studied than the similarly reclusive Javan rhinoceros, in part because of a program that brought 40 Sumatran rhinos into captivity with the goal of preserving the species. There was little or no information about procedures that would assist in &quot;ex situ&quot; breeding. Though a number of rhinos died once at the various destinations and no offspring were produced for nearly 20 years, the rhinos were all doomed in their soon-to-be-logged forest. In March 2016, a Sumatran rhinoceros (of the Bornean rhinoceros subspecies) was spotted in Indonesian Borneo.

The Indonesian ministry of Environment, began an official counting of the Sumatran rhino in February 2019, planned to be completed in three years.
Malaysia&#x27;s last known bull and cow Sumatran rhinos died in May and November 2019, respectively. The species is now considered to be locally extinct in that country, and only survives in Indonesia. There are fewer than 80 left in existence.

== Taxonomy and naming ==

The first documented Sumatran rhinoceros was shot outside Fort Marlborough, near the west coast of Sumatra, in 1793. Drawings of the animal, and a written description, were sent to the naturalist Joseph Banks, then president of the Royal Society of London, who published a paper on the specimen that year. In 1814, the species was given a scientific name by Johann Fischer von Waldheim.

The specific epithet &quot;sumatrensis&quot; signifies &quot;of Sumatra&quot;, the Indonesian island where the rhinos were first discovered. Carl Linnaeus originally classified all rhinos in the genus, &quot;Rhinoceros&quot;; therefore, the species was originally identified as &quot;Rhinoceros sumatrensis&quot; or &quot;sumatranus&quot;. Joshua Brookes considered the Sumatran rhinoceros with its two horns a distinct genus from the one-horned &quot;Rhinoceros&quot;, and gave it the name &quot;Didermocerus&quot; in 1828. Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger proposed the name &quot;Dicerorhinus&quot; in 1841. In 1868, John Edward Gray proposed the name &quot;Ceratorhinus&quot;. Normally, the oldest name would be used, but a 1977 ruling by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature established the proper genus name as &quot;Dicerorhinus&quot;. &quot;Dicerorhinus&quot; comes from the Greek terms &#x27; (, meaning &quot;two&quot;), &#x27; (, meaning &quot;horn&quot;), and &quot;&quot; (, meaning &quot;nose&quot;).

The three subspecies are:

D. s. sumatrensis, known as the western Sumatran rhinoceros, which has only 75 to 85 rhinos remaining, mostly in the national parks of Bukit Barisan Selatan and Kerinci Seblat, Gunung Leuser in Sumatra, but also in Way Kambas National Park in small numbers. They have recently gone extinct in Peninsular Malaysia. The main threats against this subspecies are habitat loss and poaching. A slight genetic difference is noted between the western Sumatran and Bornean rhinos. The rhinos in Peninsular Malaysia were once known as &quot;D. s. niger&quot;, but were later recognized to be a synonym of &quot;D. s. sumatrensis&quot;. Three bulls and five cows currently live in captivity at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary at Way Kambas, the youngest bull having been bred and born there in 2012. Another calf, a female, was born at the sanctuary in May 2016. The sanctuary&#x27;s two bulls were born at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden. A third calf female was born in March 2022.

D. s. harrissoni, known as the Bornean rhinoceros or eastern Sumatran rhinoceros, which was once common throughout Borneo; now only about 15 individuals are estimated to survive. The known population lives in East Kalimantan, with them having recently gone extinct in Sabah. Reports of animals surviving in Sarawak are unconfirmed. This subspecies is named after Tom Harrisson, who worked extensively with Bornean zoology and anthropology in the 1960s. The Bornean subspecies is markedly smaller in body size than the other two subspecies. The captive population consisted of one bull and two cows at the Borneo Rhinoceros Sanctuary in Sabah; the bull died in 2019 and the cows died in 2017 and 2019 respectively. 

D. s. lasiotis, known as the northern Sumatran rhinoceros or Chittagong rhinoceros, which once roamed India and Bangladesh, has been declared extinct in these countries. Unconfirmed reports suggest a small population may still survive in Myanmar, but the political situation in that country has prevented verification. The name &quot;lasiotis&quot; is derived from the Greek for &quot;hairy-ears&quot;. Later studies showed that their ear hair was not longer than other Sumatran rhinos, but &quot;D. s. lasiotis&quot; remained a subspecies because it was significantly larger than the other subspecies.

=== Evolution ===
Ancestral rhinoceroses first diverged from other perissodactyls in the Early Eocene. Mitochondrial DNA comparison suggests the ancestors of modern rhinos split from the ancestors of Equidae around 50 million years ago. The extant family, the Rhinocerotidae, first appeared in the Late Eocene in Eurasia, and the ancestors of the extant rhino species dispersed from Asia beginning in the Miocene.

Although the relationships of modern rhinoceros species to each other were long controversial, modern genetic evidence has placed the Sumatran rhinoceros as more closely related to the Asian one-horned rhinoceroses (the Indian rhinoceros and Javan rhinoceros) belonging to the genus &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; than to living African rhinoceros species, with the split between &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; and &quot;Dicerorhinus&quot; estimated to have occurred around 14.8 million years ago, shortly after the split between the ancestors of &quot;Dicerorhinus&quot; and &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; and African rhinoceroses, which is placed around 15.6 million years ago.

Based on morphological and genetic evidence, the Sumatran rhinoceros is believed to be closely related to the extinct woolly rhinoceros (&quot;Coelodonta antiquitatis&quot;) and &quot;Stephanorhinus&quot;, with the split between their last common ancestors estimated to be around 9.5 million years ago. The woolly rhinoceros, so named for the coat of hair it shares with the Sumatran rhinoceros, first appeared in China; by the Upper Pleistocene, it ranged across the Eurasian continent from Korea to Spain. The woolly rhinoceros survived until its extinction near the end of the last ice age, around 14,000 years ago. &quot;Stephanorhinus&quot; species are well known in Europe from the Late Pliocene through the Pleistocene, and China from the Pleistocene, with two species, &quot;Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis&quot; and the &quot;Stephanorhinus hemitoechus&quot; surviving into the last glacial period, until at least 40,000 years ago and possibly later.

Although historically many fossil species were assigned to &quot;Dicerorhinus&quot; today only two fossil species are confidently placed in the genus. These include &quot;Dicerorhinus fusuiensis&quot; from the Early Pleistocene of South China, and &quot;Dicerorhinus gwebinensis&quot; from the Pliocene-Early Pleistocene of Myanmar. Fossils of the modern Sumatran rhinoceros are known from the Early Pleistocene onwards.

Pairwise sequential Markovian coalescent (PSMC) analysis of a complete nuclear genome of a Sumatran specimen suggested strong fluctuations in population size, with a general trend of decline over the course of the Middle to Late Pleistocene with an estimated peak effective population size of 57,800 individuals 950,000 years ago, declining to around 500–1,300 individuals at the start of the Holocene, with a slight rebound during the Eemian Interglacial. This was likely due to climate change causing limiting suitable habitat for the Rhinoceros, causing severe population fluctuations as well as population fragmentation due to the flooding of Sundaland. Human induced habitat change and hunting may have played a role in the Late Pleistocene. The study was later criticised for not including DNA from extinct mainland populations, which would have provided a holistic account. A Bayesian skyline plot of complete Mitochondrial genomes from multiple individuals from across the range of the species suggested that the population had been relatively stable with an effective population size of 40,000 individuals over the last 400,000 years, with a sharp decline starting around 25,000 years ago.

== Description ==

A mature Sumatran rhino stands about high at the shoulder, has a body length of around , and weighs , though the largest individuals in zoos have been known to weigh as much as . Like the two African species, it has two horns. The larger is the nasal horn, typically only , though the longest recorded specimen was much longer at . The posterior horn is much smaller, usually less than long, and often little more than a knob. The larger nasal horn is also known as the anterior horn; the smaller posterior horn is known as the frontal horn. The horns are dark grey or black in color. The bulls have larger horns than the cows, though the species is not otherwise sexually dimorphic. The Sumatran rhino lives an estimated 30–45 years in the wild, while the record time in captivity is a female &quot;D. lasiotis&quot;, which lived for 32 years and 8 months before dying in the London Zoo in 1900.

Two thick folds of skin encircle the body behind the front legs and before the hind legs. The rhino has a smaller fold of skin around its neck. The skin itself is thin, , and in the wild, the rhino appears to have no subcutaneous fat. Hair can range from dense (the most dense hair in young calves) to scarce, and is usually a reddish brown. In the wild, this hair is hard to observe because the rhinos are often covered in mud. In captivity, however, the hair grows out and becomes much shaggier, likely because of less abrasion from walking through vegetation. The rhino has a patch of long hair around its ears and a thick clump of hair at the end of its tail. Like all rhinos, they have very poor vision. The Sumatran rhinoceros is fast and agile; it climbs mountains easily and comfortably traverses steep slopes and riverbanks.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The Sumatran rhinoceros lives in both lowland and highland secondary rainforest, swamps, and cloud forests. It inhabits hilly areas close to water, particularly steep upper valleys with copious undergrowth. The Sumatran rhinoceros once inhabited a continuous range as far north as Myanmar, eastern India, and Bangladesh. Unconfirmed reports also placed it in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. All known living animals occur in the island of Sumatra. Some conservationists hope Sumatran rhinos may still survive in Burma, though it is considered unlikely. Political turmoil in Burma has prevented any assessment or study of possible survivors. The last reports of stray animals from Indian limits were in the 1990s. Remains of Sumatran rhinoceros have been found in Chinese Neolithic sites of Zhejiang, Henan, Fujian, and the northeastern Tibetan Plateau.

The Sumatran rhino is widely scattered across its range, much more so than the other Asian rhinos, which has made it difficult for conservationists to protect members of the species effectively. Only four areas are known to contain Sumatran rhinoceros: Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Gunung Leuser National Park, and Way Kambas National Park on Sumatra; and on Indonesian Borneo west of Samarindah.

The Kerinci Seblat National Park, Sumatra&#x27;s largest, was estimated to contain a population of around 500 rhinos in the 1980s, but due to poaching, this population is now considered extinct. The survival of any animals in Peninsular Malaysia is extremely unlikely.
Genetic analysis of Sumatran rhino populations has identified three distinct genetic lineages. The channel between Sumatra and Malaysia was not as significant a barrier for the rhinos as the Barisan Mountains along the length of Sumatra, for rhinos in eastern Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia are more closely related than the rhinos on the other side of the mountains in western Sumatra. In fact, the eastern Sumatra and Malaysia rhinos show so little genetic variance, the populations were likely not separate during the Pleistocene, when sea levels were much lower and Sumatra formed part of the mainland. Both populations of Sumatra and Malaysia, however, are close enough genetically that interbreeding would not be problematic. The rhinos of Borneo are sufficiently distinct that conservation geneticists have advised against crossing their lineages with the other populations. Conservation geneticists have recently begun to study the diversity of the gene pool within these populations by identifying microsatellite loci. The results of initial testing found levels of variability within Sumatran rhino populations comparable to those in the population of the less endangered African rhinos, but the genetic diversity of Sumatran rhinos is an area of continuing study.

Although the rhino had been thought to be extinct in Kalimantan since the 1990s, in March 2013 World Wildlife Fund (WWF) announced that the team when monitoring orangutan activity found in West Kutai Regency, East Kalimantan, several fresh rhino foot trails, mud holes, traces of rhino-rubbed trees, traces of rhino horns on the walls of mud holes, and rhino bites on small branches. The team also identified that rhinos ate more than 30 species of plants. On 2 October 2013, video images made with camera traps showing the Sumatran rhino in Kutai Barat, Kalimantan, were released by the World Wildlife Fund. Experts assume the videos show two different animals, but aren&#x27;t quite certain. According to the Indonesia&#x27;s Minister of Forestry, Zulkifli Hasan called the video evidence &quot;very important&quot; and mentioned Indonesia&#x27;s &quot;target of rhino population growth by three percent per year&quot;. On 22 March 2016 it was announced by the WWF that a live Sumatran rhino was found in Kalimantan; it was the first contact in over 40 years. The rhino, a female, was captured and transported to a nearby sanctuary to ensure her survival.

Iman, the last known Sumatran rhino in Malaysia, died in November 2019; stem cell technology is being used in an attempt to revitalize the rhino&#x27;s population and reverse extinction in the country. As of 2023, there has been two births at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary at Way Kambas National Park, Indonesia.

== Behavior and ecology ==

Sumatran rhinos are solitary creatures except for pairing before mating and during offspring rearing. Individuals have home ranges; bulls have territories as large as , whereas cows&#x27; ranges are . The ranges of cows appear to be spaced apart; bulls&#x27; ranges often overlap. No evidence indicates Sumatran rhinos defend their territories through fighting. Marking their territories is done by scraping soil with their feet, bending saplings into distinctive patterns, and leaving excrement. The Sumatran rhino is usually most active when eating, at dawn, and just after dusk. During the day, they wallow in mud baths to cool down and rest. In the rainy season, they move to higher elevations; in the cooler months, they return to lower areas in their range. When mud holes are unavailable, the rhino will deepen puddles with its feet and horns. The wallowing behaviour helps the rhino maintain its body temperature and protect its skin from ectoparasites and other insects. Captive specimens, deprived of adequate wallowing, have quickly developed broken and inflamed skins, suppurations, eye problems, inflamed nails, and hair loss, and have eventually died. One 20-month study of wallowing behavior found they will visit no more than three wallows at any given time. After two to 12 weeks using a particular wallow, the rhino will abandon it. Typically, the rhino will wallow around midday for two to three hours at a time before venturing out for food. Although in zoos the Sumatran rhino has been observed wallowing less than 45 minutes a day, the study of wild animals found 80–300 minutes (an average of 166 minutes) per day spent in wallows.

There has been little opportunity to study epidemiology in the Sumatran rhinoceros. Ticks and gyrostigma were reported to cause deaths in captive animals in the 19th century. The rhino is also known to be vulnerable to the blood disease surra, which can be spread by horse-flies carrying parasitic trypanosomes; in 2004, all five rhinos at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Center died over an 18-day period after becoming infected by the disease. The Sumatran rhino has no known predators other than humans. Tigers and wild dogs may be capable of killing a calf, but calves stay close to their mothers, and the frequency of such killings is unknown. Although the rhino&#x27;s range overlaps with elephants and tapirs, the species do not appear to compete for food or habitat. Asian elephants (&quot;Elephas maximus&quot;) and Sumatran rhinos are even known to share trails, and many smaller species, such as deer, boars, and wild dogs, will use the trails the rhinos and elephants create.

The Sumatran rhino maintains two types of trails across its range. Main trails will be used by generations of rhinos to travel between important areas in the rhino&#x27;s range, such as between salt licks, or in corridors through inhospitable terrain that separates ranges. In feeding areas, the rhinos will make smaller trails, still covered by vegetation, to areas containing food the rhino eats. Sumatran rhino trails have been found that cross rivers deeper than and about across. The currents of these rivers are known to be strong, but the rhino is a strong swimmer. A relative absence of wallows near rivers in the range of the Sumatran rhinoceros indicates they may occasionally bathe in rivers in lieu of wallowing.

=== Diet ===
Most feeding occurs just before nightfall and in the morning. The Sumatran rhino is a folivore, with a diet of young saplings, leaves, twigs, and shoots. The rhinos usually consume up to of food a day. Primarily by measuring dung samples, researchers have identified more than 100 food species consumed by the Sumatran rhinoceros. The largest portion of the diet is tree saplings with a trunk diameter of . The rhinoceros typically pushes these saplings over with its body, walking over the sapling without stepping on it, to eat the leaves. Many of the plant species the rhino consumes exist in only small portions, which indicates the rhino is frequently changing its diet and feeding in different locations. Among the most common plants the rhino eats are many species from the Euphorbiaceae, Rubiaceae, and Melastomataceae families. The most common species the rhino consumes is &quot;Eugenia&quot;.

The vegetal diet of the Sumatran rhinoceros is high in fiber and only moderate in protein. Salt licks are very important to the nutrition of the rhino. These licks can be small hot springs, seepages of salty water, or mud-volcanoes. The salt licks also serve an important social purpose for the rhinos—bulls visit the licks to pick up the scent of cows in oestrus. Some Sumatran rhinos, however, live in areas where salt licks are not readily available, or the rhinos have not been observed using the licks. These rhinos may get their necessary mineral requirements by consuming plants rich in minerals.

=== Communication ===
The Sumatran rhinoceros is the most vocal of the rhinoceros species. Observations of the species in zoos show the animal almost constantly vocalizing, and it is known to do so in the wild, as well. The rhino makes three distinct noises: eeps, &quot;whales&quot;, and whistle-blows. The eep, a short, one-second-long yelp, is the most common sound. The whale, named for its similarity to vocalizations of the humpback whale, is the most song-like vocalization and the second-most common. The whale varies in pitch and lasts from four to seven seconds. The whistle-blow is named because it consists of a two-second-long whistling noise and a burst of air in immediate succession. The whistle-blow is the loudest of the vocalizations, loud enough to make the iron bars in the zoo enclosure where the rhinos were studied vibrate. The purpose of the vocalizations is unknown, though they are theorized to convey danger, sexual readiness, and location, as do other ungulate vocalizations. The whistle-blow could be heard at a great distance, even in the dense brush in which the Sumatran rhino lives. A vocalization of similar volume from elephants has been shown to carry and the whistle-blow may carry as far. The Sumatran rhinoceros will sometimes twist the saplings they do not eat. This twisting behavior is believed to be used as a form of communication, frequently indicating a junction in a trail.

=== Reproduction ===

Cows become sexually mature at the age of six to seven years, while bulls become sexually mature at about 10 years old. The gestation period is around 15–16 months. The calf, which typically weighs , is weaned after about 15 months and stays with its mother for the first two to three years of its life. In the wild, the birth interval for this species is estimated to be four to five years; its natural offspring-rearing behavior is unstudied.

The reproductive habits of the Sumatran rhinoceros have been studied in captivity. Sex relationships begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, urination, and increased physical contact, with both bull and cow using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most similar to that of the black rhinoceros. Young Sumatran rhino bulls are often too aggressive with cows, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the cow could run away from an overly aggressive bull, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive bulls may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.

The period of oestrus itself, when the cow is receptive to the bull, lasts about 24 hours, and observations have placed its recurrence between 21 and 25 days. Sumatran rhinos in the Cincinnati Zoo have been observed copulating for 30–50 minutes, similar in length to other rhinos; observations at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre in Malaysia have shown a briefer copulation cycle. As the Cincinnati Zoo has had successful pregnancies, and other rhinos also have lengthy copulatory periods, a lengthy rut may be the natural behavior. Though researchers observed successful conceptions, all these pregnancies ended in failure for a variety of reasons until the first successful captive birth in 2001; studies of these failures at the Cincinnati Zoo discovered the Sumatran rhino&#x27;s ovulation is induced by mating and it had unpredictable progesterone levels. Breeding success was finally achieved in 2001, 2004, and 2007 by providing a pregnant rhino with supplementary progestin.
In 2016, a calf was born in captivity in western Indonesia, only the fifth such birth in a breeding facility. In March 2022, and 1 October 2023, female calves were born at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary (SRS), as well as a male calf born on 25 November 2023.

== Conservation ==
===In the wild===
Sumatran rhinos were once quite numerous throughout Southeast Asia. Fewer than 100 individuals are now estimated to remain. The species is classed as critically endangered (primarily due to illegal poaching) while the last survey in 2008 estimated that around 250 individuals survived. From the early 1990s, the population decline was estimated at more than 50% per decade, and the small, scattered populations now face high risks of inbreeding depression. Most remaining habitat is in relatively inaccessible mountainous areas of Indonesia.

Poaching of Sumatran rhinos is a cause for concern, due to the high market price of its horns. This species has been overhunted for many centuries, leading to the current greatly reduced and still declining population. The rhinos are difficult to observe and hunt directly (one field researcher spent seven weeks in a treehide near a salt lick without ever observing a rhino directly), so poachers make use of spear traps and pit traps. In the 1970s, uses of the rhinoceros&#x27;s body parts among the local people of Sumatra were documented, such as the use of rhino horns in amulets and a folk belief that the horns offer some protection against poison. Dried rhinoceros meat was used as medicine for diarrhea, leprosy, and tuberculosis. &quot;Rhino oil&quot;, a concoction made from leaving a rhino&#x27;s skull in coconut oil for several weeks, may be used to treat skin diseases. The extent of use and belief in these practices is not known. Rhinoceros horn was once believed to be widely used as an aphrodisiac; in fact traditional Chinese medicine never used it for this purpose. Nevertheless, hunting in this species has primarily been driven by a demand for rhino horns with unproven medicinal properties.
The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia, which the Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for legal and illegal logging because of the desirability of their hardwoods. Rare woods such as merbau, meranti and semaram are valuable on the international markets, fetching as much as $1,800 per m3 ($1,375 per cu yd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws is difficult because humans live within or near many of the same forests as the rhino. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging. Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction, the number of logging permits for these woods has increased dramatically because of the tsunami. However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting, as it can withstand more or less any forest condition.
Nevertheless, the main cause of drastic reduction of the species is likely caused by the Allee effect.

The Bornean rhino in Sabah was confirmed to be extinct in the wild in April 2015, with only 3 individuals left in captivity. The mainland Sumatran rhino in Malaysia was confirmed to be extinct in the wild in August 2015. In March 2016 there was a rare sighting of a Sumatran rhino in East Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo. The last time there was a Sumatran rhino in the Kalimantan area was approximately 40 years ago. This optimism was met with despair as the same rhino named Najaq was found dead several weeks after the sighting. The cause of death was infection on the wound caused by snare.

===In captivity===

Sumatran rhinos do not thrive outside of their ecosystem. London Zoo acquired a bull and cow in 1872 that had been captured in Chittagong in 1868. The female named &quot;Begum&quot; survived until 1900, the record lifetime for a captive rhino. Begum was one of at least seven specimens of the extinct subspecies &quot;D. s. lasiotis&quot; that were held in zoos and circuses. In 1972, Subur, the only Sumatran rhino remaining in captivity, died at the Copenhagen Zoo.

Despite the species&#x27; persistent lack of reproductive success, in the early 1980s, some conservation organizations began a captive-breeding program for the Sumatran rhinoceros. Between 1984 and 1996, this &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation program transported 40 Sumatran rhinos from their native habitats to zoos and reserves across the world. While hopes were initially high, and much research was conducted on the captive specimens, by the late 1990s, not a single rhino had been born in the program, and most of its proponents agreed the program had been a failure. In 1997, the IUCN&#x27;s Asian rhino specialist group, which once endorsed the program, declared it had failed &quot;even maintaining the species within acceptable limits of mortality&quot;, noting that, in addition to the lack of births, 20 of the captured rhinos had died. In 2004, a surra outbreak at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre killed all the captive rhinos in Peninsular Malaysia, reducing the population of captive rhinos to eight.

Seven of these captive rhinos were sent to the United States, and three to Port Lympne Zoo in the United Kingdom (the other was kept in Southeast Asia), but by 1997, their numbers had dwindled to three: a cow in the Los Angeles Zoo, a bull in the Cincinnati Zoo, and a cow in the Bronx Zoo. In a final effort, the three rhinos were united in Cincinnati. After years of failed attempts, the cow from Los Angeles, Emi, became pregnant for the sixth time, with the zoo&#x27;s bull Ipuh. All five of her previous pregnancies ended in failure. Reproductive physiologist at the Cincinnati Zoo, Terri Roth, had learned from previous failures, though, and with the aid of special hormone treatments, Emi gave birth to a healthy male calf named Andalas (an Indonesian literary word for Sumatra) in September 2001. Andalas&#x27;s birth was the first successful captive birth of a Sumatran rhino in 112 years. A female calf, named &quot;Suci&quot; (Indonesian for &quot;pure&quot;), followed on 30 July 2004. On 29 April 2007, Emi gave birth a third time, to her second male calf, named Harapan (Indonesian for &quot;hope&quot;) or Harry. In 2007, Andalas, who had been living at the Los Angeles Zoo, was returned to Sumatra to take part in breeding programs with healthy females, leading to the siring and 23 June 2012 birth of male calf Andatu, the fourth captive-born calf of the era; Andalas had been mated with Ratu, a wild-born cow living in the Rhino Sanctuary at Way Kambas National Park.

Despite the recent successes in Cincinnati, the captive-breeding program has remained controversial. Proponents argue that the zoos have not only aided the conservation effort by studying the reproductive habits, raising public awareness and education about the rhinos, helping raise financial resources for conservation efforts in Sumatra but, moreover, to have established a small captive breeding group. Opponents of the captive breeding program argue that the losses are too great; the program is too expensive; removing rhinos from their habitat, even temporarily, alters their ecological role; and captive populations cannot match the rate of recovery seen in well-protected native habitats. In October 2015, Harapan, the last rhino in the Western Hemisphere, left the Cincinnati Zoo to Indonesia.
In August 2016, there were only three Sumatran rhinos left in Malaysia, all in captivity in the eastern state of Sabah: A bull named Tam and two cows named Puntung and Iman. In June 2017, Puntung was put down due to skin cancer. Tam died on 27 May 2019 and Iman died of cancer on 23 November 2019 at the Borneo Rhino Sanctuary. The species became extinct in Malaysia, its native land in 2019.

In Indonesia, meanwhile, a seventh rhino increased the group at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary, in Way Kambas NP. A female was born on 12 May 2016, named Delilah. Another female, daughter of Andatu and Rosa, was born on 24 March 2022, named Sedah Mirah. A female was born on 30 September 2023, the third child of Andalas-Ratu pair. A male calf was born on 26 November 2023, son of Delilah and Harapan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sukarta/Muklasin 2023 k942&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesian East Kalimantan, only one old (estimated to be 35 to 40 years old) female named Pahu lives in Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary (SRS) Kelian, West Kutai after being captured in 2018, another identified is Pari, a female who lives in the wild in Sungai Ratah-Sungai Nyuatan-Sungai Lawa protected forest. On 31 October 2023, conservationists in Indonesia said they have extracted eggs from Pahu, who were too old and small to breed with the Sumatran subspecies, the eggs are currently planned to be fertilized with sperms from captive male Sumatran rhino before implanted in female Sumatran rhino in SRS Way Kambas.

==Cultural depictions==

Aside from those few individuals kept in zoos and pictured in books, the Sumatran rhinoceros has remained little known, overshadowed by the more common Indian, black and white rhinos. Recently, however, video footage of the Sumatran rhinoceros in its native habitat and in breeding centers has been featured in several nature documentaries. Extensive footage can be found in an Asia Geographic documentary &quot;The Littlest Rhino&quot;. Natural History New Zealand showed footage of a Sumatran rhino, shot by freelance Indonesian-based cameraman Alain Compost, in the 2001 documentary &#x27;
Forgotten Rhino&quot;, which featured mainly Javan and Indian rhinos.

Though they were documented by droppings and tracks, pictures of the Bornean rhinoceros were first taken and widely distributed by modern conservationists in April 2006, when camera traps photographed a healthy adult in the jungles of Sabah in Malaysian Borneo. On 24 April 2007, it was announced that cameras had captured the first-ever video footage of a wild Bornean rhino. The night-time footage showed the rhino eating, peering through jungle foliage, and sniffing the film equipment. The World Wildlife Fund, which took the video, has used it in efforts to convince local governments to turn the area into a rhino conservation zone. Monitoring has continued; 50 new cameras have been set up, and in February 2010, what appeared to be a pregnant rhino was filmed.

A number of folk tales about the Sumatran rhino were collected by colonial naturalists and hunters from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century. In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that the best time to hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the Sumatran rhino&#x27;s horns was hollow and could be used as a sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horns every year and buried them under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.

<doc id="510328" wikidata="Q858432" url="?curid=510328" title="Roronoa Zoro">
<text>, also known as , is a fictional character created by Japanese manga artist Eiichiro Oda who appears in the manga series and media franchise &quot;One Piece&quot;. He first appeared in the third chapter of the &quot;One Piece&quot; manga, published in the manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; in 1997. Zoro is the first crewmate to join Monkey D. Luffy to be part of his crew of pirates, after he is rescued by Luffy from execution. Zoro is a highly skilled swordsman and serves as the crew&#x27;s combatant, though he possesses an extremely poor sense of direction which recurs as a running gag throughout the series.

== Creation and conception ==
Zoro originally used two swords instead of three. Zoro was originally planned to be part of Buggy the Clown’s pirate crew and would have been recruited by Luffy away from Buggy. Zoro&#x27;s surname is based on the Japanese pronunciation of French pirate François l&#x27;Olonnais. In several Western localizations, his name was changed to Zolo.

=== Design ===
Zoro commonly wears a plain white shirt (though he can be seen wearing other types of shirts), black pants, and a light-green, &quot;haramaki&quot; sash that holds his three swords. These sword&#x27;s names are Enma, Wado Ichimonji, and Sandai Kitetsu. Zoro also has a black bandanna tied around his left biceps that he only wears on his head while in a serious battle. Under his shirt, his torso is heavily scarred from many of the battles he has fought, especially since he joined the Straw Hats (like the one acquired during the battle against Dracule Mihawk, one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea). He has three golden earrings in his left ear, which denotes his three swords style. After the two year time-skip, Zoro has a scar across his left eye (obtained during his training under Dracule Mihawk, although not confirmed by anime) and replaces his shirt with a long dark green samurai&#x27;s coat which he can even open the torso while fighting (against the New Fishman Pirates) or when he experiences heat (burning side of Punk Hazard). Concerning his ethnic appearance, Oda revealed that he imagines Zoro to be of Japanese descent, albeit in a real-world context.

Zoro has many scars on his body. The most noticeable is the long scar running down his left eye, which is the one he got after returning from the two-year time skip. It is currently unknown how he acquired it, but he either can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t open his left eye because of it. 
He also has a heavily scarred torso, having a diagonal cut mark from the top left to the bottom right of his torso due to fighting Dracule Mihawk. He also has scars on both of his ankles, which he obtained from trying to cut his own legs off to escape the candle prison of Mr. 3 in Little Garden.

=== Portrayals ===
In the original Japanese version of the &quot;One Piece&quot; anime series, Zoro is voiced by Kazuya Nakai as an adult and Megumi Urawa as a child. In the first OVA &quot;Defeat Him! The Pirate Ganzack&quot; from 1998 is voiced by Wataru Takagi.

In Odex&#x27;s dubs of the first 104 episodes of &quot;One Piece&quot; in Singapore, Zoro was voiced by Brian Zimmerman. In the 4kids Entertainment&#x27;s dub of the first 104 episodes of &quot;One Piece&quot;, Zoro was renamed &quot;Zolo,&quot; which was later influenced and implemented in the Viz Media adaption of the manga series; he was voiced by Marc Diraison and Andrew Rannells as a child. In Funimation Entertainment&#x27;s dubs of the entire &quot;One Piece&quot; franchise, adult Zoro is voiced by Christopher Sabat with Cynthia Cranz playing the role of child Zoro for episode 2 and by Brina Palencia for the rest of the franchise. Sabat compared Zoro&#x27;s characterization with &quot;&quot;″s Kurogane and &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;″s Kazuma Kuwabara, describing them as &quot;the tough guy with a heart of gold&quot;. As a result, Sabat feared that he sometimes performs similar voices despite the fact the characters are different. He also tried seeing the original actors&#x27; works to avoid getting a more specific delivery. In the game &quot;One Piece: Unlimited Adventure&quot;, Sabat reprises his role as adult Zoro, with child Zoro voiced by Aaron Dismuke.

Zoro is portrayed by Mackenyu in the live action adaptation of &quot;One Piece&quot;, while Maximilian Lee Piazza portrays young Zoro.

Zoro is confident but often acts in a very comical manner. A running gag is that he has a terrible sense of direction (being capable of getting lost even while walking in a straight line) which he is very insecure about since he never admits when he gets lost, instead always blaming someone else. While the crew is out at sea, Zoro can (usually) be found sleeping or training towards his goal of becoming the world&#x27;s best swordsman. He and Sanji have a great rivalry, often resorting to fighting (both verbally and physically) over issues from minor to extreme. Zoro had never called Sanji by his name in the original Japanese manga, he uses phrases like &quot;dumb-cook&quot;, etc. On the other side, Sanji uses phrases like &quot;marimo&quot; (moss-head). etc.

Though not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of &quot;bushido&quot; and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat Pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood. It is shown that Zoro enjoys fighting a strong opponent (usually left to face down the second strongest villain in each arc, as Luffy faces down the strongest). Zoro tends to retain a maniacal grin and serious glare when battling a worthy opponent.

===Personality===
Zoro has a stern, serious, and distanced personality, but unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his short-tempered and impatient attitude. In contrast to Sanji&#x27;s principle of treating women gently, Zoro considers women strong and tough. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength and maintaining a lookout in the ship&#x27;s crow&#x27;s nest (which on the Thousand Sunny ship also doubles as his gym). He also likes &quot;sake&quot;, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger and react. He is often displayed as being well aware of dangerous situations and the people around him.

Despite his stern personality, Zoro had a strong sense of loyalty and mutual respect towards his crewmates when accomplishing their dreams. After his humiliating loss to Dracule Mihawk, Zoro pledged his loyalty to Luffy as his captain vowing that he will never lose again. As Luffy&#x27;s first mate, Zoro often reminds others of the harsh reality of a sudden situation, which shocks some other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. It can be seen when Luffy and Usopp have a fight and Usopp leaves the crew, Zoro says that Luffy is the ship&#x27;s captain and everyone must respect him without any exception so Usopp must apologize to Luffy before he joins the crew. He also added that if Luffy takes in Usopp without his apology to Luffy then the next one leaving the crew will be Zoro himself. Later everyone understood him and decided that Zoro was right about it. Zoro has stated that he does not pray to any god, does not care one way or the other, and has never believed in anything except himself, and for him, only one man is above him (his captain, Luffy). He has also stated that he would follow Luffy till the end of his journey - becoming the King of the Pirates - but Luffy should not come between him and his dream either - becoming the world&#x27;s strongest Swordsman (currently: Dracule Mihawk). Even so, Zoro knows he still has much-untapped potential and is constantly seen training and improving his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master&#x27;s code of honor and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is vigorous, strong-willed, and determined.

====Haki====
He is proficient in Armament and Observation Haki and is one of the few known characters who possess Conquerors Haki. During his battle against King, Zoro unlocks an advanced form of Conqueror Haki, which allows him to coat his swords with it, similar to Armament Haki, which could further enhance his attacks. Although it hasn&#x27;t been confirmed, Zoro is heavily linked with conqueror Haki by the beast pirate captain himself after the wound he gave to him. He also uses an advanced form of Armament Haki to shoot a short blast of Haki from a distance.

==Appearances==
===&quot;One Piece&quot; manga===
Roronoa Zoro first appears in the manga chapter , first published in Japan&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine on August 18, 1997. He first appears as a captured criminal awaiting his execution at the hands of the Marines. Before the beginning of the series&#x27; narrative, Zoro loses his childhood friend Kuina and vows to become the strongest swordsman in the world. For years, Zoro hunts pirates as a bounty hunter only to get money for food in the company of his friends Johnny and Yosaku. Zoro initially did this because he got lost seeking to face the best swordsman in the world, Dracule Mihawk. When Luffy offers Zoro the opportunity to join his crew, Zoro initially refuses. But after Luffy saves him from execution, Zoro pledges loyalty to him. Zoro is later easily defeated at Mihawk&#x27;s hands at the Baratie restaurant and pledges to Luffy that he would never lose again.

Zoro&#x27;s loyalty to Luffy is incomparable among the crew and develops through the series. Even though he joined Luffy&#x27;s crew, his main goal was to become the strongest swordsman. Originally Zoro threatened to kill Luffy if he ever got in the way of this goal. He listens to his captain&#x27;s order and follows the order until the very end. On Jaya, Zoro followed Luffy&#x27;s orders not to fight an enemy in a bar no matter what and followed it without hesitation. In &quot;Water 7,&quot; Zoro upholds the authority of Luffy as captain during Luffy&#x27;s fight with Usopp and Usopp&#x27;s leaving of the crew. Zoro pointedly refuses to allow Usopp to rejoin the crew without an apology and threatens to be the next to leave because to let Usopp &quot;back as if nothing happened was an insult to Luffy&#x27;s authority as captain. He even slapped Luffy with the reality that being a pirate isn&#x27;t a game.&quot;

On the next island, Thriller Bark, Bartholomew Kuma confronted a knocked-out Luffy and the Straw Hats and asked the protagonists to surrender Luffy. Everyone refused, and Kuma knocked everyone out except for Zoro, Sanji, and Brook. Zoro offers to sacrifice his life for Luffy, proclaiming that Luffy will be the man to become Pirate King. Sanji also offers his life, but Zoro knocks out Sanji to save his life. Zoro begs Kuma not to take Luffy and to take him instead. Zoro told Kuma that he is even willing to give up his dream of becoming the world&#x27;s greatest swordsman for Luffy&#x27;s dream. After seeing this, Kuma agreed to Zoro instead of taking Zoro with him. Kuma asked to take all Luffy&#x27;s pain after fighting Gecko Moria. Zoro&#x27;s dream in the entire series was to become the world&#x27;s greatest swordsman, but he is willing to give that up for Luffy, showing how loyal Zoro grew to his captain after initially threatening to end Luffy&#x27;s life for threatening his dream.

After fighting Daz Bonez in Alabasta, Zoro&#x27;s bounty is initially set at 60,000,000 but is later raised to 120,000,000 after fighting the World Government at Enies Lobby. Later, the crew is separated by Bartholomew Kuma, which resulted in pre and post-time skips. Zoro encounters Mihawk again and trains under him for two years before reuniting with the crew. He receives a bounty of 320,000,000 after cutting up an antagonist as large as a mountain and assisting Luffy at the end of Don Quixote Doflamingo&#x27;s tyrannical rule. After the events in Wano Country and his contributions in the Onigashima Raid such as defeating King, he receives a bounty of 1,111,000,000.

In &quot;One Piece&quot; volume 105, Oda revealed Zoro&#x27;s family history. His father, Roronoa Arashi, was killed by pirates and his mother, Tera, died of illness when he was young. Zoro is a descendant of the Shimotsuki family of Wano Country through his grandmother Furiko, the older sister of Ushimaru, the daimyo of Ringo who is Zoro&#x27;s great-uncle. Zoro is related to Kuina as distant cousins and is the descendant of Shimotsuki Ryuma.

===In other media===
Zoro has made several appearances in other media, including, but not limited to, every &quot;One Piece&quot; licensed electronic video game to date, including &quot;Jump Super Stars&quot; and &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot;. In 2006, he is featured in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;/&quot;One Piece&quot;/&quot;Naruto&quot; crossover game &quot;Battle Stadium D.O.N.&quot;.

Zoro appears in a special episode of One Piece X Toriko, fighting Zebra and Vegeta, Zoro appears lost, searching for his crew, until Zebra appears to Zoro, and Vegeta appears searching for Goku to &quot;settle the score&quot;, the three were furious and fought without end.

== Reception==
Zoro is always among the top three most popular characters, usually only below Luffy in popularity. He ranked second in every &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot; character popularity poll except the fifth, where he ranked third after Trafalgar Law. Furthermore, in a 2007 poll by Oricon, Zoro was voted as the 4th most desired character to receive a spinoff. DVD Talk praises Zoro&#x27;s &quot;hilarious&quot; three-sword fighting style as a great example of the show&#x27;s sense of humor. Holly Ellingwood from Activeanime praised Zoro&#x27;s fight against Luffy as one of the best moments from the 10th DVD from the series released by Viz Media, praising the action scenes. Sabat&#x27;s work with Zoro has resulted in him being nominated in the category &quot;Best Voice Actor (English)&quot; in the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation (SPJA) Awards from 2008. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network commented on Sabat&#x27;s work with Zoro as a &quot;standout&quot;, noting that Zoro and Sabat are &quot;well-matched. Kimlinger also found that his and Sanji&#x27;s flashbacks from the anime &quot;really do jerk tears, even if they are less than gracefully executed&quot;.

When Nico Robin refers to the two as the &quot;Wings of the Pirate King,&quot; it &quot;suggests that they&#x27;re the two most important people to Luffy becoming the Pirate King, for their ability to carry their responsibility effectively and fight at the highest level, if not more.&quot;

<doc id="510330" wikidata="Q115674" url="?curid=510330" title="Jack Finney">
<text>Walter Braden &quot;Jack&quot; Finney (born John Finney; October 2, 1911 – November 14, 1995) was an American writer. His best-known works are science fiction and thrillers, including &quot;The Body Snatchers&quot; and &quot;Time and Again&quot;. The former was the basis for the 1956 film &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; and its remakes.

==Personal life==
Finney was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and given the name John Finney. After his father died when Finney was three years old, he was renamed Walter Braden Finney in honor of his father, but continued to be known as &quot;Jack&quot;. He attended Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, graduating in 1934. He married Marguerite Guest, and they had two children, Kenneth and Marguerite. After living in New York City and working for an advertising agency there, he moved with his family to California in the early 1950s. He lived in Mill Valley, California, and died of pneumonia and emphysema in Greenbrae, California, at the age of 84.

== Writing career ==
Finney&#x27;s first article, &quot;Someone Who Knows Told Me …&quot;, published in the December 1943 issue of Cosmopolitan, reflects the message of the Office of War Information&#x27;s (OWI) &quot;Loose Lips Sink Ships&quot; campaign of World War II. As an advertising copywriter, Finney was doing his part, driving home the point that careless remarks by otherwise patriotic citizens can aid enemy agents, resulting in the death of US servicemen.

His story &quot;The Widow&#x27;s Walk&quot; won a contest sponsored by &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; in 1946. His first novel, &quot;5 Against the House&quot;, was published in 1954. It was made into a movie the following year.

Finney&#x27;s novel &quot;The Body Snatchers&quot; (1955) was the basis for the 1956 movie &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; and multiple remakes.

Another novel, &quot;Assault on a Queen&quot; (1959), became the film &quot;Assault on a Queen&quot; with Frank Sinatra as the leader of a gang that pulls a daring robbery of the RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot;.

Finney&#x27;s greatest success came with his science fiction novel &quot;Time and Again&quot; (1970). It involves time travel to the past, a theme he had experimented with previously in short stories. Its protagonist, Simon Morley, is working in advertising in New York City when he is recruited for a secret government project to achieve time travel. Morley travels to the New York City of 1882. The novel is notable for Finney&#x27;s vivid and detailed picture of life in the city at that time and for the art and photographs supposedly made by Morley during his experiences, which are reproduced in the pages of the novel. Morley sees many actual historical sites, some now gone (e.g., the post office that, until 1939, stood in what is now the southern tip of City Hall Park) and some still existing (e.g., St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, then the tallest building in its Fifth Avenue neighborhood).

In 1987, Finney was given the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement at the World Fantasy Convention, held in Nashville, Tennessee.

Finney&#x27;s story &quot;Such Interesting Neighbors&quot; (&quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, 6 January 1951) was the basis for the second episode of &quot;Science Fiction Theatre&quot;, entitled &quot;Time Is Just a Place&quot;. It was first broadcast on 16 April 1955. It co-starred Don DeFore and Warren Stevens; it was then published in 1957, in the collection &quot;The Third Level&quot; by Rhinehart and Company; later, the story appeared as an episode of the Steven Spielberg-created anthology series &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, starring Adam Ant and Marcia Strassman. Spielberg&#x27;s version was first broadcast on 20 March 1987.

In 1995, twenty-five years after &quot;Time and Again&quot;, Finney published a sequel called &quot;From Time to Time&quot; featuring the further adventures of Morley, this time centering on Manhattan in 1912. Finney died at the age of 84 not long after finishing the book.

The 1998 television movie &quot;The Love Letter&quot;, starring Campbell Scott and Jennifer Jason Leigh, is based on Finney&#x27;s short story of the same name, which appeared in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1959.

&quot;The Third Level&quot;, Knox College&#x27;s science fiction and fantasy publication, is named for Finney&#x27;s short story &quot;The Third Level&quot;, published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; in October 1952.

<text>Purandara Dasa (IAST: Purandara Dāsa; (1470 – 1564) was a composer, singer and a Haridasa philosopher from present-day Karnataka, India. He was a follower of Madhvacharya&#x27;s Dvaita philosophy. He was one of the chief founding proponents of Carnatic music. In honor of his contributions to Carnatic music, he is referred to as the &quot;Pitamaha&quot; (&quot;lit&quot;. &quot;grandsire&quot;) of Carnatic music. According to a legend, he is considered as an incarnation of Narada.

Purandara Dasa was a wealthy merchant of gold, silver and other miscellaneous jewellery from Karnataka, who gave away all his material riches to become a Haridasa (literally meaning a servant of Vishnu or Krishna), a devotional singer who made the difficult Sanskrit tenets of Bhagavata Purana available to everyone in simple and melodious songs. He was one of the most important music scholars of medieval India. He formulated the basic lessons of teaching Carnatic music by structuring graded exercises known as &quot;Svaravalis&quot; and &quot;Alankaras&quot;, and at the same time, he introduced the &quot;raga&quot; Mayamalavagowla as the first scale to be learnt by beginners in the field – a practice that is still followed today. He also composed &quot;Gitas&quot; (simple songs) for novice students.

Purandara Dasa is noted for composing &quot;Dasa Sahithya&quot;, as a Bhakti movement vocalist, and a music scholar. His younger contemporary, Kanakadasa, emulated his practice. Purandara Dasa&#x27;s Carnatic music compositions are mostly in Kannada, though some are in Sanskrit. He signed his compositions with the &quot;ankitanama&quot; (pen name) &quot;Purandara Vittala&quot; (Vittala is another name of Vishnu) and this same form of Vishnu is his &quot;aaradhya daiva&quot; or &quot;ishta murthi&quot; or worshippable deity. His work was appreciated by many scholars of his time and later scholars.

==Biography==
Inscriptional evidence suggests Purandara Dasa was born to a diamond merchant in a Kannada Deshastha Madhva Brahmin family in 1470, in Purandara gada,18 kms far from pune present-day Maharashtra state. According to other opinions, his native town was Purandaraghatta in Karnataka, or Purandaragad near Pune, but the latter is considered a historical mistake – connecting his &quot;pen name&quot; (his &quot;ankita&quot;) with a location that mainly served as a military encampment in the 15th and 16th century. In 2018, a five-member committee set up by the Government of Karnataka to ascertain the birthplace of Purandara Dasa has submitted its report asserting Tirthahalli as the likeliest candidate. The committee included veteran singer and musicologist RK Padmanabha, scholars Aralumallige Parthasarathi, AV Navada, Veeranna Rajora, and former minister Leeladevi Navada. It is now ascertained that Purandharadasa was born in Araga, Vijayanagara Empire (Modern Day Thirthahalli, Shivamogga District, Karnataka, India), Karnataka

Purandara Dasa was the only son of the wealthy merchant Varadappa Nayaka and his wife Rukmini. He was named Srinivasa Nayaka, after the patron deity of Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala. He acquired proficiency in Kannada, Sanskrit, and sacred music through education. At the age of 16, he was married to Saraswati Bai, traditionally described as a pious young girl. They had four sons, Varadappa, Gururaya, Abhinavappa and Madhvapati. He lost his parents at age 20, thereby inheriting his father&#x27;s business of gemstones and pawning. He prospered and became known as &quot;Navakoti Narayana&quot; (an abundantly rich man; worth ninety million).

Popular legend narrates a miraculous incident in Srinivasa Nayaka&#x27;s life, owing to which he was led to devote himself to the practice, propagation and inculcation of &quot;bhakti&quot; (devotion) towards Krishna through musical compositions. As a consequence of the event, he is believed to have relinquished his former greedy and miserly self having realized the worthlessness of attachment to worldly possessions: Per this version, the deity in a bid to cure Srinivaasa of his tenacious materialistic delusion and attachment and thereby claim his devotion to himself, approached Srinivaasa in the guise of a poor man. In this guise the deity is said to have made a piteous plea to Srinivasa for money to perform his son&#x27;s &#x27;upanayana&#x27;(sacred-thread investiture ceremony).

Having been summarily rejected, mocked and turned out, the &#x27;poor man&#x27; repeated his plea before Srinivaasa&#x27;s wife who per the legend was a generous soul of rigorous spiritual nature. She gave away one of her precious nose rings, unbeknownst to her husband. The &#x27;poor man&#x27; sold the nose ring back to Srinivasa himself. The shrewd Srinivasa, privy to his wife&#x27;s openhandedness, immediately identified the nose ring as his wife&#x27;s and hurried home. He was enraged and anxious to ascertain the truth of the matter. He demanded his wife to produce the nose ring before him immediately.

Realizing that Srinivaasa had grown wise to her secret donation, the wife decided to end her life with poison. Having completed her prayers to Vishnu before her attempt, she was shocked to see a nose ring inside the poison cup – completely identical to the one she had just given away. Incredulous and rapturous, she recounted the entire episode to her husband, who was bewildered and lost. Meanwhile, a search for the &#x27;poor man&#x27; was of no avail; he had as mysteriously vanished as he had appeared.

Per legend at that very moment, Srinivaasa became convinced of the inscrutable ways of Vishnu because of having witnessed the unfailing grace that saved his pious wife. He is said to have become bewildered at the power that could produce a gold ornament in a moment by mere will and is said to have instantly shook off the beginning-less, persistent veil in the form of &#x27;I&#x27; and &#x27;mine&#x27; which is believed to mask men&#x27;s vision of the divine. At 30 years of age he gave away all his wealth in charity, and with his family he abandoned his house to lead the life of a mendicant. They start living on alms and singing the glories of Vishnu. In his first song composition, he laments his wasted life of indulgence. It begins with the words &quot;Ana lae kara&quot; in the Shuddha Saveri raga, set to Triputa tala.

In the course of his wandering, he met the sage Vyasatirtha, one of the chief exponents of Madhwa philosophy and the &quot;Rajaguru&quot; of Krishnadevaraya, emperor of the Vijayanagara Empire. According to Prof. Sambamoorthy, Srinivasa had his formal initiation at the hands of Vyasatirtha in 1525 when he was about 40 years old, with the name Purandara Daasa bestowed on him. Purandara Daasa travelled through the length and breadth of the Vijayanagara Empire and Pandharapur in Maharashtra composing and rendering soul-stirring songs in praise of God. He spent his last years in Hampi and also sang songs in Krishnadevaraya&#x27;s court. The mantapa (mandap) in which he stayed is known as Purandara Daasa Mantapa (mandap) in Hampi. He died on 2 January 1564 at the age of 95. Within a short period after his death, the Vijayanagara Empire collapsed. Tradition and legend hold that he composed keerthanas (songs). Further, according to this legend, his original desire was to compose 500,000 keerthanas. Being unable to do it in his present life, he requested his younger son to complete them. His son Madhwapathi told his father that he could do this in his next janma (birth). It is believed that he was reborn as the famous Vijayadasa—birthplace is Cheekalparvi village near Maanvi town, Raichur district in Karnataka State—and completed the remaining 25 thousand keerthanas as promised. Most of his songs are in praise of Vishnu and other divinities. Due to this, he is believed to be an avatar of Narada, the celestial singer and son of goddess Saraswati. One of the &quot;Trimurtis&quot; (three icons) of Carnatic music, Saint Tyagaraja, has paid tribute to Purandara Dasa in his &quot;geya natakam&quot; (an opera) Prahlada Bhakti Vijayam.

==Dating==
Purandara Dasa&#x27;s year of demise is 1564 as given by his son Madhvapati and this is well recorded. But his year of birth is unknown. Several different dates have been proposed by various scholars, authors and historians. B. N. K. Sharma in his book History of Dvaita Vedanta which was published in 1960, wrote year of birth of Purandara Dasa as 1484 based on his own logic and in later reprints he changed this year to 1494. But many scholars, authors and historians have different opinions on this. Authors Guy L. Beck of University of South Carolina and William Joseph Jackson of Oxford University gave dates as 1480-1564 CE. Prominent scholar Amaresh Datta, the chief editor of the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature&quot; published by Sahitya Akademi in this book he gave Purandara Dasa dates as 1480-1564. But based on the historical event of Purandara Dasa meeting Annamacharya and the keerthanas (spiritual songs) that they have sung together on Sri Venkateshwara Swamy at Tirumala, which were recorded by Annamacharya&#x27;s grandson Tallapaka Chinanna, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams gave year of birth of Purandara as 1470.

===Dates based on Purandara Dasa meeting Annamacharya===
Most of the authors or scholars have not taken the historical event of Purandara Dasa meeting Annamacharya and both singing sankeerthanas (devotional songs) on Sri Venkateshwara Swamy at Tirumala into consideration while decided the dates. But based on the manuscripts found, which were written by Tallapaka Chinanna, the grandson of Annamacharya Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams gave it&#x27;s analysis. Based on these manuscripts, Purandara Dasa met Annamacharya after taking Haridasa initiation from Vyasatirtha in Hampi when he was 30 years old and Annamacharya was in his 90&#x27;s. After meeting both Purandara Dasa and Annamacharya sang songs in front of Sri Venkateshwara Swamy in Tirumala temple. Based on these historical recorded events the scholars of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams did analysis and finally declared that Purandara Dasa met Annamacharya in the year 1500 and the year of birth of Purandara Dasa as 1470.

R. Sri Hari, the Vice Chancellor of Dravidian University in his book, &quot;Major Genres and Trends in Dravidian Literature: Classical&quot;, in 2003 also published about this historical event as follows, &quot;The meeting of Annamayya and Purandaradasa as narrated by Tallapaka Chinnanna was a historical fact which heralded a new phase in the evolution of the Padakavita Paddhati in the south, into Karnataka Sangīta Paddhati on one hand and the Bhajana Sampradaya Paddhati on the other&quot;.

==Father of Karnataka (aka carnatic) music==
Purandara Dasa systematized the method of teaching Karnataka Sangita (Carnatic music) which is followed to the present day. He introduced the raga &quot;Mayamalavagowla&quot; as the basic scale for music instruction and fashioned a series of graded lessons such as , , , , , , , , and &quot;kritis&quot;. Another contribution was the fusion of &quot;bhava&quot;, &quot;raga&quot;, and &quot;laya&quot; in his compositions. He included comments on ordinary daily life and elements of colloquial language in his lyrics. He introduced folk ragas into the mainstream, setting his lyrics to ragas of his day so that even a common man could learn and sing them. He also composed several &quot;lakshya&quot; and &quot;lakshana geetas&quot;, many of which are sung to this day. His &quot;sooladis&quot; are regarded as musical masterpieces and are the standard for &quot;raga lakshana&quot;. Scholars attribute the standardization of entirely to Purandara Dasa.

Travelling Haridasa successors are said to have followed the systems he devised, and orally transmitted his compositions. According to traditional sources, his compositions numbers as many as 4,75,000. His original collection of songs is referred to as &quot;Purandaropanishat&quot; as given by Vyasatirtha out of which only 1000 are available right now.

Shri.Dasa was a &quot;vaggeyakara&quot; (composer-performer), a &quot;lakshanakara&quot; (musicologist), and the founder of musical pedagogy. Musicologists call him the &quot;Sangeeta Pitamaha&quot; (lit. &quot;grandfather&quot;) of Karnataka (Carnatic) music.

==Social reforms==
Purandara Dasa tried to reform existing social practices and preached through devotional songs in the local Kannada language. Most of his keertanas deal with social reform and pinpoint the defects in society. The philosophy of Purandara Dasa is harmonious with the concept of &quot;bhakti&quot; in Hinduism, broadly based on the &quot;Narada Bhakti Sutras&quot; and essentially synchronous with the pan-Indian Bhakti movement. It teaches complete self-surrender and unadulterated love towards God. The philosophy of Bhakti in Purandara Dasa&#x27;s compositions stems from the essential teachings of the realistic-pluralistic Madhva Philosophy of Vaishnavism, and has been rendered in simple Kannada. The individual soul (&quot;jeeva&quot;) is a &quot;pratibimba&quot; (reflection) of God (&quot;Vishnu/Ishvara&quot;), who is the &quot;bimba&quot; (source). The &quot;jeeva&quot; owes its existence, knowledge and bliss to the &quot;Ishvara&quot;, and any sense of independence with regards to one&#x27;s actions and the results thereof is to be given up. The mind has to be turned away from transient pleasures and possessions of this world; instead, it is to be turned towards Vishnu, who alone is the abode of unadulterated, unswerving bliss. His &quot;keerthanas&quot; have simple lessons in this regard and implore men to lead the noble life of a &quot;Vaishnava&quot;.

===Casteism===
Purandara Dasa fought the evils of casteism through his songs. In his song &quot;aavakulavaadarenu aavanadarenu aatma bhavavariyada mele&quot; he wonders what is the use if one does not understand the spirit of humanism whatever caste or status one might be accredited to. In the same song when relating to cows of different colours and sugarcane of different shapes he emphasizes that one&#x27;s birth cannot merely decide the highness or lowness of any individual. He asks will the sweetness of crooked sugarcane be also crooked or will the milk of cows of many a colour be also of many colours. He asked people to do their best in the world, to provide food and charity to the poor, help others and give up attachments. He was against the caste system, and believed true caste was based on character, not on birth. Sacrifice did not imply the slaughter of animals, but the slaying of one&#x27;s bad qualities.

===Gender equality===
According to Purandara Dasa, there were no inequalities among men and women. Both of them had the same rights and obligations in their conduct of everyday life as well as observation of piety. Purandara Dasa distinctly described the quality of a virtuous woman. According to him, the neck chains, bangles and other ornaments that women wore were not important; the beauty of mind and noble conduct were her true embellishments.

===Untouchability===
Purandara Dasa made some forceful expressions on untouchability, which was dogging society. His strength comes perhaps from the support of his guru Vyasathirtha with the backing of king Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagara himself. In one such song &quot;Holaya horagithane oorolagillave&quot; he opines that an individual should not be branded untouchable based on his/her birth in any specific caste, however it is rather his conduct which should make him untouchable if at all he can be called so. The usage of the word untouchable is not used in the limited context of physical contact with the person, it is the worthlessness of the association with that person which is highlighted here. This is evident by the subsequent expressions in the song which says that one who does not practice self-discipline is untouchable, one who plots against his government is untouchable, one who shirks charity while having wealth is untouchable, one who poisons to eliminate his opponents is untouchable, one who does not use soft language is untouchable, one who prides over his purity of caste is untouchable and finally one who does not meditate on Purandara Vittala is untouchable. Dasa&#x27;s message is loud and clear rejecting untouchability in our society. He uses the name of Purandara Vittala to imply any God. This is evident from his other songs on various Gods and Goddesses. Similar ideas were expressed by many other poets also.

==Legacy and depictions in popular culture==
===In contemporary music===

In the pure Carnatic tradition, Bidaram Krishnappa was one of the foremost singers of modern times to popularize the compositions of Purandara Dasa. Singer Madras Lalithangi, and her illustrious daughter Padmavibushan, Sangeetha Kalanidhi M. L. Vasanthakumari have rendered yeoman service in propagating the compositions of Purandara Dasa; both were considered authorities on Purandara Dasa. M. L. Vasantha Kumari was awarded an honorary doctorate by Mysore University for her contributions to Purandara Dasa&#x27;s music.

Though the compositions of Purandara Dasa are originally in the &quot;ragas&quot; of the Carnatic system of music, his compositions have been adopted and made equally popular in Hindustani music. Hindustani music legends such as Bhimsen Joshi, Madhav Gudi and Basavaraj Rajguru have made them more popular in recent years.

Classical vocalists and musicians such as Upendra Bhat, Puttur Narasimha Nayak, Venkatesh Kumar, Nagaraja Rao Havaldar, Ganapathi Bhatt, Vidyabhushana, Pravin Godkhindi, Nachiketa Sharma, Sangeetha Katti, and the Bombay Sisters are continuing the tradition of singing and performing Purandara Dasa&#x27;s compositions and other Dasa Sahitya songs in Carnatic as well as Hindustani music concerts. Of late, Mysore Ramachandracharya is industriously propagating dasa sahitya through his concerts. Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams is also propagating the dasa krithis through the Dasa Sahitya Project. He also composed the first lullaby songs in Carnatic music, such as &quot;Thoogire Rangana&quot; and &quot;Gummana Kareyadire&quot;, which led to the creation of many similar songs by others.

===Memorials and monuments===

The Purandara Mantapa adjoining the Vijayavittala temple at Hampi is one of the long-standing monuments relating to Purandara Dasa. This is where he is said to have composed and sung in praise of Vishnu.

Purandara Dasa is said to have composed his well-known song, ‘&quot;Aadisidaleshoda jagadoddharana&quot;’ on infant Sri Krishna, in &quot;raga Kapi&quot;, at the Aprameyaswamy temple in Doddamallur, Channapattana taluk, Karnataka. A small &quot;mantapa&quot; outside the temple is named after him, where he is said to have stayed as he passed through the village.

A statue of Purandara Dasa has been erected at the foothills of Tirumala in Alipiri. A statue of Purandara Dasa adorns the Asthana Mandapam (auditorium) on the Tirumala hill.

A huge statue of Purandara Dasaru is erected at the holy premises of Uttaradi Matha,Bangalore

Sri Purandara Dasa Memorial Trust (SPDMT), formed in Bangalore in 2007, has been actively involved in promoting and researching all aspects of the life and works of Purandara Dasa. A 3500-square-foot concert hall, called &#x27;Purandara Mantapa&#x27;, has been erected on the premises of the Trust.

The Indiranagar Sangeetha Sabha (ISS) at Indiranagar, Bangalore formed in 1986, has dedicated an auditorium with a seating capacity of 600 called Purandara Bhavana exclusively for cultural events, inaugurated by Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, to his memory.

===Salutations===
* On 14 January 1964, the India Security Press – Department of Posts had issued a stamp in honour of Purandarasa Dasa on his 400th death anniversary.
* Tirupati Tirumala Devasthanam has propagated and popularised the literature of Purandara Dasa under the Dasa Sahitya Project.

=== Biographical movies and documentaries ===

Three biographical films, in the Kannada language, have been made on the life and compositions of Purandara Dasa.
* &quot;Purandaradasa&quot; (1937)
* &quot;Navakoti Narayana&quot; (1964)
* &quot;Sri Purandara Dasaru&quot; (1967)
* Film director and playwright Girish Karnad made a documentary film titled &quot;Kanaka-Purandara&quot; (English, 1988) on the two medieval Bhakti poets of Karnataka.

===Aradhana===

&quot;Aradhana&quot; is a religious-devotional observation, held annually, to remember and honor saintly persons on the anniversary of the completion of their earthly lives. Purandara Dasa&#x27;s &quot;aradhana&quot; or &quot;punyadina&quot; is held on the &quot;pushya bahula amavasya&quot; of the Indian &quot;Chandramana&quot; calendar (a new moon day, generally in February–March). Musicians and art aficionados in the state of Karnataka, South India and many art and religious centres around the world observe this occasion with religious and musical fervour. His compositions are sung by established and upcoming artists on this day.

In 2022, aradhanas are happening in India and around the world even to this day.

<text>John Walter Beardsley Tewksbury (March 21, 1876 – April 24, 1968) was an American track and field athlete. At the 1900 Summer Olympics, he won five medals, including two golds.

==Biography==
Born in Ashley, Pennsylvania, Tewksbury studied for a dental degree at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1899. Running for the university team, he won the IC4A titles in the 110 and 220 y in 1898 and 1899.

After graduating in 1899, he headed for Paris to compete in the Olympic Games. Tewksbury entered in 5 events, but had strong competition, among others from fellow Penn student Alvin Kraenzlein. In the 100 m, Tewksbury equalled the world record in the semi-finals, but placed second in the final to Frank Jarvis. The following day, he took another second place, behind Kraenzlein, in the 60 m, before entering the 400 m hurdles.

At the time, this event had probably never been contested in the United States, but Tewksbury easily beat the local favourite for the 400 m hurdles title. The event was quite different from present day, as the hurdles were actually telephone poles laid over the track, and the final hurdles was a water barrier (like in the steeplechase). In the final of the 200 m hurdles, he placed third (with Kraenzlein the winner). The final of the 200 m was held a week later; in that race Tewksbury won his second individual Olympic gold, finishing immediately ahead of Norman Pritchard of India.

Tewksbury retired from sports to open a dental practice in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania, in 1913. He died there on April 24, 1968.

<text>Janina Maria Stronski (born June 7, 1946), known professionally as Jenny Jones, is a Canadian television presenter and comedian who is best known for hosting &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot;.

==Early life==
Janina Maria Stronski was born on June 7, 1946, in Bethlehem, Palestine, to John Stronski, a World War II veteran, and Zosia &quot;Sophie&quot;, a dressmaker. The family, who also had an older daughter, Helena Elizabeth (born 1944), briefly moved to Italy, before relocating to London, Ontario, in 1948. A strict Catholic household, the impoverished family ran a bridal shop. Upon her parents&#x27; divorce, Jones, her mother, and sister moved to Montreal. Disheartened by her mother&#x27;s alcoholism and verbal abuse, Jones began &quot;shoplifting, drinking and necking with guys that we just picked up.&quot; Jones ran away from home at 11 years old; after one month, Jones was arrested for shoplifting and returned to her mother. Jones&#x27;s mother subsequently sent her and Helena back to London to live with their father. As a teenager, Jones began to abuse alcohol, her school grades declined, and she ran away from home again. According to Jones, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to be with either parent and couldn&#x27;t wait until I was old enough to leave. Show business was my way out.&quot;

In 1963, at 17 years old, Jones dropped out of high school and formed a band that toured mining towns in Ontario. The following year, she adopted the stage name Jenny Jones and moved to Hollywood, Los Angeles. She briefly worked as a strip-club hostess, before moving to Las Vegas to form the all-female rock band The Cover Girls. The band toured throughout Nevada; impressed by Jones&#x27;s performance, she was recruited by Wayne Newton as a background vocalist.

==Career==
===1981–1990: Stand-up comedy===
Jones started her career as a drummer in a rock band, and later attempted a career in stand-up comedy during the 1980s. She experienced some success with comedy, winning the 1986 season of the TV talent show &quot;Star Search&quot;. Prior to that, her first television appearances were as a contestant on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; in 1979 (winning $12,955 in cash &amp; prizes, including a sports car and $6,000 cash), &quot;Match Game&quot; in 1981 (as Jenny Wilburn, winning $5,500), and &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; in 1985 (as Jennie Jones, winning $18,706 over 3 days).

In 1986, Jones appeared as a contestant on &quot;Star Search&quot;, in which she became the first woman to win the comedy category. This appearance boosted Jones&#x27;s stand-up career, and she subsequently served as a supporting act for performers including Sammy Davis Jr., Engelbert Humperdinck, Kenny Loggins, Glen Campbell, Kool &amp; the Gang, Tony Bennett, Dionne Warwick, Gregory Hines, and Wayne Newton.

By 1983, Jones had worked her way up to serving as an opening act for Jerry Seinfeld. She embarked on a comedy show titled Girls&#x27; Night Out. Billed as a &quot;No Men Allowed&quot; event, Jones sold out 10 consecutive shows and had her routine featured on &quot;20/20&quot;.

Jones was profiled alongside other women comedians in the 1991 documentary film &quot;Wisecracks&quot;.

===1991–2003: &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot;===
&quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot; was conceived as an alternative to the &quot;harder-edged&quot; tabloid talk shows that aired at the time. The show premiered in September 1991 on 178 television stations nationwide, which was the biggest launch in syndicated talk show history. It was produced by Telepictures and was distributed by Warner Bros. Television. The show ran from September 1991 to September 2003 and was taped in Chicago at WMAQ-TV studios.

On March 6, 1995, the show taped an episode titled &quot;Revealing Same Sex Secret Crush&quot;; the episode featured six guests who were invited to meet their same-sex secret admirers. Three days after the episode&#x27;s taping, one of the guests killed his secret admirer. Jones provided testimony in the ensuing criminal trial. In August 1995, the victim&#x27;s family filed a lawsuit against &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot; for negligence. Jones was required to testify during the civil trial. The jury initially found in favor of the victim&#x27;s family; however, this judgment was reversed by the Michigan Court of Appeals. The court found that the murder was &quot;unforeseeable&quot; and that the show &quot;had no duty to anticipate and prevent the act of murder committed by [the killer] three days after leaving [the] studio and hundreds of miles away&quot;.

In 1997, Jones released a memoir, &quot;Jenny Jones: My Story&quot;; it was co-authored with Patsi Bale Cox.

In 2003, &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot; broadcast its twelfth and final season. Since the show&#x27;s conclusion, Jones has maintained that she has no interest in returning to television.

===2004–present: Jenny Can Cook and philanthropy===
Jones established The Jenny Jones Foundation in 2005 as a means to provide assistance to those in need. Primary areas of focus are education, women&#x27;s health, and improving communities throughout the country. In 2008, Jenny established &quot;Jenny&#x27;s Heroes,&quot; a program where, through The Jenny Jones Foundation, she is giving two million dollars of her own money to individuals wanting to make a difference in their local communities.

Since the conclusion of &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot;, Jones has focused on creating content about cooking. She stated that her &quot;goal is to motivate more people to cook at home and make healthy eating a priority.&quot; On April 10, 2006, Jones released a cookbook, &quot;Look Good, Feel Great Cookbook&quot;. All of the book&#x27;s proceeds were donated to City of Hope Breast Cancer Research Treatment and Education. In 2008, Jones launched a cooking website and YouTube channel titled Jenny Can Cook.

==Personal life==
Jones maintains an official website, JennyJones.com; a cooking website, JennyCanCook.com; and a YouTube cooking channel. Another website, JennysHeroes.com, which she launched in 2008, features stories from anonymous people who positively impacted their communities. Since the website was launched, Jones has given over $1 million to fifty such people who are looked upon as &quot;heroes&quot;. The site is based upon a segment of the &quot;Jenny Jones&quot; talk show that once featured such people.

Jones has been married three times. She married Al Gambino, a musician, in 1970; they divorced in 1972. Jones married Buz Wilburn, a record marketing executive, in 1973; they divorced in 1980. An earlier marriage was annulled. She is in a long-term relationship with Denis McCallion, a film-location manager.

===Women&#x27;s health advocate===
Jones was an honorary chairperson for the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Chicago Race for the Cure, an annual event that raises awareness and money for breast cancer research. Jones also donated a mobile mammography motor coach to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County. Six silicone-implant operations since 1981 had left her with firm and asymmetrical breasts. Jones later had her breast implants removed, and publicly spoke out against them in a cover story article in &quot;People&quot;. Jones then went on to establish The Image Foundation as a resource for women seeking information about implants and support with body image issues.

<doc id="510339" wikidata="Q2689023" url="?curid=510339" title="USS Raleigh (C-8)">
<text>USS &quot;Raleigh&quot; (C-8) was a United States Navy protected cruiser of the &quot;Cincinnati&quot; class, commissioned in 1894 and in periodic service until 1919.

The second ship named &quot;Raleigh&quot;, was laid down on 19 December 1889 at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia; launched 31 March 1892; sponsored by Mrs. Alfred W. Haywood; and commissioned on 17 April 1894. The ship was named after the City of Raleigh, the capital of North Carolina.

==Pre-Spanish–American War==
Remaining in the yard for another five months, &quot;Raleigh&quot; shifted to Hampton Roads in early September, then conducted shakedown in Chesapeake Bay. In January 1895, she completed fitting out at the torpedo station at Newport, Rhode Island, and on the 25th put to sea to join the North Atlantic Squadron for battle practice in the Caribbean. In June, she put into New York, whence she moved south again for a cruise around the Florida peninsula; and in August, she returned to New York for voyage repairs before resuming operations with her squadron. For the next 10 months, she continued operations in the western Atlantic, ranging from New England to the Straits of Florida.

During the summer of 1896, she trained Naval Militiamen from South Carolina and Louisiana, then returned to the east coast and North Atlantic Squadron exercises. From late October 1896-early February 1897, she joined in a neutrality patrol off Florida, and in April, after the completion of an overhaul at Norfolk, participated in ceremonies marking the dedication of Grant&#x27;s Tomb.

On 6 May, &quot;Raleigh&quot; steamed east, and on 11 June reported for duty on the European Station at Smyrna (now Izmir) on the Aegean Sea. In July, she participated in a good-will tour of Moroccan ports. In August, she cruised off Italy, then returned to the western Mediterranean. Into December, she operated off the Levant and, toward the end of the month transited the Suez Canal en route to the Asiatic Station. On 18 February 1898, she reached Hong Kong where she joined Dewey&#x27;s squadron.

==Spanish–American War==
On 26 April, the US Congress declared war against Spain. On the 27th the squadron got underway for Manila.

At the end of the month, &quot;Raleigh&quot; passed El Fraile Island and was fired on by an enemy battery. With and , she returned the fire, then moved toward Cavite to engage the Spanish fleet. &quot;Raleigh&quot; is credited with firing the first shot of the Battle of Manila Bay from a 5-inch/40 caliber gun.

Steaming in column, the American squadron ran by the Spanish, firing at close range. Two hours later, five cross runs had been completed, and the Spanish fleet had been destroyed. Shore batteries became the targets. Just before noon on 1 May, &quot;Raleigh&quot; joined , &quot;Boston&quot;, and in silencing the navy yard and arsenal batteries. On 2 May, she sent officers ashore to demand the surrender of Corregidor and, on the 3rd, sent men to disable the batteries there and destroy the munitions. In the late afternoon, shore parties were sent to Palo Caballo for the same purpose. &quot;Raleigh&quot; then took up picket and patrol duties, capturing the gunboat on the 12th.

In July, &quot;Raleigh&quot; shifted from Manila Bay to Subic Bay. On the 7th, she shelled Spanish positions on Grande Island until they surrendered; she then sent garrison troops ashore. On the 10th, she returned to Manila, where she remained until after the Spanish surrendered the city in mid-August.

==Pre-World War I==
On the 25th, &quot;Raleigh&quot; put to sea, bound for Hong Kong with mail. In early September, she returned to the Philippines where she operated until sailing for Suez, Gibraltar, and the United States on 15 December. On 15 April 1899, she arrived at New York and the next day received honors from other ships and from officials of the city.

10 days after her arrival, &quot;Raleigh&quot; cleared New York Harbor and turned south. On the 26th, she entered the Delaware River and moved up to Philadelphia, where on the 28th, President William McKinley and Secretary of the Navy John Davis Long came on board to honor the ship and crew for a job well done.

On 2 May, &quot;Raleigh&quot; got underway again, and, after visiting ports in the Carolinas, put into Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she was decommissioned on 10 June.

Recommissioned on 5 January 1903, &quot;Raleigh&quot; was fitted out at New York and in mid-March sailed for Honduras. There, she delivered stores to ships cruising off that coast, then headed east. Steaming via Gibraltar and Suez, she rejoined the Asiatic Fleet at Chefoo, China, on 26 August.

For the next four years she cruised in Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and Philippine waters in support of diplomatic missions as well as showing the flag and conducting good-will tours. One of &quot;Raleigh&quot;&#x27;s sailors, Chief Carpenter&#x27;s Mate Robert Klein, received the Medal of Honor for his actions during a 25 January 1904 incident in which he rescued shipmates who had been overcome by turpentine fumes in a double bottom compartment. On 12 August 1907, she departed Yokosuka for San Francisco. Arriving on 6 September, she proceeded to Mare Island to begin inactivation.

Decommissioned on 12 October 1907, &quot;Raleigh&quot; was recommissioned on 21 February 1911. Initially assigned to the Pacific Reserve Squadron, she remained in San Francisco until December. She then moved north to Bremerton, Washington, and two more years of little activity.

On 6 December 1913, she departed Puget Sound. Steaming south, she joined the active fleet and served as a station ship in Mexican ports, primarily Manzanillo, Mazatlán, La Paz, and Guaymas for the next four years. During the time she interrupted her Mexican assignments twice: for duty at Ocos, Guatemala from 6–25 October 1915; and at Corinto, Nicaragua from 1 April-26 July 1916.

==World War I and beyond==
Undergoing repairs at Mare Island when the United States entered World War I, &quot;Raleigh&quot; departed San Francisco in early May 1917, and on 5 June joined the Patrol Force, Atlantic Fleet, at Newport, R.I. Assigned to Cruiser Force, 2nd Squadron, she patrolled from Boston to Norfolk until November when she was detached for duty in Brazilian waters.

On 12 December, &quot;Raleigh&quot; arrived at Rio de Janeiro, and until 27 April 1918 she patrolled between there and Bahia (Salvador). In May, she arrived off West Africa; delivered munitions to the Liberian Government; continued on to Dakar, French West Africa, then headed west on 18 May. At the end of the month, she resumed Bahia-Rio patrols.

At the same time, however, German U-boats appeared off the east coast of the United States. &quot;Raleigh&quot; was ordered home.

Clearing Bahia on 26 June, she joined the American Patrol Detachment at Key West, Florida, on 21 July and began guarding convoys in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Caribbean, and off the east coast of the Carolinas. She remained on that duty until after the end of the war, and into 1919 continued operations out of Key West. On 6 April, she entered the Charleston Navy Yard and prepared for inactivation. On 21 April, she was decommissioned for the last time, and on 5 August 1921 she was sold for scrapping to Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="510340" wikidata="Q1047034" url="?curid=510340" title="Stellar black hole">
<text>A stellar black hole (or stellar-mass black hole) is a black hole formed by the gravitational collapse of a star. They have masses ranging from about 5 to several tens of solar masses. They are the remnants of supernova explosions, which may be observed as a type of gamma ray burst. These black holes are also referred to as collapsars.

==Properties==
By the no-hair theorem, a black hole can only have three fundamental properties: mass, electric charge, and angular momentum. The angular momentum of a stellar black hole is due to the conservation of angular momentum of the star or objects that produced it.

The gravitational collapse of a star is a natural process that can produce a black hole. It is inevitable at the end of the life of a massive star when all stellar energy sources are exhausted. If the mass of the collapsing part of the star is below the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) limit for neutron-degenerate matter, the end product is a compact star – either a white dwarf (for masses below the Chandrasekhar limit) or a neutron star or a (hypothetical) quark star. If the collapsing star has a mass exceeding the TOV limit, the crush will continue until zero volume is achieved and a black hole is formed around that point in space.

The maximum mass that a neutron star can possess before further collapsing into a black hole is not fully understood. In 1939, it was estimated at 0.7 solar masses, called the TOV limit. In 1996, a different estimate put this upper mass in a range from 1.5 to 3 solar masses. The maximum observed mass of neutron stars is about for PSR J0740+6620 discovered in September, 2019.

In the theory of general relativity, a black hole could exist of any mass. The lower the mass, the higher the density of matter has to be in order to form a black hole. (See, for example, the discussion in Schwarzschild radius, the radius of a black hole.) There are no known stellar processes that can produce black holes with mass less than a few times the mass of the Sun. If black holes that small exist, they are most likely primordial black holes. Until 2016, the largest known stellar black hole was solar masses. In September 2015, a rotating black hole of solar masses was discovered by gravitational waves as it formed in a merger event of two smaller black holes. , the binary system 2MASS J05215658+4359220 was reported to host the smallest-mass black hole currently known to science, with a mass 3.3 solar masses and a diameter of only 19.5 kilometers. 

There is observational evidence for two other types of black holes, which are much more massive than stellar black holes. They are intermediate-mass black holes (in the center of globular clusters) and supermassive black holes in the center of the Milky Way and other galaxies.

==X-ray compact binary systems==

Stellar black holes in close binary systems are observable when the matter is transferred from a companion star to the black hole; the energy released in the fall toward the compact star is so large that the matter heats up to temperatures of several hundred million degrees and radiates in X-rays. The black hole, therefore, is observable in X-rays, whereas the companion star can be observed with optical telescopes. The energy release for black holes and neutron stars are of the same order of magnitude. Black holes and neutron stars are therefore often difficult to distinguish.

The derived masses come from observations of compact X-ray sources (combining X-ray and optical data). All identified neutron stars have a mass below 3.0 solar masses; none of the compact systems with a mass above 3.0 solar masses display the properties of a neutron star. The combination of these facts makes it more and more likely that the class of compact stars with a mass above 3.0 solar masses are in fact black holes.

Note that this proof of the existence of stellar black holes is not entirely observational but relies on theory: we can think of no other object for these massive compact systems in stellar binaries besides a black hole. A direct proof of the existence of a black hole would be if one actually observes the orbit of a particle (or a cloud of gas) that falls into the black hole.

== Black hole kicks ==
The large distances above the galactic plane achieved by some binaries are the result of black hole natal kicks. The velocity distribution of black hole natal kicks seems similar to that of neutron star kick velocities. One might have expected that it would be the momenta that were the same with black holes receiving lower velocity than neutron stars due to their higher mass but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case, which may be due to the fall-back of asymmetrically expelled matter increasing the momentum of the resulting black hole.

== Mass gaps ==
It is predicted by some models of stellar evolution that black holes with masses in two ranges cannot be directly formed by the gravitational collapse of a star. These are sometimes distinguished as the &quot;lower&quot; and &quot;upper&quot; mass gaps, roughly representing the ranges of 2 to 5 and 50 to 150 solar masses (), respectively. Another range given for the upper gap is 52 to 133 . has been regarded as the upper mass limit for stars in the current era of the universe.

=== Lower mass gap ===
A lower mass gap is suspected on the basis of a scarcity of observed candidates with masses within a few solar masses above the maximum possible neutron star mass. The existence and theoretical basis for this possible gap are uncertain. The situation may be complicated by the fact that any black holes found in this mass range may have been created via the merging of binary neutron star systems, rather than stellar collapse. The LIGO/Virgo collaboration has reported three candidate events among their gravitational wave observations in run O3 with component masses that fall in this lower mass gap. There has also been reported an observation of a bright, rapidly rotating giant star in a binary system with an unseen companion emitting no light, including x-rays, but having a mass of solar masses. This is interpreted to suggest that there may be many such low-mass black holes that are not currently consuming any material and are hence undetectable via the usual x-ray signature.

=== Upper mass gap ===
The upper mass gap is predicted by comprehensive models of late-stage stellar evolution. It is expected that with increasing mass, supermassive stars reach a stage where a pair-instability supernova occurs, during which pair production, the production of free electrons and positrons in the collision between atomic nuclei and energetic gamma rays, temporarily reduces the internal pressure supporting the star&#x27;s core against gravitational collapse. This pressure drop leads to a partial collapse, which in turn causes greatly accelerated burning in a runaway thermonuclear explosion, resulting in the star being blown completely apart without leaving a stellar remnant behind.

Pair-instability supernovae can only happen in stars with a mass range from around 130 to 250 solar masses () and low to moderate metallicity (low abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium – a situation common in Population III stars). However, this mass gap is expected to be extended down to about 45 solar masses by the process of pair-instability pulsational mass loss, before the occurrence of a &quot;normal&quot; supernova explosion and core collapse. In nonrotating stars the lower bound of the upper mass gap may be as high as 60 . The possibility of direct collapse into black holes of stars with core mass &gt; 133 , requiring total stellar mass of &gt; 260 has been considered, but there may be little chance of observing such a high-mass supernova remnant; i.e., the lower bound of the upper mass gap may represent a mass cutoff. 

Observations of the LB-1 system of a star and unseen companion were initially interpreted in terms of a black hole with a mass of about 70 solar masses, which would be excluded by the upper mass gap. However, further investigations have weakened this claim.

Black holes may also be found in the mass gap through mechanisms other than those involving a single star, such as the merger of black holes.

==Candidates==
Our Milky Way galaxy contains several stellar-mass black hole candidates (BHCs) which are closer to us than the supermassive black hole in the galactic center region. Most of these candidates are members of X-ray binary systems in which the compact object draws matter from its partner via an accretion disk. The probable black holes in these pairs range from three to more than a dozen solar masses.

=== Extragalactic===
Candidates outside our galaxy come from gravitational wave detections:
Candidates outside our galaxy from X-ray binaries:
The disappearance of N6946-BH1 following a failed supernova in NGC 6946 may have resulted in the formation of a black hole.

<text>Allen Woodring (February 15, 1898 – November 15, 1982) was an American sprint runner. At the 1920 United States Olympic trials, he failed to qualify in the 200 meters yet was selected for the national team and won the Olympic gold medal in this event.

Woodring ran for Mercersburg Academy under Jimmy Curran, before competing for the Meadowbrook Club of Philadelphia. He graduated from Syracuse University and later worked as a salesman for the Spalding Company.

After his athletics career ended he worked as a salesman for Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. In his later years he moved to Florida.

<text>Baffin Bay (Inuktitut: &quot;Saknirutiak Imanga&quot;; ; ; ), located between Baffin Island and the west coast of Greenland, is defined by the International Hydrographic Organization as a marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean. It is sometimes considered a sea of the North Atlantic Ocean. It is connected to the Atlantic via Davis Strait and the Labrador Sea. The narrower Nares Strait connects Baffin Bay with the Arctic Ocean. The bay is not navigable most of the year because of the ice cover and high density of floating ice and icebergs in the open areas. However, a polynya of about , known as the North Water, opens in summer on the north near Smith Sound. Most of the aquatic life of the bay is concentrated near that region.

==Extent==
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of Baffin Bay as follows:
==History==

The area of the bay has been inhabited since  BC. Around AD 1200, the initial Dorset settlers were replaced by the Thule (the later Inuit) peoples. Recent excavations also suggest that the Norse colonization of the Americas reached the shores of Baffin Bay sometime between the 10th and 15th centuries. The English explorer John Davis was the first recorded European to enter the bay, arriving in 1585. In 1612, a group of English merchants formed the &quot;Company of Merchants of London, Discoverers of the North-West Passage&quot;. Their governor Thomas Smythe organized five expeditions to explore the northern coasts of Canada in search of a maritime passage to the Far East. Henry Hudson and Thomas Button explored Hudson Bay, William Gibbons Labrador, and Robert Bylot Hudson Strait and the area which became known as Baffin&#x27;s Bay after his pilot William Baffin. Aboard , Baffin charted the area and named Lancaster, Smith, and Jones Sounds after members of his company. By the completion of his 1616 voyage, Baffin held out no hope of an ice-free passage and the area remained unexplored for another two centuries. Over time, his account came to be doubted until it was confirmed by John Ross&#x27;s 1818 voyage. More advanced scientific studies followed in 1928, in the 1930s and after World War II by Danish, American and Canadian expeditions.

Currently, there are a few Inuit settlements on the Canadian coast of the bay, including Arctic Bay (population 690), Pond Inlet (1,315) and Clyde River (820). Those settlements are accessed and supplied by air and annual sealifts. In 1975, a town was built at Nanisivik to support lead and zinc production at the Nanisivik Mine—the first Canadian mine in the Arctic. The mine was closed in 2002 due to declining resources and metal prices. Whereas the town still has a functional seaport and an airport, as of the 2006 census, it has an official population of zero.

Baffin Bay was the epicenter of a 7.3 magnitude earthquake in 1933. This is the largest known earthquake north of the Arctic Circle. It caused no damage because of its offshore location and the small number of the nearby onshore communities. The northwestern part of the bay remains one of the most seismically active regions in eastern Canada. Five earthquakes of magnitude 6 have occurred here since 1933. The latest strong earthquake occurred on 15 April 2010 and had the magnitude of 5.1.

==Geography and geology==
Baffin Bay is an arm of the Atlantic Ocean bounded by the Baffin Island in the west, Greenland in the east, and Ellesmere Island in the north. It connects to the Atlantic through the Davis Strait, and to the Arctic through several narrow channels of Nares Strait. It is a northwestern extension of the North Atlantic and Labrador Sea. It can also be viewed as a long strait separating Baffin Island and Greenland.

The bay is less than deep near the coast, where the sea bottom is covered with gravel, crushed stone and sand. In the centre, there is a deep pit called the Baffin Basin, reaching (see depth map), which is mostly covered in silt. Currents form a cyclonic circulation. On the eastern periphery, in summer, the West Greenland Current transports water from the Atlantic Ocean to the North. In its western part, the Baffin Island Current brings the Arctic waters to the south.

==Climate, hydrology and hydrochemistry==

The climate is Arctic with frequent storms, especially in winter. Average January temperatures are in the south and in the north. In July, the average temperature is . The annual precipitation is on the Greenland side and about twice as much near Baffin Island.

The water temperature at the surface is below in winter. In summer, it varies from in the south-east to and below at north-west. The salinity exceeds 34‰ (parts per thousand) in winter. In summer, it is 32‰ on the east and 30–31‰ on the west. Deep waters are formed as a result of mixing of Arctic and Atlantic waters; their temperature is about and salinity is 34.5 ‰. In winter, 80% of the bay is covered with continuous ice, floating ice and fast ice. In some winters, the continuous ice stretches from shore to shore. The ice is most abundant in March and least in August–September. In summer, drifting ice remains in the central and western parts of the bay. Numerous icebergs are formed in this period and are brought, together with ice, to the Atlantic Ocean near Newfoundland.

The tides are semidiurnal, with an average height of and the maximum of . Their speed varies between hour and the direction by as much as 180°. This variability results in the collision and crushing of fresh, old, and pack ice. Winds are predominantly north-western through the whole year. South-eastern and eastern winds are common in July and August.

==North Water==

Between May and July (sometimes April), a significant portion of navigable open water (polynya) forms at the extreme north of the bay, presumably due to the relatively warm Greenland Current. With an area of about in summer, it is the largest polynya of the Canadian Arctic and covers the Smith Sound between the Ellesmere Island and Greenland. This polynya has a stable position and existed for at least 9,000 years. It was first described in 1616 by William Baffin and was named North Water by whalers of the 18–19th centuries.

==Wildlife==

The North Water provides air to ice algae and zooplankton and is characterized by abundant fauna. Of about 20,000 beluga whales living in the Baffin Bay, some 15,000 are concentrated at the North Water. Other abundant animals of the region include walrus, narwhal, harp seal, bearded seal, ringed seal, bowhead whale, rorquals and polar bear. All aquatic mammals crucially depend on the availability of open water; they have very limited ability to maintain breathing holes in ice and are all vulnerable to attacks by the polar bear when breathing at the holes. The seals and walrus occupy areas of fast ice, which is essential for giving birth and raising the pups. Bearded seals feed near the bottom of the bay and therefore are restricted to the shallow waters. Ringed seal is the most common meal of the polar bear. It is also an occasional prey of the walrus and Arctic fox. Most large animals of the bay are being traditionally hunted, but the hunting has been restricted in the 20th century in order to preserve the wildlife population. For example, the quota for polar bears in the bay area is 105 per year.

There are about 400 plant and tree species on the bay shores, including birch, willow, alder and plants adapted to salty soils, as well as lyme grass, mosses, and lichens. These serve as food for caribou and rodents, such as lemming. Resident fish species include polar cod, Arctic flounder (Pleuronectidae, Liopsetta), four-horned sculpin and capelin, whereas cod, haddock, herring, halibut, and rattail migrate from the Atlantic. The birds are represented by the little auk, snowy owl, willow ptarmigan, rock ptarmigan, gyrfalcon, Arctic redpoll and guillemots. Most of them migrate to the south during the winter.

== Oil and gas ==

The US Geological Survey has estimated that at least 13% of the world&#x27;s undiscovered oil deposits and 30% of the world&#x27;s undiscovered gas pockets are located in the Arctic, with the seas around Greenland potentially holding large amounts of natural gas and lesser amounts of crude oil and natural-gas liquids. Accordingly, the Greenland authorities have offered a large number of off-shore concessions for potential hydrocarbon (oil and gas) extraction. The largest concession-areas are located in seas west of Greenland; primarily in Baffin Bay and the Davis Strait, but with several smaller concessions in the Greenland Sea in the east also.

==History==

Hiram Hadley, an Earlham College-educated teacher from Indiana, founded Las Cruces College. Upon its opening on September 17, 1888, it included an elementary school, a university preparatory school, and a business school; it &quot;was not a college in the contemporary meaning of the word.&quot;

A year later, the Territorial Assembly of New Mexico provided for the establishment of an agricultural college and agricultural experiment station with the Rodey Act of 1889. It stated: &quot;Said institution is hereby located at or near the town of Las Cruces in the County of Doña Ana, upon a tract of land of not less than one hundred (100) acres.&quot; Designated as the land-grant college for New Mexico under the Morrill Act, it was named the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts.

Las Cruces College merged with the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts and opened on January 21, 1890. It began with 35 students and six faculty members. The college was supposed to graduate its first student in 1893, but the only senior, Sam Steel, was murdered before he was able to receive his diploma. Classes met in the two-room adobe building of Las Cruces College until new buildings were erected on the campus three miles (5 km) south of Las Cruces. In February 1891, McFie Hall, popularly known as Old Main, opened its doors.

In 1960, to better represent its expanded programs and operations, New Mexico A&amp;M was renamed New Mexico State University.

==Organization and administration==
Regulated by the New Mexico Constitution, the Regents of New Mexico State University are a corporate body that implements legislation over the control and management of NMSU. The board is made of up five persons appointed by the governor of New Mexico with the consent of the senate.

Full-time faculty members number 840, with a staff of 3,113.

==Campus==
The main campus of New Mexico State University occupies a core of in the city of Las Cruces, New Mexico. It is located adjacent to Interstate 25, surrounded by desert landscape and greenhouses. The main campus is also bordered by Interstate 10, which is the main east–west interstate highway across the southern part of the United States. To the east of Interstate 25, the campus facilities consist of the President&#x27;s residence, NMSU Golf Course, the &quot;A&quot; Mountain west slope, and the New Mexico Farm and Ranch Heritage Museum. South of University Avenue are Pan American Plaza, 48 acres of horse farm, and the Fabian Garcia Science center, which houses the Chile Pepper Institute&#x27;s research, teaching and demonstration garden, algal biofuels research equipment, grape vineyards and gazebos, and fields and greenhouses for plant research projects. About six miles south of campus, on 203 acres of land, is the Leyendecker Plant Science Research Center.

The Las Cruces campus is home to a nesting population of Swainson&#x27;s hawks, a raptor species currently protected by federal law. Pedestrians are advised to be careful when walking on Stewart Street, as the birds can be aggressive during nesting season.

The first master plan of the university was to create a &quot;horseshoe&quot;, a U-shaped drive, in an open large lawn. At the center was Old Main, the original campus building, originally known as McFie Hall, which was destroyed by fire in 1910 (the remains are now a college landmark). The cornerstone and remains of Mcfie Hall stand near the flagpole in the middle of the horseshoe. Today, the horseshoe is the center of campus and is the location of the main administration building, Hadley Hall, which sits at the top of the horseshoe, and other classroom buildings.

NMSU is a land-grant institution with a presence in all 33 counties of New Mexico, a satellite learning center in Albuquerque, 13 research and science centers, distance education opportunities, and five campuses in Alamogordo, Carlsbad, Grants, Doña Ana County, and Las Cruces.

==Traditions==
===Aggies===
The nickname was derived from its roots and beginnings as an agricultural school and the state&#x27;s only designated land-grant university.

===Victory Bell===
In the 1940s, the Victory Bell, a gift of the Class of 1939, was housed in an open-sided structure on the Horseshoe and rung to announce Aggie victories. In 1972, the bell was rededicated as the NMSU Engineer&#x27;s Bell and mounted on a platform near Goddard Hall. On game days, various school organizations took turns in toting the ringing bell around Las Cruces before kick-off. The bell was then taken to Aggie Memorial Stadium where it rang after Aggie touchdowns. More recently, the bell has been permanently mounted at field level just behind the south goalpost.

===&quot;A&quot; tradition===
In 1920, students of then New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts scouted for an appropriate place to display their school letter. Tortugas Mountain, located three miles (5 km) east of campus, seemed a natural spot. Brave males gathered enough stones to form a big &quot;A&quot; easily visible from campus and the surrounding area. On the following day, April 1, students trudged up the mountain side with their five-gallon cans of whitewash and splashed it on the stones, turning them into a gleaming white &quot;A&quot;. For many years, giving the &quot;A&quot; its annual fresh coat of whitewash was an all-school effort. The seniors mixed lime and water at the foot of the mountain and the freshmen and sophomores toted the mixture up to the juniors who splashed it on the &quot;A.&quot; With the growth of the university through the years, the tradition was taken over by the Greek Council.

===The Pride of New Mexico Marching Band===
The marching band of New Mexico State University is known as the Pride of New Mexico. It is composed of approximately 200 musicians, dancers, and auxiliary.

===The Wonder Dog===
At kickoff of every NMSU home football game, Aggie fans await the &quot;Wonder Dog&quot; to retrieve the kicking tee from the football field. This tradition started in the mid-1990s. The first &quot;Wonder Dog&quot; was Smoki, a border collie-Australian shepherd mix born in Capitan, New Mexico, and trained by Joel Sims, an NMSU alumnus. Smoki &quot;The Wonder Dog&quot; entertained the Aggie crowd for six years and retired in 2002. She also debuted in a Hollywood film which co-starred Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid, entitled &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;, as a town dog. Smoki &quot;The Wonder Dog&quot; died at the age of 15 in 2005. Since then, the tradition ended until 2012, when a tryout for the next &quot;Wonder Dog&quot; took place. A panel of celebrity judges chose a four-year old border collie, Striking as the next &quot;Wonder Dog&quot;. Striking first appeared on August 30, 2012, at the NMSU-Sacramento State home game.

===Crimson Fridays===
Every Friday, some students, faculties, staff, and alumni of NMSU wear crimson colors to show support for the university and the school&#x27;s sports programs.

===NMSU ring===
The official ring of New Mexico State University is given to students with junior and senior standing, and alumni of NMSU, to celebrate and commemorate their achievements and NMSU traditions. The official Ring Ceremony is sponsored by the Alumni Association, which is held every spring and fall Semester at the Aggie Memorial Tower.

The official ring is manufactured by Balfour, which comes with white gold and yellow gold, with an optional stone; diamond or cubic zirconia at the centerpiece of the ring; and is presented with Hatch Chile Ristra. The top of the ring highlights the NMSU three triangles school seal, encircled with the school name. The three triangles represent NMSU&#x27;s role as a land-grant university – teaching, research, and service. It also represents the connection of Spanish, American Indian, and Anglo cultures in New Mexico, and the triangulation of NMSU campus with Interstate 10 linking Interstate 25 in the first principal interchange of the Pan American Highway in North America. The one side of the ring shows the Aggie Memorial Tower, in honor of Aggies who died for the country, and the other side of the ring displays the majestic Organ Mountains. Students wear the ring facing the school name. Upon granting of degrees, graduates should turn the ring around facing outward, which symbolizes that they are ready to face the world.

===Noche de Luminarias===
A tradition that signals the beginning of the holiday season is the &quot;Noche de Luminarias&quot; or &quot;Night of Lights&quot;. A university tradition that started as the President&#x27;s Holiday Reception in 1984, which starts the holiday season with a night of entertainment and festivities. It is considered one of the largest luminaria displays in the state of New Mexico. Each candle set is lit inside a paper bag. With more than 6,000 luminarias, it begins at the Educational Services Building, extends towards the International Mall and then encircles the Corbett Center Student Union. The display is set up by the Las Cruces High School band and accompanies visitors as they walk through the lighted path by the Las Cruces High School Brass Choir.

==Athletics==
NMSU&#x27;s teams are called the s, a nickname derived from the university&#x27;s agricultural beginnings.

New Mexico State is a member of Conference USA (C-USA), as of July 1, 2023. Conference USA is the sixth conference NMSU has been affiliated with in its football history. New Mexico State spent the past eighteen seasons as a member of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). Before that, NMSU was a member of the Big West Conference, Sun Belt Conference, Missouri Valley Conference and the Border Conference.

In 2023, two basketball players complained of sexual assault during hazing rituals. Deuce Benjamin settled out of court for $4.125 million, Shak Odunewu settled out of court for $3.875 million, and the case was dropped with no verdict. As a result of the investigation, the head coach Greg Heiar was fired and students were found guilty of a Title VI violation by the university and were removed. A criminal case against those students who were on the 2022-23 basketball team, is still ongoing. A second lawsuit was filed against the university, the athletic director and several coaches and students, alleging the presence of guns on campus and hazing, and that the coach was aware but failed to act, all in violation of university policy.

The Women&#x27;s Equestrian Team was first established in 2004 and cut following the 2016–2017 season due to budget cuts.

===Rivalries===

NMSU maintains strong athletic rivalries with the University of New Mexico. The UNM-NMSU rivalry is called the Rio Grande Rivalry (aka Battle of I-25), a competitive series based on points awarded to the winners of head-to-head competitions between the two universities in every sport. A rotating trophy is granted to the winning university for a period of one year, until the award presentation the following year.

<text>In differential geometry, the first fundamental form is the inner product on the tangent space of a surface in three-dimensional Euclidean space which is induced canonically from the dot product of . It permits the calculation of curvature and metric properties of a surface such as length and area in a manner consistent with the ambient space. The first fundamental form is denoted by the Roman numeral ,
formula_1

== Definition ==

Let be a parametric surface. Then the inner product of two tangent vectors is
formula_2
where , , and are the coefficients of the first fundamental form.

The first fundamental form may be represented as a symmetric matrix.
formula_3

==Further notation==
When the first fundamental form is written with only one argument, it denotes the inner product of that vector with itself.
formula_4

The first fundamental form is often written in the modern notation of the metric tensor. The coefficients may then be written as : 
formula_5

The components of this tensor are calculated as the scalar product of tangent vectors and :
formula_6
for . See example below.

==Calculating lengths and areas==

The first fundamental form completely describes the metric properties of a surface. Thus, it enables one to calculate the lengths of curves on the surface and the areas of regions on the surface. The line element may be expressed in terms of the coefficients of the first fundamental form as
formula_7 

The classical area element given by can be expressed in terms of the first fundamental form with the assistance of Lagrange&#x27;s identity,
formula_8

===Example: curve on a sphere===
A spherical curve on the unit sphere in may be parametrized as
formula_9
Differentiating with respect to and yields
formula_10
The coefficients of the first fundamental form may be found by taking the dot product of the partial derivatives.

formula_11
so:
formula_12

====Length of a curve on the sphere====

The equator of the unit sphere is a parametrized curve given by
formula_13
with ranging from 0 to 2. The line element may be used to calculate the length of this curve.

formula_14

====Area of a region on the sphere====

The area element may be used to calculate the area of the unit sphere.

formula_15

==Gaussian curvature==

The Gaussian curvature of a surface is given by 
formula_16
where , , and are the coefficients of the second fundamental form.

Theorema egregium of Gauss states that the Gaussian curvature of a surface can be expressed solely in terms of the first fundamental form and its derivatives, so that is in fact an intrinsic invariant of the surface. An explicit expression for the Gaussian curvature in terms of the first fundamental form is provided by the Brioschi formula.

<text>The Buffalo Museum of Science is a science museum located at Martin Luther King Jr. Park in Buffalo, New York, United States, northeast of the downtown district, near the Kensington Expressway. The historic building was designed by August Esenwein and James A. Johnson and was dedicated on January 19, 1929. It gave a permanent home to the exhibits that started to be collected by the Buffalo Young Men&#x27;s Association (founded 1836), which had passed them to its 1861 creation, the Buffalo Natural History Society, with George W. Clinton chosen as the Society&#x27;s first president.

The attractions of the Buffalo Museum of Science include exhibits showcasing animals, astronomy, the science of technology, and additional science topics.

==Exhibitions==

===Explorations===
Explorations is an interactive gallery for children ages two to seven featuring new themes every month.

===Explore You Science Studio===
Explore You is a health systems science studio. The space was remodeled and opened in March 2012. The interactive exhibit gives a hands-on approach to health, exploring topics such as healthy choices, body systems, the heart, medical technology, genetics, and related research done in Western New York. It is sponsored by prominent local health insurance company Independent Health.

===Rethink Extinct Science Studio===
The Rethink Extinct Science Studio opened in March 2015 as remodel of the previous Extinction Gallery. This exhibit focuses on all aspects of extinction throughout the history of life on this planet including present-day extinctions and endangered plants and animals.

The Extinction Gallery was a collection of fossils and cultural pieces relating to organisms that have gone extinct on the planet. Specimens include 50-million-year-old birds, feathers and flowers, the earliest known land plant, a trilobite trapped in a seashell nearly 400 million years ago, a cast of a &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; skull, a compression fossil replica of &quot;Archaeopteryx,&quot; &quot;Triceratops horridus&quot;, &quot;Deinonychus antirrhopus&quot;, and &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot;. Many of the pieces in this exhibit come from the previous Dinosaurs and Co. space at the museum. In addition, a specimen of &quot;Albertosaurus sarcophagus&quot; (nicknamed &quot;Stanley&quot;) is displayed in the first floor lobby next to admissions.

===Nano===
Nano is an interactive exhibition that engages family audiences in nanoscale science, engineering, and technology. Hands-on exhibits present the basics of nanoscience and engineering, introduce some real world applications, and explore the societal and ethical implications of this new technology.

===Other exhibitions===
Additional exhibitions include the Buffalo in Space Science Studio (opened in 2017), the Artifacts Science Studio (opened in March 2014), the In Motion Science Studio (opened in 2013), the Our Marvelous Earth Science Studio (opened in 2012), and the Bug Works Science Studio (opened in 2013).

In 2010 the museum began an extensive renovation campaign, the goal of which was to convert the old diorama based exhibits into interactive Science Studios. This campaign culminated with the renovation and reopening of the Kellogg Observatory in July 2018

==Previous exhibits==

===Whem Ankh: The Cycle of Life in Ancient Egypt===
Whem Ankh was an exhibit running from 1998 to 2013 displaying artifacts from the daily life as lived on the banks of the lower Nile River 2,200 years ago. Over 250 artifacts are included in the collection, including the mummies of Nes-hor and of Nes-min, priests in the temple of the Egyptian fertility god Min, and the coffin of Djed-hor-ef-ankh.

Intended as a temporary exhibit, it was made permanent due to its initial popularity, which it enjoyed through most of its tenure. Whem Ankh closed in July 2013, and was replaced by the &quot;Artifacts&quot; exhibit in March 2014.

===Marchand Hall of Wildflowers===
The Marchand Hall of Wildflowers displayed numerous wax models of species of plant life created throughout several decades by naturalists George and Paul Marchand.

==Additional features==
The museum also features the National Geographic 3D Cinema, Elements Café, and the Curiosity Shop.

<doc id="510370" wikidata="Q1306920" url="?curid=510370" title="Neurofeedback">
<text>Neurofeedback is a form of biofeedback that uses electrical potentials in the brain to reinforce desired brain states through operant conditioning. This process is non-invasive neurotherapy and typically collects brain activity data using electroencephalography (EEG). Several neurofeedback protocols exist, with potential additional benefit from use of quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to localize and personalize treatment. Related technologies include functional near-infrared spectroscopy-mediated (fNIRS) neurofeedback, hemoencephalography biofeedback (HEG), and fMRI biofeedback.

Placebo-controlled trials have often found the control group to show the same level of improvement as the group receiving actual neurofeedback treatment, which suggests these improvements may be caused by secondary effects instead. Neurofeedback has been shown to trigger positive behavioral outcomes, such as relieving symptoms related to psychiatric disorders or improving specific cognitive functions in healthy participants. These positive behavioral outcomes rely on brain plasticity mechanisms and the ability of subjects to learn throughout life.

==History==
In 1898, Edward Thorndike formulated the law of effect. In his work, he theorized that behavior is shaped by satisfying or discomforting consequences. This set the foundation for operant conditioning.

In 1924, the German psychiatrist Hans Berger connected several electrodes to a patient&#x27;s scalp and detected a small current by using a ballistic galvanometer. In his subsequent studies, Berger analyzed EEGs qualitatively, but in 1932, G. Dietsch applied Fourier analysis to seven EEG records and later became the first researcher to apply quantitative EEG (QEEG).

In 1950, Neal E. Miller of Yale University was able to train mice to regulate their heartbeat frequency. Later on, he continued his work with humans, training them through auditory feedback.

The first study to demonstrate neurofeedback was reported by Joe Kamiya in 1962. Kamiya&#x27;s experiment had two parts: In the first part, a subject was asked to keep their eyes closed, and when a tone sounded, to say whether they were experiencing alpha waves. Initially, the subject would guess correctly about fifty percent of the time, but some subjects would eventually develop the ability to better distinguish between states.

M. Barry Sterman trained cats to modify their EEG patterns to exhibit more of the so-called sensorimotor rhythm (SMR). He published this research in 1967. Sterman subsequently discovered that the SMR-trained cats were much more resistant to epileptic seizures after exposure to the convulsant chemical monomethylhydrazine than non-trained cats. In 1971, he reported similar improvements with an epileptic patient whose seizures could be controlled through SMR training. Joel Lubar contributed to the research of EEG biofeedback, starting with epilepsy and later with hyperactivity and ADHD. Ming-Yang Cheng was instrumental in advancing research on EEG neurofeedback, specifically targeting enhancements in SMR power among skilled golfers.

==Neuroplasticity==
In 2010, a study provided some evidence of neuroplastic changes occurring after brainwave training. In this study, half an hour of voluntary control of brain rhythms led to a lasting shift in cortical excitability and intracortical function. The authors observed that the cortical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was significantly enhanced after neurofeedback, persisted for at least twenty minutes, and was correlated with an EEG time-course indicative of activity-dependent plasticity

==Types of neurofeedback==
The term neurofeedback is not legally protected. There are various approaches that give feedback about neuronal activity, and as such are referred to as &quot;neurofeedback&quot; by their respective operators. Distinctions can be made on several levels. The first takes into account which technology is being used (EEG, fMRI, fNIRS, HEG). Nonetheless, further distinctions are crucial even within the realm of EEG neurofeedback, as different methodologies of analysis can be chosen, some of which are backed up by a higher number of peer-reviewed studies, whereas for others, scientific literature is scarce, and explanatory models are entirely missing.

Despite these differences, a common denominator can be found in the requirement of providing feedback. Usually, feedback is provided by auditory or visual input. While original feedback was provided by sounding tones according to neurological activity, many new ways have been found. It is possible to listen to music or podcasts where the volume is controlled as feedback, for example. Often, visual feedback is used in the form of animations on a TV screen. Visual feedback can also be provided in combination with videos and films, or even during reading tasks where the brightness of the screen represents the direct feedback. Simple games can also be used, where the game itself is controlled by the brain activity. Recent developments have tried to incorporate virtual reality (VR), and controllers can already be used for more involved engagement with the feedback.

===EEG neurofeedback===
====Frequency band / amplitude training====
Amplitude training, or frequency band training (used synonymously), is the method with the largest body of scientific literature; it also represents the original method of EEG neurofeedback. The EEG signal is analyzed with respect to its frequency spectrum, split into the common frequency bands used in EEG neuroscience (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma). The activity involves training the amplitude of a certain frequency band on a defined location on the scalp to higher or lower values.

Depending on the training goal (for example, increasing attention and focus, reaching a calm state, reducing epileptic seizures, etc.), the electrodes have to be placed in different positions. Additionally, the trained frequency bands and the training directions (to higher or lower amplitudes) might vary according to the training goal.

Thus, EEG wave components that are expected to be beneficial to the training goal are rewarded with positive feedback when appearing and/or increasing in amplitude. Frequency band amplitudes that are expected to be hindering are trained downwards by reinforcement through the feedback.

As an example, considering ADHD, this would result in training low-beta or mid-beta frequencies in the central-to-frontal lobe to increase in amplitude, while simultaneously trying to reduce theta and high-beta amplitudes in the same region of the brain.

In the sports domain, SMR training has garnered attention, with a substantial body of research suggesting that enhancing it could improve performance. This improvement is particularly evident after multiple training sessions designed to enhance motor skills critical for precise movements. Such precision is required in various sports activities, including golf putting, soccer free kicks, and basketball free throws.

====SCP training====
For SCP (slow cortical potentials) training, one trains the DC voltage component of the EEG signal. The application of this type of EEG neurofeedback training was mostly endorsed by research done by Niels Birbaumer and his group. The most common symptom base for SCP training is ADHD, whereas SCPs also find their application in brain-computer interfaces.

====LORETA (low resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis) training====
Normal EEG signals are restricted to the surface of the scalp. Using a high number of electrodes (19 or more), the source of certain electrical events can be localized. Similar to a tomography that renders a 3D image out of many 2D images, the many EEG channels are used to create LORETA images that represent in 3D the electrical activity distribution within the brain. The LORETA method can be used in combination with MRI to merge structural and functional activities. It is able to provide even better temporal resolution than PET or fMRI. For the application with live neurofeedback, however, 19-channel neurofeedback and LORETA has limited scientific evidence, and until now, shows no benefit over traditional 1- or 2-channel neurofeedback.

==Discussion and critique==
There is ongoing discussion about the effect size of neurofeedback in the scientific literature. As neurofeedback is explained mostly based on the model of operant conditioning, the sensitivity of the feedback (the difficulty to receive a reward) also plays a role. It has been shown that the desired conditioning can be reversed if threshold values are set too low. Other publications have not found any effect of neurofeedback, apart from placebo, when using automatic thresholds that update every thirty seconds in order to maintain a constant success rate of 80%.

<text>Louis Le Vau (; c. 1612 – 11 October 1670) was a French Baroque architect, who worked for Louis XIV of France. He was an architect that helped develop the French Classical style in the 17th century.

==Early life and career==
Born Louis Le Veau, he was the son of Louis Le Veau (died February 1661), a stonemason, who was active in Paris. His younger brother François Le Vau (born in 1624) also became an architect. The father and his two sons worked together in the 1630s and 1640s. The two brothers later changed the spelling of their surname from &quot;Le Veau&quot; to &quot;Le Vau&quot; to avoid its association with the French word &quot;veau&quot; (calf).

Le Vau started his career by designing the Hotel de Bautru in 1634. By 1639, he was developing town houses (&quot;hôtels particuliers&quot;) for rich citizens such as Sainctot, Hesselin, Gillier, Gruyn des Bordes, and Jean Baptiste Lambert in the île Saint-Louis, which was being developed as a residential area. His most notable work during this period is the Hôtel Lambert ().

Le Vau also designed country houses, including the Château de Livry (), later known as the Château du Raincy.

==Royal architect==
In 1654, his career was advanced through his appointment as the first architect to the king, succeeding Jacques Lemercier. He was commissioned by Jules Cardinal Mazarin to help rebuild part of the medieval Château de Vincennes.

Shortly after, in 1656 he was given the important commission to build the chateau of Nicolas Fouquet, Vaux-le-Vicomte with the help of André Le Nôtre and Charles Le Brun. Le Vau&#x27;s most notable work in the Vaux-le-Vicomte is the oval salon facing the garden. This design, an example of a &quot;salon à l&#x27;italienne&quot; (vaulted, two-storied room), develops the idea that a simple form governs the shape of the main section of the building.

In the 1660s Le Vau helped on royal projects, such as the hospital of La Salpêtrière and the facade of the Tuileries Palace. From 1661 to 1664 Le Vau worked on rebuilding the Galerie d&#x27;Apollon in the Louvre after it burned in a fire. Claude Perrault and Charles Le Brun were also involved in creating the famous façade for the east front of the Louvre from 1665 to 1674, which acted as a prelude for Classical Architecture in the 18th century.

The most notable work of Le Vau&#x27;s career was at the Palace of Versailles with which he was involved for the remainder of his life. He added service wings to the forecourts and, after 1668, had rebuilt the garden façade to be totally classical. Le Vau was assisted by François d&#x27;Orbay, who completed the work after Le Vau&#x27;s death. Le Vau and d&#x27;Orbay&#x27;s work at Versailles was later modified and extended by Jules Hardouin-Mansart.

Le Vau&#x27;s designs for the Collège des Quatre-Nations (now housing the Institut de France) were completed after his death by his assistant François d&#x27; Orbay and showed unlikely rapport with Italian baroque techniques.

Louis Le Vau died in Paris.

<text>Ernst von Salomon (25 September 1902 – 9 August 1972) was a German novelist and screenwriter. He was a Weimar-era national-revolutionary activist and right-wing Freikorps member.

== Family and education ==
He was born in Kiel, in the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein, the son of a criminal investigation officer. Salomon attended the Musterschule gymnasium in Frankfurt.

== Military service ==
From 1913 Salomon was raised as a cadet in Karlsruhe and in Lichterfelde near Berlin; during the German Revolution of 1918–19, he joined the paramilitary &quot;Freikorps&quot; (&quot;Free-Corps&quot;) unit under Georg Ludwig Rudolf Maercker suppressing the Spartacist Uprising. Later in 1919, he fought in the Baltic against the Bolsheviks and the Estonian and Latvian armies. With his unit he took part in the Kapp-Putsch in March 1920. He also fought against Polish insurgents in the Silesian Uprisings of 1921.

== Political activity before and during WW2 ==
After the &quot;Freikorps&quot; units had been officially dissolved in 1920, Salomon joined the &quot;Organisation Consul&quot; and received a five-year prison sentence in 1922 for his part in the assassination of Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau – he provided a car for the assassins. In 1927, he received another prison sentence for an attempted &quot;Feme&quot; murder (paramilitary &quot;self-justice&quot;), and was pardoned by Reich President Paul von Hindenburg after a few months – he had not killed the severely wounded victim, Wagner, when he pleaded for his life, which was noted by the court.

After his release from prison, Salomon committed himself to the support of &quot;Feme&quot; murder convicts and began to publish feuilleton articles in the national conservative &quot;Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; newspaper, which earned him the attention of Conservative Revolutionary and National Bolshevist circles around Friedrich Hielscher and Arnolt Bronnen.

In 1929, he backed his elder brother Bruno in his struggle for the Schleswig-Holstein Rural People&#x27;s Movement by simulating a bomb attack on the Reichstag building in Berlin. He had to spend three months in investigative custody, during which time he finished writing his first novel &quot;The Outlaws&quot; (&quot;Die Geächteten&quot;), published by Ernst Rowohlt.

Unlike many other German writers and poets, he did not sign the &quot;Gelöbnis treuester Gefolgschaft&quot; proclamation of loyalty to Adolf Hitler. He had been arrested after the Nazi &quot;Machtergreifung&quot;, together with Hans Fallada, but was released after a few days. Suspiciously eyed by the authorities, who suspected him to be an adherent of Otto Strasser&#x27;s &quot;Third Position&quot;, he earned his living by writing film scripts for the German film company &quot;UFA&quot;. Salomon wrote the screenplay for the 1941 anti-British propaganda film &quot;Carl Peters&quot;. From October 1944 to May 1945, he was deployed in the local Volkssturm. Salomon supported Ernst Rowohlt after he had received a publishing ban for employing Jewish personnel and temporarily corresponded with conservative resistance circles around Arvid Harnack and Harro Schulze-Boysen. His lover, Ille Gotthelft, was Jewish but he was able to protect her from persecution by passing her off as his spouse.

In June 1945, Salomon was interned by American military occupation authorities due to his active opposition to democracy during the Weimar era and his proximity to Nazi ideology. Gotthelft was also interned. In his autobiographical &quot;The Answers&quot;, Salomon described how he and his lover were seriously mistreated by American soldiers when he was in custody, being called &quot;Nazi pig!&quot; and &quot;despicable creatures&quot;. Salomon was imprisoned by the Americans until September 1946.

In 1951, Salomon published the book &quot;The Questionnaire&quot; (&quot;Der Fragebogen&quot;), in which he gave his ironic and sarcastic &quot;Answers&quot; to the 131 point questionnaire concerning people&#x27;s activities between 1933-1945 which the Western Allied Military Governments in Germany issued by the tens of thousands at the end of the war. A famous public discussion of the book took place in the main train station of Cologne, organised by bookseller Gerhard Ludwig. Although Liberals and the Left condemned it violently, the book was a sensation in Germany and between its publication in 1951 and 1954 by which time it had sold over 250,000 copies.

==Death==
Ernst von Salomon died of heart failure at his home near Hamburg on 9 August 1972. He was 69 years of age.

<text>Bixa orellana, also known as achiote, is a shrub or small tree native to Central America. &quot;Bixa orellana&quot; is grown in many countries worldwide.

The plant is best known as the source of annatto, a natural orange-red condiment (also called or ) obtained from the waxy arils that cover its seeds. The ground seeds are widely used in traditional dishes in Central and South America, Mexico, and the Caribbean, such as &quot;cochinita pibil&quot;, chicken in , , and . Annatto and its extracts are also used as an industrial food coloring to add yellow or orange color to many products such as butter, cheese, margarine, ice creams, meats, and condiments. Some of the indigenous peoples of North, Central, and South America originally used the seeds to make red body paint and lipstick, as well as a spice. For this reason, the &quot;Bixa orellana&quot; is sometimes called the lipstick tree.

==Etymology and common names==
The name &quot;Bixa orellana&quot; was given by Linnaeus. The botanical genus name derives from the aboriginal Taíno word &quot;bixa&quot;, while the specific epithet was derived in honor of the Amazon explorer Francisco de Orellana, an early explorer of the Amazon River. The name &quot;achiote&quot; derives from the Nahuatl word for the shrub, . It may also be referred to as , or by its original Tupi name , or (&quot;red color&quot;), which is also used for the body paint prepared from its seeds. Colloquial names include &quot;bija&quot;, &quot;roucou&quot;, &quot;orellana&quot;, &quot;annatto&quot;, &quot;achiote&quot;, and many other names used regionally. The nickname, &quot;lipstick tree&quot;, derived from use of the dye as a cosmetic.

==Description==
&quot;Bixa orellana&quot; is a perennial, tall shrub to small evergreen tree that can reach high. It bears clusters of bright white or pink flowers, resembling single wild roses, that appear at the tips of the branches. The fruits of the &quot;Bixa orellana&quot; are globular, ovoid capsules arranged in clusters resembling spiky looking red-brown seed pods covered in soft spines. Each capsule, or pod, contains 30–45 cone-shaped seeds covered in a thin waxy blood-red aril. When fully mature, the pod dries, hardens, and splits open, thereby exposing the seeds.

The plant is most well known as the source of the red-orange annatto pigment. The pigment is derived from the pericarp (the waxy aril layer that covers the seeds) of the &quot;Bixa orellana&quot; fruit. The red-orange annatto dye is rich in the carotenoid pigments, 80% which consists of bixin (the red pigment) and norbixin or orelline (the yellow pigment).
Annatto oil contains tocotrienols, beta-carotene, essential oils, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, flavonoids, and vitamin C.

==Distribution==
Although the exact origin of &quot;Bixa orellana&quot; is unknown, it is native to northern South America and the Central American tropics: &quot;it is said to be indigenous by Seemann on the northwest coast of Mexico and Panama, by Triana in New Granada, by Meyer in Dutch Guiana, and by Piso and Claussen in Brazil&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Bixa orellana&quot; is found in substantial wild and cultivated acreages from Mexico to Ecuador, Brazil, and Bolivia. Although an invasive species, it is cultivated in many world regions.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, the annatto dye was distributed to Southeast Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, Hawaii and southeastern North America in tropical and subtropical regions through trading exchanges. It became cultivated in tropical regions of Asia, such as India, Sri Lanka, and Java mainly for the dye which the seeds yield.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Bixa orellana&quot; grows easily in subtropical to tropical climates, in frost-free regions sheltered from cool winds. It prefers year-round moisture, good drainage, and moderately fertile soil in full sun or partial shade. It can be propagated from seed and cuttings. Cutting-grown plants flower at a younger age than seedlings.

The main commercial producers of &quot;B. orellana&quot; are countries in Latin America (specifically Peru, Brazil and Mexico), which constitute 60% of total world production followed by Africa (27% of total world production) and Asia (12% of total world production). Production statistics are not usually available and would not provide a reliable guide to international trade, since many of the producing countries use significant quantities domestically (e.g., Brazil is a large producer and consumer, needing additional imports). Annual world production of dried annatto seed at the beginning of the 21st century was estimated at 10,000 tons, of which 7,000 tons enter international trade. Peru is the largest exporter of annatto seed, annually about 4,000 tons; Brazil the largest producer, with about 5,000 tons. Kenya exports annually about 1,500 tons annatto seed and extracts and is the second-largest exporter, after Peru. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Angola, and the Philippines are also exporters.

==Industrial uses==

Before synthetic dyes revolutionized industry, &quot;Bixa orellana&quot; (which is the only plant to produce the pigment bixin) was planted commercially. The pigment is extracted from the pericarp of the seeds through use of alkaline water, vegetable oil, or organic solvents.

The annatto pigment has global economic significance, as it is one of the most widely used natural dyes to color food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. It is used commonly in foods because the coloring does not alter the flavor and is not toxic. It is mainly used to dye ice cream, meats, dairy products (cheeses, butter and margarine) and condiments. Cosmetic products include lipstick, hair coloring products, nail polish, soaps, lacquers and paints.

==Culinary uses==
Ground &quot;Bixa orellana&quot; seeds are often mixed with other seeds or spices to form a paste or powder for culinary uses in Latin American, Jamaican, Chamorro, and Filipino cuisines. The seeds are heated in oil or lard to extract their dye and flavor for use in dishes and processed foods such as cheese, butter, soup, gravy, sauces, cured meats, and other items. The seeds impart a subtle flavor and aroma and a yellow to reddish-orange color to food.

A condiment called is commonly used in Spanish, Latin American, and Caribbean cuisine for meats and fish. The Spanish word means &quot;season&quot; or &quot;seasoning&quot;. is made with ground &quot;Bixa orellana&quot; seeds and packaged into small, disposable foil packets for easy use. Additionally, cumin, coriander seeds, salt, and garlic powder are included in these condiment packets. On Spanish-speaking Caribbean islands, the annatto pigment is also used to make yellow rice and is sometimes added to sofrito. Additionally, in the French Caribbean, it is added to a fish or pork stew called blaff.

In Brazil, a powder known as or is made from the ground seeds combined with filler seeds like maize. This powder is similar to and sometimes replaces paprika. In Nicaragua, the most common way achiote is used in their cuisine and dishes is in the form of a paste. It is used in many national dishes, such as chancho con yuca, nacatamal, and fritanga. The Yucatecan condiment called , or &quot;achiote paste&quot;, is made from ground &quot;Bixa orellana&quot; seeds combined with other spices and is a mainstay in Mexican and Belizean cuisines.

==Traditional uses==
One major traditional use of the &quot;Bixa orellana&quot; plant was for body, face, and hair paint among various tribes and ancient civilizations either for decorative purposes or as omens to ward off evil spirits and illnesses. It has been reported to be used by Brazilian native tribes, the native Taínos in Puerto Rico, the Tsáchila of Ecuador and different Amazonian tribes. As a result of the Spanish Conquest, the &quot;Bixa orellana&quot; was introduced to peoples like the Aztecs, Incas and Mochicas, who showed evidence of later use. The Aztecs also apparently used the annatto pigment as red ink for manuscript painting in the 16th century.

&quot;Bixa orellana&quot; is used in traditional medicine. The tree has been used in Ayurveda, the folk medicine practices of India, where different parts of the plant are thought to be useful as therapy.

The plant is valued for its stem fiber to make rope mats and for the adhesive gum.

<doc id="510446" wikidata="Q213075" url="?curid=510446" title="Short-handed">
<text>Short-handed is a term used in ice hockey and several related sports, including water polo, and refers to having fewer players on the ice during play, as a result of a penalty. The player removed from play serves the penalty in the penalty box for a set amount of time proportional to the severity of the infraction. If a goaltender commits a minor infraction, another player who was on the ice at the time of the penalty serves, often but not necessarily the team captain.

The penalized team is said to be on the penalty kill, abbreviated as &quot;PK&quot; for recording purposes, while their players are in the penalty box. The opposing team is usually referred to as having an &quot;advantage&quot; until the penalized player returns to play. This situation is often called a power play for the opposing team. The advantage largely comes from having an additional player, making it impossible for the short-handed team to defend every player one-on-one and, in the event the short-handed team is making an offensive run, the team on the power play can double-team one of the short-handed team&#x27;s players while still covering everyone else.

The short-handed team has one advantage during a power play: it is free to ice the puck without the play being stopped and thus can change lines at roughly the same intervals as during five-on-five play. This advantage can also be exploited by skaters with enough speed and offensive skill: without the threat of icing, breakaways can be more safely attempted, which opens the opportunity for short-handed goals. However, two governing bodies have enforced icing on power plays, thus putting the short-handed team at an even stronger disadvantage:
* The World Hockey Association did so during the 1970s.
* USA Hockey has done so in all sanctioned youth competitions (players 14 and under, in all age groups) since 2017–18.

The team on the power play often only has one defenseman at the rear rather than the typical two, in favor of adding another attacker. Rarely, teams have pulled their goalie for the sixth on-ice player (such as in Game 2 of the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals). Players assigned to power play or penalty killing duties are often known as &quot;special teams&quot;.

If the team with the power play scores a goal while the other team is short-handed, the penalty is over, except if a goal was scored during a major penalty or a match penalty in regulation time. In the Professional Women&#x27;s Hockey League in North America, a minor penalty ends if &quot;either team&quot; scores a goal.

In leagues that reduce the number of players on the ice in overtime, the concept still exists, but is slightly modified to accommodate the reduced team size. For example, overtime during regular-season NHL games uses a 3-on-3 format, with each side having three skaters plus the goaltender. If a player is penalized during overtime, he is sent to the penalty box, but can be replaced by another player. However, the non-penalized team receives an extra skater for the duration of the penalty. If the penalty expires without a goal being scored, the extra skater is removed from the ice and play continues. If regulation time ends with a power play in progress, the advantaged team will start overtime with more than three skaters (almost always four, very rarely five).

==5-on-3==
A team can have two players in the penalty box, but can only be limited to three players on the ice at any given time. If the other team is at full strength and the penalized team has two players in the penalty box, plus a goalie in net, the situation is called a Five on three. This situation gives the team on the power play an even greater chance of scoring. If the advantaged team on the 5-on-3 scores, the player who took the earlier of the two penalties may return to the ice, and play resumes as a power play with only one player in the penalty box. However, if the first penalty taken was a double-minor penalty, the penalty that expires is the first penalty of the double-minor, and the clock then begins to run down on the second penalty, with the 5-on-3 continuing.

A call for too many men on the ice in a 5-on-3 situation in the last two minutes of regulation or in overtime now results in a penalty shot. This current rule resulted from Coach Roger Neilson&#x27;s exploitation of rule loopholes during an OHL game when his team was up one goal, but was down two men in a five-on-three situation for the last minute of the game. Realizing that more penalties could not be served under the existing rules, Neilson put too many men on the ice every ten seconds. The referees stopped the play and a face-off was held, relieving pressure on the defense.

In regular-season overtime in the NHL, a 5-on-3 situation is possible if two players on one team are serving penalties at the same time.

==Short-handed goals==
A short-handed goal is a goal scored in ice hockey when a team&#x27;s on-ice players are outnumbered by the opposing team&#x27;s. Normally, a team would be outnumbered because of a penalty incurred. However, the opposing team on the power play often only has one defenseman at the rear rather than the typical two, in favor of adding another attacker. This strategy can often be exploited by the short-handed team, if they do manage to get the puck out into the neutral zone leaving most of the opposing players behind, and the penalty killers may enjoy odd man rushes and breakaways against the single defenseman of the advantaged team. As previously noted, the suspension of icing rules also allows passes to be longer and the puck to be dumped and chased without stopping play. Unlike power play goals, short-handed goals cannot end penalties except if a short-handed goal is scored in overtime, which automatically ends the game.

When one team pulls its goaltender near the end of a game to play with an extra attacker, any goal scored on the empty net is not considered to be short-handed, because there are equal numbers of players on ice for the teams.

Short-handed goals are somewhat infrequent when a team is down one player, and some instances have occurred where two short-handed goals have been scored on the same penalty. Very rarely is a short-handed goal scored by a team that is down two players (the general approach when down two men is for the opposing team to assume the &quot;iron cross:&quot; establish a diamond shape with one forward, two defensemen and the goaltender, remain in the defensive zone, and clear the puck whenever possible, without making any effort to make an offensive play and jeopardize the already weakened defensive position). Former Philadelphia Flyers captain Mike Richards holds the record for most career 3-on-5 goals with three, having attained the last one during the 2008–09 season. The quickest trio of short-handed goals ever scored in a National Hockey League (NHL) game occurred on April 10, 2010, during a game at the TD Garden between the Boston Bruins and Carolina Hurricanes, when the Bruins scored three short-handed goals against Carolina&#x27;s goaltender Cam Ward in only 1:04 of game time, during a minor hooking penalty to Bruins defenseman Matt Hunwick. The Boston Bruins also made NHL history for those short-handed goals, as it was the first time that a team scored three times on a single penalty kill (Daniel Paille, Blake Wheeler, Steve Bégin). The most short-handed goals ever scored in one NHL game by one team occurred on April 7, 1995, when the Winnipeg Jets scored four, the most since the end of the era of the Original Six teams of the NHL.

<doc id="510447" wikidata="Q808644" url="?curid=510447" title="Baron Methuen">
<text>Baron Methuen, of Corsham in the County of Wiltshire, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1838 for the former Member of Parliament for Wiltshire and Wiltshire North, Paul Methuen. His grandson, the third Baron (who succeeded his father), was a distinguished soldier who became Field marshal. His son, the fourth Baron, was a professional artist and Royal Academician. On his death, the title passed to his younger brother, the fifth Baron. The seventh Baron, who succeeded his elder brother in 1994, was one of the ninety hereditary peers elected to the House of Lords after the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sat on the Liberal Democrat benches. , the title is held by his first cousin once removed, the eighth baron, who succeeded to the title in that year.

The first Baron&#x27;s grandfather, Paul Methuen, was the cousin and heir of the wealthy Sir Paul Methuen, a well-known politician, courtier, diplomat and patron of art and literature, who was the son of John Methuen (c. 1650 – 1706), Lord Chancellor of Ireland between 1697 and 1703 and ambassador to Portugal. It was the last-named who in 1703 negotiated the famous Methuen Treaty, which, in return for the admission of English woollens into Portugal, granted differential duty favouring the importation of Portuguese wines into England to the disadvantage of French wines, and thus contributed to the replacement of the drinking of burgundy by that of port.

The family seat is Corsham Court, in Corsham, Wiltshire.

<text>Tench Tilghman (, December 25, 1744April 18, 1786) was an officer in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He served as an aide-de-camp to General George Washington, achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel.

Tilghman rose to become a trusted member of Washington&#x27;s staff. The historic events of the time sparked his transformation from a privileged family member of Loyalists to a dedicated Patriot. He paid a high price, facing tragedies including a split with Loyalist members of his family, and illness and an early death from disease contracted during the American Revolutionary War.

==Early life, education, and career==

Tilghman was born on December 25, 1744, at Fausley, a plantation owned by his father, James Tilghman, located on Fausley Creek, a branch of the Miles River, in Talbot County, Maryland, a few miles from the town of Easton. His mother was Anne Francis Tilghman; his father was a lawyer and noted Loyalist. Like many prominent planter families of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, the Tilghman family had social and business ties with business elites in Philadelphia, and has intermarried with some prominent Philadelphia families. Tilghman was the eldest of six brothers and four sisters.

Tilghman likely attended a plantation school, and subsequently was schooled by John Gordon, rector of St. Michael&#x27;s Parish. He was sent by his grandfather, Tench Francis, to Philadelphia in 1758, at the age of 14, to the Academy and College of Philadelphia (which later evolved into the University of Pennsylvania), from which he was graduated in May 1761. Tilghman then became a partner in Francis-Tilghman Company, a mercantile business formed with Tench Francis, Jr., an uncle on his mother&#x27;s side. The enterprise was initially successful but dissolved in 1775.

==Revolutionary service==
In July 1775, the Second Continental Congress appointed him to one of the commissioners directed to make treaties with Indians along the frontier, seeking to ensure that they would remain neutral in the American Revolutionary War. Tench was named to the commission to the Six Nations (Iroquois Confederacy) and tribes towards the north.

In the summer of 1775, Tilghman became a lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion of the Philadelphia volunteer light infantry company commanded by Sharpe Dulaney. The company was integrated into the Continental Army in New Jersey in the Flying Camp military formation in June or July 1776. On August 8, 1776, he became one of the aides-de-camp to George Washington, the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. How Tilghman came to join Washington&#x27;s staff is a mystery, but the Washington family and Tilghman family had familial connections. 

Tilghman served Washington as secretary until the end of the war, mostly without pay. Before Colonel Alexander Hamilton (then a young artillery officer) joined Washington&#x27;s staff, Tilghman was the only aide-de-camp to Washington who was conversant in the French language, a critical skill given the many French military men who had joined the revolutionary cause. During the Battle of Monmouth in 1778 and afterwards, Tilghman interpreted written and verbal communications between Washington, Lafayette, Von Steuben, and commanders of the Continental Army&#x27;s French allies.

Tilghman&#x27;s Patriot loyalties split his family. He became the first among his eleven siblings to join the Revolutionary cause. Most of the Tilghman family served the King, as did many other rich families at that time. His brothers Richard and Philemon served in the British military. Another brother, William Tilghman, wanted to follow in their father&#x27;s path and study law in England, which created a professional conflict for Tench Tilghman, who refused him passage to England on June 12, 1781.

I am placed in as delicate a situation as it is possible for a man to be. I am, from my station, a master of the most valuable secrets of the Cabinet, and the master of the field and it might give cause of umbrage and suspicion at this critical moment to interest myself in procuring the passage of a brother to England.

The Siege of Yorktown in October 1781 culminated in a Patriot victory and an honor for Tilghman, whom Washington picked to carry the surrender papers to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. On October 29, 1781, the Continental Congress voted Tilghman &quot;a horse properly caparisoned and an elegant sword in testimony of their high opinion of his merit and ability.&quot; Tilghman&#x27;s ride from Yorktown to Philadelphia was commemorated in poems by Clinton Scollard and Howard Pyle. Tilghman&#x27;s own journal entry was terse:
In the morning Lord Cornwallis put out a letter requesting 24 hours must be granted to the commissioners to settle terms of capitulation of the posts of York and Gloster. The General answered that only two hours would be allowed for him to send out his terms. He accordingly sent them out generally as follows, that the Garrisons should be prisoners of war, the German and British soldiers to be sent to England and Germany. The General answered on the 18th that the terms of sending the troops to England and Germany were inadmissible. Lord Cornwallis closed with all the terms except the same honors granted at Charlestown.

In a letter to Tilghman the following year, Washington&#x27;s humor and admiration is apparent:

Till your letter of the 28th arrived which is the first from you and the only direct account of you since we departed at Philadelphia, we have various conjectures about you. Some thought you were dead—others that you were married—and all that you have forgot us. Your letter is not a more evident contradiction of the first and last of these suppositions than it is a tacit conformation of the second and as none can wish you greater success in the prosecution of the plan you are upon than I do...you have no friend who wishes more to see you than I do.

As the war formally ended with peace negotiations, Washington discussed the surrender of King George III with his trusted aide:

The obstinacy of the King and his unwillingness to acknowledge the independency of this country, I have ever considered as the greatest obstacles in the way of a peace.

==Later life and death==

The National Park Service writes that Tilghman was even sick during his ride from Yorktown to Philadelphia &quot;with chills and fever&quot; and that he left the army in 1783 with failing health. Nonetheless, he restarted his business after the war, shipping wheat, tobacco, and other American products to Spain, in exchange for which Valentin Riera [head of a Spanish company] shipped wine and manufactured products to Baltimore.

On June 9, 1783, in St. Michael&#x27;s Parish, Tilghman married Anna Maria Tilghman, his first cousin and daughter of Matthew Tilghman. Together they had two children: Anna Margaretta, born May 24, 1784, and Elizabeth Tench, born October 11, 1786.

Tilghman was admitted as an original member of The Society of the Cincinnati of Maryland when it was established in November 1783. He died in Chestertown, Maryland, on April 18, 1786, at the age of 41.

Washington&#x27;s regard for Tilghman can be inferred from their joint portrait with Lafayette by Charles Wilson Peale. After Tilghman&#x27;s death, Washington wrote to his brother Thomas Ringgold Tilghman and to his father James Tilghman:

As there were few men for whom I had a warmer friendship, or greater regard than for your Brother—Colonel Tilghman—when living; so, with much truth I can assure you, that, there are none whose death I could more sincerely have regretted. and I pray you, &amp; his numerous friends to permit me to mingle my sorrows with theirs on this unexpected &amp; melancholy occasion.

Of all the numerous acquaintances of your lately deceased son, &amp; amidst all the sorrowings that are mingled on that melancholy occasion, I may venture to assert that (excepting those of his nearest relatives) none could have felt his death with more regret than I did—No one entertained a higher opinion of his worth, or had imbibed sentiments of greater friendship for him than I had done.

==Posthumous honors==
Tilghman is buried in a historic cemetery in Oxford, Maryland. The horizontal lid on his grave vault references his achievements under Washington. A brass plaque on the stone lid notes that his remains were reinterred from Old St. Paul&#x27;s, Baltimore on November 30, 1971. Adjacent to his grave, the Tench Tilghman Monument is a spire.

The Maryland State Archives has a painting of Tilghman and two swords which he once owned, which his descendant Mrs. Judith Goldsborough Oates donated to the State of Maryland on December 26, 1997.

The Tench Tilghman Elementary/Middle School, part of the Baltimore City Public Schools, is named in his honor. He is also the namesake of a Baltimore City recreation center and a Daughters of the American Revolution chapter in Bethesda, Maryland.

The second Lord Monteagle was a unionist politician and was made a Knight of the Order of St Patrick in 1885. On his death, the title passed to his son, the third Baron. He held minor diplomatic office. He was succeeded by his uncle, the fourth Baron. He was the younger son of the aforementioned the Hon. Stephen Edmund Spring Rice, eldest son of the first Baron. the title is held by the fourth Baron&#x27;s great-grandson, the seventh Baron, who succeeded his father in 2013.

<text>Gerhard Ludwig (1909–1994) was a German bookseller.

Born into a very poor working-class family in Berlin, his mother worked in an ammunitions factory, and his father was a beer deliverer and an alcoholic. During the Third Reich he worked for the Frankfurter Zeitung, a newspaper which sheltered non-conformist writers. He was imprisoned in Sachsenhausen between 1941 and 1945, for writing a cheeky post-card about pompous Nazi references to Frederick the Great. He was liberated by the Red Army on April 22, 1945, by which time he had developed severe tuberculosis. In 1946, he received a credit and took over the bookshop in Cologne main station. Between 1950 and 1956, he illegally used the third-class waiting hall in Cologne main station for political and cultural discussion events (&quot;Mittwochgespräche&quot;), which were important for German education in democracy. Well known
public figures had to face a crowd and answer questions they would not know beforehand - something completely unknown in Germany before. The events stopped when Cologne main station was re-designed after 1956.

Among the invited guests were
*Heinrich Böll
*Ernst von Salomon
*Gustaf Gründgens
*Werner Finck
and all members of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s cabinet, with the sole exception of Adenauer himself.

He created the first shop for paperbacks. His shops were leased from the German Railway Authority (Deutsche Bundesbahn), and while he succeeded in cheating on the lease rates for many years, he was eventually found out and - under pressure from creditors - had to sell his shops in 1988.</text><links>

<text>The Chevrolet Corsica (named after Corsica, France) is a front-wheel drive compact car that was produced by Chevrolet from 1987 until 1996. The Corsica was built upon the L-body platform. It shared the L-body with the 2-door Beretta, and the rebadged revival of the Pontiac Tempest which was essentially the same car, but was only sold in Canada and Middle East. The Corsica came in two styles and four trims. Sold initially only as a 4-door sedan, it was also available as a 5-door hatchback from model years 1989 until 1991. Corsicas were built alongside the Beretta by both the Wilmington Assembly in Delaware and Linden Assembly in New Jersey.

==Year-to-year changes==

===1987–1989===
The Corsica was first sold as a fleet car to rental agencies and large companies in 1987, prior to mainstream release. The Corsica and Beretta were the second best-selling passenger cars in America in calendar year 1988, right behind the Ford Escort. Much of the suspension components were borrowed from the J-body Chevrolet Cavalier, and the chassis was an extension of that of the J-body, but modeled with similar proportions to the N-body. The L-body platform however, was engineered by Chevrolet rather than Oldsmobile. The car was equipped with either the 2.0 L TBI OHV I4 from the Cavalier, or the 2.8 L MPFI OHV V6 from the Chevrolet Celebrity. The base Corsica&#x27;s door handles were colored silver, while the Corsica LT/LTZ had black-colored handles. Some earlier models had a column shifter with a handbrake between the front seats, an uncommon configuration for most compact cars of the time. A 5-door hatchback model was introduced for 1989, as was an LTZ performance package that included many suspension parts from the Beretta. A rare XT trim included all the performance parts from the LTZ trim as well as a leather interior, special body kit and spoiler package designed for GM by a third party supplier.
===1990===
The base model Corsica was dropped, leaving the LT and LTZ. Both engines offered were increased in displacement. The Corsica now either used the same 2.2 L 4-cylinder engine and 3-speed automatic transmission as the Cavalier, or the 3.1 L V6 and 3-speed automatic from the Lumina. Minor changes were made to the interior, mostly around the driver controls.

===1991===

For 1991 the Corsica received an extensively updated interior with a standard driver&#x27;s side airbag and cup holders. The front seatbelts were moved from the doors to the B-pillars. The taillights also received a redesign, going from smooth to ridged. This would also be the last year for the five-door hatchback.

===1992===

The only trim level was the LT. The manual transmission was dropped for the V6; it remained available for the four-cylinder engine, although it was only available through special order (few of which ever took place). The 2.2 L OHV engine was now upgraded with sequential fuel-injection (SFI) in the Corsica, unlike the version in the Cavalier which used multi-point fuel injection (MPFI).

===1993===
On automatic transmission vehicles, a shift interlock, which required the brake pedal to be applied before the transmission could be taken out of the park position, as well as a low oil level light was added. The 3.1 L V6 equipped cars also lost the &quot;3.1L Multi-Port V6&quot; fender badge.

===1994===
The LT model took the place of the base model once again. The 2.2 L engine&#x27;s power output was increased to 120 hp. The 3.1 L V6 was replaced with the updated &quot;Gen III&quot; &quot;3100-series&quot; engine (Option code L82) with SFI and an output of 160 hp along with an OBD-1.5 System. This new OBD system was not compatible with either OBD-I or OBD-II but included some features from both systems.

The air conditioning system was upgraded to use R-134a refrigerant, replacing the environmentally-harmful R-12.

The 3-speed automatic transmission on V6 models was replaced with a 4-speed electronically-controlled automatic transmission with overdrive, and lubricated with 100,000 mile long-life fluid. The 2.2 L engine retained the same 3-speed automatic, but the 4-speed automatic could be special ordered. The front seat belts were moved from the B-pillars to the doors. The manual transmission was also dropped for all US Corsicas this model year, due to lack of consumer demand, although many export models and the Beretta still retained this option.

===1995===

The Corsica became the first American car to be equipped with daytime running lights as a standard feature. A new Corsica logo was introduced along with other minor cosmetic exterior changes, such as the introduction of body-colored mirrors, side moldings, and grille. The car also received a revised rear suspension, similar to that of the then-newly redesigned Cavalier. This slightly reduced the &quot;floatiness&quot; of the ride which occurred with earlier models. All Corsicas now came with Dex-Cool engine coolant. The car also received a new tire size, 195/70R14 for longer tire life and better handling.

===1996===
The Corsica was converted fully to OBD-II. GM discontinued the Corsica and the Chevrolet Beretta after the 1996 model year, due to safety standards in 1997 that would have required a total redesign of these cars, and competition from the similarly sized redesigned Chevrolet Cavalier for compact car sales. The Corsica was replaced by the larger Chevrolet Malibu for the 1997 model year.

===Engines===

Notes:
*Both the 2.8 L V6 and 2.0 L I4 received a longer stroke crankshaft in the 1990 model year, respectively increasing their displacements to 3.1 L and 2.2 L.
*In the 1992 model year, sequential fuel injection replaced throttle-body injection on the I4 and in 1994 it replaced MPFI on the V6 models. The updated OBD system is sometimes referred to as OBD 1.5.

<text>Baron Moncreiff, of Tulliebole in the County of Kinross, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 9 January 1874 for the lawyer and Liberal politician Sir James Moncreiff, 1st Baronet. He had already been created a Baronet, of Kilduff in the County of Kinross, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 23 May 1871. In 1883 Lord Moncreiff also succeeded his elder brother as 11th Baronet, of Moncreiff in the County of Perth. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the second Baron. He was a Judge of the Court of Session from 1888 to 1905 under the title of &quot;Lord Wellwood&quot; and served as Lord Lieutenant of Kinross-shire between 1901 and 1909. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baron. He was a clergyman. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s great-grandson, the sixth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2002.

The Moncreiff Baronetcy, of Moncreiff in the County of Perth, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia in 1626 for John Moncreiff. The title was created with remainder to Moncreiff&#x27;s heirs male whatsoever, which allowed it to be inherited by male relatives who were not his direct descendants. On the death of his younger son James, the fourth Baronet, there were no more male descendants of the first Baronet. The title instead passed to James&#x27;s cousin John Moncreiff, who was the son of Hugh Moncreiff, youngest brother of the first Baronet. When his son Hugh, the sixth Baronet, died, this line of the family also failed. The title was inherited by his kinsman Reverend William Moncreiff, the seventh Baronet, a descendant of Archibald Moncreiff, uncle of the first Baronet. His son, the eighth Baronet, assumed the additional surname of Wellwood. He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Baronet. He was a Lord of Session. His younger son was the aforementioned eleventh Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage in 1874.

As of 30 June 2006, the present holder of the barony has not successfully proven his succession to the baronetcies and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage. However, the case is under review by the Registrar of the Baronetage (for more information follow this link).

The family seat is Tullibole Castle in Kinross-shire.

<doc id="510485" wikidata="Q2063189" url="?curid=510485" title="Angiostatin">
<text>Angiostatin is a naturally occurring protein found in several animal species, including humans. It is an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor (i.e., it blocks the growth of new blood vessels). Clinical trials have been undertaken for its use in anticancer therapy.

==Structure==
Angiostatin is a 38 kDa fragment of a larger protein, plasmin (itself a fragment of plasminogen) enclosing three to five contiguous kringle modules. Each module contains two small beta sheets and three disulfide bonds.

There are four different structural variants to angiostatin differing in the combination of kringle domains: K1-3, K1-4, K1-5, K1-4 with a fragment of K-5. Each kringle domain contributes a different element of inhibition to the cytokine. Recent studies through recombinant angiostatin have shown however that K1-3 is pivotal is the inhibitory nature of angiostatin.

K1-3 form the “triangular bowl-like structure” of angiostatin. This structure is stabilized by interactions between inter-kringle peptides and kringles, although the kringle domains do not directly interact with each other. Angiostatin is effectively divided into two sides. The active site of K1 is found on one side, while the active sites of K2 and K3 are found on the other. This is hypothesized to result in the two different functions of angiostatin. The K1 side is believed to be primarily responsible for the inhibition of cellular proliferation, while the K2-K3 sides is believed to be primarily responsible for the inhibition of cell migration.

==Generation==

Angiostatin is produced, for example, by autoproteolytic cleavage of plasminogen, involving extracellular disulfide bond reduction by phosphoglycerate kinase. Furthermore, angiostatin can be cleaved from plasminogen by different metalloproteinases (MMPs), elastase, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), 13 KD serine protease, or 24KD endopeptidase.

==Biological activity==
Angiostatin is known to bind many proteins, especially to angiomotin and endothelial cell surface ATP synthase but also integrins, annexin II, C-met receptor, NG2 proteoglycan, tissue-type plasminogen activator, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, and CD26. Additionally, smaller fragments of angiostatin may bind several other proteins. There is still considerable uncertainty on its mechanism of action, but it seems to involve inhibition of endothelial cell migration, proliferation and induction of apoptosis. It has been proposed that angiostatin activity is related, among other things, to the coupling of its mechanical and redox properties.

Although the exact mechanisms of action of angiostatin has not been completely understood yet, there are three proposed mechanism of action. The first proposed mechanism of action is that angiostatin binds to F1-FoATP synthase found both in the mitochondria and on the cellular membrane of epithelial cells which not only inhibits ATP production in tumor cells but also inhibits the cell&#x27;s ability to maintain the acidic pH of tumor cells. This inability to regulate the intracellular pH can initiate apoptosis. Another proposed mechanism of action is that angiostatin is able to reduce epithelial cell migration by binding to avB3-integrins. However studies have shown that avB3-integrins are not critically essential for angiogenesis, so more investigation is require to ascertain how the inhibition of avB3-integrins inhibit epithelial cell migration. Another proposed mechanism of action is that angiostatin binds to Angiomotin (AMOT) and activating focal adhesion kinase (FAK). FAK has been shown to promote the inhibition of cell proliferation and cell migration, but lack of knowledge on how angiostatin and angiomotin function necessitate that addition research is required.

<text>Baron Montagu of Beaulieu (, Engl. pronunciation: &quot;bewley&quot;, from French &quot;beau&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;lieu&quot;, &quot;place&quot;), in the County of Hampshire, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1885 for the Conservative politician Lord Henry Montagu Douglas Scott, who had earlier represented Selkirkshire and South Hampshire in the House of Commons. He was the second son of Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch (see the Duke of Buccleuch for earlier history of the family). His son, the second Baron, sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for New Forest. The 3rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu was one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sat on the Conservative benches. As descendants of the 5th Duke of Buccleuch, the Barons Montagu of Beaulieu are also in remainder to this peerage and its subsidiary titles.

==History==
The seat of the Barons Montagu of Beaulieu is Beaulieu Palace House in Beaulieu, Hampshire. The house, built around the gatehouse of the monastery of Beaulieu Abbey (the extensive ruins of which are a major feature of the estate), was purchased in 1538 by Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton, when the abbey was dissolved by Henry VIII. The house came into the Montagu family through the marriage of Ralph Montagu, 3rd Baron Montagu, and Lady Elizabeth Wriothesley, daughter of Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton.

The first title to be created in the name of Beaulieu was for Edward Hussey. He was the husband of Lady Isabella Montagu, widow of William Montagu, 2nd Duke of Manchester, and daughter of John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu, and adopted the surname of Hussey-Montagu in 1749. He was created Baron Beaulieu in 1762 and Earl of Beaulieu in 1784. Both titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain, and became extinct on his death in 1802.

The representation of the Montagu family (along with that of the Douglases, Dukes of Queensberry) later passed to the Scott family, headed by the Duke of Buccleuch, through the marriage of Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch, to Lady Elizabeth Montagu, daughter of George Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu (of the 1766 creation). The Scotts then adopted the surname of Montagu Douglas Scott. As mentioned above, Lord Henry Montagu Douglas Scott, second son of the fifth Duke of Buccleuch, was created Baron Montagu of Beaulieu in 1885 and thereafter changed his surname to Douglas-Scott-Montagu.

The late owner of Beaulieu and his eldest son were both featured in &quot;Lord Montagu&quot;, a documentary by Luke Korem about Edward Montagu-Scott’s life and accomplishments. The film was screened twice at the Newport Beach Film Festival in Newport Beach, California, in 2013.

<text>Baron Merthyr, of Senghenydd in the County of Glamorgan, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1911 for the Welsh coal mining magnate Sir William Lewis, 1st Baronet. He had already been created a baronet, of Nantgwyne in the County of Glamorgan, in 1896. The barony is named after the town of Merthyr Tydfil, where Lewis was born. Lord Merthyr&#x27;s grandson, the third Baron, was Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords from 1957 to 1965 and a Deputy Speaker from 1957 to 1974. The latter was succeeded by his son, the fourth Baron. He disclaimed the peerage for life on 26 April 1977, three weeks after succeeding his father. He did not use his title of baronet either. He died on 5 August 2015.

The Hon. Robin Lewis, fourth son of the third Baron, was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Dyfed in December 2006, although this was not officially reported in the London Gazette until September 2007.

<doc id="510501" wikidata="Q7301159" url="?curid=510501" title="Real gross domestic product">
<text>Real gross domestic product (real GDP) is a macroeconomic measure of the value of economic output adjusted for price changes (i.e. inflation or deflation). This adjustment transforms the money-value measure, nominal GDP, into an index for quantity of total output. Although GDP is total output, it is primarily useful because it closely approximates the total spending: the sum of consumer spending, investment made by industry, excess of exports over imports, and government spending. Due to inflation, nominal GDP can increase even when physical output is fixed, and so does not actually reflect the true growth in an economy. That is why the GDP must be divided by the inflation rate (raised to the power of units of time in which the rate is measured) to get the growth of the real GDP. Different organizations use different types of &#x27;Real GDP&#x27; measures, for example, the UNCTAD uses 2015 Constant prices and exchange rates while the FRED uses 2009 constant prices and exchange rates, and recently the World Bank switched from 2005 to 2010 constant prices and exchange rates.

Real GDP contrasts with real gross domestic income, which is adjusted for price changes with a different method.

== Economic sectors of nations using real GDP ==


==Relationship with nominal GDP==
Real GDP is an example of the distinction between real and nominal values in economics. Nominal gross domestic product is defined as the market value of all final goods produced in a geographical region, usually a country; this depends on the quantities of goods and services produced, and their respective prices.

If a set of real GDPs from various years are calculated, each using the quantities from its own year, but all using the prices from the same base year, the differences in those real GDPs will reflect only differences in volume.

An index called the GDP deflator can be obtained by dividing, for each year, the nominal GDP by the real GDP, so that the GDP deflator for the base year will be 100. It gives an indication of the overall level of price change (inflation or deflation) in the economy.

:GDP deflator for year formula_1

Real GDP growth on an annual basis is the nominal GDP growth rate adjusted for inflation. It is usually expressed as a percentage.

&quot;GDP&quot; may refer to &quot;nominal&quot; or &quot;current&quot; or &quot;historical&quot; GDP, to distinguish it from real GDP. Real GDP is sometimes called &quot;constant&quot; GDP because it is expressed in terms of constant prices. Depending on context, &quot;GDP&quot; may also refer to real GDP.

<text>Mpande kaSenzangakhona (c. 1798–18 October 1872) was monarch of the Zulu Kingdom from 1840 to 1872. He was a half-brother of Sigujana, Shaka and Dingane, who preceded him as Zulu kings. He came to power after he had overthrown Dingane in 1840.

His reign was relatively lengthy at 32 years, but for the latter part of his reign, he was king in name only. His son Cetshwayo became &quot;de facto&quot; ruler in 1856. Mpande himself claimed that he preferred a quiet life and that he had been forced to become king.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Mpande was born in Babanango, Zululand, the son of Senzangakhona kaJama (1762–1816) and his ninth wife Songiya kaNgotsha Hlabisa. He was considered a weak man in comparison to his contemporaries. While other half-brothers were eliminated when his brother Dingane assassinated Shaka to become king in 1828, he was allowed to live. Mpande apparently showed no interest in Zulu power politics.

Mpande came to prominence when Dingane suffered a catastrophic disaster at the Battle of Blood River in December 1838. His defeat at the hands of the Boers led to unrest, which Dingane attempted to control by eliminating potential successors such as Mpande. In September 1839 Mpande defied his brother, who demanded his support in a war against the Swazi people. Fearing he would be killed if he joined Dingane, Mpande instead led thousands of Zulus into the Boer republic of Natalia. The Boers led by Andries Pretorius and Gert Rudolph decided to support Mpande, hoping to gain concessions if he could oust Dingane. In January 1840 Mpande&#x27;s army led by Nongalaza defeated Dingane at the Battle of Maqongqo. Mpande arrived shortly after with Pretorius&#x27; force of Boers, and was proclaimed king.

After executing his own general Ndlela kaSompisi, Dingane escaped, but was soon murdered in Hlatikhulu Forest. Mpande was now unopposed as king. Mpande later claimed that he had been forced to become king against his own wishes. The Boers immediately were granted claim to a large stretch of territory in exchange for their help.

===Early reign===
In October 1843 British commissioner Henry Cloete negotiated a treaty to define the borders of Natal and Zululand. Mpande also negotiated with the Boers, ceding land around the Klip River in 1847, which the British considered a violation of the treaty. Mpande had to reoccupy the land with his own troops. Mpande managed to avoid further disputes with the British but continued to grant favours to the Boers.

In 1843 Mpande ordered the death of his brother Gqugqu, who was said to be plotting to kill the king. Gqugqu&#x27;s wives and children were also killed. The massacre produced a large influx of refugees into Natal led by his aunt Mawa kaJama; according to British colonial official Abraham Josias Cloëté, nearly all kraals as far north as Nseleni had been deserted.

Mpande adopted an expansionist policy in the early 1850s, initially raiding the areas surrounding the Zulu kingdom. These moves culminated in the invasion of Swaziland in 1852. The Swazi were under Zulu suzerainty, but maintained effective independence under Mswati II. According to historian Philip Bonner, Mpande wanted Swaziland to be under his control because of fears of Boer expansion from Natal. He &quot;was intent on turning Swaziland into a physical sanctuary should he become embroiled with Natal, and was not prepared to settle for anything less than effective control&quot;. The Zulu invasion was a success to the extent that the Swazi were faced with the prospect of &quot;disintegration and collapse&quot;. During the invasion, Mpande&#x27;s eldest son Cetshwayo proved his capacities as a leader. However, the British pressured him into withdrawing, which he did quickly.

===Succession conflicts===

Cetshwayo&#x27;s success as a leader led to a conflict with Mpande&#x27;s second, and favourite, son Mbuyazi. Though Cetshwayo was the oldest, he was not officially successor, as his mother had not been declared the king&#x27;s Great Wife. Either brother could inherit if Mpande chose their mother as his Great Wife, which he did not. Cetshwayo felt that his father was favouring Mbuyazi, and both sides developed factions of followers. Mpande ceded territory to Mbuyazi on the Tugela River, where he and his followers settled. Mbuyazi also cultivated support from European settlers led by John Dunn. Cetshwayo, who was supported by most of the territorial sub-chiefs, decided to settle the matter militarily. He invaded Mbuyazi&#x27;s lands and crushed his followers at the Battle of Ndondakusuka, massacring survivors, including five of his brothers. Dunn escaped and later became an adviser to Cetshwayo.

After this Cetshwayo became &quot;de facto&quot; ruler, though his father continued to carry out ceremonial functions. Cetshwayo continued his father&#x27;s policy of maintaining links with both the British and the Boers and balancing out concessions. Cetshwayo also kept an eye on his father&#x27;s new wives and children for potential rivals, ordering the death of his favourite wife Nomantshali and her children in 1861. Nomantshali and her daughters were hacked to death. Though two sons escaped, the youngest was murdered in front of the king.

According to Gibson, &quot;in his later days he became so fat he was unable to walk&quot;. The exact date of his death in late 1872 is unclear, as it was kept secret to secure a smooth transition of power to Cetshwayo.

==Assessment==
Mpande&#x27;s apparent passivity has been interpreted in different ways. He has often been identified as a &quot;simpleton&quot; or &quot;the fool of the family&quot;, in the words of J Y Gibson. James O. Gump, however, describes him as a &quot;savvy survivor in the Machiavellian world of Zulu politics&quot;. Gibson himself says that in his youth he was an imposing figure, quoting a French witness who said he had a regal bearing such that &quot;a Parisian might believe that Umpande, in his youth, had frequented the palaces of kings&quot;. However, there is considerable evidence of his &quot;lethargy and indifference&quot; to ruling, even in his early years, when many of the decisions were made by his sons.

Mpande had a positive reputation among Christian missionaries. He allowed John Colenso to codify Zulu grammar and produce Zulu translations of the Bible. Colenso&#x27;s associate, Zulu convert Magema Fuze, gave a Biblically inspired account of the history of the Zulus in his book &quot;The Black People and Whence they Came&quot;. In this account God punishes wicked rulers like Shaka and Dingane, but the Zulus flourish under &quot;Mpande&#x27;s peaceful, enlightened rule.&quot; Cetshwayo was cursed because of his impious murder of Nomantshali.

H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s Allan Quatermain novel &quot;Child of Storm&quot; is set during the power struggle between Cetshwayo and Mbuyazi. Mpande (called &quot;Panda&quot;) is depicted as an indulgent, passive figure.

<doc id="510520" wikidata="Q380403" url="?curid=510520" title="Cetshwayo">
<text>Cetshwayo kaMpande (; ; 1826 – 8 February 1884) was the king of the Zulu Kingdom from 1873 to 1884 and its Commander in Chief during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. His name has been transliterated as Cetawayo, Cetewayo, Cetywajo and Ketchwayo. Cetshwayo consistently opposed the war and sought fruitlessly to make peace with the British and was defeated and exiled following the Zulu defeat in the war. He was later allowed to return to Zululand, where he died in 1884.

==Early life==
Cetshwayo was a son of Zulu king Mpande and Queen Ngqumbazi, half-nephew of Zulu king Shaka and grandson of Senzangakhona. In 1856 he defeated and killed in battle his younger brother Mbuyazi, Mpande&#x27;s favourite, at the Battle of Ndondakusuka. Almost all of Mbuyazi&#x27;s followers were massacred in the aftermath of the battle, including five of Cetshwayo&#x27;s brothers. Following this he became the ruler of the Zulu people in everything but name. However, he did not ascend to the throne as his father was still alive. Stories from that time regarding his huge size vary, saying he stood at least between and in height and weighed close to .

His other brother, Umthonga, was still a potential rival. Cetshwayo also kept an eye on his father&#x27;s new wives and children for potential rivals, ordering the death of his favourite wife, Nomantshali, and her children in 1861. Though two sons escaped, the youngest was murdered in front of the king. After these events Umthonga fled to the Boers&#x27; side of the border and Cetshwayo had to make deals with the Boers to get him back. In 1865, Umthonga again fled across the border, apparently making Cetshwayo believe that Umthonga would organize help from the Boers against him, the same way his father had overthrown his predecessor, Dingane.

Furthermore, he had a rival half-brother named uHamu kaNzibe, who betrayed the Zulu cause on numerous occasions.

==Reign==

Mpande died in 1872. His death was first concealed to ensure a smooth transition; Cetshwayo was installed as king on 1 September 1873. Sir Theophilus Shepstone, who annexed the Transvaal to the Cape Colony, crowned Cetshwayo. Shepstone eventually turned on the Zulus, as he felt he was undermined by Cetshwayo&#x27;s skillful negotiations for land area and compromised by encroaching Boers, as well as the fact that the Boundary Commission established to examine the ownership of the land in question had dared to rule in favour of the Zulus. The report was subsequently buried.

After his coronation, as was customary, Cetshwayo established a new capital for the nation and called it Ulundi &quot;(the high place)&quot;. He expanded his army and readopted many methods of Shaka. Cetshwayo also equipped his impis with muskets, though evidence of their use is limited. He banished European missionaries from his land and may have incited other native African peoples to rebel against Boers in the Transvaal.

In 1878, Sir Henry Bartle Frere, British High Commissioner for the Cape Colony, sought to confederate the colony the same way Canada had been and felt that this could not be done while there was a powerful Zulu state bordering it. Frere thus began to demand reparations for Zulu border infractions and ordered his subordinates to send messages complaining about Cetshwayo&#x27;s policies, seeking to provoke the Zulu king. They carried out their orders, but Cetshwayo kept calm, considering the British his friends and being aware of the power of the British Army. He did, however, state that he and Frere were equals, and since he did not complain about how Frere administered the Cape Colony, Frere should observe the same courtesy concerning Zululand. Eventually, Frere issued an ultimatum that demanded that Cetshwayo &quot;de facto&quot; disband his army. His refusal led to war in 1879, though he continually sought to make peace after the Battle of Isandlwana, the first engagement of the war. After an initial decisive but costly Zulu victory over the British at Isandlwana and the failure of the other two columns of the three-pronged British attack to make headway – indeed, one was bogged down in the Siege of Eshowe – the British retreated, other columns suffering two further defeats to Zulu armies in the field at the Battle of Intombe and the Battle of Hlobane. However, the British follow-up victories at Rorke&#x27;s Drift and Kambula prevented a total collapse of the British military positions. While this retreat presented an opportunity for a Zulu counterattack deep into Natal, Cetshwayo refused to mount such an attack; he intended to repulse the British offensive and secure a peace treaty. However, Cetshwayo&#x27;s translator, a Dutch trader he had imprisoned at the start of the war named Cornelius Vijn, gave warnings to Chelmsford of gathering Zulu forces during these negotiations.
The British then returned to Zululand with a far larger and better-armed force, finally capturing the Zulu capital at the Battle of Ulundi, in which the British, having learned their lesson from their defeat at Isandlwana, set up a hollow square on the open plain, armed with cannons and Gatling guns. The battle lasted approximately 45 minutes before the British ordered their cavalry to charge the Zulus, which routed them. After Ulundi was taken and burnt on 4 July, Cetshwayo was deposed and exiled, first to Cape Town and then to London. He returned to Zululand in 1883.

From 1881, his cause had been taken up by, among others, Lady Florence Dixie, correspondent of &quot;The Morning Post&quot;, who wrote articles and books in his support. This, along with his gentle and dignified manner, gave rise to public sympathy and the sentiment that he had been ill-used and shoddily treated by Bartle Frere and Lord Chelmsford.

==Later life==

By 1882, differences between two Zulu factions—pro-Cetshwayo &quot;uSuthus&quot; and three rival chiefs led by Zibhebhu—had erupted into a blood feud and civil war. In 1883, the British government tried to restore Cetshwayo to rule at least part of his previous territory, but the attempt failed. With the aid of Boer mercenaries, Chief Zibhebhu started a war contesting the succession, and on 22 July 1883, he attacked Cetshwayo&#x27;s new kraal in Ulundi. Cetshwayo was wounded but escaped to the forest at Nkandla. After pleas from the Resident Commissioner, Sir Melmoth Osborne, Cetshwayo moved to Eshowe, where he died a few months later on 8 February 1884, aged 57–60, presumably from a heart attack, although there are some theories that he may have been poisoned. His body was buried in a field within sight of the forest, to the south near Nkunzane River. The remains of the wagon that carried his corpse to the site were placed on the grave and may be seen at Ondini Museum, near Ulundi.

Cetshwayo&#x27;s most prominent role in South African historiography is being the last king of the Zulu Kingdom, though it still exists. His son Dinuzulu, as heir to the throne, was proclaimed king on 20 May 1884, supported by (other) Boer mercenaries. A blue plaque commemorates Cetshwayo at 18 Melbury Road, Kensington, London.

==In popular culture==

Cetshwayo figures in three adventure novels by H. Rider Haggard: &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Head&quot; (1885), &quot;Black Heart and White Heart&quot; (1900) and &quot;Finished&quot; (1917), and in his non-fiction book &quot;Cetywayo and His White Neighbours&quot; (1882). He is mentioned in John Buchan&#x27;s novel &quot;Prester John&quot;. In the short story &quot;A Municipal Report&quot; in &quot;Strictly Business&quot; by O. Henry (1910), the face of a key character is compared to that of &quot;King Cettiwayo&quot;. 

A character in the opera &quot;Leo, the Royal Cadet&quot; by Oscar Ferdinand Telgmann and George Frederick Cameron was named in his honour in 1889.

In the 1964 film &quot;Zulu&quot;, he was played by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, his maternal great-grandson and the future leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party.

In the 1979 film &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot;, he was played by Simon Sabela..

In the 1986 miniseries &quot;Shaka Zulu&quot;, he was played by Sokesimbone Kubheka.

There is a brief allusion made to Cetshwayo in the novel &quot;Age of Iron&quot; by J. M. Coetzee in the line &quot;The new Africans, pot-bellied, heavy-jowled men on their stools of office: Cetshwayo, Dingane in white skins.&quot;

&quot;Civilization V: Brave New World&quot; features Cetshwayo as the leader of the Zulus in the Scramble for Africa scenario.

==Legacy==
In 2016, the King Cetshwayo District Municipality was named after him.

<text>Baron Melchett, of Landford in the County of Southampton, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 5 June 1928 for Sir Alfred Mond, 1st Baronet, Chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries and a former First Commissioner of Works and Minister of Health. He had already been created a Baronet, of Hartford Hill in Great Budworth in the County of Chester, on 8 July 1910.

Mond was succeeded by his only son, the second Baron. He was also a politician and businessman. His second but only surviving son, the third Baron, was a businessman. The latter&#x27;s son, the fourth Baron, succeeded in 1973. He held political office under James Callaghan in the late 1970s and was later Executive Director of Greenpeace UK.

Ludwig Mond, father of the first Baron, was an industrialist.

==Barons Melchett (1928)==
*Alfred Moritz Mond, 1st Baron Melchett (1868–1930)
*Henry Ludwig Mond, 2nd Baron Melchett (1898–1949)
*Julian Edward Alfred Mond, 3rd Baron Melchett (1925–1973)
*Peter Robert Henry Mond, 4th Baron Melchett (1948–2018)

The barony and baronetcy became extinct on the death of the 4th Baron in 2018 because his only son was illegitimate, and under peerage law could not succeed to his father&#x27;s titles. According to &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; broadcast on BBC Radio on 4 February 2000, Lord Melchett intentionally had his son out of wedlock because he was against the inheritance of privilege.

<text>In mathematics, a group scheme is a type of object from algebraic geometry equipped with a composition law. Group schemes arise naturally as symmetries of schemes, and they generalize algebraic groups, in the sense that all algebraic groups have group scheme structure, but group schemes are not necessarily connected, smooth, or defined over a field. This extra generality allows one to study richer infinitesimal structures, and this can help one to understand and answer questions of arithmetic significance. The category of group schemes is somewhat better behaved than that of group varieties, since all homomorphisms have kernels, and there is a well-behaved deformation theory. Group schemes that are not algebraic groups play a significant role in arithmetic geometry and algebraic topology, since they come up in contexts of Galois representations and moduli problems. The initial development of the theory of group schemes was due to Alexander Grothendieck, Michel Raynaud and Michel Demazure in the early 1960s.

== Definition ==

A group scheme is a group object in a category of schemes that has fiber products and some final object &quot;S&quot;. That is, it is an &quot;S&quot;-scheme &quot;G&quot; equipped with one of the equivalent sets of data

* a triple of morphisms μ: &quot;G&quot; ×S &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot;, e: &quot;S&quot; → &quot;G&quot;, and ι: &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot;, satisfying the usual compatibilities of groups (namely associativity of μ, identity, and inverse axioms)
* a functor from schemes over &quot;S&quot; to the category of groups, such that composition with the forgetful functor to sets is equivalent to the presheaf corresponding to &quot;G&quot; under the Yoneda embedding. (See also: group functor.)

A homomorphism of group schemes is a map of schemes that respects multiplication. This can be precisely phrased either by saying that a map &quot;f&quot; satisfies the equation &quot;f&quot;μ = μ(&quot;f&quot; × &quot;f&quot;), or by saying that &quot;f&quot; is a natural transformation of functors from schemes to groups (rather than just sets).

A left action of a group scheme &quot;G&quot; on a scheme &quot;X&quot; is a morphism &quot;G&quot; ×S &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot; that induces a left action of the group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) on the set &quot;X&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) for any &quot;S&quot;-scheme &quot;T&quot;. Right actions are defined similarly. Any group scheme admits natural left and right actions on its underlying scheme by multiplication and conjugation. Conjugation is an action by automorphisms, i.e., it commutes with the group structure, and this induces linear actions on naturally derived objects, such as its Lie algebra, and the algebra of left-invariant differential operators.

An &quot;S&quot;-group scheme &quot;G&quot; is commutative if the group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is an abelian group for all &quot;S&quot;-schemes &quot;T&quot;. There are several other equivalent conditions, such as conjugation inducing a trivial action, or inversion map ι being a group scheme automorphism.

== Constructions ==
* Given a group &quot;G&quot;, one can form the constant group scheme &quot;G&quot;&quot;S&quot;. As a scheme, it is a disjoint union of copies of &quot;S&quot;, and by choosing an identification of these copies with elements of &quot;G&quot;, one can define the multiplication, unit, and inverse maps by transport of structure. As a functor, it takes any &quot;S&quot;-scheme &quot;T&quot; to a product of copies of the group &quot;G&quot;, where the number of copies is equal to the number of connected components of &quot;T&quot;. &quot;G&quot;&quot;S&quot; is affine over &quot;S&quot; if and only if &quot;G&quot; is a finite group. However, one can take a projective limit of finite constant group schemes to get profinite group schemes, which appear in the study of fundamental groups and Galois representations or in the theory of the fundamental group scheme, and these are affine of infinite type. More generally, by taking a locally constant sheaf of groups on &quot;S&quot;, one obtains a locally constant group scheme, for which monodromy on the base can induce non-trivial automorphisms on the fibers.
* The existence of fiber products of schemes allows one to make several constructions. Finite direct products of group schemes have a canonical group scheme structure. Given an action of one group scheme on another by automorphisms, one can form semidirect products by following the usual set-theoretic construction. Kernels of group scheme homomorphisms are group schemes, by taking a fiber product over the unit map from the base. Base change sends group schemes to group schemes.
* Group schemes can be formed from smaller group schemes by taking restriction of scalars with respect to some morphism of base schemes, although one needs finiteness conditions to be satisfied to ensure representability of the resulting functor. When this morphism is along a finite extension of fields, it is known as Weil restriction.
* For any abelian group &quot;A&quot;, one can form the corresponding diagonalizable group &quot;D&quot;(&quot;A&quot;), defined as a functor by setting &quot;D&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)(&quot;T&quot;) to be the set of abelian group homomorphisms from &quot;A&quot; to invertible global sections of &quot;O&quot;T for each &quot;S&quot;-scheme &quot;T&quot;. If &quot;S&quot; is affine, &quot;D&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) can be formed as the spectrum of a group ring. More generally, one can form groups of multiplicative type by letting &quot;A&quot; be a non-constant sheaf of abelian groups on &quot;S&quot;.
* For a subgroup scheme &quot;H&quot; of a group scheme &quot;G&quot;, the functor that takes an &quot;S&quot;-scheme &quot;T&quot; to &quot;G&quot;(&quot;T&quot;)/&quot;H&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is in general not a sheaf, and even its sheafification is in general not representable as a scheme. However, if &quot;H&quot; is finite, flat, and closed in &quot;G&quot;, then the quotient is representable, and admits a canonical left &quot;G&quot;-action by translation. If the restriction of this action to &quot;H&quot; is trivial, then &quot;H&quot; is said to be normal, and the quotient scheme admits a natural group law. Representability holds in many other cases, such as when &quot;H&quot; is closed in &quot;G&quot; and both are affine.

== Examples ==

* The multiplicative group Gm has the punctured affine line as its underlying scheme, and as a functor, it sends an &quot;S&quot;-scheme &quot;T&quot; to the multiplicative group of invertible global sections of the structure sheaf. It can be described as the diagonalizable group &quot;D&quot;(Z) associated to the integers. Over an affine base such as Spec &quot;A&quot;, it is the spectrum of the ring &quot;A&quot;[&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;]/(&quot;xy&quot; − 1), which is also written &quot;A&quot;[&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;−1]. The unit map is given by sending &quot;x&quot; to one, multiplication is given by sending &quot;x&quot; to &quot;x&quot; ⊗ &quot;x&quot;, and the inverse is given by sending &quot;x&quot; to &quot;x&quot;−1. Algebraic tori form an important class of commutative group schemes, defined either by the property of being locally on &quot;S&quot; a product of copies of Gm, or as groups of multiplicative type associated to finitely generated free abelian groups.
* The general linear group &quot;GL&quot;&quot;n&quot; is an affine algebraic variety that can be viewed as the multiplicative group of the &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot; matrix ring variety. As a functor, it sends an &quot;S&quot;-scheme &quot;T&quot; to the group of invertible &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot; matrices whose entries are global sections of &quot;T&quot;. Over an affine base, one can construct it as a quotient of a polynomial ring in &quot;n&quot;2 + 1 variables by an ideal encoding the invertibility of the determinant. Alternatively, it can be constructed using 2&quot;n&quot;2 variables, with relations describing an ordered pair of mutually inverse matrices.
* For any positive integer &quot;n&quot;, the group μn is the kernel of the &quot;n&quot;th power map from Gm to itself. As a functor, it sends any &quot;S&quot;-scheme &quot;T&quot; to the group of global sections &quot;f&quot; of &quot;T&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;n = 1. Over an affine base such as Spec &quot;A&quot;, it is the spectrum of &quot;A&quot;[x]/(&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1). If &quot;n&quot; is not invertible in the base, then this scheme is not smooth. In particular, over a field of characteristic &quot;p&quot;, μp is not smooth.
* The additive group Ga has the affine line A1 as its underlying scheme. As a functor, it sends any &quot;S&quot;-scheme &quot;T&quot; to the underlying additive group of global sections of the structure sheaf. Over an affine base such as Spec &quot;A&quot;, it is the spectrum of the polynomial ring &quot;A&quot;[&quot;x&quot;]. The unit map is given by sending &quot;x&quot; to zero, the multiplication is given by sending &quot;x&quot; to 1 ⊗ &quot;x&quot; + &quot;x&quot; ⊗ 1, and the inverse is given by sending &quot;x&quot; to −&quot;x&quot;.
* If &quot;p&quot; = 0 in &quot;S&quot; for some prime number &quot;p&quot;, then the taking of &quot;p&quot;th powers induces an endomorphism of Ga, and the kernel is the group scheme αp. Over an affine base such as Spec &quot;A&quot;, it is the spectrum of &quot;A&quot;[x]/(&quot;x&quot;p).
* The automorphism group of the affine line is isomorphic to the semidirect product of Ga by Gm, where the additive group acts by translations, and the multiplicative group acts by dilations. The subgroup fixing a chosen basepoint is isomorphic to the multiplicative group, and taking the basepoint to be the identity of an additive group structure identifies Gm with the automorphism group of Ga.
* A smooth genus one curve with a marked point (i.e., an elliptic curve) has a unique group scheme structure with that point as the identity. Unlike the previous positive-dimensional examples, elliptic curves are projective (in particular proper).

== Basic properties ==

Suppose that &quot;G&quot; is a group scheme of finite type over a field &quot;k&quot;. Let &quot;G&quot;0 be the connected component of the identity, i.e., the maximal connected subgroup scheme. Then &quot;G&quot; is an extension of a finite étale group scheme by &quot;G&quot;0. &quot;G&quot; has a unique maximal reduced subscheme &quot;G&quot;red, and if &quot;k&quot; is perfect, then &quot;G&quot;red is a smooth group variety that is a subgroup scheme of &quot;G&quot;. The quotient scheme is the spectrum of a local ring of finite rank.

Any affine group scheme is the spectrum of a commutative Hopf algebra (over a base &quot;S&quot;, this is given by the relative spectrum of an &quot;O&quot;S-algebra). The multiplication, unit, and inverse maps of the group scheme are given by the comultiplication, counit, and antipode structures in the Hopf algebra. The unit and multiplication structures in the Hopf algebra are intrinsic to the underlying scheme. For an arbitrary group scheme &quot;G&quot;, the ring of global sections also has a commutative Hopf algebra structure, and by taking its spectrum, one obtains the maximal affine quotient group. Affine group varieties are known as linear algebraic groups, since they can be embedded as subgroups of general linear groups.

Complete connected group schemes are in some sense opposite to affine group schemes, since the completeness implies all global sections are exactly those pulled back from the base, and in particular, they have no nontrivial maps to affine schemes. Any complete group variety (variety here meaning reduced and geometrically irreducible separated scheme of finite type over a field) is automatically commutative, by an argument involving the action of conjugation on jet spaces of the identity. Complete group varieties are called abelian varieties. This generalizes to the notion of abelian scheme; a group scheme &quot;G&quot; over a base &quot;S&quot; is abelian if the structural morphism from &quot;G&quot; to &quot;S&quot; is proper and smooth with geometrically connected fibers. They are automatically projective, and they have many applications, e.g., in geometric class field theory and throughout algebraic geometry. A complete group scheme over a field need not be commutative, however; for example, any finite group scheme is complete.

==Finite flat group schemes==

A group scheme &quot;G&quot; over a noetherian scheme &quot;S&quot; is finite and flat if and only if &quot;O&quot;&quot;G&quot; is a locally free &quot;O&quot;&quot;S&quot;-module of finite rank. The rank is a locally constant function on &quot;S&quot;, and is called the order of &quot;G&quot;. The order of a constant group scheme is equal to the order of the corresponding group, and in general, order behaves well with respect to base change and finite flat restriction of scalars.

Among the finite flat group schemes, the constants (cf. example above) form a special class, and over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, the category of finite groups is equivalent to the category of constant finite group schemes. Over bases with positive characteristic or more arithmetic structure, additional isomorphism types exist. For example, if 2 is invertible over the base, all group schemes of order 2 are constant, but over the 2-adic integers, μ2 is non-constant, because the special fiber isn&#x27;t smooth. There exist sequences of highly ramified 2-adic rings over which the number of isomorphism types of group schemes of order 2 grows arbitrarily large. More detailed analysis of commutative finite flat group schemes over &quot;p&quot;-adic rings can be found in Raynaud&#x27;s work on prolongations.

Commutative finite flat group schemes often occur in nature as subgroup schemes of abelian and semi-abelian varieties, and in positive or mixed characteristic, they can capture a lot of information about the ambient variety. For example, the &quot;p&quot;-torsion of an elliptic curve in characteristic zero is locally isomorphic to the constant elementary abelian group scheme of order &quot;p&quot;2, but over Fp, it is a finite flat group scheme of order &quot;p&quot;2 that has either &quot;p&quot; connected components (if the curve is ordinary) or one connected component (if the curve is supersingular). If we consider a family of elliptic curves, the &quot;p&quot;-torsion forms a finite flat group scheme over the parametrizing space, and the supersingular locus is where the fibers are connected. This merging of connected components can be studied in fine detail by passing from a modular scheme to a rigid analytic space, where supersingular points are replaced by discs of positive radius.

==Cartier duality==
Cartier duality is a scheme-theoretic analogue of Pontryagin duality taking finite commutative group schemes to finite commutative group schemes.

==Dieudonné modules==
Finite flat commutative group schemes over a perfect field &quot;k&quot; of positive characteristic &quot;p&quot; can be studied by transferring their geometric structure to a (semi-)linear-algebraic setting. The basic object is the Dieudonné ring &quot;D&quot; = &quot;W&quot;(&quot;k&quot;){&quot;F&quot;,&quot;V&quot;}/(&quot;FV&quot; − &quot;p&quot;), which is a quotient of the ring of noncommutative polynomials, with coefficients in Witt vectors of &quot;k&quot;. &quot;F&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are the Frobenius and Verschiebung operators, and they may act nontrivially on the Witt vectors. Dieudonne and Cartier constructed an antiequivalence of categories between finite commutative group schemes over &quot;k&quot; of order a power of &quot;p&quot; and modules over &quot;D&quot; with finite &quot;W&quot;(&quot;k&quot;)-length. The Dieudonné module functor in one direction is given by homomorphisms into the abelian sheaf &quot;CW&quot; of Witt co-vectors. This sheaf is more or less dual to the sheaf of Witt vectors (which is in fact representable by a group scheme), since it is constructed by taking a direct limit of finite length Witt vectors under successive Verschiebung maps &quot;V&quot;: &quot;W&quot;n → &quot;W&quot;n+1, and then completing. Many properties of commutative group schemes can be seen by examining the corresponding Dieudonné modules, e.g., connected &quot;p&quot;-group schemes correspond to &quot;D&quot;-modules for which &quot;F&quot; is nilpotent, and étale group schemes correspond to modules for which &quot;F&quot; is an isomorphism.

Dieudonné theory exists in a somewhat more general setting than finite flat groups over a field. Oda&#x27;s 1967 thesis gave a connection between Dieudonné modules and the first de Rham cohomology of abelian varieties, and at about the same time, Grothendieck suggested that there should be a crystalline version of the theory that could be used to analyze &quot;p&quot;-divisible groups. Galois actions on the group schemes transfer through the equivalences of categories, and the associated deformation theory of Galois representations was used in Wiles&#x27;s work on the Shimura–Taniyama conjecture.
